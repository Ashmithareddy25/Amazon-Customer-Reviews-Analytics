0385523912|3.0|I eagerly looked forward to reading this book, as I felt a human portrayal of North Korean society is lacking from much of the literature produced about North Korea. That's why I felt these stories would be very important and had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, the author's tone and overall lack of knowledge of Korean society got in the way of a proper telling of these defectors' stories. Overall, the book is okay if you have very little knowledge of Korea, but any serious student of Korean society will find the book lacking.      First, despite the author's five years experience working in South Korea, it seems she has a shallow understanding of Korean society and culture. One gets the feeling she rarely traveled outside of the Seoul metropolitan area. The author's inability to understand South Korean society spills into her writing about the North in that she misinterprets North Korean cultural practices. Often, she assumes a cultural practice is unique to North Korea, when it is in fact common to both Koreas. One such example is the issue of women smoking cigarettes. The author presents the taboo against women smoking as an example of North Korean male-dominated oppressiveness. However, that same taboo persists in many places throughout South Korea (as many Korean women can attest to). The author gets taken in by the bright lights and sexy billboards of Seoul, and fails to recognize the highly conservative society under the surface. It is, however, no wonder that she fails to understand modern Korean society, as one of the books she cited as a source for her cultural knowledge was printed well over a century ago. Another example of her misinterpretation was when she was discussing a North Korean school book. The school book exhorted the duty of \\"filial piety\\", the author interpreting this phrase as one of the many colorful Communist propaganda slogans. However, \\"filial piety\\" is actually a very rough translation of the Korean word \\"hyo\\" which is the Confucian ideal of respecting one's parents. The same phrase can be easily found in South Korean education, as it is arguably one of the most central principles to Korean society. Beyond misinterpretations, there were statements that were plain false (for example, typifying the North Korean and Busan accents as \\"guttural\\") that belie her lack of knowledge.    The second problem was the writer's style and tone. As I was reading, I always felt that I was not reading the experiences of North Korean defectors, but rather an American journalist's imagining of a North Korean defector's experiences. This was evident in the scenes and sections that the author, as an American writing for an American audience, chose to emphasize (scenes such as the stereotypical realization that not all Americans are \\"evil\\" and that the South is much richer than the North). She also falls into typical American patterns of thinking (i.e. South Korean women are more free than North Korean women because their skirts are shorter - ignoring the fact that, in South Korea, women still make a fraction of the income that men do).    Ultimately, the title promises something the book could never have produced. This is obvious, for how could it accurately portray the \\"ordinary lives\\" of millions of ordinary North Koreans by telling the stories of just the few that managed to escape? That is, of course, not to belittle the importance of these North Korean defectors' stories. They need to be told. Unfortunately, this author didn't tell it well enough.

B000FBFMFW|2.0|Not really much words for this book. It was ok I guess, a bit slow at times, didn't really like the characters, wasn't all that interested in the story. That's just me though. A disappointing sequel to a promising book... oh well.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|I was unsure of this movie as it did not recieve a lot of press, despite the all-star cast. I was, however, pleasantly surprised! The movie follows a washed up drummer trying to make it back to the big leagues, with the help of his nephew's band. A very sterotypical band movie with some really funny extra quirks... like be prepared to laugh hard when they show you how the<br /><br />My only complaint with this movie is that we do not get to see more of Aziz Asari, Bradley Cooper or Will Arnett, who have the comedy chops to take this from a good movie to a great one. Rainn Wilson and Jane Lynch were hilarious and Teddy Geiger hit that perfect note as an angsty teenager with Emma as the adorable, sterotypical good girl trying to be bad.

B002KR7NTC|5.0|Ask any Frenchman what his favourite film is, and chances are this one will come out on top. The film came out in 1966 and it held the French box-office record until Dany Boon's 'Les Ch'tis' in 2008! It stars two of the country's best-loved comic actors, Louis de Funès and Bourvil, in a WW2 comedy also featuring the talents of Terry-Thomas. The original title \\"La Grande Vadrouille\\" is difficult to render but refers to the mad dash across occupied France. In 1942, an RAF plane is shot down over Paris and the three airmen parachute to safety: one lands on Bourvil's painter's scaffolding, another on the roof of the Opera house where the orchestra (led by de Funès) is rehearsing and Terry-Thomas ends up in the seal's bathing pond at the zoo. Our two heroes somewhat reluctantly join forces to take them under their wing(s) and thwart the occupying German police's efforts to capture them before they can escape to the 'free zone'.    The comic moments from this film by Gérard Oury and now firmly engraved in the French people's subconscious are too numerous to mention. Watch it in French with subtitles rather than a dubbed version - there's a fair amount of English in it anyway. You'll find yourself whistling 'Tea for Two' the next time you visit the Turkish baths, that's for sure! It's hard to believe that this film is practically unknown in Britain and America. Don't neglect it any longer. If you like it, give \\"Le Corniaud\\" a try as well - by the same director and with the same two stars - the scene of the crash with a 2CV at the beginning is THE classic comedy moment in French cinema!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I bought 2 of these as birthday presents for my daughter and step-mother whom declare \\"Dirty Dancing\\" as their all time favorite film.  They love all the extras this edition offers and it comes in such an eye catching package.      As usual, Amazon is top notch from ordering to delivery.
0670022411|4.0|I liked the book but I'm sorry when someone reads a 500 page book, they are expecting a full story and not a nice volume one!  Had I known that this book was an elaborate setup for the next book then I may have passed on it.  There was some creative elements that I really enjoyed but seriously hasn't the cold vampire always tempted by the siren story been told.    I stuck with it and did find some fun things but it was a bit more work than I had anticipated.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|So when my boyfriend's mom said she had bought this movie, I was really excited. I love Johnny Depp, and really admire his work. I decided to ignore what Entertainment Weekly had written about this movie (big mistake!)<br /><br />Both the beginning and the end were intriuging, but for most the movie, it seemed that the script could not make up its' mind. Was it a Bond-esque action thriller or something more suave and slow paced? The result was a ten mile per hour boat chase and a lot of meals and something about a ball. Far from being a thriller, the plot and action was so incredibly boring, I fell asleep. The scenery was beautiful and some of the dialouge was fairly witty, but it was lost in the struggle to pay attention to this movie.<br /><br />This movie would have been a lot more sucessful if it had decided what it wanted to be. I adore slow-paced thrillers, but this was a snooze-fest.<br /><br />Johnny, look. I love you, man. But you cannot do what your buddy Nick Cage does, and just take any old movie for the hell of it. Yeah you got to be in Italy for a summer, but was it worth becoming the laughingstock of Hollywood?

B000AOEMXM|5.0|I was a bit put off by the price for this complete series, but I was pleased with the quality overall. The packaging is over the top with the fancy boxes, and the special features content is excellent. The outtakes are hilarious! Enterprise was a wonderful installment to the Star Trek saga and the cast is fantastic. The acting was superb. Pity Paramount did not let the actors evolve the characters further by cancelling the show. You really see this development by the third season. Having all four seasons at your fingertips in one complete set is great, because you get hooked on watching each episode as it leads into the next. Season three is the best. I was not happy with the awful way they ended this series, but that is just my opinion. I guess killing off the most talented actors character in a series is typical! Despite what others may say about Enterprise, I think you will enjoy the dynamics of this great cast. They put their heart into this and it shows. Too bad they can't bring the cast back for another go'round!
B000W4E3OS|5.0|Being new to Scriabin, it was interesting to notice how entirely idiosyncratic his pieces are, though part of the romantic tradition they could not be mistaken for any other composer's works (including Chopin whom i thought to be closest), their shade is unmistakably their own.  There is present a ceaseless nervous searching and meandering that is unique and meaningful.<br /><br />Having nothing to compare these to, i don't hesitate to say that Lettberg's playing is comprehending and proficient - even though, i must admit, the cover-picture had made me wary and apprehensive!  Always extremely dynamic, almost without structure like the path of a cat.  And sensitive also, like a cat.  Exhilarating and draining to listen to.<br /><br />The other reviewers have given this four stars only, and they may be right, seeing that they seem to be more knowledgeable and experienced than i, but from my personal experience five stars is the only grade that makes sense.<br /><br />(This review pertains to the sonatas and a couple of random pieces, as i haven't yet listened to nearly everything included, but really i can not even imagine further listening would change anything.)

1878424114|4.0|I like the feel of this book. I mean the actual texture and size of it. This is the kind of book that sits on my cocktail table.<br /><br />But I do have more serious things to say. I confess that I've never been successful at attempts to meditate, which left me feeling that maybe I couldn't accomplish any of the rest of it. Reading on, however, I found myself thinking two sort of contradictory thoughts. (1) I've been there, done and do this. (2) I think for anyone to get the full measure out of this presentation it should follow thorough reading of his other works (which, I confess, I haven't done.)<br /><br />As for point number one, my major occupation for many years was in teaching psychology, primarily theories of personality and social psych. Reading this, I felt like I was right back home with Abe Maslow and, even more, Karl Jung, with \\"Self\\" even spelled with a capital \\"S.\\"  I'm happy being there. I liked the book and its guidance.<br /><br />The book is full of so many things I'd like to quote. I'll settle for this on page 11. \\"When we experience the power of the Self, there is an absence of fear; there is no compulsion to control; and no struggle for approval or external power.\\" Which leads me to my next point.<br /><br />Compelling for me is the resonance with my other career, individual psychotherapy. The content reflects my goals for me and for my clients, and our frequent successes in working toward them. Actually, it won't sit on my cocktail table, but rather in my window seat where I keep materials I lend out when it seems appropriate. Or maybe it should go to my daughter who has found her Self in yoga.<br /><br />I'd like to propose this as a work to be studied in my discussion group of six rather non-traditional Lutheran women striving to understand our individual faith journeys. I know we'd have a ball with it. I don't think the church would erupt in fiery explosion if we were to focus on this Buddhist based work, and it lends itself so beautifully to \\"working through.\\"<br /><br />I'm holding back on the fifth star only because I think the book needs previous experience on the part of the reader to get the full measure from it.g back on the fifth star only because I think the book needs previous experience on the part of the reader to get the full measure from it.
0316017922|5.0|Dear Mr. Gladwell,    I am a high school student and for an assignment our class was required to read your book and apply it to our essential questions. These essential questions are, \\"How does time and place affect who a person is?\\" In your book you address what make one successful, or an outlier. You say that success is not derived from simply the deeds of one person, but it is derived from the people around them and the opportunities they are presented with. This coincides with our essential question. Time and place are the basis of opportunity, and for most of the stories, time was a large factor in the origins of their success. You also presented place as being key when addressing success. In other cases place was the most important factor in whether or not someone was successful.    While reading your novel, although I enjoyed all chapters and their ability to show stories of success, I really connected to chapters three and four in addition to the epilogue. In chapter 3 you reference the real problem with genius' and their success. Within the chapter you say that even the smartest of people are not necessarily successful, and I totally agree with that concept. Time and place are KEY to success and that even the most \\"gifted\\" of people cannot go anywhere in life without others and opportunity. A question I still had after the reading was, how much would you say that natural gifts do affect success? In chapter four you continue with your topic of the flawed idea of genius and the false idea of instant success. You brought up the idea of psychological development and socioeconomic status as very important in success as opposed to raw talent, in this case intelligence. I found this chapter very interesting and I agree with it on the basis that I study psychology and I can definitely see the correlation. A question I had after the reading was, is this idea found cross culturally or is just an American thing? Finally, I loved the epilogue. This helped wrap up the entire novel with a short conclusion, and I agreed with all of your point s in it as well. You finished the book with the story of your ancestors and how you derived your success from them. This was a great way to end the book, and add your own experiences to strengthen your argument. My question after this chapter is, is the perception of success vital in seeing where your's originates?   Finally, I would like to finish by apply this novel to my own life. During the whole novel you describe what really makes success as opposed from what people believe. One of those concepts was time and how practice and experience makes success. I can see this idea clearly in my life. A close friend of mine came down with Lyme disease when he was in his early teens and was bed ridden for several months. During this time he had time to research and work on computers and learn more about them. By the time he was better he was leaps and bounds above everyone else in his field because he had the opportunity to practice. This book opened my eyes passed our society's preconceived notions about success and how it is really derived. This realization will not only help me understand the success of others, but also how to create success for myself.  ~A. Channing

B004P02OJ6|3.0|I came into the movie thinking that it was going to be about one thing but it turned out to be slightly different. The previews seem to indicate that this was a movie about a man (Russel Crowe) who breaks his wife out of jail after she committed a horrible crime.  Without giving away the details of the movie to all of you potential viewers that is not exactly how it goes down. Yes Crowe helps his wife escape but it is not exactly a jail-break scenario.  I thought the movie was ok but not great. There was definitely a fair bit of action that kept me entranced and made the flight go much faster but overall the plot was dull, it was fairly predictable, and in the end you really were not sure if she did or did not do it.

So, I am especially critical when it comes to books about vampires and witches.      As I usually do when taking on stories in this genre, I approached this book with trepidation and hoped only that I wouldn't be bored.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself deeply immersed in a fast-paced, smartly written story with literary and historical references and a sizzling romance!     I can't wait for the sequel!

0545140323|5.0|When Penny Lane Bloom's heart is broken by the one person she never suspected, she swears off guys ... forever. Or at least until she's out of high school, which ever comes first. Enter The Lonely Hearts Club - a club that focuses more on strengthening the bonds between friends than strengthening relationships with the opposite sex.    Penny Lane doesn't set out to make a statement, instead she sets out to find out who she really is, and to make the most of her remaining time in high school. But when the word of The Lonely Heart Club spreads, she has more club members than her basement could fit, a statement is exactly what she makes.    But when romantic sparks start to flare between Penny Lane and a friend, will it mean the end of The Lonely Hearts Club, or will it mean the end of the Penny Lane we've all come to know and love?    Elizabeth Eulberg's debut novel is unforgettable. Its full of honest emotions, laugh out loud moments, and most of all a lot of heart. The Lonely Hearts Club is extremely well written, and is full of characters that are insightful, smart, and one of a kind. Readers will be able to identify and sympathize with Penny Lane and her fellow Lonely Hearts Club members.    It's a real girl powered read, and one that any music fan - especially a Beatles fan - could really appreciate!

Cassandra soon begins a search for her grandmother's history as well as Cassandra's own.  Along the way, Cassandra will deal with demons that haunt her as well as the demons that have haunted her grandmother, Nell, all her life.    In 1913, Nell was found on a wharf in Australia by a kind and gentle wharf master.  He brings her home to his wife who wants children badly but has been unable to conceive.  On the eve of her 21st birthday, her father reveals to Nell that she is adopted and tells her what little he knows of her background.  He gives Nell a small suitcase that she was carrying when he found her on the wharf.    With the contents of the suitcase, Nell begins the search for her past but is waylaid in her search when, Cassandra, at the age of 11 is brought to her, by her n'er do well mother and Nell raises Cassandra.    Kate Morton has written a fairy tale of sorts with this novel.  In fact, one of the protaganists in the story is Eliza, who writes fairy tales and \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is an adult fairy tale with undercurrents of darkness.  The story starts in the early 1900's in London when Eliza's aristocratic mother runs away with a sailor and leaves her children to fend for themselves in a tenement in London and the story moves to present day, England on the Cornish coast where Eliza lived in a small cottage with a forgotten garden.    Kate Morton writes a mesmerizing story that parallels the dark fairy tales that Eliza writes in her Cornish cottage by the sea.  There are some elements of surprise here although you will probably figure some of the secrets out before the ending.  This is well worth reading as are all of Kate Morton's novels.

031603438X|5.0|I'm old enough to remember the premiere of the first Rolling Stones single 'Come On' on Radio Luxembourg, and soon thereafter the incredible Diddleyesque remake of Buddy Holly's 'Not Fade Away', their second British 45.    I didn't expect much from this memoir, having noted the name of a ghostwriter associated with the book.   There is nothing worse than ghostwritten autobiographies of celebrities, who, it often seems, never even read the books they allegedly authored.  (Check out Roman Polanski's as an example of an artificial author voice.)  But, heck, I had to read Keef's just as I had to read Dylan's, which also at times betrays the voice of an uncredited ghostwriter or editor.  And here comes a surprise - \\"LIFE\\" is unmistakably Keith Richard's voice, as I know it from the many interviews I have read with him over the years.    I don't know what I can add to the reviews already published. Let me say that the book brought me to tears, and I was sorry to see it end.  Read it and you'll feel Keith's pain and his joy and his frustrations with Bill, Mick and earlier Brian.  Also, read the recent review in the New York Review of Books. The book is as good as the author of the review thinks.    [...]    I strongly suspect that Keith and his co-writer James Fox have read the classic memoir of   François-René de Chateaubriand \\"Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe\\"  (\\"Memoirs from Beyond the Grave\\") which has long been considered the gold standard of literary  memoirs.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|Sucker Punch has such an extraordinary trailer that there ought to be an Oscar category for trailers, just to reward it. That may be the only recognition the film ever gets, because no full length feature film in history could live up to that kind promise, just in terms of sheer bombast. And, judging by the initial critical reaction, nor has this one got a Babydoll's chance in a House for the Mentally Insane of getting any industry recognition: it's going down like a burning zeppelin with the critics. A \\"crass women's penitentiary picture reconceived for today's manga- and vidgame-savvy crowd\\" says one (presumably not manga- and \\"vidgame\\" savvy) critic; \\"built so as to dispense with the need for narrative logic\\" says another. A pity, because I think the critics are wildly wrong here. With any luck the public will have a different view, because Sucker Punch almost lives up to its trailer.<br /><br />It could be the greatest fantasy motion picture since [[ASIN:B00004R80K The Matrix]]. It could also be the greatest disaster since The Hindenburg. In either case the ringside seat is a scorcher.<br /><br />Let's see, then.<br /><br />In fairness, the film does miss a couple of the trailer's features: There's no Led Zeppelin on the soundtrack, for one thing. Nonetheless, Zack Snyder uses every trick in the book. It's beautifully shot. Every frame is a gem. The technology - there's more green screen here than in [[ASIN:B0006L7OB6 Sky Captain & The World Of Tomorrow]]- is sympathetic, clever and impressive. It's artistic. It oozes style. It is in glorious two dimensions.<br /><br />There's a little preamble which winds up in an all-girl asylum before things descend impossibly into a psychotic imaginarium of kick-ass ninja dolls, samurai, monster robots, fire-breathing dragons, sepia-tinted Nazi zeppelins and crash-&-burning bi-planes: yea: all of the above. Amongst it all, statuesque, like a serene core at the eye of the storm is super-cool Scott Glenn, a multiple personality avatar dispensing one-line platitudes to his jailbait harem as if the structural integrity of universe required it. He intones Alexander Hamilton's aphorism: \\"Stand for something, or you'll fall for anything\\".<br /><br />Sucker Punch, indeed, stands for everything. Anything, even. So much does it play like a seventeen-year-old's wet dream that it is tempting to write it off as one.<br /><br />It would appear many critics have been duly tempted. Their major complaints: Lack of wit. No plot. Wafer-thin characters. Gratuitous girlitude. The last two, sure - but, come on: the context is comic book bravura. What did you expect: [[ASIN:B00004D04C Kurosawa]]? Yes, parts of it are like stages of a video game, they are meant to be. Sucker Punch borrows from The Matrix, but repays with interest.<br /><br />But lack of wit? This is a brilliantly funny picture. And no plot? Au contraire: that's a different story. In their haste to write this off, I fear the critics have forgotten to pay attention. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury: before you bemoan a lack of intellectual endeavour, use some of your own: at least have a go at trying to puzzle things out. And there are some puzzles, if you only look for them: narrative peculiarities which Snyder has gone to some lengths to achieve. It's only fair to suppose he did this for a reason.<br /><br />Firstly, the opening scene: pay attention. We open in a vaudeville theatre. The velvet curtains open on a set that is a young girl's bedroom. We see a blonde girl sitting on her bed with her back to us. Take note: This is a theatrical set of some description. It's a play. It's not real. The camera tracks in and around the girl on the bed, and as it does so the set resolves into an actual house. Then we see the girl's face. It is Babydoll (Emily Browning). Note how we are introduced to Babydoll: on a stage. It is important.<br /><br />Babydoll's mother is dead. An Evil Stepfather circles like a vulture. He tries to have his way with Babydoll. She resists. He locks the door, and turns to Babydoll's little sister. Babydoll tries to intervene, but little sister winds up dead. Again, remember this. Look out for parallels with other characters later in the movie.<br /><br />Babydoll is framed for her sister's murder and corruptly declared insane. She is institutionalised and maliciously scheduled for a quick lobotomy. Again, note how this happens: To a reworking of Eurhythmics' [[ASIN:B001GU516G Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)]], a Black Maria rolls up the hill to \\"Lennox House\\", an institution \\"FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE\\" - or just of sweet dreams? Warders and orderlies leer. Babydoll is given a tour. She winds up in a common room full of crazies called \\"the theatre\\". At this point there is a sudden and jarring transition from Asylum to Bordello. Suddenly we are in a Burlesque Club of some sort - where did the Asylum go? We meet a showgirl Sweetpea, during a rehearsal.

Look out for parallels with other characters later in the movie.    Babydoll is framed for her sister's murder and corruptly declared insane. She is institutionalised and maliciously scheduled for a quick lobotomy. Again, note how this happens: To a reworking of Eurhythmics' [[ASIN:B001GU516G Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)]], a Black Maria rolls up the hill to \\"Lennox House\\", an institution \\"FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE\\" - or just of sweet dreams? Warders and orderlies leer. Babydoll is given a tour. She winds up in a common room full of crazies called \\"the theatre\\". At this point there is a sudden and jarring transition from Asylum to Bordello. Suddenly we are in a Burlesque Club of some sort - where did the Asylum go? We meet a showgirl Sweetpea, during a rehearsal. She breaks off, mid scene, aghast at the notion that the production should contemplate her character, an orphan, being sent to an asylum for a lobotomy. Again, note this scene.

0375842209|3.0|Told from Death's point-of-view- this is the story of Liesel Meminger who was taken to live in Germany with a foster family during World War II.  She unwittingly steals her first book at the graveside of her younger brother.  A book which she uses to lull herself to sleep after experiencing nightmares of her brother's death.  Across the years, Liesel collects numerous stolen books as she learns to survive despite a less-than-ideal circumstance.<br /><br />I had a hard time getting into this book.  I know it has numerous rave reviews, however I found it a bit dry.  I think others would appreciate the book more than I did, and I can see teenagers enjoying this story told from Death's perspective.

B004G6009U|4.0|Disney's 50th Animated feature is entertaining and plays well even on a standard dep TV.<br /><br /> Tangled is the 50th full-length animated FEATURE film from Disney and they are using that number to promote the film and its new DVD release. It's \\"interesting\\" that the DELUXE FOUR-DVD set (DVD+ Digital+Blu-ray+ Blu-ray 3D) is priced at $49.99 and not an even $50.<br /><br />Anyway, there are MANY reviews already posted based on the theatrical version of the film so I won't re-hash the plot here. You probably will be more interested in the home version of the film.<br /><br />As noted above, there is the 4-disc Deluxe version, but Disney has also released a 2-discv version without the 3-D disc, and a single-disc DVD version. Unless you are one of the few with a 3D TV the Deluxe version probably won't be of much use.<br /><br />To date I still haven't gone Blu-ray so I was unable to watch the bonus features exclusive to BR, which include A \\"Making of\\", Deleted scenes and two extended songs. The other two minor bonuses are on the standard DVD version. These are two interesting \\"original storybook openings\\" - running just over 3 minutes each - and a two-minute \\"countdown\\" compilation of the 50 animated features - to a soundtrack of Stevie Nicks' \\"Dreams\\" - with no identification of each film.<br /><br />I've watched the film on my standard large screen TV and its really sharp. The computer animation gets better and better. And the sound on the standard DVD was perfect too!<br /><br />As for the film itself, I liked it though I don't think its Disney's best. The songs by Alan Menken sound more like they were written for a Broadway show then for the films he previously composed for.<br /><br />So, yes I enjoyed it. And would recommend. I just wish that Disney would provide those people with standard DVD players some of the bounues that is only on the BR disc. After all,  many of these do not use the BD component.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this while drunk one night and didn't remember I did so until I checked my e-mail the next morning. I also shipped it to a city four hours away from where I live. Anyway, after driving down there, I got picked it up in all of its 6 lbs of glory. It looks very professional and the knobs are fun to turn. My intention was to buy something I could use to record with on my computer. Instead of an m-xobx (which I bought shortly after), I bought this, which has no USB plugin. This thing is useful for live performances, but not so much recording as you have to plug into your comp's microphone or buy a separate USB plugin. I'm not sure what to do with it other than keep it away from my family who might use it to reinforce the notion that I have a drinking problem.    I used it once. To spit dope rhymes.
0525951652|2.0|If you like stories of international political and war sagas -- punctuated by a few torrid or convenient love affairs and cultural \\"artifacts\\" you may like this book  The main characters are Russian, German, Britain and U.S, national politics.  The author wants us to get a glimpse of the political leaders of these times, their styles and their nonsensical attitudes toward war.  The author gives us general profiles and comparisons of the populations and how these interact with their governments...and also how women sometimes configure into all these male war games.  It's a lot like today.  The people in the book never \\"grab\\" me a gut level because they seem to be mere prototypes installed to bring alive social incidents, cultural differences and social change.  It could have been an interesting historical novel but it covered so much geography, subterfuge and so many predictable prototypes that I kept getting lost or disinterested.  It was like a different author had written it than Follett's other, deeply human and moving novels. It read as though two different people with different styles and intentions had written it -- one writer spewing research details about wars and rumors of wars and the other [writer] trying to get a word in edgewise about the lives of ordinary and extraordinary people during World War 1.

B004EPYZU8|1.0|I just arrived home after bolting from the theater. I usually stay for the credits but, in this instance, I was already halfway to my car before the first name appeared. My mistake was that I listened to my teenage son. He wanted to see a movie at the last minute and as we had already seen most of the other films currently in the theaters, we went to see this train wreck. Had I known how bad Sucker Punch is, I would have scheduled an appointment to get hemorrhoids lanced or offer to clean the theater's bathroom floors with my tongue as both of those options would have been FAR more pleasant than having to suffer through this movie.    There is NOTHING positive I can possibly say about this cinematic nightmare. Horrible acting, NOTHING worth watching - it's a visual nightmare. Asinine script, insipid story. My ears were bleeding from the \\"music\\" that blared throughout.  Heck, the movie would have been improved, immensely, if Rebecca Black had been selected to sing the title song! LOL!    SPOILER ALERT!    The best part of the movie occurred at the end when a lobotomy is performed - it's just too bad that free lobotomies weren't offered to movie patrons as we battled to see who could run out of the theater first. I suspect that a lobotomy might be the only cure to ensure that this nightmare has been completely erased from one's gray-matter!    Run, don't walk from anyone who suggests that Sucker Punch has any value - it has NONE. Sucker Punch is a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.
B0001NBMEE|2.0|This adaptation of Harold Foster's fine comic strip is quite disappointing.  While the film has high production values -- good costumes and sets and some engaging action -- the story is slow (and departs annoyingly and unnecessarily from the strip) and the actors preposterous.  Robert Wagner is especially miscast in the lead role.  He spends most of the movie scowling, or looking confused.  Sterling Hayden is an amusingly odd choice for Gawaine: an Arthurian hero via the wild west.  I can't recommend this to any but the most die-hard swashbuckler aficionado.

0307593495|5.0|Kurt Wallander has become one of the iconic figures of crime fiction, pretty much defining the Scandinavian flavor of the genre, and fans of Henning Mankell's dour, dogged, beleaguered and very human detective (like me) finally have the new novel they've been waiting for. Unfortunately, it will be the last. Our hero is really feeling his age, and has begun forgetting some basic protocols...like not keeping tabs on his service revolver...which lands him in hot water. He's also become a grandfather, and it is his daughter  Linda's significant other, or rather his parents, who are the source of the mystery at the center of The Troubled Man.     The ambiguous title ostensibly refers to Hakan von Enke, Linda's future father-in-law and a retired submarine captain, although it clearly refers to Wallander as well. Von Enke goes missing shortly after his 75th birthday party, and no one--not even his wife--has a clue what might have happened to him. After she suddenly vanishes as well, Wallander turns up evidence that they have some been hiding some secrets not even their only son, Hans, suspects.      Fortunately, Wallander hasn't lost his edge, even as he struggles against his own fear of death and his physical decline, and he follows the usual convoluted trail to solve the case in the last few pages. There are no surprises here, at least as far as the players, Wallander's MO and Mankell's formula for these books, but that's okay. It's a formula that works, and Wallander is a character whose three-dimensional predictability is part of his charm. There are references to earlier books in the series and to the characters who starred in them, all of which makes it clear that Mankell is wrapping most things up before cutting his fans loose. As a result, this is a darker book than most of its predecessors (but not as dark as some of Mankell's other books, like Depths, which I couldn't finish).      Nonetheless, as a fan of Wallander and Mankell, I devoured the book because no onedoes Scandinavian crime fiction better. At times I had to look back to earlier chapters to keep track of the various characters and their roles, and there were a few plot elements that stretched credibility--especially Wallander's former schoolmate who just happened to have amassed a definitive archive of Swedish naval memorabilia, photos and documents--but I willingly suspended disbelief, and it didn't impinge on my enjoyment of the book.     When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tired of Sherlock Holmes, he killed him off, until his fans' outcry forced him to resurrect his hero. The way Mankell leaves things, it's pretty clear Kurt Wallander won't be reemerging, but he's left us with an enormously satisfying finale to Kurt's distinguished (if fictional) career.

B004A8ZWTW|5.0|Even though many have seen at least one or two film adaptations of Bronte's blockbuster gothic romance novel...there is still plenty of good reason to see this version.  I think that Mia Wasikowska's acting is pitch-perfect - maybe even the definitive characterization of this fascinating woman. She knows that she has been unlucky, but is intelligently waiting, watching, and analyzing everyone before she makes her next move.    The time and place - England's North country mid -nineteenth century.  Jane is unloved by her aunt, and after a fight with her cousin is shipped off - rather brutally - to a boarding school run by a self-important and cruel headmaster.  She develops one friendship there - a girl called Helen - but loses Helen to an illness.      The beginning of the altercation between Jane and her male cousin is nerve shattering as he bashes her head into a wall, and she (deservedly) hits him back. Of course - the aunt sees and hears only wants she wants to observe...and Jane is conveniently eliminated from the family.     During the prison like experience in Lowood School,  Jane becomes \\"educated\\" to serve the elite. After some mysterious circumstances, she secures a job as governess of a female ward of Sir Edward Rochester.  He and she develop an uneasy friendship at first - which ultimately blooms into love...as both have had very difficult pasts and need to repair their souls.  I enjoyed Jane's character telling the truth in a polite way when she tells Mr. Rochester at one point he speaks nonsense.    If I could offer one small critique - the early history of Jane Eyre is skipped over rather quickly. The meanness of the boarding school (Lowood School) is rather underplayed...and the necessary friendship with Helen is just a glimpse.  It is when Jane Eyre comes to Edward Rochester's manor house titled Thornfield Hall, that Mia Wasikowska shows her passion and thoughtfulness.  She is remarkable in showing just the right amount of wilfulness and submissiveness as an employee of Mr. Rochester - and just the right amount of beauty and plainness.   There are moments when the true yearning for intimacy of Jane Eyre is glimpsed - as, for example, when she secretly studies one of the erotic paintings of Edward Rochester at night by candlelight.     The cinematography is appropriately gloomy for the mood of the picture.  In summary, this is a very worthy adaptation of an important work of English literature. And for those interested  - the Penguin Illustrated Classics did a splendid job on an \\"Illustrated Jane Eyre.\\"
B004JAUCQE|5.0|The beloved front man of Dinosaur Jr., J Mascis, has showed his fans once again that know one knows where the wind will blow with him. That to me is a true sign of a contemporary artist. Here he is back again with an acoustic work, but this is not new. J Mascis has been playing acoustically since the mid 1990's although the rest of the world did get to see this kind of performance (that I know of) until the early 2000's. And though it may have seemed that we had seen the last of the acoustic performances after the unforeseen reunion of Dinosaur Jr.'s original members, J Mascis has decided to start off the new decade with something he's never done before - a completely acoustic album.    Several Shades of Why grows on the listen quick and resonates with the still chill of early spring as we wait for the warm weather to come. \\"Waitings what we do\\" J sings in the chorus of the intro track \\"Listen to Me\\" an endearing songs of love and pain that we carry deep inside. After that the album carries us with fast pace songs \\"Several Shades of Why\\" and \\"Not Enough\\" Then the mood slows down in only the way that J can painting the air with sounds to speak to the listener on \\"Very Nervous and in Love\\".     Things pick up for two songs on \\"Make it Right\\" and \\"Where are you\\" - My personal favorite. J seems to be going hippie country on us on that one and I love it! The pace slows down in mood on \\"Too Deep\\" and thickens as it closes with \\"Can I\\" and \\"What Happened\\"    I echo the sentiments of another review that I love everything that J does. I would even say that in a lot of ways I like \\"Free So Free\\" over \\"More Light\\" in a lot of ways, but that,s not what we're talking about here. We're talking about \\"Several Shades of Why\\" Its a great album if you love J Mascis' acoustic works and I really mean- its a great album!

B003G4W49C|3.0|I chose to read this book due to the thousands of 5 star reviews.  I like the majority of the book, but when it got toward the end of the middle and end of the book, the pace seemed to quicken too much.  I like fast paced books, but near the end, everything was closed out in a matter of one chapter mostly.  I like quick reads, but it seemed like the author ran out of ideas and just came up with a bunch of stuff to end all of the stories taking place.    I did not like the political aspects of this book, with Valentine and Peter.  I thought that the characters they made up on the Net were useless and just added in to make the book longer.  The author should have come up with something better to fill the gaps......that's what I felt the story line was.....a gap filler.      Overall, I give this book 3 stars because it was good at first, but then just got plain odd and because of the political story in the book, which was, for a lack of a better word.....lame!!!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I was a bit skeptical despite the reviews that I would find this book by a Swedish writer interesting and boy was I glad to be totally wrong.<br />The first few chapters were kind of slow but once the story picked up I couldn't put the book down and I dropped all my weekend plans until I had read the last page. The graphic violence against women in a modern society like Sweden seems hard to believe but I trust the author had done his research and there is some truth there. Will definitely be looking forward to reading the sequels.

0316017922|4.0|Dear Mr. Gladwell,   The book, Outliers, was one of the more interesting books that I have read for school. My teacher chose Outliers as a class reading because it tied in well with the essential question of the English course - \\"to what extent does time and place define a person.\\" Before reading this book, I agreed that time and place could influence one's life but, I never thought that it would have such a drastic effect on one's success.    In the Matthew Effect, you talked about how our birthdays could influence our success in life. I found it interesting that the best hockey players are almost all born in the winter. You explained that the reason to this could be because the cut-off date is December 31st. An athlete born right after the cut-off date will have an advantage because they might be bigger, faster and stronger than an athlete born several months after the cut-off date. This advantage grows because the child gets more attention and coaching because they are viewed to have the better shot at being a professional. I have friends that play hockey, but are not born in the winter. I have some bad news for them.   Another chapter I found interesting was The 10,000 Hour Rule. I found it fascinating that many successful people, such as the Beatles and Bill Gates, had at least 10,000 hours of experience in their field. I agree that people must practice, practice and practice to become a professional, but you must also have the dedication and work ethic to succeed. A question I have is can people that are naturally gifted in their expertise become an outlier in less than 10,000 hours?   In Part II of The Trouble with Geniuses, you told the story of Christopher Langan and Robert Oppenheimer. I was surprised to read that such an intelligent man like Langan could have such a disappointing future. In Outliers, you mentioned that practical intelligence is \\"a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills are from our families\\" (Gladwell 102). I found it very interesting that the most important factor in one's success is the environment one was raised in and not the level of analytical intelligence or IQ one possesses. It is something that is out of one's control, yet it still has such a dramatic effect. You wrote also that Oppenheimer had an advantage over Langan because \\"Oppenheimer was raised in one the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan,\\" (108) while Langan was not. I did not necessarily agree with this idea because there are many success stories today of how one overcame poverty and became successful. I do not think wealth is a requirement for one to become successful, although it can help. Sometimes I even think wealth can be a disadvantage for the child. In my opinion a parent of the upper class has a better chance of spoiling the kid than a parent of the lower class does, which I believe can be detrimental to one's path to success.    Overall, I believe you answered the essential question really well in this chapter and all your ideas were very well explained. The book really gives you a new perspective on how every little thing can control one's success. It is really interesting it was a pleasure reading Outliers.  From,  Justin Choi

B000F3T7X8|4.0|With a sleek, sultry sound cleverly derived from the early Roxy Music, though here even more simmering, Japan reached a creative peak with Gentlemen Take Polaroids. Its affect is almost siren-like, beckoning the listener to descend into whirlpools of serpentine fretless bass, dreamy, evocative synthesizers, and thumping ethnic-influenced drums (both acoustic and electronic). Throw in a penchant for oriental scales, de rigeur vocal histrionics, general arty pretentiousness, and superior production values, and you've got one of the most potent mixtures ever concocted during the post-punk era, albeit with questionable taste in make-up and men's fashions. The highlights are the title track, \\"Taking Islands in Africa,\\" \\"Methods of Dance,\\" and the chic, angst-ridden New Romantic ballad \\"Nightporter.\\"
0393325172|5.0|This is being advertised as a \\"Movie Tie-In Edition\\", but the only relation between the film 'Master and Commander' and Mr. O'Brian's book is hidden in the infertile imaginations of Hollywood producers. Having recently re-read 'Master and Commander', I thought it would be entertaining to watch the film of the same name, and did so. Hollywood's version merely lifts snippets of ongoing plot lines from many of the Aubrey/Maturin series and inserts them into the film randomly without any apparent attempt at thematic connection.<br /><br />In fact, the film's subtitle -'The Far Side of the World'- is taken from the 10th of the Aubrey/Maturin series, where the plot concerns the pursuit of an American frigate by a British one around the Horn and into the Pacific during the American War of 1812 (the book's plot itself being loosely based on the pursuit of the USS Essex). But because a losing battle fought by an American ship against a British one wouldn't play well to American audiences, a French frigate is substituted as the enemy.<br /><br />So, by all means read O'Brian's 'Master and Commander'... it's an excellent story excellently written, but expect to be confused by any effort to \\"tie in\\" the book with the film. \\"Never judge a book by its movie\\".

B0040JHWKS|3.0|I've been a big Springsteen fan since Born To Run, and was one of those anxiously awaiting it's long delayed follow-up.  When Darkness On The Edge Of Town finally came out I was disappointed, though it has grown on me over the years and I now think it is one of his better albums.  When I heard about The Promise, I was excited about the prospect of the true successor to Born To Run finally emerging.  What a disappointment.  With a few exceptions, the songs just pale in comparison to his previous (and subsequent) work.        The version of Racing In The Street, with a great Phil Specter like production, wouldn't have sounded out of place on Born To Run, though the stripped down version fit the tone of Darkness better.  Breakaway and The Promise are terrific, evocative songs, classic Springsteen.  The two made famous in cover versions, Because The Night and Fire, are good songs, but on no other Springsteen album would they be standouts.  Candy's Boy is pretty good, but not as good as Candy's Room, which it actually bears little resemblance to, other than the same opening lines (sung, not spoken).  Most of the remainder on the two disc set sound like they could have been written by any of a million  hacks of limited talent.  Look at some of the the lyrics:      \\"Hey girl, won't you come out tonight       Girl, where the stars are shining bright       You've gotta get that feeling       We gotta get that feeling       Back again, yea back again\\"              or      \\"And you complain about the clothes I wear       And you explain, there's other boys out there       You complain my car makes too much noise       And you cry I'm always out with the boys\\"     Sure, some lyrics don't hold up as well without the music, but try the same with any of the songs on Born To Run and tell me it's not like night and day.       It's hard for me to understand some of the rave reviews given here.  It seems like some people feel if you're a fan of a performer that criticizing any oftheir work is blasphemy (and cause for a negative rating of the review), but in my mind, giving this collection five stars is an insult to his many other works that truly deserve it.       The boss writes in the liner notes that he felt pressure to prove he wasn't a \\"flash in the pan\\", but I have to wonder whether his career would have been the same had he released this as the follow-up to Born To Run.  It gives me a new appreciation for the excellent job done in deciding which songs to include on Darkness.  Oh, there is one thing I do like better about The Promise than Darkness--the black and white cover photo of a pensive Bruce leaning against an old Ford under an ominously dark sky is way cool.

B002RKRUEA|2.0|(Just to be clear, the Meditations is a five-star book. My two-star rating applies only to this Kindle edition.)    Marcus Aurelius, emperor of Rome, may be the closest mankind has ever come to producing the philosopher king that Plato envisioned in The Republic. A reluctant ruler and a reluctant warrior, much of his reign was spent in battle, defending the frontiers of the empire from the \\"barbarian\\" hordes. Fortunately for us, he carried a notebook along on his military campaigns, and thus we have the Meditations. Marcus's writings reveal him to be the last and greatest of the classical Stoics. Stoicism is a school of thought that asserts we have no control over our lives, only control over our perceptions. It advocates that the best life is the life that is lived in accordance with nature (not \\"nature\\" as in grass and trees, but \\"nature\\" as in the order of the universe). By concentrating one's thoughts and choices on what is good and virtuous, and disregarding the unimportant distractions of everyday life (even life and death are said to be neither good nor bad, but \\"indifferent\\"), we can avoid negative emotions like fear, anger, grief, and frustration, and live a life of happiness and tranquility. That's an oversimplification, of course. If you really want to know what Stoicism is and how it works read Epictetus or Seneca. What Marcus provides us with are the reflections of a man who studied and lived the Stoic life, and was its ultimate exemplar. Even if you don't buy into Stoicism, or have no interest in Philosophy with a capital P, you can still find inspiration and solace in the Meditations, as Marcus instructs us in dealing justly with others, overcoming emotional hardship, living life to the fullest by overcoming the fear of death, and resigning oneself to the insignificance of man in the universe.    The Meditations are divided into twelve books. Each book contains anywhere from 16 to 75 numbered paragraphs, ranging in length from a sentence to a page. The paragraphs are arranged without regard to sequence or subject matter. This haphazard method of compilation is really the book's only flaw. What the Meditations has always needed is a good index, but I've never found a volume that has one.    The Kindle edition that's offered for free on Amazon, which is the same as the one downloadable from Project Gutenberg, contains one major flaw. There is an interactive table of contents which allows you to click on the twelve books; that's fine. Following that, however, there is another clickable table of contents that lists the first line of every paragraph in the Meditations. That's a wonderful idea, in theory, but in practice it's a major pain. This extended table of contents is written as one long page of links, so it takes forever to load. You spend minutes staring at a blank screen waiting for the type to show up, then minutes more until you can actually move your cursor. Sometimes the screen saver kicks in before you even get to that point. I wish someone would go into the file and break that table up into twelve separate pages so it might actually be useful. In this edition there are no notes to the text, other than a few translator's notes. Unless you know a heck of a lot about ancient Rome and Stoicism, notes are pretty necessary for a book like this. There's a small glossary of proper names, and an appendix of correspondence between Marcus and his teacher Fronto. I like having a portable copy of the Meditations on my Kindle, but this is one case where the e-book is no substitute for a paper edition.
1589944607|5.0|Every person that I've played this game with has loved it after their first play.<br /><br />This is one of those board games that you have to convince people to try.  It looks complicated, but you will understand all of it once you've played it half way (or a lot of explanation ahead of time).  You don't have to watch or like the show to love this game.<br /><br />Humanity has practically been completely destroyed by the evil Cylons, a race of machines that we built.  The only humans left are on an old Battlestar named the Galactica.  Resources are slim, people have little hope, and there's no safe haven anywhere to refuel.  To make matters worse, Cylons have recently discovered a way to look just like humans.  At least one of you is a traitor Cylon out to make sure humanity is extinct for good.<br /><br />The Galactica is constantly under siege from Cylon Basestars and fighters.  There are constant crises that must be avoided.  Everyone puts in cards to make sure nothing terrible happens during a crisis...except the Cylon traitor.  No one knows who put in what card.  Soon every player is accusing everyone else that they must be a Cylon!<br /><br />Not only that, but half-way through the game, you may come to find out that you were a sleeper Cylon the whole time.  You only thought you were human.<br /><br />This game has lots of interaction, lots of yelling accusations, and lots of fun.  You have to try this game.
1933492953|5.0|I teach Graphic Novel Writing, and I the biggest hurdle I have is getting students who are not visual artists to understand framing, lighting, camera angles and lens types (all virtual, of course).  Any number of books out there can help you write a graphic novel script, or so they say.  A graphic novel, though, begins, IMHO, with the image, the frame, the page, the choice of composition.  Most of my students don't think that way.  This book is excellent for teaching you, my students, your students, or anybody, how to think on a visual \\"shot\\" level.  Mauria's examples are lucid, easy to understand, and offer inspiration to anyone trying to create a compelling visual story, be it film (live or animation) or graphic novel.
0061726826|5.0|This book was suggested to me from my purchase of The Hunger Games, and I was VERY glad I picked it up. The author writes absolutely beautifully; amazing descriptions and flowing sentences. You will not put it down.
1423113381|3.0|The book was received in a timely manner and in acceptable condition, however the package was shredded up so badly that we could not believe the book was still inside.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I'm not much of a reviewer, so I'll keep it short.  This was a great book to read.  As an IT professional, it really drives home the importance of doing everything you can to protect your systems, but at the same time, reminds you that no matter what, right now, we're not prepared for people with evil in their hearts.    I think this will also get non IT people to start thinking seriously about keeping their stuff up to date.  This is a good thing, even if it means more donated time to our friends and family to help them out.    It is definitely a book that is readable by everyone, and I recommend that you get your friends & family to read it.  And your boss!    This is Mark's first fiction book and it's a fantastic one.  I look forward to his next one (but having heard him interviewed on a podcast, it sounds like this one took a long time to get out the door, so I won't be holding my breath!).
B004KA9MQO|3.0|personally , I found only 3 highlights to the cd.  The rest seemed a repeat of the previous release.  She looks great and her voice is as powerful as ever.
006145785X|4.0|My review is based on my purchase of the CD.  As much as I wanted to give 5 stars for the content and insights, the reader was so subpar that I could not.    Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.    From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.      The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This was a fantastic film, and the music alone is worth seeing it for - nothing like good Gypsy jazz!

B003UAKE9Y|5.0|My 15 month toddler loves Coraline. She always watches it off the DVR at home. She is always on her best behavior when she's watching it, so I knew I had to purchase it for when we go on vacations, road trips, and for when she is visiting grandparents. We didn't really need the 3D right now but this combo DVD was cheaper than all the rest.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you like the previous Angry birds, you are going to like this one.  I think it has better graphic than the previous a-bird.      It is fun to play!
0061537969|3.0|Not sure how I feel about this one. Meh, it was just okay, and I found it very hard to stay with it. I was bored by the extensive auto racing and don't really think it should be a metaphor for all of life. As a lover of dogs, and while I think a dog narrating a book could be really fun, this was a bit serious and heavy-handed for me.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i will not be playing this game again. The game with the white bird, when you hit it. it bleeds plus it gets more injured and bleed more untik you have to kill it. this is not Angey Birds to me and NO PIGS at all!
1433502410|5.0|A very good translation and study bible.  I will probably purchase another one for a friend.   The merchandise arrived quickly and in great condition. I am pleased.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|However, they won't because they're too busy attending to more pressing matters such as watching Jersey Shore. This film will make your blood boil. If you are an average American who is unconvinced that our political system is corrupt to the core and that Wall street (as well as big oil) are the one's really in charge then you owe it to yourself to see Inside Job. The film brilliantly and clearly explains just how the financial meltdown began and how everything culminated in a massive crash that the working people of this country are still paying for. Just watch the footage of the multiple yachts and mansions owned by the very same people who caused the current recession and try not to scream.   The film is wonderfully narrated by Matt Damon and contains some of the most beautiful aerial footage of Manhattan I've ever seen. Awesome on Blu-Ray.   Truly frightening times we're living in.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Interesting how everyone has a different sense of Bruce. So all I can do is say how it hits me and then let it go.<br />I felt the first four songs are just ok. Ok is ok. I like them, but they could just be more Tracks.<br /><br />Then the album starts with a great song: What love can do. And continues on from there with song after song filled with passion for life. If you aren't an old guy, like Bruce, then you might not get Kingdom of Days; that makes me cry. Then so does the Last Carnival. The Wrestler is a classic on par with Bruce's best.<br /><br />Bruce has gone through changes, he actually has done some growing up, he shares himself and he's extremely good at doing that. So I listen and find some truth. It's great.

B000Y1CWDS|5.0|Essentially, this is just the Spider-Man 3 two-disc DVD packaged with a bonus disc, a production notebook, and packaged in decorative box. But I would be lying if I said I didn't love it. This DVD is awesome. It looks great and is a great addition to anyone looking to put something cool in their DVD collection, or Spider-Man collection. Spider-Man 3 is totally underrated and is a great deal of fun to watch! The bonus third disc is nothing special and is actually just in a cd sleeve and put inside the DVD case, but it's there for whoever is in the need to know every aspect of the movie.  Great buy for any DVD or Spider-Man fan!  If only there was gonna be a fourth and not a reboot :(
B001US29I2|3.0|It was fun putting together with my son, but before we could glue together the key joints it fell apart.  I know, I know Legos are meant to be put together and taken apart, but not my son.  He has a bucket of legos to put together however he wants, but he also has legos like this one that he enjoys leaving together and playing out the scenes of the movie with.  However he never got to enjoy playing it only putting it together.  The \\"walls\\" of the building don't attach.  They just lean-to the sides.  If you need to move it, forget about it.  Not been as enjoyable as the whole City/Police set with vehicles, Jail, etc.
0984536159|5.0|This review is for the First Volume of Mein Kampf.<br /><br />One would think that a book like Mein Kampf would need no introduction, but after carrying it around for a while, I was surprised by the comments I'd get from other people. I'd always ask such \\"critics\\" what they thought of the book and they'd reply with disgust and anger. Yet, when I asked the question, \\"Have you read it?\\" the answer was consistently, \\"Well, no but . . .\\"<br /><br />Reading something, or in this case, studying the life of the most influential person of the 20th century, should be nothing to feel embarrassed about. Understanding history helps humankind prosper and to avoid learning from historical works such as this can only slow down human progress. So, don't let the ignorant critics get to you. However, if you do read Mein Kampf, try not to do so in public places unless you want someone (who hasn't read it) to spit on your face.<br /><br />Now that we got that out of the way, we can talk about the book itself. Mein Kampf is without a doubt a sensational work. The sociopolitical situation that inspired it, the rise and fall of the Third Reich, and the dark cloud that surrounds the evil genius who authored it make it a \\"must read\\" for any thinker who wishes to find the answers to the questions WHY and HOW.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, this is an evil book. But it is still a superb document that helps us understand the conditions that paved the way for a feeble and insignificant man such as Adolf Hitler to become the strongest and most powerful man in the world.<br /><br />It is important to mention that Mein Kampf (My Struggle) was \\"dictated\\" by Adolf Hitler between 1923 and 1924 while he was in prison as a result of his participation in a failed coup. In other words, he never actually sat down to type it. That is why the entire book reads like a speech. Also, the title Hitler chose for his work was, \\"Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice,\\" but was later shortened by his publisher before its official release in 1925, well before Hitler became the man we know today.<br /><br />Through the first half of the first volume, we follow the young Adolf from his early childhood. We learn about his parents, his town, his school, his teachers, and see how his ideals began to take shape at a very early age. At this stage of the book, I was amazed by how brilliant Hitler's storytelling abilities were. His remarks were smart, his opinions well-founded, his motivations honourable, and his actions brave. Especially when considering the conditions in which he was brought up. As we learn about his early life and experiences, we get a beautiful introduction to Austria and Germany at the turn of the century. The first-person account of Hitler's early years is a very enjoyable read that will have you wonder, \\"How could something so good come from someone so evil?\\"<br /><br />Then, as we progress through his late teens and early twenties, we take a turn down political avenue. Here, we begin to see the result of his early experiences and the first manifestations of his strong ideals and his destiny to become the man we now know. We learn about the trade union movements, the rise of Marxism in Germany, and of course, the prelude and aftermath of World War I. At first, and this will be shocking to most readers, Hitler admitted to have been a defender of the Jews. That's when he saw them as a religious group, though. At that time, his real enemies were the media, the elite (which he calls \\"the bourgeoisie\\"), the Marxists, the immigrants, the leaders of the social democratic party, and the leaders of all the other parties for that matter. His views, however, began to change dramatically as he started to realize that all these groups were led by Jews, including Karl Marx himself.<br /><br />At first, he saw no racial difference between the Jews and the Aryans (as he called the \\"pure\\" Germanic races), but he was a strong nationalist ina time when all of his enemies advocated in favour of international involvement in German culture and economy. At which point, he began to ponder when looking at a German-looking Jew, \\"Is this a Jew?\\" A question which he approached by asking himself, \\"Is this . . . a German?\\"<br /><br />From then on, the book starts to go downhill humanistically, but gets quite interesting politically. As a strong nationalist, he believed that Germans were the superior race, and as such, all other races must have been inferior. He then goes on to further subdivide races and brings up evolution and natural selection as the reason the world had become plagued by disease, thieves, and poverty. He makes a strong case, though. However, his mere existence is breaks the argument that pure races are stronger by genetics (as opposed to alimentation, wealth, exercise, and education), for the simple fact that he was not physically stronger than any of his counterparts. At first, he was also against socialism. But again, inspired by others, he became a hardcore socialist and enemy of capitalism, as capitalism, in his opinion, would lead to the ruin of Germany.<br /><br />Now, what's marvellous about the bulk of the book is how well he describes the situation in Germany that led to the creation and the subsequent overwhelming popularity of Nazism (also known as National Socialism). There were some chapters were we could simply change the name of the German parties and use current counterparts and the whole conflict would have applied just as well. Also, his insight about the most effective use of propaganda is brilliant; a quality recipe still used today in many of the so-called free democratic nations of the world. Adolf Hitler, a champion of the poor, an enemy of the ruling classes, a defender against international intervention, a coupster and martyr, an incredibly charismatic leader, a gifted orator, a convincing politician, a relentless leader, a nationalist, a socialist, and a bigot who blamed all the problems of his country on them, them, and them. If he were still alive, and spoke Spanish, he would have been elected unanimously as president of any Latin American country today.<br /><br />You could feel Hitler's animosity toward the Jew in earlier sections of the book, but it wasn't any different than the animosity that political leaders use today against immigrants, or the common hatred expressed by the poor against the \\"rich\\" (composed of everyone who isn't poor). In later parts of the book, however, all of his hatred comes out in a matter ALMOST as disgusting as any opinion expressed by Bill O'Reilly of FOX (USA). He goes on to rant about racial superiority and spells out the alphabet, giving with each letter an explanation of why the Jew is the reason the world is going to hell. He even goes on to say, literally, that the Jew is the incarnation of Satan and the symbol of evil (p.269), which is quite ironical considering that the tilted Swastika that he chose himself as the emblem of his Nazi party earned that title.<br /><br />Before his chapter on race, after having understood his upbringing and the conditions of the era, you could understand how he came to form his opinions. And though you still wouldn't agree with his take on race, you could still not disagree that his arguments were presented in a logical manner (however misconstrued). The good thing is that once you finish reading the first volume of Mein Kampf, you will then earn the right to say that all of his hypotheses, as intelligent and well-presented as they may be . . . can just go to hell.ernational involvement in German culture and economy.

He then goes on to further subdivide races and brings up evolution and natural selection as the reason the world had become plagued by disease, thieves, and poverty. He makes a strong case, though. However, his mere existence is breaks the argument that pure races are stronger by genetics (as opposed to alimentation, wealth, exercise, and education), for the simple fact that he was not physically stronger than any of his counterparts. At first, he was also against socialism. But again, inspired by others, he became a hardcore socialist and enemy of capitalism, as capitalism, in his opinion, would lead to the ruin of Germany.     Now, what's marvellous about the bulk of the book is how well he describes the situation in Germany that led to the creation and the subsequent overwhelming popularity of Nazism (also known as National Socialism). There were some chapters were we could simply change the name of the German parties and use current counterparts and the whole conflict would have applied just as well. Also, his insight about the most effective use of propaganda is brilliant; a quality recipe still used today in many of the so-called free democratic nations of the world. Adolf Hitler, a champion of the poor, an enemy of the ruling classes, a defender against international intervention, a coupster and martyr, an incredibly charismatic leader, a gifted orator, a convincing politician, a relentless leader, a nationalist, a socialist, and a bigot who blamed all the problems of his country on them, them, and them. If he werestill alive, and spoke Spanish, he would have been elected unanimously as president of any Latin American country today.     You could feel Hitler's animosity toward the Jew in earlier sections of the book, but it wasn't any different than the animosity that political leaders use today against immigrants, or the common hatred expressed by the poor against the \\"rich\\" (composed of everyone who isn't poor). In later parts of the book, however, all of his hatred comes out in a matter ALMOST as disgusting as any opinion expressed by Bill O'Reilly of FOX (USA). He goes on to rant about racial superiority and spells out the alphabet, giving with each letter an explanation of why the Jew is the reason the world is going to hell. He even goes on to say, literally, that the Jew is the incarnation of Satan and the symbol of evil (p.269), which is quite ironical considering that the tilted Swastika that he chose himself as the emblem of his Nazi party earned that title.     Before his chapter on race, after having understood his upbringing and the conditions of the era, you could understand how he came to form his opinions. And though you still wouldn't agree with his take on race, you could still not disagree that his arguments were presented in a logical manner (however misconstrued). The good thing is that once you finish reading the first volume of Mein Kampf, you will then earn the right to say that all of his hypotheses, as intelligent and well-presented as they may be . . . can just go to hell.
B000077VOY|5.0|Anything can happen in the next half hour?  It usually didn't but who cares?  Sure the W.A.S.P. (World Aquanaut Security Patrol) crew might meet an underwater version of an alien creature or a bad guy who knows all about the oh so top secret Marineville and wants to destroy it (for unknown reasons since really the fine folk at Marineville always seems to help them out) but really the action in the end just kind of zips by and often the height of the action isn't  even shown.  Doesn't matter.  It's still an addicting must see show.<br /><br />From the theme song with virtually no words that you'll remember (you will be singing Stingray... Stingray... a lot) to the drum beat warning sounds to the bumbling clumsy bad guys who use magical makeup that changes their whole appearance to the fact that our heroes always visit the bad guys house (lair?) and never recognize it the next time -- this is all just too good.  Cheesy may not be the right word as it really was  different for its time and its something between a kids show and a general all age show.  While cheesy might be too strong of a word, it's also not exactly something you can take too seriously.  Still it does build itself around storylines that are generic enough and timeless that they still hold up today:  oil at sea being handled not so well, oceanlife and modern human needs conflicting with one another, governments being overthrown, etc.  And yeah, for the adults there is what appears to be a love triangle, it's just that it is more implied than truly explored as a true storyline.<br /><br />Also, you must watch the behind the scenes feature.  It will make you appreciate this show even more.  Much like the 3D of today, these guys and gals spent hours and hours and days and days to get even the smallest thing to look as good as it did.  So while some people today might be a little surprised to see puppet strings and find the whole show lower production value by today's standards, it's really an amazing piece of tv history (including being the first show of its kind in color).including being the first show of its kind in color).

0439023521|2.0|\\"Hunger Games\\" is a truly dark and disturbing \\"young-adult\\" book.    The fact that it is so popular scares the heck out of me.  I simply cannot get beyond the premise, which is that CHILDREN are encouraged TO KILL OTHER CHILDREN.    Am I so out of touch with our culture that I'm alone in finding this truly creepy, disturbing, and over the top?    Yes, \\"Hunger Games\\" is a compelling read, but not because it is well-written.  It is gimmicky and manipulative in the same way television reality shows such as \\"Survivor\\" are.  The reader reads frantically in the same way a bystander gapes at an accident - in a voyeuristic wish to see something shocking happen.    Hundreds of terrific young-adult survival novels have been published, such as \\"Hatchet\\" and \\"Lost on a Mountain in Maine.\\"  And I can think of several excellent dystopian novels such as \\"The Giver,\\" which is an example of skillful, thoughtful writing and great character development.    Obviously I'm in the minority here, and that fact truly frightens me.  But the only thing new and fresh about \\"Hunger Games\\" is the delightful idea that it's okay to describe young children being murdered in the most grisly fashions.    I don't believe in censorship, but this is one book I would not be comfortable giving my child to read.
B004P9FAK2|1.0|First of all, I will start by saying that I am usually not the type to go on review boards to slam or bash a product, but Warner Bros. officially screwed up with this as far as I'm concerened!!!    I ABSOLUTELY AGREED 100% WITH EVERYONE ELSE ABOUT THE EXTENDED CUT!    I own every single Harry Potter film on DVD, and when I finally got a Blue Ray Player a few years ago, I decided that if I would update my copies of the Harry Potter films to Blu Ray, that I might as well wait and get the \\"Ultimate\\" Editions because they would contain the Extended Cuts...  And so I purchased \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" Ultimate Editions instead of the regular Blu Ray editions (Which are much cheaper) mostly because of the Extended Cuts.  This was the biggest selling point and the main reason to get the Ultimate Editions.     Then they release \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Goblet of Fire\\" in Ultimate Editions but with no Extended Cuts.  They messed up on that because by doing that they are automatically taking away the one incentive that makes it an \\"Ultimate\\" Edition.  Now you're just ripping people off by giving out the same product in a fancier and more expensive packaging.    When \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Goblet of Fire\\" Ultimate Editions came out last year without the Extended Cuts, Warner Bros. made the excuse that this was supposedly because the original Directors of the films didn't want to go back and re-edit a Director's Cut, and so they decided to respect their wishes.      That said, I was hoping that David Yates, the Director of \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" and \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" would be able to do the Extended Cuts since he is technically still working on the films.  So the whole Director excuse to me is complete BS.      Way to go Warner Bros.!!!       I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING THIS! YOU HAVE RIPPED US OFF ONE TOO MANY TIMES!!!
0156907399|1.0|\\"To the Lighthouse\\" is the dullest novel I have ever read. But I should also make clear that I very much like Virginia's Woolf's essays, books like \\"A Room of One Own,\\" \\"Three Guineas,\\" and her other non-fiction.

0061564893|5.0|I don't know anything about this book as it was a gift for my husband.  But I must say he is enjoying reading it and has told me much about it.  It arrived in record time and was in an absolutely great condition.  Will order from this company again without any worry.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This is one of the few shows that both my husband and I enjoy. This is now our go to \\"we had a bad day and want a laugh\\" program. Everyone we have lent the DVDs to is now a fan of the show.    The pilot is the weakest episode, so give it until the 3rd episode for the show to get into its groove. By the time you get to the \\"paintball\\" episode you will realize that there is no show on TV quite like this one.    I would recommend for families with children 15 and up, but it is occasionally too mature for middle school age students.

1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki reminds me of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is a Tibetan spiritual leader, but he is liked in India. I happened to watch him once from a distance. What struck me about him as unique is that a gentle but warm smile never left his face. He easily came across a genial person with a captivating presence, making the listeners believe every word he spoke.    When as a beta tester I first started reading Enchantment, I was struck at Guy's suggestion of 'making crow's feet' on page 9 when he says, \\"A great smile...makes you squint and produces crow's feet.\\" Indeed, what better can influence a newcomer than a warm smile!    The book reveals Guy as a great teacher. He is widely traveled, has met a large cross-section of people from every corner of the globe, and has spoken in many forums in many countries. In short, he knows the pulse of people's hopes and aspirations in the Internet age as they vary from one culture to another, from one country to another.    There isn't a doubt Guy has more experience of knowing people's minds than perhaps most of us, and so in a way my approach to reading the book was to gain some wisdom from the man.     I am not disappointed.    For new readers here is what I've to say. The book is chock-a-block with suggestions, tips, and tricks to succeed in your business. There are many real-life examples that I don't doubt Guy uses when he speaks to an audience. So, if you rush through the book there is a good chance that few things register in your head. Suddenly you feel the book is of no value to you.    Instead, take your time, glance through it to have a broad idea about what it says, and then cover it at a slow pace. It's not a thriller, but kind of reference book rather. To benefit the most from it you need to give some leeway to your time. And yes, practice some of its suggestions.    There is no magic wand in the book. There isn't any in life actually! Enchantment shows the paths to follow. Whether you traverse them and how youdo is for your discretion.     I cannot readily recall reading a similar book in the recent past, so I will refrain from making imaginary comparisons. Let me however say this.    Enchantment will be there on my reading table for a long time. For me it's a reference book that needs frequent look-ins.
0446608955|3.0|The only other Nicholas Sparks' books I've read are The Last Song and The Notebook, so perhaps I'm not adequately informed when I say this, but I found the plot of this to be a bit tired. Just like the other books of his I have read, it was a story of two completely different people falling into a not-so-unexpected romance that was later marred by some devastating tragedy. However, in the end, \\"all is well and everything is as it should be.\\"  That being said, the writing is simple without being dull and the journey is ultimately very moving.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Total MUST read book.  Loved seeing life through his eyes - and could feel his mother's pain both of being captive, and upon finding freedom.
0670022411|2.0|I think this book is overhyped.it's a good start for a first draft of a book but it doesn't deserve all the hoopla it's received. the plot is compelling but the writing drags it down. it's clumsy and heavy handed. sometime i can power through less than ideally written books if the plot moves quickly enough but that is not the case here. could have been a great book but i can't get past the awkward writing and slow pace. i could have skipped the first 200 pages and just read the book jacket. would not recommend. she may be a great writer in another 3 books or so but her style doesn't work for me right now. Also, any fan of fantasy, vampires, witches, etc is going to feel like a college student in a remedial class. overall, disappointed.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|VERY addictive game but frustrating to play as it freezes up every 5 seconds, perhaps a patch would fix this?  I'd love to give this more than one star but it's not worthy yet.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This is certainly original:  it is about ballet, about a very trouble and self-destructive young woman under enormous pressure from her artistic director and herself, as well as her controlling mother, who treats her like a child; there are some weird moments when Nina thinks she is morphing into a real black swan.  Leave it to the director and writers to come up with something bizarre yet very memorable and mesmerizing to watch.    Natalie Portman gives the physical and emotional performance of a lifetime as the bulimic dancer who wants to be perfect but will pay a terrible price for it.  Mila Kunis is fascinating as a rival dancer for whom Nina has an attraction (if you don't want to see girl on girl action, just fast forward a bit), while Barbara Hershey is in full form as Nina's pushy, infantilizing mother.    Great choreography and photography too, and a nice soundtrack.
0316017922|2.0|This is the first book of Gladwell's books that I have read, and I think it will be the last book of his I will. Gladwell's novel really made me think about my own life and opportunities I have been able to receive. This made me realize that my generation has been born into a difficult period, almost as bad as the great depression; the economy is becoming worse, and there are too many workers for too few jobs. Therefore, if people take a look back at my generation, they will see our birth years as disadvantages, and thus a hindrance to our achievements. Although he makes good points of arguments, he fails to realize that there are exceptions to the rules he has created. I believe this to be a little of an advantage as well as a huge disadvantage; this means my generation will have to work harder for what we want and no one can tell us we were lazy and had everything handed to us. Overall, I would give this book a two out of five star rating; although it made me think, I did not like how he believes no one has natural-born talents. I disagree entirely with this thought, and believe everyone has some sort of talent they are born into this world with.

B00000IQW5|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have ever had the privilege of viewing and owning. It is a heartwarming story of love and dedication.     I highly recommend this movie for everyone. It will cause you to hold dearly those you love. We are not guaranteed tomorrow, and should show our love on a daily basis to those who mean the world to us. If you buy this movie you will not be disappointed. It has love, adventure, and humor. What more could one ask for?
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Alien invasion sci-fi flick starring Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez and the r&b singer Ne-Yo. The plot: aliens invade the earth. In Los Angeles, marines fight the aliens. The marines have a victory. The marines then carry on fighting the aliens. And that's about it. Not a great film: indeed, I was yawning and looking at my watch whilst watching it. I felt like I was watching a computer game. Could and should have been much more. Even Skyline was better than this (apart from its ending): more suspenseful, darker, bleaker. At least you couldn't accuse Skyline of being boring. An average film. Wish I had waited for it to come out on DVD instead of forking out £8.80 for a cinema ticket.
1401223176|5.0|I thought I could never love reading another Batman or Superman book.  After countless takes on the Joker, I almost recoil in disgust at another attempt to re-invent the story.<br /><br />Wow- Hush blew me away!  It has the perfect balance of action and psychological introspection and the perfect balance of dark and light.  The writing and the artwork both approach perfection.<br /><br />Hush never gets too bogged down in the dark mind-melt psychoanalytics that Miller falls prey to.  The artwork and colors are much more vibrant than darker treatments of Batman, without the goofy pre-1980s \\"cartoony\\" look.<br /><br />Finally, I was able to get \\"lost\\" in a superhero book - and it was a great place to get lost- uber-detailed Gotham scenes, unbelievably sexy and interesting female villains, and color!  I don't remember enjoying a Batman book this much since I was 8 years old watching the Batman TV show. (Writer Loeb also references his love for that series).<br /><br />As close to perfection as Batman books get.  Even the most jaded super-hero fans will love this series.
B001CZVVVY|5.0|I don't understand what the bad reviews are about. Why the fuss about how this interpretation \\"misses the boat\\" on goals that the production clearly never had? And, not to judge a book by its cover, but if you want Rococo furnishings and all the ladies in hoop skirts or something, maybe don't go for the video with a nearly black-and-white photo on the cover...?    This Blu-ray, in many ways, brings out the best of what opera on Blu-ray can be. As everyone has said, he music and picture quality are dazzling. Also, the high-contrast costuming really makes the characters pop.    The bareness of the stage did a lot for me. It kept me completely engaged in the singing, which is all I want when I've got singers of this caliber. Netrebko's singing is such a delight, and it doesn't hurt that she's enough of a hottie that my boyfriend was willing to sit through the first act with me. I also loved the fact that the lack of stage clutter allowed the characters to sweep from one end of the stage to the other, with cameras chasing them the whole way. It really enhanced the dynamism of the music.    Like some other reviewers, I also appreciated the extra character. Yes, it's a little cheesy in that bordering-on-the-pretentious way, but who cares? Isn't the point of theater -- to have new interpretations? The attitude of \\"same old, same old\\" is precisely why people my age don't go to the opera! Which is precisely why people like me can't afford to go now that we don't get student rush tickets!    The only thing I wish were different is Figaro. WTF? (Why The Face?) It's like watching drunk karaoke amateurs trying to reach the top notes of a Journey song. Made me feel mildly constipated whenever I had to watch him. But small price to pay, since here's another great feature of Blu-ray -- I can skip through his bits when I don't want the bother. And it's a really minor bother anyways.    Overall, I think it's an excellent production with quality music and amusing staging. And aren't quality and amusement what Mozart does best?
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Critic V.A. Musetto reviewed I Spit best:  \\"If you can handle it, see it.\\" A viewer enjoys the catharsis and truthfulness of I Spit on Your Grave. But, whether viewing the 1978 or 2010 version, a viewer more appreciates this story than enjoys it. I Spit on Your Grave (2010) is an admirable work. It updates Day of the Woman for current audiences and culture. Day of the Woman needs to be occasionally retold. I compliment a film willing to do that well. I compliment Sarah Butler and the other actors for taking on such brave roles.     Director Steven R. Munroe has obviously much respect for Meir Zarchi's work. And, mutual admirers will appreciate Munroe enhancements.  For example, in this version, Jennifer has a good reason not to call the police. About the 1978 version, audiences have asked constantly \\"Why the hell doesn't she just call the police?!\\" Also, this version emphasizes Jennifer's revenge more than her humiliation. Both versions should exist. Keaton's Jennifer Hills becomes someone with whom an audience sympathizes/empathizes more. Butler's Hills provides more of a tale of warning. And, Munroe's remake expands upon the rapists' personal lives to make the audience more sympathetic to them. These criminals are not Others from the backwoods; they are potentially a person's neighbors. Finally, the DVD's scene titles pay homage to this controversial classic. The Rape of Jennifer Hills is an alternate title for this film, and it is the chapter title for the rape scene. Appropriately, Day of the Woman is the chapter title for Jennifer's revenge, when this wronged woman has her vengeful day.    EXTRAS:  I am pleased with the extras. A brief making-of documentary provides good information, not just fluff. The disk has trailers for other films--including, of course, the original I Spit. Plus, viewers get deleted scenes. Standard stuff, but well-done.
193659451X|5.0|Jane Austen's Persuasion stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the author's work.  Emma and Pride & Prejudice are equally extraordinary novels and I don't think one has to engage in a tug of war over which is best: each has its charms and delights.  The story of Anne Elliot, who enters into an engagement at age 20, only to succumb to family pressure and break it off, is 28 and alone when we meet her.  Time has proven what she instinctively knows:  Frederick Wentworth was the right man for her and she was foolish to let him go.<br /><br />His reappearance sets the stage for what is, at once a masterpiece of comedy, romance and satire.  Anne's vainglorious father and sisters are deftly skewered, but in that mocking but never mean Austen style.  The appearance of an estranged cousin and Captain Wentworth's apparent attachment to a neighborhood belle complicates matters wonderfully until we reach the inevitable happy conclusion.<br /><br />What sets this novel apparent, I think are two characteristics.  Picking up the story eight years after Anne's mistake is a wonderful device.  We don't meet a perfectly sensible woman (Elizabeth Bennett) or a delightful ingenue (Emma Woodhouse).  Anne Elliot is a mature woman, indeed by social standards close to an old maid, and one left to regret her own poor judgment.  Her situation is one any empathetic reader can identify with (who hasn't judged wrongly in Romance?) and creates a humility that is quite appealing.  Unlike Elizabeth and Emma who need to learn the error of their ways, Anne already knows--she simply needs to be excused them.<br /><br />Secondly, unlike some Austen works, characters are far more dimensional.  Anne is weak, but well-intended.  Wentworth acknowledges he is bitter and resentful and acknowledges he fails to initiate a reconciliation out of pride, losing further years they might have been together.  Elliot pere and Elliot the heir are quite cartoonish as is sister Elizabeth.  However Anne's friend and confident and her sister Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.<br /><br />Is Persuasion worth reading?  Without a doubt!  Where does it fit in the Austen cannon?  I think in the first rank.  But everyone should decide for themselves.er Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.    Is Persuasion worth reading?  Without a doubt!  Where does it fit in the Austen cannon?  I think in the first rank.  But everyone should decide for themselves.

0312323867|5.0|After reading \\"Something Borrowed\\" I did NOT like the character of Darcy.  She annoyed me, and I felt that trying to read this book from her point of view would not last long.

So if you even remotely like \\"Something Borrowed\\" you will LOVE this follow up!!!
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic world, where the countries that populated the continent once called North America have been destroyed, and a new nation called Panem has emerged. Panem is comprised of thirteen cities: The Capitol, and twelve \\"districts.\\" Katniss is a sixteen-year-old girl from District 12. Through a turn of events she is chosen to play in the Hunger Games: a contest in which the winner brings home a wealth of food to their indigent district. The only catch is that the contest is a fight to the death with 23 other contestants from the 12 Districts of Panem.    The author, Suzanne Collins, sets up a very interesting atmosphere for the reader in The Hunger Games. As you read, you have a lot of questions about the mysterious Hunger Games, and the futuristic dystopia Panem. This draws you closer to the main character, Katniss, who is in a similar position. You will soon find yourself immersed in her world, and her fight for her life. Collins' writing style keeps the reader interested, while leaving some of the details of the world she has created nebulous. This adds to the interest of the book, and the readers will find themselves burning through the chapters to finish the story.    I found The Hunger Games to be a well written and intriguing book. As I read, I was drawn into the world of Panem. The plot is very original and gripping, and I found myself living out the Games right along with the main character, Katniss. When you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down.  It is a quick read and the story pulls you right through to the end. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Good series if you like the lives and loves of Henry VIII.  Sometimes over-acted and a little full of itself but generally beats most anything on broadcast t.v. for overall quality.  If you are looking for 100% accurate history, you will not find it here- this is a t.v. drama after all- but they do play if pretty close to form.  Overall an entertaining, quality piece of programming.

0891349553|3.0|My 1st book by Katherine Dewey -Creating Lifelike Figures in Poymer Clay, was absolutely fantastic. When I learned she had written a book on Creating Lifelike Animals,I couldn't wait to get that one too!! She explained proportions of the body to assimilate each animal. It was like starting with a skelton,then adding muscles, and fur.   The infomation on how to make tools for sculpting, was greatly appreciated. I only wished the coloration infomation was more truer to an animal. This is a great book for sculpting animals. I highly recommended it to anyone who loves to create animals.

I restarted the phone and tried again. This time I got Packet errors on the app so it downloaded a fresh copy and then got space errors. Pretty frustrating experience. Samsung Intercept.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The one app I go to everyday. Great app, almost as good as the Word itself. It is functional, easy to search and to get around on.
0876852630|5.0|I bought Ham & Rye and Factotum in the same purchase, before I had ever read any Bukowski.  READ HAM ON RYE FIRST.  I happened to read them in order by complete accident, and it was a very pleasant surprise when I cracked open Factotum and found more of what I loved about Ham.  Factotum is about Henry Chinaski in his high school years and beyond.  He is brilliantly self defeating, much like the real life personality of his creator, Charles Bukowski.  It's hard to see any hard line where Bukowski ends and Henry (aka Hank) begins.  Both novels are simply wonderful, raw and engaging. Highly recommended.  If you enjoy Bukowski's novels, I suggest you pick up some of his poetry as well. \\"Love is a Dog From Hell\\" is a trip, also very highly recommended. You'll be hooked.
0393327345|5.0|The book is one of the most amazing books ever written. I was breathless when I finished reading the last words. Really unexpected. And the service was really quick,even though I'm from Europe. Thank you Amazon!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The pdf reader in stock Android is okay, but when I saw this by Adobe, I thought I should pick it up.    My biggest concern is stability, and this meets it.  I've opened a handful of .PDFs on this and it has yet to crash.    Navigating around a document is quick and easy by using the swiping motions of your fingers.  As for zooming, you can pinch or \\"un-pinch\\" to zoom in and out with the greatest of ease.  It only takes a split second for the screen to refresh to a sharper clarity.  Considering how graphic intensive some of the stuff I look at can be, I thought it refreshed faster than expected.    After using it a couple of days I have now made this the default .pdf reader.  Thanks for putting this together, Adobe!!
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I thoroghly enjoyed this interesting movie. All the actors where exceptional. The story line was good and the educational facts where most enlightening. As Dali would say \\"Superb\\"  The homosexuallity was handled very well and not offensive, well done.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I recently bought a new truck and one of the features I miss most about my old one is that the radio does not display the name of the song on the radio.  Not the end of the world, but now I don't sweat it anymore thanks to Shazam.    Shazam listens to a bit of music for a while (about ten seconds) and then goes out and finds the name of the song, who sings it, and what album it was in.  I've got to admit, some of the albums it returned with surprised me but it always had the song right.  From there it even gave you the option of purchasing the song from Amazon, finding music videos, or even adding it to your Pandora channel list.    When I first got the app I sat in front of the radio switching stations and sampling music.  It came back with the name of the songs 100% accurate. I did this while showing friends and family the power of android, and all of them were pretty impressed, though I did learn that there is some other software that already does this.    Finally, I was at an outdoor even with a DJ blasting music and we wondered the name of a song that was playing.  So I took out my phone and fifteen seconds later I told them the name of the song, the artist, and which album it was featured on.  I looked like a musical genius!!    One of my favorite go-to apps now.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my Samsung Transform (M920). A good change of scenery from the original Angry Birds and Seasons too. A fun addition to any gaming portfolio!

0670022411|2.0|The author included some really intriguing plot points about alchemy & science, but unfortunately, they were way too few. The book becomes really boring very quickly.   This was a really disappointing book. You could save yourself some money and just purchase a Harlequin romance. The plot in \\"Discovery...\\" is trite and the characters are, at best, two dimensional. How this title made it to the bestseller list is beyond me.
B0007TKNII|5.0|really enjoyed this.  My daughter needed to watch for school.  The whole family enjoyed it, even 10 & 13 year old son.
0061726826|4.0|Why I Read this Book: I'm going to be honest, when I first heard about Delirium from those who had attended BEA 2010, I had no interest in reading this book. Yes, I had read Before I Fall and yes, I thought it was a great, moving read. But for some reason or another I wasn't immediately captivated by Delirium. Then I started seeing the reviews and that's what got me. Next thing you know, I was itching to get my hands on this book.    What I Liked: At first, the premise for Delirium didn't really catch my attention. But as I started reading more dystopian novels, I've come to learn that I enjoy reading books from this genre. Before I Fall was well-written, not just as a debut novel but for a novel that focused on retelling the same day over and over - and over again - seven times. That's a hard feat to accomplish without losing a reader from boredom!    I liked that the pacing with Lena and Alex's relationship was believable. If there's one thing about YA novels that annoys me, it's those rapid fire I Love You's exchanged by the main characters after only a week of dating. Lena and Alex are both likeable characters, and each in their own way. At first, Lena is a sheep; she goes along with the program of `love is bad'. But thanks to Alex, she reassesses her opinion and starts to think for herself and begins to have her own opinion on the matter. Alex is a very appealing character; he's the forbidden bad-boy. But he's the guy that makes you question all the rules.    The ending - OMG! - the ending! It sucker punched me. The whole time I was reading the ending, I was thinking No, no. no!!! It felt like I couldn't breathe. My head was spinning. Delirium put me in a funk for a few days. It's hard to let go of these characters.    What I Didn't Like: Delirium was a slow starter for me. It's told in first person narrative, from Lena's POV, so there's a lot of thinking and analyzing going on. Because of this, I wasn't pulled in right away. Delirium didn't grab me until page131, about 1/3 of the way into the book. But after that, I was hooked.    Overall Impression: Delirium will leave a long lasting effect on your heartstrings. It doesn't just pull on them, it YANKS them. This is a book that will have you thinking and it will affect your emotions. It will take you a while, perhaps a couple of days, to recover. Be prepared for the anxiety that is sure to come after you read Delirium and as you wait for Pandemonium, book 2 in this trilogy. It will eat at you for days. Delirium is a definite must-read for YA readers. Fans of Before I Fall will definitely enjoy reading Delirium. I also think fans of Matched will enjoy this book as well.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|From the tags and the comments, this seems to have been hyped as \\"Krall goes Brazilian\\" or something. When did Johnny Mercer, Sammy Kahn, Rogers and Hart, and Lerner and Lowe become Brazilian? There are maybe three Brazilian songs on the album, which is good, because of course they are not the highlights. Did you really have high expectations for \\"The Boy from Ipanema?\\" C'mon.    Krall does her usual job of milking every syllable for the maximum in breathy sexuality. That has been her one trick for her whole career. It has grown a little thin: she has not recorded these songs before but several sound eerily familiar anyway. The sound quality of her previous releases was quite good. This is only average, with less clarity to the percussion and to her voice, which is rather sibilant in this recording. The bass is generic and not very deep, which again is a cut below her previous albums.    I'd put this near the bottom of her discography, right above her Xmas album. If you are a fan you will want to have this but it definitely is not the Krall album to start with.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Gameplay is even better than in the original games! Unless you have a cheap phone, this runs very smoothly. What else can I say? It's a fantastic game for any Android phone.
0670022411|5.0|I'm so happy to find a series that keeps me longing for more!  I will be standing in line for the next one.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Is it that hard to advise which regions can use the app store before we go through the ENTIRE sign up and install process? So US centric that it's offensive. Sorry angry birds, you cop the review because you were the first free carrot offered.
0670022411|5.0|Initially I avoided this book as I am not that into witches and vampires.  What a wonderful surprise!  This books reminds me of the DaVinci Code with its tangled history and unraveling of clues, yet it is clearly written by a woman.  There is a lot of action mixed in with a lot of wonderful history and stimulating ideas.  I guess that's what I liked the best - the interchange of ideas and theories about why we're here and where we're going.  Not in a dull, academic way, but a thrilling and unexpected ride of discovery.  The main character, Diana Bishop is not perfect.  And she confronts difficult situations that she is unprepared for.  She's no super hero, even if it turns out that she has inherited a lot of magical talent.  The book starts with the mystery of her parents' murder when she was 7, and moves to the turning point of her life - meeting an elegant vampire named Matthew.  If you like your thrillers spare and action oriented, this may not be your book.  However, if you like a mix of plot, character, ideas and a little romance, it's a great read.  Just when I thought things were slowing down, a new and fascinating character would appear to cause mayhem.  I have been constantly surprised and delighted.
B003UESJDI|4.0|This clever little gem does a great job of capturing the spirit of the Hardy genre and updating it into to a film that has great pacing, a very healthy dose of black humor, interesting and flawed characters, and outstanding performances. The acting is really noteworthy. And the \\"greek chorus\\" in the form of bored teenage girls was fantastic. Interesting and original.

B0015XHP3Q|5.0|This is a great action movie from the late 1980's. It holds up quite well and does not appear dated in any way. The HD visuals found in this bluray have done the movie justice, as Rambo's blood and sweat is clearly defined and the environments offer great detail. I am greatly astonished that this film in the original Rambo trilogy was critically and commercially trashed in the box office. The movie itself is full of non-stop explosive action. Unlike the first (which does offer a good story), or the cheesy second in Vietnam that was merely alright. The first two clearly don't hold up as well in HD, as the superior action oriented third. I hate when retards bash a movie for deviating from its original story or because it does not offer enough character development. For those individuals they can find what they want by just reading a book! I personally watch a movie for its sheer entertainment value, and if I seek more in the subject matter then I would just watch a documentary. These individuals who bash a movie for its unrelenting action and explosions, essentially kill any possible future sequels. The movies I know that have suffered this fate was of course Rambo 3 in the 80's, which the public clearly spoke by hardly making a dent in its box office numbers(and you dare call yourselves Rambo fans!) There are also other movies, like \\"The Chronicles of Riddick,\\" which obviously was not like Pitch Black with its heavier action scenes that was too much for some folks, which essentially killed any possibility for a third movie in the franchise. Also, there is \\"Terminator Salvation\\", which was a great modern take on the franchise with its direction clearly veering into a dark future war introduced in the original movies. I just believe people should enjoy movies for what they are, and stop complaining about what there not!!! The same could be said about the recent movie \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\", that was bashed for its heavy action emphasis. Those of you that are constantlygetting your unbelievable expectations hurt your just ruining it for everyone else by killing any future sequels with your hate! Consequently, destroying what could otherwise be a great action extravaganza on bluray!!!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I was hooked on this series from Episode 1. My review for Season 3 applies to Season 1 as well. Loved the characters, plots and scenery!
1400079144|5.0|The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown is a real treat for puzzle lovers.  It is a well written mystery with tight suspense and a villain who will scare your socks off.  I liked this story even better than The DaVinci Code.  Woven within the story are all sorts of unusual architectural wonders and the historical, religious and fraternal rituals they relate too.  The story also tells the reasons why some of the nation's Capital buildings were built as they were, explaining the mystical mind set of our country's founders.  The last chapters involve a debate between the characters about the relevance of ancient religious books and modern science that I found very interesting.  This book is a mind boggling experience that should not be attempted without a good supply of comfort food, multiple beverages and pillows because you won't be able to stop reading until you turn that last page.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|Keep on singing Jennifer Hudson.  You have the voice, the talent and you are such an inspiration to us sisters out there that want to lose weight.  I tried weight watchers so many times before but I think this time you have inspired me to know that it can be done.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I didn't expect too much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised. It made me long for more of this genre- a well written story with some good laughs. My wife and I hadn't laughed in a movie this hard in a long time. Hollywood, please keep producing movies like these!
B004CR7TE2|4.0|The first thing I love about this sleeve is that there is a lot more padding than what I am used to in a laptop sleeve. Usually, I carry a lot of things in my handbag and have always used a sleeve but my old macbook pro does have a few random scratches. I've recently picked up the early 2011 macbook pro and I feel a lot more comfortable with this sleeve than the one I was using prior.    The design is clean and sleek, except for two outside pockets, zipper-less. The main compartment does have a great zipper and a nice inner guard so that if crumbs or something gets through the teeth the inner guard gives a little bit more security. It's a great sleeve, mainly due to its thickness/padding, but still feels thin enough to carry and fit into most handbags/briefcases.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|It is just clunky to use.  I was hoping for a similarity between the kindle app and this...nope.  And the best of all is that it makes other apps on my D2 choppy.  Uninstalled and everthing is back to normal.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is really great. Especially if your a BIG electronica fan like myself and live no where near a electronica radio station. There are tons of radio stations to listen to from the U.S or around the world.  I recommend it to everyone!
0060254920|4.0|My husband wanted a copy of the book for his library.  During a lengthy illness he had nightmares, and this book came to mind.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Ever since her first album I have been anxiously awaiting Jennifer's sophomore album to drop and I must tell you that this was worth the wait! This is an album that will captivate you with the first song \\"No One Gonna Love You\\". This is one of those albums that you won't want to skim through or skip songs. Other favs of mine are the beautifully poetic melody \\"Where You At\\",\\"Why Is It So Hard\\",the upbeat \\"Don't Look Down\\" and the 50's big band feel-good song \\"Feeling Good\\". You will not be disappointed at all by purchasing this album. Jennifer's strong soulful voice truly shines and you can't help but feel some kind emotion listening to this. Jennifer Hudson is truly gifted and blessed!
0671027344|5.0|This book was amazing. Im not going to say it reminded me of my high school education, but it did remind me of myself and several of my friends who are all wallflowers.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is a movie about a German entrepreneur named Oskar Schindler who liberated over 1,100 Jews. The irony of the movie is that he was a member of the Nazi party and his factory, which employed Jewish workers, profited from the war. Oskar Schindler developed a conscience during the years and realized that the Jewish people were not the rodents or trash that the Germans believed them to be. Since Oskar had friends in \\"high places\\", he was able to provide immunity and prevent the killing of any of his Jewish factory workers. Although this Steven Spielberg directed movie is three hours and sixteen minutes long, the best part occurred at the end. With Oskar becoming broke from protecting his workers, America had announced the forced surrender of the Germans to the Allies. Oskar Schindler, realizing that he would be punished for war crimes because of his factory front, decided to flee the country with his wife. Just before he got into his car, he had a breakdown in front of all his factory workers and his accountant, who he grew very close to. He was upset with himself that he could not save more Jews while his accountant repeatedly told him that he had done more than anyone could ever imagine.        This movie is about the horrors of the Holocaust and tells the story from the perspective of a German, who gradually develops a deep-found love for the Jewish people. While taking a world religions class this semester and watching this movie, I felt such remorse for the Jewish community. I ask myself, \\"How could Jewish faith still be so strong after the murder and genocide of over six million Jews?\\" Some Jews believe that faith in God will be rewarded and that the true followers of God will be asked to suffer more. They believe that God loves them and will always do what is best even if it's unfathomable to them. (Living Religions 266-268, 277-278)       Although gruesome and cruel at times, Schindler's List is a brilliant portrayal of hope. Even though themovie is long, you will be glued to your television with each passing scene. Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes provided a star studded cast that helped win Schindler's List a plethora of Academy awards. This is a must watch movie, however, I must warn you, \\"It's a tear-jerker!\\"

084428596X|4.0|Concise, sufficient and yet vague in certain areas, I'd give this grammar book a 75/100.  It does go into quite some depth in regards to grammatical components of the language but the structure of the book itself is rather difficult to navigate through and in some areas can be in which seems, ordered illogically.  However I greatly cherish this quite and easy grammar reference and will recommend it to anyone wanting to ameliorate or even learn Norsk :D        julianallees      Den 28 März 2011
B003L77GGK|5.0|I am not a fan of horror usually but this show is the exception.  I watched the first few episodes when it came out and got hooked.  Since then I have not missed a season and own all of the first five.  Every year I wonder how they will continue the storyline and they always find a way.  I can't wait to see what Season 7 is like.
0060012218|3.0|When I was sixteen years old, books like Rainbow Boys, Kissing Kate and this one, Geography Club, really helped me out. They gave me a sense of feeling not all alone- kind of like Russel and his friends in this young adult novel.  Geography Club is simple, hands-on, and funny. One thing that myself and a friend of mine really liked is that unlike most other gay teen books, parents are completely omitted. Not that we don't need stories with parents in them coming to terms with a teen's identity, but it was nice to read a book that focused on the kids. Min and Terese are strong female characters, and Gunnar is a great character (as well as the antagonists, Trish and Kimberly... ew!).     Re-reading it, though, it's a big one-sided with Russel doing all of the talking for everything that happens in the book. There are parts that could have had great dialogue to make other characters (Terese, Belinda, Ike) really interesting. We only really get to know Gunnar, Kevin and Russel. Russel has his charms, and is certainly believable but really wasn't a character I could support or get behind. Still, this is an excellent novel for teens.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|I got my order quickly and the wrapping was not crazy secure and excessive. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B000O77QDI|1.0|The DVD came and does not work at all, in any of my DVD players!!! Very unhappy!! Did not send back because it would not be cost effective.
B002TZVH2Y|3.0|I bought this after reading a strong recommendation from Phil Manzanera.     It's a very accomplished and evocative recording. I have many friends who love it.     But last year I bought 'Related' by Gayngs, and the 'jj no.3' album and I felt like I'd heard a lot of THOSE songs before. So by the time this came along, I was bored with the entire sound.    However, if you're into an updated version of the sonic sweep of late period Japan, early David Sylvian, Cure recordings from the turn of the Eighties, Eno's 'Before And After Science', Bowie's 'Low', or Air's 'Moon Safari', get this.

0060987464|5.0|i loved this book! Great for anyone interested in how Brian got started and how he became who he is today, What made him who he is and how he became marilyn manson. This book tells everything from his grandpa's fetishes to marilyn manson and the spooky kids origin to manson touring the world. Filled with sex, drugs and rock and roll.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I'm not the biggest Michael Jackson fan, not even close. I don't even listen to pop that much. But whenever I put this album on once or twice a year, it still blows me away. I can see why people continuously view it as a mark of excellence. It's like nothing but singles. Technically it's only half singles, but you know what I mean. One of the truly flawless albums front-to-back in music history. Quincy Jones did a perfect job producing. Great track sequencing too. I mean 5 seconds into the album you've just got to move. If I made a cd of best dancefloor songs of all-time it would begin with \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\". Thriller is without question an album that deserves every award and praise it gets. I've got it on cassette, CD and vinyl. It's in a league by itself. Only George Michael's Faith album comes close.
1594744475|5.0|I'm a regular visitor to Pikko's site (Watanabe), but I hadn't visited Maki's before.     This book is based toward kids, but even I don't mind a little kawaii in my lunch occasionally.    What I liked:  - nice introduction to bento at the beginning if you're new to the world  - very colorful and bright pictures and sturdy pages  - their \\"food pyramid\\": 4 parts veg, 3 parts protein, 2 parts carbs, 1 part fruit/dessert.  Yay for healthy!  - each bento has several recipes with it, and they're all easy to mix-and-match  - while this is a charaben book (character bento), none of the ideas are too complicated (usually involve some cutting and/or punching)-- all the ideas seem very feasible!    What I didn't like:  - there's no index.  I remembered seeing a bento that included macaroni and cheese, went to the back to look it up, but nope, no index.  And, when food is sometimes disguised, it makes flipping back through challenging.  - yes, that's all!    While I haven't put together any of the recipes/bento yet, I do have a few planned... visit my blog at [...]!  I never was interested in charaben until I looked at this book, actually; while I enjoy looking at photos of others' charaben, I never had much of a desire to put cute faces on food... until now!  Too bad I don't have any face punches!
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|Its a movie that you want to get excited about instead it just gently pulls you along leaving you waiting for more then entire time.
B002ZG976U|5.0|We saw the movie in the theatre and as soon as it became available for purchase I ordered it.  What a great and entertaining film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this book after I bought my kindle and I'm so glad I was able to fly through all 3 books! It is occasionally annoying watching Katniss being weak and wavering, but I loved the books none the less. It is worth every page and rather addicting. Just wondering when they'll make into a movie. READ THESE BOOKS. I was glad I did.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|This is a great movie filmed in great locations. It was suspenseful throughout, not a typical spy thriller, but a simple yet nuance plot.  Clooney was great. Very understated.  The opening scene is a stunner, sets the stage for the rest of the film.
0307266303|5.0|This is a great book... nice flow... I didn't want to put it down. Awesome story, very inspiring! I'm not a runner... but now... I want to be one. I want to buy a copy for everyone I know... because once they started reading it... I don't think they would be able to stop.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|If you are looking for a \\"feel-good\\" movie in the style of days gone by, this is it.  When I used to watch movies with popcorn on my lap and tissues nearby, I was in heaven.  And if the movie could inspire me and give me a feeling of hope and happiness, so much the better.  This one does all that and more.  The photography and acting is all excellent.  The family really enjoyed it too.  You couldn't go wrong adding this to your library of favorite movies for rainy days!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I guess many people were bewildered and perplexed when this film came out because I think they were expecting an action film or suspense since Eastwood is the director.  But one thing one can expect from this renowned director is the unexpected!!  I've seen this film twice in a theater and plan to view again on Blu-ray, it's a thought provoking drama of a dimension we rarely experience but does exist--the afterlife!!  Matt Damon and Cecile DeFrance are excellent in their roles as a psychic and a survivor who experiences the after-life.  Along with \\"Inception\\", this is one of the most original films from a well respected director--and it accomplishes what it set out to do--and this is to make us think!!  Perhaps years from now it will be held in higher regard as witness Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Marnie\\".  Kudos to Clint for bringing this subject to the screen.
057361606X|5.0|I had heard about William Gillette through a short story and had researched him.  His life is amazing and he did almost as much to create the personna of Sherlock Holmes as was done by the creator.  I had to get a copy of this play Gillette wrote in partnership with Doyle.  A rousing good adventure and I would love to see this on the stage today.
6305882592|5.0|This movie was hilarious and I loved the music from Cat Stevens. I had watched this movie previously but always came in, in the middle of the movie. It was great to see it finally from the beginning and start to understand what it all meant. It's definately a movie I could watch over & over again.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Um, should have named this film; mouth agape. I watched this movie ten years ago and turned it off, \\"boring\\". I guess that's why he's Stanley Kubrick and I'm unemployed. I watched it again tonight and stood through the whole 2 and half hours with my mouth agape. Is he really going there? How did they get that through the studio system. When (if) our society figures out what this movie is about, a lot of \\"christ-mas\\" trees will be burned. Actually to those folks that think this movie is ambiguous, it is anything but. The finger is clearly being pointed to the 5 W's as clear as day. Night however brings another sort of reality, or reprogramming, or abduction or.... And to some of us with \\"clues\\" I'll just say it that way, look into the background for special little symbols and numbers, it's like a little treasure hunt. It's like putting the stamp on the envelope. This may be the scariest movie ever made becuase this isn't Eli Roth (no offense, love your movies). But when Kubrick speaks people listen. And if our civilization is put togather the way Stanley is saying, maybe we don't want to know what is being done to us. \\"I bet he got invited to some real swingin parties in his day. Parties that he really shouldn't talk about, much less make a movie of. Well I guess he got his... natural causes though, ya that's it, it was natural causes. Satan isn't such a bad guy, I mean at least he's not overrated. And to all of you that are wondering if I forgot to take my meds today, it's better for you that you cradle your reality like a sleeping baby, hug it and hold it close, don't let it wake. If what Kubrick is telling you is true. \\"They never told you about the world\\". Go to sleep now, it will all be better in the morning.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Great movie, great shipping. Got to see Battle: LA for free by buying this. Saw District 9 when it came out. A lot of parallels between the two movies (although District 9 is far and beyond a better movie.)
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I was blown away when I found out seiko still makes such an amazing watch. I thought you couldn't get watches with gears and springs for less then several hundred dollars. There's some thing about a battery less watch ticking away on my wrist that just makes me happy. I think this might be the last non luxury mechanical watch in existence. A class of engineering and art just not found in every day products anymore. Even more amazing Seiko makes an entire line of these watches, they just don't ship any of them to the United States.<br />  It is also just beautiful, much lighter, and smaller than I thought it would be. I have battery powered watches that are much bigger and heavier.<br />  My biggest problem is now I want to buy them all. I just can't decide which one to get next. Well I guess what I'm saying is if your even the slightest bit interest in a mechanical watch, buy this one, you'll love it.

Best Birthday present he has ever received!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|In all, the series was good.  However, I don't think it measures up to the bar that was set by Band of Brothers.  They substituted further exploration of characters with extra helpings of explosions, violence, and sex.  In all, the acting is fairly good and the story gives you the feeling of how these folks endured the war.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This nominated documentary is a must watch  - for everyone. We must take care not to let fear and politics guide us into making short-sides, devastating, decisions regarding our energy policy and our environment.

B000PC0S5K|5.0|The content of this book was amazing.     Dealing with my own quarter-life crisis, (laid off, should i go to law school? so many boyfriends and consequently so much anger and cynicism. do i want to continue being a party girl or do i want to settle down? so on and so forth) this book brought me much peace. I'd recommend it to any and every one. In fact, I'm def going to buy the kindle version for reference.    I will, however, agree that it can be a bit redundant, boring and overwhelming. I had to borrow this book twice (for months at a time, after countless renewals) from the library because I just couldn't \\"get into it\\". After forcing myself to sit in a quiet room with no distractions and finishing it, I don't regret a single bit. It's def something you can gain so much from...once you force yourself through the boredom. :)
B00006I53S|5.0|I started \\"prosumer\\" photography with a Canon 20D kit.  It was and is a good camera and took good shots.  However, when I finally decided that I needed to invest in better lenses this was my first choice based upon some online photography sites.    This is now the lens that stays on my camera most of the time.  The IS gives you consistently sharp shots.  It has a very good range from fairly wide to fairly long.  The quality of the optics makes your shots look great.    The only place I've found this lens lacking is in relatively long low light shots.  However, those shots really are the realm of lenses costing 2 to 3 times as much.    As another reviewer said this is a fantastic \\"walkabout\\" lens.  I honestly wish I'd skipped the one in the kit and went straight to this lens.

B001G8NW6Y|5.0|This book was written in the 1940s, so you have to take the examples as they are written for that era (i.e., railroads, radios, etc.) and equate them to modern technology. Nevertheless, the SOLID economic lessons in this book can not be refuted.<br /><br />All Liberals should read this book and rethink their twisted outlook on life and economics. This book is definitely NOT, \\"from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs\\", or to quote our current fearless leader, \\"we need to spread the wealth around.\\"<br /><br />The book gives real world examples to illustrate its points. Everyone should read this book, especially high school children, before they become brainwashed by the far-left and the unions in this country.

I was 3/4 of the way through it when I realized how repugnant the \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" was and immediately got rid of it.

B004L3AQFG|2.0|I turned this movie off half way through. I was bored to tears with this drawn out story. Gave it two stars because the acting was good
0930289234|5.0|This graphic novel was more than anything I could have hoped for. I read it for the first time while stationed in Iraq about a year before the film came out. Here is a pretty simple break down of what makes this novel great.<br /><br />Pros<br />-The characters are original and intrueging. Rorshach is a darker and more twisted version of batman (my favorite super hero). He has a great back story and is a non-conformist vigilante. Dr. Manhattan, the all powerful<br />super-human has a way of looking at his life and humanity in general that i havent seen in any other series. His personality is refreshing and original, but still believable for person put in his position. The other charcters are less interesting but are still interesting and the story is better for having every one of them.<br /><br />-Story line. While it starts off a little slow, it quickly picks up and emerges the reader into a dark world full mystery and excitment. The story behind the formation and falling apart of the watchmen is interesting, as is the reformation of them. The ending was perfect. Unlike the end to many books and comics, this was unexpected and still believable.<br /><br />-The art. While I am not overly adept at picking apart artistic work, I can say that the illistrations were perfect. Although colorful, they were dark at the same time, not taking away from the feeling of the comic.<br /><br />All in all, one of the best reads out there. An enthralling adventure consisting of everything you could hope for in a graphic novel.

1591843790|5.0|As a small business owner, I'm continually looking for ways to promote and grow my company. My desire is to create fantastic products so that existing customers will share their experience with others who might also like my products. In a nut shell, I want them to be enchanted with my company.    I employ a variety of marketing approaches, but walking the tightrope between promotion and sales is hard to do and is fraught with danger. Push customers too hard and they are immediately turned off. Don't push hard enough and my business becomes lost in the jungle of other businesses who are doing it better.     Enter Guy Kawasaki's new book called Enchantment, The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions. His book is filled to the brim with practical and concrete ways you can make your business enchanting. Kawasaki worked for one of the most enchanting companies out there: Apple. He uses his experience from Apple, as well as from his other successful ventures, to show the reader how they can do the same thing.     The book isn't just theoretical; rather, it is stuffed with great ideas that you can implement today. Right now. His approach is don't wait, just go for it. Provide customers something amazing, treat them with respect, solve their problems and enable them.     Kawasaki pulls examples from business luminaries such as Richard Branson and Steve Jobs, all the way to individuals that you've never heard of.  In fact, one of the things I really like about Enchantment is how Guy strongly encourages working with \\"nobodies.\\" In fact, he says, \\"nobodies are the new somebodies.\\" What he means is that in this world of Twitter and Facebook, everybody has the ability to promote, recommend and encourage others to buy your product. Treat every person you come across as if they are the most important person in your marketing plan. You never know what value they might bring to your company.    There are a few companies in this world that are truly enchanting and Guy has outlined a straightforward path for us to do the same. Our task is to take his sage advice and get crackin'. As he says in chapter 8, engage fast, engage many and engage often. Now, it's time for me to stop writing this review and start enchanting my customers!     Mike Hagen  Out There Images, Inc.  [...]
044661758X|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Michael Connelly and have read all of his novels.  Of course they can't all be the favorite, so I don't feel too bad giving only one of his books a less than stellar rating.    The Concrete Blonde was my least favorite of MC's books.  The primary reason was because I had the killer pegged almost right away.  I'm one of those people who loves to guess, but I actually prefer being wrong.  MC usually does such a great job of adding so many twists and turns throughout his stories that I wind up changing my mind a few times while trying to figure out what really happened.  So for me, it was a disappointment that I could figure this one out.    Also, a lot of this story occurs in the courtroom over something that is frustrating and annoying to read about.  I wanted to skip over those parts, particularly since they were disjointed from the story and weren't even important.    ******************Spoiler Alert******************    To make matters worse for me, the final victim was someone I despised through the entire book because of what she was doing to Harry in the courtroom.  I thought she was such a horrible representation of the legal system AND ethics in general, that I wasn't even sorry that she became a victim.  I actually thought she kind of got what she deserved.  And yet, this moment became pivital.     Lastly, I rarely find that any character in an MC's book has no significance at all.  But there is one in this book - the bum outside the courtroom - who is unusually meaningless to me.  Maybe if I could have gotten more invested in the story I would have drawn more from his statements to Harry, but as it stands, I found his presence in the story to be pointless.    ***************end spoiler********************    I'm probably being a little too picky, but it is only because I've learned to expect so much from MC's books.  As I said before, they can't all be my favorites.  If you are a fan and plan to read the whole series, then obviously you should include this book.  But if you are new to Michael Connelly, then I would recommend starting with a different book.  I don't think this book will give you the best picture of what he is capable of.
B004QL7K9I|5.0|''Tucker and Dale vs. Evil'' is such a hilarious and original movie. It will be a real shame if director Eli Craig will not make another part for ''Tucker and Dale'' series. It's a really awesome comedy with very well written script. After seeing many Hollywood comedies, this is what I would call a ''comedy of the year''. And the cast for the movie is really great. All actors done a very great job. Exceptionally I love Allison(Katrina Bowden) and those 2 main heroes: Tyler Labine(Dale) and Alan Tudyk(Tucker). They've done a really great job and those 3 are my favorite actors from now on. As for me, I'd love to have a chance to meet Katrina Bowden and Tyler Labine in real life. If that'd be possible I'd love to see them 3 in another movies. It's an exceptional hell of a great movie and it is a must have!  I see no downsides but that I hunger for more : )

B004L49K20|5.0|This album does not have any weak tracks on it. Everyone is saying how this is a \\"retro\\" album and has that 80s sound, but it is so much more than that. I can easily hear influences from throughout their career. There is a bit of Liberty, Medazzaland and even Arcadia in this aside from the more obvious Rio styles and a bit of their roots from the first album. Yet, this album does not sound dated in any way. It is fresh and classic @ the same time. It has everything from the Duran Duran ballads we all know and love to fun and funky songs with killer bass grooves, like Safe. There are songs to dance to and songs to get romantic to.     As a lifelong fan, I have heard it all. I also love most of every album they have made. Yes, there were a few odd choices along the way, but part of what I love about this band is their refusal to limit themselves. As for the last album, Red Carpet Massacre, while there are tracks I love immensely, I can also see where it was a difficult situation. They HAD been recording and doing what they do, only to have some record exec in a suit tell them it was not what the label wanted. They were pushed into working with someone who has worked well in the past with solo artists, but really did not know what to do with a band like Duran Duran.    This time around, they were free to work with someone who understood their sound and where they could take it. While I credit Mark Ronson for giving the band a bit of a kick start and pushing them to open up and do what they do, you also have to remember, this is Duran Duran. With this album, they are taking back the reigns of the sound so many bands have emulated since they introduced it. I would be perfectly happy to see them collaborate with Mark again, as I am sure Mark would be. I am very happy to have seen some very positive reviews of the album and of their recent live appearances. But then, any Duranie will tell you they are aDDictive live! One show is never enough! So my advice is buy this album, let all of your friends listen to it and by all means, go see them when they come through your area. You will not regret it!
B000002P5R|5.0|Jimi Hendrix was possibly the most inventive, original and prolific musician/performer of his era, and carved out new territories of possibility for the electric guitar. He composed and recorded more great material in five short years than do most musicians in a lifetime career ten times as long. He was imitated by thousands, but equalled by none.<br /><br />Following Jimi's untimely death in September 1970, a great volume of his hitherto unreleased material was put out first by Track Records, and later by Polydor. The first major posthumous release was `The Cry of Love' vinyl album (CD format didn't arrive on the market until the 1980s) released by Track Records in 1971 which contained, in running order:<br /><br />Side 1<br />1. Freedom<br />2. Drifting<br />3. Ezy Ryder<br />4. Night Bird Flying<br />5. My Friend<br /><br />Side 2<br />6. Straight Ahead<br />7. Astro man<br />8. Angel<br />9. In from the Storm<br />10. Belly Button Window<br /><br />`Cry of Love' can still be found on both the original vinyl and a later CD format, but good copies command high prices.<br /><br />`First Rays of the New Rising Sun', thought to be Hendrix's own chosen title for his planned 1971 album, contains all the above tracks, some digitally re-mastered (though it's hard to tell the difference) plus several bonus tracks originally released by Polydor in the mid-1970s variously on the albums `Rainbow Bridge,' `Experience' and `War Heroes':<br /><br />* Izabella<br />* Room Full of Mirrors<br />* Dolly Dagger<br />* Beginnings<br />* Stepping Stone<br />* Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)<br />* Earth Blues<br /><br />All these pieces with the exception of `My Friend' (a kind of late-night studio oddity from 1968 which didn't make the `Electric Ladyland' album) were composed and recorded in the spring and summer of 1970 and feature Brit-drummer Mitch Mitchell from the original `Experience' trio and Jimi's old army buddy Billy Cox on bass, who worked with Jimi in place of Noel Redding following the `Band of Gypsies' period. Overall it's pretty much the definitive collection of Hendrix's late-period material and a fine complement to his earlier finished products `Are You Experienced', `Axis Bold as Love' and the seminal 1968 epic `Electric Ladyland.'<br /><br />If you want to know why Jimi Hendrix is so highly revered by other rock musicians, listen to this collection and you will begin to understand. It's amazing to hear how fresh these recordings are: after 40 years they might have been recorded yesterday, they sound so contemporary; whilst so much music in the intervening period - especially from the 1980s - sounds old and dated. The musicianship here is exemplary, the compositions innovative, exciting and complex, the production values on the whole very high. What wonders Jimi might have produced as a more mature musician and composer we can only speculate: he was a true musician's musician, a one-off.<br /><br />BTW if you want to listen to `Cry of Love' as originally released in 1971, just mix the 10 tracks into the 1-10 order above and miss out the extra seven, crank up the volume and press `PLAY'.

B000BKDOCA|5.0|This Britney Spears \\"B in the Mix, the Remixes\\" collection is a high-energy and fun dance collection.  All of the songs that are remixed come out sounding very good to listen to.  A couple of the musical tracks on this cd that stand out in a great way to me are: \\"And Then We Kiss\\" and \\"Early Mornin\\". \\"And Then We Kiss\\" is a very sensual song that is about more than just the actual kissing, and involving the whole experience of being touched and held.  \\"Early Mornin\\" is a fun song about the \\"adventures\\" that someone goes on while going out, and taking chances in pursuing the person of their interest. The character of \\"Early Mornin\\" can be best characterized as self-confident and insatiable because she goes after what she wants when out dancing, and stays out all night until the morning (hence the \\"Early Mornin\\" moniker), and then does it again when it suits her.  Obviously, with this quality remix collection you get the romantic side of Britney with \\"And Then We Kiss\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\".  Then you get the uninhibited side of her with \\"Early Mornin\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Breathe On Me\\".  This compilation is best enjoyed if you like dance/pop and/or songs by Britney.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I'll be the first to admit that I am not the greatest fan of Harry Potter. The first six movies, though, are enjoyable. For the most part, they are a nice mix of tension and comedic relief. However, when the Deathly Hallows Part I credits started to roll, my first reaction was: That's it!? The tension throughout the movie was constant and high. About midway through the film when our heroes were beset once again with trouble, it thought \\"ho, hum, there's another set back.\\" Because of the consistent level of tension, I had no sense that the film was even coming to an end, and was taken quite by surprise at the suddenness of the ending. It held no dramatic effect whatsoever for me.

The book is easy to read and easy to comprehend, has captivating plot and funny characters that you are going to enjoy much.    If your choice to read this book is based on seeing Miyazaki´s film adaptation, which is my case, then please note that the book and the film have not much in common except of main characters (Sophie, Howl, his apprentice)and begining of the story, when Sophie is transformed into an old lady by the Witch of the Waste.    The story of the book is far more complex and captivating than a film adaptation could ever be.     Spending money on this book is not a waste.

This was an Amazon recommendation based on how much I loved So Many Books, So Little Time: A Year of Passionate Reading, and I was a little hesitant since I'm not really a follower of the Royal Family, but I'm glad I went for it. It's Bennett's imagining of how the Queen might develop a love for reading late in life and it had me chuckling within the first few pages. It's a quick, witty read with the perfect ending.

030746363X|5.0|I enjoyed reading Tim Ferriss's book \\"The 4-Hour Body\\".   Reading manuals of any kind doesn't seem like too much fun to me, but this book was a lot of laughs and had some useful information regarding styles and types of exercise, proper form, et cetera.   Tim has a way of writing that is tantamount to sitting across from him in a coffee shop while he discusses all the ways you can get into exercise (grimace), nutrition (yum) and, er, better sex (grin).  Although I am not a person in training or working up for any type of marathon, I do have a family member that runs marathons and trains, and I plan to purchase another copy of this book to give to the \\"family running man\\"; as I think he'll also enjoy reading the information in this book.   Not sure he'll employ the info, but it is an easy \\"manual-type\\" book to read.  I came away from reading this book with a renewed sense of purpose as far as getting more exercise and thinking about and making healthy choices.   All in all, I would recommend this book.

B004M6BQ9W|4.0|The plot is simple: girl from Midwest comes to LA to make it big. No surprise there. The big surprise is Christina Aguilera and the caliber of acting from the stars that makes \\"Burlesque\\" the show to watch. \\"Burlesque\\" is the movie that \\"Showgirls\\" never was and never will be, sex with heart.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci is superb as the gay dresser and Cher's (Tess) best friend. He is at his campy best and Cher isn't far behind, playing the owner with vamp appeal and a world-weary brittleness that is vintage Cher. She does need to stop with the collagen injections; her mouth is far too stiff, but her voice, like a fine Napoleon Brandy, has improved with age.<br /><br />The real star of \\"Burlesque\\" is the stunning and sweet Christina Aguilera, whose voice is as rich as her style. She plays naive and eager Ali on a believable note that is almost as good as her singing. The dancing is a little less than perfect, but, like Stanley Tucci says, you can't take your eyes off her.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Have you ever stopped to ask yourself, \\"Shoot, what if we were to be attacked by aliens for real? How would our government respond to such attacks? Who would be the initial responders?\\" These are questions I have often wondered myself every time I watch the typical alien-invasion movies, whether it be \\"Alien\\", \\"Predator\\", or just any other alien movie ever made. Being in the military myself, I tend not to watch goofy alien-invasion movies where they have B actors portray men and women in uniform. I mean, seriously, the United States Marine Corps is the best trained conventional force in the world. They see something as horrific as an alien invasion, something that no one is prepared for, and they go TO the fight. It is what they do, no matter what the opposition is. In this case, the fight was nothing like the Marines have encountered in the past, since these aliens are armed and equipped with farly-superior weaponry and body armor. Marines are taught to improvise, adapt, and overcome any obstacle set before them. For example, there is a part in the movie where the platoon leader (fresh out of ROTC) leads the Marines into an alley with no exit. It's an ambush. There is no exit. What do the Marines do? They make their own exit. I watched this movie the other day, and I realized - if LA (or any city for that matter) were ever attacked by aliens, this is exactly how conventional ground forces would react to the situation. What is really amazing is the amount of cooperation the production company received from the Marine Corps (and you can tell these actors were coached by real-life Marines). The acting may have been second rate, and not on the same scale as other \\"masterpiece\\" movies made these days. But it's a movie that is as close to reality minus the whole \\"alien invasion\\" thing. To sum it up in one sentence, this movie is a combination of Black Hawk Down and Independence Day.

B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one of my favorite anime movies.  Its extremely charming, appropriate for everyone, and has a good lesson involved.  What's not to love in a movie?<br /><br />In this animated movie, Chihiro, a young girl, is traveling to her new home with her mother and father when they get lost.  They find themselves in an abandoned town that is filled with some good food.  Her mother and father start eating while Chihiro explores and when she gets back they have been turned to pigs.  With the help of Hoku, a young boy who mysteriously appears, Chihiro learns that she is in the spirt world, most specifically at a bathhouse run by a devious witch.<br /><br />At the bathhouse Chihiro learns what hard work and kindness is as she seeks a cure for her parents.  She also becomes friends with Hoku and has to help him and the bathhouse when trouble is afoot.  Its an awful lot for a young girl though, specially one that isn't used to hard work.  Sometimes Chihiro wonders if she'll ever get home.<br /><br />Even though Chihiro is supposed to be annoying I never really get that from her.  She just seems like a young timid girl to me that faces a lot and has slightly mean parents.  All of the people of the bathhouse are interesting; they're unique spirits to be sure.  And Chihiro finds some good friends there as well.  There are a couple of \\"scary\\" characters in this that might frighten younger children, but they add a lot to the plot and it is interesting to see Chihiro interacting with them.  Hoku especially is a hard character to read but even so, the viewer has to trust Chihiro in regards to him.<br /><br />There are some unusual plot elements to this movie and rituals that I don't quite understand.  I judge them to be either the makings of a child's mind or something exclusive to the writer's country that they would understand there.  Regardless, it makes it whimsical and doesn't detract from the story at all.  And it is a good story about growing.  Chihiro does a marvelous job and really develops some loyalty to her friends.  While the ending does rush a bit, it still is very nice and finishes out the story well.  I was pleased with it anyway.<br /><br />For cinematography, since it is a cartoon type film there's not special effects per say.  But the animation is done really well, there's a lot of neat scenes in this movie.  Most especially the train ride is very poignant to me.  Combined with the great music in this film, it just really speaks to you.  A lot of the other scenes are touching as well.<br /><br />A really touching movie and good for the whole family.  Even if you aren't a fan of anime, this is one you should see.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011to her friends.

B001CFLHJA|5.0|I've kept an ear to the newer directions of jazz to the best of my ability. While a lot of it is enjoyable, Invisible Cinema is a smoldering affair between four supremely talented musicians. This quartet plays with a kind of passion I haven't heard since the 60s and 70s, the kind of intensity you would expect from group led by McCoy Tyner or Charlie Parker.    Parks has been compared to his peers many times, but for this selections of songs, it reminds me of the kind of mixed composition of Chick Corea's better acoustic quartet works, namely Three Quartets. All the seasons seem to be covered here, and there are shortage of soaring melodies and staccato vamps to haunt you long after putting away the CD.    Extra marks to guitarist Mike Moreno, who has such a wonderful ear for melody and building on the standing composition. Double extra marks to drummer Eric Harland who lights fires where you least expect them -- a sleek and powerful engine driving an ambitious set of compositions. I think Parks and his mates far exceeded what they set out to achieve, because this entire CD is imminently listenable, and possibly a classic that will stand the test of time.
0525951652|5.0|This was a deeply fascinating trip back into the world during a difficult period of history. The characters were well rounded and the conflicts vivid and believable. It was hard to put down and I look forward to the next piece of the trilogy.
0800141849|5.0|I first saw this movie back when it came out on home video. I had wanted to go see it at the cinema when it was there, but never got to it before it left the theater. The acting is stellar. Streisand and the other cast members are excellent in their roles. When I first saw this film, I instantly liked it. The song sung by Streisand (dueting with Bryan Adams) which is played during the closing credits is another well loved song of hers that is right up there with Evergreen, The Way We Were, etc. That song is so wonderful. I bought the DVD used and was quite disappointed for these reasons:  a) The movie is in FULLSCREEN instead of WIDESCREEN.  b) The subtitles are in Spanish and Korean only; no English ones (this really tees me off)  c) There are no special features or added \\"bonuses\\" for this DVD.  I am giving this DVD a full five star rating in spite of there being no special features and that this film is not in WIDESCREEN. Persons (including myself) who are fans of Barbra Streisand and who like this movie a lot deserve to see it in its intended widescreen form and have special features (with English subtitles as well, HELLO!!). If there is indeed a widescreen version of this film on DVD, WHERE IS IT for God's sake???
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This gamer is awesome. It only has three stars because of all the whiners. Don't listen to them. It's angry birds after all. 5 stars.
B00001W9G0|3.0|I saw The Way We Were last night for the very first time on TCM. And while I liked it, I didn't think it was a great movie. In fact I thought it suffered from being too Hollywoodish, which is kind of funny since \\"being too Hollywoodish\\" is a major part of the plot.<br /><br />I thought Streisand was wonderful and her character was fully developed, if a bit cliche. I never got into Redford's character, mostly because there was no way that haircut was Navy regulation in 1944. Also, his character wasn't fully developed and was a bit cliche. All the supporting characters were a bit cliche, too.<br /><br />You begin to see the problem.<br /><br />Of course, this movie was never intended to be an historical examination of America during three turbulent decades. (More's the pity.)  It's supposed to be a love story. I agree it's a pretty good love story. That part is believable and watchable and moving. We kind of like the characters and we want to see what happens next with them.<br /><br />But it's all so shallow. There's no real emotional depth. Streisand does the best she can. She's lucky because she has the better character to play. Even so I didn't feel the chemistry between her and Redford was there. They never clicked for me. Yes, they played well together, the relationship was (mostly) believable, but the intangible chemistry that shines between two actors in other love stories wasn't there for me. Or, if it was, I didn't see it.<br /><br />The title song is excellent and beautiful. But I shouldn't have to listen to a movie title song to gain insight into the movie I am watching. I dunno who wrote and directed this movie, but imo they fumbled it a bit.

0316017922|3.0|Sydney Steere  Outliers Book Review    Outliers was an intriguing book that was full of many statistics, that you might not have heard elsewhere, about what factors cause success for people. However, I was not keen on this because I felt as if the author made it seem that if you did not fall under one of his categories for success, that you would not have success in life. It was almost insulting that he had an underlying theme of even if you work your hardest in life to achieve success, you may not reach it since there are certain factors that people are born with or that they go through that grant them success and that anyone without them will never be able to gain such aspects. The book, however, did have its interesting points, such as the story about the Italian immigrants who came to America and settled in their own village that seemed to be separated from the rest of society, and how this group of people managed to have the highest amounts of success in maximum life span, little crime and deception in their town, and overall happiness that was based solely on a good sense of community and neighborhood. Overall, I would have to give this book a three stars out of five rating, considering the fact that the book did have some good valid points about how some kids have higher chance for success based on just simply their birth date and how they grow up to be bigger and stronger than others close to their age group. But the book did have a false sense of workmanship in the fact that he made it seem that these people did not have to do much to be successful in life, whilst realistically some people work very hard in their life to get where they want to be, and that is why I do not believe this book should receive a five star rating.

031261246X|5.0|Zero Day relives the horror of 9/11 and is a warning of a different type of terror attack that could take place if we don't start putting prevention and protection measures in place.<br /><br />The author, Mark Russinovich, holds the senior-most technical position at Microsoft, a Technical Fellow, and is the author of the popular Sysinternals diagnostic utilities. Mark joined Microsoft after Microsoft acquired Winternals software, which he co-founded in 1996. Mark is a cyber security expert and discovered the famous Sony rootkit whose function was to prevent users from copying their media. Mark is a contributing editor for Technet Magazine and a senior contributing editor for Windows IT PRO Magazine.<br /><br />It still seems surreal when I think back to that day on 9/11. Zero Day goes over some of the events leading up to that day, fictional events I hope. But, not much different and less shocking than the supposed real events that occurred. I got choked up recalling the catastrophe that should never have happened. The complacent attitudes that our bureaucracy took in the years leading up to 9/11 should hopefully teach us to never again let our guard down.<br /><br />There are so many home owners, as well as businesses, that do not understand the importance of protecting their computer systems, until it is too late. People go along day to day never thinking about the day when their systems might crash. Zero Day is a great read because it is a combination fictional thriller and truth.

0670022411|4.0|The first half of this book was slow and kinda cheesy.  The book was painfully slow getting the intrigue.   Once it was there, the book was a really good read; filled with history, fantasy, and a solid plot.   Looking forward to the sequel, just wish we didn't have to wait so long.
0385341008|5.0|I can't believe I didn't read this book until 2 years after it was published! It was recommended by Elizabeth Gilbert, so I picked it up and thoroughly enjoyed it too. In fact, I laughed out loud so many times, my neighbors wondered if I was doing another Laughter Yoga workshop.<br /><br />While it took me awhile to warm up to the story all written in the form of letters, once they started coming from the intriguing folks of Guernsey, I was in. The main character, Juliet, is one of those spunky, witty heroines that I adore, and the Guernsey folk fall in love with her and vice versa, with me in the mix. Believe me, I didn't want this book to end. I wanted to be on the next boat to Guernsey, in time to take part in the next Literary Society meeting.<br /><br />Despite the horrors of WWII related in the book, I was left with a smile and grateful tears that such brave, loving people could populate our world.<br /><br />Namaste!

0321544080|5.0|Originally reviewed on SafariBooksOnline -[...]    I just finished reading this book on SafariBooksOnline and will be purchasing a hard copy. Joe \\"Numnuts\\" McNally is an amazing photographer specializing in flash photography. You can read more about Joe from his website - [...]     The first four chapters are examples of Joe's work.  In each example, he provides a background story which is used to emphasize an important point or lesson. The pictures are just amazing, and the stories are often amusing or poignant, but they're all thought-provoking. He also provides notes on how he established the shot. I often found myself going back and forth from the story to picture to study how he did it. I had over 18 bookmarks to remind myself of some of the lessons.     For example:  \\"Take this to the bank when shooting candlelight: ISO 400, 1/15 second, f/2.8-and a-half. Give or take a smidge (technical term). Flash settings: dial -2 EV (exposure value), and put half-cut of CTO (an amber/warm gel) over the flash head. That's it. Looks like candlelight.\\"     My other two favorite sections are \\"Joe's Lighting Tips\\" and \\"Joe's Camera Bag\\". I was drooling over all his equipment gears. The last chapter - \\"The Barroom: The Bar is Open\\" - are war stories from his photography assignments. I was at times laughing in tears or teary eyed from these stories.     This is one of those perfect books you want laying around your house so friends and family can pick up to read and get lost into it and not even realize it.

0393338827|5.0|\\"The Big Short\\" chronicles the spectacular rise and fall of the subprime residential real estate market, and features the very small handful of speculators who saw the tsunami in the distance, and who scrambled to position themselves for massive profits when the waves hit.    Michael Lewis has a special gift of turning a story whose audience would naturally be very limited, and turning into a compelling read for anyone looking to kill a few hours.  How many housewives would be snapping up copies of \\"The Blind Side\\", about the left tackle offensive line position?  In \\"Moneyball\\"--about a team I don't like (the Oakland A's) playing the world's most unwatchable and boring game--you couldn't wait to see what the next 10 pages had in store for you.  That a book about the use of baseball statistics in managing a baseball team would actually turn into a thoroughly enjoyable experience says much more about the author, than the subject.    And as before, the characters come alive in your hands.  His metaphors are so good (the balloon rising from the earth, with bodies still dangling from the ropes, for example) that one wonders if he came up with them himself.  Probably so.    Eisman and Burry, the primary protagonists in the book, are celebrated for seeing what very few did, and fewer still managed to capitalize on.  The book lays out how the subprime lending industry was built on frauds, by frauds and total incompetents.  How the Wall Street trading desks exploited small holes in the rating agencies' models and drove bomb-laden trucks through them.  How those closest to the calamity were gaming the system, and yet it never occurred to them that it was destined to blow up, spectacularly, because of it.  It was like watching a guy build a giant bomb, piece by piece, then wonder why he blew up his house.    The one thing the book lacked, in my view, was some honest introspection as to the means with which they made their billions.  The credit default swap (CDS) was a tool bywhich the holder of a large portfolio of bonds could buy insurance in case of their default.  It might be worth it for me, in the event I bought $10 million worth of utility bonds, to buy insurance in the event the utility goes bankrupt.  Or, more to the point, if I had a giant portfolio of subprime mortgage bonds.  That's what a CDS is for.  Wall Street bent over backward to create CDS's out of whole cloth, for the benefit of speculators who had no interest in buying the underlying bonds.  The market already has arrows in the quiver for a speculator who believes a company--or an industry--is about to collapse.  He can short the stocks of the companies, or buy long-term puts.  But instead, they created instruments out of whole cloth, because they could.    The difference is this:  suppose you believe that building in the New Orleans area is folly, and that it's just a matter of time before they're wiped out.  You can warn people.  You can sell short companies that have their operations in New Orleans, or buy puts on those companies.  You can carefully screen insurance companies and banks that are heavily concentrated in New Orleans, and who stand to get wiped out, and buy puts on their stock.  But what you cannot do is buy flood insurance on properties in the Lower Ninth ward, unless you own property in the Lower Ninth ward.  Insurance products aren't for speculation, but to hedge insurable risk that you have outstanding.      So what do these guys think now?  AIG is in receivership, because it went bankrupt making good on the CDS bets these and other speculators made against subprime, their losses made good by the US taxpayer.  If they had known that Americans would have their taxes and borrowing costs go up for the next hundred years to pay their bets off, would they have gone ahead?  Citigroup stock went from nearly 55, to 1.  A LEAP for a strike of 10 would have gone up 180 times, and the losses would have been borne by someone other than taxpayers.  Why not dothat instead?  The trade would have been no less spectacular; probably more so.  What is the answer for the next time?  Should speculators be allowed to buy insurance on assets they don't personally own?  What should be done at the ratings agencies to ensure that qualified people are rating the bonds?  What should be done at the supervisory level (regional Fed banks, the SEC)?  What needs to be done to rein in Wall Street trading desks, whose interests are so completely at odds with their clients and customers?    Wall Street gamed the system and built a wrecking ball that has played havoc with the economy.  These speculators--shrewd and bright as they were, no question--were motivated by the same thing:  creating absurd products from which they would profit spectacularly, and sloughing off the risk elsewhere.  Do they feel their trade was as noble, knowing that the proceeds of the payoffs came from the US taxpayer, and not the investors in AIG?  From the directors of Bear Stearns and Lehman?      I wouldn't have minded 10 more pages.

1439152780|4.0|I've read Kate Morton's other books The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden so I was looking forward to The Distant Hours; while I liked it very much it fell a little bit short of the other two, both of which I loved.<br /><br />The storytelling device is again the same, intertwining stories that are told from two time perspectives, 1992 and 1939 - 1941.  It all begins with a letter that is delivered 50 years after it was posted.When Meredith Burchill receives the letter her daughter Edie is present and sees that the letter has deeply disturbed her mother.<br />Meredith refuses to talk about it, but eventually Edie learns that during the war her mother was evacuated from London to the countryside. Meredith lived at Milderhurst Castle, home of the famous author Raymond Blythe and his three daughters.  After a while Edie decides to find out about her mother's life at Milderhurst and becomes entwined in the lives of the three sisters Blythe; Percy, Saffy and Juniper. The women are now quite elderly and still living inthe castle and the story begins to alternate between the two time frames.<br /><br />This book is very much a modern Gothic. There is a castle, a love affair, a sister who is mentally unbalanced, a missing fianc&eacute;e, a few stormy nights and secrets, secrets, secrets.  Morton is quite adept at switching back and forth between the two story lines and ever so slowly peels back all the layers of the tale.  It is at times creepy, moving and sometimes shocking.  It seemed as if every time I knew where the story was going the author would shift it off into another direction.<br /><br />The title The Distant Hours doesn't just refer to the story in the past but also is an inference to Edie and Meredith's relationship, which has never been close, and a relationship that Edie is hoping to repair by discovering the truth about her mother's past. In doing so she begins to also figure out a little about herself.<br /><br />The rating of 4 stars reflects the fact that the book was a bit slow moving and the back-story took a little too long to set up.<br /><br />Overall an entertaining read.g and the back-story took a little too long to set up.

0307474712|4.0|\\"One Day\\" reminded me a bit of the play \\"Love Letters,\\" and also of \\"The Time Traveler's Wife.\\" The book chronicles the unorthodox friendship between Emma Dexter, two very different people who meet each other at the end of their college careers. Although never becoming officially romantically involved, Dex and Em keep in touch as their lives go in very different directions. I really enjoyed this book, especially the latter half, and the ending really shocked me...I did NOT see it coming. Unfortunately the story is a bit slow going in the beginning, which is why I can't give the book five stars. However, I very much enjoyed it and will seek out additional books by this author.

0307593495|5.0|A little over a year ago I received, read and reviewed The Man From Beijing by Henning Mankell for the Vine program. I gave it five stars and was so impressed with Mr. Mankell's abilities that I immediately purchased one of his Kurt Walllander novels. The Troubled Man might well be described as the story of Kurt Wallander's last case, for in it the detctive is coping with the onset of his own old age, dementia, and losses as well as attempting to solve a case at hand.  Characters from earlier novels who were significant in Wallander's life make return appearances either as real people, such as Wallander's ex wife, or in memory such as his deceased father and in each case some sort of resolution of the relationship is accomplished.  It speaks much of Mankell's skills that if it is a character that was in that earlier novel he or she was so well drawn that they quickly return to memory as old acquaintances, and if they were in a book yet unread I was drawn to read that book.  As in all excellent novels, The Troubled Man, drew me in quickly and kept me enthralled to the end, an end that I was sorry to reach as I missed being with the characters.     The Troubled Man is also the story of a mystery.  As such it is well plotted held my attention to the end and, if in the end, it does not supply all answers, it supplies enough answers to satisfy.      I recommend this book wholeheartedly to one and all.  I purposely have omitted a summary of its plot and suggest you avoid all such summaries letting Henning Mankeell tell his story in his own way.
B00012FXAE|5.0|How can I start off with this movie that I can't do justice Aliens from 1986 big hit directed by James Cameron he directed The Terminator 2 years prior he'd go on to direct Terminator 2 True Lies Avatar among many others. Stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, Michael Biehn as Corperal Hicks, Lance Henriksen as Bishop Bill Paxton as Hudson, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez, Paul Raiser as Carter Burke Carrie Henn as Newt, Al Matthews as Sargent Apone & William Hope as Liutenant Gorman. Story is 57 years after Alien Ripley has just been floating out there in space she was finally found by the company & a man named Carter Burke befrinds Ripley. Also in the special edition you find out that she had a daughter & that she was married & that she had died 2 years ago & that helps with the movie later on. So the suits at the company aren't happy with Ripley she blew up there expensive ship (Well you guys can buy a new 1) Ripley has her flight licence revoked by the company & we find out that the place where The Nostromo landed in Alien is now a colony called LV 426. Also a scene put back in the film is where we are introduced to Rebecca Jordan or Newt a girl & her family basically her Mother & Father go into the Boneship her Father gets facehugged by & The Colony is attacked from there. Burke tries to get Ripley to go with him to LV 426 cause they have of course sent out a distress signal. He also tries to sweeten the deal telling her that he will get her flight licence back. She continally has these nightmares so she agrees to go \\"Just tell me 1 thing Burke were going there to destroy these things not to bring back & study but wipe them out?\\" Then we are introduced to the Colonial Marines Corperal Hicks Privet Vasquez Privet Hudson Sargent Apone Lieutentant Gorman. These characters are so bad a   s   s rememberable you remember these characters a year after watching it even 10 years after watching it they aren't forgettable you don't forget these great characters like you dothe characters in The AVP movies like in a day. Funny interaction like Hudson \\"Hey Vasquez do you ever get mistaken for a man?\\" Vasquez:\\"No do you?\\" Funny stuff like Bisop with the knife. Ripley finds out that Bisop is a Company Android she isn't happy of course because of what happend last time. They go down to LV 426 to look around Hudson funniest character of this movie tells Ripley \\"We got Pulse Rifles Tatical Nukes guns knives sharp sticks! State of the art bad   azz!\\" When they get there they just see all this aftermath of what the Aliens did then they find this girl Newt & of course Ripley become a Motherly type figure for her. They find out there are civillans around but they have all been cocooned. There is this 1 colonist that is still alive & when that Chestburster comes out Sigourney Weaver just sells it. Pulse Rifles could blow the reactor so they can't use them Hicks pulls his shot gun out great line \\"Better keep this for close encounters.\\" The Marines get pwnd Vietnam style The Alien got Sargent Apone & some of the others Drake is killed when they make it to the vehicle as the door closes an Alien tries to get in Hicks blows it's head off with his shot gun the vehicle tears an axel. Ripley suggest to blow the planet. Burke takes up for the company Hudson:\\" Maybe you haven't kept up with current events pal we just got our a  s s e s kicked!\\" Somebody is going to try & fly them out of there but she is attacked by an Alien while she is flying it & it crashes. of course we get a classic line by Hudson \\"Game Over Man GAME OVER!\\" No 1 can forget Newt's line \\" They come out at night most of the time.\\" Also in the special edition you get the Sentery Gun scene   Hicks is now in charge  & while they are looking at the situation he says it could take 17 weeks until a rescue team comes & gets them. Hudson:\\"Aww man we haven't go 17 hours!\\" Ripley:\\" This girl survived longer!\\" Hudson:\\" Oh why don't you put her in charge!\\"  Hicks & Ripley have some strong scenes together he also teaches her how to use the Pulse Rifle. You find out that Burke is trying to get a specimen for the company. He also set up all the civillans to die. While Ripley & Newt are asleep Ripley hears a Facehugger Burke took her Pulse Rifle the door is locked she sets off the sprinklers. to alert the Marines Hicks & Hudson kill the 2 Facehuggers. Then they confont BurkeI just want Michael Biehn to beat Paul Reiser to de a t  h. The Aliens cut the power which then we get a very action packed finish with Hudson being killed Burke tries to trap them but he's taken by an Alien. Also a special feature on The Alien Antholgy you find out he has been cocooned so it was filmed. Newt shows them the ventalation shaft wher they escape Vasquez & Gorman are fighting off The Aliens. They get hurt then they sacrifice themeselves & then we get a great scene Vasquez says \\"You always an a  s    s  whole Gorman.\\" newt fell into a sewage area they try to get her but she grabbed by an Alien. Then on the elavator a Alien trys to stop the door Hicks shoots it with his Pulse Rifle acid goes on him they make it to the ship so Hicks can get medical care Ripley is going to save Newt she gets armed to the teeth. Also in the special edition we get an added scene where Hicks tells her don't take to long they tell each other there 1st names which is nice since they never contiued his caracter or Newt's. Ripley goes down to the nest which were introduced to The Queen Alien this is similar to a bee hive or an ant colony. She gets to Newt she blows the nest all the way to he  l  l. shoots every Alien in sight they make it up to the surface Bishop arrives just in time. Ripley & Bishop are talking then The Alien Queen sticks it's tail into Bishop rips him into half. We of course get the rememberable Power Loader scenegreat stuff & the greatest line ever \\"Get away from her YOU B! T C  H!\\" Ripley tosses her out of the Air Lock. It ends great. Newt:\\" Can I dream now?\\" Ripley:\\"All the way home.\\" Ifthis had been the last Alien movie it would've been the best way to end IMO. This had to be James Cameron's best movie I don't know why he said The Queen would've been better if it was CGI. Great score by James Horner. This was Sigourney Weaver's best perfomance by far she was even nominated for an Academy Award. Michael biehn was great shamer he never got to be a big star. Bill Paxton was great almost stole the show for me. Lance Henriksen is extremly undrrated too as is Jennette Goldstein. Carrie Henn good for a 1st time role her only role too & she didn't annoy me. Paul Reiser was good as the corperate suit. His turn was a better suprise than Topher Grace's in a certain movie. I'll get to that 1 later. Next we go to the jungle.
B004L49K20|5.0|I've been a longtime fan of the band since I was little kid, but I was astonished that at this stage in their career, the boys were able to put together one of...if not their greatest albums of all time!  This record has it all.  Despite a lot of other people's opinions I was quite impressed with the \\"Fab Five's\\" return on Astronaut and thought it was a great warm-up for even greater things to follow. Sadly though, we were given RCM which was very much out of their element as well as the second departure of Andy Taylor.  I guess if you liked electronica music and club beats, RCM was great in that respect, but it just wasn't signature Duran Duran. The organic instruments were sadly missing and that's what makes their sound.    Fast forward 4 years later and here we have All You Need is Now! Arguably one of their greatest works from start to finish.  With producer Mark Ronson on board, the band had themselves a guy who delivered on his promise and that was to return to their roots and they returned in grand fashion!     I love every song on this album aside from \\"Other People's Lives\\" and the awkward interlude \\"Diamond in the Mind\\", but for me the highlights are: \\"Safe\\", \\"Girl Panic\\", \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\" & \\"Leave A Light On.\\"  If you were lucky enough to grab the special edition package from Best Buy as I was, you will be treated to the 2 bonus tracks \\"Too Close to the Sun\\" and \\"Early Summer Nerves.\\"  Both are great additions to the album and give the fans more for their money.  \\"Networker Nation\\" is also a fun listen, which sounds like it could have been off of RCM but still it works with the rest of the new songs.    The DVD included in the deluxe edition is also a nice complimentary piece that gives the fans a peak into the songwriting process for each of the main tracks and commentary by each of the four members of the band.  A nice bonus to an already incredible package!     This is the record that fans have been waiting to hear since Rio and I'm sure will lend some new modern classics for the band to perform in concert. If you haven't bought this album yet, go out and get it and support the boys for a job well done! Move over U2...Duran Duran have re-applied for the Best Band in the World!!!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Until buying these discs, I had never seen the show, and knew almost nothing about it. Based on one recommendation from a friend and an above average blurb in Entertainment Weekly, I took a chance. Best DVD purchase ever. I love this show! Yeah, every character is a cliche, and no community college is really like this, but that's all just a ruse to make you think it's a generic comedy... but the characters are so much more three-dimensional than the initial viewing implies. Do yourself a favor and go back to Community college for as long as they'll have you.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say that I am a fan of RED. I loved all the action and the actors. There were so many great parts that I kept rewinding the DVD to see them again. I loved the scene where Bruce Willis' character gets out of the police car (I won't spoil it for you). I will be adding this movie to my collection.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS SERIES IS THAT MY HUSBAND AND I OWN IT AND THE PURCHASE WE MADE RECENTLY AT AMAZON.COM WAS A GIFT FOR ONE OF OUR SONS.  THE SERIES IS VERY WORTHWHILE WATCHING, IS A VERY TOP NOTCH PRODUCTION AND THE CONTENT IS AMAZING.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I was somewhat disappointed with the first two DVD's from Rachel Brice, simply because I wanted more.  I have since come to appreciate that the technique she offered was more than worth the cost.  However, this DVD is beyond all my hopes for it. Ms. Brice has generously given us a wonderful gift of her outstanding teaching for an incredibly low price. I am wondering if this is her way of showing her appreciation to her fans. I have more than 30 belly dancing DVD's and use many of them often. But, since purchasing this DVD about a month ago... it is the only one I use. Every morning I jump out of bed, push the play button and start right in. It is truly \\"all that\\". Thanks Rachel!
B002ZG9774|5.0|I am not a big C.A. or Cher fan, but the songs and the upbeat feel of the movie won me over. Great entertainment.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|*** USE EXTREME CAUTION***  After following all the directions for installing the Amazon App onto my phone, then trying to install the Angry Birds app itself onto my phone, the only thing that ended up happening was my 16g SD card was completely wiped out and all of the pictures, video's, music, etc were gone. I even tried reformatting the card as directed to start fresh and that also couldn't happen. Brought my SD card to Verizon and they said that this has been a issue with downloading 3rd party apps to Android phones. Good news was that I was able to get my SD card replaced for free. Bad news was that all my information that was stored on the original card was now gone for good.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I've been addicted to Angry Birds from the moment I downloaded it. This is brilliant and charming game and quite possibly the best mobile game period. I'm happy to show my continued support and get an ad-free version to boot. Worth every penny.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|The thing is a bit rigid for a name like \\"flex\\", but it was exaclty what I was looking for.  To my surprise, the price is very close to the one without the extention arm.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I had these for probably 2 weeks before they started giving me problems. The mic boom broke and would not stay in a locked position other than down which was thanks to gravity and my big head. Second, I babied these and one day while pulling them off my head the wire came out of the ear hole. Don't waste your money. Go with logitech!
1416972242|5.0|You really want to know what's next.  I read it in two days.  The author did a great job describing the characters, the places and of course I love the sarcastic comments, it's funny and sexy.  I'm just a big fan of these books.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe Bonamassa continues to top himself with each release. As much as I loved Black Rock and the albums that preceded it, I do believe Dust Bowl to be his finest work. The songs are great and Joe is clearly growing into a very capable vocalist. Of course, the highlight is his superior guitar playing. The man is amazing. I also love the production of this album. The bass guitar and drums boom while Joe tears up every song on guitar. If you are a fan of blues rock with first class musicianship and no corporate interference, Joe is your man. Buy Dust Bowl now!
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|My 5 year old and I both love this game.  Try the free version if you're not sure. I have gone through all 10 levels and started the game again. We like it as much as angry birds.  Lots of entertainment value for the price.  Be sure to watch the tutorial before playing, it teaches you a few things to make the game fun instead of frustrating.  In round two be sure to buy the \\"king fisher\\" bait. It makes it easier to attract and catch sharks which is a challenge and a blast.<br /><br />Money well spent for me. Hours of entertainment for less than $5.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Let me first say, that this movie, or documentary about the buildup and fallout (or bailout) of the financial crises of 2008 is, compared to other documentaries perhaps a high 3 or 4, but something that everybody in the world should watch, since the world is becoming increasing financialized and this has effects around the globe.  So the 5 in my view is a rating for its social imperative-ness and import of the issues discussed in the film.      The team that made the movie does a good job of getting their facts straight and conveying them to the audience in a fairly straightforward and easy to understand manner on some things that aren't so easy to get your head around (if you don't already have some association with finance), like CDOs, credit default swaps, and securitization.  There are also interviews with industry insiders who aren't corrupt, which gives credibility to the movie.  Some of the cinematography was nicely done, too, and nicely captured New York and the surrounding areas.         I've followed finance pretty closely for the past 10 years and the way that this movie put everything together just kind of made me think how finance has got their way in America and that the line between the power elite in private industry and government is basically blurred or non-existent.  What's more, and I didn't fully realize the extent of it, was academia's complicity in fueling the machine, acting as experts in trials, advertisements, and articles, while really just lining their own pockets, touting the line they are paid to tout.  But really almost everybody down the line was complicit.      Some of the things I observed that could have been done better:  first, obviously some people took loans that they couldn't afford and knowingly did so.  The movie never places blame on these people, and to be fair, it should.  Second, there is not a whole lot of discussion of Fannie and Freddie--part of the reason that you had these people who couldn't afford their loans getloans was legislation passed in the 1990s that made it easier for Americans to get home loans, in the hope that they would become home owners.  Third, they should have made clear that the real issue here was only with OTC or over the counter derivatives, not exchange-traded derivatives, the latter of which are highly regulated contracts transacted on central exchanges.      The third point gets to something else, which is that if the makers of the movie had been financial professionals themselves, we would get a lot more in-depth picture of how deep all of this goes, but they weren't industry insiders, or at least the director wasn't, and he mentioned on the bonus material about his research.  What really gets me about the whole crisis since 2008 is the whole seat of the pants mentality of the thing, which for me, there are more questions than answers.  Things like, why did the Fed give a loan to JP Morgan to help bail out Bear Sterns but Lehman is left to fail?  Why was the first proposal of the $700 billion taxpayer bailout that was delivered to Congress only one page long?  What is the long term goal of providing liquidity to banks if they're not going to lend it, but just use it for trading?      It 's also interesting to note that Goldman Sachs had 0 (yes that's zero) trading loss days in, for example, Q1 2010.  This isn't an anomaly and other firms had similar performances over the past several quarters.  This gets at another academic finance myth, the efficient market hypothesis, where markets are either semi- or totally random, which would make the probability of winning approximately 63 out of 63 trading days probabilistically nearly impossible.  I guess this is another movie in itself, but the whole thing is so disgusting and would be even more so if we hadn't been bombarded with the images and stories over the past 4 years or so.
B00454U1O2|5.0|Love this CD-I purchased the \\"clean\\" version so I wouldn't be afraid of my 4 yr old hearing it but only the \\"F\\" word is blanked out...the radio versions are the cleaner versions. Thanks goodness I listened before she did because other inappropriate words are loud and clear on the CD. I've had great fun rocking out to the CD however... just by myself!
B004M8KLYQ|5.0|PJ Harvey's eighth studio album, Let England Shake, is a work of art. She recorded the album in a 19th century church in Dorset, located on the South West coast of England. Joining her in the studio were longtime friends and collaborators Mick Harvey (no relation) and John Parish and producer Flood.<br /><br />In numerous interviews Polly Jean Harvey states that her goal with each album is for it to be different than the previous, and in that she is far more successful than her peers. The goth-electro foreboding of 1998's Is This Desire? gave way to 2000's pure rock Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea, an album for which she won the Mercury Prize. 2007's White Chalk was also critically lauded and for this album Harvey ditched her Gretsch Broadkaster for the piano. While the instruments and the overall sound of each album differs from one to the next you could say that each of these albums dealt with the inner world and subjects ranged from subjects like unrequited love to death to sex; the personal politics and torments and joys that make us human. On Let England Shake, Harvey places the personal politics aside and focuses on the outside world. Images of war and its impact on the land are a common subject matter here with allusion to both Afghanistan and World War I, however, the music shifts the overall tone of the song so that the album does not feel heavy handed. To put it bluntly, Harvey does not preach to her listeners, which is unique for such a political album.<br /><br />Final Impressions : If you are as much a fan of PJ Harvey as I am then this album will not disappoint. If you are a lover of music...this album is worth the cost. It is already receiving critical praise.

Jackson star<br />in Barry Levinson's 1998 sci-fi film based on the book.<br />A team of scientists find an ancient spacecraft and<br />encounter an alien entity in the form of a giant ball.<br />This is a pretty good sci-fi flick and the cast is<br />great. This dvd has nice picture and sound plus<br />commentary, the trailer, tv spots & visual<br />effects featurette. I recommend this.
B004J5366M|5.0|Early in the Morning is a work of art...suitable for listening in its entirety rather than picking apart and adding single tracks to a playlist. Songs flow from one to the next and his voice shifts from a sensual sincerity on songs such as \\"Breaking Hearts\\" to soaring to unexpected heights on tracks like \\"From the Woods.\\" McMorrow cites writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Steinbeck as influences, and this can be heard in songs like \\"This Old Dark Machine.\\" Overall, my ears give McMorrow's debut two thumbs up.

B0012NO316|1.0|Then watch this movie. If you don't have enough marital discord and vicious fighting in your life, watch this. If you like scenes where two married people wait on the front porch while their spouses cheat upstairs (nothing graphic), watch this. If you like watching people drink (actors drinking fake drinks) for 24+ hours straight with no other food or other beverages, and stagger around the yard mumbling, then this is the movie for you. If you like having to strain to hear what they're saying, even better. If you love two hours and 15 minutes of unabated misery, in dismal black and white, then this movie is for you! If you like feeling dragged in to their ugliness and feel ugly yourself when you're done, then you will love this movie. Enjoy!
B00275EHJQ|3.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew...not sure why this has been the only movie that has not played in their blu ray player...I exchanged it for another and had the same issue.  All other blu rays play fine except this one...it might just have something to do with the player itself (Samsung)
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Great application and works well. It is, however, not worth $5 unless you want to support the developers. Soundhound is a great free application that accomplishes the same thing. All price tags aside it is a solid application.

0679882820|3.0|I read this to my 1 yr old daughter.The sounds are fun and she enjoys them. She generally gets hooked to all other colorful books I read to her but not this one. The cartoon in the book is not exactly what you would expect to find in a book for toddlers. Its rather what you would find in a comic but what else could you expect for the price.I read the book and she keeps looking at me. Its nice to have that kind of attention from a 1 yr old but now I just make those noises and dont need the book anymore.
B004G6009K|5.0|First of all, I just want to say that I *LOVE* this movie!  It has become my all time favorite Disney movie.  But there are other reviews that go into more detail about the movie's strengths/weaknesses.  That being said, I just wanted to point out that the Four Disc Combo set case I received in the mail today states that the Blu-Ray 3D disc requires a special 3D Blu-Ray player, 3D TV, \\"compatible\\" 3D glasses (not provided), and some kind of special cable.  I was mistakenly under the impression that the 3D version of the movie would be playable on my ordinary Blu-Ray player and TV, and that it would come with 3D glasses like other 3D movies I've purchased before have... but this was not the case.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not complaining- a 3-disc combo for this price is still a steal, and I now have the 3D version for if/when I decide to upgrade.  I just wanted to make sure that these requirements for the 3D disc were clear, since they are not anywhere in the description.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Wow the classic which I love in Blu-Ray - looks great on a BIG LED HDTV with Blu-Ray - just turn down the lights and turn up the digital soundtrack and enjoy....a classic brought to digital life!!
B0006L0LOS|4.0|I think this movie was actually a good movie, it had its moments were it was a bit odd, but I enjoyed it and so have my kids. I just think critics gave it such a bad reputation because of the box office performance and because it wasn't what they expected. Whatever the reason this movie is not bad as critics made it out to be. 4 stars!!
0446563048|5.0|For those who want to learn how collaborative leadership can transform into personal and corporate growth and development, Tony Hsieh's book is a must read.  The author's open-minded approach and bold unselfishness to business decisions are characteristics that greatly impact his many successes.  American and global corporations may find that the evolving Zappos culture is one to emulate in some form or part if they want to continue to experience lasting success for their stakeholders.  His witty writing style surely made the reading very easy to absorb.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|First time I saw this (100 years ago), I wouldn't get in the bathtub for 3 months.  It's still a great \\"anti-ocean\\" film.  Now, I'm older and wiser... and willing to take a bath!  (But I'm still not getting in the ocean).
0756407125|5.0|I must disagree with the few negative reviews I have seen of this work, which seem to view minor quibbles in a masterpiece as a reason to demote two stars.  Their expectations are so insanely high due to the quality of the first book that, when they encounter the same astounding quality they are disappointed.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear is fantasy at its finest.  I will be re-reading it as I did the Name of the Wind.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|LOVED this whole series and could not wait to watch it again when this boxed set came out.  However, the last disc of the final season with the final two episodes cannot be viewed as there is obviously a manufacturing defect.  Amazon have replaced my set twice and all three sets received had this same problem.  I even tried the last disc on another DVD player in my house and it still had the problem.  Obviously, my DVD players are just fine as they played all the other discs in the boxed set with no problem.  As of today's date, Amazon still have no resolution for this problem except to keep sending out new boxed sets!  VERY disappointing, particularly given the significance of the last two episodes!
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|I remembered hearing about this incident and about a month or so ago watched the special segment (either 48 hours or 20/20) and was perplexed by Aron's account of what he experienced.  The segment talked about the entire incident and took you back (on a factual basis) of what happened.<br /><br />The movie was OK and while I knew it was not a documentary, it dragged on and on.  Perhaps, I was spoiled by hearing the \\"live details.\\"  Anyway, the movie is entertaining but misses out of some key elements such as the toil Aron had to endure during the 127 hours, as well as the 4 hour trek to get back to civility.....once he decided to cut off his arm.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is so unreal for the price I am amazed I went from running 57 degrees C while encoding a Blu-ray at full load with stock cooler on a phenom II X6 1090t all 6 cores running at max to 40 C or 104 F that's almost 20 C just unreal and the price was so good I bought some Arctic Silver 5 even though this comes with thermal paste and I am sure it is good stuff but I wanted the best I will use the cooler master paste to put my Northbridge heat sink back on if it ever gets hot enough to worry about. Also this is the best fit ever it clears everything and is as big as it can be and fit in the case you can't get bigger for less money and nothing can touch it performance for the dollar. The reason my Northbridge cooler was taken off was to fit another cooler that was more expensive not as good and would not clear the ram this clears everything but if you had some huge heat sinks on your ram it could make trouble such as ripjaws or other ram with huge heat sinks but mine just have normal size heat spreaders and it clears them with room to spare. I want this cooler on everything I own
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|Here's the main thing to know; if you like Amon Amarth's old stuff, you'll like this unless you're extremely picky.  The overall sound is similar to most of their albums, with some slight alterations to keep things interesting.  The songs offer mostly mid-paced to slower melodic, powerhouse riffs, with plenty of speed thrown in, albeit slightly less than I seem to remember from previous albums.  Surtur Rising goes for a more sorrowful, melancholic feel than Twilight of the Thunder God, with a more crisp style of melody that brings to mind influences from NWOBHM more than Gothenburg.  I also notice more breaks into atmospheric, mellow, sometimes acoustic clean passages, which are short but effective in enhancing the mood of the album.  Even though this isn't Thunder God Part 2, it isn't all that much different from their past work, and you'll find plenty of  thundering Swedish death metal and double bass to keep things from getting too safe.<br /><br />As for individual highlights, Destroyer of the Universe, For Victory or Death, and Slaves of Fear are my favorites.  Slaves of Fear is too catchy, with an awesome, infectious melodic riff that shifts into old-school death metal brutality.  This is the one that will get stuck in your head and make you NEED to put in the cd.  For Victory or Death features an intro that highlights that more atmospheric, sorrowful side, then bursts into a traditional Amon Amarth gallop.  Destroyer of the Universe, predictably, has a little extra punch and is one of those stomping power metal songs.  These are by no means the only great tracks, just a few that stand out.<br /><br />Some will probably say that Surtur Rising sounds just the same as their other albums, or that it offers nothing new.  To that, I'd say that familiarity can be a good thing for bands if they avoid sounding complacent, as in just rehashing their old songs.  I think Amon Amarth does avoid that by writing energetic songs that are new-sounding despite the familiarity.  Plus, Twilight of the Thunder God was a crushing album, so Surtur slows things down a bit, offers a small change of pace instead of doing the same album again.  I'm not sure if some people are looking for keyboards, or opera singing, or orchestras (which they actually do use sparingly on two tracks!), but I like my Amon Amarth exactly how they are.  My opinion is, if it's not broke, don't make it all experimental and \\"push the boundaries\\" just to keep the critics happy.of the Thunder God was a crushing album, so Surtur slows things down a bit, offers a small change of pace instead of doing the same album again.

My opinion is, if it's not broke, don't make it all experimental and \\"push the boundaries\\" just to keep the critics happy.

B003UESJFG|5.0|I bought this movie for my two sons: age 9 & age 2. They both love it but my husband and I do as well. There are lots of recognizable celebrity voices and there are funny parts for adults too! We all really enjoy this movie!
0756404738|5.0|This book did not disappoint. There were a few times here and there where I was extremely worried that Rothfuss was getting so off track that we would become lost in a sea of subplots and characters ala Robert Jordan and now dangerously J.V. Jones in Song of Ice and Fire, but Rothfuss managed to reel things back in by the end and tie it together.  I am hopeful that the third installment can come out a bit quicker this time as it was very long wait between the first two.    If you like the first one, you will like this a great deal as well.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney Spears has been in the music business for more than a decade. She has a successful pop resume that others attempt to emulate: churning chart topping hits, performing around the globe, setting music and internet records, and for a time, filling the wallets of paparazzi everywhere during her highly publicized personal crisis. So it comes as no surprise that after her revitalizing Circus Tour, the Pop Princess and her team was ready to hit the radio waves with their latest.<br /><br />Femme Fatale, in Ms. Spears own words, \\"speaks for itself.\\" By definition, this seventh studio album is mysterious, intriguing, darker, and revives Britney's temptress lolita persona of yesteryear. Like past efforts, Femme Fatale is slightly more a testimony to Britney's assembled team of hit makers than it is the starlet herself. It is packed with amazing production by the likes of Will.i.am, Darkchild, and Billboard with the return of the powerhouses responsible for the infectious lead single \\"Hold It Against Me\\" (Dr. Luke and Martin) and \\"Piece of Me\\" (Bloodshy). Britney continues to keep current with \\"Till the World Ends\\", a club chanting track penned by Ke$ha.<br /><br />The electronic and club friendly tracks in Femme Fatale reminds this reviewer of everything the Rolling Stone-praised \\"Blackout\\" was intended to be. Its energetic sound will get you moving during your next workout routine or primed for the night out. Femme Fatale offers lovers of dance, techno, and pop music alike something unique. From the dubstep teasing \\"Hold it Against Me\\" to R&B infused and bass crackling \\"Inside Out\\" and \\"Big Fat Bass\\", or maybe the Eurosynth whistle of \\"I Wanna Go\\" or the thump of \\"Drop Dead (Beautiful)\\" are more your thing. Whether it's the delicious bubble gum pop of \\"How I Roll\\", the pop-rock fuse in \\"Don't Keep me Waiting\\" or the retro sound in \\"Seal it with a Kiss\\", each track adds something to the LP.<br /><br />Unlike Blackout, Britney's voice is clearer of the robotic quality, and she sounds more present. And also unlike Blackout, there seems to be a fresh confidence to Britney, whose internet snippets and promotions for Femme Fatale had this reviewer foaming at the mouth for more. Just check her (body) out in Out magazine and try not to stare.<br /><br />So call Femme Fatale an ode to Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" or \\"Blackout 2.0\\". But you can't this call it a comeback. This Queen of Pop never went anywhere. There is an image and a formula that has worked for her, and she once again embraces her trademarketable femme fatale persona (and coital moans) that rocketed her to stardom. Femme Fatale's drawback would be its lack of introspective lyrics and Britney's personalization. She and her team haven't reach that adult stage of development.<br /><br />In the mean time, enjoy what could possibly be one of the biggest pop albums of 2011. That is, until Lady Gaga comes in like an insolent child craving more attention.resent.

0756405890|5.0|Couldn't put it down. That's about the best compliment I can find for any book.  When I stay up late late at night so that I can keep reading a book I know it was a great one.  Rothfuss has created a wonderful world of magic and great depth of character.  The first volume started off a bit predictable but that is hard to fault.  There are only so many ways to deal with a lone boy brought up in the world and pretty much all of them have been done before.  Rothfuss' style of prose makes it interesting to follow the lead character despite the fact that some of the beginning is a bit predictable.  By the end however, he reels you in completely.    Great book and a fantastic start to a series.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This was a great movie in the theater and a great DVD. I love the use of AC/DC and Guns N Roses as Megamind's theme music, and I loved his development. I also like how Hal's quirk bassoon theme transitions into the disturbing Titan theme. The commentary was quite enlightening about the whole process.     This is one of those watch over and over films because there are so many in jokes and quirky things in the background.

0060936223|5.0|There was a time. A time when talent and creativity streamed amongst the common folk of New York City with such quiet force that decades later, America still is not sure what it meant, but hopefully senses somehow, like native New Yorker Walt Whitman once wrote, \\"But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood.\\"<br /><br />Just Kids is an inside out first person story of Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe. It is a told history of New York City in the late Sixties. It is some of the most beautiful, direct language I have read in a very long time.<br /><br />Patti Smith has written an incredibly touching tribute to life loves and friendship, which coincidentally is history, culture and high art.<br /><br />\\"Love is the miracle.\\" --Patti Smith
0142405809|5.0|This book, and others by Julia Donaldson are wonderful read aloud books.  My grandson (4 years old) loves the way the author has fun with words and the story.  The illustrator, Axel Scheffler, creates beautiful scenes with little creatures and interesting details that encourage kids to find new things on each page with every reading. Other books we enjoy include \\"Gruffalo\\", \\"Grufalo's Child\\", and \\"Room on the Broom\\".

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have an Uppababy stroller, with a slanted handle. The straps of this cupholder grip the handles well and don't slide down. The bottom of the holder is rigid, so it doesn't become floppy when a cup's not in it. There's a zippered mesh pocket on the inside, great for keeping cash from flying out, and you can see what's in there. The two cup pockets are slightly elasticated at the top so they fit cups of different size with enough grip to keep them from flying out, but not so much that you have to yank to get your cup out to drink. The center section is spacious enough to hold my sunglass case, wallet, keys, phone, and pocket camera. I am 100% happy with this product.
B004SBX112|4.0|I was really excited to finally get ad-free versions of these games! Definitely worth a buck, or free if you got it on the right day. Unfortunately, there are ads in the pause menu. The ads that covered the game screen are gone, but still. Not technically ad-free.
006621131X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother, who had a similar, passionate and close friendship with another artist. I delayed giving her the book for several weeks, because I couldn't bear to part with it. How rare to find a rock star who is so great a poet, so vulnerable, so authentic, so sincere, so selfless. I treasure her and marvel at her generosity and courage in sharing this intimate part of her life with the world. So grateful for her, and for this book.
B000UPQFEA|4.0|With vivid, high impact sound, effective interpretations, and exciting orchestral execution, Rattle provides an excellent first set of the Sibelius Seven. I deducted one star because the total is shy of the sum of its parts: sound occasionally has a digital coarseness (these are late 80s EMI recordings) and because Rattle's podium exertions can strike me sometimes more as rhetorical experimentation than real inspiration (I feel similarly about Bernstein).  The hallmark of these symphonies, and the music of Sibelius in general, is mood and atmosphere, and while Rattle can generate sweep and loads of excitement, other conductors are better at reading Sibelius' poetic pulse, for example, Beecham, or more recently Segerstam.  The Second symphony comes across less cogently than many other versions (hard to beat Ormandy Philadelphia 1957 for sound and presentation) and I was swept away but not enchanted by my favorite symphony, number six.  I would refer the diehard Sibeliusophile to read Richard A. Kaplan in Fanfare magazine, January February 2007 issue, for a very thoughtful and exhaustive comparison of recorded versions of these great works.
1596680296|4.0|This book is a comprehensive reference with many iterations per sock -- so you'll have:    plain ribbed sock   in sizes for toddler, child, teen, adult S, M, L, etc.   in fingering, dk, worsted, chunky, etc.    lace sock in all sizes, weights    anklet sock in all sizes, weights    Then in each section it will give you a few different stitch patterns, so it'll be 4, 6, 8-st repeats for rib, for lace, etc. The patterns are written out with enough detail that an intermediate  or advanced-beginner knitter (which is what I consider myself) could just pick out the combination of style, size, and yarn weight to suit materials at hand and make some very credible socks right off the bat. A more skilled knitter could use these as a template for lots of innovation.    It explains the basics concepts of how purl/knit boundaries create draw-in or stretchiness, and how you can use a stretchier yarn to make up for lack of draw-in in your stitch pattern. It is targeted to the top-down, dpn, heel-flap knitter, however. If you prefer toe-up, magic loop or 2 circs, or short-row heels, you will need to do some work to adapt these patterns. I would have given it five stars if the book had done that work for you, but then it would probably be double the price. My only other slight peeve is that the photos have a sort of 80s look to them, but I understand that they are not meant to inspire with exotic designs and lush photography, they are mean to show details very clearly for instructional purposes.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Jennifer Hudson has done it. All by herself. Brought back the classic and timeless R&B sound that has been missing for over a decade. Auto-tune? No thank you, techno beat? Are you kidding? None of that was on this album. Why? BECAUSE SHE CAN ACTUALLY SING! After listening to this cd I pass the \\"best singer of our generation\\" crown to her. I am one of the hardest people to please with when it comes to music and she just blew me away. You can put it in and just let it play. Don't have to skip to your favorite song...they all have great melody, meaning and THAT VOICE to go with it. I was not crazy about \\"Where you at\\" (until she \\"delivers at the end) and was a little worried about this cd. I shouldn't have been. This will be one of my all time favorite cd's. Songs with substance. That is what music is supposed to be about. I am only in my 20's so this is not coming from an old era. Jennifer. Thank you for saving R&B and my ears :) BRAVO!    Best songs: I Got This, I remember me, No ones gonna love you, Don't look down.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought this for use on documentaries, as a primary microphone and audio recorder for use with a 7D. It is perfect for my minuscule budget, and if you can get the microphone close enough to the subject, the sound quality is surprisingly good. When screening my dailies in class, people generally were surprised that I was using just the Zoom's own microphone (interviews conducted inside a fairly quiet apartment). This can be set to two different pickup patterns, depending on how you rotate the microphones, but I didn't notice much difference between them. The only problem I have noticed, which is very much a user problem but still, could have been avoided by a small design change, is that the button you hit to record works a little differently than you might expect. You press it once to start reading levels, then again to start recording. I have more than once failed to press it a second time, because I am used to thinking that red button=record. If you read the manual and pay attention, you'll be fine.
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones is a tight book in a large package. The scenes are precisely executed so that the reader knows every scene is written for a purpose. The ends of every chapter are works of art that keep you going not only into the next piece, but on through that to see what twist he will leave you with next. His characters grab you right from the gate, showing you this will be an emotional ride that doesn't fail to deliver right to the end. Even his minor characters always have something special about them that fills the void with such pleasurable ambiance that you don't want to leave his world. The passion behind each house is so real and yet set apart that even the most vile still have a human side that makes you both despise and empathize. George uses both emotions to strengthen your attachment to the heroes and yet not everyone will agree on which House most deserves to rule. Revealing a powerful sense of touch, George sometimes goes over the line for those who prefer romance to stay behind closed doors, but other than that this book was a Fantasy champion.

0756404738|4.0|Tavern owner Kote continues narrating his exploits to the Chronicler in \\"The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two)\\".  Other than a few chapter breaks in his storytelling, Kvothe's focuses on his first couple years at the University and adventures during an extended hiatus from learning.  The strongest aspect of the writing has to be the characterization.  During what could be boring moments by others authors I found to be riveting material.  Kvothe's clever dialogue displays his intelligence when struggling through the engrossing challenges in his life.<br /><br />Magic is well done and with greater detailed than the prior novel.  The antagonists menace Kvothe mercilessly as he progresses on his search for the demonic Chandrian (unfortunately little is learned about them).  While many times being a victim of circumstances, his cavalier demeanor opens him up for trouble.  Although he is young, his frustrating relationship with Denna reminds me when someone overlooks what he could have yet pursues the unattainable.  I thought I had Bast figured out, now I'm conflicted on how I feel about him at the conclusion.  I have my theories and suspicious about Kvothe's lack of skill and hope the author fulfills my expectations for a fantastic finale.<br /><br />Some events like his court hearing are quickly covered but the encounter with Felurian is quite extensive.  Kote is telling the story of Kvothe, relating the real details to Chronicler.  With that approach, despite of how unorthodox a plot device it may be, the court hearing is already available to the public.  My largest disappointment with Kvothe is how quickly he may learn or strive to excel at certain tasks, but some of the hard earned skills he allows to drop off.  I do not like placing my own guesses into a character's reason but maybe it is his youth and naivety to the benefits of such knowledge and proficiency.<br /><br />A more detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.    Thank you.
0393338827|4.0|You know I was really drawn in by this story, especially since it was in the news for such a long period of time without the news reports going into the actual details of the situation.  Only issue I had with the book was the introduction, I believe the author could have spent some more time setting up the scene as well as outlining the characters of the book.  There are quite a few players in this book, and if you set the book down for too long you may not be able to recall exactly who each individual is and how they play into the whole scene.
0307346617|2.0|The writing was competent and the stories were interesting but every story teller lived to tell his tale so there is no suspense. We don't have enough time to get involved in the character to care that much in a tale we already know the outcome to. I enjoyed the graphic novel the Walking Dead because I never knew if a character I cared about would live to the end of the next chapter. The life on the edge heightened the relationships between the people. In world war Z before we could care a little bit it was over.

159448385X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read and a very worthy follow up to The Kite Runner.  Beautifully written and a stunning portrait of the resilience and character of women in Afghanistan.  I am very impressed as a woman with Khaled Hosseini's ability to capture what I felt were very authentic experiences of motherhood, sisterhood, friendship and love from a female perspective.  I have read female authors who do not come close to telling stories of these experiences as well.  This book is painful and heart-wrenching to read, almost to the point that it is unbearable in parts, but the humanity and love that survive through its characters' memories and hopes carry you through.   A valuable insight into life for Middle Eastern women over the past 30 years, as well as the history of the Afghan  people as a whole through this period.  A real must-read.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I love the graphics and the flying birds. It's a nice change from the ubiquitous green pigs, overall a cool factor to the game.  but the lag ruins it, not a smooth, gaming experience.

You'll gain insights into other people's behaviors and you will understand what really matters in life.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this to connect a lab equipment to the computer. I guess newer computers sometimes come without a serial port nowadays. The operating system on the computer was windows vista, and it was easy to install the driver from the cd that came with the USB to serial adapter. I have not had any trouble getting it to work.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the best calendar app I've tried, that's why it was worth paying for.  I keep discover new ways to use it, making it very versatile.  Great widgets included that have more than just display functions built in.  For example many of the Widgets have a create event on them.
B004CURZFC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie even though I haven't read the books. I think they combined several of the books into this movie, but the storyline was easy for me to follow. The storyline was kind of familiar and reminded me of Star Wars, but I still liked it. I also thought the owls looked extremely realistic.
B004LUS390|5.0|Flexible and versatile.  I've been using this app for a few months and made 30 our so fairly detailed sketches with it so far.  I found one bug with brushes that requires an occation brush setting reset.  Otherwise, the app is perfect.  Probably the most productive tool I have on my phone.
B004GNYGTI|4.0|I really enjoyed this action film. Some reviewers complain about it being unrealistic to have Angelina Jolie beating up a bunch of people, but aren't all action movies kind of unrealistic anyway? I thought the nonstop action was fun, and it kept me guessing about whether Angelina Jolie's character was good or evil.

1932907009|4.0|This book came up on a discussion of great reading for great game masters (GM).  So I picked up a copy and read it with that in mind.  There are many GMs out there who have great ideas for epic campaigns but so many of them fail, more often than not because the game peters out of energy.    This book helps a GM put his idea on paper and gives them the instructions on how to make it like a great movie, which then the players can enjoy being the main actors of.  So a great resource for GMs who want to take their campaign to the next level.

0786955716|3.0|They are tiles to help you layout your urban setting, but most of the tiles are building interiors.  I wished they had done more roofs (the only reason for 3 and not 4 stars).  Still I like how they did the box as terrain which can help fill out large areas of the table and provide a good idea of elevation.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|When compared to the books, yes all of the movies stray, but look how long the books are!  What I do, is I think of them as two separate story lines, because, with the exception of the fifth in my opinion, the movies themselves are fantastic.  The effects are good, and when I read the books now, I can't help but imagine these actors saying some of the lines.  The last movie will be the end of an era, because it is hard to argue how astonishing this series is and what it has become.  If you've seen the other movies, there's no reason to stop now!
B004CURZFC|3.0|My son enjoyed these books and wanted to see the movie, so it was rented but according to him (so not a personal review) the movie was very different from the books, but that is understandable knowing there are 3 books and 1 movie trying to cram it all in.

B00271DNP4|4.0|I hate to be repetative, but I must for my review of these movies. It is hard to take all the rich details of a thick book and squeeze it into two hours and expect it to make sense to anyone who not a fan of the books. This is just the highlights of a great series brought to film for those who want to see what, up till now, their imagination had to make up.

0786955554|4.0|If you want something other than a large battlemat, this set of tiles is a good starting spot for a DM.  Problem is 80% of the pre-printed modules you have will not use the majority of the tiles in here, and you will need 2 for most dungeons of descent size.  Still if you are looking for a way to laydown a map instead of drawing it, you can't go too wrong here.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|the update that gives you the music player makes this an awesome application. it's truely a viable alternative to iTunes. the new cloud storage is good way to save some space on the SD card.
B003S898SG|5.0|Angra again releases an album with all the elements I love about them. Metal, progressive, latin/bazilian style, harmonies, melodies, and so much more. Usually it will take me a few listens to really get into an album but this one caught me pretty quickly and I love that. Anyways, I'm going to keep it short and just say, buy this album.. Support the artist's out there and buy their albums so we can get more from them in the future!
B003R0MF1C|5.0|I too anxiously await the release of Medium's sadly, last season. And I echo kudos to everyone involved in getting and keeping it on the air: producers, directors, actors, production crews, etc. So, what's next? Our expectations are high...blow us away, soon! Also, it seems that either film or T.V. should nab this for ongoing future movies. Because this season proves how much more deeply the stories can go. The world is filled with more real-life Allison's to inspire!
0143038419|5.0|After a long time I came across a book that would just glue you to it. The writing was so honest, that it felt I was reading about myself all over the book. The dynamics of a woman's experience are expressed in such a simple but detailed way that, I guess any woman will be able to self-identify with it, instantaneously. I highly recommend the book for keeps. Its one of those books that can be referred back to again and again. Elizabeth Gilbert has done a wonderful job.

B00028HBKM|5.0|On Saturday, March 6, 2004, I attended a showing of The Passion of the Christ with a group from Salem Evangelical Lutheran Church. We had decided to make this an evangelism event with a discussion following the movie followed by a chili fellowship. A group of 50 (half guests of Salem) attended the afternoon matinee. Flyers announcing the discussion were distributed and several viewers joined us for the discussion. All in all it was a good afternoon and all involved were able to sort out thoughts and feelings following the watching of this movie.<br />In a word, the movie was breathtaking. Some scenes the audience literally jumps. The theater was quiet-one didn't hear the munching of popcorn!<br /><br />Artistically the movie portrayed the suffering as no one has seen it portrayed before. Many at the discussion admitted that it got to a point where they said to themselves, \\"Enough already!\\" One person even left the movie (but did re-join us for the discussion). My advice is to know yourself. If you feel you cannot handle violence or blood, don't go. If you do desire to see it, consider waiting until the movie is released on video or DVD and rent it-you can always stop the tape if the action becomes too intense.<br /><br />Mr. Gibson remained for the most part close to the Gospels. There are some Catholic add-ons, such as I believe Veronica wiping Jesus' face which is not found in the Gospels but is part of the chronology of the Stations of the Cross. Some thought Mary may have played too prominent a role, but she was the mother of Jesus; what mother wouldn't be there to comfort her child?<br /><br />Amazingly, I was able to understand about half the spoken dialogue (all that Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic training finally came in handy). The scenes with Pontius Pilate were interesting. Sometimes the dialogue between Pilate and the Jewish leaders was in Latin, other times in Aramaic/Hebrew. I will try to watch it again to try and detect a pattern. The subtitles were somewhat close to the Scriptures. Not knowing what translation of the English Scriptures Mr. Gibson used I cannot verify if the passages were verbatim. I did enjoy the opening scene of a black background with a verse from Isaiah in white text. It set the tone for the movie.<br /><br />There was, indeed, violence. How can there not be when a man is whipped and then crucified? Here the movie did disappoint. Having studied the Roman methods of torture and crucifixion I believe Mel Gibson held back in this area. And this might be the right call. The horrific violence that was on the screen was too much for some. Add to that the fact that the mental and emotional suffering Jesus endured weren't portrayed. (If you can stay awake through it, watch The Last Temptation of Christ and keep in mind throughout that this was a temptation as envisioned by the artist. This might give you a taste of what Jesus endured internally in this suffering.) The scene at the cross was a tad short. Mr. Gibson could have had Jesus pushing himself up gulping for breath just to give the audience a taste of the cruel discomfort on the cross. The arm being pulled did add realism to the effect just before the nail being driven through the right hand.<br /><br />The role of Pilate brings a new dimension for Christians who haven't thought too much about this man whom they name in their confessions. Mel Gibson adds a soliloquy by Pilate on truth where he asserts what he believes to be truth as he sees it. His wife, Claudia (not named in Scripture) does play a more prominent role than she does in Scripture. In the Gospels we are told she sends a messenger to her husband; in Passion she is right there through the trial giving her husband disapproving looks.<br />You will not soon lose the picture of the gleeful Romans whipping Jesus. Again, in our discussion it was pointed out that the Roman culture loved blood.<br /><br />All in all, this is not a movie you will enjoy (even if the ticket taker says, \\"Thank you. Enjoy the movie.\\"). But you will leave thinking about it and pondering it. You will want to talk to someone about it. If you do go to see it, try to go with a group planning to discuss it afterward, or schedule time for reflection afterward. One patron we met took a flyer disappointed she had to go to work.

B003EYVXTQ|2.0|OK, starting off, you see my star rating for this movie? That rating means I thought this movie has a few good points and, *gasp!*, a good deal of bad points. And I'm not a cinema elitist who disregards every blockbuster ever made and thinks every indier-than-thou flick is by default great. I rate films out of honesty, and this is what I honestly think of Winter's Bone.<br /><br />First off I can't deny this film is gorgeously shot. There's some great and nifty camera work in the movie and the scenery is just pure eye candy. I loved the opening shots and ominous, dark tone... and then the characters started talking. Seriously, the dialogue is so overblown and tacky. I was laughing at pretty much 80% of the lines spoken in the film. How this was up for Best Screenplay is against me.<br /><br />What very little plot there is relies on the protagonist being ten times as stupid as the characters in most movies today. It's about a girl at risk of losing her home searching for her father. What feels like an hour of the film is devoted to silent footage of the protagonist walking through the woods. If you cut half of the \\"walking through the woods\\" out, the movie would be an hour long. And again, there was a lot of buildup but NO ENDING... it just ends.<br /><br />The actors do a pretty good job given the script, but this film is a massive bore. I don't even think hobos with shotguns could save this film. I honestly don't get all the praise this gets.
0670022411|1.0|The way this book was setup was much like The Empire Strikes Back: much preparation for what is to come in the next book with no big payoffs in this one. Perhaps it would have worked better as the second book in a series of three, but as the first, it fails. Hopefully the following books will redeem this one, but even books that are set as parts of trilogies should stand on their own.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|The STORY is not something to read about in a DVD review on Amazon =) Do not spoil the story by reading about it beforehand...    The DVD is simple - 4 discs included with a special features portion on the 4th. The packaging is basic but nice - it is NOT like BBC's EMMA DVD Case where it is gorgeous and finished all around. The price here is fine with free shipping. This is a case of getting what you pay for and being rewarded for it.    The CONTENT is amazing - yes... the story's conclusion at the very end will require a few 'rewinds' to understand it all but that does not detract from this stunningly acted, emotional tv series... Do yourself a favor and stay in for a Friday, Saturday & Sunday evening and enjoy one of the most moving mini-series available of a truly uplifting nature.    Again - for content regarding the movie - do not spoil it ahead of time. And for whatever is missed/overlooked in this tv adaption... that is what the book is for... happy watching and reading!
B001AJ09JW|4.0|I loved Ghost Ship.<br /><br />It's probably a good thing that I actually didn't see it for quite a long time: I kept walking by it on video store shelves and seeing it pop up on my amazon list several times, but then dismissed it as one of those B movie knockoff of greater sea-horror movies such as Virus. Well, one day, I turned on the TV, nothing else was on, and so I ended up watching Ghost Ship.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a scathing critic of the horror genre, mostly because I was watching the classics from the time I was like, five. Not much shocks or surprises me any more.<br /><br />However, firstly, the opening was enough to make even me cringe. It caught my attention with that. Then, as the move progressed, it had several clever twists and turns and totally wasn't what I expected at all. The end I WAY didn't see coming, and so that was awesome.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne was brilliant in this-I was spoiled on him from End of Days but bitterly disappointed at how hollow his acting seemed in Stigmata. He made up for it here. Urban (of now Star Trek fame) also had a part in this movie, and he's a fantastic actor, too-all in all, if you like being sucked in by a -looks-cheap-but-isn't- kind of horror movie, this is the one to see.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I just picked up this dandy little device this past winter so I could watch my training HR more closely without always having to stop and check it, or grip the sensors on the treadmill.  It works great and is easy to set up (once you get the hang of the bezel feature).  I like it even more now that I can get outside and make use of the GPS features to monitor distance and speed as well.  The wireless transfer of data to the computer is awesome too.  Very easy to log training and compare similar workouts for progress.
B004LFO0FG|2.0|This album personally isn't for me, but maybe to others. I've been a fan of Britney's music since I was 8, when Baby One More Time came out, and now I'm 20, and Britney just released  her seventh album Femme Fatale. I wish I could like this album, more than I do, but I just can't. I personally think Britney came back with Circus, now I'm in fear her music is slowly going downhill again. I personally didn't like Blackout much either. My favorite albums by her are most of her earlier albums. I will say Britney is a strong person, I think she can get through anything life throws at her. I personally think in ways Lady Gaga has taken over, which isn't a bad thing, because we all need something new sometimes. I've wondered for a long time if Britney is auto tuned at all, because she lip syncs in live concerts. Some of the songs on this album aren't even worth listening to. I really don't know what happened, but this is an album I didn't expect from her, after Circus. Personally it's hard for me to listen to this album. I think this is Britney's worst album to date. I don't know if I'll be following her much anymore. I'm really disappointed with this album. I know Britney can do way better than this. I don't see how Entertainment Weekly gave this album a B+. I don't recommend this album.
B004SBULWE|1.0|Do not use this program if you have an EVO and perhaps similar phones.  I was lucky in that this program only crashed my phone.  After the crash, when I finally got my phone running again it said the last program running was ATK!  Also if you read reviews in the Android market, as I did trying to figure out what happened, you will see this is a common occurrence and many people had their EVO destroyed by using it.  BEWARE!
0385341679|5.0|The final installment of the Fever series does not disappoint.  Many questions are answered (but not EVERYTHING).  I love the chemistry between the main characters and there are several twists and turns that were unexpected.  I am happy with the ending which dangles the carrot of more to come in the form of a spin-off from the Fever series.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I heard a lot of good things about this show so I decided to check it out for myself.  I am so glad I did as I am now a HUGE fan of the show and never get tired of watching it.  I like this show even more than the Twilight Saga movies!  I plan on purchasing Season 2 as soon as it is out.  Season 2 is even better than Season 1...the show just keeps getting better and better!

B004SUWR2C|1.0|Awful! Doesn't run fullscreen on my device, and the game won't even start after you enter your name. Might be fine on some cell phones, but on a tablet, it's just junk, and a complete waste of time and money. Hopefully they'll provide a refund, or I'll have to contest the charge on my credit card. I know the real Android Market will give you a refund for apps that don't work.    To Amazon's credit, they swiftly gave me a refund. I was a little worried, because their stated policies on digital products is no refunds, but their customer service is excellent.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Ah, the \\"Dreamworks face\\"... that half-smirking look that title characters on dreamworks-made features are (in)famous for having, whether they could physically do such a face in reality or not. It's reached an almost anti-meme status, and Megamind's promo material seems particularly guilty of flashing this particularly odd remark. Looking past that though, would be to your credit. Megamind may literally be one of their best pieces of work I'd seen.    Starting with a particularly amusing narrative, Megamind finds himself starting on the wrong side of fate and destiny, while his rival would start with the silver spoon of sorts. And even with being regularly defeated, Megamind shows the standard comic-book variety drive of a villain who never stops, always wanting to plot another plan for his singular and strongest rival. But it is when one of his plans does appear to work, that he realizes how different it is without a challenge. In trying to create a new nemesis, the plan to once again have balance backfires, and it becomes time for Megamind to put his brilliance to a new purpose. At least, that's about as much as I could say without completely spoiling it for anyone that didn't see it or at least didn't already read the synopsis available on IMDB.    The first thing that took me by surprise with the movie, is Will Ferrel's performance for the lead role. Primarily, because it actually felt... natural, and suited to the character, at last. In his previous works, I would always find him either just being forceful about his role to the point of irritating, or completely out of place in a scene because he seems to try to 'force' things or take them too far. This is probably the first time in a long time, where he didn't do any of these things... and where everything about it just felt right. The awkwardness of his brand of humor fit snugly with that of megamind's existence... even to the purposely mispronounced words and character acting. When seeing it, I initially hadno idea it was will Ferrel, simply because it didn't feel like another Will Ferrel(tm) schlock job. Even now, I don't feel like I'm listening to Will Ferrel... and that's impressive.    Megamind (the movie) also does some pretty good nods to comic and superhero cliche's... just enough to give a nod or satire, while being brief enough to keep the focus on the main part of the plot... the interactions that go on with the character and the ranges of emotion that happen in such a case. The big blue baddie was simply content in having a challenge. The goal might have been to \\"take over\\" Metro City, but he realizes how empty that was. And when he realizes certain things about his typical \\"bait\\" for the hero, finds that maybe there was more reason than simply to have a 'prize' for the hero to rescue. And when his plan to have a new challenger backfires, it then becomes time to find a new purpose... and it is this story that is told very well in this movie.    Though I only have the BluRay copy, I find it odd that Dreamworks didn't (to my knowledge) publish it as a BD3D feature, given that this movie is constantly referenced as one of the better \\"users\\" of 3D as a film-making form of progress. Honestly, I find it rather embarrassing on my part that I had so little knowledge of what this movie was about while it was in theaters. If I had known I would like it this much, I would have actually gone to see it in 3D to see how good it would look. But I'm afraid that doing so would then make me want to spend the mega-bucks it would take to have a 3D-capable TV and player setup.    Even the extra feature short on the BluRay (which takes place the next day after the events of the movie) was very well done, and fits into things nicely. No doubt a sequel will be planned, if it's not in the works. Here's hoping that Dreamworks is able to give us more of this kind of production quality... I'll even put up with a poster full of \\"Dreamworks face\\" if it means the next movie is as good asthis one.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|Great, lightweight case from Lowepro.  Can fit almost any camera that fits the case dimenstions(officially at: 3.7 x 3.9 x 7.1 inches;6.4 ounces.) It also has a nifty compartment to store your memory cards.  It provides minimal protection if your camera ever to drop, but it does have a loop so that you can secure it in a variety of ways.
0345529057|5.0|these books are really great!!      I am reading an ebook version (KOBO from canada)  but I am buying this paperback set for my daughter so she can read them too. The series is very good. One of the best fantasy series I have ever read.    I am looking forward to the HBO series which starts April 2011...can't wait!  Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings fame) plays Eddard Stark, the main character.    excellent!!!    (please dont mix the bad reviews, they seem to be for a badly done ebook version)    thank you
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|Seriously, nobody would of thought that AIC would ever make a come back, at any point, especially after icon Layne Staley, the voice of the band, passed on. First off i have been a fan of the band since the early 90's, secondly i never thought \\"AIC resurrected\\" would be as good as this turned out to be. When i first heard that the band was getting back together , touring etc it seemed to be like a tribute to express the real loss of Layne and what they had together, and to share that with the fans. I heard of many singers taking the stage with the band, and it felt like a big remembrance celebration of what once was and which almost everyone thought would never ever be again. THEN the guy that stuck \\"William Duvall. We all know that Layne was irreplaceable but this guy just fit, sound wise and personality wise, chemistry wise, everything wise lol. Then when i heard that they were going to record a album of NEW AIC tunes, it still came as a surprise. Yeah sure, i get it, tour the old songs everybody loves and the crowd can sing every word to but, add to that, expectations of the quality of new material kind of shell shocked myself and a lot of others.Fast forward to the Completion of \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" and you couldn't of asked for or expected a better comeback from said band and album. Everything about the album screams classic AIC and then adds a hint of a future. From jerry's guitar leading the first track \\"All Secrets Known\\" with Jerry's fist to face honest lyrics setting the scene for Duvall's introductory \\"all secrets known\\" later in the song, sucking me in totally to what the new AIC monster has become. \\"Check My Brain\\" was a great single choice with jerry singing lead and kind of makes you laugh (yes AIC has a sence of humor!) but it is classic AIC, california baby, lol. \\"Last Of My Kind\\" intro sounds like it could of been a track on \\"Dirt\\" then, AIC introduce us to Duvall's debut lead vocal in a song of it's own,which is its own monster, the chorus performance by W Duvall is damn hot and sure to win over some people, it did me. \\"Your Decision\\" well, \\"Jar Of Flies\\" anyone, this is the sort of mellow track with a HUGE feeling that AIC have made their own, as good as \\"Nutshell\\", No Excuses\\", Down In A Hole\\" etc.\\"A Looking In View\\" Damn!, what a freakin' heavy track, down tune heaven!!, this song shows that they can write some killer tracks with the \\"Duvall/Cantrell\\" crossing vocal style, A CLASSIC!!!! \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\", mellow, beautiful, i swear i can hear Layne in this song, no joke!.\\"Acid Bubble\\" sounds like it could of been off the \\"Three Legged Dog\\" album, except Duvall's sings where Layne would off....:P.The Track \\"Lesson Learned\\" sounds like a Jerry Cantrell \\"Degradation Trip\\" song, still, Jerry's AIC's main songwriter so thats ok:). Same with \\"Take Her Out\\" though i find the lyrics funny, especially the \\"are you getting sick of me whinging\\" line, love it!, \\"Private Hell\\" again this is a track i swear has Layne written all over it, sad, but it's just a beautiful song, real emotion twisting stuff, brilliant. Then the last track \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" as good as any song they have ever done, just different, as you realize by this point that Laynes not going to come in with some awesome harmony vocal, sadly, you know it's AIC saying goodbye, goodbye to their ex band mate, friend, and musical soulmate. All i can say after listening to what i've just heard is, AIC, you have done your buddy Layne proud!!!............JUST LISTEN EVERYONE.<br /><br />5/5rformance by W Duvall is damn hot and sure to win over some people, it did me. \\"Your Decision\\" well, \\"Jar Of Flies\\" anyone, this is the sort of mellow track with a HUGE feeling that AIC have made their own, as good as \\"Nutshell\\", No Excuses\\", Down In A Hole\\" etc.\\"A Looking In View\\" Damn!, what a freakin' heavy track, down tune heaven!!, this song shows that they can write some killer tracks with the \\"Duvall/Cantrell\\" crossing vocal style, A CLASSIC!!!! \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\", mellow, beautiful, i swear i can hear Layne in this song, no joke!.\\"Acid Bubble\\" sounds like it could of been off the \\"Three Legged Dog\\" album, except Duvall's sings where Layne would off....:P.The Track \\"Lesson Learned\\" sounds like a Jerry Cantrell \\"Degradation Trip\\" song, still, Jerry's AIC's main songwriter so thats ok:).

B0013H9DPM|5.0|This album is one of the best Styx albums ever. Suite Madame Blue is one of the greatest songs ever, I can't believe it's been almost forty years since this album came out.
B00005JPSM|5.0|I love this movie.  The cast is excellent from top to bottom, with Aaron Eckhart being at the top of the list for me.  He and Zeta-Jones have a wonderful chemistry.  It's a sweet romance with moments of humor.  In addition there is the bonus of some wonderful operatic music, of which I would have liked more.  This is a movie I will watch over and over again.  Try it  --  you'll like it.
B004TP6O8O|5.0|I just finished my third listen through of \\"Rolling Papers\\" and all I can say is wow. The production on this album is crazy. The instrumentals alone would be worthy of a purchase. Wiz's delivery on every track is magic and the hooks mesh perfectly with the melodies. There are no \\"filler\\" tracks. Just press play, relax and enjoy your flight. Stamp this album as a classic.
B004SBX112|4.0|A nice new set of season-themed angry birds levels. Yes, there's a free app for this out there, but think of that more as a trial version - the ads sap performance if you're not on a top of the shelf phone or tablet, and they really get annoying after a while. Get the paid version - it's worth it.    There's also been a string of low-cost apps being cheap due to their staggering extent of permission grabbing (access to contacts, phone state, all that fun stuff). I'm not a fan of having my personal data stripped from my phone shipped to some random data center to be sold off for a few pennies. This app doesn't fall into that category, which is appreciated.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I've read all of the Camel Club books series and Stone Cold is by far my favorite.  With the addition of the character of Annabelle from the last book the Camel Club gains purpose and balance.      I seldom read all the books in a series, and I'm not a huge thriller fan, but I found myself attached to these characters and honored the decency of the main character, Oliver Stone.  I may not like everything he does but I do understand the human reasons for him doing it.      I'm watching and hoping that Baldacci gets back to these basics because Stone Cold is the shining example of his writing.  Character loyalty sells books.

0756404738|4.0|I was torn between 3 and 4 star for this review.  I settled at 3.5 and had to round up.<br /><br />This book just didn't live up to what it could have been. We waited a long time for this book to come out due to revisions by the author, which are totally understandable.  Why would he publish something he wasn't happy with?  I have no problem waiting until he's satisfied with what he's created.  But after years of revisions, is he really happy with Wise Man's Fear?  I was so excited when I heard it was going to be longer than The Name of the Wind.  But after trudging along on some pieces in the book, I think it should have been about 100 - 250 pages shorter.<br /><br />I don't want to drop any spoilers, but I really thought the story would've advanced further than it did.  Or that we would've learned something about the Chandrian.<br /><br />I also don't want to sound like I didn't like the book, because I did.  I read the Name of the Wind in 1 week, which is pretty fast for how I read.  I thought I would read this one in 2 tops since it was longer.  It took me almost a month to read it.  I couldn't put Wind down.  With this one, I didn't feel the same pull to go back and pick it up.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.  It is very well written, as we can expect from Rothfuss.  But the parts that drag on and seem to repeat themselves definitely detract.  Don't go in expecting The Name of the Wind.
0345505387|3.0|It was fun to get to see things from Jamie's point of view and to learn new details of the story I love.  I didn't care for all the illustrations though.  Some of the expressions on the characters were strange and distracting.  It was hard to keep track of which man was which in some of the scenes.  The worst was Claire's chest popping out all the time and it was insanely huge in some of the scenes.

B004G6009K|5.0|I had lost interest in Disney animated features somewhere between The Lion King and... can anyone really remember? As Disney moved towards 3D animation I must admit with exception of WALL-E there hasn't been a story that really defined what Disney is famous for: taking an already original (classic) story and adding the Disney twist. Tangled is the rebirth of this definition and more. I am looking forward to watching this again once the DVD is out. It's great for family and surprising enough I have found that even guys found it entertaining despite not being into fairy tales.

B004LWZW0Q|5.0|Two of us went to see this movie, both 33 years old. The lady at the ticket counter even laughed at us because we were seeing it.  But the movie was GREAT.  It was really really funny.  I'm sure this movie is better than most other movies out at the same time.  Check it out!
1450400957|2.0|Received the book today. Starts out by telling me \\"why\\" I should workout at home.Thanks for letting me know before hand that the book was for home workouts. Weights, elastic bands and bodyweight exercises? Sorry, only saw a guy and girl lifting on cover. Should have waited for more reviews. And on a side note, if anyone went to a gym wearing the shorts the guys wear in the book, I see why they workout at home. I loved the anatomy book, and I really wanted to love this one. Sorry.

B004LFO0FG|2.0|\\"Femme Fatale\\" is Britney Spears' first absolutely disappointing album.<br /><br />There are \\"hits\\" here - the quick-jerk stop-and-start \\"Hold It Against Me\\" and the chilly, swirling \\"Till the World Ends,\\" neither of which sounds all too different from the other - but at this point in her career Spears has hit singles pierce the upper reaches of the pop charts not because of talent or the strength of the songs themselves, but because of the devotion of fans who buy her songs without question immediately upon their release.<br /><br />In other words, the album can be considered a hit, but in name only, and only for the time being. These songs are not particularly impressive no matter how high they go on the charts, and they are destined to be forgotten within a few months' time.<br /><br />Spears has always been along for the ride on her albums - a figurehead of sorts for producers and song writers to use to sell their product. Interest in her music arises because of the personality and flair she and her persona bring to the table. That matters little so long as the results are positive, and they very much were on \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Circus\\" because each album had a tidy selection of strong, rhythmic, extremely catchy songs. \\"Femme Fatale\\" does not.<br /><br />Because Spears' presence and personality are the driving force of her music the imperfections of \\"Femme Fatale\\" hang naked in the mix. Whether it's the limp, unengaging \\"Trouble for Me\\" or \\"Inside Out,\\" the latter of which has production effects that sound like a computer crashing, the textures and beats are, with rare exception, too loud and too prominent. The producers are trying to cover up how listless and unimpressive the songs are by bathing them in loud, thrashing sounds that only serve to push Spears further into the background.<br /><br />There are no strong pop melodies such as with \\"Sometimes\\" or energetic, catchy hooks such as with \\"Womanizer.\\" Even the precious few strong moments - \\"Trip to Your Heart\\" with its ideal combination of spaced-out vocals, bouncy melody and trippy beats is one of them - do not quite have the power to carve out a permanent place in the memory of the listener, although they might sound great on dance floors in club-mixed form.<br /><br />In a way, \\"Femme Fatale\\" is particularly interesting because it may just be the consummate example of a singular problem that is happening to pop music - a shift away from melody and hooks to sounds created almost exclusively from rhythmic repetition. \\"Big Fat Bass\\" featuring will.i.am is the easiest example: \\"You can be my bass, you can be my bass, you can be my bass, you can be my bass, you can be my bass...\\" Repetition of a word sequence is simply lazy music-making.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Overall, let me start out by saying this was a phenomenal movie. Hands down one of my most favorite releases of 2009. James Cameron is the director of many acclaimed movies and his other most notable movie was Titanic - another masterpiece.     Avatar tells the story of a human occupation on an alien and distant planet. The plot and story for the most part revolve solely around the story of Pandora (the planet) and its history/future. When the main character (played by Sam Worthington) whom is disabled from the waist down is given the ability to utilize creatures called Avatars to perform activities he hasn't been able to do in a long time things get interesting. Avatar is a movie that takes the viewer on an amazing and colorful journey and can be enjoyed by just about anyone.    Pros:  Beautiful scenes and color  Character Development  Plot Development    Cons:  Movie left me only wanting to spend more time on the planet of Pandora    Endstate:  Definitely a movie for any member of the family
B004NSULHM|3.0|Radiohead fans of unquestioned devotion will find a sizeable amount to savor on \\"The King of Limbs.\\" Lyrical content from the likes of the quivering \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" and the Middle Eastern-influenced \\"Little By Little\\" does hark back to the salad days of Thom Yorke and company.<br /><br />The presentation and overall punch of the album as a whole, however, fails to particularly engage or resonate - and that means in general, not only in (unfair) comparison to \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer.\\" Dubbing the album uninspired or lackluster is perhaps unduly harsh, but then those adjectives are dangerously in range when juxtaposing \\"The King of Limbs\\" with new releases from Duran Duran and The Strokes, bands that have not reached the artistic zenith that Radiohead once did.<br /><br />The sounds are uniformly safe, drowsy and dour. \\"The King of Limbs\\" is the final product not of a band afraid to take chances but of one making \\"the next Radiohead album.\\" The results are not phoned in and non-committal - it is hard to imagine anything filtered through Thom Yorke's voice warranting those adjectives - but then they do not radiate great vision, either. The songs sound as though they were created so that a new album could be born, not because the band had inspiration and a desperate need to artfully channel it.<br /><br />Radiohead remain unmatched in their ability to permeate a particular mood. No song demands particular attention, so the album can be played all the way through in meditative fashion. Whether it is \\"Lotus Flower,\\" bathed in beats, drums and Yorke's elastic, sexy voice, or the spare, calming \\"Seperator,\\" the songs retain a transportive, majestic edge in their overall cohesive function. Their sound is not particularly fun or thrilling, so the album is not worth deliberately seeking out to put on the stereo, but should it happen to be playing it is not worth turning off, either.<br /><br />\\"The King of Limbs\\" might be the best album of 2011 for office workers to soothe their jangled nerves with/give their senses over to on the commute home. Given the age of the average Radiohead fan, perhaps that is precisely what the band was going for. It is only subdued, however, not sublime - and from a band that has, at its best, offered up a substantial allotment of the latter adjective, it is difficult to ignore that./give their senses over to on the commute home.

1580176941|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book.  I stumbled on it sort of by accident while looking for cookie cutters online one day.  I  wanted to get into baking more and have always wondered how I could get a more professional look to my cookies.  I read this book cover to cover when it arrived (I recommend doing that before you try doing any baking, sort of like reading a whole recipe before you start cooking).  It is so interesting to read and the authors are witty and have a neat writing style.  If you want to make beautiful cookies this book will teach you how.  Practice makes better as they say, so give it some time too.  I wonder if the very few negative reviews were from people that thought they should magically be able to bake award winning cookies just by holding the book :)  My mom and I have really enjoyed learning this \\"craft\\" and everyone we have shared our creations with loves them!

B001IF252C|4.0|Contrary to most of the reviews posted here, I have had very little trouble getting this display converter to work properly. I have had this adapter for almost a year, use it daily and have had very few complaints.    Currently it is hooked up to my 17\\" MacBook Pro (2010) and drives an HP LP3065 30\\" monitor. It is completely plug and play. Hook it up and it works just as it should... provided you use a Dual-Link DVI cable between the converter and the monitor. This is very important. How can you tell what type of cable you have? Simply look at the cable connector. If the connector looks full of pins, it should likely be dual-link. If it appears to be missing a block of pins in the middle of the connector, it is single-link and will not work at resolutions above 1920x1200. Also, make sure your computer/graphics card can output a screen display at greater than 1920x1200 resolution.    I have also tested this converter on a PC with DisplayPort Out using a DP to miniDP converter cable and it worked fine as well, so this adapter doesn't only just work on Macs.    The only negative I can really say about this adapter (except I wish it were a little less expensive) is that I have encountered the \\"static\\" display bug other people have complained about, as my converter only has the 1.02 firmware.    Basically, I use both a PC and my MacBook Pro with my HP monitor. If I wake up my Mac's screen display as I am switching inputs on the monitor over to the Mac, I can get a brief flicker of static that will repeat about every 3 seconds or so. Simply unplugging the USB cable (that powers the converter), waiting a couple of seconds for the Mac's display to reset to the single on-board display and then plugging it back in solves the problem. When it happens it is annoying, but not a big deal. I have considered taking it in to an Apple store to be replaced with an adapter running 1.03 firmware before the warranty expires, but since it happens so infrequently, I have never gotten around to it.    If you need a miniDisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI converter, don't fret about getting this adapter. It does the job provided you have a DL-DVI cable, and a computer with a graphics card capable of outputting a screen display over 1920x1200.

0061726826|5.0|From beginning to end, this book captivated me, didn't let me out of its clutches, and I enjoyed the entire ride, even when the ending left me with a numb hollow feeling of seeing something more bitter than sweet but still very powerful.<br /><br />Stories about love being identifies as a disease are not new, but this one was done so wonderfully that I barely paid attention to the fact that this idea has been done a dozen times before. The story had a surprising twist to the old idea, though; where most stories that take that idea only focus on the elimination of romantic or sexual love, Delirium went whole hog and even had familial love be outlawed and viewed as an expression of disease. From marital partners being assigned by government agencies to parents not conforting a crying child, all expressions of affection are viewed as shameful and wrong, sick and twisted and detrimental to humanity as a whole.<br /><br />It was chilling to see, especially when done so subtly and deeply as to pervade every piece of the book's society -- one which, I might add, is very close to our own, evidently set in the not-too-distant future. This book makes it clear that this is the sort of thing that could very well happen if anyone ever discovered a surefire way to eliminate love. That society is just as obsessed with love as our own, only from the opposite end of the spectrum.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver style is smooth, evenly-paced, and she has a real knack for capturing some of the less-easily-defined aspects of emotion and thought, some of the more obstract expressions of things that we think and feel in life but can't always put words to in the moment. She can pull off being shocking, sweet, heart-poundingly scary, heartbreak... I fell into the main character and her way of thinking and speaking with great ease, something which isn't always easy to accomplish when I'm reading a book intended for an audience a decade younger than me.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book, to fans of YA novels, speculative fiction, and those who enjoy a good heartbreaking love story.

0439023521|5.0|As a fan of dystopias, I was sure I'd like this book, especially after hearing nonstop good reviews for it. I'm very happy to say that I wasn't disappointed once while reading this one.<br /><br />Well, that's a lie. I was. Once. When I had to stop reading it because I had work to do. But that's not the book's fault, and I won't hold that against it.<br /><br />This is definitely a book you feel uncomfortale going into, because you know that if you root for anyone other than Katniss, you're entirely likely to be disappointed. Bitterly. In a Battle Royale situation, where only one can win, pinning your hopes on anyone who isn't the main character is just foolish.<br /><br />Which is the book's main flaw, really. The actions scenes were wonderfully tense, and Katniss didn't escape without injury, but when you're reading about a kill-or-be-killed situation from the first-person point of view, you know in advance how it's going to end. You know that Katniss will live. It can take away from the tension at moments, because even though you can recognize the danger she's in, you also know, in the back of your mind, that she'll find a way to survive. It's less about faith in a character and more about predestination.<br /><br />That being said, I think this story would have suffered had it not been from Katniss's point of view, so this is definitely a moment of \\"your mileage may vary.\\"<br /><br />There were, happily, some twists and turns thrown in to keep the reader interested. The development of alliances, the rule changes, and the omnipresent disgust you have to feel at the people who are watching teenagers beat each others' brains out on live TV. I felt a definitely sense of satisfaction at Katniss and Peeta's final \\"screw you\\" to the Capitol, which wasn't at all overshadowed by the fact that I knew they'd make it out alive.<br /><br />I closed this book wanting to open the next one immediately. Sadly, I don't have a copy yet, so I'm going to have to wait to continue these adventures. I've got to say though, that they're definitely adventures well worth continuing.

B004E2XAFW|4.0|Well after two live releases called [[ASIN:B001DPC52C Black Symphony (CD/DVD)]] and [[ASIN:B002OHB3CG An Acoustic Night at the Theatre]], Within Temptation has returned with their fifth studio album (and first studio album since 2007's [[ASIN:B000ROALIU The Heart of Everything]]) with their very first concept album, based off of a comic book being released under the same name, available from Within Temptation's website. Fans who were initially worried about the band changing their style too much to fit within the storyline of a comic book (myself included) needed not worry. This new album does indeed contain some new, dare I say \\"improvements\\" over their former material, particularly in the realm of the guitar leads, in which almost every song has some kind of guitar solo. But the classic bombastic sound with the choirs and orchestras are all still there as well, only being built upon more as a foundation instead of being a focal point. Sadly, their clueless record label, Roadrunner Records (who has done an abysmal job promoting this band in America thus far) has chosen one of the album's weakest tracks, \\"Faster\\" (which has a similar structure to \\"Wicked Game\\" by Chris Isaac in the verses) to be the debut single, while there are several other songs which would have made far better choices to represent the whole sound of the album.<br /><br />Perhaps the standout track for me is \\"Shot In The Dark\\". This album begins with the spoken lines of \\"Mother Maiden\\" (a character from the comic) before \\"Shot In The Dark\\" begins. It starts off with a solemn choir while a more trip-hop beat begins as Sharon's voice comes in, sounding somewhat more angry than we are used to hearing from her. Definitely different from the explosive intro songs from [[ASIN:B000ROALIU The Heart of Everything]] or even [[ASIN:B000AJIAOO The Silent Force]], however once the chorus kicks in, the Within Temptation I first fell in love with (around the time of [[ASIN:B000TZ8Q9I Mother Earth]]) returns in full glory with the soaring epic symphonic soundscape powering you through the chorus with the crunching guitars coming in. It seems like on every album there is one song that is so infectious and just makes me fall in love with it because of the fantastic chorus, and \\"Shot In The Dark\\" is this album's \\"Frozen\\" or \\"Angels\\". From this track onwards, the album continues with a more uptempo song \\"In The Middle Of The Night\\" (which seems to be a fan-favorite) before becoming a bit more mediocre with \\"Faster\\". However after \\"Faster\\", the album is pure enjoyment containing all the classic WT sounds with choirs, driving guitars, powerful orchestras all fronted by Sharon's incredibly commanding, yet beautiful vocals. A couple of the songs touch upon a more \\"power metal\\" influence, while even a few electronic influences (especially \\"Sin&eacute;ad\\") can be heard. Unfortunately, there are no full out, purely beautiful soft ballads along the lines of \\"Pale\\", \\"Memories\\" or \\"Forgiven\\". The closest the album comes to these songs is \\"Fire And Ice\\" and \\"Lost\\", although both of these songs pick up as they progress, more in the vein of \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Frozen\\". But overall, this album should not disappoint any longtime fans, and will (hopefully) gain them many new ones. Within Temptation has once again proven why they are my top favorite female fronted band (beating out other beloved bands like Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, Lunatica, Delain, Era For A Moment, La-Ventura, We Are The Fallen, Delight, Autumn, The Birthday Massacre, Octavia Sperati, Noctura, Angtoria, Neranature, Brave, Lullacry, Nightwish, Echoes Of Eternity, Nemesea, The Gathering, Fountain Of Tears, Unsun, Leaves' Eyes, etc., etc.) and are in no danger of falling to any others.<br /><br />I must also mention that it's nice to get a dvd with this set containing the three music videos from this album on it (\\"Faster\\", \\"Sin&eacute;ad\\" and \\"Shot In The Dark\\" along with \\"Utopia\\", a \\"Making Of\\" featurette for the three includedshort films and a promo video for \\"Where Is The Edge\\"). As a whole, the entire album does not disappoint (for what is given at least). So then why did I give this superb album only four stars? Well, the reason is simple. If you look at the Itunes/Amazon MP3 version of this release, you will notice that they get three exclusive songs called \\"I Don't Wanna\\", \\"The Last Dance\\" (which is much closer to the soft type songs like \\"Pale\\" and \\"Towards The End\\" I was hoping for) and \\"Empty Eyes\\". Many hardcore Within Temptation fans believe I am just a complainer, but I simply don't appreciate being sold something that I know could have been so much better with such a simple adjustment. This album is the \\"deluxe\\" physical version, which to me, means it should be the most complete, ultimate version of the album available for purchase with NOTHING missing. By Roadrunner not including these songs on the album, I feel like I am buying an incomplete product. I want the ENTIRE collection of songs in a \\"deluxe\\" physical package that I can hold in my hands and have to show for my spent money. When record labels pull this despicable stunt, they are fully encouraging piracy because no true music fan wants to be screwed out of songs. All fans should be treated equally and therefore I believe that it is extremely wrong to offer mp3 customers extra songs as a reward for them embracing the digital monster, while punishing the true collectors/fans who are willing to pay more for the physical release (and who made their record label business possible in the first place), by giving us less music for our money. I do not enjoy having to buy an album that is not complete and that will now force me to have to make my own, superior/complete version of the album, with the three bonus tracks included, since this retail version will soon make me feel more and more cheated. Had these three songs been included on the physical release of the album and the record label not continued to cater to the same crowd of people who seemingly can't pay attention to any album that is over 12 tracks long, then this album would have been an easy five star product, and possibly Within Temptation's best album to date. The absence of just one great song, however, can make the difference between an album being good or else an album being fantastic. Honestly, I am just so tired of being shafted by record labels, for not being willing to accept digital albums as the way of the future, and thus being sold an incomplete product as a penalty, with songs being cut off of the album (not unlike chapters in a book being ripped out).

B004DCAOG6|5.0|Alas the impact of having to take out a second mortgage every time you go into a garage at the moment precludes the purchase of the super deluxe tin box set of this classic album by Bobby Gillespie's funsters Primal Scream. Should however the lottery ever yield more than a tenner then it will be first into the basket. Until then this remastered version of the 20 year old Screamadelica will do fine (where has the time gone?). \\"Screamadelica\\" is one of the great music fusion albums. Just about every music genre is to be found in its grooves from jazz to dub from rock to rave, but more than this is segues together as a unified whole with a underpinning vibe which makes it one of the best British albums of the past two decades.<br /><br />It is of course a album for ever associated with \\"the summer of love\\" in the early 1990s and there is no denying that the band partook of a vast array and range of substances in its making. Gillespie for example has recently confessed that he was so out of it during the recording of the second track \\"Slip inside this house\\" that he didn't provide the vocal, instead it was completed by Robert Young on warbling duties. Similarly there is some lovely irony in the fact that the year it won the Mercury Prize in 1992, one bookie had Simply Red's \\"Stars\\" as the favourite. Primal Scream of course were more concerned to get higher than the sun and this album today sounds a fresh as ever with the new remastering giving it a pristine clarity and focus, although to be fair the first mix particularly by the combined talent of Andy Weatherall, Jimmy Miller and the Orb was a miracle of its age. The album starts with the best Rolling Stones song which Jagger and Richards never wrote \\"Moving on up\\" which is a bravado opener, but it is when the psychedelic house grooves of \\"Slip inside\\" kicks in that the album really goes into overdrive. Strangely the brilliant \\"Don't fight it feel it\\" now sounds so familiar its almost nostalgic. The remastered version here rumbles even better than before and could teach todays dance music creators a thing or two. Its also hard to recall at the time the sheer horror, bemusement and confusion that \\"The Orb\\" produced \\"Higher than the sun \\" and the later Dub Symphony had on the more conventional rock fans, but today it makes total and exhilarating sense. As for the rest there is \\"Come together\\" a glorious ten minute behemoth of gospel, house and dub beats and the signature Primal Scream song \\"Loaded\\" which saw Andy Weatherall's producing genius at the fore and the emergence of \\"baggy\\" as a youth culture. Perhaps as a consequence of the passing of age it is now the great mellow comedown anthem \\"Damaged\\" which is my favourite song on the album which some aspiring Alt Country singer should revive as a matter of the upmost urgency. Finally it all wrapped up with the accordion sounding space-jazz of the lovely \\"Shine like the stars\\" and I haven't even managed to mention the glories of \\"Inner flight\\" or \\"I'm comin down\\". To add the proverbial icing to the cake you also have included here the Dixie Narco EP and its standout track \\"Carry me home\\" which shows that when Gillespie did fully apply himself he is one of the great rock vocalists.<br /><br />The same year Screamadelica was realised it also coincided with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\", Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines\\", Slint's \\"Spiderland\\" and U2s one and only truly great album \\"Achtung Baby\\"; what a year that was? If push came to the shove I would have to flip a coin between Kevin Shields crazed guitar symphony and Gillespie's acid rock masterwork. But frankly there is no need to have to make such a heinous choice just ensure that you own both albums and start with this mind-blowing wonder.mbles even better than before and could teach todays dance music creators a thing or two.

B004KSQN7C|1.0|This cd makes you want to punch your fist thru a wall and break your knuckles.  There are only 3 standout tracks on Femme Fatale. \\"Hold It Against Me\\", \\"Drop Dead Beautiful\\" and \\"Criminal\\".  The rest of the songs are repetative and monochrome, and most of them sound identical to eachother.  There is a total lack of creativity on Femme Fatale.  They are really beating this dance music to death, and the vocoder thing is getting really old.  I think Britney should have did less dance stuff and include more mid tempo and maybe throw in a good ballad, like she did on Circus.  Lyrically this album sucks, most of the lyrics are about going to da club and dancing.  This has already been done before and Britney should have changed it up and evolved.  This is phony music for club lonely phony people who are alcoholics and drug addicts.  I was so disgusted with this cd and felt like bringing into the house and throwing it against my bedroom wall.  I spent all the money I had on it and I was so upset, I called my ex-husband and asked if he could reimburse me.  He threw 20 dollars at me later, so I guess something good came out of this fiasco.
B004NSULHM|4.0|On the first listen to \\"King of Limbs\\" over a month ago mixed feelings were the order of the day. Certainly Radiohead eighth album send yet another \\"interstellar burst\\" into the record industry and by doing so frustrated those who \\"leak\\" new albums onto the Internet. The panic and exasperation of music critics around the globe trying to pen words of profundity on an album that had appeared out of nowhere on the web was an equal joy. Indeed it probably garnered some bad reviews on the part of the bands failure to send out promotional copies.<br /><br />Alternatively there was also a sense in some reviews that the album was a bit of a let down with the band stuck in a post \\"In Rainbows\\" rut of drab, cynical self-importance driven more by computer programming than any real emotion. Not so much wilfully difficult as just rather cold and grey. This reviewer felt that on occasions it sounded more like a Thom Yorke solo album and appeared a mixed \\"game of two halves\\" with an anxious weak opening but building to a strong finish.<br /><br />Repeated listens have revealed alternatively a delicious album which while not quite on par with \\"In Rainbows\\" is a splendid addition to the Radiohead oeuvre. It is an album where you could happily locate all of the songs individually onto the previous seven Radiohead albums with the synth rhythms and percussive drum loops of the opener \\"Bloom\\" harking back to Rainbows while the brilliant \\"Little by Little\\" is a song of darker hue and could happily sit on \\"Amnesiac\\". \\"Feral\\" alternatively is one of the album highlights and could soundtrack the darkest of movies as an urban soundscape; a bubbling bass led sonic adventure in the tradition of \\"Kid A' . Throughout the \\"King of Limbs\\" there is a notable absence of Jonny Greenwood guitar wizardry other than in a rhythmic sense. It is noted that a couple of reviews on US Amazon site have already stated this is Radiohead's worse album since Pablo Honey. Frankly this is an absurd and premature comparison not least since all Radiohead albums are the aural equivalent of a new pair of shoes. You have to wear them for a while to get the proper fit and there shape forms around you. But more than that the \\"King of limbs\\" is a reflective and sometimes impressionistic album full of shifting micro beats, weird sound effects and on occasions almost dupstep style backdrops. It is as if Flying Lotus has just bumped onto DJ Shadow or UNKLE, had a word with Burial and Four Tet who then invited the German noise masters Tangerine Dream to the party<br /><br />The presence of the wonderful stellar ballad \\"Codex\\" alone justifies the price of entry, as a Radiohead classic \\"ballad\\" its up there with \\"Shoot the moon\\" and \\"The Tourist\\" and may well turn out to be one of their greatest songs. The single \\"Lotus flower\\" is a song that shape shifts into a haunting, eerie electronic lament underpinned by scattered beats and percussion. The gentle acoustic \\"Give up the ghost\\" proves yet again that on his day Yorke has no peers when it comes to articulating and combining alienation with sublime beauty with a songs that attaches itself throughout to a ghostly simple vocal loop (\\"don't hurt me, don't hurt me\\").When it comes the sole guitar driven song on KOL \\"Morning Mr Magpie\\" the ghosts of Can and Neu are resurrected while the album finishes in peerless style with \\"the Separator\\" which plays the role on this album which \\"Nude\\" performed on \\"In Rainbows\\".<br /><br />\\"King of Limbs\\" is probably not as startlingly original as some of their past records and feels like a consolidation rather than a boundary challenging new chapter in the bands career. While it is easily the shortest thing Radiohead has ever produced it equally is not an album to come to grips with overnight and some will bemoan its lack of hook-laden songs and predominance of skeletal electronica.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|I didn't even get to downloading the game because it keeps asking me to enter credit card information for a game that is free... duuuhh its for future purposes but I don't plan to make any future purposes, that's what the Market is for. If I'm not spending any money IN THE PRESENT then I shouldn't have to enter my financial information. You have to basically sell your soul just to download the game.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Have you wanted to see The Phantom of the Opera on stage, but can't afford a ticket to see it or don't live near New York City, London, or Las Vegas and can't afford a trip to any of them?  Well, let me say, as someone who was lucky enough to see it when it was still on tour, that this movie is a great substitute for you.  It is just as good as the show itself.  Now, I'll admit that there is nothing like seeing a musical on stage, but not everybody can afford to go see one.  So when I watched this movie for the first time recently, I was kind of skeptical about watching it.  However, when I watched it, I fell in love with it.  It was almost exactly like the stage production.  I think that it stayed so close to the musical because Andrew Lloyd Webber supervised the making of the movie.  You can always tell when a musical movie has been made without the original composer's supervision.  They are usually horrible.  Thankfully, ALW  was involved in the whole process.      Okay, on to my thoughts about the movie.  Well, let me say, the acting choices were superb!  Emmy Rossum really showed the innocence of Christine.  She is an excellent singer as well.  I was not surprised that she had sung in the Metropolitan Opera as a young child after hearing her sing. Gerard Butler did such a great job as the Phantom.  He gave the Phantom a kind of rock and roll feel.  I didn't know that he could sing.  Now, I'll admit, he was not as good a singer as some of the stage actors who have played him, but for someone who had only sung in a rock band, he did a really good job.  He really showed the dark quality that draws women to the Phantom.  Patrick Wilson did an excellent job as Raoul.  I could honestly see him playing Raoul on the stage.  I had never heard of him until watching this and so I wasn't surprised when I found out that he had been in musical theater before.  It seems like that would be such a natural thing for him to do.  Now, even though I gave this movie 5 stars, I really feel like it deserved 4 1/2 stars instead.  I think they could have gotten better actors to play Andre and Firmin.  Also, I didn't really like the lyric changes so much.  I guess I've heard the OLC recording so much that it sounds weird to hear different lyrics.  Other than those two things, I recommend that everyone buy this movie!  You will not be disappointed.
B000FBJG04|4.0|All in all, this was an amazing book, and was written very well. The HBO series is one of my favorite shows of all time, and reading this book just made it even better. The only bad thing is that whoever transcribed the book to the kindle, didn't proof read and there are alot of mistakes that I know the author would not make.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rio has retained everything we love about the classic Angry Birds, and improved the graphics immensely. There is a better use of colors and depth of field.   Also, there are more variety in targets such as cages and monkeys.  Highly recommended!   I'd like to add that it's unfair to bash the game (to 1 star) here just coz the Amazon App Store has its problems.
B0000X61VE|5.0|Shape your body of cindy crawford is one of the best workout ever, you don't need to spend money in stuff you just need a couple of weights, a chair and a mat (for some exercises you need a big square pillow).  I bought many workouts before and you cannot follow them, they are not explained and they definetely go too fast.  In this Dvd all the exercises are explained they tell you exactly what an exercise is for and how to do it properly...  At the begining the exercises are really hard so is better to take time and not rush in doing them all since the first time.  I did the first workout of the dvd since a couple of weeks now and this monday i started the second workout and is so hard but i know is worth it!  I did them previously and I am starting to do them again because I know they work and the results are amazing :)  Best purchase ever!

B001UV4XHY|2.0|I realize that some things must change when you adapt a book to the big screen, but what was done to this particular book is appalling. Over the years the book to movie transition has steadily declined with this series and here the story is almost unrecognizable. I believed, I hoped, that splitting this book into two parts the powers that be would use the time to set right what they had failed in the other movies. To go back and explain key elements of the story and characters that they had glossed over before. But no, what they did was give us two hours of post-apocalyptic feely-type imagery and 3 teenagers roaming witlessly around the english countryside apparently without a clue between them - and very little magic either. JK Rowling wrote pages of clever dialogue in which these characters wrestle with their deepest fears and struggle with the smallest of clues that Dumbledore left them to unravel in order to defeat Voldemort. They planned and discussed and sacrificed. Harry went head to head with the minister of magic on moral principal. It took Harry months to convince Hermione to go to Godric's Hollow. But in the movie they do everything on a whim. It's all based on luck. Yates makes them look like idiots. This is the thing I find most offensive. And for a movie based on a magical world it seemed oddly lacking in magic. The Sorcerer's Apprentice had more magic in the first 5 minutes than the entire HP film. I will see the final installment because I need to finish this, but I am sorely disappointed. It's like watching a Cliff's notes version of a book you love. The heart and soul of the story is missing. The characters have been reduced to their lowest common denominators. If you haven't read any of the books do yourself a favor and don't start now. You will only know what you are missing. Wait until you have seen all the movies. Then read the actual story.

B0032Y8XH8|3.0|I'm a little late getting to the review and now more and more folks have heard of the 'Sigh No More', the debut disk from Mumford & Sons, especially after their impressive performance on the Grammys last month.<br /><br />At least I thought they were impressive. No studio trickery or wizardry, just talent. And from four guys from London all under 25 years old.<br /><br />I like their harmonies and their playing. The songwriting is ok to be sure and maybe just not more than ok......but again, they are young.<br /><br />The problem for me is that for the most part, the disk is pretty one note.  Too many of the songs sound the same. It's hard for me to tell  some songs apart.<br /><br />At least with a group like Great Big Sea you get variety. I don't feel that way here.<br /><br />That all being said, I still don't mind the overplayed \\"Little Lion Man\\" and I still really really like \\"The Cave\\".<br /><br />Are they enough for the purchase of the entire disk?  Overall, I'd say \\"no\\". It's not bad, the bad just needs some growth.

B004SBS8LA|2.0|Overall, this is a fun and addicting game with better graphics than previous versions. The biggest drawbacks are the necessity of the Amazon Appstore in order to run this app, and that it stops working after awhile. I canNOT open this app anymore.

B004SS0884|5.0|This has to be the weirdest Britney album ever. The album starts with the Till the world ends which is a powerhouse song, and moves forward with hold it against me ,another hit. The rest of the album is a mix of hardcore dance, electro pop music. Yes Britney's voice is change several times in each song but that's the point she's trying to make you dance and not be bore out  your mind. Another reason to get this is the insane beats, no song is the same not the slightest it's all different and there's something for everyone. My faves are Till the world ends, hold it against me, I wanna go, Drop Dead beautiful, Seal it with a kiss,big fat bass. I need to listen to the rest. And for all the people that say that Britney's voice is bad your wrong that's why you should get the deluxe edition for the song He about to lose me, you hear Britney's real voice without so much stuff on it. If you want an album with nothing but vocals get Adele's album, if you want to drop your ass cheeks on the dance floor get Femme Fatale.Britney's back  B*tch.

Swoon and Another World are my favorites from this new set of electronic anthems but it's not short of hits with every track offering something new and surreal. An arresting blend of melodic hooks, etherial keyboards, industrial backgrounds, catchy mantras and evolving beats. The Brothers have come a long way since working it out the first time and they still have a few aces up their sleeves. Looking forwards to what comes next.
B004EC5IUW|3.0|I decided to write a review to describe how disappointed I was with the packaging of this Blue-ray. (-1 star) 1.11 came with a beautiful box, vs. this tacky orange slip cover. As a collector, the packaging really ruined this purchase for me. In a way it is a bit ironic, considering 1.11 was a disappointment for me, due to it's repetitiousness reanimation of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion series. Hidaeki Anno actually took a little directorial liberty and added to the plot in this 2.22 remake. The irony is in the cheap packaging of the better product. From a business stand point FUNimation made the call to cut some corners and save a little money on packaging, which probably helped lower the retail price, but from a collectors standpoint, putting these products side by side seems a little pointless. I'm sure years from now after the next movie is released, a collectors edition will be released and solve this gripe, but for now it makes me wonder why I needed to buy this product. How about buying this product to keep FUNimation in Business? Well it's argument enough for me to buy the next movie too, but still I can't help but laugh when I put the two products side by side.     I'll also comment on the English Voice acting in this series. (-1 star) I constantly had to keep switching back to the Japanese to see how much liberty they were taking and it was considerable. Plus, as usual the English voice acting was just bland and lacked the well executed mannerisms that the Japanese voice actors always seem to do so much better. Other than that the animation, music, new Angels, addition plot and characters all make this title worth purchasing. As for the die hard NGE fans, you will probably see this remake as being for simple minded Hollywood action oriented viewers. In it's defense the explosions are spectacular! LoL

B002436WFI|4.0|The engaging wit of Terry Pratchett is not strongly evident in the movie The Color of Magic.  The acting is excellent, the photography well balanced, the staging convincing.  The wit is there but does not come through as brilliantly as in the written works of the author.  The action moves a little on the slow side.  As an avid fan of Mr. Pratchett's work the movie is worth having.    Tim Curry has had a productive, brilliant career.  He no doubt is one of todays superior character actors.  His portral of the villian wizard Trymon is both synister and humorous.    Death is a delightful droll entity in both this movie and in Hogsfather.    David Jason (Rincewind) and Sean Astin (Twoflower) deliver capturing performances.
B000YI7MRM|4.0|I can understand why this movie hasn't been marketed in the United States.  One needs to understand a bit about European history (The Hapsburgs, the 80 years war, the 30 years war, and the decline of the Spanish Empire) to understand the greater story that is being told.  To tell this larger story, there are lots of characters with complex stories that each get much less screen time than would do their stories justice, and the entire arc covers at least 25 years.      Ultimately, this is the story of the decline of Spanish supremacy through the eyes of a roguish larger than life swordsman in the Spanish army.  It is beautiful and there are many things to love about the movie, as long as you aren't expecting a passive theatrical story-telling experience.

It is rediculous that they tell you to not use your phone for 12 to 16 hours when you install it. But when I told them about my problems they told me to not get the phone near anything warm for a week. You mean like my ear?!?!? They said yes, hold it away from your ear and do not put into your pocket. Incredible! They said the glass on the new IPhone 4 requires a longer cure time. Then stop selling the product until you fix the problem!!! You cannot expect people to not use their phone for a week. I asked for a refund and since it was past 45 days they said no. They suggested that I get a free replacement and sell it on Ebay?!?! Yea, like I want to pass this piece of crap onto someone else.  Seriously bad product and even worse customer service.

B004FN16DS|5.0|In Ha-Joon Chang's 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism, the \\"They\\" in the title are free-market ideologues, so this book could have been entitled \\"23 Things Free-Market Ideologues Don't Tell You about Capitalism.\\"  But, really, the book is organized as though the title is \\"23 Things Free-Market Ideologues Do Tell You about Their Particular Brand of Capitalism and Why Those 23 Things Are Wrong.\\"  I mention this just in case you were wondering how I lost my job drafting titles for books.     In each chapter, Professor Chang provides first what a free-market ideologue would say in a very short snippet, followed by his more lengthy response replete with historical and contemporary examples.  Having spoken to quite a few free-market ideologues in my time -- as a lawyer I move money from one place to another using guile, dirty tricks, and brute force so that the free-market ideologues for whom I work can count it before rolling around in it nude -- I can attest to the fact that free-market ideologues do, in fact, say almost all of the things that Professor Chang says they say, except they usually say them far more belligerently and not nearly as concisely.     Now, I know that Professor Chang is a globetrotting economist who is also a professor at a cosmopolitan European university, so he probably knows many more free-market ideologues than I do and has probably heard at least some of them say all of these 23 Things.  Nonetheless, I feel that I should mention that there are a few Things in Professor Chang's book that I have never heard any free-market ideologue say.  For instance, I have never heard a free-market ideologue say, \\"A well educated workforce is absolutely necessary for economic development\\" (Thing 17).  I have instead heard them say Things like, \\"People can educate themselves as much as they want as long as they don't do it with my money\\" and \\"You can get a Ph.D. in 'Making The Impossible Happen' and still be as dumb as a handful of nickels.\\"  I have also never heard a free-market ideologue say, as but one more example, we should strive for equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes (Thing 20).  I have, instead, heard free-market ideologues say such things as, \\"People can have as much equality as they want as long as they don't do it with my money\\" and \\"Shut up.\\"     It's also worth noting that, though you might surmise it from Professor Chang's credentials even if I did not, this book is international in scope and some of its Things primarily address issues relevant only (at least at the time of this review) to countries other than the United States except insofar as foreign policy and aid are concerned.  While this presented no problem for me, the only time I have heard free-market ideologues I know here in the United States discuss foreign matters, their universal arguments were limited to \\"Who Cares?\\" and \\"We should abolish all foreign aid except in the form of heavily outsourced invasions, preferably of oil-producing nations.\\"  So, again, at least here in the United States, there are Things in this book you may not hear a free-market ideologue say at all.     American free-market ideologues do say, oh, probably eighteen or nineteen of the Things in this book.  For each of these, Professor Chang provides a convincing, well-crafted, and concise response that, unfortunately, no free-market ideologue will ever read, which is why I think Professor Chang felt comfortable referring to them as \\"They\\" in his title.     As I note above, each of these chapters provides a thorough but brief initiation to its topics followed by a well-illustrated argument in which possible objections are handily addressed.  If you are like me and this is one of the first books you have ever read devoted entirely to economics that was not in graphic form and concerned only with a little rich boy who owned a robot maid, this will be your first introduction to some of these topics.  While that is fine, I caution you to diga little deeper before you let tangential issues in the book sway your personal financial decision-making.  As one example, Professor Chang discusses microfinance in Thing 15 and correctly states that microfinance and microcredit have never been demonstrated to lift their beneficiaries out of poverty.  Professor Chang further points out in a section hyperbolically entitled \\"The Grand Illusion\\" that unsubsidized microcredit can involve interest rates of forty or fifty percent (and much more in some countries).  Finally, Professor Chang notes that microfinance is often not used to fuel entrepreneurship, but is instead used to finance consumption.  All of that is true.  As Professor Chang mentions, \\"the problems [of microfinance] are too numerous to list here.\\"  So, apparently, were the benefits.  Plenty of evidence demonstrates that microfinance aids the economic stability of its beneficiaries.  Beneficiaries can save in times of abundance and borrow in times of hardship.  And, if you have ever, as I have, gotten a cash advance on your 28.9% credit card, paying ATM fees and a cash advance surcharge of two to five percent knowing full well that you would not be able to repay that debt until you graduated from law school, you know that forty to fifty percent interest is not so bad when it's all that stands between you and pizza, beer, condoms, and lottery tickets.  None of these points have anything to do with Professor Chang's thesis, which is that microfinance may, in fact, fail at its stated objectives: to lift people out of poverty and to instigate entrepreneurial successes in third-world countries.  But don't judge microfinance based solely on the brief treatment in Professor Chang's book.  He points out that stability and security -- usually provided by a viable safety net -- are crucial to worker flexibility, mobility, and risk-taking (Thing 21).  For some in the third world, microfinance is their only threadbare safety net.  Professor Chang does not pretend that this is an exhaustive treatise on tangential topics like microfinance.  So, whether you are thinking about getting involved in microfinance (Thing 15), building a supersonic transatlantic jet (Thing 12), or starting a factory in Burundi that produces nothing but bright ideas (Thing 9), don't let this book discourage you.  Do some additional research and live your dream.     While this book is largely complete, I do believe that Professor Chang would have done well to address a few other Things that free-market ideologues say, since they probably say some Things far more often than any of these 23 Things.  Things such as, \\"If it weren't for me, you would still be living in a homeless shelter and panhandling on the streets, son,\\"  or \\"Let's step out on the terrace, have a couple of cigars, and talk business, Mr. Vice President,\\" or \\"You're fired.\\"  Perhaps these points needn't be addressed directly, since Professor Chang provides a cogent conclusion to his book entitled \\"How to rebuild the world economy.\\"  There he writes that he won't \\"spell out all the detailed proposals required for the reconstruction of the world economy,\\" but will instead focus on eight principles.  The eight principles are thoughtful and rational, and all eight will make for fine, civil debate the next time I have a free-market economist over for a dinner party.  But I am still left with lingering questions.  When free-market ideology is so pervasive that anyone suggesting the slightest tweak is labeled a socialist, and when free-market ideologues control virtually all the wealth and power in much of the developed world (and certainly in all of the United States), what are the chances that thoughtfulness and rationality will prevail?  How do you convince someone that rational (or even irrational) self-interest and the accumulation of wealth are not the only motivational forces underlying human enterprise (Thing 5) when, in their wildest imaginings, they cannot conceive of any other inspiration?     That is, perhaps, a topic for a different book.  This is an excellent book that does what it sets out to do -- patiently refute 23 guiding principles of the most prevalent form of runaway capitalism -- in a mindful yet entertaining way.  I highly recommend it, in particular for readers like myself who know just how much they don't know.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Got a cd with a scratch. When I advised the seller, they promptly replaced it with a perfect one. Vary satisfied.
B004GYY714|5.0|Awesome app! I use it EVERYDAY! I don't have a working radio in my car, so I use this app and listen to the local sports radio stations in my city. FREE!
B000ESSTKQ|5.0|I love this album because I'm a real Vince Clarke fan and when I found out that it was available in SACD format I had to have it. Now if your an audiophile like me and you would like the SACD version you have to get the British import of the Deluxe Edition, but here's the catch, not all import Deluxe Edition's are SACD. (I went through about 3 of these until I found one)The SACD logo will be on the back of the CD box if it is an SACD. The SACD sounds great (comparable to the 5.1 mixes on the DVD) The biggest surprise is during the song \\"I just can't get enough\\" where the chorus appears in the back of the room! as well as more surprises in store for you.<br />Enjoy!
B00138J3LA|5.0|For me, this is the album that started it all.  Before this, I thought I was into music.  I listened to what was on the radio, mostly AM and top 40, pop and what I thought was rock.  Then, a friend of mine, put side one, track one, Hoedown, on for me.  I sat between the speakers and my mind was completely blown.  I could barely figure out what I was listening to.  It sounded as if I was being given a glimpse into the mind of a genius going stark raving mad.  Straddling the line between brilliance and lunacy, classical and avant guard art rock, was just three musicians, famous enough (barely), and egomaniacal enough (Oh yeah!) to name their band by their last names only.  This track set me on a journey of discovery into the heart of progressive rock, then a staple of FM underground radio and the major concert circuit.  At the time, I was not old enough to go to concerts on my own, and my parents were not going to tolerate attending music made by mad men, so all I had was this vinyl triple LP.    There is nearly the whole history of recorded music poured into this package, from classical to ragtime, jazz to rock and blues, ballads to ear splitting Hendrix on keyboards, all accompanied, and DRIVEN by the absolute percussive perfection of Carl Palmer, among the finest drummers to ever grace the stage.      People who point out that critics hated ELP, should be reminded that critics also hated Led Zeppelin's first three or four albums, and that \\"Afternoon Delight\\" won the Starland Vocal Band (or whatever they were called) best new group of the year, while ELP never got nearly that much mainstream recognition.  Who can blame them?  ELP was making music for fans, not critics.  Keith \\"there is no substitute\\" Emerson was hacking up organs with knives and destroying them with more gusto than Pete Townsend and Hendrix put together.  This was punk and art fused into one.  Proggresive and fearless to a fault.  Their first five albums (ELP, Tarkus, Pictures at an Exhibition, Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery) are all masterpieces of the genre, and this live album summarizes and epitomizes the live tour that supported Brain Salad Surgery, just when they were peaking, selling out arenas and blowing the collective minds of the post hippy rock fans.    This album led me to discovery rest of the prog rock universe inhabited by Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull and King Crimson, and I have never looked back.  If nothing else download Hoedown and tell me that the Moog synthesizer solo doesn't make you want to listen to it over and over again at full blast.  Did I mention Greg Lake is one of the finest bass players and singers of all time?  This is the real deal.  Enjoy.
B004SS0884|5.0|Wow this is her Best Album Since Blackout that was under ratted by everyone its all dance all the way and get the Deluxe Edition \\"Selfish\\" and \\"He about to Lose Me\\" are amazing
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|I love Genesis!  I received my package on time and in perfect condition! The bf loved his throwback cds!  Thanks!!!
B004LFO0FG|5.0|I enjoyed this album listening to it online the other day. I must say, it is just as good as Blackout and Circus. She has created a stunning collection that is unique among her body of work. It is her most united, yet diverse set of songs, with each tune offering the listener something special. The songs effortlessly flow from one to the next, united by both their dynamic beats and their themes of love and desires. The songs are about how she felt were destined to be embraced and loved by her fans. This album is an intoxicating, bewitching enchantress who entices those near down an irresistibly seductive path.
0385528752|4.0|I listen to audio books mostly non fiction this is in my top 10 must read. What he tells you makes sense you just never put it together like he does.
B004SS0884|1.0|what are you guys listening to that like this mess....this is not Britney's finest and in my opinion this is not better than Blackout either. This made my ears hurt...when does she actually sing?

B002ZG99A4|5.0|This movie is just motivation on steroids!!! Could possibly be one of the greatest action movies ever. My mustache definitely approves this spectacular picture. [...]
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had these for a little over a month now and love them.  The sound is great, hookup is simple, and they are very comfortable.  No background hiss(nothing wireless in vicinity) for me.  One other thing I like about these is that the chat works much better w/them.  I can hear my friends and they can hear me very clearly.  I got these on sale for $170 and would highly recommend them.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|While not as coherently mind-blowing as Sgt. Pepper's, this album is nonetheless packed full of songs that are classics now, but were daringly innovative in their day. Rubber Soul falls right in the middle of the Beatles' career, foreshadowing what was to come. It has one foot ankle-deep in their early pop music, and the other foot is dipping its toes in the experimental pool that would later transform music as we know it. No matter which era of The Beatles evolution you prefer, you'll find lots to admire (and sing along with) on this album.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|This CD came on time. It is in perfect conditions. I love it and listen to it a lot. James Horner is a great composer!
0984061401|1.0|I purchased this book to finally read for myself what Keynes actually had to say.  I started reading with an open mind but found the writing to be obtuse, and found the theories so riddled with dubious assumptions that they have little, if any, application in the real world.  I also cannot imagine this book being used as required reading, or as a textbook, except possibly in a logic class as an example of faulty reasoning.  If you are looking for a book on economic theory that can teach you something that you can actually use and apply, I recommend looking elsewhere.
030746363X|5.0|Tim has done his research and knows what he is talking about. I have been working out for over 10 years and I thought I knew everything. Tim introduced me to new ideas and they worked. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B0002B15XI|2.0|though i thought this movie was OK,in my opinion it pales in comparison  to the Television series.i have nothing against any of the  actors,most of whom were just staring out or barely known at the  time,and are now well known.but,in the TV series,the actor are a better fit  for the characters.the movie isn't as clever as the TV show  either,although there are some moments of dialogue brilliance.Elliot  Gould and Donald Sutherland do have good chemistry together though,and  that counts for something.however,something else that really bugged me  was the opening theme song.in the series,it's all instrumental.in the  movie,we get to hear the lyrics which to me,overpower the piece,and  take away its impact.plus,the words don't really make sense and they  don't fit with the melody.that may seem like a minor point,but to me  it's a major faux pas.as for the movie itself,it's not horrible by any  means.it's just no masterpiece.for me MASH (the movie)is a 2.5/5
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I was not sure about watching this movie.  After<br />all, how interesting can it be to see three people<br />trapped in a chair lift for the duration of the<br />movie?<br /><br />What made this movie more real was that it was<br />plausible that such a mishap could happen to anyone<br />including you the viewer.  It is not one of those<br />zombie, vampire, or any other fictitious character<br />horror story.<br /><br />I did not know any of the actors/actresses in the<br />movie, but they were all very good and they delivered.<br />At times the script was little slow, but they did the best<br />under the circumstances.<br /><br />Check out the bonus material about making of this movie.<br />It gives you a different perspective about the details<br />of how they made the movie (eg the wolf scene).
B00006DEFA|5.0|my roommate and i both enjoyed this film on the life of Wolfgang  Amadeus Mozart.it's basically told from the perspective of Antonio  Salieri(F. Murray Abraham).the movie may or may not be historically  accurate,but so what.it isn't a documentary.it's a Hollywood film,so of  course dramatic liberties have been taken.the point is,it is a  beautiful looking film.the music is superb.the acting is first rate.the  costumes are exquisite.the tension is at times palpable and there is  comic relief.Tom Hulce doesn't get a lot of recognition as an actor,but  he is certainly brilliant here as Mozart.Jeffrey Jones has a great turn  as well,as Emperor Joseph II.Roy Dotrice is also a standout as Mozart's  Father Leopold.all told,this a remarkable achievement. 4.7/10
B003ZSJ212|5.0|OK For all that grew up with star wars and for all that have been introduced to it along the way. If you think about what you have going on in your life and then think is there anything better than getting to kick back and watch all 6 movies back to back in one day with the Highest resolution and best quality. I say Fire up the Popcorn maker and start your attack run.  And yes i remember watching A New Hope in the theater.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|Once again the kindle book cost more than the real book. This in one of those books that is probably better in paper back form anyway. I do not lend my kindle out.
B001IHJ97E|4.0|This was Natalie Wood's final film and she died during the filming.  It was finished without her, but I still love the film.  The premise is about being able to experience other people's dreams and experiences.  Now who hasn't wanted to do that?   It is definitely not the best Science Fiction movie ever made, but it is good and easy to watch.  I've watched it numerous times and still enjoy it.  It is what it is, but it is very enjoyable.
B004NSULHM|1.0|The new radiohead CD is the Biggest Disapointment Ever!  After the stellar masterpiece inrainbows album, this one is a boring noodling mess.  I was looking forward to this release as an innovative leap forward from inrainbows--or at least as good.  Instead, it sounds like a bunch of B-side throwaways.  YAWN  Come on guys...you can do better than this.  I want my $8 back.
B00000G3I2|5.0|If you are thinking about buying this film, I urge you to do so.  This is one of the best ensemble cast films out there.  A group of eight college friends reunite 20 years later for the funeral of one of their inner-circle who has committed suicide.  It is engaging to watch the interaction between the characters.  This is well written and the soundtrack is to die for.  This film is worthy of being watched over and over again.
B0036OS3PQ|5.0|Bought the Crocs Women's Winter Boot in plum after much research on winter boots. We had a bad winter here in the Northeast this year and I really had to have boots.  I am so glad that I picked these: they are comfortable, warm, keep the snow/wet out and will also be great for rainy days. I read other reviews on going up a size and followed suit. I normally wear a 9.5 / 10 - but bought the 11 based on the actual croc sizing chart.  The are a teeny bit big - but with thicker socks they fit great. I think the smaller size would have been too small. I have gotten so many compliments on the color as well.  Great investment.  I have never been disappointed from the Croc brand.  Great product!
B004M6BQ9W|5.0|What an entertaining movie!  Strictly for adults mind you.....but really great full of great dance sequences and singing.......Singing ...I certainly didn't  know Christina Aquilera could sing like that!  Wow.... Since I'm not into pop stars, I've never heard her sing or perform.  And Cher still has it to!  Great film.

B004QYZATW|2.0|A very beautiful locale and that was it. Around the 3rd or 4th time Jolie enters a room (which seems to happen every 15 mins or so) and watching everyting come to a halt as men, women, musicians, dogs, cats and artwork stop to ogle her, it just became silly. The plot twist (if that is what you would call it) made me think ok, that's great, but who cares?<br /><br />I really can't say anymore, I have wasted enough time with this film already.
B002ZG976U|5.0|this movie is awesome... best \\"musical\\" type movie for this generation! i loved Cher and Christina... awesome performances by both! HIGHLY recommend!! :)
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I was also getting the Amazon Appstore error so I made a backup with Titanium Backup, uninstalled and restored the backup (app only).  The error hasn't completely gone away but it doesn't shut down after it now so I am able to use it.  It is impressive when it works at identifying a song but only worked with some of the more popular songs I tested.  I'm wondering if it will work as well if I ever need to use it for real.

B004E547D8|2.0|I will keep this short. I bought the $12.99 Red Bluray mistakingly thinking that it would contain the DTS HDMA 5.1 audio track. But no, instead it has a Dolby Digital 5.1 compressed mix which falls well and truly below the audio mix on the 'collectors edition'. It is criminal to release a Bluray with a down sampled audio mix. So I started watching this movie feeling angry which probably did not help my initial impression. Overall, I thought it was a reasonable fun outing but nothing more than poking fun at the real action movies of the 80s. However, it is always great to see the ever likeable John Malkovich on the screen and I thought Helen Mirren did a wonderful job as the gun wielding lady.    All in all 1/5 for releasing a bluray with a dirty old dolby digital track and 3/5 for the film.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a great knife and a great value.  I figured I would make my review more of a comparison between two very popular survival and camping knives in order to hopefully give some insight that a regular singular review could not address very easily.  I also own the very popular but more expensive ESEE-5 survival knife (~$140) and these two knives are both perfect in many ways and in the ways one knife is comparatively weak the other is comparatively strong.     I love the sheaths that come with both knives. Both these knives have the same length blades, same metal composition (1095 steel), almost the same tempering, the same thickness (quarter inch), and the same basic overall weight. They are both coated knives, but the ESEE-5 has a much more significant and harder wearing coating. The ESEE-5 has a pommel point at the handle end to make it great for breaking car window glass, but that very feature makes it harder to use a stick as a baton (at least if you want the stick to last very long before falling apart) to carefully hammer the tip of the knife into something hard. The Becker Campanion has a nice flat pommel end that could easily be used with a rock, stick, etc to hammer the tip of the knife into something hard like a coconut for instance.      In my opinion, the blade of the Becker Campanion is shaped a little better than the ESEE-5 for cutting vegetables etc. when camping out, but the ESEE-5 has a better blade shape for a true defense or survival knife.  If you look at the tips of the knives the ESEE-5 has a much more noticeable point vs. the Campanion which would make the ESEE-5 better and more efficient as a stabbing tool in a survival defensive situation.  The main benefit I see of the more rounded tip shape of the Becker Campanion knife is that in combination with the lighter plastic handle scales the Campanion has vs. the ESEE-5's solid and heavier micarta scales and the small metal cutouts under the handle scales whereas the ESEE-5 is solid metal under the handles is that the center of balance is farther forward on the Campanion knife. This makes the Campanion a noticeably better light chopping tool and it feels better in the hand for that purpose vs the ESEE-5.  This would make the Campanion a more enjoyable choice in my opinion for tasks like building an emergency shelter out of tree limbs and branches.      One drawback to the Campanion is that the handles are very slippery especially when wet.  The micarta handles on the ESEE-5 provide great grip when wet or dry.  The solution I found that worked very well to rough up the Campanion grips was to take a soldering iron and to gently touch the hot tip to the surface of the handles and press and melt little dots into the handles all over.  That greatly increased the grip without weakening the hollow handles like melting or scratching long grip lines could do.  Adding Loktite to the handles is a good idea as well to keep the handle screws from slowly loosening over time.      The only other comparison difference that I noticed is that the handles of the ESEE-5 require an allen wrench on each side (2 separate wrenches) of the knife at the same time to loosen and remove the scales for thorough cleaning etc. The Campanion knife has an allen head on one end and a nut that is held from turning by the handle scale itself on the other side.  That means the handles can be removed easily in the field using only one single allen wrench. Overall both knives are great, and I use and love both and consider both knives worth the price, but there are differences that might matter to you and I pointed out all the ones I have noticed. I hope this review helped.
B000GPIPD8|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my son's birthday (age 14). He's a rabid Black Keys fan, as is my whole family. This CD is bluesy and a fantastic addition to our collection. Only complaint is that there isn't more of it.
B000CCD0HQ|3.0|This wasn't the version of this LP that I wanted. It was re-recorded (although they did a good job of re-producing the original LP) - it was listed as the original LP and the truth was it just wasn't the original LP
B004SBX112|1.0|Do not buy this! It is a waste of money. Actually, it's worse than that, as you wont get the updates! Free version from Android market is better. And besides, it's not ad free, it advertises Amazon appstore and angry birds rio evertime you hit menu.
B001U88814|3.0|I loved the idea of these cause I wear Crocs a lot and needed something for winter.  They are warm and snug and comfy, except don't make the mistake I did...wearing them without socks.  First of all, the lining pulls out when you pull your feet out.  That's a pain.  Not to mention, they will get smelly quick.  I figured I could remove the lining and wash it, but then couldn't get the lining back onto the buttons.  So, after only a few weeks, the wonderful shoes are worthless to me.  I'll buy more, just won't be wearing them as house slippers, without socks.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Great game improvement on the original but I believe it is far too easy. Also lacking \\"hidden\\" levels (Golden Eggs). Doing the golden fruit would be fine if it unlocked something but it really serves no purpose.     I enjoy the unique levels at the end of each episode each with something special offered (except the first section). New birds are welcome but I wish instead of a Angry Birds 1.5 it offered more. Not to mention the latest updated only gives you half the zone which is upsetting to wait for a release and get only half of it.     If Rovio keeps at it, would reconsider score, but I really feel they are getting lazy...
B004G6009K|5.0|Pixar aside, Disney hasn't made a movie this good since the renaissance 90's when we got classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan.<br /><br />Tangled is the story of Rapunzel and her long, lustrous, climbable hair, but like any iconic Disney adaptation there's plenty of twists and turns along the way.  The characters are all endlessly interesting, especially the two animal side-kicks who absolutely steal the show (despite being mute.)  The music is good, perhaps not '90s good, but still very enjoyable.  Mother Gothel is among Disney's best villains and her deliciously wicked song \\"Mother Knows Best\\" deserves to be among the greatest hits of all Disney musical numbers.<br /><br />The animation is, of course, breathtaking to behold--especially on Blu Ray.  The attention to detail and setting is what sets Disney apart from other computer animations.  Like the Beast's library or Belle walking through town, there are an endless number of images that will remain frozen in your mind for weeks, months, and probably years at a time.  I collect a lot of Disney movies but I still consider myself somewhat of a snob, if it's not during the Walt era (or one of the better '90s releases) I have a hard time justifying it for my collection.  With Tangled however, it is a no brainer.  This is the stuff of an instant classic, it'll be around for a long time.  You might as well take advantage of it now.

B000067QMD|5.0|I have Avent bottles, but not an Avent pump, so I did not get any storage bottles.  Instead of paying $25 for a storage set, these plus the bottle screw rings cost me a total of $10, and work perfectly.  I would definitely recommend to anyone pumping and using Avent bottles (I like being able to use the 9oz size for storage, because they are much larger than what my pump came with).
B004SBX112|5.0|I had the free ad-supported version from tge android market and it didn't run too smoothly, but this runs smooth as silk for the majority of the time. My OG Droid may have something to do with performance, but it runs great still.
B004SBX112|5.0|Angry Birds Seasons takes the beloved Angry Birds gameplay and adds a seasonal twist to the art. Seasons does player harder than the original, but there are far fewer levels.  Stick with the original (or get the FREE version of Seasons) if you haven't completed it yet.
B003O86FMW|3.0|i feel like this book was almost a repeat of the first.  By now I`m tired of the main character`s inter dialog and indecisivenss.  the first half of the book is kat looking back on past events.  it`s as it this book solely exists so that there is a trilogy instead of a two parter.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Ok, I was really skeptical about this series.  Sure, sure, my dopey geek fantasy role playing friends couldn't stop praising it, making me want to read it even less.  Then I saw HBO was doing it as a series, AND the Fantasy Flight card game was getting huge reviews and I figured I'd better give it a second look.<br /><br />At first I was put off by the \\"Ser this and that\\" and the \\"heraldic\\" prose, but after a few chapters I got to know the characters and I must say I was BLOWN AWAY.  This darned Martin dude can really turn a phrase.  The world he has created is fully formed, and the characters are 3 dimensional (well, the main characters, anyway.  He gives names to thousands of bit players who could get by with just a description like \\"a courtier entered the room\\" instead of \\"Frogbottom Leafhelm entered the room\\".  Once you get used to this style, however, it does add to the ambience but it can be confusing who you're supposed to be paying attention to.)<br /><br />Anyway, this story takes some great and unexpected turns, and Martin uses some very advanced techniques to move the story forward quickly.  I liked this series so much I bought it for my best friend's kindle account because he's too lazy to download it himself but I think he'll enjoy it if I hand it to him on a silver platter.<br /><br />I love this book, and the series, and I've grown to basically hate the fantasy genre over the last few years because I've gotten burned buying stuff that looked interesting but stunk up the room.  Songs of Fire and Ice: Game of Thrones is a very notable and welcome exception to the loads of excrement that call themselves \\"Fantasy Novels\\" out there today (oh, don't go all ballistic on me...I know there's some good stuff still out there, I'm just being hyperbolic for effect. :-))<br /><br />your pal,<br /><br />Lobsta<br /><br />PS: If you like this, do check out the Fantasy Flight card game, also sold by Amazon.com.  It kind of rules!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|totally entertaining movie. my husband pointed out there are a few things that don't make sense in the movie, but who cares. I got this from the library and didn't have much expectation and it turned out to be very good for my standard. great cast.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|It almost feels like the tidal wave of (positive) hype surrounding miss Britney Spears has never been bigger - which is saying something for a woman entering the eleventh year of her career. Coming off of two back-to-back number one singles, Britney's latest effort is poised to be her most cohesive offering yet, harkening back to the brilliant fluidity of Blackout, which was sadly neglected given Brit's personal situation at the time.     Much like Blackout, it's hard to criticize any one song as particularly terrible because the sound is so consistent throughout. Virtually none of the songs break free from the pulsing dance power of lead singles 'Hold It Against Me' and 'Till The World Ends', meaning Britney basically has her pick of tunes to make into major dance floor stompers. If you're a fan of those two tracks, you'll like the rest of the album.     By the same token, the consistency also makes it a bit hard to really isolate and fall in love with individual tunes, or determine what exactly should be single-worthy. The most unique songs include the light, fizzy, mindless flow of 'How I Roll' and the will.i.am collaboration 'Big Fat Bass', which references the music maverick's solo effort more than the Peas. It's an album to adore across the board, versus a pack of singles scattered amongst filler - and that's not really a bad thing. Literally though, the album is wall-to-wall energetic ; Britney doesn't warble her way through any soul-searching ballads, and she's finally keyed into what her fans respond to the best: powerful party tracks.    In terms of the bonus tunes, they're surprisingly in line with the rest of the album, and could have just as easily been swapped out for one or two of the less dynamic tunes on Femme Fatale - in particular thrummer-in-overdrive 'Don't Keep Me Waiting', and 'He About To Lose Me', a jungle-drum-infused track that draws inspiration from 'I'm A Slave 4 U'.     As for her musicality, it's a moot point by now. If you're a Brit fan, chances are you don't care how often she's auto-tuned (a trend very much in her favour), or whether she co-wrote the lyrics (she didn't). It's all about the slick production and signature Britney attitude that make every song leap off your playlist and get stuck in your head. At this point, Britney's voice is basically a tool in her producers' arsenal of hit-making wizardry, and by the sounds of Femme Fatale, we shouldn't want it any other way.

George (Matt Damon) is a psychic with an ability to speak to the dead loved ones of those he touches. And young Marcus (Frankie and George McLaren) from London loses a dear family member in a tragic accident, and begins to search for answers to what happens after someone dies.  Each of them will begin a journey that will converge in their search for what may happen in the hereafter.<br /><br />The first scene of a violent and catastrophic tsunami is certainly the most moving and tragic in the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is dismal and extremely slow-moving. Bouncing around the three main storylines, it's obvious from the start what will bring the three characters together. But the journey is painfully slow. To make matters worse, over a third of the film is in French (with English subtitles).<br /><br />While the acting was spot on, it wasn't enough to make the film worthwhile. The three storylines obviously connect, but without much resolution at the end. It was a long build-up to a fizzled, lackluster ending. Clint Eastwood directs this strange, monotonous film with seemingly little direction.  Fans of drama, with a paranormal twist, who don't mind reading their movies and watching stagnant scenes (like Matt Damon eating meals by himself) may be interested in this one. But it was definitely not one that I can recommend.

B004R92PYE|5.0|Someone said this album was a combo of the first two PATD albums, and that assessment was right on-I'd call it a 75/25 split on Fever/Pretty.Odd and is near perfect.  It takes the best of both albums (great musicality and quicker beats) and gives me more music I can't wait to wear out.  It's one of those albums that you love the first time you hear.  If you even remotely like PATD, you will not regret buying this album.

B00012QM86|4.0|Schindler's List gives us three major stories and a host of minor ones. First and foremost, it tells the tale of the Holocaust, presenting new images of old horrors. These are as ghastly and realistic as anything previously filmed, and Spielberg emphasizes the brutality of the si... read moretuation by not pulling punches when it comes to gore. The blood, inky rather than crimson in stark black-and-white, fountains when men and women are shot in the head or through the neck.    The second story is that of Oskar Schindler, the Nazi businessman who saved 1200 Jews from death. Schindler starts out as a self-centered manufacturer, concerned only about making money. He hires Jews because they're cheap, not because he likes them. But his perspective changes, and he risks losing everything to save as many lives as he can. His eventual lament that he couldn't save more is heartbreaking.    The third story belongs to Amon Goeth, the Nazi commander of Krakow, a man who teeters on the brink of madness. Despite his intense hatred for Jews, he is inexplicably attracted to his Jewish housekeeper, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Disgusted by his feelings, he lashes out at her with a display of violence that is almost Scorsese-like in its blunt presentation. As written, Goeth could easily have become a conscienceless monster, but Spielberg works carefully to show unexpected depth and complexity to his character.    Often, the experiences of the minor characters provide the most lasting images. Helen's story is memorable, as is the plight of young Danka Dresner and her mother as they strive to avoid death while staying together. There's a Jewish couple that marries in the Plaszow camp, even though their chances of survival are dim, and a Rabbi who survives a close encounter with a Nazi gun.    As this story relates to World Religions, I feel that the Jews in Germany was targeted because of their religous beliefs but we must all remember that anyone who wasn't of German blood was a target for extermination by the Nazi's. Jews were targeted because they were easily indentified because of the color of they hair and the darkened skin tone. Their peaceful disposition made them vulnerable also.

B004A8ZWT2|2.0|The Tourist was one of those movies for me that I kept thinking to myself through most of the entirety of the film, \\"What in the world is going on here?\\". And because of that, it was a movie I had to finish to find out what happened or else it would drive me crazy. I gave it two stars because the colors and pictures were stunning - especially of Venice (I also adored Elise's wardrobe). Unfortunately though, I don't know how this was nominated for so many awards... maybe just because of famous actors? Who knows. If you must watch this film, do so if only to enjoy a great wardrobe and very high quality pictures.

It is so well written and you dont want to put it down until you finish it. When you think that you have it all figured out Larson throws a curve ball and changes everything. You wont regret reading this book, its really worth your time.

1416550534|5.0|Single sentence summary: Grace was once a young housemaid in Riverton and was there when a family friend commits suicide but Grace tells a different story of devastating betrayals within the Hartford family.<br /><br />I listened to this book and while it took me two tries to get into it, I ended up trapped and didn't want to stop listening until it was over. The voice given to Grace to tell this tragic tale was beautiful and engaging. Hannah and Emmeline (the two Hartford sisters) change as Grace's own perception of them change throughout the novel and you see them grow and how Grace as a character grows. I found it a wonderful way to show how these three girls are changed by the world as they come of age and then the tragic events that pull them apart. Emmeline at most times felt like a child to me while Hannah is grows into a women soured by the lose of her childhood dreams.<br /><br />The events that happen within Riverton were slowly unfolded and you couldn't help but fall in love with the characters that lived there. I really enjoyed the story that Grace told, both her own and that of the two sisters. The changes from present day to the past didn't bother me at all and I think that is because I was expecting it. I had issues with that when I listened to The Forgotten Garden (another wonderful read) but when I realize that was going to happen in this book, I had no problems following the story. The narrator was wonderful and helped bring the characters to life.<br /><br />This book was a wonderful listen and I really enjoyed it. I give it 4.25 Stars.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I had K-9 installed for a long time and it's better to the stock HTC e-mail app by quite a bit. The look of the notifications and the usability of the message list is far superior.      My two complaints would be that you don't have the ability to set \\"peak times\\" and \\"off-peak\\" times to vary the background synch.  You can work around this with other apps.  My other complaint is that I can't stand the look/feel of the widget.  Basically, it's the dog and it doesn't match the look/feel of any of my other messaging widgets.  Small complaint but it bugged me enough that I eventually uninstalled the app.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|What can be said about the most influential album in Rock history without stepping on someone else's feet? I could go into tangent rants about how over a 20 year time span Eddie Vedder and co. pulled me from a pool of despair, but this is not about me, so I'll try and leave me out.    This album was an introduction of many things to me. I was basically into Pop music prior to Ten, with an occasional trek into Heavy Metal. Looking back at that, I found that although Pop and Metal were good, everything seemed so fake. Ten came off to me like reading a newspaper. Every song seemed to come straight from headlines, Jeremy was a testament to that.    Another thing this album introduced to me was the \\"Two Headed Monster\\" that is Stone Gossard and Mike McCready. They really play off each other so well. I never really looked at the idea of Right Guitar/ Left Guitar as it's presented in Alternative music. I thought Hetfield/ Hammett or Slash/ Stradlin were tough, but Stone and Mike have them beat hands down. Jeff Ament rounds it out with his remarkable bass compositions.    The only thing that throws me off is who I should give drumming credit to. There have been so many of them, but that has never been a problem, because they have always been phenomenal.    This collection will always be a favorite of mine, because of the inclusion of the superb demos for \\"State of Love and Trust\\" and \\"Breath\\", two faves of mine also. I still can't believe it's been 20 years, but what a good 20 it has been.
0756404738|3.0|I'll keep it short and to the point. The book was good but overall I was letdown. Waiting for years for the release of this book had nothing to do with the let down, it simply wasn't nearly as good as NOTW. My problem with the book was that nothing of true importance happened. In 1,000 pages the only thing I was left with was that Kvothe managed to bulster his reputation either through true events or embellishment of said events. I mean really what happened in this book? He killed some bandits, pissed off the Maer, learned a small amount of how to be a legendary fighter, and spent time with a fae.  Each of these events was long and drawn out. I felt like each segment could have been cut down as well as some action added. As other reviews said, I'm left feeling like I know little more with Kvothe then before. That being said I will buy the third book in a heartbeat even though it will probably be four years before the release.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I heard Adele sing for the first time by accident while watching the Jimmy Kimmel show... A few days later went to her website and sampled her videos and some other songs...and I was hooked.  Purchased her \\"21\\" CD and I simply can't stop listening to it.    Adele, aside of being beautiful, has a very strong and extremely versatile voice.  Her songs take the listener from her feelings of revenge to total forgiveness, from her confusion and desperation from not knowing what went wrong to hope that love will come back to her some day.    Although the songs are about the the same \\"broken heart/heart ache/still in love with the wrong person\\", the music and the way sings them make the album be very entertaining and upbeat. Different from, and very opposite to any regular \\"sappy/cheese/boring ballad\\" type of album.    Great album all around.

B003ITDN86|4.0|Screaming Bloody Murder is a big step in the right direction for Sum 41. It is stylistically similar to Chuck, but this new album has a bit more originality to it, not to mention more developed songs.<br /><br />The first six tracks are exceptional. \\"Reason To Believe\\" is one of the band's best songs, and \\"Jessica Kill\\" is worthy of repeated listens. If this was a 6-track EP it would have been amazing. But as it is, the album shifts pace in the middle, and gives way to a bunch of well-performed but less than stellar songs that really try hard to grab the listener, but just can't manage to accomplish that feat consistently.<br /><br />The band is in fine form; this is by far their most cohesive effort as a band. And lyrically, it is by far their best. So overall, this is a darn good record. Could have been great if the songs in the middle were better, but there are major strides taken by Sum 41 here that give hope for their future. If they can expand on the sonic template offered here while offering the type of energetic hooks offered up on \\"All Killer No Filler,\\" then they will have finally arrived as a band. Now, rather than at any other point in their career, does this seem more possible than ever before. They are a force to be reckoned with.
B000002J03|5.0|Most Led Zep fans rate this as either their first,second, or third favorite Led Zep album. Alot of times Led Zep IV falls down on the list because it is called many different names (IV , 4, Untitled, Ruins, ZOSO, Symbols, Pealing Paint On Building). Most The Jeff Beck Group fans don't like this album because before it came out TJBG fans felt that TJBG was the better G. Then this album came out and the world changed. It knocked The Beatles Abbey Road off the top of the charts and maybe toward thoughts of retirement. AM radio began playing Whole Lotta Love along with every inch of Robert Plant's love. Guitar solos, squeezing lemons, drum solos, juices running and questions about what is and what should never be filled the album's grooves with sounds that still amaze new listeners.  If you plan on dying with more than $10 in the bank, use it now to buy this album.  If you have some more, get Led Zep 4 and Physical Graffiti as well.
B00005MP58|4.0|The movie itself is great.   What I was disappointed in was the picture quality. In different scenes throughtout the movie, the whiteness of the background was so bright you could hardly see the people's faces. The copy I got was a brand new still in the shrink wrap copy, so it was not the seller's fault - it was in the reproduction of the movie from the manufacturer.

B004L49K20|5.0|I bought the 15 track deluxe edition here and the 17 track uber deluxe edition at that truly dreadful big blue box retail establishment that dare not speak its name. If you 15-trackers feel like a fool for not taking the plunge for the extra two tracks: Early Summer Nerves and Too Close to The Sun, don't. They're good, really good, but not essential. While the rest of the album is an urgent, cohesive, modern work of genius that recalls their best, first two albums; the two bonus tracks sound like leftovers from the latter eras of the band. Too Close To The Sun is long, sweeping, has a great guitar solo and a beat that would have fit nicely on Notorious. Early Summer Nerves is a sexy song that could have propped up Liberty or Medazzaland: tons of synth, Nick (Rhodes) at night type stuff. The packaging is the exact same as the 15-track, save for a cardboard wraparound sleeve that corrects the tracklist. Remove the sleeve, you actually have an incorrect tracklist there to greet you.<br /><br />Now if you bought the initial 9 track version, or the 14 track regular edition, should you fret? Heck yeah.<br /><br />For you 9 trackers, you are really missing out. Sure two of the five additional tracks are very short orchestral instrumentals, but they add a sweeping, over the top crescendo to the proceedings that this masterpiece deserves. The other three tracks are epic. Plus, you're missing out on the artwork. As you'll learn on the disposable DVD, Nick Rhodes sought out a gifted artist, Clunie Reid and had her re-interpret some original photos of the band and partying girls. Nary a Nagel in sight. Combined with the tri-fold-out sleeve and embossed cover, it's a gorgeous package. Granted, you'll fight like a bear in a beehive to pry the darn discs out of the tight cardboard lips.<br /><br />Now you 14-trackers are missing out on an album highlight: Networker Nation is a massive rock song that would have killed on Seven and the Ragged Tiger. Great beat, awesome guitars, massive chorus - Andy Taylor must be kicking himself he left the band this early... again.<br /><br />Here's hoping the BB bonus tracks, and the Japan-only b-sides Boys Keep Swinging (cover) and This Lost Weekend come out as MP3 tracks soon.<br /><br />Welcome back Duran Duran. But next time, please, just one all-inclusive version so that all of your fans can get the great music they deserve.ive chorus - Andy Taylor must be kicking himself he left the band this early... again.<br /><br />Here's hoping the BB bonus tracks, and the Japan-only b-sides Boys Keep Swinging (cover) and This Lost Weekend come out as MP3 tracks soon.<br /><br />Welcome back Duran Duran.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|I enjoyed this. It's a clever, sophisticated political thriller. All the acting was solid, including Kim Cattrall, who I didn't recognize at first with that accent. It's a movie that quietly progresses, builds tension, respects the viewer's intelligence, and has a Hitchcock vibe to the lighting and music.    The ending is good, too. Surprising.
B00005JNQS|5.0|its not very noticeable but this movie does have some adult humor in it.. between the scenes of \\"making the baby\\" and a cross dressing fender.. it is very funny but not really a movie a parent with a child who is questioning everything should have their child watch.. unless you are willing to answer.. \\"mommy/daddy why is that funny? what does that mean?\\" but over all it is a good movie and brought lots of laughs

Real built sets, stages, costumes, models, creating aliens and the entire struggle to make the whole movie believable.  You can see all the hard work behind the great success.  I would love to read a similar book about the making of The Return of the Jedi.

I've been down this path before...\\"<br /><br />\\"Come with me.\\"<br /><br />\\"What will make your movie different? Most movies look good during the trailers because they show all of the best bits. But few are able to deliver on that promise. Very few.\\"<br /><br />\\"thornhill, come with me. Follow me to this little village I have created for the film. It could be an old German village. It could be in Eastern Europe. It could be in old Russia. It could be many things. This is the beauty of my little village; because the film is based on a fairy tale, I can and will keep things fairly enigmatic.\\"<br /><br />\\"But that is part of the problem. If you are creating a fictional world, it needs to look real. Your village looks like a set.\\"<br /><br />\\"Most films are made on sets... Won't you come with me?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, but...\\"<br /><br />\\"Come with me. My film is good. You will enjoy it.\\"<br /><br />\\"...Most films are adequately able to disguise the sets. They pay a lot of money to make everything look as real as possible. You paid a lot of money to make everything look like a set. Your fable needs a distinctive time and place to ground it in reality, to make it seem believable and real.\\"<br /><br />\\"Come with me...\\"<br /><br />\\"Just because you are adapting a fairytale does not mean your screenplay has license to be subpar. I understand you are adapting something...\\"<br /><br />\\"Won't you come with me? Take my hand. I will lead you away from the sorry state of the multiplex....\\"<br /><br />\\"...That was probably 10 or 20 pages originally into a film that runs about 100 minutes, creating a lot of story to fill, a lot of dialogue to create. But if you don't have the ideas to create a feature-length story, don't do it. Simply repeating phrases or ideas over and over again does not create suspense. You need to create characters and let them grow throughout the course of the story.\\"<br /><br />\\"Are you thornhill?\\"<br /><br />\\"It seems like your screenwriter David Johnson (\\"Orphan\\", the upcoming sequel to \\"Clash of the Titans\\" (Don't get me started on that one)) becomes bored and simply can't be bothered to come up with any new ideas. Did he have a quota of pages to fill? Even ideas and situations are repeated. I can see the value in repeating a small number of these, for instance, showing us how Reverend Solomon's (Gary Oldman) Trojan Elephant works. And then putting one of the lovers in the contraption should create considerable suspense. But somehow, somewhere, the suspense is lost and even this moment falls flat.\\"<br /><br />\\"Are you thornhill?<br /><br />\\"Are you thornhill?\\"<br /><br />\\"I understand why you were chosen to helm this film. You made the first \\"Twilight\\" film and helped to create a franchise. But does your interpretation of \\"Red Riding Hood\\" have to seem like a sequel to the uber-popular Vampire saga? You even have three brooding, fairly attractive young people at the center of the story.\\"<br /><br />\\"Come with me. Are you thornhill?\\"<br /><br />\\"But the number one priority for you should have been to find better actors. Amanda Seyfried (HBO's \\"Big Love\\", \\"Mamma Mia\\") is okay, but she spends a maddening amount of time staring into other people's eyes. During her initial confrontation with the wolf, she realizes he has human eyes, so she spends the rest of the film staring into other people's eyes trying to identify the wolf. This and the constant utterances of \\"Are you the wolf?\\" help create a thin, but extremely overwrought tale. It is actually quite a feat to create a story that is both thin and overwrought. Kudos to you and Mr. Reynolds.\\"<br /><br />\\"Are you thornhill?<br /><br />\\"Come with me.\\"<br /><br />\\"The two young men, Seyfried's suitors, are both good looking, but such obvious stand-ins for Robert Pattison and Taylor Lautner it becomes frustrating.The attempts to copy the \\"Twilight\\" formula are blatant and continue throughout. The most frustrating thing?  Shiloh Fernandez and  Max Irons make Pattinson and Lautner look like Laurence Olivier. They are simply two of the worst actors I have seen in some time. At one point, they confront each other on a transom surrounding the village square. This moment is, by no means, unique because they confront each other many times. During this particular confrontation Irons stops Fernandez. Fernandez turns abruptly and says, almost shouting \\"I'm not the wolf\\". He darts his eyes back and forth and repeats the line, this time at barely a whisper. \\"I'm not the wolf.\\"\\"<br /><br />\\"Are you thornhill? Come with me...\\"<br /><br />\\"Catherine, you should stick with small, independent films. These projects allow you to concentrate on the actors and their performances. When you don't have the distractions of a big budget film, this is where your strengths lie. \\"thirteen\\" was really good. Exactly the type of film you should make. But when you took the reigns of \\"Twilight\\" I fear your career was changed for ever. You became the director of a huge hit and I'm not sure you will be able to go back. Or if you even want to. These big budget films are too much for you. The acting in \\"Twilight\\" is okay, but I'm not sure how or what you added to the success of this film. I think my cat could've directed \\"Twilight\\" and it still would have made a gazillion dollars. But because of that success, and the studios eagerness to repeat it, you were brought in to \\"Twilight\\"-ize \\"Red Riding Hood\\". Bravo. \\"Twilight\\"-ize it you did. What this film really needs is the hand of someone like Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam.\\"<br /><br />\\"You must come with me. I promise you an escape.<br /><br />\\"Are you thornhill?\\"<br /><br />\\"And the acting in \\"Riding Hood\\" is universally bad. Or just bland. Julie Christie plays Grandma and a few of her lines brought laughter from the audience when they weren't supposed to. Billy Burke (Bella's dad in \\"Twilight\\") plays Papa. Now that's a stretch. Papa's big scene involves him throwing up in the middle of the town square. Virginia Madsen is Mama and her story seems pulled out of a soap opera with acting to match. Both performances are problematic. Lukas Haas plays the village priest, a scared, cowardly man who eagerly awaits the arrival of his elder, the Reverend Solomon (Oldman). Oldman's performance is the only one with any energy. Usually, I am the first to loathe a film which contains actors using a bunch of fake accents, but \\"Riding Hood\\" is just the opposite problem. The film is set in a fictional village in the 16th Century (?) yet everyone sounds like they are from California.\\"<br /><br />\\"Come with me, thornhill. I promise you this film will be good...\\"<br /><br />\\"You can't make that promise, Catherine. Because \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is a big, hot mess.<br /><br />\\"I AM THORNHILL.

I think my cat could've directed \\"Twilight\\" and it still would have made a gazillion dollars. But because of that success, and the studios eagerness to repeat it, you were brought in to \\"Twilight\\"-ize \\"Red Riding Hood\\". Bravo. \\"Twilight\\"-ize it you did. What this film really needs is the hand of someone like Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam.\\"    \\"You must come with me. I promise you an escape.    \\"Are you thornhill?\\"    \\"And the acting in \\"Riding Hood\\" is universally bad. Or just bland. Julie Christie plays Grandma and a few of her lines brought laughter from the audience when they weren't supposed to. Billy Burke (Bella's dad in \\"Twilight\\") plays Papa. Now that's a stretch. Papa's big scene involves him throwing up in the middle of the town square. Virginia Madsen is Mama and her story seems pulled out of a soap opera with acting to match. Both performances are problematic. Lukas Haas plays the village priest, a scared, cowardly man who eagerly awaits the arrival of his elder, the Reverend Solomon (Oldman). Oldman's performance is the only one with any energy. Usually, I am the first to loathe a film which contains actors using a bunch of fake accents, but \\"Riding Hood\\" is just the opposite problem. The film is set in a fictional village in the 16th Century (?) yet everyone sounds like they are from California.\\"    \\"Come with me, thornhill. I promise you this film will be good...\\"    \\"You can't make that promise, Catherine. Because \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is a big, hot mess.    \\"I AM THORNHILL. And the identity of the werewolf makes no sense.    \\"I am thornhill. And your movie is just bad. It is unlikely it will achieve the success of \\"Twilight\\" or the cult status of other bad films. It is simply bad.    \\"I am THORNHILL...
0312370849|4.0|Sarah, a ten year old girl locked her young brother, Michel, in a cupboard in order to hide him from the French police. Soon after, on July 16, 1942, she and her parents were arrested during the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver roundup. With the complicity of the French State, thousands of Jewish Families were initially held in the Velodrome, and then moved first to internment camps within France and eventually to Auschwitz, in Poland.<br />While detained at the Velodrome, Sarah managed, with the help of a French compassionate policeman, to escape. A farmer hid her. During all this time Sara kept the key of the cupboard and never ceased to think about her little brother. She felt guilty that her brother was languishing and perhaps dying in that confinement. Eventually, she ventured to go back to her parents' apartment, occupied by a new tenant, where she found her little brother's decomposed body.<br /><br />I had been subjected to Nazis' brutality. I experienced and witnessed Nazis' looting, expropriating, deporting, mocking, beating, torturing, shooting, hanging,  babies choked or smashed to death, starving and other unimaginable acts of extreme wickedness carried out against innocent men, women and children. Like Sarah, I had asked what I and my parents have done to deserve to be subjected to so much suffering. I know that Sarah's described tribulations could most definitely have happened. Shockingly, the French Police collaborated with the Germans and most people around were indifferent to the ongoing persecution of their Jewish neighbors.<br /><br />It is very troubling reading how people have no interest in the Holocaust legacy. When Julia asked her husband: \\"Betrand, when you were at school were you taught about the Vel' d'Hiv'?. His answer was \\"No idea\\" It is not something most people want to read about.... Nobody cares anymore. Nobody remembers.\\"<br /><br />The author's note states \\"the characters in Sarah's Key novel are entirely fictitious. But several of the events described are not.\\" The reader wonders which episode is fictitious and which is factual. Sara's life experience as narrated is probable. It should be classified as a memoir or biography. The events enveloping her life contributes to the readers' knowledge about the Holocaust legacy. The minutiae of Julia's life, her marital problems and romances, merits a separate novel. The juxtaposition of these two stories is sometimes distracting. Nevertheless, the book is riveting; it is very well written and expansively researched. Sarah's Key will break your heart finding out how wicked some French had acted during WWII. Reading about Sarah's torment thinking about her brother, tears were streaming down my face. It also warmed my heart reading about some people's kindness and sacrifices to help and save Sarah's life.der wonders which episode is fictitious and which is factual.

B004SS0884|5.0|This album is 100% Britney at her best. There isn't one boring or \\"filler\\" song, I never have to skip a track! I am such a Britney fan, especially after listening to Femme Fatale. I can't wait to see what videos and performances she will do with these hot tracks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Okay. Twenty five words. It's great. We all love it!  From kids to adults in this house. Thank goodness have Rio downloaded on two Androids!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great DVD.  Absolutely can see results within 5 workouts!  It really exhausts you in 20 mins but it's a great workout and you don't feel like you need to supplement with anything else.  I just bought a set of 5lb weights and a mat (if you don't have carpet) and you're good to go!  Love it!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie is billed as the best vampire movie ever....IT IS! Great film, touching story and believable FX. True vampire fans will love this film, the sub-titles don't detract from the impact and acting is spot on.
B004QYZATW|2.0|I can appreciate something about almost any movie but I couldn't find one nice thing to say about this one.  It was just too boring, pointless, and had an implausible, (and dumb) ending.  Oh, I just thought of one good thing... eventually, it ended. I wish I had my time back.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Let me put it this way. I measure distances between cities in terms of how many times I can listen to this album. Nuff sed.
0596805888|4.0|Recently, Nathan Myhrvold of Microsoft fame came out with a 6 volume, 2,400 page series on the science cooking with a list price of $625. I have no intention of purchasing or reading THAT, but after reading Cooking for Geeks, I can't imagine how much more Myhrvold's book could possibly cover.    Potter goes into so many nuances of cooking, that you can geek out on almost any form of cooking. Want to learn about the Mallard effect that causes bacon or bread to brown up nicely? You'll find pages and pages describing it. Want to know why baking in the oven is different than broiling? You can learn that too.    At first, I was expecting more of a cookbook and I was disappointed. But as I read on, I learned the book is much more than a cookbook. It's a wikipedia of cooking: techniques, recipes... the \\"whys\\" behind cooking. Once I got past my trepidation, I had fun geeking out and learned more about what cooking IS, rather than learning this recipe or that recipe. I feel like reading this was along the lines of \\"Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach a man how to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.\\" This book didn't just teach me to cook a meal. It taught me to not be afraid of exploring. It taught me to learn why some ingredients naturally go with other ingredients (and to use that in my cooking). It taught me how to use the tools in my kitchen in order to acheive the results I'd like.
B004SBX112|5.0|So just downloaded this for my epic4g. I figured that it would be a new install and all my passed levels in would have to redo.  Not the case at all. They were still there. It rewrote over the ad version.  Much nicer to play with the ads gone! Thank you Amazon!
0061537969|5.0|This is one of those books that you will want to share and read again.  Enzo has so much to give.  I sent a copy to a friend and gave it to a stranger on a plane. I plan on buying it again. I hope they make a movie. He is so smart and funny wonderful, I can't say it enough. Buy this book.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Excellent re-make of the original Swedish film \\"Let the Right One In\\". The original was billed as the \\"best vampire movie ever\\" and it truly is, this re-make is so well done that it stands to eclipes the original. GREAT movie and VERY well done!
0375507256|1.0|I was constantly aware of the author's self conscious writing while struggling to wade through this book. I kept on hoping it would redeem itself in the second half. While it improved, I feel the various stories do not add up to a whole greater than a sum of its parts - in fact the disjointed nature of this book kept me from caring about or getting involved with the stories or characters. I fail to see why Mitchell structured the book as he did except to try to impress the reader with his literary craft. The stories set in the future took constant work to understand the showy, manipulated language. I was never able to move beyond the artifice of it. Perhaps it requires a British male sense of humor and class consciousness to find the characters of Cavendish and Frobisher more funny than obnoxious, pompous and annoying. There are better ways to reveal the consequences of human greed and cruelty than this book.
0736092269|5.0|Excellent treatment of anatomy and muscle groups. Excellent exercises. Excellent - really excellent - illustrations and labeling. The \\"injury\\" pages and the other color coded pages with detailed, specific, pointed explanations are amazing. I've already changed some of my routine and verified other parts of it. Highly recommended and totally worth the money.
B004J00QLU|5.0|As others have already stated, downgrading an app simply because it has no use to you makes no sense.  Overall, this one seems to perform well compared to the competition.  While I personally am not a fan of task killers, I am able to see the value of this application if configured properly.  A task killer ran manually, with auto start and autokill turned off is perfectly fine, regardless of your android version.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Amazing piece of equipment. So easy to use and get started with.  Many features that I have yet mastered but a brilliantly designed tool.  Would recommend adding this tool to your toolbox.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Few things are as polarizing as Britney Spears music.  It seems to me that regardless of its merits, professional critics tend to give her album the obligatory negative review as if to protect their own credibility.  After all, what kind of organization are you if you give Britney Spears a five-star review?    She may not write much of her own music, but many of American pop culture's most celebrated acts didn't either (Sinatra, the Supremes, and Elvis come to mind).  She also may owe many thanks to her production team, this is nothing new in the music world either (Phil Spector anyone?).  Regardless of who is responsible for the content of this album, it is a great album.    Spears seems to have found the perfect combination of pop accessibility and the trippy, freaky, and dark sound she achieved in \\"Blackout.\\"  Her sound ranges from radio-friendly, to entirely experimental.  \\"How I Roll\\" is a bizarre yet undoubtedly catchy ode to night life.  \\"I Wanna Go\\" hooks listeners from the start with its undeniably infectious beat, making for one of the most exciting dance tracks I've heard in a long time.  While Spears rarely takes time to slow things down, dubstep-inspired \\"Inside Out\\" is a welcome change of pace.  \\"Trouble For Me\\" is a personal favorite of mine, as it seems to be on one hand a throwback to her pop anthems of the \\"Oops\\" era and sounds slightly psychedelic on the other.    I could continue through to evaluate all of the songs, but listeners will formulate their own opinions.  Rest assured that there are no fillers; this is her most cohesive and adventurous album since \\"Blackout.\\"  Her tendency to experiment gives her a leg up on her contemporaries (and if \\"Born This Way\\" is any indication, that includes Lady Gaga... although I still hold out hope that she will live up to her full potential on her upcoming album).    Critics seem to only recognize her accomplishments in retrospect, and I'm sure Femme Fatale will be no different.  Just approach it with an open mind.  Even her biggest detractors may find themselves tapping their feet and humming the tunes.  That is until they realize what they are doing and glance around quickly, afraid that someone is there to accuse them of being the ultimate sellout.
B000M4RG42|2.0|I am interested in this story, and the experiences that these men went through. But this movie did a terrible job of making it interesting. There were very few things to keep me interested and vested in the characters. Letters Of Iwo Jima was so much better. Watch that instead.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is by far the best I've ever had!  Great sound, easy setup!  I have really tried to find fault, but the only thing I would say is that they can break easy, but that's the case with a lot of tech gear.  Also, the software is way over simplified, but that will be a plus for some.  Now, to respond to peoples complaints regarding the noise cancellation of the mic; just go into the software and remove the check from the \\"voice preview\\" setting.  It's set on by default.  Also turn the sidetone setting down as this can contribute to the problem.  I can see why so many users are complaining, but come on...This took me the better part of 30 seconds to figure out after hearing the ambiance in my room while tweaking the software settings.    Being in the I.T. field for 10 years I've seen many crazy complaints, and most of them are user error.  I know that will make a lot of you mad, but it is what it is.  I feel most of the negatives listed on this site are in fact user error, with the exception of a few truly defective units, which is another thing you cannot avoid 100%, it just happens (to me many times).  Out of 100 you may find 3 that are defective no matter what the item.  If you're having issues, and cannot find resolution, ask your kid to help you set them up.    Anyway, these are great headphones, and a welcome addition to my new gaming machine I just built!
0670022411|3.0|I finished the novel yesterday and I'm still torn about it. Part of me thinks a simple-knitted plot like this doesn't deserve more of my time, but there are some brilliant ideas. I really liked the connection between alchemical texts and the Bible, as well as the historical allusions. I enjoyed the descriptions of food, wine, environment. But more than once the heroine really annoyed me. She's prolific in everything -- she's a historian, an athlete, a yogi, she's got a good seat on a horse, and when it comes in handy for the plot, she's a good time-traveler, despite of having been spellbound most of her life. Oh, and lets not forget her preference for spandex. The incoherence made me wonder all the time whether she's just a pretentious whiner or a strong character. Needless to say, I couldn't figure it out, but I ended up not liking her.    I liked Matthew, because of the way he dismounts a horse and his knowledge of the finer, sensual sides of live. The whole control thing didn't bother me that much, because it's so inconsequential. Again, this character is a bit incoherent. And some of the dialogue and the \\"cuddling\\" scenes are better read in a bodice ripper.    Needless to say this marriage will only be consumed in the third volume. It would make sense, but it's so obvious that it's conceived that way to string the reader along, that it's again annoying. Not sure I'm going to wait that long.    So if you want a good read on the beach, it would work. Maybe wait for the paperback.
0525423842|4.0|Storyline -Theodore Boone is the school's lawyer. He helps kids with whatever legal advice they need from foreclosure information to getting their pet back at Animal Court. But when information to the biggest case in town falls into Theo's lap, it's going to take all his law knowledge along with his family's to figure out what to do next.    Positive - Theo is a good kid and supports his friends in trouble. He never turns away a \\"client\\" and keeps his word. When things get over his head, he asks his family for help.    Negative - The story took a while to get started and the ending could have used some work. There was also a lot of lawyer talk which might disinterest young adults and Theo could have behaved a little less like a lawyer and a little more like a kid at times.    Finish - The only complaint I had with this book was how it ended and how long it took for some exciting this to happen. It was a good book though and the issues I had with it can be forgiven if the book becomes a series (but I don't know if that will happen). But any kid who wants to be a lawyer or is interested in the law would probably like this book.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|I've been an Avril fan from the start and I really love this Cd!! Hope there will be Cd's to come!!
B003XU75QG|5.0|I was blown away by how good this CD is. Taylor Momsen is a bit of a hot mess in reality but the girl can SING! And she wrote all the songs on the album. Between the ballads and edgy, rock songs I'm absolutely loving this band. I've been listening to it for weeks now and I'm still not sick of it! Only complaint, why is \\"Zombie\\", one of her best songs, not on this US version? :(
078401213X|3.0|The story was good, but it was really hard to follow. I sometimes felt lost while watching this movie. The acting was really good, which is a plus. Whatever film this was shot on really made it difficult to watch. The grainy grey gave me a headache. I am a fan of his films, so it didn't bother me as much.
1416550550|5.0|This was a totally captivating book!  The author catches you up in the whole story line and you begin to feel as though you are part of the family (the good, bad and ugly).  I couldn't put it down!
B004G6009K|5.0|The previews for this movie didn't interest me at all, but when we wanted to take our kids to a movie one night, this was just rated so well that we decided to give it a try.  It was so wonderful!  My boys 8 and 6 even loved it, due to the funny parts with the horse and the male character, Flynn, in the movie.  My 4 year old daughter loved it, of course, as well.  And my husband, of whom doesn't get into Disney movies really at all, also thought that it was a great movie as well.  Rapunzel is a sweet character that is kind and a good addition to the Disney princesses.  We bought this movie the day it came out, because we were quite excited about it.
B004CEUEWE|2.0|Was hoping I'd at least be entertained.  Ben Afleck really isn't a good actor.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting.  I think that says it all.  Didn't even finish  watching it.
0880796863|5.0|By today's standards the imagery and color of the cards are of a \\"lesser\\" quality, but these cards aren't supposed to measure up to today's standards. They are as close to an exact copy of a hundred year old deck as we could hope to have readily available. As a history buff I love being able to have in my hands the same images used a century ago with no modification. It is the same thing as a scan of an original comic book versus a computer representation of the art work in the same book. The closer to the original the better it can be understood and appreciated.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|By far her best work! LOVEEEEEEE this CD and the 4 bonus tracks are incredible too. Just makes you wanna dance, work out, party!
B00028HBKM|3.0|I think everyone should see this movie at least once. Then never again. There is this cool book, the Bible, tells the whole story without all the blood and tears. I saw this movie with a group of my friends and we were all crying by the end. Even the ones who aren't religious. It is a very powerful movie. But not a movie I would want to see over and over again. Not only because there is not a lot of replay value, but also because of the sheer violence.
B00001OH7U|5.0|As a Bowie fan, it's hard to seperate this album from the other classics.  The first time I heard this album I didn't like it as I was yearning for the Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane/Diamond Dogs artist I had come to know.  This was certainly a transitional album that relied more heavily on synthesizers and other eletctronic instruments that were to become a staple of his music during the later 70's and 80's.<br /><br />Like the first taste of something new, my musical palate was a little put off by this album.  However, after several spins on the turntable (at the time) this became one of my favorite Bowie albums.  If you want to really appreciate this ablum, turn off the lights, put on some headphones and let yourself be enveloped by the music, especially the title track \\"Station to Station\\".  It's like a roller coaster ride, with a slow build up and a fantastic finish.  It's comparable to Zepplin's Stairway to Heaven in the way it builds and finishes.  But, this album has so many other tasty morsels.  TVC-15 pulls you in just like the song describes. It's a foot taping rocker that has a layer of complexity to it.  I'm not a big fan of \\"Golden Years\\" because it sounds too POP for my tastes, but that's just me.  Musically, it's a great song with a fine arrangement.  On the other side of the spectrum is \\"Word on a Wing\\" which is Bowie's vague, but revealing, musings on his relationship to God, I think.  It's a beautiful song and perhaps one of Bowie's best ballads.  Very much underappreciated.<br /><br />If you're new to David Bowie, this album is essential to understand the transition from Ziggy Stardust to an absolutely different artist.  If you're already a Bowie fan, I think this album is a must have to understand the musical complexity and genius of his art.  Although this album isn't the classic of \\"Spiders from Mars\\" it's certainly in the same league for Bowie fans.
B00012FXB8|4.0|Aliens was a huge hit in 1986 & did well on when on all the home video formats at the time. So around 1987 & 88 there was talk of a sequel of course. William Gibson wrote a script. Now James Cameron couldn't return cause he was busy with The Abyss & T2. David Giler tried to get Ridley Scott he declined well then they got Renny Harlin who directed Prison & Nightmare On Elm Street 4 on the documentry David Giler said that the Gibson script wasn't interesting I was like WTF!? Joe Roth who ran Fox at the time said it was too gorey it was too over the top & it couldn't pass for an R raiting. The Gibson script is Ripley, Hicks, Newt & Bishop crash on a Socalist Colony or something like that. Ripley would be in a coma & it would deal with this virus that turns people into Aliens it would've had an element of John Carpenter The Thing it would've had transformation effects on par with The Thing & The Fly. There was going to be 8 or 9 Marine vs Alien battles 2 or 3 Queen Aliens kind of like The Alien Trilogy game. Newt was going to be sent to Earth to get her away from the fighting as was Ripley. The ending was going to tie into Alien 4 with them going to The Alien Planet & Ripley would return. But the brass said it really wasn't interesting. Honestly by the time they had went & spent all that money you could've made The Gibson script. In fact Renny Harlin wanted to do a film on The Alien Planet. Or do a movie on Earth Fox made a teaser trailer that lied about it being on Earth. Another script came in 89by David Towhy which was rejected it isn't that great what I remember is on a Mining Colony some eggs were found & The Weyland Yutani uses prisoners for there experments they genetically enhance Facehugger's & we'd get these muscled up huge Aliens with spikes nobody from Aliens returned in this script. Also this smae year Eric Red wrote a script he also wrote the original Hitcher. This script I have read it is AVP bad basically The Sulaco crash lands on a Bio Dome not with Pauly Shore not it is a Bio Dome of a small town Everyone from Aliens is dead including Ripley. The Company does expermenting where there would've been differeent types of Aliens Dog Aliens which would be in A3 but Cats Chickens Cows Sheep Horses Mosquitos Bees Bats It was pretty bad. Renny said f v   c k  this & he went to direct Die Hard 2. By 1990 Fox hired Vincent Ward he wrote a script a lot of people like The Wooden Planet scrip. Fox actually approved of it this was the decline of 20th Century FOXm to what they have became today. Really how do you get a wooden planet how does it exist did somebody build it & shoot it up into space. This script had Newt & Hicks killed I think it was suppose to include a new Alien called The King Alien. Ripley did have an Alien in her it was Monks instead of Prisoners. Basically 1 of The Monks give Ripley this drink she coughs up The Alien The Monk preforms CPR it goes into The Monk & Ripley escapes & this point FOX wanted Sigourney Weaver back she agreed to it only if they killed her character off. They kept changing stuff Vincent Ward left or was fired when he couldn't do his Wooden Planet Alien movie. This is where the trouble begain.  So they brought in David Fincher who directed a lot of big music videos around this time. They changed it to a Prison Planet Fury 161. For those who blame David Fincher  your wrong he tried his best to work with a script that was being written & rewritten  during filming FOX was strict constant reshoots. Plus it was more FOX & Sigourney Weaver's fault FOX didn't know what they were doing & Sigourney Weaver didn't fight for Hicks & Newt to return. Sigourney Weaver reprised her role. Also stars Charles S Dutton as Dillon, Charles Dance as Dr Clemens, Ralph Brown as Aarron or 85. Paul McGann as Golic, Lance Henriksen as Bishop & Brian Glover as Superintendant Andrews. Story is sometime after Aliens we open up to a Facehugger on board The Sulaco a fire happens they are let out by The EEV it lands on FURY 161 a prison colony also in a deleted scene in the special edition Clemens a Doctor finds Ripley on The Beach covered in waste & bugs she's still alive Hicks is dead he was impaled Newt drowned Bishop is smashed beyond repair. Ripley later wakes up & her & Clemens have a relationship going on. Ripley is concerned about Newt when she checks out the EEV she wants the body checked I know people don't like this scene I can understand that but it doesnt't show much. In the theatrical cut the Alien comes out of a Dog in the special edition it comes out of an Ox. Also 2 prisoners bring in the dead Ox & they talk about what they would like to do to Ripley. During The Funeral scene you get this great speech by Dillon who is a great character in this movie he has some of the best lines of the serie I think. During this scene we get The Ox or Dog burster. It was really well shot. Also the sub plot with Golic was added where the newer faster runner Alien kills some prisoners Golic was found in the lunch room all bloody & eating dinner he keeps talking about The Dragon did it. Ripley does suspect there is an Alien around when a prisoner suspicously dies. Ripley goes to find Bishop & we get this stupid r   @  p  e scene which I could've done without. Ripley asks if there was an Alien on board Bishop tells her it was with us all the way. Which don't get me wrong I like this movie but they have never explained how the egg got on The Sulaco cause The Alien Queen's egg   s  a c  k was ripped off. Another thing is I just can't root for the prisoners like I did The Marines. Also added back in Andrews chews Clemens out. Oh if you like Clemens he dies which he was 1 of the good characters in this movie he redeemed himself a person & he just killed off. We get added dialoge by Dillon in the special edition before Andrews speaks. Ripley goes into the room to warn them but Andrews is grabbed by The Alien 1 of the prisoners reaction is \\" F v  c   k!\\" There aren't any weapons on Fury 161only carving knives & fire axes. Granted I like firearms better but no weapons I was cool with. Another thing added back in was Ripley, Dillon & the other prisoners actually trap The Alien Ripley & Aarron contact the company to get permission to kill it. She finds out what she suspect for a long time The Weyland Yutani want an Alien to study for weapon research. The Weyland Yutani are coming to Fury 161 she is top priority. Golic tricks of the prisoners to let him go he knocks him out. Then he lets the Alien out. Ripley finds out she has an Alien in her & it's a Queen she wants Dillon to kill her he doesn't I'll do when we get kill The Alien. Dillon gets a awesome line \\" Do you want it on your feet? Or on your knees begging? I ain't much for begging! Nobody ever gave me nothing! So I say f v c   k that thing & we fight it!\\" Aarron thinks Ripley is crazy. Then we get a fairly climatic scene with Ripley saying \\" Kill me kill me I think the studio didn't want Fincher to film that he filmed it anyway. Also I think they didn't want the part where she says \\" You've been my life so long that I don't remember anything else.\\" They try to get The Alien to the lead works. Then they go & kill Dillon unfortantly. Ripley & 1 of The Prisoners dump the toxic lead on The Alien then turn on the sprinklers The Alien blows apart then Bishop from the company shows up Aarron turns against them he hits Bishop with a wrench which he is human not an android. Ripley goes & sacrifces herself so the company doesn't get the Alien. I like the scene in the theatrical version in the special edition the hot lead looks so fake. This movie did have a very troubled production John Landau & company continally interfered this same company was strict on Fincher but gave The Brother Strause full reign. Why did they hire him just to be strict on him again this was the decline of 20th Century FOX today there 20th century FUX. On the documenry David Fincher says it best \\" It's amazing that 20th century FOX is the number 1 studio in the US cause there all such a bunch of morons.\\" It does a flaws like killing off Hicks & Newt they should've handled that better like the prisoner I didn't care for. Charles S Dutton & Charles Dance should've lived. I don't know what was up with the effects for the Alien up close with the guy in the suit it looks fine far away shots it looks like early PS1 graphics. Another thing is it's like FOX was just pushing Fincher to meet a release date they should've left him alone. This movie didn't do too well in The US but did better overseas. A lot of people hated that it went back to 1 Alien but that's not what made Aliens work. Aliens had heart great character & awesome dialoge. Plus there is a Alien Resurrection an Alien vs Predator & AVPR. Those all have lots of Aliens & most of those suck except for Resurrection maybe? Fincher would go on to do some better movies. Sigourney Weaver did a great job again. Charles Dance was very good for the time he was given. Paul McGann was ok. Lance Henricksen was good for what he had to do. Charles S Dutton I liked him a lot in this movie. This had my favorite score of all 4 films. This is my 2nd favorite movie of the series. Next 20th century FOX decides to clone Ripley for a forced sequel.
B004G6009K|5.0|...and now I've finally found it. I don't usually write short one note reviews like this but there are enough reviews on the story and film itself. I just have to say that I was simply amazed at the beautiful quality of this film on blu-ray. You can truly see the light, the darks and everything in between.    It might be the most fantastic looking of all my blu-ray titles, and I own quite a few. If you are one of the people who have not yet stepped up to blu-ray I highly suggest this in high definition, it comes with the DVD too and will be well worth it in the long run.    It just look gorgeous, one of the first films I've bought that looks as good or better at home than it did in the theater. I'm happy to own this Disney computer animated fairy tale, it might be their most beautifully animated film yet and hopefully they find a way to present more fairy tales this way. Now on to the next dream...    Thanks    P.S. I do wish there had been more special features, a director's commentary would have been nice or a longer making of documentary than twelve minutes, luckily I can at least watch this enchanting film over and over, it's that resplendent, dazzling, exquisite whatever word you want to use.
B004SBX112|5.0|Just like the original Angry Birds, but with seasonal themes that are just as fun.  For those looking to download and don't want to lose save of the ad version don't worry.  This will basically install on top of the old app and let you keep all your saved data, but now you have no ads!!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|listened to on car, in headphones, on good speakers, this is amazing. i won't be seeing it live though, until she stops wearing stilettos when she's supposed to be dancing. look at all the great past britney videos, she's wearing flats.
B004SBX112|5.0|This game is great! I had been playing the free version with the annoying ads, but with this being the free app of the day it's an instant download! And to those who rate one star saying it's free in the android market, there's two versions geniuses.

B004DSX5B6|5.0|I was scared of getting this multitool due to the problems that the \\"Ultimate knife\\" from Gerber and Bear Grylls had when first released, but after taking the multitool camping at the beach and using it around the house for a while I can say that the tool is great. I finally gave my old Swiss army knife a deserved rest.
B004289ZW0|5.0|I purchased to use in my airplane, as a GPS for iPad apps that provide aviation maps and charts.  This product is excellent for geo-referencing an airplanes position on moving maps, therefore enhancing situational awareness.  It works.  My flights are under 3 1/2 hours and the battery was still strong.  The bluetooth feature is handy, so the GPS receiver can be placed in any convenient location that receives a satellite signal, and the iPad can be placed in a convenient location for the pilot...with no wires to get in the way.
0895260131|5.0|Spencer is certainly an active researcher and presenter of his research into Islam.  He seeks in this work to expose many of the myths a politically correct society propagates.<br /><br />Namely, he deals with these:  Who is Muhammed, really and do his followers emulate him?  Does the Qur'an teach jihad on the infidels? Was the expansion of Islam from 7th to 11th centuries brutal?  Were the Crusades acts of unprovoked aggression?  How does all this relate to the current talk of Islamic radicalism?<br /><br />What I find truly attractive about this series is the presentation of other views which are not normally heard on the majority of American elitism, and especially the featured \\"A Book You're Not Supposed to Read.\\"
B001U887PQ|3.0|Comfortable, yes. Lightweight, yes. ---but they are wide and make my feet look huge! They run very wide--too wide and make you look like you have Goofy or Pluto feet. (Seriously! Check out Disney character feet--same look!)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it is a whole lot better than the first one, less levels though! and the new bird is off the hook. i had it for two days and im already done
B00005JKGK|5.0|I saw this movie when I was in high school and although I never understood what it was that was stirring inside me, over the years I kept trying to watch the film.  As I have gotten older and immigrated from Asia to the US, my life was turned upside down from the changes and the new culture I was placed in the midst of. It took a while for me to find my place in my new life, and land with my feet planted on the ground. But the stories of these women I finally understood because it was mine too.    Amy Tan has represented the strengths, weaknesses, and struggles of many Asian women in such a clear and bold way.  How traditions, cultures, and environment play such a vital role in our lives that shape what we think and who we become. I am so thankful she wrote this book and thankful that they made a film of it.
0446691437|3.0|I had high hopes for this book based on the reviews.  I was disappointed.  The first part was about resistance and what it is.  I thought that section could have been cut down to a few pages as it just seemed to be the same thing reiterated.  The second part was about... I don't know, it was forgettable.  The third part was the most useful but concentrated too much on angels and a higher power, very little on overcoming resistance.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have used these programs on my old Palm Treo and now my Nexus One.   So far,  it has been able to open correctly everything I have tried,  including clad files.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Plenty fun, no problems with game.   Love and am looking forward to more releases.  Had no problem downloading it for android.  The only thing that sucks about leaving a review is it has to be at least twenty five words long.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Eight songs are really not enough! You hear me Radiohead! It's more like an EP really. But hey, a few songs by Radiohead is better than a lot of songs from any mainstream artist today. The standouts: \\"Lotus Flower,\\" everyone and their mother has seen the flamboyant music video but the song is already one of my all-time favorites from the band. \\"Codex\\" is Pyramid Song Part Deux and simply beautiful. \\"Little By Little\\" is another favorite.
B003ITDN86|4.0|This is Sum 41's (Deryck Whibley's) first self produced album and I'll have to say I disagree with the negative reviews on this album.  I enjoy it.  And if you're any sort of a Sum 41 fan you'll find something to like about this album too.  I wouldn't say this album is \\"darker\\" as Whibley has stated in his interviews so much as it seems to take you into his side of the breakup with Avril Lavigne... which is fine; inspiration comes in all shapes and forms.  And flying, raw emotions tend to lean toward better music imho.    I find this album as a whole is an... almost.  I had the first track (Reason to Believe) cranked up and was really getting into it, and as soon as I fell in love with the song, it crapped out into pop and then piano.  The song isn't bad, I just love the angry, loud stuff (you know... when Linkin Park was actually good and Smashing Pumpkins were more than just Billy) and Reason to Believe was almost epic.  I love Track 2 (Screaming Bloody Murder).... it's on the radio... 'nuff said.  What Am I To Say (Track 6) is your typical slower song from Sum 41 like \\"With Me\\" or \\"Best of Me\\" from Underclass Hero or \\"Some Say\\" from Chuck.  Sick of Everyone (Track 8) is your typical loud song from the band (think \\"No Reason\\" from Chuck).  Blood In My Eyes (Track 11) is my favorite (think \\"We're All To Blame\\" from Chuck).  The rest of the album is just kinda -- meh.    Being a fan who really only enjoyed Chuck, in general, if you're a Sum 41 fan to any degree, there's something here for everyone.
B004SQS9FA|1.0|\\"Give Up The Ghost\\"    SHOULD have been the album title...    ...and what Radioheads agent and label should be advising them to do.    \\"The King Of Limbs\\" is, quite frankly, beyond pretentious.    I wish more people held groups like this to a higher standard of \\"music\\"     and quit making lame excuses for them, speaking about \\"sonic textures\\"     and \\"mystical weaving of pure rapture\\".    Just call it what is really is:    an abysmal (musical???) mess.    Yes, the emperor has no clothes.    There. I said it.
B004GYY714|1.0|On my Nexus One using Miracle r21 and r26,  thus has been a very reliable app.   I mainly stream talk,  and the results are top notch.   A setting to keep the application streaming when BT goes out of range,  or resume when wifi goes in and out of range would be nice.   Now I have to restart the playback or the application manually.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Tried this because it was free and very disappointed. Much slower to ID a song then SongHound. Uninstalling, rather deal with ads in SoundHound. HTC EVO 4G.
B000286RKW|5.0|item was priced well, shipped fast in  extremely save and protected manor, When the time arises again if I need something else from this shipper I will go back to them.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|This album is a lighter version of her \\"Blackout\\" album, but in no way is the production similar!  With producers like Max Martin (worked with Britney since \\"Baby One More Time\\") and Dr. Luke, to name a few, the album is just popping into your body, so its a fun album to dance too! All the songs, especially Drop Dead Beautiful, and Seal it with a Kiss, Hold It Against Me, and I wanna go show the Femme Fatale that is Godney Spears!    Seriously all the songs are f-in awesome. Buy it and see it for yourself.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|This is my favorite Avril Lavigne CD since her debut \\"Let Go\\" . The first 7 songs are good.  \\"What the Hell\\" is a highlight - and unfortunately nothing else comes close to that bratty fun. But there are other good songs.  \\"Push\\" is both humorous and real....I like to hear her say \\"just shut up\\" over and over again...it's a unique pop song...fun on my headphones. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" - the hypnotic swirl of - \\"all those crazy things we did, didn't think about it just went with it\\"...and the fuzzy warmth of \\"I wish you were here\\", \\"Smile\\" - Avril pop orgasm, \\"Stop Standing There\\"- catchy chorus with retro hand claps, \\"I Love You\\" - sweet verse that bursts into sugary chorus of many Avril's harmonizing with herself...all good.  Though the CD is reflective of her divorce, it's not maudlin.  Her voice has a purity and amazing range - both  angel and  banshee. I'm not crazy about \\"Everybody Hurts\\"...the melody is not catchy, the lyrics are not deep and it doesn't play to her vocal strengths. \\"Not Enough\\", is a bit whiney and doesn't have the hooks that the first set of songs had, but the lyrics are thoughtful and true and it shows her vocal range well - probably very heartfelt, \\"4 Real\\" reminds me of her \\"Let Go\\" debut - nice energy - tomboy Avril and sweet Avril. The worst song on the CD is \\"Alice\\"...it sounds like nails on a chalkboard, thankfully it's at the end so I can just turn it off. I like this CD - listen to it 3 times before you decide...I didn't like it the first time I heard it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works great,  and really shows where I have dead spots,  or fluctuating reception.   When away from home,  it helps me pick the strongest hot spot easily.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The Defaced Editions of the Original Trilogy are an insult to every artist whose work was destroyed and lost to the world by Lucas' actions. Not going to touch this with a thousand foot lightsaber. To give the fans the respect they deserve for making this franchise as big as it is, and to do right by all the people that worked hard made these films great against all odds, Lucas should do the right thing and sell (for massive profit!) a proper bluray transfer of the REAL films, and I don't mean as a half-assed special feature on the 2nd disk either.
1439153663|5.0|At first I had trouble keeping track of all the characters, but I was so intrigued that I stuck with it, and I am soooo glad.  I just loved it.  Having recently read The Help and Mudbound I found it a great combination of the two.
B0032JTV74|5.0|Great fun!!! Love the \\"jukebox\\" feature that will play just the songs on each disc. It's over the top scripted and off the wall funny.
B004NSULHM|5.0|In 2007, Radiohead shocked the world by announcing the release of \\"In Rainbows\\" via their website just days before fans could purchase the record for a price to be determined by each individual consumer.<br /><br />Sure, the majority of listeners opted for a free download, but plenty of people chose to give something back to the band for their music. That album eventually became my personal pick for the greatest record of the decade, partially because of the means in which it was released, so Radiohead's next studio effort was easily my most anticipated album of this year.<br /><br />On Valentine's Day, in a similar fashion to \\"In Rainbows,\\" Radiohead released a statement on their website that their new album, \\"The Kind of Limbs,\\" would be released digitally on Saturday, Feb. 19 with a preorder available for the \\"newspaper album\\" version that includes both the vinyl and CD versions along with \\"many large sheets of artwork, 625 tiny pieces of artwork and a full-color piece of oxo-degradeable plastic to hold it all together.\\"<br /><br />As exciting as this announcement was, fans were given an additional surprise when the album was made available on Friday, one day early.<br /><br />At just over 37 minutes in length, \\"The King of Limbs\\" is Radiohead's shortest studio recording to date; five minutes shorter than their debut record, \\"Pablo Honey.\\" Opening with \\"Bloom,\\" Radiohead brings back memories of \\"Kid A\\" thanks to irregular beats accompanied by piano, synthesizer and bass parts submersed in echo effects. As Thom Yorke's distinctive, haunting vocals slice through the mix, it's easy to see why those new to Radiohead might have trouble enjoying the recording. The melody offered by Yorke's voice does little to incorporate itself with the backing track, but this is nothing new as far as the band is concerned. As if consoling new listeners, Yorke offers the lyric \\"don't blow your mind with why\\" halfway through \\"Bloom.\\"<br /><br />What makes Radiohead so unique is that they have prepared their fans for this kind of listening experience. \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"The Bends\\" were relatively straightforward rock records with songs that are all quite easy to enjoy right off the bat. However, once \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\" were released, it became clear that Radiohead intended to be something much more than just a standard, run of the mill rock band.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Idioteque\\" exercised the ears, pulling listeners into uncharted territory, while still offering enough familiarity to keep the process enjoyable. Eventually, Radiohead had earned the highest honor fans can bestow upon a band, patience. Radiohead's music became an art form that often requires multiple, intent listens to truly digest and thanks to their methodical introduction to their own music, Radiohead's fans are always more than willing to take the time.<br /><br />Although \\"Bloom\\" completely fades out at the end, the rhythm of \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" picks up right where \\"Bloom\\" left off; maintaining an almost identical tempo, but utilizing a different instrumentation. Thanks to a slightly more standard verse-chorus layout, \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" is the most radio-ready track on the first half of the record, but the most imaginative aspect of the song, the final 30 seconds, will most likely be edited out before becoming radio waves.<br /><br />Those final 30 seconds symbolically cut all the instruments as Thom Yorke sings \\"took my melody\\" before the track becomes feedback, static, and birds chirping in the distance.<br /><br />\\"Little By Little\\" follows \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" with similar off-kilter rhythms, but this time utilizes instruments in the background to seemingly throw the listener off their guard. A guitar strumming along off-beat or spliced and reversed tracks in the distance feel out of place at first, but become an expected aspect of the song on future listens. They also serve as preparation for things to come when \\"Feral\\" closes out the first half of the record with an eccentric instrumental that heavily manipulates Yorke's indiscernible vocals into a synthetic instrument; offering hints of melodies that are never quite finished.<br /><br />The second half of the record could almost be considered a separate work in and of itself, but simple things like the static and bird chirps heard in both \\"Codex\\" and \\"Give up the Ghost\\" tie the two halves together. \\"Lotus Flower,\\" the first single off of \\"The King of Limbs,\\" begins a string of more melodic, lyrical and subdued tracks. With words relating to getting lost in music and a video that shares the same theme, \\"Lotus Flower\\" describes Radiohead's ideal listener.<br /><br />The following two tracks, \\"Codex\\" and \\"Give up the Ghost\\" are easily the mellowest of the album. The repeating piano chords of \\"Codex\\" will remind many fans of \\"Sail to the Moon\\" and \\"Pyramid Song\\" while the introduction of brass and later strings gives the track a surreal beauty that stands with the best of their calmer songs.<br /><br />\\"The King of Limbs\\" closes with Separator, a track many believe hints at second part to come later thanks to the repeated line \\"if you think this is over, then you're wrong.\\" Is Radiohead using this release as a way to prepare fans for something bigger? Perhaps, but you could say the same of nearly every single one of their studio releases to date.<br /><br />\\"The King of Limbs\\" is indeed a listening experience. Avert your attention for a second and you might just miss a key element or effect. As a whole, it might not be as memorable as \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"Kid A,\\" but like all of their albums since, it is truly unique and absolutely worth repeated listens.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Codex\\"lates Yorke's indiscernible vocals into a synthetic instrument; offering hints of melodies that are never quite finished.

B003L20ICE|2.0|Given the great reviews and honors I expected something special.  But there wasn't a moment I wasn't aware of a script being acted out, actors being minutely directed (not one actor at any time looked relaxed or spontaneous), and some sort of social agenda going on, though for the life of me I still can't figure what that agenda was.  I found the father being cast out as the Devil and the mother who strayed being all sunshine, light and goodness treated as an angel at the end illogical and a false note. But, then, the whole film kept striking false notes for me.  I guess one problem is I've known so many gay people with kids and in my experience nothing unusual or conflicting goes on in their lives that doesn't go on in anyone's lives.  And none of their lives would make a movie, that's for sure.  Adrift in the Heartland
B004SBX112|5.0|Nice to see an ad free version of Angry Birds Seasons. Runs smooth on my Motorola Droid. A must have! Thanks Amazon AppStore for the free great game.
B004NSULHM|2.0|this cd is hard to listen to for me cause i love half the songs, hate the other half.  bloom, lotus flower, codex, and separator are awesome songs.    bloom - love how they use the piano sample through the whole song, the record skipping and the horns/orchestra at the end is awesome.  it is one of those classic radiohead songs that gives you something solid at the beginning, something sorta \\"out there\\" in the middle, but then comes back at the end with a mash up of everything you just heard and comes together awesomely.     lotus flower - the DRUMS and BASS on this song are amazing. just all over the place and unexpected, but sounds so good. it's so DIFFICULT to make sounds like this actually sound good together.  that's one thing people don't get about radiohead's bleeps and blips.  they make it sound RANDOM and GOOD at the same time.      codex-  idon't really need a reason to like this song.    separator - i totally admit there is nothing special about this song like some of their other songs that you'd say \\"only radiohead could have made this\\".  it's just a sweet song, great ending for the cd. love how the guitar comes in during the middle, really gets me.    songs i cannot stand.    mr magpie - not sure how anyone likes this song. it's so weak. and sometimes with radiohead, if i hear a song i think is a little weak, i listen to it a few times cuz i know i'm missing something. something in there that i just don't get. but nah, not here. nothing they do technically is impressive.  the background 'noises' don't really go together. this song is probably why people call this cd a collection of B-sides because this definitely sounds like some of their b-sides... and it sounds like some of their b-sides that i skip on my 'radiohead b-side' playlist.  it's just so repetitive and boring.    little by little - i cannot understand how anyone can listen to this and think it's good.  it's a mess. i think this song in particular is an experiment by them to see how many of their fans just love anything and everything they put out.  the background drum loop is so weak, it's like they stole it from some loop program.  god i hate this song.    feral - this is a 3:17 track of the band (or maybe one of their mixers) just playing with a sampler.  the 1st minute is more or less one loop played over and over with them moving the volume up and down on the sample of thom's voice.  anyone who calls this beautiful or thinks it has some kind of meaning to it is just out of their mind.  it really isn't too annoying because it goes by fast and the sounds are cool. but this is not a SONG, it's a long interlude.      give up the ghost - god i hate this song worse than little by little. just a terrible, annoying, way too long song of loops that shouldn't be looped.      so i give this cd 2 stars.  not 2.5, but 2.    i could either round up or round down.    reasons to round up-  some of these tracks really have some awesome sounds and effects. definitely jealous of how they put it together and their mixing techniques. very cool how they mix their live instruments in with the electronics.  they definitely do a great job on that aspect, even the songs i hate.    also, it is a lot like eraser, (and i like eraser) except it's a lot deeper in terms of musicality.  eraser had a lot of loops, like this, but the loops here are more intricate and better planned.     reasons to round down-  only 8 tracks  4 songs i like can't get more than 2 stars  the songs i don't like, i REALLY don't like them  i don't see me playing this a lot after the next radiohead cd is released.    i have a lot of other thoughts on this cd but you're probably bored by now.    thanks for reading.

1439190275|2.0|It's good to see that new authors have basically called on Atkins fans to disregard and abandon the original Atkins diet which advocated a high fat diet of meat and dairy. Meat and dairy consumption has been tied to multiple deadly diseases like heart disease, diabetes II, cancer and high blood pressure. Mass produced meat is full of contaminants like antibiotics, mercury and pesticides. Recall that Dr. Atkins died with heart disease and was overweight by many accounts.    A more balanced diet advocated here is a welcome rebuke of Atkins I which probably endangered more people's health than any book written in the last decade. I like the parts about vegetable and grain protein. Meat and dairy consumption is dangerous but people can read and decide for themselves.[[ASIN:B0042JSNWC Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease]]

B004MC8CA2|1.0|This is a great app. A huge variety of English translations as well as a large amount of international translations. All for free. All on your phone. Some translations are only available from the cloud and others can be downloaded and stored on your phone. That is great for flights, riding the subway and any other situation where you might not have 3g coverage. It is also regularly updated to provide additional great features. AND IT'S ALL FREE! This is an app you won't regret having.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Incredible movie. I've viewed it a couple times subbed previously, but with Evangelion I much prefer the dub... viewing 2.22 this time around felt like an entirely new experience!    The only fault I can find with this release is the packaging. I much prefered the packaging of the US release of 1.11, wish they would've kept with that style. That said, the new style isn't bad, but the actual quality of the packaging is a little on the cheap side.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What a great upgrade over previous Angry Bird games, highly recommended, nd can you beat the price? The graphics and smoothness are a whole new level.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is simple, and small in size, because it doesn't actually do much on its own. What it does do, however, is connect you to the Wolfram Alpha analytical engine which is absolutely amazing insofar as what it can accomplish in math and many other areas (as mentioned by other reviewers). If you're not sure about paying for the app, go check out the web version and test drive the Wolfram Engine yourself before buying the mobile app. Google: Wolfram Alpha.
B004SBX112|5.0|it is free because there are no ads. people really make me wonder. the one with ads is so freaking slow sometimes! think before you post a review people. this is an awesome deal i hate the ads so much.
0811826848|5.0|Es un excelente libro, mejor de lo que imaginaba. Buen material fotográfico, interesante propuesta de diseño página a página y, por sobre todo, un valioso material para conocer más detalles de la historia de los Beatles contados por ellos mismos; porque la gracia del libro, además del elemento gráfico, es que agrega nueva información e historias a lo que ya habíamos conocido gracias al documental Anthology. Realmente, creo que es un documento indispensable en toda biblioteca de un beatlemaniaco.  Saludos!
B002VECM72|5.0|The Blind Side is about so much more than just football! That's the best part.<br /><br />The Blind Side tells the mostly accurate story of NFL player Micheal Orr. Micheal grew up in the social services system. He was in and out of foster homes. He lived on the streets. He crashed on his friends' couchs. He survived. Orr had limited contact with his drug addicted mother and his many half-siblings and because of his unstable home life he was left with a poor education.<br /><br />But his life changed when he met the Touhys. Through a series of events, the Touhys end up taking Micheal Orr in and adopting him. They make sure that so much more than his basic needs are met. They hire a tutor to help him catch up in school and to remain eligible for football (for which Micheal had a natural but undiscovered gift). Needless to say, his life was changed forever.<br /><br />The movie is heartfelt and hilarious. I absolutely love Sandra Bullock who plays the spunky, straight forward Mrs. Tuohy (Mom)! You will laugh and most likely cry. It's just an amazing story and an amazing movie.
0060574216|5.0|This is a helpful book for both men and women on recognizing key differences in the ways that men and women operate and perceive things, and therefore interpret. Men try to understand women through the perspective of a man and women try to understand men through the perspective of a woman, neither produces the right results, and this book does a decent job of highlighting the discrepancies. Some of the coaching is lacking a bit in the author's understanding of what makes both men and women tick, but overall there is a lot to be learned, if nothing else, genuine awareness of the differences, not just clich&eacute;s, \\"like men are logical, women are emotional\\". The framework of the book, relating Male and Females as from different planets with inherently different societal objectives and protocols, is a great way to illustrate the profound differences. And a key lesson the author presents is to embrace and enjoy the knowledge of the differences, instead of living life frustrated by and fighting based upon mis-understanding each other.<br /><br />If your're struggling with your relationships or understanding the opposite sex, this is not a bod book to read. IMHO a better book is \\"The Man's Guide to Great Relationships and Marriage\\" by David Cunningham.

0756404738|3.0|I am wearing a Kingkiller Chronicle t-shirt as I write this. Don't question my devotion to this series. That said...    Book 2 was a disappointment. Everything amazing about book 1 digressed into very traditional, almost poor fantasy writing. Book 1 travelled at Blitzkrieg pace, making it engaging and exciting and compelling. Book 2 draaagged with Denna, with the Adem, with the Maer, and with the stupid bandit chase. I wish I could remove those 400-500 pages. When Kote got to a potentially interesting story--learning Tempi in a day--he skipped over it. And then continued to the dullest part of the novel.     I still have hope for Book 3. There is so much that the second installment didn't answer that it MUST move at a quicker pace...
B004L3AQFG|4.0|28-year old Aron Ralston was an experienced hiker and climber who set out for a day of fun in Canyonlands that changed his life forever.  He fell down a crevice, a boulder pinned his arm, and he was unable to free himself.  Over the next five days, Aron recorded his thoughts on his video camera and dreamed about his family and friends, then, with no food or water left, decided to end his ordeal.<br /><br />This movie is filmed almost like a documentary, a virtual one-man show for James Franco.  He's very good and believable as the hot shot outdoorsman who kept his head in a hopeless situation.  The whole film leads up to the famous scene where Aron got free the only way he could, by severing his arm.  That scene is very graphic and hard to watch, but it is short.<br /><br />The movie is a testament to one man's courage and resourcefulness.  It doesn't get five stars from me because Aron is a flawed character and also because he  seems to know what to do all the time so a certain amount of tension is missing.  This movie would be of special interest to climbers and hikers.

1439177783|5.0|I just finished this book two days ago. To my surprise, I sped through it in two nights, keeping me up when I meant to use it as my book to \\"fall asleep to.\\" Little did I know how suspenseful Portia de Rossi's book was! Although you would know about how her life is going now if you kept up with celebrity news (and I'm one of those), it still ends up being a page turner as you never know the personal turmoils of public figures quite intimately as how Ms. de Rossi chronicles it in her memoir.    I know many have covered in their reviews the topic of eating disorders, and to a lesser extent, Ms. de Rossi' struggles with her homosexuality, but I want to offer a different perspective. For myself, I was deeply moved by Portia's memoir because she accurately captured the hell it is of \\"not being good enough\\". I have not suffered an eating disorder, nor have I had to experience the struggles of coming out, but I can identify with Portia's mountain of insecurities (in my own case, I've grown up with a mother with unrealistically high expectations for my personal success and then I worked in a professional field -design- where a daily part of the work is being critical/insulting of your work, and many times, of your own self). Whatever the external issues that cause the insecurities, Portia shows us vividly how a person can internalize these issues to very negative results. Some of the factors that did not help her were: (1) an unrealistic fantasy that turned into an early motivation for success (SPOILER- she had a best friend in Australia who was a straight woman with whom she was in love with), (2) a small group of friends vs. a network of friends (for much of the book, you could count the number of friends she had on one hand), (3) constant positive reinforcement for ultimately negative habits (people praising her weight loss when she was achieving it through 300 calories a day), (4) putting off living her life until she achieved a greater level of success- i.e., not living \\"in the moment\\" (she told herself she would start dating women once she had enough money and success where she could afford to come out as a lesbian), (5) being ashamed of who she was and sadly, not being able to talk to anyone without being laughed at- i.e., some of the small number of people who knew she was a lesbian didn't believe her, and (6) being insecure and for a while, losing sight of who she was (this pretty much being the blanket theme of the memoir, in my opinion).    So you can see, although the two main themes are Portia's struggles with her eating disorders and her sexuality, if you have struggled with who you are and being weighed against unrealistic standards, you can also deeply identify with her. Like Portia, I am learning how to live a healthier life for myself, and I think a previous comment that I read best sums up how Portia has successfully moved on from the struggles that had engulfed a majority of her life: \\"Dr. Anne Dietrich\\" said in her comment in response to the review by the user \\"Music Moves Me\\": \\"Thank you for pointing out the important and necessary role of honesty in the healing process for anorexia and other eating disorders. I found that Ms. de Rossi includes important aspects of recovery in her book, including learning how to accept and value yourself for who you are as a person, rather than focusing on external attributes as a source of self-esteem. There are more inherent components of recovery included in her book than it would appear, such as the importance of social support, honestly looking at oneself, one's feelings and beliefs, how shame is involved, and the potential role of early childhood trauma and loss that should be processed in therapy during recovery, and so forth.\\"    The only criticism I might have is for the epilogue, where Portia mentions her move to veganism. I'm still on the fence about the movement (I am neither for or against it), but I felt that Portia's explanation for why she switched to veganism wasthe only part of the book where I felt like I wasn't reading her own voice. I've read several books about veganism (such as Alicia Silverstone's cookbook \\"The Kind Diet\\" and the \\"Skinny Bitch\\" book), and each time, I feel like every vegan text has the same rote script about why we shouldn't eat animals. As I said before, my criticism was that it didn't read as Portia's voice; I only say this because as a whole, the memoir reads strongly in Portia's personal writing style, so this is my only disappointment.    All in all, I haven't read a book in a long time that has moved me this much. I highly respect Portia for truly having the courage (a word that I feel is cheapened today, but in this case, is well-deserved) to share with us her struggles. Thank you Portia.
030745455X|4.0|The 2nd installment felt and read better to me than the other two Stieg Larrson books because bad n' brash Lizabeth Salander was featured more. Mikael, Berger et.al  are bit players who unfortunately get too much time and attention for this readers attention span. I wish the author could've edited the 3 books into 2.
1439102724|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I love that Picoult's books make you think... the topics always wrap me in.    I read a few reviews stating they felt this was anti-Christian/portraying Christians in a negative light. I did not take that from the book at all. I felt like the group of Christians represented in this book were a very specific \\"type.\\" Max, the ex husband was all but brainwashed by the \\"cult\\" like church he joined--one that preaches one thing but does another...manipulates & desires attention...I know a few such churches in my area, though I would not define this as most churches or Christians.    My favorite Jodi Picoult books are still Nineteen Minutes and The Pact, but this one was good--I had a hard time putting it down and stayed up late reading. I'd highly recommend it, especially if you are familiar with this author!

I don't intend to try to lose weight with this seeing as I am relatively small, but would like to get toned up for bikini season. Jillian is so super motivating and I love that she is always there with you, guiding you through the moves. Her advice really is great and she keeps a positive attitude throughout. I intend to see how fit I've gotten after thirty days! I also love how its quick and used pieces of equipment I already owned. A really great buy for anyone looking for an effective and efficient workout.    As for the annoying introduction- press 'Menu' on your dvd player, and it will skip directly to the workout menu.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|The short version of this review? Femme Fatale (especially the Deluxe Edition) is simply Britney Spears' best album to date. It's everything a Britney fan could ask for. And for those who aren't fans, they will most likely become fans if they like catchy electro dance music.<br /><br />Now for the (very) long version. Femme Fatale is an electro-pop masterpiece that melds pop, techno, and even dubstep together. Every song has fantastic production, creative lyrics, and a star quality that only Britney can pull off. This album is one you will want to listen to whenever and wherever, in the car, at the club, at home, at parties. Britney really put her heart and soul into this album, and it shows through her vocal performance throughout the album as well. Yes, there is a fair amount of production and editing that goes on, but as far as the energy in her vocals (which is something autotune cannot induce),she really has put her best foot forward to make tantalizing dance music.<br /><br />Is Femme Fatale better than Blackout? That is up for you to judge. Femme Fatale is definitely sex-driven, just like Blackout. Every song on this album is different and unique sounding, but there are definitely a lot of similarities to Blackout. Femme Fatale is more like the Blackout 2.0, it's definitely far from the sound of Circus.<br /><br />\\"Till The World Ends\\" and \\"Hold It Against Me\\" are the singles so far for this album. \\"Hold It Against Me\\" is a fantastic song that has a thrusting beat, and the double-entendre is very clever. The album begins with the high-energy \\"Till The World Ends\\", written by Ke$ha. It's an amazing dance anthem complete with chants of \\"woah oh oh oh ohhh\\" and the vocals are fierce and catchy. These two songs are already an amazing start to the album.<br /><br />The next song is a mid-tempo breakup sex jam called \\"Inside Out\\". This is probably one of Britney's best mid-tempos and the lyrics are instantly catchy. We heard dubstep influences in \\"Hold It Against Me\\", and \\"Inside Out\\" is no exception, it takes the influence to the next level. Next \\"I Wanna Go\\" kicks in, and this song is pure fire. The song features some clever whistling, and classic Britney stuttering \\"I I wanna go go all the way way\\". This is definitely a highlight of the album, and you won't be able to get it out of your head.<br /><br />The album stays uptempo with the bubbly \\"How I Roll\\", which is one of the album's most unique songs. Produced by Bloodshy & Avant, Britney sings some jazzy vocals over electronic bubble pops and a beat made out of her own panting.  It's a weird description, but the R&B/Techno-vibe song is very fun and Britney owns it. My favorite lyrics are \\"I wanna go downtown where my posse's at, because I got nine lives like a kitty cat\\". Also, she pulls an \\"If U Seek Amy\\" with the lyrics of \\"You can be my thug tonight\\", but it really sounds like \\"You can be my f**k tonight\\" (which after many listens, I am convinced it's the real lyric).<br /><br />\\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful [Featuring Sabi]\\" has an infectious beat and chorus, featuring a new female rapper named Sabi. The beat is so sick, and Britney delivers some sassy lines. The song is definitely great with some lyrics that make me chuckle, but Sabi's part is just kind of generic and overly auto-tuned. Next is \\"Seal It With A Kiss\\", probably the most hardcore dubstep song on the album, with a hard breakdown in the middle of the song. This song is another one of my favorites as Britney declares her secret love for someone at a party. It also has an identifiable \\"Oooo Oooo Ooo\\" throughout that makes it fun.<br /><br />Will.I.Am features in \\"Big Fat Bass\\" (pronounced base, mind you) which is one of those tracks that has to grow on you, some will like it, others won't. It's basically a Black Eyed Peas song made just for Britney, as the lyrics are pretty straightforward. She coos in her lower register \\"I can be your treble baby, you can be my bass\\" and she says this over and over until the point where \\"treble\\" sounds more like \\"trouble\\". The beat on this song is very good, it swells and includes some flourishing piano in it. Will.I.Am's rap is nothing special either, but I have to give him credit for the practically flawless production. This \\"Womanizer\\" like song is also the longest on the album, clocking in at 4:45.<br /><br />At this point, you are halfway through the album (or more than halfway if you just have the standard edition) and you would expect things to get boring right? Well that's where you're wrong; the last half of the album is just as exciting as the first. The track \\"Trouble For Me\\" is a R&B influenced track with a dirty electro beat molded into it. It's here where Britney's vocals sound the most confident and fierce. She sings about a lover who is trouble for her, but a party must-have for everyone else. This song has a great bridge too, and keeps bumpin' till the inevitable end of the song.<br /><br />\\"Trip To Your Heart\\" is an effervescent, gorgeous, ballad style electro song. It reminds me of \\"Heaven On Earth\\" from Blackout, and a little bit of \\"Breathe On Me\\" from In The Zone. Britney's vocals sound soft and pretty here almost like \\"Everytime\\" from In The Zone. The lyrics are absolutely beautiful \\"Spread my wings out into the dark, I'll fly away on a trip to your heart / Break these chains that keep us apart, I'll fly away on a trip to your heart\\".<br /><br />\\"Gasoline\\" picks the pace back up with addicting and clever lyrics like \\"Spark and it's like gasoline / I start pumping like a machine / My heart only runs on supreme / So hot / Give me your gasoline\\". The standard length album comes to an end with the incredible \\"Criminal\\" which is another ballad like electro song. The song features a cool flute, and Britney sings about loving a bad boy. The song's lyrics make you to wonder if she is talking about her ex: Kevin Federline. Either way, this is a pretty and entertaining song that ends the standard album on a good note.<br /><br />The bonus tracks bring the deluxe album back to party mode with the electric, addictive \\"Up `N Down\\". This song is so good and dirty with an amazing bridge, and this song definitely should have been included on the standard edition track listing. \\"Selfish\\" is equally amazing, with classic Britney pronunciation of the word \\"selfish\\", which sounds more like \\"seyylfesh\\".<br />My favorite lyrics from the chorus are \\"Boom boom baby, pick you up in my Mercedes\\".<br /><br />\\"He About To Lose Me\\" has guitars that remind me of P!nk song, and features Britney's most raw vocals. That is until you get to the chorus, which doesn't sound anything like her. Still, this song is catchy and emotional, probably the only other song not talking about sex. Then the last song is a complete oddball (but really a hidden gem) song, it's a rock/pop song called \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" which doesn't fit the electro sound of the rest of the album. What's great about this song is how unique it is, I don't think I can remember the last time Britney sang a rock song. The vocals are very confident and I can totally imagine her rocking out while recording it.<br /><br />As far as the title, her involvement, and concept goes, I would say all these songs fit the concept in a sort of effortless way. Britney doesn't need to try hard to be seductive with her music, she just is seductive with her music. Would it be safe to say she is a femme fatale? Definitely. Seven albums in to her career and she can still captivate us with her image, style and vocal presence. The very fact that Britney didn't write even one song on this album just proves how she easily makes ANY song that she is willing to record her own, and she does it with her undeniable spirit and a voice more unique than any other pop artist on the scene. She doesn't need to be a fantastic songwriter to make amazing music that is exclusively all her own, and neither did some of the greats like Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley. Even the contemporaries of today don't write much of their own music, take Rihanna's Loud for example. Britney has a had a lot of creative involvement throughout the years, whether it be coming up with a music video idea, choosing album pictures, or co-writing some of her biggest hits (\\"Me Against The Music\\" and \\"Everytime\\"). I would hope that seven albums into her career that we would stop questioning her talent, voice, creative drive, and rather be accepting of it. The best thing Britney has done for a decade now is sing, dance, and deliver fantastic pop music. If anything, Britney has earned her Ph.D in the art of seduction via music.<br /><br />Overall Femme Fatale is an amazing record, Britney's best if I dare say so. Or at the very least a flawless equal match to the magnificent Blackout. It has all types of songs, and really nothing on it disappoints me. The vocals are amazing (she experiments every part of her range, from the high notes in \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" to the lows of \\"Big Fat Bass\\"), the production is consistently flawless, the beats and lyrics are top-notch, and the album stands alone as a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind, dance record. This album is where Britney is completely in her zone; giving her fans the best music she's ever made. This album is far better than anything the other Pop divas of today (Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Beyonce, Rihanna) have put out in the past year or so. Only Britney can pull an album like this off anyways. I would very highly recommend this album to any and all Britney fans, but also to anyone who is looking for amazing, feel-good, dance, avant-garde, pop music. I am so proud of and thankful to Britney and her producers for making this album; it really is a pop masterpiece for 2011.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 Stars or an A+ive \\"Up `N Down\\".

B004E2XAHK|5.0|Within Temptation definitely took their time making a new CD and I can easily say that this is one of their most solid releases up to date. Somehow they have matured in their sound and managed to produce a five star album with absolutely no filler songs, strong lyrics and wonderful music. With this album the band seems to have taken a turn towards a more hard rock sound as opposed to an ethereal sound that was evident in their \\"Mother Earth\\" and \\"Silent Force\\" releases. \\"The Unforgiving\\" is closer in similarity to \\"The Heart of Everything\\". Sharon's vocals have gone from angelic, to a darker more angry and emotion filled. For this CD the vocals are a perfect fit and really add to the atmosphere of the release. Meanwhile as a personal preference I am in no way a fan of comic books in general which was the intended theme for \\"The Unforgiving\\", the lyrics in the songs can be a perfect fit for any sort of situation and can be interpreted in different ways depending on the individual listening to them. Speaking of lyrics, I really feel this release has the strongest written lyrics out of any of their albums. It can be easily heard that they are no beginners in the symphonic metal genre and possibly produced the best album of 2011 leaving Sirenia behind.<br /><br />Choosing \\"Faster\\" as the stand out single for their release may not be in their best interest I feel, because it seems like the weakest track on their album. Any number of their songs such as \\"Shot in the Dark\\" or \\"Lost\\" would have showcased their talents to a higher degree. Meanwhile I have mentioned there are no filler songs, Within Temptation has the two best slower paced songs on this album titled, \\"Fire and Ice\\" and \\"Lost\\". They both start out slow, seem like a ballad and then crunching guitars with emotion filled vocals. Something that the music scene has definitely been needing. \\"Sinead\\" does provide a small flashback to the 80s rock scene, but Within Temptation manages to make it their own signature sound once again and strays away from making the track seem cheesy or not good enough. The rest of the tracks such as \\"Murder\\", \\"Iron\\", and \\"A Demon's Fate\\" are filled with driven vocals, heavy guitars, and catchy choruses. This is one CD that can be listened to over and over again and one will never get tired of. I feel as a long time fan of Within Temptation that this CD will not disappoint. The only disappointment that may be seen as such to some people is that there aren't really slower angelic songs or ethereal vocals present, but that is balanced out by the added killer good guitar solos. Overall, this is a very strong album that is sure to shine Within Temptation in their once again deserved spotlight as one of the best symphonic metal bands out there.again and strays away from making the track seem cheesy or not good enough.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|I, too as with a previous reviewer, was skeptical with this new CD release from just listening to the short soundbite samples.  This is until I viewed online videos of Kylie's Aphrodite Les Follies Tour.  Soon to be touring the US cities in May, this amazingly epic show visually hit me like a mega-ton explosion!  That's when I purchased my ticket to experience what fans were talking about all this time.  A ginormous avalanche of rave reviews have already been pouring in from European audiences.  And my consolation is listening to this awesome setlist on CD while awaiting with anticipation her show's arrival.  I feel and the much starved US fans will agree...this Aphrodite release (along with a couple of live TV prime time appearances) is just the appetizer of what is to come when Kylie invades this side of the pond.  Until then I'll just flip on the CD and vibe out to all the talent, beauty and love The Goddess brings!
B003UESJFG|5.0|An awesome movie from beginning to end, Megamind is great for children and adults. The characters were funny and entertaining. Definitely an interesting take on the classic hero/villian relationship. I just wish this Two Disc Combo included a digital copy.
B0037XPP7U|5.0|I ordered this DVD through Amazon.  It came well packaged and quickly.  I also enjoy the great price opportunities that Amazon can offer on so many of its items.    I felt that this was an extremely well done movie, and the blue ray feature enchanced the enjoyment.  I felt that the photography was outstanding in both of the Elizabeth movies with Cate Blanchett, as was the soundtrack. There were a few scenes that had such beautiful scenery . . . beautifully captured. The actors seem to have been chosen with great care and thoughtfulness.  Sometimes after watching a film, I find myself feeling that perhaps a different actor might have been a better choice in a particular role, but that was not the case here.     I enjoy watching the occasional well-done period piece, and this version of the life of Queen Elizabeth seemed to have something for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to watching it again.  It is one that I will keep in my library.

B004KSQN7C|2.0|Britney has fallen and she can't get up. This is simply her least inspired disc ever..and that is saying something. Almost exclusively produced by max martin and dr luke....who are responsible for nearly every hit record of the past year or two... This album struggles to have a original flavor...its lacks oomph that every previous britney album had. This is all ke$ha type material...which is not a compliment. Each track sounds like it was simply made mechanically...like the skeleton of a song was simply replicated and then the melody was tinkered with slightly.     the fact is that there is no story here. blackout was Britney being vulnerable like never before and being exploited in the name of the almighty dollar. Circus was about her triumphant personal comeback. Neither involved her actually caring about the projects enough to sing live or at least dance like her life depended on it. But it didn't matter, as the money spent on studio time would attest. This time there is no personal turmoil that the public is obsessing about...pressure lies solely on the quality of the music itself...and the project collapses under its own weight.    Miss Spears can be congratulated for carrying herself with more class than ever in terms of the marketing aspect of the album. Gone are the sexually suggestive pictures. In their place is simple but effective shots of only her face. She can be seen wearing a leotard or two but at least she isn't bending over in a schoolgirl outfit. Perhaps she has finally realized her personal integrity has come in the way of selling herself sexually, and she will have no more of it. This is a striking choice for her, and one that is encouraging.     Remember Britney...you have nothing left to prove. Leave them wanting more.
B002V9PEU4|5.0|it mixes comedy and action with Arnold Schwarzenegger on screen and real life persona. they have great jokes in the film and the action is great i just don't understand why people hated this so much? i guess they weren't ready for him to make a action comedy that parodied himself and Hollywood.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|These are my initial thoughts after using Amazon Mp3 app fro few hours    Must  1) Lacks Genre tab in the player  2) Lacks a bigger widget with cover art  3) Lacks a lock screen control with cover art  4) Splits up an album if there are different singers on it, this is pointless.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|I recently watched the movie with my daughter and I did not know what to expect.<br />I will tell you I was thoroughly impressed and the innner message of the movie was gleamed by me and my daughter. An abusive step father had her institutionalized and she developed a plan to escape it all. I liked it and so did my daughter.<br />The only thing we did not like is the ending but in some kind of poetic way perhaps that was the only way to end it. But I would have done it differently perhaps they can have a different<br />ending to the DVD
B004NS710C|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked the fast pace and constant suspense.  I even enjoyed the two lead actors arguing with each other.      One scene really bothered me, watching it the second time.  This is not a spoiler, and I don't want to spoil it for others. But in the middle of the movie, when they put a locomotive in front of the train to try to slow it down, why couldn't they have had a second man hop from the one locomotive to the other, and shut it down?  That seems a lot more safe to me than all of their other attempts to board the runaway train, like trying to jump on it from a helicopter, or from a pickup truck.  Of course that would have ended the movie at that point.   I give it 3.5 stars.  Any movie that employs shaky camera work, automatically loses points with me.  It is an annoying little fad in hollywood movies these days, that I hope will soon fall out of favor.  These producers and directors are not being as realistic as they think.  The next time you see someone riding a bike down a rough road, notice how stable their head is, as their body and bike absorbs most of the shocks.  The only thing a movie accomplishes by shaking the camera, is to make half the audience sick.
B004LFO0ME|5.0|Let me start by saying some will like this album and some won't.  At the end of the day its just music and everybody has their own opinion.  This album is something I can enjoy from start to finish.  Preview the tracks and decide for yourself if you'd be interested in getting it.  The features included fit in well and the fact that there was only 3 doesn't kill the album.  Overall the album is hella sick and I have no complaints other then Wiz stepping more into the mainstream and getting more commercialized musically.    A couple favorite tracks of mine:  1-Wake Up  2-Fly Solo  3-Rooftops
B004G6009K|4.0|I was really surprised by \\"Tangled.\\" It is everything i had hoped [[ASIN:B0034JKZ3G The Princess and The Frog]] would be. Sure, I loved \\"Princess And The Frog,\\" but \\"Tangled\\" is close to perfection in all the major ways: characterization, story, style, and even song. Although I question all the brouhaha about renaming \\"Rapunzel\\" so that the male audience wouldn't get turned off by another Princess movie, I fully support the final product! The movie is current yet classic; edgy yet traditional; in short...great Disney entertainment.<br /><br />Flynn Rider is one of the first truly dimensional male leads in a Disney film in years; Zachary Levi does a great job of voicing a character who is more than just a handsome piece of cardboard. Mandy Moore is more than able as the voice for the lead, giving Rapunzel plenty of gumption and a thirst for life after having been couped up in the tower for so long. Although I LOVED the movie [[ASIN:B0049GYXCC Enchanted]], I was less than thrilled with Susan Sarandon's villainess. She almost seemed to walk through the role, lacking the proper subtle menace needed to really create a dark and scary character capable of doing evil deeds. Not a problem here though; Donna Murphy makes Mother Gothel, the evil woman who stole Rapunzel from her royal parents at birth, one of the scariest (albeit subtly) Disney villainesses in a long time. When she tells Rapnzel not to ask her about leaving the tower again, you know she means it!<br /><br />The story is familiar, but here goes a Reader's Digest version: Mother Gothel steals Rapunzel as a baby so that her magical hair will keep her (Mother Gothel) eternally young. To ensure Rapunzel doesn't get wise to the theft, she poses as Rapunzel's mother and locks the young girl away in a secluded tower, constantly warning her that the outside world is evil. As fate would have it, a handsome Robin Hood-esque young man named Flynn Rider is attempting to escape the guards at the Royal Palace, and naturally happens upon Rapunzel's tower while Gothel is gone. Rapunzel sees Flynn as her ticket for a quick escape to see the wonders of the world without Gothel knowing. It should come as no surprise that the best laid plans go awry, and Rapunzel ends up getting much more than she bargained for, with Gothel hot on her trail, desperate to recapture  her fading youth.<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5? First, the picture is perfect. You can practically count the hairs on Rapunzel's head. The beautiful lighting and shading from the Disney Animation Team is shown to its full advantage. And as for the sound...awesome as well! The music surrounds you and you'll be singing the memorable music (\\"Mother Knows Best\\" and \\"When Will My Life Begin\\") right along with the movie. Obviously, my slight beef is not with the music. Instead, it's with the features. It seems obvious that this set is aimed towards the regular (and possibly more youthful) viewer as opposed to the animation-junkie who wants to see the behind-the-scenes documentaries, intense storyboard sessions, and other rare material that would satisfy the deep cravings of a Disneyphile. Instead, there are hip and comical features that are more fun than informative.<br /><br />Here's what you get:<br /><br />-Untangled: The Making of a Fairy Tale: Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi host this featurette that is more trivia-based than anything very serious or scholarly. Again, definitely aimed at the younger set and those who just want to be entertained. For me, the most interesting part was seeing how the hair of Rapunzel was actually animated. Wow...what a challenge to make it look natural.<br /><br />-Deleted Scenes: Co-directors Byron Howard & Nathan Greco introduce 3 scenes (\\"The Jaunty Moose,\\" \\"Chemistry Develops,\\" and \\"Vigor The Visionary\\") and explain why they were cut. I have to admit I get a little annoyed with the Disney \\"deleted scene\\" features on their discs. Most of these haven't even gotten beyond the storyboard point,so I'm not sure they really qualify as \\"deleted.\\" Instead, these are more like ideas that were explored but never really quite finished. All of them slow down the pace and definitely are not missed. Enjoyable, but not missed.<br /><br />-Two Original Storybook Openings: Alternate versions of the film's opening, again introduced by Byron  & Nathan. This is at least interesting to see how it pays homage to classic Disney animation as well as how it evolved over each attempt.<br /><br />-50th Animated Feature Countdown: Fun, but again...more on the fluffy side is this montage of the 49 Disney animated films that preceded \\"Tangled.\\"<br /><br />-9 Tangled Teasers: Another fluff piece...entertaining, funny, and witty...but again, fluff. A series of \\"trailers\\" that take the form of parodies of infomercials and other current commercials/news bits.<br /><br />And that's it...other than the usual bag of previews/plugs for upcoming Disney releases.<br /><br />Please don't let the 4 stars deter you; this is truly a fantastic Disney animated classic that deserves to stand proudly with its predecessors. CGI detractors: it's just another art tool like a pencil...this film has many stunning moments, especially the scenes with the lanterns (you just have to get it to see!).<br /><br />SPECS: 1.78:1 widescreen/enhanced for 16x9 with 7.1 DTS-HD, 2.0 Dolby Digital DVS for Bluray and 5.1 Dolby Digital, 2.1 Dolby Digital DVS for DVD.

1416955070|3.0|I've seen these Mortal Instruments books mentioned everywhere and decided to try them.  It seems that nearly every new or popular YA paranormal series gets labeled \\"the next Twilight\\" at some point.  I'm beginning to suspect it is because they all begin to run together after a while - especially the love triangle bit.  Our heroine Clary falls in love with Jace, a shadowhunter.  Her human best friend, Simon, is in love with her.  While the author does a lot of detailed world-building in this novel, and begins to develop the three-book story arc, that triangle is the focus. And it bored me.<br /><br />The world-building is good, and would have been excellent if it hadn't overly relied on information dumps. There were times where the author spent pages and pages doing so.  There are a lot of familiar tropes, but also fresh ideas to make them feel new.  There is a secret world humanity does not see, and needs protecting from.  Shadowhunters, descended from a mix of human and angel blood, are the guardians.  But, they're not really protecting us from the vampires and werewolves, but from interdimensional demons.  There are some interesting and dynamic characters (I love Magnus, the High Warlock of Brooklyn).  My problem is the romance, which overwhelms the characters. In the midst of mind-blowing revelations about a secret world, her heritage and outright danger our heroine spends too much time consumed by thoughts of Jace and Simon.  Her mother may be tortured and she wonders how she didn't see that Simon loved her?  I understand that teens can be a little single-minded, but really?<br /><br />Overall, I felt that main teen characters were two-dimensional, but the supporting cast and world building were above average.  The book did finally pull me in toward the end, and was interesting enough that I started book two. I hope it's better.
B004SBX112|3.0|If you liked the original or Rio,  this one is just as cute, but don't expect to progress as easily this time. At this point, though, there are better games by other developers with the same gameplay, so don't feel compelled to stay loyal to Rovio. Also, I have no idea why people are injecting appstore complaints into app reviews. It's wasting space and everyone's time.  There are places for feedback,  and it ain't here. If you're angry that you have to be logged in to use Amazon apps, I don't see why. It's just like Steam, and only luddites whine about that.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|This movie blew me away! Just like the wrestler it was a gritty look at the underbelly of a misunderstood art form, in this case, ballet. I'll be the first to admit that a ballet movie is not the first thing i'd usually throw in to the blu ray player, but Black Swan was a film I was more then happy to do so. I'm a huge fan of Darren Aronofsky, I love every single one of his movies, this one takes they cake. it's dark, psycotic, and sexual. If you're looking for a family film then throw this out, but if you want an edge of your seat, psycho-sexual thriller, then give this a try.                              Justin
B004SKEHP2|5.0|I've been a fan of Sum 41 since back in the days of Half Hour of Power and All Killer, No Filler. This album is a bit different than Sum's previous offerings, but ranks right up there with my favorite albums - Underclass Hero and Chuck.<br /><br />The only weak song is the last one - Exit Song - but the rest are outstanding.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if you like Sum 41 then you're probably going to enjoy this album. If you're strictly a fan of the \\"old stuff\\" then maybe it won't be your cup of tea. But in my opinion, for $6 this isn't something to pass up.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I've re-read this book so many times, and it never gets old.  Each time I end up bawling throughout most of it because it is just so touching.  The story is heart-breaking but also inspirational, Picoult did a great job of exploring what goes on in teenagers' minds, and the love story between the two main characters is rather complex, even though they are so young. I would definitely recommend this!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|The cast that was chosen for the 25th Anniversary Concert is AMAZING their voices are so full bold. They cast was able to show their emotions and really pull you in to the show. The voices and sound quality of the cast members harmonize so well together, it's amazing.
B000683VI4|5.0|The notebook presents a very cohesive story that moves from present to past back and forth without being confusing or boring,.you grow to love the couple and their love seems to be the ideal that anyone wishes for,.a bit on the sad side could bring a teary eye while watching,.I'm not into dramas,.but this movie is just amazing,.great locations and wardrobe an extraordinary film.!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recommend this app for anyone hands down. The integration with the online site is amazing and the downloadable versions have been a saving grace when my service is spotty.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great graphics on this one it runs so much smoother than the original cant wait until the next chapter in may. addictive as all hwkl even the &quot;boss&quot; battle was amusing
B004E2XAFW|5.0|1.\\"Why Not Me\\"- It's a just a short introduction and not a song. Mother Maiden introduces the listener to the album and the story ahead.    2.\\"Shot In the Dark\\" The first track of the album is a nice introduction to the sort of music to expect through the rest of the album. It's a rock song through and through and harkens back to the 80's sound the band talked about being influenced from for this album. Sharon sings in her more medium register, which she carries through the rest of the album. About three minutes into the song is a nice, slower bridge before a beautiful guitar riff, really allowing Ruud to show-off his skills.     3.\\"In The Middle of the Night\\" The second song of the album takes their sound in a different direction. Beginning with heavy guitar, this song will sound amazing live. Sharon's vocals are superb and I love how she is always trying something new with her voice. The story continues here through the concept and I think it is clear that there is excitement in the story now. It has a catchy and beautiful chorus and is probably one of their heavier tracks. At point 2:58, there is a beautiful guitar riff and sound that makes the song unique. Definitely one of my favorite tracks.    4.\\"Faster\\" Being their lead single, you've probably heard it before. Faster is a wonderful rock track and carries on the story. Reminiscent of Chris Isaak's \\"Wicked Game,\\" it has that 80's inspiration Sharon spoke of. Overall and good and fun track that pushes along the story of Sinéad    5.\\"Fire and Ice\\" The album slows down here for a beautiful ballad. The song starts of slow, and at about 1:49 picks-up more as Sharon continues her beautiful singing. I like this song very much, it has a more orchestral and epic feel to it and reminds me of older Within Temptation tracks.     6.\\"Iron\\" The album picks-up again with this song, as I am sure the story does too. It has a very catchy chorus and sounds like another song that will sound amazing live. Within Temptation is oneof those bands that makes their songs sound better live than they do on the album. At about 3:27 Mother Maiden speaks again and continues the story along, and then the song falls into some epic music, chorus, orchestra, and guitar. Ruud once again has a chance to really show-off his skills.     7.\\"Where Is the Edge\\" This song first premiered at the end of 2010 with the trailer of a movie. It's not a bad song, but I feel it is one of the weaker ones of the album. It's catchy, it has a great chorus, and compared to a lot of music out today, this song is brilliant and beautiful, but compared to the rest of the album it is not a stand-out song. Sharon's vocals are beautiful and the rest of the band plays well.     8.\\"Sinéad\\" The second single from \\"The Unforgiving,\\" Sinéad once again takes us to a different sound for Within Temptation. The story seems to pick-up here. It sounds like things went bad for Sinéad and they're about to get better. It's a disco beat, and unlike most Within Temptation songs, you could actually dance to this one. The 80's influence is hard to miss here, with the bass beat and it reminds me of the Culture Club's \\"Karma Chameleon.\\" A wonderful upbeat track, and something new and fun. Within Temptation shows they can experiment, while still sounding like \\"Within Temptation.\\" Not to mention there's a beautiful orchestral section fit into a disco sounding song.     9.\\"Lost\\" As we get to the end of the album, in my opinion we begin to hear the best songs. The album slows down here again for a beautiful ballad, where we really get to hear Sharon show us what her voice is made of. This song could very well make a beautiful acoustic song, and as we have seen with their last live album release, they like acoustic. At a concert, lighters would be waving to this song as Sharon really belts it out, Help me I'm buried alive! Buried alive! I know Sharon has a beautiful soprano voice and shows that in all their previous albums. She can even go opera if you just listen to \\"Caged,\\" but in this song she belts, and I can't think of many songs she belts for us. Ruud once again gets to show off his guitar skills toward the end of this power ballad. A very beautiful song.    10.\\"Murder\\" We pick it up again here for one of my other favorite songs on this album. I would assume that the story is really coming to a close here and Sinéad has done something insane. Perhaps murdered someone? That aside, the song is intense. It sounds like it's meant to be watched with a crime and murder movie from the 1940s. The catchy riff gains your attention, and although they mess around with Sharon's voice a little for effect, it doesn't take away from the song, and in fact it adds to the mystery. The chorus is beautiful and symphonic, but my favorite part has to be the creepy choruses that raise their voice through parts of the song. It gets the skin tingling. About 2:45 into the song is a nice bridge and more nice guitar riffs.    11.\\"A Demon's Fate\\" Things stay hot and heavy here as we head to the end of the story. Another guitar filled song with Sharon's beautiful voice taking the stage. Probably one of the more epic and orchestral songs of the album, it still holds onto the rock feel of the rest of the album. Again, another nice and catchy chorus, and Sharon sounds great as she uses her voice throughout the song to deliver beautiful vocals and carry on against the music. Another beautiful guitar solo at the about the 4:20 mark, and a great final heavy song to the album.    12.\\"Stairway to the Skies\\" This is my favorite song on the album. A beautiful, piano driven ballad that closes off the story. Sharon sounds beautiful as she sings of the end. One should assume that things have not gone well for Sinéad, or perhaps another character. I don't know why I love this song the most, but perhaps I just feel it grip at the heart. For someone who has ever lost someone, it's easy to relate to. But even if you haven't, this song sounds like the endof a beautiful movie, and the main character just died and is staring at heaven, waiting for an entrance in. The music is worthy of a movie soundtrack, and the attention of the listeners. I think this solemn track is a great finish to the album, mostly because it fits a story that I can't wait to read.     13.\\"I Don't Wanna\\" (Bonus Track) The first bonus track on the digital Special Edition. I can see why it wasn't included on the album, it doesn't fit the nice flow of the rest of the songs, and I don't think stands out as much. However, it's still not a bad song and is enjoyable enough.     14.\\"The Last Dance\\" (Bonus Track) This song is one of those bonus songs that deserved to be on the album, but for the sake of the concept, I can see why it didn't. Sharon finally sings in her higher register here and sounds beautiful. It has a different feel to it than rest of the songs on \\"The Unforgiving\\" and harkens back to \\"Mother Earth\\" and \\"The Silent Force\\" sounds. There also seems to be a Native American musical influence in this song, which is interesting. Nightwish went this direction with Creek Mary's Blood, and this is Within Temptation's take. Very beautiful, and worth a listen.     15.\\"Empty Eyes\\" (Bonus Track) The final bonus track of the album, is another new sound. Like all the bonus tracks, I see how it might not fit the overall flow of the main portion of the album; however, also like the rest of the bonus tracks, I think it's a wonderful song. I'm glad they didn't just let it get buried on the cutting room floor. It reminds me of Lacuna Coil a little, but not so much I'd say it's a Lacuna Coil song. Worth listening to.       Conclusion: It's been 4 years since Within Temptation has released anything new (aside from the song `Utopia') and it was a long time coming. The announcement that they were doing a concept album got me excited, even though I didn't know what sort of concept they had in mind. I like the comic book idea, it's not used that often, and it really allows the listener to know the story the songs follow. As for the album, I think it's very good. It's different from their earlier work, but one thing Within Temptation doesn't do, is the same thing twice. Enter and the Dance are different from Mother Earth, as Mother Earth is different from The Silent Force, and the Silent Force is different from The Heart of Everything. For first time fans, it's a great introduction to the band, if you're not a fan of the larger symphonic sounds of their earlier music, and for old fans, it's another great release from a great band, if you're willing to accept that they will never make Mother Earth or The Silent Force again.

B0042816YK|4.0|Eat Pray Love starring Julia Roberts has gotten some harsh reviews but I enjoyed this real-life story about a woman's journey to find her own path in life. Roberts performance is quite good and I like how she takes time to really learn who she is as a woman without a man defining who or what she is. Yes, she does break some hearts including her husbands and her rebound boy toy but Robert's character is trying to find her own happiness instead of depending on a man's \\"idea\\" of happiness. Along the way, she does learn to love again but first she must learn to love herself. I didn't think this film was self-indulgent or boring, check it out!

0061726826|5.0|Back cover:   \\"They say that the cure for love will make me happy and safe forever. And I've always believed them. Until now. Now everything has changed. Now, I'd rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years smothered by a lie.\\"      More info:   In the (not too distant?) future, everyone lives in fear of contracting the deadly disease Amor Deliria Nervosa--or love. Everyone must receive the 'cure' on their eighteenth birthday, and before that time 'uncureds' of the opposite sex are kept strictly segregated. Before their procedures they are evaluated, and then given a pre-approved list of a few names to choose who they will marry. The government decides whether or not they will attend college, what sort of job they will have, and how many kids they will have. Falling in love--or even listening to any 'dangerous' music or reading poetry--is illegal. Sympathizers are thrown into the Crypts to rot. And beyond the electrified fence that protects the border is the Wilds, where the Invalids (uncured resisters) are rumored to live. Seventeen year old Lena is 95 days away from having the procedure which she believes will make her happy and safe. But then she meets Alex. And she begins to develop feelings for him--feelings that she has been warned are dangerous and deadly her whole life. Now, Lena questions everything she has ever been told as she risks her safety to be with Alex.        Writing:  The story is told in first-person through seventeen year old Lena's eyes, and is very well-written. The pacing is steady through most of the book, though not in a bad way. It's not action packed or fast-paced but is still a page-turner. The story mostly focuses on internal, emotional conflicts, but there is also the external conflict of the world Lena lives in the threatens her and Alex's love.       The Dystopian world Lauren Oliver creates is both chilling and fascinating, and holds the reader's interest with intrigue. The author doesa great job of developing the world and making it feel real--the exerpts from history & science books, children's nursery rhymes, etc., at the top of each chapter from that world makes it all the more realistic. The characters are likeable and by the time you reach the end of the story character development is easy to see, especially in Lena. My only complaint really was that I didn't really feel attached to Alex.      Recommendations:  At first I was reluctant to read this book because I've never read a Dystopian novel before and I wasn't even sure what Dystopian meant exactly until I looked it up--a nightmare world, opposite of a utopia. But I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did! You do not want to miss this book! It's very thought provoking, and a refreshing change from all the other YA stuff out there. If you need a break from vampires, werewolves, faeries, etc. this is the book for you. I did not want to put this book down, and even took it to work to read as many pages as I could during my short 15min break. And when I couldn't read it I couldn't stop thinking about it, itching to pick it back up. Lauren Oliver sucks you into the world she has created so easily that you forget that you're reading a book. This is the first in a planned trilogy, the subsequent titles being Pandemonium and Requiem. (According to Lauren Olvier's site set for a Feb. 2012 and Feb. 2013 release, respectively).  I highly recommend Delirium!!
B003M6OXMA|5.0|This was the episode that earned my affection for the new Doctor Who.  After something of a mixed bag in \\"Rose\\" this episode showcases what the Russell Davies led new show would be.  On the surface it is a fun and witty romp at the end of the earth full of colorful aliens and with more than a wink towards current pop culture; it is a show that doesn't take itself as seriously as most of the classic Who.  Simultaneously, however there are dark and moody undertones and an emphasis on the main characters and their emotions that serves to give the show more adult and moving moments than most sci-fi. Companion Rose is still the showcase here and it is clear why she became so popular so quickly.  She is sympathetic and understandable (as in the scene with the alien plumber) yet headstrong and full of her own point of view (as in her ill-advised argument with Cassandra).  The doctor, after his muddled start in \\"Rose\\" also becomes clearer here and the dark tortured soul under the glib exterior begins to be revealed. The two dimensional Cassandra (literally a piece of skin stretched between posts with a brain in a jar connected from below) makes a great, comic and original villain.  This is where the show found its footing and definitely one of the must-sees of the first season (along with \\"Dalek\\", \\"Father's Day\\", \\"The Empty Child\\", \\"The Doctor Dances\\" and the last two episodes.

Britney has been around for too long to be regressing into a sound-a-like diva.  She has always had her own sound, even with the many cover songs she has released,  unfortunetly only the second half of this release showcases that.<br /><br />  The lyrics are all beyond simple and seem to be based on \\"one liners\\",  that have been tossed around over the years.  Basically they lack originality,  and this is kinda disapointing.  As for the music...again I must point out,  if songs 1-9 were not \\"tracked out\\" for you....could you even tell where one song stopped and the other started.<br /><br />  I give this release a 3 because I have always been a fan and I really do like tracks 10-16.  Had just theses tracks been released on an EP..I would be giving it a 5.  I'll close with a note to Britney: \\"You have star power & presence, get back to being the spotlight rather than just trying to live in it.\\"

B002N5N4M6|5.0|What else can I say?  I love this show, I am so glad Jim Parsons got those Emmy's, he deserved them and if he keeps it up he'll deserve them for many years to come.  Maybe they'll recognise that the show deserves one too!  If you're wondering if you should buy this, all I have to ask is this, have you SEEN the first two seasons?  Then what's wrong with you?  Why haven't you bought this already!?
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This might be Joe's best album to date ! Right up there with Blues Deluxe, and Had To Cry Today.   Great songs, some good special guest appearances, and tremendous guitar-playing. This is the best new release of the year.  What more can I say ?
B0039UTDA6|5.0|I bought this on Blu Ray after seeing it on TV. It's very good. Interesting material, gorgeous camera shots and really entertaining. I love learning about nature and this really goes into all the corners of the earth from the largest to the smallest. Also has selections about plants and insects. I enjoyed it very much. I think a lot of people rating it badly just really love David Attenborough and don't want to see a series orinally narrated by him, narrated by anyone else. He being the naturalist and Oprah a talk show host. But honestly I've seen David Attenborough's Planet Earth after reading these reviews about him being so tremedous and he didn't knock my socks off. His voice kinda put me to sleep at times. Maybe if you grew up with him and that's what you're used to I get it but he just didn't do it for me. So if I had to choose I would choose Oprah's narration and David's expertise. Don't be fooled-this is actually a very good series and version. A lot of people just A. Don't like Oprah or more likely B. Are upset Oprah was chosen to narrate the US version instead of their beloved David Attenborough. I understand having a preference but I really don't think it's fair to slam this one with over 200 1 star reviews just because people don't like who narrated it. Especially when it's actually really good! And I think Oprah did an excellent job. And I'm not a huge Oprah fan. Just being an honest reviewer.
0670022411|5.0|I loved that book and could not put it down, sleeping only a few hours a night. Nothing much got done at home and meals were quickly prepared!  I like the characters and the story.  The fact that the book was quite a big book was also good, sometimes, when a book is too thin, the story is lacking and the character are not as developped!  I won't go into the story but if you like adventure and some romance, fantastic heroes with their amazing talents but also weaknesses, go for it.  I cannot wait for the next book!
B00005N6KG|3.0|Sound is great, fits nicely into my ears. Only draw back is the location of the wires that tend to get in my way quite often while running, but its not a deal breaker. For less than $10, I'd say I got a good deal!

B002PN3J9E|5.0|Coaches, Teachers and Parents, you don't want to miss this Book/Audio. In the Talent Code we learn about creating passion and igniting fire (passion).<br /><br />The research and many examples show us that ability can be created and nurtured.<br />Brains are like muscles. The more you use it, the smarter you become. Success is not chance, it is deliberate.<br /><br />\\"The Talent code\\" has a strong focus on Myelin, how to cultivate and develop myelin for memory and growing the brain (Coyle explains the exact biology). World-class skill, like art, writing, soccer or skateboarding or anything else requires 10,000 hours of deep practice - firing and honing skill circuits. Another key to learning is the need to make errors & corrections.<br /><br />This is an important book, which teaches the laws of learning. If you want to learn effective teaching methods, get this book. To quote Daniel Coyle, \\"Greatness isn't Born, it's Grown\\" and he proves it.<br /><br />I listened to the audio read by John Telfer and his voice and the sound quality is excellent.
B004M66YSA|5.0|On their self-titled debut, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart explored the tropes and truisms of 1980's new wave and dream pop, layering their poetic, biographical love songs with fuzz and shimmer. Now, on their follow-up, Belong, you can hear the band continuing to explore their style, while simultaneously giving a bigger nod to their influences, including some unexpected references to bands such as '90s alt-rock titans, the Smashing Pumpkins, which are heard throughout the record in the loud-soft dynamics that play in numerous songs (no doubt courtesy of former Pumpkins producer, Flood.)<br /><br />Stylistically, Belong is a little bit more varied than the Pains' debut, with burners that drive harder and ballads that play it softer. However, as far as songwriting goes, Belong doesn't quite top what the band achieved on their first record, though it is certainly an excellent record full of catchy hooks and clever songs. For a band like the Pains, innovation is key. Another record in the exact same vein as the s/t debut would be superfluous and pointless, but with innovation there are naturally missteps, though the band avoided doing anything particularly egregious with any of the tunes. Opener and title track \\"Belong\\" is a powerful mid-tempo ballad (not unlike most of their songs) and sets the stage for the lyrical themes of being an outsider that are found throughout the record. First single \\"Heart in Your Heartbreak\\" is a strong example of the Pumpkins influence heard in this album, with a gradual build of fuzz and distortion until the song really explodes in the last minute. Later on \\"Even in Dreams\\" and \\"Strange\\" are perfect little slices of fuzz pop, rounding out a solid set of songs that don't necessarily raise the bar for this excellent band, but certainly don't lower it even an inch.
B004L3AR0K|1.0|WASTE OF TIME    I cannot believe I actually spent money on this movie. This movie was such   an enormous disappointment. The plot is weak, the actors involved in this   movie certainly surprised me and saddend me. This movie had better not be  PG because basically, it is a skin flick. I could not believe they were   naked in this movie. Terrible waste of time. Don't waste your money. Or   your time for that matter, because you will NOT get that time back. Wish  I could send it back and get my money back for it. :(

0679731725|4.0|This is an icily ironic novel about a man (Stevens) clinging to fading conventions, and his seeming inability to perceive, or at least fully perceive, that he is surrounded by several direct challenges to these values.  The principle challenge in the novel comes in the form of Miss Kenton, whose recent letter has led him on a brief trip to the country.  His reflections on the trip and his own life make up the content of the novel.      A particularly formative experience in Steven's life is in hearing about his father having to serve a general whose incompetence resulted in his brother's (Steven's uncle) death.  Steven's father never revealed his deep loathing to the general in the course of the 4 day service, and was even left with a generous tip, which he subsequently donated to charity.  This early lesson learned from his father, that a butler must never let his personal feelings intrude upon his duties and thus the \\"dignity\\" of the role as a butler, remains foremost in his life.  The reader observes how that role calcifies into an inability to act with emotion, moral conviction, or even simply to casually engage with others.  This is most evident when the new American head of the house tries to engage him in more informal \\"banter,\\" a request which Stevens comically misunderstands.    The precision of Ishiguro's prose (which is the voice of the narrator and main character, Stevens) reflects perfectly executed manner that that Stevens is trying to achieve in his role as butler.  In the end, there is brief, though real suspense as we witness whether and how Stevens will integrate his new circumstances into his values appropriate to another age.

1401923127|4.0|As an author of a future book  on \\"Spirit, Soul and Brain - A Systems model\\"  I found this book useful  as research data,  though the biology is often  beyond my needs at the moment.   Plus  this book follows the medical science error that the brain is the center of thought. It is not!  the Mind (a non-physical field of energy)  is the primary thought processor!I have been in a  body  of a stroke victim (my own)  and can prove the distinction!  Larry Morrison
0439023513|5.0|I'm going to try not to be spoiler here.   The story would've lost all credibility had it been all fine and dandy and neat and pretty.  There is no way someone could have gone through what Katniss did in the first two books and still manage to keep it all together, it's just not realistic.  I'm happy the author made her human, in fact, for me, she made her even more human.  I thought it was a great finish to a wonderful series.  Well Ddne!
1594202842|5.0|Many quotes in this book were taken out of context.  If you actually buy the book and read it, you will find that those terrible quotes were actually tongue in cheek.  That being said, the content of the book is still shocking for most of us.<br /><br />My parents were nothing like Amy Chua.  They were exact opposite, letting me do anything I wanted.  They were hands off rather than hands on.  I still did very well, got As in school and the like.  However, I know that I would have done much better if I had a mother like Chua standing behind me.  I almost wish I did.<br /><br />On the other hand, a mother like Chua would drive me away if she insisted that I play an instrument I didn't want to play.  An important lesson that I found in Chua's book is that you should push your children to succeed in their goals instead of your own.  Chua's oldest daughter wanted to learn the piano.  That's why she excelled.  But her younger daughter had other interests, which was apparent as early as three years old.  The book is about the tiger mother method succeeding and failing with these two children.  Had the younger daughter wanted to learn the piano or the violin, I believe Chua's parenting style would have helped her match her sister's achievements.<br /><br />I strongly recommend reading this book.  Despite the fights and the conflict, I felt a lot of love in the pages.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This is a great movie!!  My 9 year old and my 3 year old both watched it all the way through and wanted to watch it over and over again.
B004LFO0ME|5.0|I've been listening to Rolling Papers for a couple days now, probably a good 15 - 20 times in total.  Wizzer has more hits than misses on this album, and overall, it's a solid effort with quite a few songs that lead me to recommend a purchase to a hip hop enthusiast or Wiz fan.  I was bordering on 4, but I have to give it 4.5 out of 5.    Review:  I've been a Khalifa listener for a couple years now, owning his previous albums and mixtapes (favorites include 'KxOJ', 'How Fly', 'BAR', 'Deal or No Deal' and 'Flight School' - can you tell I'm a fan?), and attending two of his concerts.  Lyrically, on this outing, you're not going to find 2Pac.  But, you don't come to Wiz for the lyrics; you come to Wiz for a varied, catchy flow over interesting production. Most regular listeners know what to expect from Mr. Taylor Gang at this point: feel good tunes about smoking weed, partying, getting money and women; the standard hip hop topics.  I did enjoy the tracks where he went a bit deeper; notably on Fly Solo, and Cameras.  The man even sings on a somewhat regular basis, which is an enjoyable aspect of his talent. The production here isn't revolutionary by any means, but there are a few standouts including (of course) Black & Yellow as well as The Race and Fly Solo.  I also enjoyed the production on Hopes and Dreams, Top Floor, and Rooftops.  I honestly expected this album to be more airplay-oriented, but he surprised me and only has a couple blatantly radio-friendly songs.  I was pleasantly surprised on my first listen through.    TL;DR review:  Essential Tracks-  1. Black & Yellow (I've probably heard this song ~1,000 times and am somehow am not tired of it; perfect marriage of beat & flow).  2. The Race (barely lost out to B&Y; excellent production and top-notch replay value).  3. No Sleep (probably going to be on the radio 5 times an hour this spring/summer... but that's OK).  4. Top Floor (fun production).  5. Fly Solo (guitar-centric production and more abstract lyricism).  6. Rooftops (Curren$y feature... got to love it).    Skip These Tracks -  1. Roll Up (makes me want to smack myself for listening).  2. Get your Sh** (seems like a rushed break up song, mail-in chorus).
1597801585|5.0|Wonderful book.    For those complaining about the difficulty of the few Thai words in the book, not sure what your gripe is about.  He always covers his tracks by saying things like... \\"their phii, their ghosts, were around\\".    Moreover, the Thai words he chooses to print are exactly the ones that are necessary... they are critical Thai words that are ever-present in Thai culture now.  In fact, the fear of phii is so great that you will likely get shouted down if you mention the word to anyone in Thailand.  His use of Thai words is akin to, say, the use of \\"schadenfreude\\" to express a concept and idea that doesn't easily have a US translation.  Indeed, jai yen, jai rawn, jai dee, etc, are expressions of a person's countenance and being that don't necessarily correlate to \\"happy person\\", \\"angry person\\" etc... they are uniquely Thai.    (Weirdly, he chooses NOT to use the Thai words for certain words, perhaps to avoid confusion.  One of the most common words that you hear in Thailand is \\"pi\\" (meaning elder brother/sister)... perhaps because of its possible confusion with phii he chooses just to use \\"Elder Sister\\" instead.)    As a farang who has spent a great deal of time in Thailand, I was struck by his careful elaboration of this society, and how well he did.  The only things that got me was saying people prostrated before Rama 7... weird, that, as it is Rama 5 and Rama 9 that are the most popular.  As well, the wai is traditionally a bow down with hands clasped... the bow UP, as sometimes occurs in the novel, is traditionally for royalty (e.g., Rama 5) and not now known in Thailand.  I guess he is indicating that this supreme show of reverence returns in the future.  Interesting.    In the acknowledgments the author expresses thanks to friends in Chiang Mai for tour guiding him.  I would have thought that he spent many decades on Thailand to get the vibe of that country right.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|It is a fun album to work out to or dance to...I wish she had more lyric input, but she usually writes her ballads...and this album doesn't have any slow pace songs. The slower songs are \\"Trip to Your Heart\\" and \\"He about to Lose Me\\" (from deluxe version). Her voice is not so computerized like it was in Blackout and Circus...but it still has some alterations to give the songs a techno feel.   I recommend this if you need some upbeat songs in your ipod to hit the gym or have some driving fun! There are no deep songs, this album sticks to the superficial side of music...and well, it is POP music.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|listened to it 10-15 times when it was streaming for free a month ago, and now finally bought it when it became available on itunes and amazon (at a cheaper price!)    really appreciating how beautiful and addictive this album is after one month not listening to it. a real grower.
0307405095|5.0|This is a beautiful book. Gorgeous images, and as all things Martha tend to be, it is a pleasure to look at and inspires me to try new things.   The book includes many reliable go-to classics such as apple (just tried this, incredible!), pecan and Key lime pies.  However, the recipes which most interest me are those which include more interesting and unlikely combinations: fresh orange and yogurt tart, banana and coconut cashew cream tart, lime curd tartlets in meringue shells.  I love that there are some obscure fruits finally headlining here too: gooseberries, pluots, quince, red currant. Chocolate lovers won't be disappointed either. Would make a great gift for beginning and advanced bakers alike!

B0040JHF28|5.0|These are very fine recordings, done with a great deal of intelligence.  Diane has a perfect voice for these songs -- clear, careful, but passionate.  In a song like \\"Morgen\\" you actually get images of sun and shining in her tone.  I tend to prefer Janet Baker and Gerald Moore's version of \\"Morgen\\" (simple piano is better than orchestra, I never could go for the schmaltzy violin) but she is just as good.      Some of the songs are admittedly over the top -- Cacile is pretty crazy (is this a love song or a shipwreck on the high seas?) -- and \\"Amor\\" (a tour de force for her voice) really needs to be heard in a Vienna cafe -- but it is all lovely listening.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|awesome start by amazon. the cloud player is the best thing that's happened to Android so far. minimalist app with all useful features. hope to see more updates.
0670022411|5.0|It is hard to know where to begin talking about this amazing book. At first I was intimidated by its large size and dense print. But once I began it, I hated the idea of having to stop reading for unimportant things like eating, sleeping, and working. I was swept away into the life of a young woman from a heritage filled with witches who has been trying to deny that she has any abilities. She has carved out a life as a noted scholar who studies the history of science and particularly alchemy.<br /><br />Her life changes beyond her wildest dreams when she calls up a book from the Bodleian Library that has been lost for centuries and has been sought after by both vampires and witches. She meets Matthew Clairmont who is a vampire and also a noted scholar at Oxford. At first she resents his interference in her life (and she has been taught that vampires and witches should never mix). He soon becomes the one person that she can trust as her life becomes chaotic.<br /><br />I loved the relationship between Diana and Matthew as they got to know each and trust each other and fall in love. I also liked the historical detail and rich language in the story. I liked the references to real world books and real world characters. I liked the supernatural world that Ms. Harkness created with vampires and witches and daemons. The complex balance of power especially between the witches and the vampires made very compelling reading.<br /><br />The book is filled with a large number of well-developed characters including Diana's two aunts and Matthew's mother and son. I would be eager to read more about all of their stories. The villains were very nicely creepy and scary.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story and look forward to more from the author. This book was not an easy or a quick read but it was a very rewarding read for the patient reader. The ending wasn't a cliffhanger exactly but I know there is more story out there and can't wait to read it.
0756404738|5.0|This is one of those books you actually enjoy the whole book!   I was amazed that at no point did I ever get a section of the book I wanted to skim through.  I hope the next book will be released in a timely manner...

Have passed it on to friends who are now equally as hooked.
B000056H24|5.0|Among the various outstanding Jesus movies, this one which I found at first to be too slow and boring in places has now become probably my favorite.     Watching The Greatest Story Ever Told about once a year over several years, I always enjoyed it only in spots.  I had my reservations as to whether it was very WELL told.  Then, there came a time when I found myself sinking deeply, patiently, under the spell of the incredible artistry that was observable in every detail of the visual compositions and sound effects involved in this story-telling.    The background chanting, the painterly vistas, the very slowness of the vision's unfolding, all make this movie an experience well-suited to contemplation.  Whether you want to or not, the movie-maker makes sure that you WILL contemplate at least some of this Greatest Story Ever Told. So great it's worth taking a long time to tell, and a long time to view.     As to whether I like Max von Sydow as Jesus, I think I like him better than some other epic-movie Jesuses.  Maybe my favorite Jesus is Jim Caveizal in Mel Gibson's recent focus on the Crucifixion.
B004KSQN7C|1.0|Its sad. she sold herself out so she could try to be at the top. She knew she was going to have tough competition with Gaga, but seriously why did u have to sell yourself out????? She sounds like the new black eyed peas and kesha but 10 times worse! its all meaningless auto toned crap. She claims this is her best album and shes worked so hard on it for the past 2 years. Please! going to a studio , picking a song SOMEONE ELSE WROTE, recording it fast and applying auto tone to it DOESNT MEAN U WORKED HARD. THAT JUST SHOWS HOW LAZY U R. UR performances are lazy too. NO ENERGY, MORE LIP SINGING, NO DANCING (just walking around flapping her arms). WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? PEOPLE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS LISTEN TO EACH SONG AT LEAST 4 TIMES BEFORE BUYING IT. ITS SUCKS. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR LADY GAGAS NEW CD 'BORN THIS WAY'. SHE ACTUALLY WROTE ALL OF HER SONGS AND HAS WORKED VERY HARD ON IT FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. SHES GUARDED THE ALBUM WITH HER LIFE, UNLIKE BRITNEY. GAGA SINGS LIVE AND ACTUALLY DANCES, UNLIKE BRITNEY. YES BRITNEY HAS MADE RECORD BUT SHES DEF NOT THE QUEEN OF POP. SHES THE QUEEN OF LIP SINGING.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Overall, this was a good science fiction-type film, but after two viewings, I do think it's being overrated.  Once you understand the multi-layer scenarios, you also start to see a number of holes.  The film is worth watching and better than most, yet over a period of years, I do not see it making its way into the top ten of many critics' lists.  The premise is not entirely original (see Dreamscape from a few decades ago).  The film asks us to believe that if a person dies during some level of their dreaming, they will die in reality -- much in the same way that Star Trek's Hologram room could prove lethal if set to maximum -- much in the way of \\"Brainscan,\\" an almost two-decades old movie -- much in the way of \\"The Matrix.\\"  In all cases the notion is ludicrous.  So is the idea that someone could \\"live\\" 50 years at a deep level of sleep while in reality the subject might have been unconscious for a few hours or whatever.  The life-threatening scenes encountered by the inceptors seemed like clippings from a James Bond film.  Not only that but with their very lives in peril (within the context of this script), you'd think there would be more at risk than the success or failure of a business espionage endeavor.  Once you start to dissect some of the premises of \\"Inception,\\" you'll realize a good portion of it is pure hokum.  At a first viewing, you will be kind of dazzled, perhaps confused, but, nevertheless, entertained in a way that is almost subliminal.  Discriminating viewers on a second watch will start to see the pitfalls.

0790733226|4.0|I felt the film was faithful to Carl Sagan's novel.  This book adapted itself well to film unlike much of science fiction.  Jodie Foster does all the heavy lifting here -- particularly showing her prowess as a major actress during moments of doubt and introspection.  Her ability to display inner conflict is really amazing.  I enjoyed all aspects of this film -- from the sweet/folksy beginning of a young girl's amazement with the stars, to the same girl's encounter with the unknown and her struggle to validate her experiences in a court of inquiry.  The film grabs you in a personal, emotional way and doesn't let go.  The film forces you to look at the essentially invisible line between faith and science, and that's a big enough goal for any motion picture.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|This album blew me away. I haven't much to say, other than it was awesome enough for me to go out of my way to post a review whilst listen to it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|What is reality?  Are we dreaming or awake?  This movie explores the perception and knowledge of our life and dreams.  Can our dreams be stolen, and how are ideas made?  I would highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to think about their sense of the world!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I love that there's finally an ad-free version of Angry Birds, which has been too far coming, but it seems a lot more crash-prone than the Android Market version (maybe a bug in the Amazon appstore code?)  Otherwise a great game.

B004G6009U|5.0|Rumors of the end of the Disney Princess movies, to paraphrase Mark Twain, \\"have been highly exaggerated.\\" Tangled proved it by being a huge theatrical hit. Part fairy tale, part musical, part romantic comedy, somehow it all came together despite a long, difficult history of behind-the-scenes changes and rearranges, including giving the film a \\"hip\\" title instead of Rapunzel (or as it was known in one incarnation, Rapunzel Unbraided).<br /><br />When the Tangled trailers originally aired, I was apprehensive because of the title change and the skewed trailers with their blaring pop music tracks. Would it be a spoofy, Shrek-y send up? Would Rapunzel herself be the tough-talking \\"today\\" lady so common in recent animation? Would it end with a boogie dancing '80s top-40 chestnut?<br /><br />I needn't have been concerned. Tangled turns out to be a Disney fairy tale in the classic sense that straddles the difficult line between \\"straight\\" storytelling, screwball comedy, romance and yes, even a little suspense -- because, like Cinderella, we know it's all going to be fine but we want to see how it works out.<br /><br />And speaking of Cinderella, there has never been a Disney animated film with a more complicated villain than Mother Gothel since the Stepmother in Cinderella (Cruella and Madame Medusa are close contenders). The evil is all about psychological abuse, the manipulation of a person into submission that is so effective that the victim is compelled to sustain it, even though they yearn for more.<br /><br />How many of us have experienced, or know someone who has experienced, a situation in which we are led to believe that we're \\"lucky to be here\\" or \\"better off than the alternative\\" by a person or a group who knows your true worth but conceals it by convincing you you're not capable otherwise? Who hasn't had the boss/parent/partner/friend who criticized you so much you started to believe you really were worthless? I was astounded to see this complex dynamic dealt with in a Disney animated film.<br /><br />Both Rapunzel and Flynn have self-doubt but they trod on anyway. They didn't start out contemptuously loathing each other the way couples do in way too many films nowadays, either. Their character arcs were the most plausible we'd seen since Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />The Alan Menken/Glenn Slater songs were not tossed in at random just to fill up an album or make a great theme park number (though they probably would), but because they had a crucial book requirement. They all served the story -- and I've Got a Dream\\" was the funniest number since \\"Gaston.\\"<br /><br />Often when the story was just about to approach a clich&eacute;, there was a gag or twist that punctured it. And the horse -- Maximus -- stole every scene.<br /><br />Animation-wise, there was a hand-drawn quality to the expressions that I don't recall in most CG films, especially in the more human-styled characters. In his commentary on Toy Story 3, Lee Unkrich said there had been huge strides in CG humans and clearly both films were able to benefit.<br /><br />Tangled didn't make me get all misty eyed the way that Toy Story 3 did, but it was, in tone, more of a grand epic romp overall. I liked it much more than I thought I would. My wife and kids loved it.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is truly dazzling, making full use of meticulous detail, design and color. The DVD does not contain as many bonus features as the Blu-ray, but there aren't all that many anyway. One highlight is a segment in which lead voice actors Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi breeze through a lighthearted trivia trek which includes a quick rundown of all 50 Disney animated features (a list that has, historically, changed a little bit over the years).<br /><br />There seemed to be no doubt that Mandy Moore was a perfect fit for the singing and acting duties of playing a Disney princess. The surprise is Levi, who has far more range than he often is allowed to display on TV. Clearly he has more stage experience than the unpretentious persona evidenced in various appearances. He even has a decent singing voice.<br /><br />Like Mickey Mouse, who started it all, the fairy tale is the heart of Disney storytelling. They can and should stretch and go outside the box but they should never totally abandon the core form. Nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest...(somebody stop me!)ecent singing voice.    Like Mickey Mouse, who started it all, the fairy tale is the heart of Disney storytelling.

1591843790|5.0|I'm probably a bit biased when writing this review due to the fact i got the book (2 books) for free when i attended his talk in Santa Clara University earlier this evening.    Nevertheless, I believe the book deserves 5 stars due to the collective effort Guy has put into the book and i think this book will help the readers to enchant other people while also preventing them from being taken advantage by other enchanters.    Lastly, I would like to say that having read some parts of the book, you will be stimulated to become a more enchanting person just by thinking through the lessons in this book.    Enjoy!

030726999X|3.0|As with most series, the books get less and less intriguing as the series continues. The Millenium series is no different. The biggest negatives of this installment is 1) its length. It easily could have been cut down a few hundred pages without sacrificing anything to the story. For example, the whole Erika Berger plotline added nothing to the actual story. 2) The Characters. There were an excessive number of characters, all with unusual Swedish names that in my head, all became mixed up together and I was having a hard time keeping the characters and their stories straight. It seemed like there were a lot of \\"B\\" names - Blomqvist, Berger, Bjurman, Borsgjo, Bjork etc. It was very similar to the 101 Vanger family members in the first book that I drove myself crazy trying to keep straight - but eventually you just give up, keep reading, and you in the end Larsson helps you figure out who are the - very - few characters that are actually important to know.<br /><br />Looking beyond that, once the story got going I was hooked. Many readers arent the biggest fans of Lisbeth - I know its asking a lot to digest all of her intellectual and physical capabilities, but she's such an odd, eccentric character that I cant help but love her quirkiness and resourcefulness. Its not her physical strength that helps her to outwit and \\"beat up\\" the bad guys, its her ability to think outside the box and outsmart them. She's one of my favorite characters of all-time. I was really cheering for her and Blomqvist throughout the book and throughout the court case. I read somewhere that if Larsson hadnt died, he was planning on writing 7 books in this series - that would have been wayyyy to much. I think this book ended in the perfect place. It keeps the reader intrigued and wanting more, but really, its just enough.
B000001FS3|4.0|I purchased this CD, because it has the song entitled \\"With or Without You\\" on it, which is one of my favorite songs recorded by this group. When I listened to this CD, I discovered another one of my favorites by this group entitled \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\". Both of which I listened to on the radio when I was kid. So, if you're a fan of the group U2, I would highly recommend this CD.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|One of the legs snapped off as soon as I adjusted them. The metal appears to be one of those cheap plastic-metals. I would never recommend this product. Dollar store toy aisle quality. The mount is spring loaded and almost at its maxium when placing the Iphone4 in. The plastic bows under the strain. I do not know how long it will last. I will keep the top mount as it unscrews. This I screwed on my JOBY GorillaPod Magnetic tripod (which I love). Why I bought this: I wanted a portable tripod for my Iphone4 that would work with the case I already have on my phone.

B004NSULHM|2.0|After more than half a dozen listens I still don't get this album.  Within Radiohead's catalog, even if I didn't prefer a particular album I could at least appreciate the effort and what they were trying to do with it.  Not the case with King of Limbs.  It's like they copied two of their unique sounds over the years and smashed them together as two different albums in one.  I'm hoping it opens up to me but I'm running out of will to keep listening to an album that seems devoid of cohesiveness.

B0016MJ6T2|1.0|Being a casual fan of the club-scene and having read the excellent book \\"Clubland\\" - based on the same story - I had high expectations that this movie was going to take us into the club world and give a real glimpse of what was going on.  Unfortunately, the movie is a campy re-telling of a truly horrific story about one Michael Alig.  I got the sense that the director was trying to create something that was arty and stylized, where the subject matter really demanded a more down-to-earth and uncolored treatment.  Not much point in a movie like this - neither interesting nor fun.  I recommend those who want an inside look at the life get a copy of \\"Clubland\\" instead, which also has more information about the Miami crime scene behind the clubs there as well.

B004J4WQ46|4.0|I loved the first two albums, found the third interesting and at times great, but ultimately don't return to it as often as the others.  I snatched up Angles pronto, and am so pleased I did.  The Strokes are the Strokes.  They sound like no one else although some others may sound like them.  Their sound evolves, and that is a good thing.  I don't need another \\"Is This It?\\"--I have that record.  Apparently, what I do need is \\"Angles\\" because I'm playing it non-stop.  Rockin out to Macchu Picchu.  Nodding off to sleep to Life is Simple.  Humming the whole thing.  Really enjoyable.  This Strokes album won't save your soul, but it will give you a darn good time.  More, please.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Two years since the U.S. release of Evangelion 1.11 and now we finally have the release of Evangelion 2.22. For those who don't know yet, this movie is the 2nd of 4 movies making the Tetralogy of \\"Rebuild of Evangelion\\". This movie is a basically a retelling of episodes 7-19 from the original series but instead of minor changes like in the first movie, this movie is a COMPLETE retelling of the series episodes ultimately heading towards a brand new direction in the story. All the scenes in this movie are not replicated from the original series but rather inspired from the TV show. Major changes in the story include a new pilot named Mari from the Euro branch of nerv. While some Angels return, most are completely disbanded and replaced with a few new ones. This movie runs for about 2 hours and I have to say that this is one of the most beautiful Anime's I have ever seen, I cannot imagine what the last 2 movies will be like.<br /><br />Like I have mentioned before, this movie is a retelling of the series. Familiar scenes from the original series are present and fans of the Eva series will notice them right away, however severely changed in both tone and outcome of each situation. For example the scene where Asuka and Shinji are in bed together was originally Asuka sleep walking and accidently ends up in his bed, but in this movie Asuka voluntarily goes to Shinji and has a little pep talk with him, those little differences can drastically change the meaning and perception of the scene. The Major thing I noticed in this movie that differs from the series is the interactions between characters; in my opinion all the characters in the movie get along rather well, especially the relationship between Asuka and Shinji. All characters seem less insane and more focused, I actually prefer this change of pace and I'm actually loving the chracters more now. However, all characters still act basically the same, Shinji is still the shy one, Rei is still the secrative one, Asuka is still the same outgoing showoff (but actually less bitchy). Misato is actually the one that has changed the most, she is a much stronger character in the movie adaption and less confused probably because she no longer has a love interest in Kaji. The movie's progression is a bit fast pace but doesn't feel rushed at all, and that is a very good thing because while only a 2 hour movie, they have managed to cram everything perfectly. I am not going to spoil anything about the plot of the movie but I will say that I cannot wait till te next movie. Although this movie still has its dark and emotional side that made this series infamous, there is a great deal of comic releif that I absolutely love.<br /><br />NOW for the DVD itself. The important aspect of this release for me was the English Dub and how they have executed it. The one thing that dissapointed me with the release of Evangelion 1.11 was the English dub; I was pretty satisfied with it actually, however I could not overlook the laziness of some of the voice actors most specifically the actors for Shinji (Spike Spencer) and Misato (Allison Keith). These are the veteran actors from the original dub released by ADV films and while as a fan I am greatful that these 2 reprised their roles however in the last movie they seemed a bit uninspired, but I can't blame them since its been a while since these guys voiced these characters. BUT I am glad to say that in this movie Allison Keith and Spike Spencer have finally found their way back to the hearts of the characters and it feels at home again. Tiffany Grant has also reprised her role as Asuka and I'm finding the same problems with her as well but she is still as fiesty as ever and its just nice to hear her voice again, I can't imagine anybody else doing Asuka. This DVD has a more extras than the last release and that is a MAJOR improvement because Evangelion 1.11 had no extras whatsoever and I am a little confused on why they released it as a 2 disc in the first place. The packaging of this DVD is a bit different than the last relase as well, this DVD comes with a Slip through cover and the texture of the orange cover is pretty cool. The DVD comes with a 20 page booklet (similar to the last DVD) and if you ask me, thats where the real extras lie. The purchase of the DVD is well worth the 20 page booklet that comes with it. I am also glad that there is audio commentary available as well, the director interviews the major cast of the film and their perspectives of the new movies and the creative process behind the dubbing. The only complaint I have is that the 2nd disc (ONCE AGAIN) lacks any real extras that provide true insight behind the movie, but at least the commentary is a bit more informative but I just wished they talked more about he film itself and less about themselves .Evangelion 2.22 is well worth the purchase, it is one of the most technically outstanding animes I have ever witnessed so far and everybody should see it.of this DVD is a bit different than the last relase as well, this DVD comes with a Slip through cover and the texture of the orange cover is pretty cool.

B000F8O35U|5.0|This is by far my favorite Disney movie and it was awesome to find it here at a reasonable price.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Very good cooler.  I added this to a E6600 dual core and it keeps it at 52C and below under full load for extended times.  I have the processor overclocked at 130%.  On the previous cooler that was very similar to the standard dual core cooler the chip was running at a maximum of 64C.  This cooler allowed me to increase the overclock as far as the motherboard would allow and will keep the chip cool for a much longer life.  Every 10C cuts your chip life in half.    The main pointers are to look at the videos for installation and be sure to tighten the screws but do not crank them down.  The instructions show to put the thermal compound in the middle of the cooler, but instead it should be little lines on the heat pipes to get the best coverage. You can find videos and images to support this version of thermal compound application with proof it is better.

B00003CWL6|1.0|FOR: As art, American Beauty helps us to re-examine the meaning of our lives by giving us a glimpse of very delicate, important things that reside at the periphery of consiousness.    AGAINST: The movie depicts sin without condemning it. Like so many other films of its kind, it depicts family life as full of loneliness and despair.    CONCLUSION: Art is inherently subversive. In an era of lawlessness and want, such as the Dark Ages, art attacks what lies at the heart of the savagery of existence in favor of order and hope. In our prosperous era, however, art subverts the institutions of civilization by prying them open and revealing unpleasant, hard truths. A century ago, with the likes of Ibsen and Shaw, one could have honestly supported the hope that we could face the hard truths and that all of it would somehow bear good fruit. Now, amid the moral and social wreckage that surrounds us, only a fool would.     Children are precious. Take a child with a character flaw and point out the truth about it to him. Do it over and over and see his spirit die. Families are also good and precious but they can take only so much hard truth. They must have a veneer of fantasy, if you will, to keep going. And while movies such as American Beauty may point out things that are hard to refute, their effect is to discredit good and needed institutions. This is an interesting film but a bad film -- bad for the family, bad for civilized life.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|If your a person who dissects films and finds holes in the plots and looks at every single scene judging every aspect. This is not for you. This is not a typical straight forward movie. This is a movie for those who use there imagination and look for movies as an escape from reality. There is nothing here that resembles reality and that is why I love this film. It has every aspect of action thrown in to this film. It has war scenes, evil samarai, dragons, and anything else you could dream of. This is an awsome film and it has a terrific meaning to the film. I wont ruin the film by getting into detail. I will tell you if you love Quentin Tarantino films or Tim Burton. This is a mix between the two. This film is like nothing I have ever seen and I personally loved the none stop action and the beautiful girls. It kind of reminded me of some asian films like \\"Machine gun girl\\",or \\"Blood The last Vampire\\". If you love films with beautiful woman kicking A** and a ton of action this is for you. If your going to dissect the film and look for flaws then you will find thousands of flaws. This film is for those who want to escape the horrors of the real world and enjoy a good action film.
B003Y5H542|5.0|When the Lizard with no name strode into the dry town of Dirt, it would change both of them forever! Dirt: a backwater, no-water, lawless outpost of the old west, and Rango: a terrarium bred chameleon with thespian ambitions. When Rango's fast mouth gets the better of him he finds you can't just talk your way into being a hero.<br /><br />And...<br /><br />Rango is an adult Western. Doesn't matter about the sumptuously animated characters or the beautifully realised backgrounds what we have here, pure and simple, is Shane, the Dollars Westerns of Sergio Leone and any number of generic archetypes you care to name (The Three Amigos also comes to mind!) As such i'm a little confused as to who the target audience for Rango is. There is nothing cute here to sell to the kiddies - no cuddly toys or lunch boxes to promote, far too many adults also still think animation is somehow sub-par film making and it will pass them by, it hasn't been advertised much as a Western so fans there are likely to miss out. Which leaves only rabid Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski fans (connoisseurs!) and that's a great shame as Rango is a brilliant movie aimed far more at an adult and Western fans audience than at the child/teen market.<br /><br />All the best bits go completely over the heads of the younger audience. The whole Western pastiche will be unfamiliar to many: extreme, frame filling close ups, dirty saloons, fast talking, mariachi music, swearing and death! The 'Spirit of the West' left nearly all the adults in the theatre spitting popcorn ad laughing. The earlier \\"Fear and Loathing\\" skit cracked up another significant proportion of the adult audience leaving the kids scratching their heads. Bill Nighy steals every scene turning in an Oscar worthy performance as the genuinely scary (scary as in: will give children nightmares scary) Rattlesnake Jake: \\"Go to hell!\\" \\"Where d'you think i come from?\\" Ned Beatty adds considerable menace as the mayor and even the overall characterisation and design errs more on the side of harsh reality than fluffy fancyisms.<br /><br />The overarching theme of a town of animals in the Nevada desert, bled dry of water by the march of 'progress', will also pass many by; but may also plant a few seeds ;)<br /><br />The film does have plenty to satisfy older children too. But for once it is these bits that feel like they have been shoe-horned into an adult movie, rather than vice versa. As such Rango falls between two stools being neither dramatic nor intelligent enough to be a genuine adult pastiche, nor foolishly funny or endearing enough to satisfy children. However the good bits are genius and the bad bits merely 'just' entertaining which gives Rango real 5-star appeal!he side of harsh reality than fluffy fancyisms.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Ever since I discovered Porcupine Tree through Facebook comments on an unsigned band (life is weird!), this album, title to cover to concept, interested me. I have no idea what it was, but there was definitely something calling me about Deadwing. I couldn't find it anywhere, stores in Alaska suck for music, and my desire to finally hear this apparently genius band was growing within me. Eventually, I found a friend who had Fear of a Blank Planet, but that is a story for another day. After months of searching, I finally caved in and got it as an MP3 from somewhere, I can't really recall where. I was immediately amazed. This album is a much more rock filled effort than FoaBP, which is a bit of a cross between techno and metal. The main difference, though, is that the music is so incredibly complicated, most people will just think that it's just a rock record, and then...Boom, they realize there's 10,000 layers of ambience and acoustic guitars and pianos and background vocals, produced to utter perfection (other than minor clipping on the regular CD) and delivered with increasingly interesting lyrics. There is a reason why Alex Lifeson contributed a guitar solo to their next album after this one, you know. Just buy it, otherwise, you'll live through life never quite satisfied with music.

Thing album is a head of it's time, it blow the lid off of pop music which was getting a little to Gaga for a while there. It is nice to hear a new sound on the radio. The album is pure dance, pure pop and pure mood. Its what you listen before you go out for the night. Its great, listen to it more then once before deciding to call it bad, disapointing etc. It will get inside of you and make you move. If you were expecting amazing vocality, deep lyrics and tear move on. That is not Britney, it never will be. She has an amazing voice that she is choosing to have fun with not sing like Whitney or whoever. If you call this album bad  you are an idiot. Dance your ass off Britney fans this album rocks. It is light hearted, easy listening, dance music that does just that: GETS YOU MOVIN!  Also Inside out parallels Baby one more time. It is epic, it will take the world by storm.

It started out with three young people wanting to go for a ski down the hill, but not such a good idea to do it after hours or when everyone is going home and getting off for the evening, better yet the ski lift was going to be closed for a week.  so what would you do, if you got stuck on the ski lift?

B004A8ZWSS|2.0|Some may applaud Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's efforts to direct a film which ushers the viewer to a more sophisticated era of filmmaking.  A time with Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, and Grace Kelly.  Ultimately, however, the boring dialogue, the predictable ending, the mediocre performance from the two leads, and the jumbled direction/screenplay - is this a thriller, a romance, or a comedy? - turned this into a messy James Bond imitation, with nowhere near the suspense or seductiveness.  There is neither legitimate espionage misdirection nor substantive comedy.<br /><br />French police are in cooperation with various agencies on the trail of the beautiful Elise Ward (Jolie).  They conspicuously follow her from her home to a local coffee shop where she appears to be dressed for a ball and boringly orders the exact same item in the exact same chair as she always does.  The chase begins after a mysterious note from someone named Alexander Pearce gets hand-delivered to a perpetually blas&eacute; Elise.  Apparently the snobbish attitude leached aboard the British accent.  Aboard a train she soon meets American math teacher Frank Tupelo (Depp), who proceeds to legitimately bore everyone within a 3-mile radius for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The cast roll-call is outstanding, but it says something that nobody could outshine either of the disappointing leads.  Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton play Police Inspectors, the former because he needs the roles and the latter because of subtle one-upmanship.  Steven Berkoff is [insert name of generic bland guy].  Rufus Sewell is namelessly and insignificantly inserted.  Weighed, measured, and found wanting.<br /><br />So what could possibly be left?  Unlike the movies it portends to imitate, The Tourist is nothing more than the films from which it wishes to separate: CGI and visually dominated films bereft of realistic plot or competent dialogue.  This film is nothing more than beautiful landscapes and the looks of its two stars.  In that regard, Depp often looks disheveled and uninteresting, and Jolie, despite the fact that she's dolled up from into to credits, is not nearly as interesting as all the other characters seem to think she is.<br /><br />This film serves as nothing more than a Venice tourism promotion and for Angelina Jolie's Google image search hit count.<br /><br />Jason Elinoften looks disheveled and uninteresting, and Jolie, despite the fact that she's dolled up from into to credits, is not nearly as interesting as all the other characters seem to think she is.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|This is one of my top favorite movies. Jaden Smith is a gifted actor and all the characters are well cast. Jackie Chan makes a superb \\"Mr. Myagi\\" as Mr. Han, but also gives a lot of validity to the film as a martial arts movie. Great story, realistic characters, amazing fighting choreography. Very high re-watch value as well.
0756404738|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, and I will admit that I was worried about a sophomore dropoff in the 2nd book.  I just wasn't sure the 2nd book could match the quantifiable levels of awesome contained in Name Of The Wind.<br /><br />I was dead wrong.  Wise Man's Fear is every bit as good as Name Of The Wind, and probably more.  I'm not going to attempt to summarize as I feel this would do the story a great disservice.<br /><br />Just go read it, then come back and praise me as your literary Moses who led you to the promised land.  I don't ask for much, I'm a humble man.<br /><br />Epic book, epic storytelling (these are not the same thing), and the story has a musical soul to it.  The story and well written characters you grow to love.  I can't recommend this series, this book, and this author enough.  You owe it to yourself to escape into these wonderful books.

1591843790|4.0|When I first opened Guy Kawasaki's latest book, Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions, I thought I knew what I was getting: a great marketing book that outlined terrific strategies for winning people to your product or service.    I was disappointed. At first.    Early in the first chapter, Guy shattered my expectations: \\"When you enchant people, your goal is not to make money from them or to get them to do what you want, but to fill them with great delight.\\" It took me several chapters more to realize that what he was giving me was better than another how-to book--it was a who-to-be book.    Enchantment isn't about marketing, or even about winning friends and influencing people. It's about delighting them. And delighting someone isn't about strategy, it's about philosophy (although his chapters on technology are a bit more practical and hands-on).    Frankly, before reading the book I was worried that Enchantment was going to be all about how to get people to fulfill your agenda, but early on Guy writes that enchantment is \\"the process of delighting people with a product, service, organization, or idea. The outcome of enchantment is voluntary and long-lasting support that is mutually beneficial.\\" It's more about wooing your bride than it is about making a sale. And that won me over--yes, I was enchanted.

The very end--when the three casts got together to sing was superb.  Colm Wilkinson, when he started to sing \\"Bring Him Home\\" gave me chills...he sounds exactly the same as on my ancient Les Mis cd.  Alfie Boe was superb--the whole case was superb!  This is a must-have, well worth the money spent!
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I listen to a huge variety of music.  From David Allan Coe to Eminem, Thelonious Monk to Slayer.  That being said I find myself listening to this album more then any other.  A great album is judged not a couple good songs but by the ability to listen to the album from beginning to end without skipping a track.  I start this album at the beginning and let it play through at least 6 times a week.  This is easily the best country music album of 2010.  And possibly the best album of the year, though Eminem's Recovery is pretty darn good.<br />Bottom line: buy this album, you will love it!
B0009GV9LO|5.0|This performance is my baptism of opera video. I came across a second hand VHS copy in Glasgow's Barrowland Market years ago and paid one pound for it. My knowledge in opera was non-exsistence at the time. All I knew at the time was the soprano has an English sounding name Morton. Over the year, the tape worn out but memory of the performance has deeply ingrained in my mind. The singing was lascious. I can visually recall the blue dress of Tosca, the scene inside the church when Cavaradossi sing recondita armonia and the duet Mario, Mario. I have been searching for this one for many years. As soon as I found it is available on DVD, I placed an order for it. I am looking foreward to renew the happy memores.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|I just wanted to add a note about the mixes. This is strictly speaking a remixed and remastered release. While these mixers were done to sound like the original mixes, as a purist, I have to point out that these are not the original mixes. I don't mind the creation of new mixes, in fact I rather like many of the new mixes created for the Yellow Submarine soundtrack. And these mixes sound pretty good and really similar to the originals.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|There are two general types of people who care enough about Britney's albums to comment on them:<br /><br />1. The music snobs who have never been to a club in their lives, and who think fashion is an extra large pocket protector (these people are usually scared of relationships, read \\"The New York Times\\", and go to film festivals); you know, the Kids in the Hall Daryl types who want to rock to REM and an oompah band playing Mozart while they sip tea because they are threatened by sensual music. Oh, they'll listen to Katy Perry because she is young enough to not be threatening to them, and also ... her music is about as interesting as a mocha at Starbucks.<br /><br />These are the people, 99 percent of the time men, who liked Britney when she sang \\"Oops! ... I Did it Again!\\" and \\"Baby One More Time\\" in the schoolgirl outfits, and often refer to how good of an artist she was in those days. Hmmmm ... feeling threatened by strong, grown-up women much?<br /><br />These people often make snarky comments about Britney \\"not being able to dance\\" (while they trip over their own two feet in their boat shoes on the way to the farmer's market; would LOVE to see them try to do her choreography -- I have -- it's hard), and also like to say \\"she can't sing\\" (obviously they have never listened to \\"My Baby\\" from \\"Circus\\").<br /><br />Finally, they complain about the \\"autotune\\" on her vocals, which has me scratching my head; last time I checked there is no one mix effect called \\"autotune\\" and, since it is 2011 and not 1991, techno is the word of the day. I don't want to listen to an acoustic set of \\"The Shadows of Your Smile\\"; I prefer to be treated to modern music, with modern effects, when a new album comes out in the year 2011.<br /><br />2. ... and then there are the true fans, the people who have loved Britney through thick and thin, and who know how to appreciate something different, something bold, something eccentric, something confident, something ... Britney.<br /><br />This album rocks. Britney could have gone the safe route like so many other artists when they hit a certain age and put together an \\"indie rock\\", country, or slow jam album because it was the easy way out. Nope. She did not let herself or her fans down ... she is as in-your-face, ballastic, epic, theatrical, and sarcastically funny as ever on this album. She also had the guts to get up on stage last weekend and perform songs from this album; not an easy thing to do with so many armchair critics in this world who could not get on a stage and perform, much less pour the potato chips out of the bag on the commercial break without getting out of breath.<br /><br />Thank God for Britney. Her albums always put a smile on my face and fill me with energy -- they put me in a good mood in this crazy world ... which is more than I can say for listening to an acoustic set of \\"The Shadows of Your Smile\\" with Daryl in the tea shop on the way to the film festival.afe route like so many other artists when they hit a certain age and put together an \\"indie rock\\", country, or slow jam album because it was the easy way out.

0316044695|4.0|Lone Survivor is the story of four Navy SEALs who fought against a force of as many as 150 Taliban and the one SEAL who made it out alive. Marcus Luttrell's story is gripping and terrifying. As I read I could see how the scenes could translate well to the big screen, which at the time of this post is categorized as in development by IMDB (to be released sometime in 2011).<br /><br />I expected the book to be a detailed account of that one event, Operation Redwing. Actually, there is quite a bit of time spent on telling the story of how Marcus Luttrell became a Navy SEAL. For those who are already well-versed in the elite Navy Special Forces training, this section can seem to drag on in parts. However, the parts before he got to SEAL training were quite interesting. Scenes of former United States Army soldier Billy Shelton training Marcus were inspirational and brought context to the SEAL training scenes.<br /><br />Once the story transitions to Afghanistan, the story really picks up speed. The mission is set up with great detail and context by sharing background information on the Afghan people, the Taliban, and tribal system. Without this information, I would have found myself lost with the Pashto language. Marcus Luttrell and contributing author Patrick Robinson did a fine job giving the reader access to language and customs unknown to someone who hasn't served overseas.<br /><br />The firefight on the mountain was hard for me to visualize, so I looked up pictures of the Hindu Kush mountains. I can't imagine dealing with what Marcus Luttrell's SEAL team dealt with on that mountain. It's truly something you have to read and see for yourself to fully understand.<br /><br />The writing was in the voice of Marcus Luttrell, and I assume heavily edited for information that is still classified. Since it was first person and in his voice, it contained a lot of vernacular, some stream-of-consciousness, and the occasional tangent. The story, although dragging for me in a couple spots, was overwhelmingly interesting and captivating. I can't wait to see this on the big screen.<br /><br />Bookophile Rating: 89%nteresting and captivating. I can't wait to see this on the big screen.    Bookophile Rating: 89%
B002SAS26E|5.0|I had heard buzz around the Internet about Jaipur being a great trading game, but I wasn't sure about it, mostly because the pricetag was $25, the box was small, and the components, as far as I could gather, were a deck of cards (granted, beautifully illustrated cards) and a few stacks of pogs. But I decided it was worth a try, and I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />Jaipur is a game of trading for two players that is played over three rounds. The winner of each round receives a \\"seal of excellence,\\" and the player who secures two seals of excellence becomes the Maharaja's personal trader, thus winning the game.<br /><br />The game starts with three camels being placed in the center of the table in a row, a hand of five cards dealt to each player, and two random cards turned face up to complete the five-card center row (the market). The cards depict either goods or camels. The pogs, which correspond to the goods cards and are divided into expensive goods (diamonds, gold, and silver) and regular goods (cloth, spice, and leather) are organized in descending order by value off to the side. There are also bonus tiles for three-, four-, or five-card trades, which are shuffled and placed off to the side. Players remove any camels from their hands and place these cards in front of them.<br /><br />On a turn, players may do only one of two actions: \\"buy\\" cards (take cards from the market) or \\"sell\\" cards (discard cards for pogs). This is such a simple concept, but the way this is done is clever. Here are options for buying cards. A player may:<br /><br />take one face-up good<br />take all the camels<br />take two or more goods, replacing them with cards from his hand and/or camels<br /><br />Players may also sell goods, one type per turn, discarding cards from their hand and taking an equal number of pogs from that good's pile. If three, four, or five goods are discarded in this way, players also take a corresponding bonus pog. (For example, if five cloth are discarded, a player would take the top five cloth pogs and the top bonus pog on the five pile.) Each pog has a point value on it, and the combined point value of all the pogs players acquire in a round will determine who receives the seal of excellence for that round.<br /><br />That's the basic concept, but here's where it gets tricky (and deceptively clever). Your hand size can never exceed seven cards, but camels don't count against your hand size. Taking one card from the market is the slowest way to build up your hand, but it also limits the new cards your opponent will get to choose from (as only one card from the deck will replace it). Taking all the camels is a good move sometimes, as it gives you more to work with (camels don't count against your hand size, but they can be exchanged when you want to take more than one card from the market), but taking all the camels also opens up the market for your opponent (taking three camels, for example, gives your opponent three new goods to choose from on his turn). Exchanging goods is a great way to get what's best in the market, but you have to get rid of cards in your hand or camels, which your opponent can then take. Each buying option is a trade-off.<br /><br />Each selling option also has its set of challenging decisions. I mentioned before that pogs are organized in descending order by value. This means that the most valuable pogs of each good go to the player who sells first. But players get a hefty bonus if they sell three, four, or especially five goods at a time. Should a player wait to trade in more goods, or should he sell early to get the top pogs? The expensive goods (diamonds, gold, and silver) are worth the most points per good, but they also must be sold in sets of at least two (all other goods can be sold one at a time). And the pogs are shorted: there aren't as many pogs representing goods as there are cards of that good in the deck. So if you wait too long to sell, you could be out of luck.<br /><br />Theround is over whenever three piles of pogs are emptied. Whoever has the most camels receives a five-point bonus and points are calculated to determine who receives the seal of excellence.<br /><br />Jaipur is a fantastic game. A trading game for two players seems like a lame idea, but it is surprisingly excellent in Jaipur. Players don't trade among themselves (a la Settlers of Catan), but the interaction with the market really does make it seem like you're trading with the other player. I like that every decision made in this game has consequences for both players, so it's highly interactive. And it's not a game where one player can really run away with it (at least if the other player is careful) because it is so well balanced.<br /><br />I also like it because it is so variable. At the beginning of a round, I might start with a hand of three leather, making me think I should collect leather. But when gold or diamonds show up, I have to rethink my strategy on the fly. I could exchange those leather in my hand for gold (which are worth more), but in doing so I would give my opponent the chance to take my leather. I like this constant reevaluation. It keeps the game interesting.<br /><br />Overall, Jaipur is a blast to play. And it's so simple (that doesn't mean \\"easy\\"). I read and understood the rules after one pass through the rulebook (about seven minutes), taught it to my wife in about five minutes, and it takes about twenty minutes to play a full, three-round game (though sometimes a game ends after two rounds, like when my wife smokes me). It is fast-paced, and because there is only one decision per turn (buy or sell?), I don't anticipate \\"analysis paralysis\\" setting in for even the most overconscious players. And the game gets deeper the more we play. At first we played conservatively, trying to collect sets. Now we play much more aggressively, which makes the game fun and also more interactive.<br /><br />The downside of Jaipur? You're paying $25 for cards and pogs. Still, I think the $25 pricetag is worth the amount of fun contained in the game, especially for people who have trouble finding two-player games. Another downside is that Jaipur is a two-player game exclusively. This is great because many two-player games are variants of larger games, few are specifically built for it, but it also limits the chances you'll get to play it in larger settings.<br /><br />I can't recommend this game more highly. The artwork, components, and theme are great, but the gameplay is phenomenal.

0767817478|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />If only the creature had only been named something else and not promoted as the \\"Godzilla successor\\", the movie would have done much better.<br /><br />I saw the movie in a theater almost as soon as it came out in 1998 and I own a VHS copy. It's been about thirteen (13) years since I've seen \\"Godzilla [1998]\\" (hereafter G98), but I generally have favorable memories of it. G98 is no masterpiece; it has its flaws, but it is far from being an abomination. The movie's major strength and flaw simultaneously is Pseudo-Godzilla himself (or is it herself - oh, the androgyny!). As a mythic force of nature, the creature falls short; it is vulnerable to heavier artillery, it is not mindlessly destructive, and it is willing to stoop to Tatopoulos's (Matthew Broderick's) level, like a man wishing to communicate with an ant. As a super-beast, Pseudo-Godzilla is more impressive; it is extremely powerful, fast, agile, clever, and tenacious in self-defence and of its raptor-like brood. Perhaps G98 was not quite the blockbuster audiences anticipated because Pseudo-Godzilla was cast as a plausible animal with plausible animal behaviors, instead of an unstoppable, supernatural legend.  Nevertheless, when Pseudo-Godzilla is striding across New York, you feel a tingle of awe; he's so colossal all you see are his muscular legs trampling across the street.<br /><br />However, this Pseudo-Godzilla seems to be agoraphobic; he prefers to burrow and live in subterranean passages (even though, as an irradiated iguana, it's not really built for digging). Instead of terrorizing the world, all this titan wants to do is eat fish (again, not part of a herbivorous iguana's diet) and raise its young. Like a zookeeper using a steak to rouse a sleeping lion so that the visitors get their money's worth, Tatopoulos and the military build fish mounds to lure the lizard to the surface. Physically overwhelming as it is, Pseudo-Godzilla is essentially only a simple creature that is monstrous only by accident.<br /><br />Therefore, to get the most out of this guilty pleasure of a movie, pretend that the creature is not Godzilla, but instead, say, the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, with whom it has many parallels and similarities. Then one can appreciate G98's thrilling set-pieces more thoroughly. Also, to compensate for Pseudo-Godzilla's relatively short screen time, gloss over the bland dialogue the human cast utters, block out any comparisons to \\"Jurassic Park\\" to better enjoy the infant Godzilla sequence, and appreciate Tatopoulos's cleverness in leading Pseudo-Godzilla to his doom on the Brooklyn Bridge. I am aware this involves switching off part of your brain, but again G98 was always intended as a roller coaster sensation machine, which it succeeds in being to some degree. The movie is certainly more engaging than the outlandishly dubbed Toho schlockfests of the last four decades or so.<br /><br />In conclusion, to paraphrase a former acquaintance who saw G98 in the theater with me, it's not Godzilla, but it's fairly good.monstrous only by accident.

B004TP6O8O|5.0|Great album!!! I was surprised with the album big time. I was expecting Wiz to sell out, however this album does have a mixtape feel to it. Stand out tracks on this album for me are when im gone, no sleep, fly solo, wake up. This a must for hip-hop fans
0060531053|5.0|I am a beginning homebrewer. In order that I might soak up all that Papazian has to say, I am slowly working my way through it. This has been an excellent read that is incredibly informative. For those of us that are new to the game, this will serve as a constant reference material, not just a one-time read.    I appreciate Mr. Papazian's love for the craft and his desire to see others develop that same love through brewing. I would highly recommend this text.
1401917186|4.0|I'm not in love with all things Doreen Virtue, but this book was quite good, actually.  If you're interested in Earth Spirits and determining which, if any, realm your spirit may have originated from, I highly recommend this book.  Great information, and it's concise and well-organized. A quick read, you could probably read the entire book in a matter of hours if you really wanted to.

B004SDSSFY|4.0|I have to change my rating from 1 star to 4 star. I do like it and it does what it's supposed to.   Read below for my story. I caution you. If you try this program out from any other source than Amazon than the Amazon Key won't work.    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  This program is a nightmare. I downloaded it first from the Android MarketPlace.  Than when I saw it was working I bought the Amazon unlock.    The program won't accept Amazon. To make matters worse. It is the first application ever that is  uninstallable.    I downloaded more than 4 different application erasers. This program won't allow itself to be erased from  the phone. I figured I'd erase it and than reinstall the Amazon version. Not happening.    This is the first application ever that I've run across that is so invasive that it won't allow itself to be uninstalled  not even using it's own uninstaller.    Now I have to spend an hour with Amazon to get a refund.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Amazon customer service was great, you do have to call but they switch you right through to the Android Apps specialist. They gave me a no hassle refund. Than I went directly to  the manufacturers site and bought the program.    It installed and works fine. Since this is a rating of the program I'll give it a 4 but \\"Danger Will Robinson\\" you have to buy this program from Amazon you can't use a demo from  anywhere else.
B004NSULHM|3.0|Okay first I am by no means a music critic. Just your average music fan. So I just finished listening to The King of Limbs. And to be honest....I just felt underwhelmed. The first four tracks to me sounded like b-sides from \\"the Eraser\\". Things pick up for the better slightly on the last four songs. This album really needed \\"These are my twisted words\\" to be on it, even though it was previously released as a download only single by the band. It would have added so much to the album. I am shocked that there are some people giving this five stars. But to each their own I suppose. I would only give Ok Computer and maybe In Rainbows 5 stars (to me giving an album 5 stars is saying it's an all time classic). I would give Kid A and Amnesiac 4 stars. I just can't say this is as good as OK Computer or In Rainbows. I think 3 stars is fair. It almost pains me in some sense to give it only three. I have been a huge fan since 1997. I felt fortunate to have seen them live in Tampa during the In Rainbows tour. Lets be honest, In Rainbows was a great, great album. So you are going to have unrealistic expectations for a follow up, which I might be guilty of. It has been suggested all over the web that a follow up record is coming soon. Let's hope so.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was well written and a great read!  I am glad that I read it and am looking forward to the next book!!
B002UXRGLG|4.0|I thought that this series, while quite good, was not up to the same standard of excellence set by the original \\"Planet Earth\\" series.  Our whole family enjoyed watching them, to be sure, but we weren't blown away quite so thoroughly as we were by \\"Planet Earth\\".  Maybe it is just the fact that the original series was, well, \\"original\\".  At any rate, I'm certainly glad that I bought these \\"Attenborough\\" discs from Amazon, rather than settling for the \\"Oprah\\" version that was available at a local store.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|First, I must be a slow reader because it took me a lot longer than 2 hours to finish this book, but was able to complete it in about 4 days. It amazes me how people can read so quickly!<br /><br />I went into this book having no idea what it was about. I had heard the title many times, so thought I would try it out. To my surprise, there was a Grim Reaper pondering his job and various different lives of people he had \\"carried\\" away into eternity. He didn't seem to like his job very much and was amused by our depiction of him - skull face, Scythe, etc. Apparently, he looks human. He says at one point that if we want to know what he's like we should take a look in a mirror. Personally, I enjoyed the musings of the grim reaper more than the rest of the story.<br /><br />He is very interested in telling us the story of a German girl (during Hitler's regime) he came across a few times before he finally took her soul away may years later when she was older. It is not a happy story. Her brother dies, her mother has to hand her off to foster parents, her foster parents help harbor a Jewish man in their basement afraid they will be caught, the whole town is bombed and her best friend and foster parents die and so on. I agree the circumstances of the bombing are not clear. We don't know too much about what happened there - just that it's part of the whole Nazi control tragedy.<br /><br />The girl likes to take books that represent important milestones in her life. Germans at the time were asked to burn certain books, and she liked to keep them and read with her foster father. She also developed a special relationship with the man staying in her basement, and after he was captured she reunited with him years later.He made a nice illustrated book for her that is depicted in the Kindle version. I did not find it hard to read, as others have mentioned. I was able to read the illustrations just fine.<br /><br />The girl wrote her own book, which was saved by the Grim Reaper during the bombing scene. When he meets her again when it's time to take her soul - he tells her he has the book and lets her take a look at it. I liked that scene a lot. Shows the grim reaper as more of a sensitive creature.<br /><br />I admit I started getting bored with the book about half way through and skipped a large chunk in the middle, so I might have missed some important plot elements. I think I got a good idea of what the story was about. There was even a nice reference to the Jessie Owens incident.<br /><br />Not the best book I have ever read, but not the worst either.<br /><br />As I said, it is a sad tale, but having the grim reaper narrate it was brilliant.ts her again when it's time to take her soul - he tells her he has the book and lets her take a look at it.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have become addicted to BBC dramas because they always deliver quality entertainment and I get to see real actors and not these surgically enhanced nitwits who so many of today's filmgoers love and admire.    This four part adaption of an Elizabeth Gaskell novel stars Richard Armitage as John Thornton and from the moment this man shows up on screen you are mesmerized with his character, who starts out very austere and cold, yet as the story progresses he changes and it is amazing to watch the transformation. The heroine Margaret Hale lives a quiet idyllic life in the Southern part of England until one day her father who is a minister decides to uproot Margaret and her mother and their servant to the industrial Northern part of England to settle some internal anguish he is dealing with regarding his faith. The mother and servant can not acclimate to the gritty and impoverished village where the main employer is John Thornton and his mother who run the cotton mill. Sinead Cusack is brilliant as the no-nonsense mother who loves and supports her son yet barely tolerates her frivolous daughter. The initial meeting between John and Margaret is during a beatdown where he is shown thrashing an employee for smoking in the cotton mill which was apparently quite a dangerous thing back then. The next several interactions between them only create a further wedge and it seems that they will never agree on anything much less connect as a couple. Yet the story moves onward and ends with a chance encounter that changes everything.
B004SBX112|5.0|I was skeptical about this as well when I saw it listed as the free app of the day until I read the reviews and realized that this was in fact the ad free version that was being offered... NO MORE ADS! and it replaced my old version, not added another... Such an awesome job way to go Amazon!
1594484775|3.0|Not the author's best work but still an enjoyable read that kept me occupied on my train commute. The point I got out of this book was that one should let aging rock stars burn out and remain great to their fans rather than let them down by revealing that they too get old and have adult annoying problems.<br />Unlike Hornby's earlier works I didn't find myself relating to anybody in this book which can be both good and bad but in this case it was whatever.<br />If you like Mr. Hornby's work, read this. If you don't like his literature avoid this. If you haven't read any of his books this isn't a good place to start.
B004SBX112|1.0|nice, put up apps that are free on android market and call it a free daily paid app on amazon...fail. omg cry for 25 words.
030746363X|4.0|This book is very very exciting, I'm loving everything that Tim has to put forth into the world. He has a ton of creative ideas to put forth. I think he's a nice guy. I look forward to him making other books on almost anything.    To the book. Haven't read everything in the book but the most important to me so far. The collection of ideas is a very good ones. Most books are all about the perfect diet, or gaining the most amount of muscle etc... Minimal effective dosage and pareto principle applied to diet and exercise, I'M IN!!!! For some time for me diet/exercise has been exaclty about this what the most cost effective investment I can put into my body.    I'm a bit closer to my ideal thanks to mr.Ferris. I know more about binging for health. I take photos with my phone of my meals and am unable to lie to myself. I don't spend too much time in the kitchen. I hit the weights for two sessions a week and train at home.     I'm not at my all time best physically but it dosent matter, because, when I was at my all time best phyically I had to spend a lot of time, money and energy on food, training, gym, suplements...    Simplify your life.

B000ZELISO|5.0|Absolutely the best in the series so far!  the most beautiful film i have ever watched. Amazing direction and the most amazing cinematography on any movie in history i have seen. a few talked about points in the book such as  1) the mugggle world being terrorized by death eaters  2) the wizarding world being terrorized by death eaters  were brought to screen fantastically with the best film opener of the series and a eerie chase through the tall grass of the burrow  you will seriously be happy to have seen this and i will never forget it.  It was truly a beautiful translation from the book and one of the best films according to box office grossing (over 900,000,000)and critically ( 88% on rotten tomatoes)
B003K15IF8|5.0|My classics book club recently reviewed and rated the books we've read over the past five years.  Only Stoner recieved top ratings from all our members (Vanity Fair was second).  The stoicism of Stoner and his family rings a familiar and heartbreaking bell for those of us with roots in prairie farm communities.  It is a beautiful, sad read.  Enjoy.

B001QOGYBI|3.0|Cleverly crafted with some innovative images, FANTASTIC MR. FOX is certainly an original \\"animated\\" film.  But it seemed dull at times and \\"preachy\\" at others.<br />George Clooney was too much Clooney and Mr. Fox seemed an extension of his superstar persona rather than a real character.  Similarly, Meryl Streep's Mrs. Fox is bland and considering her undeniable talent, she's rather disappointing.  Wes Anderson's directing skills are evident, but the whole effect IMO is flat and not entirely satisfying.

B001CXWWBE|5.0|Well i got this Since Sept 2010 and so far i have no problems with it. I do a lot of large files transferring between PC in the house, and i get avg around 70 Mb/s speed between networked PC in the house. I don't usually write reviews but i just thought i should for this exceptional item. I didn't think it was Lifetime, but when i visited Intel for the drivers, i noticed that it comes w/ Limited Lifetime Warranty, awesome no? :). Anyway, i'm running Windows 7 x64 and it works flawlessly. Windows has drivers for it, i just needed the Intel drivers to do some other tweaks. Anyway, buy it and you won't regret its performance.

B002BFBAWO|4.0|Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart are appealing and fun in director Greg Mottola's semi-autobiographical \\"Adventureland\\", an enjoyable little tale about a young guy's summer job at a local amusement park.  Most people will be able to relate to this film... after all, haven't we all had that really crappy summer job where the only saving graces were the memorable people and after-work experiences that crossed our path because of the connections we made at the job?<br /><br />While the film goes down easy, I appreciated its emotional complexity.  In particular, there's a special effort in the film to keep the characters from being too predictable and one-note: Everyone seems to have good and less-than-good qualities, and act in both stable and not-so-stable ways.  For the most part, the characters use their particular strengths to help out other characters who don't have those same strengths.<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" is recommended to those who enjoy understated, indie-style dramas that aren't heavy on simple answers and broad set-pieces.  It's a nice little tale with a handful of funny moments that should satisfy most people looking for a thoughtful, entertaining evening of home viewing.  There's even a little romance.<br /><br />The movie looked and sounded fine on the standard DVD I watched, which also featured a small handful of interesting extras.

B004KSQN7C|2.0|Somewhere in the world, someone put enough faith in Britney to let her unleash another album onto a now-jaded and \\"bored with her sound\\" world.<br /><br />I feel bad for that this seems to be a almost half-hearted attempt to still stay relevant as that parade passed her by some years back.<br /><br />Still, on her train, the party hasn't ended, and she still has tried to move even closer to simply saying to whoever she's hot for to take her - literally.<br /><br />Well, I'm hoping to still listen objectively and try to base this album on it's own merit.<br /><br />Here it goes - 12 songs at just under an hour:<br /><br />01 - Till The World Ends - typical Britney - sexual innuendo everywhere, a girl is in the club and creates drama over a guy and waah waah waah hey DJ play something for me. (They're also \\"chopping\\" the notes on Brit's singing, a new cheap gadget to hide her weak singing.) The beat's okay, though...  6/10<br /><br />02 - Hold It Against Me - Man, I hear a sped-up version of Jennifer Lopez here from 2000, and that's REALLY sad. Her singing (once again) is pretty weak. BTW, the same beat was carried over from the previous song, too - yuk...  4/10<br /><br />03 - Inside Out - This track not too long ago got \\"leaked\\" by her handlers - I mean, 'AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE,' so you've probably heard it already - using the well-worn Madonna formula of stopping the song (and her trill vocals) at the very beginning to give it a skipped sound, and now stoles a few pages from Justin Timberlake's ballad-ish sound - I can almost hum \\"What Comes Around\\" during the chorus. Positively sad on all levels.  4/10.<br /><br />04 - I Wanna Go - This is the other recently \\"leaked\\" track -  cold, no feeling of warmth at all - and am I hearing whistling during the chorus??? Oh, and about the chorus - there's this little European song called \\"Dragostea Din Tei\\" by the boy band O-Zone? It also has a sound similar to \\"Numa Numa.\\" Yes, the viral song that got old even as you heard it on the radio over FIVE YEARS AGO. Well, it's back!!! Forget this ripoff of a song...  2/10<br /><br />05 - How I Roll - This has got to be one of the WORST songs on the album from someone who used to have a bit of talent... Here's my real problem with most of this album, to be honest. She can barely sing anymore and relies on studio trickery to barely get by, but she looks \\"pretty\\" (most of the time) and her producers build songs around that premise. This song is an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE throwaway. This is without a doubt one of the weakest tracks on the album... and when she barely \\"sings\\" about \\"riding out to her posse\\" I almost fell out of my chair in laughter.<br />Yes, I laugh at you, Britney. This song sucks.  0/10<br /><br />06 - (Drop Dead) Beautiful (feat. Sabi) - Well, we finally get one \\"leaked\\" song that isn't THAT bad. They're not using the chopped singing TOO MUCH here and after you push past the fake spontaneous laughter and the stupid Autotune some female rapper named \\"Sabi\\" raps some stuff and that doggone Autotune is EVERYWHERE!... and then mercifully, like pulling a horribly rotted tooth, it's over. Blah so-so work from someone who's been so out of touch with reality for a long time...  6/10<br /><br />07 - Seal It With A Kiss -  So far EVERY song has been about shamelessly hooking up with a stranger, but this song pretty much anchors it. She's horny as hell here, but of course she's using barely adult words to articulate her obvious attempt to pick up a guy. She's thinking 'Yeah, I see you in the club, I'm the one tossing you the dollar bills like the god stripper you look like and then we're leaving so I can have sex with YOU...' The musical gags are pretty obvious here as they're now using music sped up, music slowed down, and I'm pretty much bored. It's all been done before, and by better singers, honestly.  5/10<br /><br />08 - Big Fat Bass (feat. Will.I.Am) - this poor guy, is there no paycheck he'll turn down? The Black Eyed Peas can't be thatbroke... If he helped produce this, he slipping. It's boring, repetitive, and damn Britney's still pretty horny. Does she EVER leave the club, or is there club music playing EVERYWHERE she goes? \\"Bass\\" and \\"treble,\\" now she's using music terminology to talk about penises and vagina - wow, how 'inventive'. How 'cutting edge.' Yawn. And then Will throws in a few rapped lines in. Wow. The dry cliches are cracking under the heat as we speak. Snore...  6/10<br /><br />09 - Trouble For Me - I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BRITNEY IS ACTUALLY SINGING??? Well, she breathes through it for about 30 seconds. This song is club-kid 1997 fabulous, and this might have been good. Now she wants the guy to try and pick her up in the club for once? How original... yeah, whatever...  5/10<br /><br />10 - Trip To Your Heart - Be careful folks, here goes - I ACTUALLY LIKED THIS SONG! - vintage Britney 2002, vintage sound 2000, it's got this nice beat, this could have been her first REAL HIT off the album. Yes, she still wants to screw, but at least she's using her little tiny barely there squeaky voice and making it worth listening to... but WAIT A SECOND! In the chorus, I just heard shades of Shakira's \\"She Wolf\\" chorus in this song! Oops, Brit-Brit. Disqualified for plagurism...  4/10<br /><br />11 - Gasoline - Britney is 'burning' so bad in her \\"naughty place\\" she's using chemical combustibles to describe what \\"someone\\" can \\"give her.\\" The beat's okay, though. Keep it away from me, though, because it's simply another throwaway song from the hype machine of the Madonna Jr. - I mean, Britney...  4/10<br /><br />12 - Criminal - she's now 'singing' about every single guy she's been with since she crushed Justin's heart. Is that a flute I hear as well? I also liked this song too, because it's almost real-people normal. This might also become a hit for her, too.  7/10<br /><br />So, overall?

I'll light a candle for you.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading and please don't forget to comment if you agree or disagree with me - I'd welcome THAT kind of response.)ill pretty horny. Does she EVER leave the club, or is there club music playing EVERYWHERE she goes? \\"Bass\\" and \\"treble,\\" now she's using music terminology to talk about penises and vagina - wow, how 'inventive'. How 'cutting edge.' Yawn. And then Will throws in a few rapped lines in. Wow. The dry cliches are cracking under the heat as we speak. Snore...   6/10    09 - Trouble For Me - I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BRITNEY IS ACTUALLY SINGING??? Well, she breathes through it for about 30 seconds. This song is club-kid 1997 fabulous, and this might have been good. Now she wants the guy to try and pick her up in the club for once? How original... yeah, whatever...  5/10    10 - Trip To Your Heart - Be careful folks, here goes - I ACTUALLY LIKED THIS SONG! - vintage Britney 2002, vintage sound 2000, it's got this nice beat, this could have been her first REAL HIT off the album. Yes, she still wants to screw, but at least she's using her little tiny barely there squeaky voice and making it worth listening to... but WAIT A SECOND! In the chorus, I just heard shades of Shakira's \\"She Wolf\\" chorus in this song! Oops, Brit-Brit. Disqualified for plagurism...  4/10    11 - Gasoline - Britney is 'burning' so bad in her \\"naughty place\\" she's using chemical combustibles to describe what \\"someone\\" can \\"give her.\\" The beat's okay, though. Keep it away from me, though, because it's simply another throwaway song from the hype machine of the Madonna Jr. - I mean, Britney...   4/10    12 - Criminal - she's now 'singing' about every single guy she's been with since she crushed Justin's heart. Is that a flute I hear as well? I also liked this song too, because it's almost real-people normal. This might also become a hit for her, too.   7/10        So, overall? I'm giving the overall sound of the album 2 stars - this album might have been relevant if it had been released 3 years ago, before her producers \\"re-appropriated\\" her sound from grandma Madonna so many other newer, fresher styles out thereand have the decency to not make their ripoffs of said grandma so obvious.

B004LFO0FG|4.0|This is superstar Britney Spears' seventh studio album titled 'Femme Fatale', reportedly 2 years in the making. In her recent interview, she reported that this album will be a 'balance' of dance, hip hop/R 'n B and pop. A listen to this album reveals prominent 7 electro-dance tunes [\\"Till The World Ends\\" (great track), \\"Hold It Against Me\\" (her great first single & video), \\"I Wanna Go\\" (great track), \\"Seal With The Kiss\\" (okay track), \\"Trouble With Me\\" (okay track), \\"Trip To You Heart\\" (great track) & \\"Gasoline\\" (okay track)], 3 hip hop/R 'n B tunes [\\"How I Roll\\" (grea track),  \\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\" (great track featuring Sabi) & \\"Big Fat Bass\\" (okay track featuring the Black Eyed Peas's Will.I.Am)] & 2 pop tunes [\\"Inside Out\\" (great pop ballad with wonderful matching vocals) & \\"Criminal\\" (a solid pop ballad track/gem in the mold of tracks that made her famous in her earlier years. This is my favourite track from this CD 'Femme Fatale')]. On the overall, this will likely be a 'double-edged sword' type of her CD release to her fans : will be enjoyed by those who would embrace her evolution of her music, while others my be surprised at predominantly electro-dance-pop sound. Either way, a recommended CD listening.
1416596097|5.0|I had seen years ago adaptations of Le Carr&eacute;'s novels on PBS.  I remember I was not too familiar with the English language then, being a young immigrant from France.  To the young girl that I was, a spy movie was a James Bond movie.  Fast paced, humorous. And what did I get instead?  A Balzac of sorts examining the mechanisms of the undercover world.  I didn't expect the slowness, the introspection.  The subtlety.  And subtlety is tough when you're none too familiar with a language, as I mentioned above.<br /><br /> So I was intrigued by Le Carr&eacute;, but I abandoned him.  Or, should I say, I let Le Carr&eacute; be.  Maybe we'll meet again, I thought.  Hopefully we will.<br /><br /> And we did.  When during one of my trips I saw A Most Wanted Man on a bookstore shelf at the Pittsburgh airport, I decided to grab it.  I had other readings in waiting, so the book waited patiently, as only books know how.<br /><br /> And then it was time.  Would I like Le Carr&eacute;?  Would I be disappointed?  Would there be a distance between his world and my reading?  Would I plunge right into his universe?<br /><br /> The fact is, I was seduced by Le Carr&eacute;'s prose from the very start.  It is elegant, mysterious. It is a long walk into the night.  Incidentally, night is a crucial element in this novel.<br /><br /> The story, a Russian Muslim who seeks refuge in Germany and is defended by a beautiful civil rights lawyer, is what caught my attention at first.  What maintained my interest was the superb way Le Carr&eacute; is able to weave the personal with the political, without rushing anything.  He writes like a spider, catches the reader in his web.  At the same time, he adds layer upon layer of issues: immigration, love --both reciprocated and unreciprocated; the chicanery, duplicity, cruelty and/or brutality of international secret services.  Not only do they trick the innocent, but they trick each other, or vice versa.<br /><br /> So, of course, don't expect to dance the cha-cha-cha as soon as you finish the book.  But reading a good book does not necessarily equate a trip to Disneyworld.<br /><br /> Is there some weakness in the novel?  It is debatable.  Personally, I have trouble believing in the attraction the lawyer, who is a modern young woman, has for such a traditional Muslim young man who doesn't see women as equal to men.  But within his religious assertions the young man is vulnerable, and touching.  Furthermore, Le Carr&eacute; suggests that, on the sentimental level, our beautiful lawyer is troubled, lost.  Now, if this love is to be taken on the metaphoric level, as compassion toward immigrants, as an all encompassing humanitarian love, then the weakness just mentioned is no longer a weakness but an additional strength.  The poignancy lies in the fact that governments and their spying minions have absolutely no respect for what makes us humans.  In the end, it is not our tragedy, but theirs.ok does not necessarily equate a trip to Disneyworld.       Is there some weakness in the novel?  It is debatable.

Kingkiller is the story of young Kvothe as evidenced by Kvothe narrating his past to Chronicler over three days. I assume the second trilogy will be the story of old Kvothe overcoming his current lack of awesome and going out and facing the Chandrian, winning Denna's heart, and living happily ever after. Maybe not. But it will at least be his story after he finishes recounting his past to Chronicler.     See the SFF World interview Rothfuss gave on 2007-03-26 for him discussing 6 books.

B004EQAVHI|4.0|Never Let Me Go is director Mark Romanek's screen adaptation of [[ASIN:0307740994 Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 acclaimed novel]] of the same name. The film is buoyed up by a mostly superb cast, a haunting score by Rachel Portman, and an Alex Garland script that is largely faithful to the source novel. Despite widespread critical and audience disagreement over the true themes of the film, the generally positive reception is a testimony to its worth.    \\"Haunting\\" is the adjective most often used to describe the film, for good reason. Although the better-known Keira Knightley received top billing during the film's limited and unsuccessful 2010 theater run, it is Carey Mulligan as Kathy H. who owns the bulk of the screen time, and she delivers a sterling performance. If there is a weak link at all in the cast, it is probably Knightley, playing Ruth. Andrew Garfield as Tommy completes the triangle, and his strong turn ably complements Mulligan's.    The rather thin plot of the film has been described in detail elsewhere. Remarkably, almost no two people, even among the cast and crew, seem to fully agree on what the film is actually about. Love, mortality, humanity, and many other explanations have all been offered. I wouldn't presume to say anyone else's interpretation of the work's theme is wrong, but additional insight into what the creators were trying to say may be gained by viewing the film as an allegory rather than a straightforward (and thus largely pointless) cautionary tale about cloning people and stealing their organs.    Although allegory is a form of storytelling that has long been out of literary high fashion, there is still, in dystopian fiction in particular, a strong tradition of using allegory. [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]] was really about 1948. In its day [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]] was about a lot more than just sex. So it is incorrect to see Romanek, Garland, and Ishiguro as just stalely following in Larry Niven's footsteps 40 years after that science fiction author penned stories about kidnapping victims for their organs. Never Let Me Go isn't about clones or organ transplantations. Not specifically or solely, at any rate. It is about any group of persons, those society sees as non-persons, who are bereft of a voice to rail against the use others would make of them.    The film's clones represent any class of individuals who are dehumanized. Those forced into sexual slavery. Political prisoners in totalitarian countries (some of whose organs are harvested against their will; this much at least is not science fiction). Jews and Gypsies in concentration camps. The mentally handicapped. Children - including unborn ones. The aged and enfeebled. Slaves, historically and today.    Because the film's young, able-bodied protagonists would be capable of fighting back or attempting to flee, many observers have expressed frustration at the lack of any organized resistance to the organ-harvesting scheme. But once you see Kathy and her fellow clones an analogues of political prisoners, sex slaves, concentration camp detainees, warehoused nursing home patients, and so on, then that objection disappears. Kathy could fight or flee, but the type of powerless, impersonalized victim whom the character really represents usually cannot.    Though the allegory may seem heavy-handed once it is recognized as allegory at all, the film's creators have deliberately not simply drawn a parallel between their clones and any one group of those who have been unpersoned throughout history. Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth stand for anyone whose humanity, though obvious to us, has been denied by society at large.    That is the backdrop against which the film's performances take place. Because Never Let Me Go is about the dehumanization of the individual by society and the state - even though a whole class of such individuals may be in question - the focus is almost exclusively on Kathy and her two friends, plus a very small number of other people. There will be no massed battle here; it is not about setting one grandiose vision against another. It is about rejecting the interpretation of humanity as a collection of movements rather than as a (large) set of distinct individuals.    On this level, the film works superbly. Though intelligent, Kathy and the other clones cling desperately to what is obvious to the audience is the falsest of false hopes - because they have no other hope. Within the film, its title refers to a song of that name which becomes very important to Kathy in her adolescence. The characters experience nostalgia for a youth they never really had, even when young. They desperately try to cram experiences into their limited days. And they cling - and beg to be clung to, as in the song - to hope, love, and life.    It is a shame that distributors didn't trust American tastes more to have allowed this film a larger release. Hopefully, Never Let Me Go will enjoy a long life through DVD and other media, as its message is not that of an alternate 1970s in which cloning and organ harvesting are common, but a timeless one.

B004KSQN7C|4.0|Britney Spears returns to the pop scene with her seventh studio album 'Femme Fatale' and this effort by far is one of her best. Some have made the argument that this is her best album ever, even topping 2007's Blackout. A few (and really, a very small minority) think this is one of her worst and that she's put little effort into it. Before you purchase this album, there are a few things you should be aware of. First, this is one of the few Britney albums where she has no writing credits. Many find this to be an issue while I do not. Britney Spears, in my view, has never been seen as a great lyricist and the album's producers clearly know her music, her fanbase and crafted songs that fit her well. That brings us to the next big complaint: the album's producers/handlers. Hardcore fans complained that 'Femme Fatale' is an album forced onto Britney and that Dr. Luke (behind much of Katy Perry's success) simply favored his own troop of producers and artists and Britney had no say so in creating this album. Really? Having been a long-time Britney fan, I can tell you that this felt more like old-school Britney than the lukewarm, timid 'Circus.' Yes, Britney worked with a new group of people but they did not at all make her over into an artist she is not.<br /><br />The Bad: There are a few weak points to 'Femme Fatale' worth pointing out. A few of the standard tracks felt weak and uninteresting compared to what is considered to be the bonus tracks. Darkchild's tracks are pushed to the bonus category and sound completely different from the rest of the album. He noted that he listened to fans' complaints that Britney Spears is often over-autotuned and wanted to produce some music where he does little to her voice. These tracks are striking and some of my favorites but easily show how some of the Dr. Luke tracks feel a tad bit overproduced. I usually skip over \\"Trouble For Me\\" because Britney is autotuned to the point of being unrecognizable. Darkchild's \\"He About to Lose Me\\" and \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" are great and show that despite what we've been lead to believe, Britney really doesn't need to rely on autotune to create good music. The four bonus tracks are great and make the deluxe edition worth purchasing over the standard 12-track edition. They (\\"Up 'N Down,\\" \\"He About To Lose Me,\\" \\"Selfish\\" and \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\") are style-wise all over the place but are probably the most fun I've heard Britney Spears be in years. It's a shame more chances and experimentation couldn't have occurred on the album itself.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that I wish we'd been able to see what a few more producers could have done with Britney, under the direction of Dr. Luke (of course). The majority of the album has Dr. Luke's style and handprint all over it, which is fine, but some notable producers were pushed out including Danja (behind most of Britney's Blackout album) and William Orbit. It'd been interesting to hear their collaborations with Britney but those tracks were left out, unfortunately.<br /><br />The Good: That being said (and the reason I didn't give the album five stars), overall the album is great and will please longtime fans and those just looking for a fun, careless free, uncomplicated dance album to jam to. Britney herself stated she took 2 years to make this album because she wanted to choose music she could connect to and wanted to produce a dance album. Similar to 'Blackout,' 'Femme Fatale' is a non-stop party record. One marked improvement over both 'Blackout' and 'Circus' is that the lyrics and music felt a bit more mature by Britney's usual standards. While no album has let me down, this one puts her past work to shame. She's singing to people in their late teens and young adult years, ditching the cutesy, fluffy pop territory of songs like \\"Circus\\" or \\"Radar\\" to outright proclaiming that she's feeling sexual tonight (\\"Selfish\\"), revealing that she wants your body now (\\"Hold It Against Me\\") or that her body's on fire (\\"Gasoline\\"). What makes this album's music so enjoyable is that it felt like the old Britney Spears of years past is back: she's a bit more confident, she's on the prowl, she's unapologetic and feeling frisky all at once. She offers up a few ballads but they're all enveloped into catchy dance tunes that never let go of the party vibe.<br /><br />In all, sure, as with any Britney album there are going to be complaints. She's autotuned too much; why is she singing about things like self pleasuring herself when she's nearly 30 (\\"I Wanna Go\\"), the music doesn't sound like her, etc. On the one hand, all of those are valid complaints but they also set the stage for a catchy dance record that, dare I say, marks a much welcomed comeback musically for Britney after an album or two where she's felt a bit absent. She feels more into this record (musically speaking) than her past few efforts. There's definitely an edge and punch to the lyrics and in her voice that hasn't been there since perhaps her Oops ... I Did It Again record. What's so great about 'Femme Fatale' is that many of the tracks feel like instant classics due to the fact that they borrow from some of her past big hits. Don't let the few naysayers dissuade you from picking up this album: Britney is definitely back with one heck of an album that you'll be playing non-stop after the first listen.<br /><br />Listen to these: \\"I Wanna Go,\\" \\"Inside Out,\\" \\"Criminal,\\" \\"Selfish,\\" \\"He About To Lose Me\\"makes this album's music so enjoyable is that it felt like the old Britney Spears of years past is back: she's a bit more confident, she's on the prowl, she's unapologetic and feeling frisky all at once.

1936041138|4.0|I think we've all been told at one point in our lives to read the book before watching the movie. This seems like good advice since books often get translated quite loosely onto the big screen. If, however, you haven't followed this advice with Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, _Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, you may be in for a surprise. I was.<br /><br />Growing up, I'm sure I saw a couple of cartoon versions of this short story. If memory serves, the cartoons focused directly on the double-life of Dr. Jekyll. But as I read Stevenson's book the other night for the first time, I was struck by how the reader knows nothing directly about Dr. Jekyll until the final chapter of the book. Prior to that, the reader's knowledge is only as good as that of Dr. Jeykll's friends, whose observations and experiences are relayed by way of a narrator.<br /><br />There are many things I enjoy about this story. I like that it is a short story. It can be easily read in the space of an hour or two. I also find Stevenson's writing style very palatable. In describing Mr. Utterson's disposition, for example, he says, \\"His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time; they implied no aptness in the object.\\" Or how about this description of Dr. Lanyon?: \\"The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling.\\" And then there's a nice little statement in Dr. Jekyll's written correspondence to Dr. Lanyon: \\"I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night - ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor\\". Great writing!<br /><br />I like also the mystery and suspense of the story. It builds and progresses right up to the end. I wish only that I knew not a thing about the story when I read it. The initial reaction of discovering that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are two sides to the same coin, so-to-say, would have been a great reward with which to the finish the book.<br /><br />A final element that commends this short story is the interesting theme: the duality of man's life. I believe it was Blaise Pascal who aptly described man as a monster who passes all understanding. This marked contrast in human nature - the potential for both greatness and evil - is what I take to be Stevenson's theme. As Dr. Jekyll says in the closing pages, \\"...I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering.\\"<br /><br />_Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ is a creative and entertaining approach to the profound subject of the duplicity of man.nish the book.

Its like the studio said \\"get her in the studio, get her ass on tour, lets make some money\\". She needs to ditch her producers and see what she can create on her own.  I'm sure it would be great.

At the same time, the character of different world nations comes into play as they choose whether to protect their citizens or use their citizens as a human shield. When viewed simply at surface level, World War Z is a fantastically entertaining read. When considered on a deeper level, World War Z rises to the level of a literary masterpiece. My only regret is that I couldn't drag out the reading longer. I sped through it, since I couldn't put it down!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|very choppy and freezes a lot. other angry birds run perfect compared to this one. please fix and the game has great potential to be the best angry birds
B000000I0I|5.0|IMHO - I've completely enjoyed Mike Oldfield's music since the release of Tubular Bells and Ommadawn is one of my personal favorites. Many people say that this is Oldfield's peak. Well, although I love this recording, to make that sort of statement would be like saying, blue is better than green. Oldfield has created a superb musical catalog as a whole, no doubt. Ommadawn was and still is incredible and beautiful. I personally love it and have enjoyed it since it's release as with all the Oldfield recordings that I have (I think that I have them all). Enjoy!
0671449028|5.0|We have this entire series - we read them almost every night. My 5 year old now reads it to us. Both of my children boy and girl love this book!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Having played all 3 versions (original Angry Birds, Seasons and Rio), Rio so far is my favorite! Easy to install, and runs as smooth as butter on my Nexus S! As others have mentioned (and I agree with), Rio's graphics are much better, almost a 3-D feel to it.<br /><br />The change up to freeing birds, and taking out monkey's is also a nice change from just having pigs to target. I am looking forward to the other episodes opening up, in the upcoming months. And to get this game for FREE (at the time of writing this), you can't beat it!
B004CAWSKE|5.0|I discovered Delain a few months ago by listening to Pandora radio and could not help but notice that I really enjoyed every one of their songs that came on, so I bought this album.  I hardly ever buy music albums since they tend to contain only one or two great songs and a pile of \\"duds\\".  That was not the case this time.  Every song on here is excellent.  April Rain is worth every penny if you like symphonic metal music.    Since then, I have also purchased their first album, \\"Lucidity\\", which sadly does not hold a candle to this one.  Fortunately, April Rain more than makes up for this.  I can't wait for their next album!
B00003CXI1|5.0|My item arrived faster than I expected, and it was also in great condition!  I am very satisfied and I would recommend this seller to everyone!
B00005JOA0|4.0|Opinion is divided on this movie, and I think it's partly because its tone veers from the romanticism of the better known Bronte tales \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" It's a realistic, stark account of the powerlessness of women within marriage in Victorian England, specifically a marriage dominated by an abusive, alcoholic husband. I found Helen Graham's story very compelling, though you should be aware that some of the scenes of abuse are awful to watch. It is slow-moving, and I agree with others that Tara Fitzgerald's manner is sometimes too harsh. In the book, Helen is always a sympathetic character. But there are also moments when Fitzgerald's performance and those of the other actors are just superb. Rupert Graves as Helen's husband Arthur is truly scary. It's a difficult, dark subject that the movie handles well.<br /><br />Anne Bronte's book is beautifully written and, I think, underappreciated. One critic made the case for \\"Tenant\\" in this way: for every dashing, romantic hero like Heathcliffe in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" there are a dozen Arthur Huntingdons, the cruel husband in \\"Tenant.\\" I'm not sure the ratio is correct (I hope it's not!) but his point was that Helen's story reflects the real condition of many women and has a valuable lesson to tell.<br /><br />I will add that the story is not as irredeemably depressing as it sounds! Pulsing throughout the book and the movie is the theme of Helen's moral clarity and centeredness. Helen's moral courage saves her and her child and might have saved Huntingdon. Pious characters are often held up to ridicule these days, but Helen Graham makes piety admirable. It is also the story of the gentleman farmer Gilbert Markham, who bears witness to Helen's travails. His steadfast devotion to her is challenged but ultimately rewarded.

0312600844|5.0|Poignant and powerful! I couldn't put it down. I heard it first with our community library's book on CD and loved it so much that I went out and bought a copy from Costco, just so I can have a copy in my collection. Great read!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Each Christmas I enjoy seeing again the several versions of this Dickens short novel.  I read the work along with all of Dickens' other fiction, in a 10 volume gift set received 40 years ago, but long since lost in house movings.  When I noticed A Christmas Carol in among the Kindle free book offerings, it was time to revisit this lovely classic.  God bless them, every one of the faithful who convert these works to digital format!  Get it and read it in installments to your grandkids.  Who knows?  You may revive the art of reading aloud among friends and family!
B001O2MBP0|2.0|I ordered this movie over a month and a half ago and have still yet to receive it. I would not order from this company the_music_shop_au unless you have a lot of patience. I just hope my movie comes in eventually.
B004SBX112|4.0|For whatever reason Seasons had the worst ads of the Angry Birds games. There were times the game was almost unplayable until the ads went away. The lag was awful. So glad to no longer have to deal with this.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app all the time for simple to-do lists and quick shopping trips. The widget that puts a single sticky on your home page is wonderful. ColorNote is also easy to use. I would highly recommend this to any avid list-maker.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Best of the Angry Birds games. The levels are better balanced, the graphics are better, and the new terrain is a huge improvement. Must get for any Angry Birds fan.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this for my daughters and they love it!  It wasn't available locally so I thought I'd take a chance on it from Amazon....as Disney must have it in the vault!  A classic!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|The removal of ads improves the gameplay. No more lag at the beginning of the levels. No ads blocking sections of the level. And, same ol' angry birds.
0756404738|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has a writing style all his own that draws you in and makes you feel for the characters. This series is definitely worth the time to read.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is one of those books you keep reading amazing reviews. It was on my TBR pile but I couldn't find the time to read it until a few days ago, when I was looking for a romantic story  with a HEA ending.<br /><br />I really liked Anna. She was fun and light but also smart. I could easely relate to her, even when I haven't had the same experiences as her. If my parents sent me on my senior year to another country (even if it's Paris) I wouldn't be so happy. But even with that going on, she was always in a good mood and trying to have the best experience. She was a real girl, with doubts and scared, but also ready to take a chance.<br /><br />At first I wasn't completely sure about St. Clair. He seemed insecure and giving hope to Anna while he was with his girlfriend was mean. But then I thought Who isn't insecure at that age? Specially about love. He was also smart and good looking, and Anna liked him since the beggining. But I was glad it wasn't another one of those instant-love relationships, and I think that's why I liked so much this book. Nobody is perfect.<br /><br />Excellent characters, awesome writing, Anna and the French Kiss didn't let me sleep until I finished it. I loved, LOVED, that Anna and St. Clair were friends before being a couple. Usually it doesn't happen this way in young adult books, but I think it's more real.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and I can't wait to read other books from this author, as Lola and the Boy Next Door.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|to many 'enhancements' makes this version slow. finish a level game and watch the stars slowly paint. first levels to easy, makes the game boring.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Pretty awesome to play to kill time. but wish it save the level where I stopped at if I reset my phone once in while.
1439102813|5.0|An unforgettable book that should be read by everyone who is a caretaker for someone with Alzheimers or a terminal illness.  It generated much conversation and insight as a book club selection.
0385341679|5.0|I felt a little sad when I finished reading this book because I'm not quite ready to give up the Fever world and the characters.   Contrary to a few of the other reviewers, I was glad this book was so long.  I didn't mind all of Mac's inner dialog because I wanted this book to last as long as possible.    I was happy with how KMM finished the series.  She resolved all of the issues that were the most important, with nothing being predictable.  The twists and turns kept me guessing up until the very end.  She did leave a few items unresolved, which was nice as well.  It felt like there was a still a future for these characters after the series was over.    **************Spoiler Alert****************  I wasn't originally going to write any spoilers, but someone noted that my original review was not helpful, so I've decided to elaborate and revise my review.    I liked how KMM resolved the Unseelie King mystery.  No matter how sure Mac was that she was the UK, I never believed it.  However, when it got to the last couple chapters and no one else had been identified as the King, I really did start to wonder if we would ever know.  I did not see it coming that the UK was acually a combination of many characters (not saying who!) - or that he looked different to everyone.  I loved this twist.  It was great (and a little creepy) that he had been watching her for as long as he had.    I felt sure that Dani would have a plot twist because she was such a consistent character in the story, but I did not see her as a human killer.  That was a shock, as was the fact that she hadn't covered her tracks which didn't seem to match her character.  This part of the story seemed a little rushed to me because it happened so close to the end that it could not be explored much.  For this reason, I'm a little concerned that Dani may have a key role in KMM's next series about the Fever world, and I know I wouldn't enjoy reading a book written in Dani's slang.  My one negative comment on this book was that Dani's POV broke the flow of the book - the slang made it halting to read.    I did guess that there was some kind of War/Cruce/V'Lane/4th Rapist connection.  I had no idea how or when it would be discovered, but Ultimately I thought it was done well.  It played out in a way that explained all of the back story, motivations, and how it was accomplished. Once this mystery was solved, I could go back and identify all the forshadowing in the previous books.    One of the open-ended plot twists was Christian becomming non-human.  He clearly does not want this, but at the end there is no resolution for him.  I hope this means he'll have his own story in the next series.    The other major open-ended storyline is that neither the Unseelie King or the Seelie Queen will be resuming their Royal duties any time soon.  My hope is that they will eventually both take their thrones and join the light and dark sides of the Fae world together.  But who knows??  I'm sure we haven't read the last of these two.    The character of Barrons is one of my favorite book characters of all time.  I could read another dozen books about him.  My favorite male characters are always the reformed bad boys.  It's not that Barrons would ever be actually reformed, but the fact that he finally fell in love after hundreds of years of living - well, that hits me right in the heart.    I'm looking forward to KMM's next series!  I love how she writes.

B004LFO0ME|1.0|I've been a Wiz fan since \\"Flight School\\" and its sad to say that this is his worst piece of work by far. Even his new mixtape Cabin Fever was better than this garbage. How can you come out with a mixtape that is ten times better than your album. If you buy this album you will be disappointed.
0143145088|5.0|Fantastic!  I am thoroughly enjoying it.. Wish I had read it 10 years ago... have 14 yr old and could have benefited from the findings presented.  In a way I had an intuitive feeling about the trainof thought, but he articulates and presents the arguemnts far clearly  than  I could have.  So in a sense he is preaching to the choir.  Now have to get my husband and mum to read/hear it.  Recording is well done and it helps when the author reads it, as you get the full meaning of the written word.    Will recommend it to every one I know.  It is a tad scholarly, so a version for the layman will help... Need to get him or his work on the Colbert report and in other psychology circles.
B001I1M3CS|5.0|The book was in great shape and just how they described it. It was also delivered well within the time frame. I would definitely use them again!

B004SVM7BW|2.0|When it actually opens a PDF it works great. It has an easy to use highlighting feature, as well as an overall nice layout. Main problem is that for large files it simply crashes.   Another problem is that this version on Amazon is not the most updated one. Android Marketplace has the 3.1.2 while Amazon has 3.0.1.
B0036OS3N8|5.0|Very pleased with the boots. I did order the larger size and was glad I did. I chose the oyster color, it was less expensive I guess because of the color and they look great. People wear white runners why not white boots?

B004LP601S|5.0|I was so happy when I heard that Panic! At The Disco was coming out with a new album. I was scared that they weren't going to be the same, though, without their other members. I was SOOO wrong. This album is without a doubt, their best! It includes 10 songs:  1. The Ballad of Mona Lisa  2. Let's Kill Tonight  3. Hurricane  4. Memories  5. Trade Mistakes  6. Ready To Go (Get Me Out Of My Mind)  7. Always  8. The Calendar  9. Sarah Smiles  10. Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)    I love absolutely every song. My faves, though, are numbers 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. If you have liked Panic! ATD's previous hits and their single - The Ballad Of Mona Lisa - then you should DEFINITELY buy this album. You will not be sorry. =D

B004SBS8LA|3.0|Angry Birds Rio is a decent game that functions much the same as regular Angry Birds does. The main difference being there's no pigs. The game loses alot of its charm without them. Rovio needs to bring the pigs back. I love their snorkeling, taunting laughter. This game isn't much fun without them.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|The Strokes have evolved and nail it once again. If you're a strokes fan, you will undoubtedly grow to love this album. It has a little more of an 80's feel than the previous three albums, but it is a super easy listen through by a super amazing band.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Pigs are gone! lol, overall this app is awesome, I love it because it is add free on my Android phone (droid X) now only if they have a way off offering my current games add free.. It would suck to loose all that wasted time playing angry birds while waiting on others to get ready.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I have two boys - aged 6 and 3.  They both find this movie really scary and refuse to watch it.  It's quite a bit darker than the first two Toy Story movies so make sure you're with your little ones when they watch this one.  I really enjoyed the movie.  The ending always makes me cry.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I purchased this cd of Dexter for my cou7sin in PA because she has no tv.  Dexter is my absolute favorite show on tv and I always had to tell he cousin all about the show.

B004289ZW0|5.0|This review is just for my laptop running windows Streets and Trips.  I received the GNS 5870 today and wanted something that would communicate with the iPad 2 that I might buy.  But also wanted something that would run on Windows in case I decided not to purchase the iPad.  So here is what I find out using it on my laptop.  I find no fault with the swipe on the device.  I find that it's not meant to just use the tip of your finger but to use the flat of the finger and swipe across and it works ever time for me.  Now running Windows Streets and Trips it works fantastic that all I can say about that you won't be disappointed.  This is my first day and only traveled around town but that fine.  Another reason I purchased this was because of another tablet that I am interested in and thats a Asus Eee Slate EP121 64Gb running Windows 7.  Now you check out the USB and SD and other features that this until has that the iPad doesn't and the fact that all my programs are already Windows bases such as Outlook and that's part of my reasoning.  But the wife would like the iPad.  I really think the next version of both (Asus and iPad3) will be the ones to get but it's hard to wait for such nice units, both of them.  Oh, the little computer that I am running the GNS 5870 and the Acer Aspire One.  Also the Aspire One has a bluetooth mouse with the flush fitting dongle that the GNS 5870 works through.  I also figure since the GNS 5870 says it's special for the iPad and others in that line without doing the jailbreak that I won't have any problem with that method either.

B004ODLUF8|2.0|I am a huge fan of NASA and highly respect the brave astronaut community. I visited Cape Canaveral a few years ago and was mesmerized. That said, this film is a disappointment. FIRST - WHAT IT IS NOT: It is NOT a film about the fantastic images shot through the Hubble telescope. Yes, about 1/4 of the film is that, but it is far too short. MOST OF IT IS about the astronauts, suiting up, launching and then repairing the telescope. We were disappointed. This was a grand opportunity to present the awe and wonder of space through visualizing the images brought back from the Hubble itself. Instead we were given images of astronauts unscrewing bolts in space and discussing the lack of toilet facilities while on EVAs. Again, hats off to the courage of the astronauts. However, PLEASE PRODUCE A FILM WITH THE MAJORITY OF FOOTAGE COMING FROM THE HUBBLE ITSELF. The magesty of God's universe is a show of a lifetime in itself.

B000WAEK0E|4.0|For those who want to spend their money wisely \\"Still on Top- The Greatest Hits\\" is a good choice. Van Morrison is a well-known musician and this collection of his songs, with one or more borrowed from another artist, will keep you entertained for hours. From \\"Moon Dance\\" to \\"And it Stoned Me\\" you will find any song for your particular mood. I recommend this album collection to anyone I know needs a peaceful but fun ride.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I bought this album this morning and I can't stop listening to it. Yes, I agree it's not Britney's best work (I grew up listening to her and in my opinion, her best work was when she first began.) but I really like this album. It's fun, it's upbeat. It's a club album and that's what I was looking for on this Britney album.     1.) Till the World Ends: I know a lot of people are not too fond of this song, but I love it. It's catchy, it's fun. 4/5.  2.) Hold It Against Me: The first FF single. Not her best song but it has grown on me. 4/5.  3.) Inside Out: I think this is my favorite song off the album. The melody is beautiful and the lyrics are catchy. \\"Hit me one more time it's so amazing.\\" 5/5.  4.) I Wanna Go: I LOVE this song. It's refreshing, I don't think I've heard a song quite like it before. 5/5.  5.) How I Roll: This is such a cute song! 4/5.  6.) (Drop Dead) Beautiful: This song is not as great as I thought it was gonna be. It's okay. 3/5.  7.) Seal It With a Kiss: Another catchy song. The lyrics are really cute. 4/5.  8.) Big Fat Bass: I LOVE this song. I know a lot of people aren't too fond of it, but it's such a fun song. Perfect club song! 5/5.  9.) Trouble For Me: This song was a little hard to get into...but it has grown on me. 4/5.  10.) Trip To Your Heart: Love this song! It's perfect. 5/5  11.) Gasoline: This song seems to be upon the most popular on the album, but it's okay. 4/5.  12.) Criminal: Another one of my favorites. The lyrics might be controversial but it's a beautiful song. 5/5.  13.) Up N Down: Catchy, fun song. 4/5.  14.) He About To Lose Me: This song has yet to grow on me. 3.5/5  15.) Selfish: I really like this song. 4/5  16.) Don't Keep Me Waiting: LOVE this song! Why isn't it on the album and not as a bonus song?! It reminds me of Janet Jackson's \\"Black Cat.\\" 5/5.    This album is perfect for clubbing or working out. I really enjoy it!
0756404738|3.0|*contains spoilers*<br /><br />Four years ago I picked up The Name of the Wind on a whim and absolutely loved it. Patrick Rothfuss created a world and characters that didn't fit into the usual mold of every other fantasy novel. I've recommended NotW to many people and have had the same incredible feedback from them.<br /><br />So I couldn't wait for the second book and looked for it every time I went to the bookstore. When it came out, I immediately downloaded it to my Kindle and dug in.<br />I hate that I am not over the moon about The Wise Man's Fear. I hate that I was disappointed with a book that I have been eagerly awaiting for 4 years.<br /><br />The book picks up and takes off swiftly, with Kvothe telling his life story and placing him right back into the struggles of the university. It moved right along until Kvothe took leave of school and traveled abroad. The story then becomes bogged down in unnecessary (??) details about people and cultures like a beautiful moth in honey.<br /><br />As a writer myself, I can tell how much Rothfuss loves his characters and loves the world that he's created. He knows the cities and cultures inside and out; their death rituals, how they dispose of garbage, hand down punishment, birth traditions, etc. He respects his characters and respects the reader, but in The Wise Man's Fear he is simply too self-indulgent and the plot moves far too slowly.<br /><br />In a whopping 1,000 + pages Rothfuss covers approximately a year and Kvothe spends most of the time in Vintas, tracking bandits, spending an unknown time under the spell of a Felurian and learning an entire language, culture and fighting skills in Adem. In each of these places, Rothfuss details customs, histories, languages, songs, poetry, stories and cultures with fastidious skill, but as a reader it was too much to absorb. I would read a hundred pages, swearing to myself that around the next page some action was going to take place. It rarely did.<br /><br />Not to say that the writing wasn't superb and the subject matter interesting, but there times where I wondered if I were reading an anthropology of a culture, rather than a plot driven book.<br /><br />Then there's my own personal taste in Kvothe's love interest, which I am finding less and less interesting. Denna goes from a beautiful mysterious vagabond to battered woman and it left a bitter taste in my mouth. So on top of everything else, Kvothe dedicates himself to an abused woman - oy vey.<br /><br />I am hoping that the third novel will be more rewarding as a reader instead of just being rewarding for the author. This is a valuable lesson for me as I continue to write my own book.<br /><br />In spite of a 3 star review, I went ahead and bought the hardcover in addition to my digital copy to sit next to The Name of the Wind on my bookshelf.interesting, but there times where I wondered if I were reading an anthropology of a culture, rather than a plot driven book.

I am hoping that the third novel will be more rewarding as a reader instead of just being rewarding for the author. This is a valuable lesson for me as I continue to write my own book.    In spite of a 3 star review, I went ahead and bought the hardcover in addition to my digital copy to sit next to The Name of the Wind on my bookshelf.
B003UESJFG|4.0|I wasn't too thrilled about going to see this with my daughter, but I'm glad I did.  Will Ferrell lends his crazy sense of humor to this movie and between him and David Cross (Minion), the back and forth with them was great.  With an all star cast of comedians, great animation and amazing picture on Blu ray, this is a must have.  My kids love it for the silly humor and I must say, so do I.

B003Y74AXO|4.0|This screen protector was easy for me to apply. I've used a more expensive brand on my iPhone, so comparing to that I would say this is relatively the same as far as application. I've always used a credit card for the air bubble removal. I've found the cards included aren't helpful. The cloth provided cleaned the screen well enough to remove all dust particles. For an Amazon Basic brand, I would assume the price would be half what it is at the time of writing ($10). I originally saw it for $15 so it is coming down to a more reasonable price. There is still glare on the screen. If your looking for basic, I'd start here. Higher priced screen protectors, I have found, are higher price for a reason...they are just better.
0670022411|3.0|I had two issues with the book.    1) I found it a bit difficult to wrap my head around the alchemy/biology/darwinisms,etc.  Maybe science just isn't my thing.  I got the point of what was going on - but did not find it an easy read in that aspect.  I really needed to be at the Bodleian myself surrounded by books for reference.    2) Matthew Clairmont.  Liked him - liked his family and friends more.  HOWEVER - spoiler alert - did the author NOT read Twilight?????  Same scenario.  He is cold (somewhat hard), he has sharp teeth - but no fangs, he can go out in sunlight, he doesn't sleep, he is overprotective of his female.  Totally smacked of Edward Cullen whom I LOVE - but really?  One is enough - been there - done that.  Really, really disappointed.  However, I liked Matthew Clairmont in spite of similarity of Edward.    I also enjoyed the heroine Diana.  No, she was not perfect - she seemed to embrace being taken care of like a child a bit too easy, but I have a feeling in the next installment things will change.    There are many twists and turns in this book and multiple characters I liked, which overall made the book enjoyable.  I read for pleasure and don't necessarily note if a character is flat or multi-dimensional.  I just know if I like him/her/it.    I await the sequel; but recommend visiting the library FIRST and saving your money.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Clint Eastwood portrays Walt, an average everyday retired auto worker & a veteran of the Korean war.  He lives in a run-down section of Detroit (please pardon my redundancy!).  Walt is a crotchety old hermit who would like everyone to believe that he is cold & heartless.  Just one problem:  in spite of a rough exterior, Walt has a heart of gold!<br /><br />At his wife's funeral he finds that his two sons & their families are selfish & narcissistic.  They only care for Walt insofar as the property they will inherit from him after he passes away.  Not exactly solace for a man who has worked hard all of his life!<br /><br />Juxtaposed with his self-centered family are Oriental neighbors who live around Walt.  After inadvertently rescuing a young man from the attack of a gang, Walt becomes something of a hero to his neighbors.  Unlike his own family, who could care less about him, the racist retired Ford worker finds them to be eternally thankful to them, and much more gracious than his own family would  ever dream of being.<br /><br />This is the outline of the film.  In some ways, it is a little bit like a raw, violent, downtown Detroit version of [[ASIN:B00005ASOC Finding Forrester]].  To be sure, the thugs in the film are unreasonable in every way ~ straight out of [[ASIN:B0012XIGXC Gangland: The Complete Season One]].  They're not much in the brains department, but their anarchist approach to life makes them scary dudes.<br /><br />One of the more remarkable things about this movie is just how ordinary all of the characters are.  These are people all of us have dealt with in our everyday lives ~ both good & bad.  There are no supermodel actresses in the film, & there is no lush scenery.  It's just Clint Eastwood and the drab scenery of the city of Detroit (I've been there myself, and it's hardly a scenic locale).  These aspects are not a negative of the movie, but rather they just drive-home how much the film depicts the life of everyday personas.<br /><br />I swear that Clint Eastwood's scowl is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, \\"shaken, not stirred\\" & \\"I'll be back.\\"  Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of Clint's, this instant-classic is a must-see.  For myself, this is my very favorite CE movie.  If you're not a big fan of his style, this DVD just might compel you to change your mind about the big fella!is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, \\"shaken, not stirred\\" & \\"I'll be back.\\"   Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.

B00377V6J2|4.0|Some of the finest blues guitar you'll ever see or hear.  And some of Albert King's absolute best stuff.  Highly recommended for fans of Stevie Ray and Albert - or anybody who even pretends they're into electric blues. I like the song selection on the DVD even better than the CD - and all of the banter is truly inspired, as well.  Albert is old school and he intends to teach the \\"new kid\\" who's in charge.  Stevie Ray is a thrilled and thrilling student.  There have been a lot of duets lately that have been forced or just plain strange.  In this session - the two bring out the absolute best in the other.  Also - should mention the back-up band - who are nothing less than first rate with an almost telepathic feel for what both guitarists lay down.  Breathtaking - invigorating - the best blues album of at least a decade.
142311339X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It was good to go back to Camp Half Blood again and learn more about some of the characters in that series.

0439023513|4.0|The final installment of a story is always vulnerable to the wrath of distraught fans.  I suspect that there is a psychological filter made of feelings of angst and abandonment that we, the readers, unconsciously wear like glasses as we read the end of something we have enjoyed.  Of the three \\"Hunger Games\\" stories, I cared for \\"Mockingjay\\" the least, but I think my feelings are tainted by my sadness over this being the end.    I liked how Collins avoided the typical shiny ending.  This isn't to say that the ending doesn't shine, but it was a story about people living in an aggressive, post-apocalyptic society...logically, the reader must suspect that it won't end with rainbows, unicorns and happiness as far as the eye can see!    My strongest complaint is the nagging suspicion that Collins was under the gun to finish the final chapters, and therefore crammed a bunch of ideas into a chapter or two at the end.    Having read the first two books in this trilogy, I'm glad that I bought this book.  The best word I can come up with for the ending is anticlimactic; it was really good, but felt abandoned at the very end.

B004NSULHM|4.0|Aside from the onslaught of artwork that accompanies this release, this collection of songs is something of a disappointment -- not that it's a terrible record nor a waste of time and money.  Radiohead has the misfortune of having built themselves an overwhelming reputation of legendary virtuosity on multiple levels: writing, performing, engineering, producing.  This album is no different in this respect: the execution and recording aspects are simply awe-inspiring, and there are moments of perfection in the recording, and they are evolving as a collaborative entity: \\"Codex\\" is a beautiful example of when everything simply goes right.<br /><br />But when you're Radiohead, and your latest release spans three years since your last release (which was an amazing album), and the release contains only eight songs (again, quite a limited selection juxtaposed against their other releases), every one of those songs had better be really, really good.  But they're not.<br /><br />\\"Feral\\" is okay ... if you're into midnight raves and waving beach balls around in the streets.  \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" starts off with great energy but quickly reminds one of \\"Canary in a Coal Mine\\" by The Police, but doesn't withstand the pace for long.  \\"Separator\\" seems like a hold-over from some other project, as do a few other selections.  Indeed, Mr. Yorke has kept himself quite busy and has been involved in many projects with many artists, and there is a sense that those collaborations are beginning to bleed into one another, whereas previous Radiohead releases seemed their own, distinct entities.  \\"The King Of Limbs\\" could easily have been a b-side collection or bonus disc to Yorke's solo \\"Erasure\\" effort.<br /><br />While any Radiohead fan simply must own this album, listen to it religiously, and appreciate its technical brilliance, it's just not the band's best effort.  In fact, I would dare say that not only is this not their best album, but they've released \\"bonus\\" discs and collector's edition discs that are better collections of quality songs in general (see: \\"In Rainbows\\").better collections of quality songs in general (see: \\"In Rainbows\\").
B004G6009U|5.0|Just saw this film last night and I had to say that there were so many textures in all aspects - the characters are just lovely to look at and had so much personality (than most real live actors); the songs are funny with great melodies; the dialogue is charged with wit and charm; the animals don't talk (what a relief!) but are still hilarious and necessary (sone scenes wouldn't have worked without them); the storyline is refreshingly entertaining although you have to really look closely to see the subtle fairy tale details of Rapunzel in the film or you'd miss it. This fresh take on the Rapunzel story is well made and different, but it is very, very good. Bravo Disney. 5/5 stars.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Simply put: the greatest, most beautiful, and most profound animated movie ever. In addition to all of its other many qualities listed by other reviewers, I most appreciate the spirit of love and restoration that pervades the movie. Two of the characters are river spirits who are suffering due to the pollution and destruction of rivers, and who have come to be restored. If you watch the excellent \\"making of\\" featurette, you discover that writer/director Hayao Miyazaki was inspired by his personal experience restoring a river. If you want your children to be spiritually prepared for the fast-growing global Restoration Economy, this movie will help prepare them inwardly for a life that leaves our world healthier, wealthier, and more beautiful.

I was able to find a channel that was free and switch my router over to that, problem solved.

B004J4WQ46|2.0|The brevity of this review will reflect the slim pickings in this album. Very ordinary effort indeed from The Strokes. It's a really bad sign when a first listen to a long-anticipated album makes no impression on you at all. It's normal to make a mental note of at least two songs to return to and give attention. But here? The whole album is so undistinguished that it's scarcely possible to tell one track from another.     I will say that in the continuum of dullness track two protrudes slightly above the rest: but that's all. The album comes across as a kind of flatlining effort: the sound of The Strokes is present, but only the sound. The gritty class, the creativity? Gone. And it's a worry that it took so long to produce so little. I really do hope that having been so lauded for so long, the Strokes aren't falling prey to Stanley Kubrick Syndrome: i.e., slowing creative output, and correspondingly degrading artistic quality.    I look forward to their next effort. Let's hope it's not another five-year wait.
030726999X|4.0|I loved the Millennium Trilogy. Amazing plot and powerful characters. But I have to say, Hornet's Nest is not that good alone. While I enjoyed it a lot (that's why I gave it 4 stars), I did make sure to have it right before I finished the second one. Like many people said, the first book in the series is the best by itself: it has a complete story that starts and ends on that book. The third one starts right where the second one finished. But, don't get me wrong, the plots and twists don't disappoint. Some of the \\"side stories\\" seem random and unnecessary, but still entertains.

0385341679|5.0|Although the lengthy passages of MacKayla's tormented, inner dialogues are much too numerous and overly fraught, they fail to diminish the strength of this modern morality-fantasy. Borne of only lightly-touched realms and characters first introduced in Moning's original, but light and sexy, Highlander series, the 5-book Fever epic takes the reader on a romantic ride while it also plumbs the darkest crevices of the human psyche. What is desire? How are those who are \\"good\\" ever able to love those who are seriously flawed or even evil? How do they--or can they--remain good inspite of such a love? What creates evil? Can love and sacrifice exonerate destruction and murder? What choice would we be ours if we were made to choose between accepting the reality of an imperfect world, or grabbing ultimate power with both hands? Does absolute power always corrupt absolutely? If our own inner demons were given flesh, how would they appear? (In Moning's Fever series, those inner beasts are reminiscent of the id-daemons in Pullman's Dark Materials Trilogy.)        The solid craftsmanship of Moning's plotting sets the reader in a continual turmoil of shifting truths, bizarre worlds, heart-stopping action, and a profound yearning to know not just the truths about MacKayla and Barrons, but of ourselves as well. As MacKayla seeks out the ultimate truths to the answers she seeks, she discovers that, as Solomon long ago mused, there is much vexation in knowledge and the greater the knowledge, the greater the vexation. As she moves ever closer to that which she seeks, she is forced to unravel her own perceived worlds, her own constants. T.S. Elliot and the Bible, all figure into the final confrontations. She weathers the storms and turbulence of her journey to \\"recognize where she is for the first time...\\" She must also bear witness to a god who chooses to destoy his own son to save the world, yet still leaves the world adrift and on its own.       The strengths of the final Fever book are great, but many flaws are to be found. MacKayla's \\"Daddy\\" musings are tedious. In fact, too much time is given to MacKayla's adoptive family, and it diminishes the strength of character that she is supposed to be acquiring. While the character of Dani is somewhat intriguing, she comes off as surprisingly irritating. Readers can sympathize with Dani's vulnerability and yearning to grow up and love during a time of war and danger. They can also accept MacKayla's need to forge a sisterly bond with her, but they can't sympathize with the self-absorbed, fatally-immature Dani who Moning fleshes out in this final book. While some reviewers have complained about the addition of the Keltar Druids as well as Adam Black, their presence was a necessary fit to the pragmatics of the Fever world that was established in the Highlander novels. The problem is that the Keltars' introduction into the plot lacked the proper groundwork. Perhaps an editing of MacKayla's inner diaglogues could have given more space for the necessary imagery and depth they deserved. Another serious flaw is the almost blithe treatment of Christian McKelter in the silvers as well as his condition at \\"the end.\\" This treatment didn't ring true with Mack's character who agonizes over all things human.     All in all, Shadowfever is a satisfying last chapter in the series. It's easy to see that Moning's Fever world will surely give way to additional and even better stories if we compare the quantum leap she made from her Highlander series. Barron's friends have their own stories to tell, as do Kat and her sidhe sisters, and there's still that evil, but scrumptious Cruce/Sisar Dubh tucked away in all his naked majesty, in the abbey cavern. (But, please, no more Dani, nor Jack and Rainey.)

B004KSQN7C|4.0|Britney Spears occupies a weird, unique space in the pop spectrum. She's been compared to past greats like Madonna and Kylie Minogue, but she lacks the latter's self-aware creativity and mentioning her in the same breath as the former is, frankly, insulting. A common complaint with Spears is that she doesn't write her own songs, which, the argument goes, somehow equates to a lack of talent, but the same can be said of Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra... the list goes on. She isn't blessed with the preternaturally skilled vocals of a Mariah Carey or a Tina Turner, but her music has never been about her voice so much as her personality. And her personality is just what has carried her this far, when contemporaries like Mandy Moore and Christina Aguilera are becoming Starbucks whores and public laughingstocks, respectively. Spears is the ultimate pop chameleon, transforming from sly school girl with enough sexual innuendo to inspire thousands of illegal fantasies to a robotic dance-floor dominatrix, confident enough to overcome tabloid dramas that have ruined lesser stars. In many ways, Spears needed that separation from her past self to become the four-on-the-floor mistress she is on Femme Fatale. Calling Britney a pop singer is doing the term a disservice; she is much more of a pop bellwether, subject to the whims of the Top 40 crowd and more than happy to adapt to environments that have cruelly undone lesser icons. There's a reason Aguilera's last album sold barely north of 110,000 copies and Spears' single \\"Hold It Against Me\\" has the most aggressive beat on mainstream radio today. Spears shows a willingness to reinvent herself that belies her fragile personal life and, most importantly, keeps her on the cutting edge of pop music.<br /><br />Sure, \\"Hold It Against Me\\" has the kind of dubstep breakdown that only the most naïve listener would consider representative of the genre, but the fact remains that Spears is the first to introduce such a rapidly rising phenomenon to the mainstream. She's become a pop juggernaut not by being the most talented, or the most charismatic, or even the one with the best songs, but by simply listening to the people who know the pop pulse best: her stable of producers. Blackout became such a great modern pop album because Spears finally submitted entirely to her songwriting team, choosing to become the entirely sexualized instrument through which their massive hooks would be transmitted to neon dance floors worldwide. And for Spears, that is just what she needs: a Max Martin and a Dr. Luke to write a track like \\"Till The World Ends,\\" one that throbs with trance-y synths, a thumping electro beat that is pure sex and a chorus that goes and goes as only the best club hits can do, sensible lyrics be damned. Synths as dirty as the ones on \\"Trouble For Me\\" or as unashamedly Eurotrash as \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" are just what pop music needs right now, in a year when electronica is becoming bigger than ever and a pop song is not just about the hook but about how much it can make you move.<br /><br />Yet while one can be assured that Spears' lyrics remain as one-dimensional and cheesy as ever, it's the sonically varied production work that prevents Femme Fatale from being a one-hit factory with a bunch of electro clones. It helps that Spears' sounds much more involved than she did on the rather dispirited Circus, with even a by-the-numbers Dr. Luke jam like \\"Gasoline\\" showing some Spears vocal pizzazz, as much as a Auto-Tuned sexual android as she tends to sound. The real treat of the record lies in the more off-kilter tracks, like Bloodshy & Avant's (better known as indie band Miike Snow) skeletal, vaguely African-flavored \\"How I Roll\\" and their rave day-glo specimen \\"Trip To Your Heart,\\" a track that would make Tiesto blush. For all its obvious chart-topping intent and single-minded dance directive, Femme Fatale is an eclectic record, and that's why for every ill-advised will.i.am guest spot(\\"Big Fat Bass\\"), there's an out-of-left field flute (!?!) solo that actually works (\\"Criminal\\"). It isn't exactly the progressive stylings of a Janelle Monae, but it's always catchy and interesting.<br /><br />So, Britney Spears: pop icon or pop puppet, someone with the genuine foresight to see where the winds are blowing or one lucky enough to have a team of handlers to decide which direction she should go in? It will always be hard to tell, even though I'm inclined to lean towards the former considering Blackout had her pushing the pop boundaries years before electronic music was truly a driving force in mainstream culture. Perhaps it's easier to just say that Britney is Britney and nothing more - someone who is more a distinctive sound and a driving force of sex nowadays than a genuine musical talent. Femme Fatale, after all, is a flawed album, with lyrics that barely clear the level of a Ke$ha and a maturity level to match. But it's a pop album that's supposed to make you dance, and when it comes to that, there's not a star out there that can match Ms. Spears., there's an out-of-left field flute (!?!) solo that actually works (\\"Criminal\\").

0718154770|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I was able to see a bunch of the episodes of the TV show on YouTube and wrote down every single detail of each episode but now I have the whole thing right in front of me!!!  I ADORE cooking in metric units, I bought a small and very easy to use scale on amazon.com for around $12 a while back and I'm constantly converting all my stupid US measuring units to metric.  Why on earth would anyone try baking with out actually weighing ingredients ... I digress.  The layout of each meal actually makes it easy to get the whole thing on the table in 30 minutes.  I am an experienced cook with a good set of tools so I'm sure that helps as well but I've made the Steak Sarnie dinner and the Killer Jerk Chicken (my two favorites) several times and got them on the table in no time flat.    I did notice that one of the big differences between finding/sourcing ingredients here versus in the UK (or at Irish grocery stores that I am familiar with such as Superquin and the UK Marks & Spencer) is that packages are usually larger.  You don't often find a small 250 gram sack of rice - we are jumbo size!  And whole tinned tomatoes (Jools Favorite Pasta) usually come in giant 32 oz cans rather than the smaller ones.  Oh well.  I make very good use of the bulk bins at Whole Foods.  There are also some differences in the names of the cuts of beef and a few veggies - just goole it if you really get stuck and don't know that aubergine and eggplant are the same thing.  And Jamie's readers also have ready access to Marks & Spencer which is a high-end grocery story that stocks TONS of excellent prepared ingredients that are only starting to become common over here.  I haven't seen cooked beets anywhere except for Whole Foods and that was a new product.    I've also gone back through some of Jamie's other family-friendly food books (Food Revolution) and converted some of the Indian curries into 30 minute meals too.  I love the method for cooking Jerk chicken - wizz themarinade in the blender while browning the skin on the stove in your non-stick skillet and then finish the whole thing off by baking it right in the sauce in the oven.    This is now one of my favorite books and you really can get stuff on the table in 30 minutes; this is not your Rachel Ray tasteless crap.  And I also find that this is truely home-chef friendly.  I have a few other nice Jamie books that I don't think are as good for the average home chef.

B000LPQ6DE|1.0|I am a big fan of the book and love all things British. I especially wanted to see this re-make because I adore Toby Stephens.<br />But during the whole movie I was massively distracted by the actress who played Jane Eyre.<br />I hope her lips are natural and that she did not purposefully inject her lips with something.<br />But regardless, they were extremely annoying.<br />It took away from everything and after stumbling through the movie I gave the DVD away.<br />Duck lips needed to go. I'm amazed the director and producers didn't notice it before they filmed. Even the DVD cover shows the duck lips in all their glory.<br />Horrible.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I personaly enjoyed the new cd from Gregg Allmond, if you like his gravely voice you will truly enjoy this. How ever I am a very big fan of his.  The songs are heart sent and touching with a lot of country blues to it, just like the lable. I am not a big country fan but I really enjoyed this cd.  It was good to hear something new from him again I hope there is more to come.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I saw Britney in concert when she was on her \\"Circus\\" tour.  I have never been a big fan but, I was shocked how great she was in concert.  I really enjoyed the evening and was curious what this new CD would bring.  Some of the songs are just OK. I can only assume this CD will be a success because, she has a very loyal fan base who love her no matter what.  I like Selfish and Don't Keep Me Waiting.  I have always been more of a fan of her \\"non-hit singles.\\"  Nevertheless, she has been at this for quite sometime and I have to admire someone who can keep a loyal fan base for so many years.

B000JXYJLE|4.0|On each of McKennitt's previous albums, there has been at least one song that completely enraptured me.

B0017U7PT6|2.0|A movie as bonkers as Roland Emmerich's 10,000 B.C. really ought to be a lot more fun than this actually is. Partially inspired by some of Graham Hancock's less daffy theories of a lost higher civilisation in the Stone Age who really built the pyramids, this sees Steven Strait's hunter-gatherer setting off after the slavers who took the love of his life and the village's other hunters to build the pyramids (with a little bit of help from mammoths, of course). The title promises enjoyable nonsense along the lines of the Harryhausen One Million Years B.C., and with a sabre-tooth tiger and some Terror Birds thrown into the mix the elements are certainly there for good old fashioned brain-off entertainment, but at times it feels almost as long a slog as the one that takes its hero from the barren mountains of New Zealand across Namibia to the plains of Giza. Certainly the first half is pretty dull, with even the scene with Terror Birds (think big turkeys with big teeth, which is at least appropriate for Christmas) picking off slaves and slavers alike in long grass playing like a considerably less effective version of the velociraptor attack from Spielberg's The Lost World with a bit of Mysterious Island thrown in for bad measure.<br /><br />Things do finally pick up a bit when they finally reach `the mountains of the Gods,' but not really enough. It may be the most spectacular part of the picture but at times it feels like an early rejected draft of Stargate - oh look, another evil godlike villain who may be an alien or from Atlantis, and what's this, revolting slaves led by a white man from a far-off land? Clichés like this really need more panache than they're given here to come off, and the casting doesn't exactly help you overlook the film's shortcomings. Steven Strait isn't exactly blessed with much charisma as the reluctant hero, coming over a bit like Colin Farrell's well meaning younger brother, Camilla Belle is awful pretty but it's hard to tell if she can actually act when she doesn't have much to do except look confused, the ever-erratic Cliff Curtis is pretty awful here and Omar Sharif manages the almost impressive feat of both underplaying and overacting his narration that seems intended to paper over the gaps and add a bit of emotion to the proceedings (the deletion of his cameo in the original ending spared audiences the worst of his performance, though it can be found on the DVD and all-region BluRay along with 10 deleted scenes and a couple of brief featurettes). Matters aren't helped by co-writer/co-producer/co-composer (with Thomas Wander, ne Wanker) Harold Kloser's score which constantly turns into Hans Zimmer's main theme from King Arthur with such monotonous regularity that you start expecting Maire Brennan to start singing. Even with low expectations this is disappointing stuff.
1433502410|5.0|When I was younger I used the NIV.  As I learned about translations and translation approaches I moved to the NKJV.  Pnce I discovered the NASB I appreciated the detail in translation and used that for a while.  However, the ESV brought me the readibility of the NIV and NKJV with the detail and accuracy of the NASB.  I now use the ESV exclusively for preaching and reading.  I use several translations to study along with a few Greek/Hebrew Bible sites, but my favorite for accuracy and readibility together is the ESV.  I love the Study Bible as well- I have it on my iPhone, a Leather Bound copy and an internet account for my iMac.  I do not preach out of the ESV Study Bible because it is quite large; I preach out of a regular ESV leather bound thin-line Bible.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|\\"I slept with a witch. That's gotta be bad. I put my thing in a witch. It was a while back...\\" \\"Oh Beowulf, it's a ******** troll. Maybe someone looked at it the wrong way.\\" \\"I know, I look like walrus ****.\\"<br /><br />Another costume turkey flung upon an unsuspecting and utterly disinterested world in the wake of The Lord of the Rings' success, Beowulf and Grendel is a curious beast and a far less interesting spin on the original than either Outlander or the undervalued The 13th Warrior. On one level it wants to be a revisionist `reimagining' of the epic poem, yet the budget seems to run out on a daily basis leaving sequences an odd mixture of impressively shot footage and scenes almost inept enough to be from a Robbie Moffat fillum, as if it was made by a director with a half-thought out vision he didn't have the ability to bring properly to the screen. If anything it feels like it was made by two completely different directors at extreme opposite ends of the skills scale with two completely different visions (not beyond the realms of possibility in a film boasting 14 credited producers), the casting a similarly odd mixture of good actors who should know better (Stellan Skarsgard, Sarah Polley, Eddie Marsan) roped in by what seems like a bunch of blokes from a Scottish rugby team who pooled together their bonuses to make a film for a lark, one of whom is taking it way too seriously and overacting in the genuine belief that this is his starmaking role (step forward Gerard Butler, the man who would be Connery but just comes across like a young Shouty Shouty Brian Blessed).<br /><br />It doesn't help that far from a monstrous incarnation of all the evils plaguing man and society that must be destroyed, this Grendel goes from laughably bearded infant to what looks like a Glaswegian cage-fighter and is now the true victim of the tale, in the process diminishing Beowulf's heroism and making him part of the problem rather than the solution. Worse, despite a good feel for the genuinely stunning landscapes, it all too often comes down to a fight over a hut where Beowulf really doesn't do much anyway.<br /><br />If this were an essay on the poem it would get an easy F for its almost complete inability to understand what the source material is about, but changing the substance of the original to its polar opposite - pagan religion good, Christianity a bit of a giggle, Grendel the oppressed minority, Beowulf discovering his inner New Man and the odd bit of political correct guilt tripping thrown in for bad measure - is the least of its sins. It's not the easiest of epic poems to read in any translation, let alone adapt, so changes are the price of a screen adaptation. The trouble is they're so odd and often absurd, more unintentional comedy than magical realism, the sort of mixture of off the wall philosophising and pulp plotting Ed Wood might have turned out if he'd had a bigger budget and a decent second unit cameraman.<br /><br />The f-ing and blinding interlaced with 50s-style heroic direlogue is increasingly comic. There are odd non-sequiters, like the hand that reaches out of a fjord to grab at Beowulf which goes completely uncommented on, or Eddie Marsan's Oirish priest suddenly foaming at the mouth and falling over for no apparent reason as if the last page of the scene never turned up and they had to do something, anything to end it. And then there's the bizarre clash of accents, albeit on broadly tribal grounds (Scots for the Geats, Scandanavian for the Danes). It seems a bit unfair to single out Sarah Polley for her undisguised Canadian accent if she wasn't just so out of place in the whole thing as the whore-turned-witch. Giving her dialogue like \\"No thought of my ****, then?\\" only aggravates matters long before it turns out she had a one-night stand with Grendel and has a little monster of her own.<br /><br />Sometimes the humor is dry and sly enough to pass but at times it's positively Monty Pythonic: you keep on waitingfor Philip Whitchurch's deeply unimpressed fisherman to start talking about strange women lying in ponds distributing swords being no basis for a system of government or thinking that Skarsgard and Marsan have been possessed by Graham Chapman and Terry Jones when the subject of Christianity is raised - \\"Christ, eh? Heard of him. He ever have much luck with trolls?\\" \\"Oi'm ov da fort dat dey nivva crossed parffs.\\"<br /><br />Ending on a would-be post-modern note with one character dismissing the evolving `bastardized' poem as excrement, the claim might have carried more weight if this film wasn't simply a runnier version of the same.

B000TEUSJU|3.0|As usual Amazon have lumped all the reviews of the different versions of this film together - the four disc UK PAL 'Imperial Edition' this review refers to, the one-disc uncut version, the one-disc cut version, the three-disc US version, the BluRay (which includes the uncut version and the extras but not the alternate cuts)...     What to make of the notorious Caligula? It's not really porno, not really an epic, not really a drama - it's just a kind of Mulligan's Stew of a movie. The film is a mess and exists in lots of versions, with the three on the UK DVD not even covering half of them. The hardcore sex in the infamous unrated cut that was added by producer and Penthouse magazine owner Bob Guccione (who looks like a blinged up 70s Caesar in the accompanying documentary and who made the film as a tax deductible write-off against Penthouse's publishing profits) after shooting was finished has surprisingly been left uncut by the UK censors. Yet for all their publicity value, the porn inserts are more distracting than arousing and curious for what was intended as a mainstream commercial porn film because there's such an awful lot of male nudity in the unerotic unsimulated sex among the extras that it makes you wonder what team the producer was batting for.     Despite legend, they're not the sole reason director Tinto Brass and writer Gore Vidal disowned the film: the former did so because much of it was re-edited out of sequence after he was fired in post-production, the later because his script was changed so much (Brass ended up with a `principal photography by' credit while the only writing credit is `based on a script by Gore Vidal'). The original intention to make a more historically accurate and defiantly pagan Roman epic outside the studio system without the restrictions of a PG rating would be better achieved more than a quarter of a century later with HBO's Rome, while at the time it looked like a pale shadow of the BBC's noticeably much lower funded but infinitely better written I, Claudius. Unfortunately Malcolm McDowell wanted to play Caligula as an anarchist destroying Rome from within rather than just another madman - a potentially intriguing interpretation - but pointedly didn't want to do any gay scenes despite playing a bisexual. The producer was more interested in the box-office potential of an X-rated epic. It was never going to end happily for anyone concerned...     It's not exactly historically accurate, but then with Caligula running a close second to Nero as cinema's favorite mad emperor and most surviving accounts of his reign highly partisan, that's perhaps not too surprising. Caligula was actually one of the most popular Caesars with the public in his lifetime, initiating major reforms that made life better for the plebs while increasingly frustrating the senate and aristocracy, who had been running things their way for years in Tiberius' absence and didn't like suddenly being second best. The first two years of his reign were something of a golden age: the economy boomed, he started no wars, caused no major disasters and killed surprisingly few people, none of them members of his immediate family (a bit of a rarity for a Caesar), and even reintroduced democracy and instituted tax cuts and civic building programmes. And when his behavior did become more questionable, it was generally the upper class who bore the brunt of it rather than the unwashed masses. Indeed, so extraordinarily popular was Caligula with the people at the time of his assassination that attempts to restore the Republic were thwarted by mass demonstrations of public anger.     While there's general agreement his reign deteriorated after a near fatal illness and mental illness, most of the worst stories of his madness and perversion come from Suetonius' gloriously gossipy Lives of the Twelve Caesars, written 80 years after his death, so it's probable that despite his promiscuity the stories of incestuous relations with three of hissisters and the more outrageous acts of insanity that captured the public imagination for centuries may not even be true (it was fairly common practice to highlight and exaggerate earlier emperor's failings to make the current incumbent look better, something Suetonius would have been well aware of as the Emperor Hadrian's secretary). Indeed, even the name Caligula is something of a misnomer. He ruled as Gaius Caesar Germanicus: Caligula was a childhood nickname given to him by his father's troops meaning `bootikins' or little boots (caligulae), and its use after his death was a good way of belittling him as a figure of infantile ridicule as he became a victim of the same negative political spin that he himself pioneered against his predecessor, Tiberius. He was certainly a very flawed individual: paranoid, promiscuous with both sexes yet sanctimoniously moralistic, theatrical, mentally ill (possibly as a result of neurosyphilis) and often unnecessarily combative with little realpolitikal acumen, though they're not uncommon qualities in rulers (you could almost see him as the ancient world's King Ludwig of Bavaria). He wasn't a great Caesar by any standards, but he wasn't a particularly bad or monstrous one compared to many that followed him either, and he doesn't fit any standard definition of a tyrant. But then, given the choice between a flawed mentally ill reformer and a raving tyrannical madman, authors and filmmakers have always opted to print the legend. And with Caligula, they finally got the chance to film all the mucky bits the censors never would have let them get away with in the 50s and 60s.     It does have a car-crash fascination, though, and you can see the film it once wanted to be from time to time, as well as why it went so wrong. You'll have McDowell, Peter O'Toole (made up like a lecherous Albert Steptoe ogling his `little fishes') and John Gielgud speaking elegant Gore Vidal dialogue while extras play with themselves in the background, often inshots taken from completely different parts of the movie. It's shot on huge stages that are part Las Vegas (you almost expect Siegfried and Roy to turn up doing the floor show), part grand opera, with proscenium arch staging to match. Part Fellini-wannabe, part Visconti-wannabe, the over-riding impression at times is that it's the kind of film King Ludwig of Bavaria would have made.     Despite all the excess the $17.5m budget could buy back in 1976 and the odd grand image like a giant mourning cloth slowly floating down on the whipped and cowering senators, it's not exactly a grand spectacle - the film rarely leaves the Palace, though there is one vivid street scene where play actors depict the Roman class system as a human pyramid with the people sandwiched between the army and the slaves at the bottom and Caligula angrily trying to bring the whole edifice crashing down. As the film progresses, he becomes more dedicated to chaos, reducing the senate to baaing like sheep after they make him a god, using their wives as whores, all the while thinking they are mad for approving everything he does. \\"I don't know what else to do to provoke them,\\" he laments at one point. Yet the film never seems to have an especially clear idea of what it wants to do or where it's going, the several years (!!!) it spent in the editing room and the uncredited rewrites during the nightmarish shoot all too apparent as it lurches along like a slightly distracted drunk caught somewhere between having drunk too much but still not quite enough.     The four-disc Imperial edition DVD available in the UK offers three different cuts of the film, none of them a director's cut. The first disc has the uncut X-rated version re-edited by Guccione, the second, described as an alternate `pre-release version,' an attempt to reconstruct something similar to Tinto Brass' original intentions that puts scenes back in their proper chronological order and drops some of the more gratuitous sexual footage suchas Penthouse Pet Lori Wagner's lengthy lesbian scene, and - only in the UK set - a peculiar 102-minute R-rated cut from 1999. This short version isn't so much edited as hacked ruthlessly as if someone took it upon themselves to whip the uppity film into submission once and for all. It's not just the jarring and clumsy removal of most of the violence and the softcore as well as hardcore sex, it's the sheer nonsensical nature of the editing that strikes you. Cutting far more than the censors required - nearly an entire hour - it loses many of the film's most memorable and important moments (the humiliation of the newlywed couple, the fever that causes Caligula to believe himself a god and causes his sister's death), leaving the remnants often laughably bizarre nonsequiters or just plain confusing. Some of the cast in the credits are nowhere to be found in the UK version.     The set is certainly loaded with extras - three audio commentaries on the `pre-release version,' trailers, 79 minutes of home movie footage of the shoot, stills galleries and two early draft screenplay by Vidal among them. I know that sounds like saying you buy Playboy for the articles, but they are sometimes more fun than the film. The 48 minutes of deleted footage on the alternate version is deceptive - it's actually raw footage, much of it not even assembled, all mute and only about half of it in colour. Aside from one sequence of Caligula making love to his sister, the shots are either alternate takes of scenes in the film, trims or alternate angles of deleted scenes that feature on the UK edition's third disc. None add anything to the film, although the clumsily staged raw footage of unenthusiastic extras fumbling their way through the orgy at Tiberius' retreat and abruptly stopping every time they wrongly assume the camera is no longer on them does show how difficult it must be to shoot a decent sex scene.     The third UK disc includes another 31 minutes of deleted material taken from wornwork prints that aren't included on the US DVD, including raw footage of the depravities in Tiberius' grotto and an additional 11 scenes in rough cut form, most of them cut from the latter section of the film after Drusilla's death that would have given the film a wider view of Caligula's reign and do show the much more ambitious but no more successful picture intended - much of the film's last third hit the cutting room floor on all versions, as did much of Helen Mirren's role. Unfortunately many of them simply aren't very good or don't quite work, such as Caligula avoiding raising taxes by theatrically setting himself above Jupiter and liberating the god's treasury, a scene not helped by awkward sped-up moments. Other scenes, such as the emperor replacing the heads of statues of the gods with his own head and rehearsing the camp march he makes the legionaries do at the imperial brothel, no longer have full sound and tend to spotlight some terrible work from John Steiner that would have undermined his character had they remained in the film. But McDowell's interest in making the character more of an anarchist comes over in a scene where he playfully plans famines and sea battles to liven things up while nimbly walking over desktops, makes his horse a senator to undermine the ruling class and appeal to the people and a lengthy bedroom scene with Helen Mirren about the dangers of goading and humiliating the senate. Without them, there's less of a sense of his continual emasculation of the old ruling class by piling on outrage after outrage building up to the point where his assassination becomes inevitable. There's also striking footage of his horse being chased by slaves as he dies twitching in the film's final scene, as well as the conclusion of the `Death Machine' sequence where he has his guards throw Proculus into its path only for him to survive.     While a new documentary about the making of the film could be fascinating, the accompanying one-hour documentaryon the DVD dates from the film's release, though it's hard to tell who it was made for since it includes a lot of hardcore footage that would have kept it off even cable TV. Sadly there's no input from Vidal, who sued Guccione to have the film retitled Gore Vidal's Caligula and then, on seeing it, sued again to have his name taken off, nor is there the infamous spoof trailer for a remake he, Mirren and director Francesco Vezzoli made in 2005. Director Tinto Brass, one of the Penthouse Pets who is now a living monument to Cher's plastic surgeon, and Italian schlock-fixture John Steiner (openly admitting most of his films are crap and he's no interest in seeing Caligula) do contribute lengthy interview featurettes, what I've heard of Helen Mirren's audio commentary is fairly good (though nothing thus far to match her onset comment that \\"It has an irresistible mixture of art and genitals in it\\") but Malcolm McDowell's commentary is definitely the big attraction here - at one point he even pauses mid-anecdote to compliment Teresa Ann Savoy's naked derriere!

B002ZG9788|4.0|At the risk of not so much swimming against the tide as against a tidal wave, I thought the much-despised 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans was a terrific entertainment that managed to improve on many aspects of the now much-loved but itself initially disparaged Ray Harryhausen version. For a start it's barely a remake, sharing only the title and the subject matter, discarding the love story and family-friendly elements for an altogether grittier and bleaker view that's at least more true to the cruelty of Greek mythology even if the details aren't so well served.<br /><br />If Sam Worthington's Perseus is a throwback to the typical beefcake hero of 50s peplum, the script at least is smarter than the average mythological adventure. Instead of than fulfilling a divine destiny, this version's demi-god Perseus - half man, half-god, all-Ocker - is raging against it, determined to defy the gods as a man. These gods are cruel and parasitic, dependent on the worship of men to fuel their immortality but unwilling to earn it, their arrogance sparking a war with the mortals who don't want them any more. Rather than taking a Richard Dawkins \\"there is no god\\" approach, this is more of a \\"the gods exist and they're a right bunch of bastards\\" attack, with the dawning realisation that they can ultimately kill them by denying them their prayers. The film does copout on this with the end used in the film, the Blu-ray offering an alternate but poorly executed original version that saw Liam Neeson's Zeus and Perseus still very much at loggerheads, and by losing the love story between Perseus and Andromeda it does lower the stakes somewhat. Perseus' quest is now fuelled by pride, arrogance and defiance, with an impressively bitter Mads Mikkelsen and his high-testosterone expendable Argonauts all manly men meeting manly deaths at the hands and claws and tentacles of mythological beasts.<br /><br />The beasts themselves are generally a pretty impressive bunch, the CGi faring much betterin the original 2D than in the clumsily converted 3D version released in cinemas. If Ralph Fiennes' Hades is better as a special effect than when overdoing the Uriah Heap routine in more human form, the impressively rendered giant scorpions, multi-tentacled Kraken and the serpent-like Medusa grab the limelight over some of the old favorites from the Harryhausen version: Jason Flemyng's Calibos has less to do this time round while Pegasus simply conveniently appears when needed without needing to be tamed in a rather lazy bit of deux ex machina. But then this is the kind of film where the human cast are mostly sidelined as well, actors like Pete Posthlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Danny Huston and Polly Walker turning up for a minute or two as little more than walk-ons and most of the gods having nothing more to do than stand around a disappointingly designed Olympus whose exteriors are spectacular but whose interiors look like Las Vegas car showroom. But it keeps moving without feeling too chopped up and thankfully there's a minimum of shakeycam or MTV overediting to accompany the overdose of testosterone. Big on spectacle and short on charm, it's a very different animal to Harryhausen's film (there's even an injoke about that version's irritating mechanical owl), but as long as you're expecting that it's one of the better action adventures of recent years.<br /><br />DVD buyers get short shrift yet again, with nearly all of the extras reserved for the BluRay release - 10 deleted scenes and alternate ending, 11 featurettes and additional picture-in-picture featurettes running throughout the film if you choose `Maximum Movie Mode' - which has a generally excellent transfer.

B003EYVXXW|2.0|Alejandro Amenabar's Agora is a classic example of Litmus test cinema. If you're an atheist, its unchallenging affirmation of your non-belief will probably endear it to you mightily and guarantee you'll give this review a 'not useful' vote without reading further. If you're a Christian, the film's unequivocal belief that your faith is not only destructive and irrational but the root of all evil and ignorance for the past 1500 years will make you hate it and give this review a 'useful' vote without reading further. If you're an agnostic or simply objective, you'll just wonder not only why it's all so simplistic and ineffectual but also so remarkably dull with it. Because for all the cries of brilliance from one school of thought and damnation from the other, Agora is nothing more than a technically impressive but emotionally unengaging Christians versus pagans epic that aspires to be a thoughtful allegory of scientific inquiry versus religious fundamentalism but instead tends to be very vague and confused when it comes to religion, which is a real problem considering the subject matter, and increasingly dull, which is an even bigger problem.     It does offer novelty value in reversing the traditional Biblical epic and having Christians metaphorically throwing pagans and Jews to the lions with sadistic abandon in 4th Century AD Alexandria as the Roman Empire starts to fall to pieces, but it's all a little half-baked and woolly-headed to pass muster as a thinking man or woman's epic and too relentlessly so-so to work as entertainment.     Stuck in the middle and supposedly standing for reason is the idealised figure of Hypatia (Rachel Weisz, the actress you call when Kate Winslett is busy), a philosopher-astronomer-teacher whose words of wisdom fall on increasingly deaf ears because, as a woman, she's despised by the bloodthirsty radical Christians and, as an atheist, is regarded as unsuitable for public office by the pagans (well, at least in the cut that premiered at Cannes in 2009, though that scene is notably missing from the shorter version that was eventually released to theatres).     Although the film doesn't try to entirely impose 20th century values on its rather one-dimensional heroine - she takes slavery for granted and the science is appropriately 2000 years out of date - it does have a rather confused attitude to what she stands for and why we should admire her. She espouses brotherhood but has no empathy, responds to shows of affection with humiliation, uses others merely as a sounding board for her own brilliance while ironically, and presumably unintentionally, being portrayed as something of a second-rate thinker. With her actual works long destroyed (by Muslims rather than Christians a couple of centuries after the events in the film), her quest to unravel if or how the Earth orbits around the sun may even be a misrepresentation of her work in an attempt to present her as an earlier Galileo and further the myth that science and religion are completely incompatible. The film certainly misrepresents her as an atheist when it seems she was a pagan to simplify the story's central conflict into one of empirical evidence versus blind faith - having her worship graven images might have taken some of the shine off her credibility for modern audiences, and it would never do to have a flawed heroine.     Instead, it paints her as an atheist Christ dying for the sins of Deists, and one whose wisdom all reasonable men (there are no other female characters) bow before. And how \\"How naïve I was. How naïve I was,\\" laments one former suitor-turned-prefect when she points out the errors in his let-the-Christians-kill-the-Jews-and-that'll-be-an-end-to-it policy. Even her father's final scene is an \\"I should have listened to you\\" mea culpa after his ill-advised response to a Christian act of provocation results in the besieging of the Alexandria Library. If only they'd have listened to her, the film seems to be saying, all ofthis could have been avoided.     It's a role and a film that desperately needs an exceptionally charismatic and inspiring star performance to compensate for the many flaws, but it doesn't get it. With little real dramatic meat to work with, Weisz generally chooses to play the part by alternating between two expressions, her serious look and the head girl enthusiastically giving the school lecture on prize day, and a two-note performance in a one-dimensional role that never develops makes her a weak centre for the film to revolve around (Amenabar is big on revolutions and circles in the film's visual scheme). We're only introduced to her emotional dilemma - that to give herself to a man means the loss of her freedom to think and to teach - through her father (Michel Lonsdale), and it really doesn't seem to bother her until one brief scene near the film's end. She's far too in love with her own intellect and the heavenly spheres.     Unfortunately her character seems to be made all the weaker by the one-note villainy the film extends to the evil kill-crazy Christians. Ideologically and spiritually these black-clad crazies stand for nothing - they could just as well be Indians or Zulus or insects from Starship Troopers (and boy, does Amenabar love his sped-up aerial shots making them look like busy ants). They're simply empty-headed black-hearted villains out to kill everyone, with Saint Cyril portrayed as such a Satanic figure that all that's missing is the forked tail and pitchfork. Even a Christian lifelong friend and devotee like Synsesius is inaccurately turned into an enemy opposing her ideas or right to offer counsel to men. It's those kind of broad brushstrokes and lack of historical context that perhaps hurts the film the most, with the film offering no idea of how an empire that had previously been tolerant of most religions changed so violently any more than it shows how a religion built on turning the other cheek and forgiving your enemies became so violently militant as it abandoned pacifism with a vengeance once it became Romanised. One early scene does briefly address the appeal Christianity had to the poor and the under class - a religion that you didn't have to be born into, that favored the weak over the powerful and which found joy in giving rather than receiving - but it's a brief moment that's never pursued in the final cut. Instead it's a conflict between the nasty black togas and the good white togas, with little explanation of what either faction really stands for. Only in the final scenes does it threaten to address the conflict between constantly questioning science and unquestioning religion, by which time it's too late to summon up much interest.     (The longer version that premiered at Cannes in 2009 to such a poor response was a little bit more balanced: you saw the Parabalanos acting as intermediaries in street disputes, feeding the poor and burying the dead rather than just acting like Christ's stormtroopers, the Christians were themselves more firmly divided into two opposing camps, the pagans more aware of the coming storm and, crucially, Max Minghella's slave was seen as being as interested in being seen as an equal of his mistress as her lover, if not more. Unfortunately none of those scenes - included on the Spanish DVD and BluRay - were enough to add more than the most superficial of window dressing to the film.)     The digitally recreated Alexandria and the massive sets filled with thousands of extras are often impressive even if used more as scenery and the occasional battleground than a centre point for the film, and after the first half the film conveys no sense of the world around its few characters. It doesn't help that these characters seem to be made out of cardboard, not least the men who are either weak-willed or evil, a problem magnified by a number of poor performances from some weak actors. Max Minghella's once-loyal slave briefly threatens to become more interesting than hisdull performance as he realises that he has no value to Hypatia beyond what practical use she can make of him, but that simply manifests itself as turning in a Christian-Bale-in-a-bit-of-a-moody impersonation as he becomes a Christian stormtrooper on gaining his freedom. Oscar Isaac's performance as the equally ineffectual suitor and prefect seems to be driven by thoughts of what Rufus Sewell would do in his place and Rupert Evans' Bishop Synesius cuts a particularly pitifully unconvincing figure. Only Ashraf Barhom's Christian martyr offers a genuinely charismatic performance as a man whose joyous belief exceeds his understanding and leads him to do terrible things in the name of divine love. As for the other female characters - there aren't any. Weisz and the odd extra with a non-speaking walk-on in the odd street scene is yer lot.     Even as a purely visceral spectacle, the film feels curiously soft even in the midst of all the bloodletting. Rather than get in the thick of it, Amenabar would rather seem to be above it all, quite literally. Massacre of innocents? Cue celestial overhead shot accompanied by contractually obligatory wailing woman on the soundtrack courtesy of Dario Marinelli's surprisingly clichéd and dreary score. Suitor pouring out his heart through music? Cut to the slowly turning Earth seen from space. Rise of fundamentalism? Cosmic zoom ahoy, Cap'n! As yet another shot pointing out the cosmic insignificance of it all appeared, I just found myself wondering if he'd bought a job lot of outtakes from Carl Sagan's Cosmos. But no - the credits reveal he'd actually bought a job lot of stock footage from NASA, which presumably explains the presence of the Suez Canal and the Assuan Dam in Fourth Century AD Egypt, which the FX boys forgot to paint out. But then, in a film that takes as many liberties with history as this does (the film not only ignores the esteem she was held in by many contemporary Christians but even portrays Synesius, who defended her intellectual achievements, attacking her `blasphemous' scientific theories as if in a bad school production of Galileo), maybe they thought it didn't matter?     In one of the film's better lines, Hypatia tells a Christian that his new religion has yet to prove it is any better than the old ones. Sadly, this is one peplum that, for all its technical window dressing, really isn't any better or more clearly thought through than the average confused and superficial Italian fight-for-Christ peplum of the 50s. And a lot less fun.
B003UESJHO|4.0|As much as New York,Eastern or New England/Boston Accents are annoying(Boston:\\"Get in the Ca'.\\" as oppose to \\"Car\\"),and apparently it seems all the girls are Gingers and smoke and look like American Chonga(Or Hoochie) versions,the movie should not be passed over,Christian Bale(I am A method Actor! \\"I will smash your Lights\\")and Marky Mark Er Wahlberg play convincing roles on a sad but nonetheless great tale about two brothers(although the real brothers look like nothing like this)one picked a bad path another a good path,It's about Family, I don't like the fact the Girl wants to separate the guy from the family even if they are \\"Gab'Age\\",(Ironically the same girl from talladega nights and the Same Whitesnake Here I go again Reference!)In the end everything works out despite the tumultuous and cautionary tale,An overall good film.

0312360258|4.0|As soon as Zoey Redbird gets marked she knows her bad day has just turned to the worst. Her Mother and Step father try to push religion on her when all she really needs is to get to the House of the Night where Fledgling vampyres go after they have been Marked. Her Grandmother a cheekoee native eventually gets zoey there but not before Zoey's Mark is blessed by the goddess of the night Nyx. Zoey is special and she soon finds out just how special. Zoey's mentor at the House of the night is their High Priestess Neferet who has powers of healing as well as an affiliate to cat's. As Zoey enters this new world she makes many friends. Stevie Rae is Zoey's roomate and a sweet cowgirl that becomes Zoey's new best friend. Shaunee & Erin are the Twins only because they act so much alike they just had to be seprated at birth and Damien is super smart and the one guy view they have on their side. Along with these friends Zoey also meets an enemy- Aphrodite(The Hag from Hell) who she just so happens catches doing something very naughty to the hottest guy ever (Erik) in the hallway on Zoey's very first day..how embarrassing!! eck... Erik is a total drama boy geek but even if he does belong to the Sons of Darkness and is Aphrodites ex.. he totally melts Zoey's world and he seems like the one person she can talk to who understands. But the first amazing thing that Zoey notices is during the Full Moon ritual which Neferet performs she learns she can feel all 5 of elements no fledgling are priestess for that matter has ever felt All 5!! This storyline reminds me alot of the Nightworld series, with spirits, ghost, & Vampires you can't go wrong. Some parts dragged alittle for me in the beginning of the storyline but when intresting twist happen with the students who die from the change I was completely sucked in I can't wait to read the second one to find out!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Finnaly I came acros something that works.  Since my childhood I have been on some kind of a diet regimen.  Throught out the years I have cut out so much food from my diet and ate oatmeal 3 times a day.  I did different types of exercises on my own and at the gym.  Nothing worked for me.  Being that I have hypothyroid disease I claimed my slow hormones for it.  This work out DVD not only works your but off but gives you free access to Jillian's website.  You have to use this oportunity.  It gives you meal plan, excercise plan and hundresd of healthyand delicious reciepeis. It has been only 5 weeks and I lost 12 lb- not bad for a person with hypothyroid slowing your metabolism down.  If this works for me it will work for you.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|This is an odd movie, in that it has serious flaws, but manages to be interesting anyway. Denise Richards, for instance, seems to be stoned throughout her performance. She behaves like a half-wit, but is supposed to be the smart one. I found her painful acting-wise, despite her beauty. The story itself wasn't too bad, but there are many spots where most people would say \\"Oh, come on!\\" like when the guy rides the bug around. I expected to see a cowboy hat and hear whooping. In addition, no real reason was given for doing much other than nuking the bug enemy, no reason for infantry to be involved at all in the early battles. The ships clumping up tightly and running into each other when all of space was empty was comical as well. Still, the cool feel of a fascist effort to defeat a grim enemy was cool, and some of the battles were cool too.
B002Q9MZF6|1.0|I bought this opera because I am a fan of Anna Netrebko. The DVD was sent by Amazon UK. I was very disappointed when I found I could not play it, possibly because of \\"regional coding\\". I would like very much to get a copy that I can play, but I don't dare buy another copy from Amazon. I have been unable to find a way to contact Amazon about this matter. The Help pages have been no help at all! Amazon, you have let me down.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Its a good deal and I couldn't pass it up. It took a little longer then the estimated date expected but the movie is soooo good that I didn't even care. It took almost a week longer but it was worth the wait!!!!!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Best cd I could've ever spent money on. I love it and listen to it religiously too. Enjoy every song on it. Its perfect for any type of mood too. Thanks so much.
B004SBX112|1.0|It won't even get passed the loading screen on my Sprint HTC Hero.  Granted it's an older Android phone, but it should at least load.  Angry Birds Rio DOES load but gets about 4fps so it also is unplayable.  I'm just \\"collecting\\" the free apps as they come out in hopes that someday I will upgrade to a phone that will actually run them.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|I will NEVER try or recommend this app, I hate your old navy ad, your marketing is the worst ever. great work making people despise your brand.
0756404738|4.0|I read the first book, Name of the Wind, and I was hooked. I waited a year for this book to come out, and I was not disappointed! When I saw how long the book was, I thought \\"Wow, that is worth $30.\\"     Most of the book was great, although it did have it's slow times, and I am thankful they didn't try to make an extra buck by splitting this book into 2 parts.    Worth the money and the wait!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories (Black) bag, and didn't arrive the bag. When this bag arrive, How long I wait?!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game to play and waste time to! Downloaded while in the dentist waiting room and it made my 45 minute wait not seem so long.
B004LFO0ME|4.0|Legit stuff from Wiz. First time I've heard of this guy since he went mainstream, so I thought I'd pick it up. Definitely worth buying.
B0040JHXTS|3.0|If you're like me, you absolutely loved when Bruce released the 4 disc Tracks box set. Finally, all those great songs that he had kept in the vault were to be released. Much of it was marvelous vintage Springsteen.    I had the same level of anticipation for this set. I was disappointed (mostly).    First, the CDs:    Disc 1: the Darkness album. Chances are you already own it. You know it is incredible. I do not need to tell you why.    Discs 2 and 3: Oh the level of excitement I had when popping these in. Finally, non-live versions of Fire, Because the Night, and Talk to Me...not to mention early versions of songs that would later morph into well known classics. I'm sad to say that the bootlegs and various rare live captures of many of these songs are much better than what it is presented here. The material isn't bad by any means. By and large they're decent songs, with a couple of really good ones, but they just feel...wrong. Many of these songs don't sound like 70s Bruce very much. There has been a lot of processing, overdubbing, and re-recording in some parts. The result often ends up sounding like demos that have been polished. Frankly, I'd prefer to listen to raw and gritty demos than the halfway blend of original and remastered presented here.    All that being said, it is of course, wonderfully informative from a historical perspective.     I won't go into the documentary here, but the highlight of this set is the concert footage from the 70s. It is glorious, vintage 70s Springsteen and well worth the price of the set alone.
0061997811|5.0|This book came to me in excellent condition and was filled to the brim with wonderful stories and keepsakes from the making of the movies.  I love knowing how things work, and this really whetted my appetite for more investigation and reading on the subject.  This book explores the \\"making of\\" without being boring and too technical for us laypersons.  Wonderful book.
0446619078|5.0|I just re-read this book for the second time -- something I rarely do -- and still think it is Connelly's master work.  I won't rehash the plot --that's been done -- but will only say that both readers of suspense and fiction in general will find much to love in this book.  For regular readers of Connelly, in this book you finally begin to really \\"get\\" LAPD detective Heironymous Bosch.  Connelly is a gifted writer who draws a very human portrait of the ultimate tortured hero, the ultimate man of principle, and just writes a darn good tale.  Loved, too, all the secondary characters, especially the psychologist, and enjoyed the historical backdrop of the earthquake.  And as usual, the end has quite a twist so if you think you've got this one figured out . . . maybe not.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|This product worked excellent with my setup.  I have a new iMac and a older video camera, (JVC Digital Video Camera)  and the 800-400 worked great with my DV cable, and iMovie.
B000SEFEHW|4.0|If you are an experienced leader, you can skim this book in less than an hour and refresh your memory on aspects that will help make you successful in your new role.  As another reviewer said, the book is worth the investment relative to the potential reward.  There is only one piece of \\"new\\" information I'd like to add to this review: You might be tempted to purchase the Kindle version of the book.  That's what I did.  The book hasn't been formatted well, however, for ebook readers.  I read the book with the Kindle reader on an iPad.  In many instances the diagrams and indented text were hard to read - sentences overlaid each other on the screen, and diagrams were garbled.  If you are a first-time leader and want to read and digest the entire book, you probably are better offer with a paper copy of the book ...
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Amazon error, download again! I don't understand why this hasn't been addressed yet. plus there hasn't been an update yet. Can't give it a good review if i can't open it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This is on EVO Shift. The game works fine and is good, but every time I exit from it HTC sense has to reload. also the 25 word minimum on this is stupid.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|i thought this story was amazing i love my gory killer scary books but my imagination got the best of me on this one i really could feel how this little girl felt i think this has to be one of my favorite books ever
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Mama Mia is a great invention of arranging ABBA music into a story. The result is a movie  that will make you smile as much as Chicago.
0670022411|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish.  I give it five stars because it exceeded my expectations in terms of literary scope, was highly entertaining, and... Well, essentially it was just a great read that left me wanting more and very glad to learn that it's the first in a series.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|I like this album better than the last one and I think that AA are really on top of their game right now (Andersson is flawless on drums and Hegg sounds excellent). I can't wait to seem them live in May!  \m/  This is also a great deal because the \\"Bloodshed over Bochum\\" performance is included on a separate DVD - all of this for such a low price is a great value for the fans!
