B002Q1YDLI|2.0|Something Blue was a well written book but my main problem with it was the central character, Darcy.  She was so shallow and unlikeable that it was difficult for me to sit through the 20 chapters I read of her self-centered whining, conniving and complaining.  I kept waiting for her to show some depth or growth.  I wanted to see her evolve as a person. I know people like Darcy exist.  I know she is representative of a certain type of woman who relies on her looks to get her through life.  Emily does a great job of showing who Darcy is at the beginning of the book but she doesn't show her experiencing any growth as a result of her hardships throughout the book which it makes it difficult for me to connect with her as a character and I never did.  In the end I was tired of her and had to put the book down.  I also didn't see the nuances of emotions that one experiences during pregnancy.  I remember that time in my life and all Darcy thinks about is shopping and how she will keep her weight down.  Are there women out there that are really this shallow?  It's hard to root for Darcy.  I found myself wishing that I could hear more from Dex and Rachel than her.  That's how much I disliked her.<br /><br />So I went back and finished the book because I felt it unfair to judge Darcy without seeing if something happened to transform her.  Sure enough she suddenly changes and becomes the person that I wanted to see evolve throughout the book.  I just thought it was too sudden.  She finally connects with her pregnancy.  She starts being kinder, etc.  I was happy with the final outcome. Not a bad read after all.
B004PHE9F6|3.0|One star for the movie itself, 5 stars for the image quality for a 3 star rating.  There are 3 bravura racing sequences in this film, with some amazing angles and impressive cinematography.  But the rest of it is mediocre at best.  It's unfortunate that director Frankenheimer (who has made some outstanding films) didn't spend as much time on the script as he did figuring out how to mount cameras on the Formula 1 cars.  The characters are flat, and the cast is unable to breathe life into them.  The soap opera situations are laughable, and it's impossible to root for anyone.  The score is abysmal: Maurice Jarre recycles phrases and orchestrations from Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia; he basically composed one theme which is played to death in several variations.  The sound mix on the Blu-Ray is a mess -- the levels jump all over the place.  Finally, the movie is full of 1960s gimmicky split screens and optical effects which completely take you out of the film -- it's Michael Bay, 1960s style. Grand Prix was an \\"event film\\" in 1966, and it's like so many other event films: bloated, noisy, and soulless.  This one doesn't even have an A-list cast.  Rent it, watch the opening race in Monte Carlo, the British race in the rain, and the final race at Monza, and don't waste the other 2 hours of this overlong turkey.
0345803485|2.0|After all the hype about this book, I bought it and immediately upon arrival, began reading it.  Much to my chagrin, I feel it reads only a bit better than a cheap romance novel.  I do not recommend.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is an absolute delight of a read! Rachel Joyce is to be commended for this novel. It's delicate, wise and deceptively well crafted. Don't miss this reading experience.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The first in the series, this book is a perfect balance of sci-fi and realism. With a little bit of love thrown into the mix also. I absolutely loved this book and would highly recommend. It's fast moving and easy to read. Purchased the second book straight away!! Was my favorite of the series, but was quick to purchase the other two. Haven't yet see. The movie, but I'm looking forward to it even more  now! I hope they do Suzzane's characters justice. One of my favorite books I've read : )
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am really enjoying having a different kind of puzzle to solve. If you like thinking and reasoning puzzles this is for you.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The middle part in the series played out exactly as that. It was the perfect join between the first and third books. There's a rollercoaster of a love triangle and enough action to keep you going. With the introduction of alot of new characters in this book the writer does amazingly well to have them leaping off the page! I loved it.
B0086700CM|5.0|all the haters that don't like this game are just hatred this game is so addicting I let my daughter try it and now she won't let me have my kindle back lil awesome
B005EGXTL2|4.0|As the lastbook in the series it had alot to live up to, and didn't dissapoint... Still fast paced and a surprise on every page. This book was a little different to the other two but tied it all together well. It was a perfect reflection of the changes of the main character throughout the series. Something about the ending had me feeling a little unsettled and without giving anything away I was hoping for more. However, still a great end to a fantastic series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Amazing game you are never bored because there are tons of games to unlock and play. You can always replay the games and try to best your score. Lots of different challenges are what keeps this app fun. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|thank you for making this available on the kindle fire love it!!!! I have been waiting for this to become available for a long time!

0913866156|5.0|This deck is by far not only my first incursion to Tarot but my favorite so far. The cards are so well thought out and their meanings are defined not only by their traditional divinatory meanings but also by the artwork. So far I have come to depend on others' interpretations of the cards but am developing the intuition to interpret or discern the meanings of the cards. The primary spreads I have used are the simple 3card-PPF spread and the Opening of the Key Spread (OOTK) which is by far the most detailed and hardcore spread one can undertake. It is one that is more sequential rather than positional (as found in Celtic and pyramid spreads). Most of the information I have attained by the OOTK is derived from Paul Hughes Barolow's websites (newtarot.com and supertarot.co.uk) and his book \\"Tarot and the Magus.\\" These are some of the spreads I have sought to master, all in time I guess. But the deck is by far accurate, calming, and can be used for meditation (as with the Haindl).<br /><br />A matter to clarify is that I have noticed many people speak of an inherent negativity associated with this deck. To this I may add that a cleansing should be carried out for any deck after its initial purchase. In addition, I feel it is a matter of will to overcome the eeriness present in the cards. Barlow has stated that each card represents some spiritual entity, Liber 231 for Major Arcana, Goetia for the Numbered cards, and Enochian spirits for the court cards. Perhaps one is thus attuned to one of these beings but for my experience I have not felt any presence when working and otherwise with the deck. I do hope that the reader would be more informed of these matters and that one should not be carried away by the designer's reputation or the cards themselves.<br /><br />My primary use is for meditation, as a means to commune deeper into one's self and understand the forces that we are constantly interacting with in the world. I could include a list of readings that I feel contribute greatly to this understanding, such as Barlow's books and some works of Crowley, but it would never suffice. I suggest, in short, the process philosophy of Whitehead, Jung's archetypes, the work of Lacan on the role of psychoanalysis (much can be read further in the cards with Lacan), Deleuze's rhyzomes, Merleu-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Prigogine's End of Certainty, the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, spirituality of Sri Aurobindo, and Jodowersky's Holy Mountain, as perverse it may be, it and on youtube his video on the Tarot elucidate the true meaning of the Tarot, which is not simply for fortune-telling, but a tool that is used for self-development and increasing spiritual intuition. As varied as these insights are, I feel they are constructive with one's sense of development. Nonetheless, these are the influences that have aided me. As Bruce Lee would say, \\"have no limitation as limitation, no way as way.\\" The Tarot integrates well with my philosophy and spirituality, but as a word of warning, do not become ultimately dependent on it, such as throwing down for little matters. Rather, use it in moderation, such that every instance contributes to your self-realization.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I see why a lot of people got it.It so awesome. I like the dart one first it is easy .Then it got harder.Get it.
0553807919|5.0|Book was in perfect condition and is easily understood by the laymen. Great explanation for children and their parents. Have used this in my work.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was waiting for his game for soooooooo long. I went on my kindle to see the free app for the day and I saw it was Temple Run. My mouth literally dropped and I started jumping up and down. This is one of the beat days of my life!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a fun easy and cute game. works great for kindle fire!!!!!!! :) love the movies. the little characters look exact.
0374275637|5.0|I got a well-rounded college education 40 years ago.  Everything in this book is more recent than then, plus it covers a number of topics that are neither covered in your typical \\"college eduction\\" nor commonly discussed in the press.  This book is not philosophical, esoteric or metaphysical.  In readable language easily understood by perhaps a college sophomore or junior, this book covers and relates a number of shortcomings in our natural thought processes.  It's information and understanding that we can really apply in our professional lives and in our personal financial management.  While there were a few of these biases that didn't seem to apply so much to me on account of my professional background (casualty actuary), almost everything else in this book described me -- and most everyone else -- to a \\"T\\".  Read this book.  It's interesting and it's practical.
B0086700CM|5.0|at first they faked me out with temple rum. then they got the game temple run and I was so happy because I have been playing it on my sisters ipod and now I have it on my kindle
B003V63VNI|1.0|I bought this album because I have been an Incubus fan for about 12 years.  It took me a while to actually get it after its release date, as I usually wait for albums to get under $10 before purchasing on Amazon. :)  Anyway, I bought it, ripped it to FLAC and finally sat down to listen.  FOR THE REST OF THIS REVIEW I AM GOING TO TYPE IN CAPS SO YOUR EYES START TO HURT - THAT WAY IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE ALBUM TWO OF YOUR FIVE SENSES WILL BE OVERLOADED.  I RAN THIS ALBUM THROUGH REPLAYGAIN AND WAS APPALLED TO SEE HOW LOUD THIS ALBUM WAS....ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SMALL CLIPS I PREVIEWED DID NOT SOUND LOUD - THEY SOUNDED ALMOST ACOUSTIC-Y.  THE DISORTION ON THIS ALBUM IS SECOND TO NONE - IT'S A THIRTY FIVE MINUTE ALBUM AND I'VE GOTTEN A SMALL HEADACHE AFTER LISTENING FOR AROUND 10 MINUTES.  IT'S AMAZING TO ME ANYONE WOULD EVER RELEASE AN ALBUM THAT HAS THIS POOR OF SOUND QUALITY.  THE MUSIC DOESN'T SOUND BAD AT ALL, BUT THIS IS THE WORST MASTERED/PRODUCED ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD - WORSE THAN CALIFORNICATION BY RHCP, WORSE THAN DEATH MAGNETIC BY METALLICA.  YOU CAN'T GET PAST THE WALL OF DISTORTION AND EVEN ATTEMPT TO ENJOY THE ALBUM!  I WOULD HAVE OPTED FOR A RETURN, BUT I BOUGHT IT A FEW MONTHS AGO AND AM OUTSIDE THE RETURN POLICY WINDOW.    FOR FANS OF MR. BRANDON BOYD - PLEASE UNDERSTAND I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE I AM FAN OF HIS AND OF INCUBUS.  I'M NOT TRYING TO BASH AN ARTIST I LIKE, BUT THE LOUDNESS WAR HAS TO STOP.  TAKE A LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING THREAD I FOUND ONCE I GOOGLED THE ALBUM TO SEE IF OTHERS THOUGHT THE SAME AS ME:    [...]    IF YOU BUY THIS ALBUM, DO NOT TURN THE VOLUME UP AT ALL, OR YOU WILL RUIN YOUR SPEAKERS.  AGAIN, IF YOU THINK I AM EXAGERRATING, PLEASE READ THE THREAD I POSTED ABOVE.  MR. BOYD, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. RE-ISSUE THE ALBUM IN A LISTENABLE FORMAT.  END THE LOUDNESS WAR!!!!
B00126J6HE|1.0|The picture depicted here is not the rare lp. The rare LP is not a tan label. Nor does it have a circle on the cover. This appears to be the Canadian black vinyl which could be purchased on E-bay for one tenth the amount shown here. Therefore I can not sell my USA black vinyl here because it is not the identical one shown here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was so sucked into this book.  Just finished reading it for the 5th time. It is very erotic.  Took a while to get into the \\"good parts\\" but was worth the wait.

1609613937|5.0|I have following the career of Dr. McDougall for over 10 years and find him to be quite credible.  Two of my clients have attended his 10-day live-in program in California and were able to get off MANY meds in that short amount of time.  This book explains the myths that are perpetuated in our society regarding animal protein, calcium intake, fish oils and more.  He also explains how the same group that supports agri-business (the USDA) is also the group that produces the nutrition guidelines for America; there are so many conflicts of interest that prevent the government from telling us the real truth about which foods cause disease.  Thankfully, because of doctors like Drs. McDougall, Esselstyn, Campbell, Popper, Barnard and more, we can learn the real facts, and make informed decisions about our health and lifestyle.
B005ZUR724|1.0|just spent money on this stupid game waited for it to download and it wont even connect to tthe server... haven't been able to play it at all... don't bother buying it. I will take this down if the problem gets fixed and it better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The writing was smooth, there were not outlandish spelling or grammatical mistakes. That in itself should give it at least 2 stars among Kindle books. And the plot moved along, made sense and was well thought out.<br />Don't read this if you are claustrophobic! Everyone else: it's a very good sci fi story.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally we got temple run for the kindle now all we need is instagram and I'll be set for life
B007OAAK0O|5.0|this is what time it is. long after you peaked or were in your prime, however you can rock a stage with your hits all love and no autotune or enhancers and all the way live  plus in the rain.  Diana Ross throws down on this concert which is a education to alot of these acts who don't know how to handle business on a stage. Diana Ross gave a classic performance and did all of her hits and thensome.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've never played nonogram puzzles before, but the design of this game is super user friendly. The only con is that there are very few easy levels to let you learn the game if you've never played before.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good game u should try it.  its very fun.  best game in world. I think I will play it some more. yeah for me.
1400052181|4.0|This book started off strong. I've studied biology in my final year of high school and chemistry in my second-last year. I've always loved how humans are made up. That being said, I'm not a scientist nut or a nerd. I read mostly fiction or fiction-writing guides. This has been my first non-fiction book since A STOLEN LIFE by Jaycee Dugard which I read late Nov/early Dec 2011.<br /><br />The content of this book relating to Henrietta Lacks herself is shocking, amazing, and heartbreaking because she's always been abused in the sense that her image was unknown to all those who performed experiments on her cells or benefited from the medical developments. Author, Rebecca Skloot has done a great job of writing this book for the general public when much of it could have easily been heavy biology/scientific jargon. Overall, most of it was easy to understand, easy to read and thrilling.<br /><br />However, this book is split into two parts. Two storylines that work together throughout the book. One is Rebecca Skloot's journey in getting to know the family, interviews/research, and the other part is Henrietta Lacks and her family.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book \\"gave it all away\\" too soon. By midway, I learned everything I wanted to know, and I actually put this book down for a short period and read something else in between. there was no tension or secrets I was waiting to hear how they panned out. Basically people plodded around for the last 40% or so. Disappointing.<br /><br />In the end, I didn't read the last two chapters because I didn't think I'd miss out on anything anyway.<br /><br />I want to stress that Henrietta Lacks changed our lives. This book is all about her suffering, biology and how she revolutionalised health and disease cures for everyone today. You MUST know the truth of HeLa. However, read this book knowing that the excitement/tension drops off and the start is much stronger than the ending.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Simply a master piece.<br />Musicals are the most powerful means of entertainment and this one has been one of the best compilations ever by one of the most iconic R. N. R. bands. So I'll take off my hat for it.<br />In few words a classic.<br />However, I acquired a Mexican copy recently in a chain store, and although, they cover all standards of a well manufactured item, the one I got was missing the disc two booklet. But anyways, nothing is perfect.<br />Another piece of jewel in my video collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally the Kindle Fire has Tempe Run in its app store! I have been trying to get this for a while and now I got it for FREE. I love playing this on my Fire :)
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting for temple run available for kindle fire for the longest time like ever i love this game soooooo much (: yay
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its fun works great on my kindle fire its just hard enough to keep you playing and not be boring
B0086700CM|5.0|I've waited so long for this game to come out. Some of my friends have it, and it looked really fun. It ended up being really awesome! And what makes it even better is that it's FREE!! (it's $1.00 on some apple devices)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. I love all the reading plans it offers as well as the different Bible versions; this app makes staying in the word much simpler, would highly recommend it to others!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This was the best game to ever be created. its addictive and fun, and you never want to not play.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|These books are trash yet one can't stop reading them.  It's repetitive in context yet keeps you wondering if something is going to happen and never does.  I'm half way through the second book and I'm not picking it up a often because I know that it's going to be boring.  I want to finish them so I can go on to something else.  I don't want to waste my money.  Does this review sound strange?  Well, you're right but that's exactly how these books make you feel. STRANGE!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad this app is finally available for my fire!!!!!!! The game is filled with total awesomeness and you should get it!!!!
B005FFW46S|5.0|I have no clue where all the moaning is coming from. There aren't as many laughs as some of the other books, but Pratchett was never just laughs. That's why he's brilliant: under the guise of base comedy, Pratchett weaves stories of sin and greed and adventure and action and character and redemption and strength and grace.<br /><br />This is one that has all that in spades.<br /><br />There's a moment in there where even our beloved liberal Vimes has a turn around when he realizes that there is always some crap you inherit from society's past, and it's great.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the swelling pride, the tearful moments, and the just rewards in Pratchett's books: this one's for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game was organaly made for the apple iphone and iPod.  But they came out with it for a kindle fire!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game a lot.  Very easy to navigate.  Don't need Wi-Fi to play.  You can always win with this game.
B004USRKX8|5.0|Every song and instrumental on this album is a unique and stimulating piece of work, backed up by a cast of some of the most creative and brilliant musicians of the place and time: Garcia, Lesh, Hart, Kreutzmann from Grateful Dead, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and members of Jefferson Airplane, among others, congregate to make an album heavy with earnest desire for good music, creative and idealistic camaraderie and to help their friend David Crosby at a time when he was grieving from the loss of his closest girlfriend from a car-crash.<br />After the semi-spontaneous, bongo acoustic hippie jangle of, 'Music is Love', with Neil Young joining on vocals, guitar, bass, vibraphone AND congas, is the gritty and funky, almost \\"Stoner-Rock\\" sprawling epic: 'Cowboy Movie', with great, subtle but striking lead guitar from Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh on bass, Mickey Hart drums and Bill Kreutzmann on Tambourine! And it's a strong platform for Crosby's powerful singing.<br />The album begins to mellow considerably, with slow, haunting songs and some beautiful, broody ballads, broken up by an all-in, all-star chorus, protest-like song 'What Are Their Names'.<br />Concluding is an a Cappella piece exclusively sung by David who said that its genesis began quite suddenly and mysteriously during a session, when he started overdubbing and layering his voice in faithful harmony, ending quickly with a one-take finished product of moving and haunting success.<br />This is a solid, often stunning album from start to finish, and a monument of the times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First book I've read by this author and with this one book he is on my list of favorite authors.  Read it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is very good I play it everyday whenever I can. it was one of the first free apps I downloaded for my kindle fire. keep up the good work mobilityware.
B0086700CM|5.0|so I have been waiting for this app to come on amazon loveeee it it finnally came and I could play this forever
0345803485|1.0|After hearing friends at work go on and on about this book, I just had to read it. After doing so, I can't believe I actually got through it. (Well, most of it; I did skim over some of the tedium.) The characters are paper thin. The plot is non-existent. And the writing is repetitive to the extreme. I truly think I might have a negative reaction of some sort if I ever again read the words \\"murmur,\\" (Speak up!)  \\"blush,\\" (Get a grip!) or \\"gasp\\" (Shut your mouth!). I believe this author had 50 pages worth of text and duplicated it 10 times.<br /><br />I just have to add that Christian's character was too soft for my romantic spirit. Why was he gasping every other page and getting the vapors like a little girl?
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this game on the ipod but now that it is on the kindle fire it is way better, the graphics are good and the tilt sensativity is great! I highly recamend this app for kindle fire
B0035JRVBO|1.0|Amazon prime instant video had very grainy images. Very poor video quality. I have always enjoyed the movie itself, but I just can't watch it through the instant video option because of the poor streaming quality.
B0086700CM|5.0|so FUN! I Sony know what the heck is wrong with the haters they have no sense! Well awesome game!<br /><br />(5star)
B004T2QZL8|4.0|THIS APP IS AWSOME I TELL YOU! There's just on problem, I can't play it! It won't let me! It keeps saying, \\" Get the full version now!\\" Or something like that.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so amazing and fun and I am glad the game is out so everyone start the game
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's good but I wouldn't get it<br />it deleted all my progress at&quot;wave15&quot; .It's addictive but I wouldn't get it.If it didn't have that glitch it'd be AWESOME!
0811879542|5.0|My Daughter loves this book!  Every night she asks for it!  I think she likes the interactive aspect of it.  I highly recommend this book for young children!
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Finally -- a film about spies that does not treat its audience like morons.  This film takes a challenging -- but wholly rewarding -- book and turns it into a movie with the same attributes.  The acting is great -- the direction is subtle and a great deal of fun.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who thinks the Mission Impossible movies are obtuse!
B007L96SI6|5.0|This is the first time I have ever deleted my review and rewritten one.  THIS CD IS WORTH THE EFFORT!  When I first listened to it I gave it four stars and it was on a very lazy Memorial Day morning.  I instantly loved Spiderweb and of course acknowledged Haley was hot but that was about it. Spiderweb is by the way on the bonus cd and an absolutely KILLER song; the best by far on the whole CD.  THIS CD IS REALLY REALLY GOOD!  For instance, Wasted Tears blasted loudly sounds incredible!!  It's a really catchy awesome tune!  The songs are excellent; and some need a second listen to fully appreciate, in fact, I think every listen will find a new nuance..her voice is so special!  Haley is beautiful inside and out.  I have said this about Crystal Bowersox and it is also true of Haley Reinhart..there is brilliance in Haley's blood..this CD certainly had it's share of phenomenal moments however the next CD Haley does, if it surpasses this one.. WILL SPLATTER BRIGHT RED BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE!!  Haley has a sexy soothing cool hot and incredible vocal and looks the part!!
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting all this time mabye like a year for a great app like temple run and then here it comes!the great free app for me!temple run!dont waste your time getting all of those other apps, get temple run!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|wonderful controls and amazing graphics. Mario for the kindle! the touch response is very precise and makes gameplay fun and enjoyable
B003O86FMW|5.0|a great book i could not put it down all three books in the collection are a must to read
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Another interesting retelling, this movie covers the arc in the manga that introduces Asuka Langley Sora. It also introduces another new character, but I don't want to have spoilers here. Suffice to say that this movie diverges from the series a great deal more than the first movie does. The quality of the visuals and the voicework are both in my opinion excellent, both in the Japanese original and the English dub.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Provides a somewhat intimate view of the mindset of Jobs, without justifying his negative characteristics. A great book if you are interested in both jobs and the underlying reasons for Apple's success.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|... if you think this starts out exactly as a better processed version of the original series, because you're right. But as the DVD continues it slowly and subtly diverges from the original. Some character development is lost with the secondary characters, especially Shinji's classmates. Nevertheless it is a good, tight retelling of the mythos with some subtle changes for the better as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited sooo long for this app. All my friends with iPods constantly play this game. Android was smart to make this an app. I mean, it did average five stars. I can't seem to stop playing it. It's simple with a nice little plot. Anyone can play it, but you have to practice to be good. I would easily recommend this app to anyone. Get it, it's worth a shot.
0345803493|2.0|I seriously paused reading this book just to write this. I am struggling so much to finish this book.  If the author is going for making a character the most unlikeable person in a book ever, then she has won with Ana Steele.  Perhaps this is what the author was going for the make your emotions strong with the piece but instead of making it positive she purposely made it negative.  Anastasia has to be the most immature twenty something year old ever.  She acts as if she is 14 or 15 and it is mind numbing and greatly annoying which is why I am having so much trouble finishing the book.<br /><br />If you choose to read this book please be prepared mental for LOTS LOTS LOTS of repetition in words, descriptions, mannerisms and character dialogue.  Its bothering me soo much but I want to finish the book since I have already started.  I was ok with Book 1 even though it was too much sex, so I said I will read the trilogy, but as I am struggling to finish Book 2 I have sadly decided I will not be reading Book 3.<br /><br />As I stated if the authors intention was to evoke negative emotion of a character then Bravo, well done, if not im sure most of you will find Anastasia Steele the most immature, annoying, insecure, dawdling, woman child to ever has graced the pages of a novel.<br /><br />A LITTLE SPOILER:::::<br /><br />I have stopped at the point where she ran from Jack. I mean how many times does Christian have to tell her not to use the work email. I mean seriously I take back what I said earlier, Ana does not act like a 14 year old she acts worse than a 5 year old. I have taught 2nd grade before and I never had to tell them...my 7 year olds... not to do something so many times repeatedly right after one another. The emails go on for pages and in every email its use your blackberry use your blackberry and she acts as if he has said nothing. I for the life of me can not figure out why the author chose to have her constantly ignore the angry plea's of this all consumingchristian grey she loves so much asking her not use the work email.  I hope it was not purely to set up that Jack and Ana in the kitchen scene because the author could have done so much better. This was the final straw for me which is why I had to pause.<br /><br />I am also greatly annoyed with the constant writing out of the email exchanges. I mean ..omg...if I want to read through pages and pages of email correspondence I would look at my own.<br /><br />LITTLE SPOILER OVER:<br /><br />Now that i have finished this review I am not sure why I even wrote this as these books will still continue to give the authors gobs of cash, and have many readers because everyone is caught up in the hype. I only hope that when these turn into movies that the screen writers make Ana a more likable and have her behaving more  age appropriate
B0086700CM|5.0|Finnally the best game in he app store has mad it to the kindle. This is a fun addicting game that everybody should play. I love temple run!!!!! btw for the guy who said minecraft is better then ur a nerd who plays with a electronic all day. get a life!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I downloaded this book because I had heard alot of great things about it.  I found the Amazon Kindle app on my phone and wanted to check it out. I had already watched the movie when I did buy the book, but I would definitely take the short time to read the book. It's quick and easy, and a great love story that build into something greater. You'll become an addict like me and read all three!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I found this book to be erotic and I wanted to read it.  I also found that it was badly written and had holes in the continuity of the story. It was an easy read and one that can be discussed with so many women as it has been read by heaps of women.  I also found that it is not a book for men as the men who started reading it could not finish the book and found it boring.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|let me just say, im not trying to sound like a nerd but, i think i just found my true love! jk. it is a really good game though. :D  u haters can hate but let me tell ya, ur stupid. hate the player, not the game. oh yea, UR THE PLAYER. My brother &lt;3's zombies so around wave 10 or 11, i was fighting the boss and 3 other zombies and he watched me play it and then asked me for the name and now and although i had it first, he &lt;3's it SO much, hes past where i am!<br />peace out! Maddog (my nickname, not real name! cause im insane for one reason! &lt;3 ya!)
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is incredibly addictive. the best part about the game is it being free! the only problem I can think of is once you get to the later parts where there are constant coins everywhere and constant turning the game starts to lag, even on my kindle fire so I will take a star for that.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was one of those people who saw the movie first and then decided to read the book. I had always heard good things about the book, but never had the time to get around it. Knowing first hand that books are way better than movies, i dove into reading soon after seeing the theatrical version of The Hunger Games. This book is truly amazing, and I am actually suprised at how similar the movie version followed the book version. It was hard reading the book at first, knowing what happened in the movies. And I almost cursed myself for seeing the movie first, thinking I ruined the story for myself. But the more I read, the more I realized the book gave me so much more vital, character informatin than the movie ever could. You get deep inside of Katnis's head and really experience all her emotions and what she is going through. The book is so powerful and captivating. I finished it in less than a day. The book gives you detailed information about the capital, characters, traditions, and the games. I also loved how the book got to be a bit gory. .. Something that the movie clearly left out.  Suzanne Collins creates a unique storyline that you easily get emereged and engulfed in. Truly genious, and an absolute must read. Bravo.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I think that Liam Neeson should have turned this picture down. His acting talents are much better than what this movie had to offer. He lost his girl (or wife). No reason to kill himself just before he is going home. You don't find out that she died until the movie is just about over. He's the star so he leads the group. Shotgun shells=stupid. Torches that don't go out=poor writing. Jumping across a very wide cavern with a short start and heavy boots on plus a lot of clothes, without getting hurt=far fetched. Sticks against wolves. Bad odds. I mean, come on man. Get real.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All I can say is WOW. Catching Fire takes place immediately after the Hunger Games and starts off with Katnis going about her life in district 12. As a reader, you know that the Quarter Quell is creping up on the districts of Panem and have no idea what to expect. I dont want to leave spoilers for you, so what I will say is that you will in no way anticipate or be prepared for what is about to happen.<br /><br />What I love about this book is how raw, real, merciless, and shocking it can be. Old characters from the Hunger Games whom readers grew to love are further developed and new characters are introduced and we, as readers, grow attached to them too. There were so many twists and turns in this book. There were so many times where I finished a chapter and just sat in disbelief for a few minutes before I could continue reading. The story is layed out in such detail, and as a reader you never could have imagined how far Suzanne would develop the story. I was shocked to see just how far the capital would go to seek its revenge, and could not believe or accept some of those who were lost in the process.<br /><br />I am telling you right now, do not start reading this book unless you have some time to spare. You WILL NOT be able to put it down. I read this book in less than two days, using every possible free minute I had to fall ifurther and further into the world of Panem. Suzanne Collins does exceptionally in ending the book in a cliffhanger. I literally ordered the third and final bookk two minutes after finishing and became further obsessed with the series. If there was ever a book to read, this is it. Bravo.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is an awesome replication. The game gives great deck options and no lag time. I recommend this game to every Solitaire Enthusiast.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Fun Fun fun .....ggrrrr...... even more frustrating than the others... like the new backgrounds and challenge levels, so much fun on my kindle fire ..:)....:)
B0076UXKDG|2.0|I've been shooting Nikon since the 60's and am fine with paying a premium for quality but this is too much. I'll wait for a 3d party piece. Some enterprising company (probably Chinese) will make a copy that's at least as well made but for a more rational price.<br />(Update) I've been using the Pixel Vertical Grip for a couple of months now and it's been perfect. No weather sealing tho so I have to keep that in mind if it rains.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is just my opinion but this is the best game ever! its finally on the appstore now they just need jetpack joyride. and don't listen to the bad reviews you will love this game
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I am so happy to see this DVD so inexpensive!  Love it!  Will watch it again and again and again!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|great puzzler. Different to any other games on my phone, encourages logical thinking. Fun to play and can be exited and resumed making it good for bus rides
B0086700CM|5.0|My parents have iphones and I always played on their phones (it's addicting). I've been waiting for months for it to come out.  GET IT NOW!
B007SSDS24|1.0|This film is really terrible. On the plus side, it does cover most of the tourist areas in case you ever wanted to visit Moscow. On the minus side, it's really a cut sequence from a video game but with even less character depth, logic and plot.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have done an excellent job in detailing the failures of this film. If I may be allowed to add a crowning failure to trump them all, it would be that the audience does not care about the characters at all. This film reminds me that although I didn't like Spielberg's War of The Worlds or Abrams' Cloverfield, they are basically much more professionally executed in every respect.<br /><br />There are some talented folk in the cast here and they wasted the opportunity. This film is flat-out boring, ridiculous and a repetitive version of better versions that have been before.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally my love app has come to me! this made my night. thanks imangi studios. btw I'm on the toilet Atm.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ever since I got my kindle fire I have been wanting this app now it is finally here I am happy!<br /><br />(Update: For the record, my 11-year-old son wrote this review, not realizing that my name would be associated with it.  But, if you are an 11-year-old boy, this app is apparently the shizzle.)
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it a lot but I wish there were levels and stuff but it goes on forever but other than that is good
B0086700CM|5.0|YAY! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS GAME TO BE FREE ON THE KINDLE! I HOPE THERE WILL BE A JETPACK JOYRIDE
B003O86FMW|5.0|While Catching Fire is not on the same level as Hunger Games, it is deffinately worth the read. The book, overall feels somewhat rushed, but it does deliver as a young adult novel, and soars as a light read for more advanced readers. Happy Hunger Games!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|this version keeps saying that I cannot view or load tweets even after ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it 4 times..... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this book to see what all the hoopla was about.  Quite frankly I couldn't imagine how anyone could want to receive pain - in the name of pleasure.  However, I found the book a quick read and very believable.  Yes, it is very explicit - but the reader knows this going in.  The fact that a relationship develops and is completely believable led me to purchase the second book of the trilogy.  The only part I felt was not believable was that someone who left college could become a billionaire in 6 years - a stretch unless you are Mark Zukerberg.  Storyline flows nicely - I enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|5.0|getting on the kindle and updating was so hard but now i just click and update. thank you amazon. this is one of ny favorit mobile device games and now i have it on my kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great it finnally came on the app stire but I tried to down ok aod it but it said tht it would do it but its still a awsome game. I LOVE IT

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm hooked. Can't go a day without playing a level or two or three.<br /> What more is there to say!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game and was excited when I saw it today. but its laggy and a bit hard to control. hopefully this can be fixed with aand update. I love this game so please fix the lag. now all we need is dragon vale and high school hero!!

B000PC6A3E|4.0|In a pivotal moment in Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne is ordered by his mentor Ducard to execute a man from a small village who has been accused of killing his neighbor because he coveted his land.  Wayne demurs, telling Ducard that the villager deserves to be tried for his crimes before punishment is meted out.  If we merely execute the man, Wayne argues, without a procedure in place to check our baser tendencies for retribution, then the result is not justice but rather retribution.  The question of where we draw the line between justice and vengeance becomes the core theme of Christopher Nolan's first foray into the Batman mythos, and it is a question that seems particularly suited to the character of Batman.  It is also a question that had been all but ignored in the years following the September 11th attacks.  In many ways Batman Begins is the quintessential post-9/11 film that manages to smuggle moral quandaries into a big budgeted blockbuster when the larger discourse surrounding terrorism seemed content to ignore basic questions of justice.<br /><br />Tellingly, the villains of Batman Begins are an international terrorist organization by the name of the League of Shadows and headed by a mysterious character Ra's al Ghul.  It is later revealed that the League of Shadows has been around for centuries and exists to level empires that have become too big for their britches.  But before the League of Shadows reveals themselves as the villains, they first serve as a training organization for Bruce Wayne, a billionaire driven by the death of his parents to travel across the globe in an attempt to understand the world of criminals from the inside out.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most brilliant moves that Nolan makes in the film is to spend nearly half of the movie on the training and origins of Batman.  When Nolan's Batman film was release, it had been nearly eight years since the disastrous Batman & Robin, a film so poorly received that it single handedly killed of the multi-million dollar franchise.  Where Joel Schumaker's Batman & Robin attempted to resurrect the camp and humor of the old Adam West Batman series (although Schumaker's film didn't have one-tenth of the whit of the 1960s TV show), Batman Begins endeavors to shroud the superhero's origins in as much realism as possible.<br /><br />The film cuts back and forth between Wayne's training with Ducard and his lost years dealing with the death of his parents.  In recounting Batman's origins, Nolan decides to include one of the most controversial figures in all of Batman's seventy year history: Joe Chill.  Plenty of Batman nerds (myself included) have argued about whether or not the murderer of Thomas and Martha Wayne should even have an identity.  Those of us who prefer the anonymous mugger version of the story claim that because the murderer is never caught, any criminal, whether it's an everyday bank robber or one of Batman's rogue's gallery, can serve as a stand in for the man who killed Batman's parents.  I've often found myself on the anti-Joe Chill side of this argument, but Nolan's treatment of the character has forced me to rethink my position.  Instead of a low life scumbag who murdered two people for a handful of cash and some jewelry, Joe Chill is portrayed as a desperate figure who turned to crime in the midst of an economic recession.  And his killing of the Waynes looks more like a man who acted out of fear than sadism.<br /><br />By transforming the motivations for Chill's crime, Nolan expands the question of crime from the actions of individual actors to notions of systemic economic and ideological circumstances.  In fact, when the League of Shadows reappears in the film's climax, it is explained that the organization first attempted to level Gotham by leveling its economy, causing the recession that lead to criminals like Joe Chill.  This is an astute account of how terrorism works.  Many forget that one of the chief goals of the September 11th attackswas not merely the indiscriminate killing of innocent people; it was also an attempt to embroil the U.S. in foreign wars in order to bleed us dry with deficit spending.  By emphasizing the economics of crime and terrorism, Batman Begins asks us to question the root cause of violence.<br /><br />The first half of Batman Begins is so well crafted, so methodical in its pacing, that it's almost a shame that Bruce Wayne has to suit up in the second half.  Batman's origins are so compelling that Nolan could have done the entire film without a single appearance of the cape and cowl.  (In fact, I've always felt that a TV series that followed Bruce around the world as he trains to become Batman would be a big hit).  The second half of the film is decidedly overstuffed, and it suffers from a glut of villains, a problem most superhero franchises don't run into until the sequels.  Batman faces off against the League of Shadows, Gotham's crime boss Falconi, and the deranged Scarecrow.  Any fan of the comics has to object to the inclusion of the Scarecrow in this film.  While his psychological obsession with fear and terror fit neatly within the themes of the movie, the Scarecrow is such a strong villain that it's truly a shame he doesn't receive the sole spotlight.  This may be a complaint reserved for comic book geeks, but as a member of this group, I must object.<br /><br />Nolan also struggles when filming action sequences.  He uses so many quick cuts that it is nearly impossible to see what is going on.  At times this is intentional, such as when we are supposed to see Batman's hit and run techniques from the point of view of the criminals themselves.  But there are scenes later on that use the same choppy camera work for no particular reason.  At one point Batman has to fight four different ninjas, which sounds like the coolest thing ever.  But unfortunately Nolan slices and dices the fight choreography, making the entire thing nearly incomprehensible.<br /><br />But perhaps the film's single most glaring misstep is Katie Holmes's tone deaf performance as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend, Rachel Dawes.  Whenever Holmes attempts to be charming she tends to smile with half of her face, which can be downright frightening.  But in her defense, she is given some of the film's worst lines of dialogue.  Even Katharine Hepburn couldn't deliver the phrase \\"Some of us have work to do\\" without sounding like a stuck up prick.  Superhero films have not always been kind to their female characters, and Batman Begins perpetrates this boy's club tradition.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a much more uneven film in its second half than in its first half, but it still manages to meld big summer action with surprisingly nuanced questions of how we understand terrorism.  When Wayne refuses to executed the villager accused of murder, he asks us to question how far one can go with retribution before you become the very object you are fighting against.  How many indefinite detentions, indiscriminate aerial bombings, extrajudicial executions can a nation participate in until it is perpetuating the same kind of violence it has sworn to stop.  Batman Begins proves that when those in the media stops asking tough questions, popular culture can sometimes smuggle them into the public debate under the guise of entertainment.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i dont even c how there cud b a problem with this app. its an amazing app. nuff said .

0307730697|5.0|Fearless is a study in our own fallibility, our strength of will to overcome, the power of heart. Here is the story of a man that came from a humble upbringing and seen by many that knew him as a young man that was special if for any other reason than he had a good heart, a big heart, one that was the first to stand up for the little guy. Like many finding his direction as a young adult proved illusive and he made the all too common choice of getting mixed up with the wrong people. He became trapped in a life of drugs. He was lost, destroying his relationships, any hope for a future, his life. To state Adam Brown's path to becoming a Navy Sea, and ultimate rise and heroism as a member of Seal Team Six, is unlikely and inspiring, is an understatement. When you learn what he was to his family, friends, brothers in arms you will be moved and challenged to BE more, to DO more. As a writer Eric Blehm doesn't insert his political or religious beliefs into the stories he tells. He has demonstrated time and again that along with exhaustive research of his subject matter an ability to dig into the most intimate and quiet details of his subjects. This detail creates a strong connection between the reader and the subject. Blehm tells Adam Brown's story in a way that connects you to him, his struggle, the strength of the human heart, and the tragedy of his loss. This is a powerful story told by a gifted writer. It is a must read!!
B0086700CM|5.0|its so fun every one synod have it if it would freaking load. that's is what freaking amazon should do is to update downloading.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really love this game but it keeps crashing on my kindle fire! What gives??? I wish it were more stable.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar to mario games but i like it. it took me a while to get used to the controls but overall i like it
140123755X|5.0|I suggest this for anyone that grew up hearing fairy tales.  I feel that you should have some understanding of the fairy tales to get the full humor of the book.  I am working my way through the volumes.  Each one builds upon the previous.  Finally!  A great fairy tale book for adults
B0082EFM2C|5.0|I watch Idol occasionally and Haley was by far my favorite singer last season.  I knew that she could make some great music with a voice like that.  This album is awesome and you can hear that the record company allowed her more freedom sound-wise than most of the contestants get.  There isn't one bad song on the whole CD, which seems way too short to be honest.  Undone already sounds like a classic ballad.  I'm not even a person who listens to this type of music much but Haley is an exception.  Check it out
0142410373|5.0|when I was in the third grade, I was the new kid and felt left out and isolated, unlike my instantly popular brother.  Luckily, I happened across the school library and made instant friends with the librarians (which did little to lessen teasing at school).  They introduced me to the magic of Roald Dahl.  I love all of his books, but this one is still my favorite.  Will definitely be reading this to any children (or nieces or nephews) that I may have in the future.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Very interesting life style and how one gal with a lot of guts and determination changed her life. It can be done if you want it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While traveling with only my computer (and no internet) for entertainment, this was fantastic.  It provides action, humor, sci-fi, eye-candy, and many original lines that you can use with other brown coats.  While I am sad that the season was cancelled, this is wonderful on its own.<br />Thanks Joss Whedon for hours and hours and hours of entertainment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a chalange for all. I'm hooked don't want to put it down. try it its great fun and free fun.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am enjoying this game.  very addicting...Sucks you right in.  so far, it has been fun...been playing for a few hours now...

B0086700CM|5.0|my highest score so far is 659.825<br />this game is the most epic game I guess I didn't know TempleRun was on KindleFire :D
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I happened upon the original Wool by chance during its first month in the Kindle store, and I thought it was incredible. Post-apocalyptic stories typically aren't my thing, but Wool enthralled me like nothing else. It moved me to tears and left me wanting so much more. Then I found Wool 2, and I had never been so happy and so upset simultaneously. The series got better and better as it progressed. The writing is beautiful and the story itself is ridiculously creative but somehow fathomable. The omnibus edition should be purchased and enjoyed by everyone. Kudos to Hugh Howey for writing something so genius.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I own both Intel and AMD CPU's for many years. I currently own a 2500k clocked at 4.4 and a 2600k clocked at 4.4 ghz. Both chips are great. 2500k uses a radeon 6870 gpu and the 2600k uses 560 TI's in SLI. I'm telling with no bias that the FX paired up with a 6870 or higher is just as good in gaming. I saw less stuttering on maps in BF3. It was smooth as can be. Also, I had installed both microsoft hotfix patches for this architecture before I installed any games. This chip is underrated. Who cares about single thread performance? It's the same as the Phenom II's basically. Not exactly some major dropoff. Additionally, it is a fact that many software's are tailored for Intel architecture. I would like to see more software geared toward the module architecture. This CPU delivers. A multi-tasking beast for the money. at least 90% of Intel performance with most tasks for a lot less money. Make no mistake, this is a fantastic gaming CPU, music production, VM's. The CPU architecture seems to come to life when you push it. I only have mine running at 3.8 on stock voltage and it runs great.    Anyone who hasn't, download the patches. Sure it's only 1-5% improvement but it's better than nothing.    [...]  [...]    Bottom line this chip gets the job done, even if it's not as fast as my other chips, it feels quite the same in most respects. Windows 8 scheduler will utilize the architecture even better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have ben wating 4 this game 4 a lllloooonngg time and it is soooo great. but it has a few glitches that some times make you fall in the water. but like I say miner.get this game get it nnnnnooooowwwww!
0060793333|5.0|Michael York performs this story beautifully. Each character is distinct and enjoyable, and the narration, even the long, descriptive passages, is engaging. The only drawback is a slight volume difference between narration and character voices, which is only a minor nuisance in the car stereo. I still give it five stars.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am addicted it is a good game. It reminds me of Super Mario Bros. I haven't encountered any problems yet.

0307730697|5.0|I've read at least a dozen true war stories (Lone Survivor, Horse Solider, Unbroken, etc., etc.) but none packed the wallop that this one did. This one speaks to so many different areas of life...family, country, hope, faith, courage, commitment, ...it's just unique in its many messages...without being one bit \\"preachy\\" or overboard in its presentation. This is honestly the first book I'd like to buy in bulk and give away to every young (and old) person I know (maybe by Christmas the paperback edition will be out and I'll get my wish!). The phrase \\"must read\\" was invented for just such a book as this!!
B007SSEBCU|4.0|I've always loved Maggie Thatcher, and this depiction was very well done. Meryl played her slightly more shrill than I remember her being, and she reminded me more of Hillary Clinton than Maggie Thatcher, but overall this was very well done. A nice stroll down memory lane for some of us who miss the days when we had real leaders in this world.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is amazing. i use it for school in all my classes. even Geo to draw my shapes. its so easy

B007SNMVH2|5.0|Great action, great acting, great story. A wonderful escape from reality. They've left it open for another sequel, which is great news. I won't spoil it by revealing the story, but if you liked the previous installments, you'll like this one!
B003WKOU0G|4.0|I haven't seen anything but the trailer, but it seems very very charming and I am sure I will love it when I watch it.<br /><br />I just want to make a comment for all those people whose reviews I'm reading who are trying to shame so-called developed world parents for being more protective of babies than parents in places like Namibia. Yes, babies are \\"not made of glass.\\" But as romantic it may be to fantasize that we are too protective and worried about children, please keep in mind that the infant mortality rate in Namibia is about 46 per 1000, versus less than 7 per 1000 in the United States (which is actually high compared to some other developed countries).<br /><br />Please note that I am not passing judgment on parents in Namibia or anywhere else. There are good and bad parents around the world, and it would be ridiculous for me (or anyone) to stereotype any culture, country, race, or other grouping of people. But I do believe that many protective measures that parents take are really for the good, and are not unnecessary. Yes, there are overprotective parents out there - and yes, there are underprotective parents out there - but when I read these reviews I get the sense that for some people watching the movie validated their own prejudices more than enlightened them.
B0086700CM|4.0|its the same game we loved to play on apply products. the power ups are great and make the game interesting. the only problem is the occasional issue with the game recognizing the direction of a swipe. for instance, if I would swipe left the guy would jump rather than turn. this doesn't happen all the time but when it does its frustrating. all on all this is still a great game that everyone should download.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very entertaining! My friend had it and I have been waiting for a while! It was definitely worth the wait!!
0061703087|4.0|As other books from Crichton, \\"Prey\\" is a page turner with a thought-provoking theme.  Programming algorithms such as the swarming algorithm relies on decentralized, evolutionary algorithms simultaneously running on a huge number of agents.  These algorithms may lead to totally unexpected, even uncontrollable behaviors and extra caution must be exercised.  This message is clear and valuable.  And it was delivered through a breath taking story of various complex characters.<br /><br />From the technical point of view, I think that are some fundamental technology holes that compromise the whole theme.<br />1. The complex behaviors of the nanobots require high-bandwidth communications between them, in order to coordinate their movements such as simulating a person's face.  It is impossible to achieve a network with billions of nodes, while each node is simple enough to be assembled by some bacteria.<br />2. Given the power limit of each communications nodes (the nanobots), such communications must be very easy to jam.  Therefore, the swarms can be dispersed or disabled by simply jamming the inter-nanobots communication.  Yet no such attempt was discussed in the book.<br />3. The reproductivity of nanobots is a key feature supporting the idea of adoption and evolution.  The book describes a scheme where the nanobots facilitates the spreading and multiplication of the E. coli, which in turn produces more nanobots.  The second step is questionable.  Production of nanobots not only requires the assembler that is produced by the E. coli, but also the various materials and a controlled environment.  For this to happen outside of the lab facility and even inside human body, we need a lot more coincident events than what is in the \\"Jurassic Park\\".
0439023513|3.0|\\"Hunger Games\\" and the follow-up sequel \\"Catching Fire\\" are page-turning reads because they are able to capture our imagination through a combination of adventure and angst. I felt that \\"Hunger Games\\" was the better of the two, because, while any many ways disturbing, was more of an adventure tale. \\"Catching Fire\\" retained many of the key ingredients, but started to focus increasingly on the political sentiment and angst within Katniss. Finally, we have Mockingjay, the third part of the trilogy, and while there are some dramatic moments they seem to get lost in loathing and anger expressed by Katniss.<br /><br />  In some ways it is subtle, but the end effect is that \\"Mockingjay\\" is a much slower read, and at times you begin to doubt if you even care about the final outcome. Truthfully, \\"Mockingjay\\" probably should have left about 100 pages on the editor's floor (mostly in the first half of the book). Better yet, \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\" could have been combined into a single book. I think this could have helped with the flow of the entire triology... but hey that is just my opinion.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned it, but I feel that Suzanne Collins missed an opportunity for a literary home run with \\"Mockingjay\\". While this story does serve as a tidy conclusion (i.e. there are not many loose ends that were not tied up) it does not seem totally satisfying.<br /><br />One thing that may be worth noting, \\"Mockingjay\\" on its own does not hold up as an independent book. Meaning, if you want to read \\"Mockingjay\\" you will need to read the first two books of the trilogy.<br /><br />Final Verdict - Not much to say here.... if you read \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" I doubt if you will pass on \\"Mockingjay\\". Conversely, I doubt anyone will decide to begin reading the trilogy strictly based on the reviews of \\"Mockingjay\\".<br /><br />3 Stars
B008578PRK|4.0|Four stars because it did drag on a bit, but the acting was flawless and the suspense was palpable. Even my dog was at the edge of his seat. They actually managed to surprise us with the ending, something rare these days. I give it a double thumbs up, but be prepared to be scared out of your wits.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I get out to the theater to see a movie about once per year; I'm now a slave to the Blu Ray home entertainment era. However, I did something this Memorial Day weekend that I haven't done in over 20 years: I went to the theater twice in 2 days (with my kids) to see [[ASIN:B001KVZ6HK The Avengers]] and Men in Black III. And neither of the movies let me down; both were excellent.<br /><br />While The Avengers is getting high marks from the critics, I am very surprised by the so-so reviews that MiB III is getting. I'm glad that I went to the theater, because the abundance of \\"just average\\" reviews might have even deterred me from putting MiB III in my rental queue. I'm here to say don't be deterred.<br /><br />MiB III was almost as good as [[ASIN:B007ATNHLI the original]] MiB (and the original MiB was classic), and MiB III was better than [[ASIN:B00198X0VS MiB II]]...wayyyy better. The best part for young audiences that may not have seen the predecessors from 15 years and 10 years ago respectively, is that MiB III stands alone as a great movie....There's no need to have had to have seen either of the first two in order to fully enjoy MiB III. Although it does help mainly to see how effectively awesome Josh Brolin is at capturing the essence of Agent K that we all know as Tommy Lee Jones; and I suppose that it also helps to establish the dynamic of the bond between Agent K and Agent J (Will Smith).<br /><br />So MiB III is a fun blast from the past...or should I say blast into the past. In 1969 Agent K maims, arrests and has bad guy Boris the Animal thrown into an intergalactic maximum security prison...on the moon. But 43 years apparently gave Boris a long enough time to figure out how to escape. But escaping is not all that's on Boris' mind; he jumps back in time to 1969 to change history and murder Agent K. So when he succeeds it's up to Agent J (Will Smith) to jump back a little further in time to stop Boris.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, Josh Brolin really makes you believe that you're seeing a young Tommy Lee Jones, or should I say young Agent K. The personality differences and dialogue between Brolin and Smith are amusing to watch, and some of Smith's scenes with and without Brolin are out-and-out hilarious.<br /><br />Comedy Writer Etan Cohen (not to be confused with popular Writer/Director Ethan Coen) teams up with MiB veteran Director Barry Sonnenfeld to deliver a movie that's funny, witty and fun for the whole family. At a run time of just over 90 minutes I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />So do indeed get out to see Men in Black III; at minimum get it into your viewing queue. For me, it will be preordered, viewed again on Blu Ray, and sit in my collection next to MiB I & II.s you believe that you're seeing a young Tommy Lee Jones, or should I say young Agent K.

0810994739|5.0|I bought these for my 10 year old grandson. He was having some problems reading in school. this was a great series to get him to practice. It worked too. He is doing great in his reading class at school.
B0086700CM|5.0|When I found out that this game came to the kindle fire I was so excited!!!! This game is super fun and even more fun on a bigger screen!!! I love TEMPLE RUN!!!!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|All about purchasing ingame currency to play.  Sick of this model.  Let me play a few levels unhindered to see if the game is worth an investment.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great fun for all ages and you can play anytime for just a short amount of time also you can earn new things pretty quick without spending real money.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has been out for awhile  now. What are people talking about finally? Yes this is a awesome awesome game but finally?
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game. The first couple of puzzles eased me into it and now I am hooked. I love the fact that it takes some good old-fashioned logical thinking to solve the puzzles, not any advanced knowledge.
B0086700CM|3.0|I was extremely excited when I opened the app store to see templerun. Not so excited after I played it about 5 times. It began to be extremely laggy, past the point of even being able to enjoy playing it (I'm not very bothered by a little lag, usually). Very very sad about this.
B0086700CM|4.0|Who are they kidding? White guys cant run that fast!  fun game but kinda lags.  wish there were other levels or something.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it lets u choose the verse chapter and book I read it every day u can get an account and bookmarks highlight and much more get this app
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was very interesting and was very easy to read. Good summer reading. I would recommend it as well as the other 2 in the series.
1594203334|4.0|I finally got to the top of the list for the library book. This was a really good book. I had low expectations after reading so many bad reviews and negative newspaper articles. I thought it was just going to be a lot of whining about how badly behaved American kids supposedly are. What it was was an outsiders view of another culture, focusing on how children are raised. So she's an American married to a British guy who is a sports reporter based in Paris. She had been a foreign correspondent and they met while on assignment somewhere. So anyway, they get married and she moves to France. They had a daughter and then twin sons, all born in Paris. The book covers childbirth differences, 98-99% of women have epidurals, the only hold-outs being \\"crazy Americans\\" (the doctor's words) and French women who don't make it to the hospital in time to get one. And she talks about the difference in attitudes about breastfeeding, what to eat when pregnant and how soon you have your pre-pregnancy body back (three months). She had her two deliveries in different hospitals, one private and one public, so she talks about those differences. She points out that her American and British friends and acquaintances all ask how her twins came about (she was on Clomid) but her French friends don't. Although my guess is they speculate plenty in private. She said twins are actually pretty uncommon in France. The government pays for up to six rounds of IVF but they usually only implant one or two embryos so they don't have an artificially high number of multiples like we do in the states. Knowing you have plenty of chances to try before you have to pay for it they aren't under the same pressure to have success the first time. (That's my comment, not hers).<br /><br />She also talks about daycare -- creches that are deemed an important experience for children to have. Interestingly enough, French creches are the original daycare, it spread to the United States (and I guess other countries) later. Pre-school is free and she finds it odd that kids don't learn to read until first grade. Odd for current times, I guess, but I didn't learn to read until the first grade.<br /><br />She talks about autonomy for children and how important the French think it is. She notices at the parks the French moms let their kids roam and play independently (unless they are wobbly beginner walkers) where her American and British friends follow their kids around and engage with them more. \\"Awakening\\" and \\"discovering\\" are big concepts and something the child does independently. Also, she talks about school field trips. She picked her daughter up from pre-school and saw there was a sign-up sheet for an eight-day trip for children ages 4-11. And the kids go and have a fantastic time.<br /><br />Having lived in a foreign country from ages 6-12 what I thought was most interesting was the couple of chapters where she talked about raising a child in a foreign country. Is she French? Is she American? She's actually raising a third-culture kid but I don't think the author is familiar with the term or the concept. Her husband is a third-culture kid, as his family globe-trotted all through his childhood. I don't think he was even born in England. Something funny was when she took her daughter to visit her mom in the states. Her mom decided to introduce the young girl to American-style macaroni and cheese (presumably Kraft, although she doesn't say). The girl took one bite and said \\"This isn't cheese\\".<br /><br />The more controversial parts of the book were really just a part of the book. She talked about how French babies all sleep through the night (\\"do their nights\\") by three months, eat only three meals a day and a snack at 4:30, sit politely through restaurant meals and eat what's offered. However, it can't be totally universal. The first thing anyone asks a mom of a small baby is \\"Is she doing her nights?\\". She talked to a woman who was working as a night nanny who said her charge was \\"searching for her nights\\". And when she first enrolled her daughter in the creche the director asked what times she had her milk, not just assuming it was 8, noon, 4:30 and 8, the standard schedule. She was demand-feeding and that was a foreign concept to the director. She quotes a lot from the French parenting expert (their Dr. Spock). While there are cultural expectations obviously babies are different and some fit the mold and some don't.<br /><br />I guess I raised a French baby, my daughter who is now 10 \\"did her nights\\" by three months, ate three meals and a snack by a few months, ate what was offered and sat nicely through restaurant meals right from the start. However, only having one child maybe I just had a big case of beginner's luck. Who knows what a second baby would have been like.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good book and I recommend it. It's not a parenting book, it's just a book about raising children in a foreign country and comparing and contrasting the majority thinking in both countries. And the whole thing is well-researched and documented, it's not just all her making assumptions.
B0002HYFEI|5.0|Hesitant to get bigger set for a 4-yr-old, this turned out to be the perfect size, just enough pieces and we can add later. I'd get more marbles (big shooter size work too). Also you need more blocks to build taller runs (one note, Melissa & Doug unit blocks are just-slightly smaller than the haba unit blocks that come with the set, like by a hair, which is a tiny bit frustrating, but doable, just takes some tinkering to make corner pieces flush). We also use things from around the house, like empty paper towel tubes, etc. Lots of fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game on my sisters opossum and they finallly made it for the kindle! everyone should buy this game.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ok, I tried very hard to relate to this character.  Granted, I am about 20 years older than the main female character, so I desperatley tried to remember what I was like at that age.  Would I have reacted the same as she did?? Dear God, I hope not!  I'm not really sure what the appeal is to this book other than the sex, but after a while that even became uninteresting.  I found myself skimming over them!  Holy cow...jeez...oh my!!  Yeah, that about sums up the dialogue in this book.  I did find Christian's story somewhat interesting, but by time you get to it, you're just too tired from all of Ana's repetative dialoge (Holy cow...jeez...oh my)
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome and every one has it on he bus to Dc everyone posed it and cut the rope u would enjoy so buy it!!!!!

B007MJ9LA2|2.0|Carlos is a great player, but he just doesn't have enough variety in his playing to make me want to listen to him for an hour. And, am I the only one who thinks \\"Metatron\\" sounds almost identical to \\"O Canada\\"?
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game so I was so glad when it finally came out. hate those other coppies of temple run.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad they put temple run on for the kindle fire ive been waiting for this insted of that temple rum and temple ruin bboorriinngg.

B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting, get it now. I love this game, could play for hours. Only, I accidentally bought a powerhouse that made the game too easy, but I couldn't get it back to normal. So I thought if I uninstalled and reinstalled, it wouldn't remember, but when I went to reinstall, it thought I still had it and said open where it should say install. I don't think this is the developer's fault though, I think its amazon's. Love the game but sad I wont get to play it ever again:(
B0086700CM|5.0|thank you amazon app store for finaly putting temple run on the kindle fire, thx :), soooooooo happy, know! yayyy
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever. I love this game I cant beloved leave they gots this it was like for ever yes
B004US4K2C|5.0|Best launcher I've tried. Lots of free themes to choose from. I use the stock them which could use some more icons but that would be my only complaint.  Software runs smoothly and is stutter free. Highly recommended for any one who wants to tinker with stock without rooting the phone.
B0086700CM|5.0|people at my school with the Apple products always ask if i have this game... I CAN FINALLY SAY YES!!! :-)

0345803485|1.0|After all the hype, I decided to buy this book. I found the writing so difficult to get through (as in poorly written), I ended up skimming through pages. I kept waiting for the story to draw me in since everyone i know loved this book. Very disappointing.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|you can draw for your friends! how awesome is that!?! try to guess right when you draw for them! have fun!!!
0670022950|4.0|All in all a good interesting book except when the author brings up politics. There he falls into a cliche trap.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can not believe they finally brought temple run to the amazon appstore! I downloaded a temple run from apktops before, then replaced it with this. Thanks Amazon!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run now that it has come to kindle fires I like that it is bigger the. ipods I am also very good at this

B003B96AOW|5.0|I bought two of these. One to display in the case, and one to take out and pose how I want it. Deadpool is hands down the best comic character of all time, and Diamond Select as always nailed it.
B0085E3M26|5.0|OK, maybe I'm biased because I was a fan of hers from the moment she opened her mouth to audition for American Idol! She's got a fantastic voice and I hope she will go on to have a successful career. I've been hearing the first release \\"Free\\" on the radio a lot around here, and there are several others I think would be great singles. I even will go so far to say that I can imagine some of these songs being great on Movie or TV soundtracks! I don't know what the deal is with Music companies releasing \\"regular\\" and \\"deluxe\\" version CDs, but you might as well get the deluxe. If you're a fan, you will like the whole CD!
B0086700CM|5.0|Awsome! There is no better word. I love this game! This game really has good moves and really keeps you entertained. I'm  so happy to find it and its Free! I played it on my brothers tablet and loved it. Yippy now I got it. Great, Great, Great!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love Downton Abbey ....so glad to have it on dvd.  Told my sister and she wanted to borrow mine...no way!  so I purchased it for her.  Good buy and quality
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was great for book one of the trilogy. Definitely leaves you wanting more Christian Grey : ) My advice is to go ahead and have the next two books on hand.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Read all three of the Grey Trilogy in two weeks. Could not put them down. Sexually explicit and erotically imaginative, the basic story line of the underlying causes of the main characters' personalities keeps you turning the pages.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|AWESOME. I love it! Mindanao hard to control because you dash pretty fast. I still give it a 5 out of 5 : )
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Thei ugly tragedy is truly an abommination.  Only a misanthropic director writer-director could have created such trash.  The only question I have is why Liam Neeson would make this film?  He isn't stupid like the film so I guess he must have needed the cash!
B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book takes the meaning of cliches to a whole new level. The \\"bad boy\\" cliche engulfed the entire book and washed any enjoyment out of it. From everyone being scared of Travis to him beating anyone and everyone up to Abby (miraculously) being the only one who can effectively communicate with him, the whole book turned into some juvenile story only a high schooler could enjoy. While reading, I spent most of the time rolling my eyes and chuckling in total disbelief at how corny the book was.<br /><br />The author also has never been to college or has a very poor recollection of one. It drove me insane how the entire student body was so focused on whether or not these two characters were dating. WHO CARES!?!?! I had to go back through the book just to confirm the characters where, in fact, in college and not freshmen in high school. Nobody in college cares who is dating whom! Let alone the entire student body!!!<br /><br />Abby also repeatedly argued about the fact that she JUST HAD to stay at Travis' place because she lost a bet. A bet? Are you serious!?  When did college students turn back into 12 year olds where a bet was legally binding!? Not to mention the OVERLY repeated issues of Abby and Travis fighting. Totaly letdown.<br /><br />I had to end the book at Chapter 11 (because that's when the cornyness really got deep) but turned to the last few pages and read the end. Let's just say I'm glad I didn't waste any more of my time. The ending was absolutely horrible!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally!!!! ive waited so long for temple run to get on the amazon account I'm so excited to be able to play it on a bigger screen!!
B003HESLZW|5.0|This man got soul ! ! !<br /><br />I have a record player, started a vinyl collection...<br /><br />First vinyl: Bob Marley, Legend<br />Second Vinyl: Jack Johnson<br />Third Vinyl: Ben L'once Soul.<br /><br />Is that good !
B0086700CM|4.0|ok well it takes awhile to download. but its a really great game and its fun and addictive but its worth the wait
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game so much. i hav waited sooooooo long had my kindle 4 5 munths now but it finally came. best game ever made
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run finally makes it to the amazon app store.  What took so long! Same addictive action as before and runs well on Kindle Fire. A must have for fans of the infinite runner genre.
B0086700CM|5.0|I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY!<br />I love this game!<br />Must buy game!<br />This message has been approved by me of course TEMPLE RUN RULES!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|This was the best of the Camel Club books I've read. It moved at a good pace and had enough twists to keep me guessing.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is a really fun game I would recommend this game to every one in the wourld it is really great and the grafics a amazing as well
B005EXA8LY|3.0|.. I would probably like this album more. It definitely needs to be listened to the whole way through. A trip you have to take when you are in the right mood and have the time.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|This certainly ranks right near the top of both the most boring and depressing movie I've ever seen. It was painful to watch, and I don't know how I made it to the end. How this had a four-star rating is beyond me. Save yourself.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Like many others, I finally gave in and read 50 shades of grey.  I have to say, I loved the first one.  Was excited to read the second one, but a little let down with it.  It was a good as the first, but ok, I can live with that.  The third?  Was just bad I think.  The characters took a nose dive.  Are the 20 something, or Jr. High kids?  The writting was blan.  I felt like the author just ran out of steam.  And I had no idea what the story was.  It was off in so many different directions. I feel really let down by this one!  I wish I had stopped with the second and walked away happy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play Temple Run on my daughters iPad. I love it I was so happy when I saw it on the app store!!  :)
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have read this series many times over and almost every time I picked up on something I missed before. I am a definite fan. Way to go Ms Karen. :)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's amazing, but a 1 suggestion for extra personalization:<br /><br />1. You could add the ability to display pictures as a background.<br /><br />Also, to really give an awesome alarm, the downloader should also get the FreeDI youtube downloader. Download music by going to youtube on your device, and hit desktop at the bottom of the page for a youtube video or song you like. If this app is installed along with the youtube downloader, you can get any song you want on your device, and if you choose the alarm to wake you up with music, get the song you want by clicking below that and choosing 'internal storage'. Select Micro-macro: youtube and choose your favorite song. You can wake up to any song ever, and it's FREE! every morning I wake up to the ending theme song for my favorite Anime, Hetalia: Axis Powers, sang by my self-proclaimed husband Germany! (If you didn't get that last statement, sorry, it's an Otaku thing.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|no,  its great.  I get bored very easily and with this many games in one app,  its impossible to be bore.  I enjoy the games more than the pop ups though.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played it on my phone and it's so much better on a tablet.Took a minute,but finally it's on the kindle fire.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What not to like, the romance, violence, heroes...I was not planning to read this book until my colleague lent the first book of the trilogy to me.  At first, I thought it was just a typical young adult book.  By the 2nd book, Catching Fire, I started to understand the message behind the story.  There were so many people sacrificed their lives in this book.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I cried because Katniss' loss of her sister whom was the one that she promised would protect forever.<br /><br />The author wrote this for young adults whom, I think, our future and pillars of this country and the world.  Doesn't it the whole setup of the government, Capitol, like our government right now?  Eliminating the part using the children to play in the Hunger Games, our government put us into such a big debt which is no more different from taking the future from our children in the book.<br /><br />My only son is only 3 years old.  It will be a long time before I can read it to him and make him understand.  But I sure hope that any parents and teachers will bring the good messages out of this book and enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so glad this game finally came out for the kindle. I was mad that apple users were the only ones who could play it.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|always have loved megadeth but this album was a little bit different it didnt exactly sound like megadeth at first but as i listen to it more it was great but overall is a awesome cd and great buy trust me
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like many other readers, I was a bit skeptical about purchasing at first because I've read quite a few self-published works that weren't well-edited. This is not one of those cases. The books are well written and have obviously seen some editing prior to being released. Another good addition to my collection of dystopian fiction and as good as any of the mainstream published works of its type I own. I applaud the author and look forward to buying more of his work.
B007KQXB2G|4.0|Who doesn't love Don Draper? This show is awesomen but this was seasoin was just good, not great. Regardless, I would still recommend it.
B0086700CM|1.0|it was acting all weared so I deleted it and try to get It again so It would refresh but it did not let me download
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WoW! This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down! I can not wait to learn more about Christian's past! He is such an interesting character! I can't wait to devour the last two books even though a part of me wants to drag it out for as long as I can! I know that Ana and Christian's story will be one I will come back to many times!<br /><br />Laters baby!
B0086700CM|5.0|I had this game before it was on the kindle fire app store and I had woo much fun playing it but it would close a lot but then I downloaded this and it never closes YAY
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really fun to play... they are starting to get better games in now! plz just add sims 3 and the other fun games!
B008510WAE|1.0|I'm tired of waiting for a  fix.  I reported the issue to MumboJumbo  LLC with no response.  A bit ago, I e-mailed Amazon Support requesting a refund.  I don't understand how this app received approval from Amazon to be listed, since it's obviously not functioning properly.  I'm fed up with eating up the costs of crappy and poorly developed apps!!!  :-/
B005CKPQHA|5.0|The idea of this show is simply brilliant and it's executed even better. You can't go wrong with any season, in my opinion.
B003Y5H51K|4.0|The movie scenario itself is rather dumb, stupid and ... whatever! But you must admit, that the scenery, filming and ambience are stunning and breathtaking! How much of a sense do you expect from watching Transformers, Avatar and many, many other flicks, c'mon you guys! It's all for the SHOW! Spectacular, what can I say?!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great ending to an amazing story! My only complaint is that it's over! I love Ana and Christian's story and it's been wonderful to see Christian become the person he was always meant to be. He's of course still his moody self but he finally understands that people DO love him and that he deserves it. E.L. James ended this series on a wonderful note. Everyone should give this series a chance. You won't be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|my boyfriend lives this game so when he saw it in the app store for my kindle he made me get it. and its good that he did Bc now were both addicted to it!!!!:)
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game for children and adults.It is very addicting and will keep you busy for HOURS! I've heard it was coming out FINALLY!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Makes you want to play all night, level after level! I really love this game! You will too!  The special effects are Awesome!
B000NQRE1E|3.0|Obviously a superb and classic movie, but it wasn't quite as good as I expected in Blu Ray. I would say it didn't really add all that much.
0719524520|5.0|Sarah's Key is a beautifully written, highly emotional story.  It reads quickly; and it is a real page turner.  The characters are well drawn and the story is one we should never forget.
B0086700CM|4.0|If you already downloaded Temple Run from the Download Everything app, don't waste your time on this one.<br /><br />This version is a bit laggy at times and the only minor plus is that you can buy coins....but who buys coins?<br /><br />Nonetheless, still a good game
0670022950|5.0|Whether you agree or not with Pinker's conclusions the tale he weaves to reach them is well worth the trip.  As with his previous books, he illustrates his points with humorous and interesting anecdotes that make this book highly enjoyable.  It's clear from other's readers comments that he's stepped on a lot of toes with this one, but don't let that put you off:  read, enjoy and come to your own conclusions.[[ASIN:0670022950 The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined]]
B007SSEU9O|3.0|I thought the movie maker spent too much time on her later years in life, not the actual good she did for the country.
0060775858|5.0|I loved this book as a small child, I have no idea whats with the negative reviews.  1 year old infants are fickle and have short attention spans.  If your child doesn't like it, they don't like it.  But should we really judge a book off of the taste of child who cannot yet speak?
B0086700CM|5.0|finally!! I really wanted temple run for my kindle fire.I was disappointed that I couldn't get,now I can.Once I got it I couldn't put my kindle down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid reader and like to read what is currently on the Best Seller list. I especially love trilogies like The Dragon Tattoo Series and The Hunger Games. I am in a book club where we read well written novels, historical fiction and non-fiction if it is worthy of a good discussion. Sometimes it is nice to read a book that is an easy read to escape. I thought that is what Fifty Shades of Grey was and I was SO WRONG. My reasons why:<br /><br />1.  This book could have been written by a 10 year old and I am not kidding. The prose is juvenile and repetitive. Some examples are the use of Jeez, Crap, and Holy Crap over and over.<br /><br />2.  The characters are completely unlikable. I did not bond with any of them nor did I care what happened to them.<br /><br />3.  The sex in this book was extremely boring. Her descriptions of her vagina as \\"down there\\" and my \\"sex\\" only made it awkward.<br /><br />4.  I have a 19 year old daughter and what bothered me the most was that the author chose the main character to be a 21 year old virgin who had never even been kissed. She has her meet a 26 year<br />  billionaire and has her first sexual experience and then proceeds to introduce her to getting pleasure from pain in various ways. She is often apprehensive and frightened of what is going to<br />  happen to her.<br /><br />5.  I am disgusted that a woman could write this book and that it has become so popular. I hope that my daughter never reads it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have been doing a lot of reading on Special operation forces, especially Navy Seals. While looking for such books i came across this book. My initial thought was oh yea this must be the story of a Navy seal serving for the country, but i was wrong. This is not about just a Navy Seal who got into Special ops and fought for the country, this story is not that simple, this about a person who over came all obstacles to reach his goal. Don't get me wrong for saying just a Navy Seal, no disrespect at all to all the Navy Seals who are serving this country. This story is unique.<br /><br />This guy just never gave up. He got addiction problem, he fought and won, he lost his eye, still he fought and won, he messed up his fingers, again didn't give up, fought again and won.. what else can go wrong in a person's life...he never gave up..on the family side, such a loving husband and father...when i was reading his letter to his kids, it brought me tears..<br /><br />such an amazing person..such an inspiring story....because of great people like him,we are enjoying the kind of freedom we have right now...<br /><br />i'm not a citizen of United States, but after knowing about people like Adam Brown and his Navy Seal brothers, i feel its my privilege to be in this great country..<br /><br />Thank you Adam for everything you have done...you and your family will always be in my thoughts and prayers..Thank you...
B005HFUQAM|5.0|This is such a beautiful collection of songs. There is a triumphant sadness that ebbs and flows throughout the songs thanks to the excellent use of brass. Makes me want to sit on the beach with a picnic for one. Or two, but at least one.

B00634GHJA|5.0|I've only used this app one time and it was flawless.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that cannot transfer photos with a flash drive or other devices.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Purchase immediately. You will not regret it. I haven't slept since starting this.  Do not delay. An instant classic. Buy it
0345803485|1.0|Let me start by saying I am an avid reader and I'm usually somewhat pleased with all books BUT...this book made me want to scream. This book was everywhere and everyone was commenting on how how amazing it is. So I bought the book and less than half way I was furious. I questioned myself...was I reading the right book? Unfortunately I was. I am really disappointed. First, the writing was poor. I felt like a teenager wrote it. Second, a 26 year old man taking advantage of an unexperienced college student...a man who uses women as sex slaves?! Not only does the writer portray the acceptance of using women, she is also indicating women enjoy this type of abuse. The girl in the book, a virgin at first, is taken over by a man with no respect for women. I am bothered by so many aspects. The guy is famously rich, perfect looks, and a few other perfect \\"parts \\",  but incapable of love. He meets a young girl and wants nothing more but sex. The story is pointless and a little over the top. I was amazed at the emotions this girl felt...being used by this \\"perfect \\" stranger? I couldn't believe it, the girl had met a sex God with jealousy issues, doesn't like to touched, and enjoys inflicting pain to get himself off. She enjoyed this man so much, she spent most of her time crying...wow, where do I find me a Mr. Grey?! I could go on further, but I would prefer to stop at that. I have not recommended this book to anyone. Because I read a lot, people usually come to me and ask for my thoughts before purchasing books. Every person who has asked me, I tell them flat out, \\"do not waste your time or money \\"! Good luck to anyone out there who feels they still want read this book.
1582406723|5.0|I had not read comic books for quite awhile, but became hooked on the television show.  So I thought that I would try picking up some of the books.  I am reading them after the seasons are over and need to get to the second book in awhile.<br /><br />But the first book did not disappoint.  It is different to some degree from the television show, but there are things in common.  Once again you are drawn into a world gone awry where people are trying to survive and try to hang onto their humanity.<br /><br />The comics, like the series, are really more about people rather than zombies, and it works well in being a well-thought out and well paced story.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|Not as slim and stylish as my Otterbox Commuter, but the extra thickness provides cushioning against accidental drops, whereas the Otterbox protects only against scratches. Also provides a good grip, to prevent those accidental drops in the first place.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|this game is good because it teaches me how to play the piano and it shows which keys to press to play the song.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|this game takes sudoku to the next level. a cross between logic problem puzzles and cross-stiching. i love playing it!
B0086700CM|5.0|all of my friends had this game on their I pods and I didn't have it on my kindle. I just got it today........... AWSOME!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this is a really fun game but I have reinstalled it three times on my kindle fire. one day I try and open it and it wont do anything.  reinstall it and it works fine. doesn't make any sense to me
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is a great hidden object/adventure game. Hints are free but sometimes take awhile to recharge, and some of the challenges are skippable, although I didn't skip many. It's not too short nor too hard. I'm currently downloading the second game of the series, and I can't wait to play it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You will read this book in a few days because you will not be able to put it down.  Don't think this is a book for kids.  I usually don't re-read books, but this one I probably will.
B007SGM084|1.0|I just can't understand who would actually get into reading these books...  the story is so far from believable that it's insulting.  I'm so sure a billionaire, gorgeous, accomplished CEO (who happens to only be 27) is going to be insanely in love with a mousy 22 year old who doesn't have any real world experience and the emotional maturity of a teenager.  It's like it's a desperate fantasy book for all those mediocre people living mediocre lives and fantasize that even though they are plain and boring, they too could have the most eligible bachelor on the planet be obsessively in love with them and devote all his waking thoughts and emotions to every little expression they make.  This could have been an interesting concept if the people were more realistic.  Instead it was just irritatingly unrealistic.  You people can keep fantasizing though, I prefer something at least semi-feasible.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like it.I've made it woo far.soo if you like ice age you will love this. soo just get it.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Does a good job of identifying what song you are listening to and also has a few extra features, for example finding the lyrics or even watching the YouTube video of the song.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love this game but it needs to update much faster.Other than that its pretty fun (and kind of addictive).
B006OCM0G0|2.0|it may be free but you have to buy stuff with real money. once you expand once you have to buy with money.
0553386794|2.0|I can't see why everyone likes this so much.  The prose is plodding, the characters unlikeable and the prose tedious.  A tenth grader could write better prose than Martin.  I want the prose to sing and the story to engage, not bore me.  I tried slogging through the next three too see if it would get better and maybe it did, but not much.<br /><br />Even Terry Goodkind is better than this Martin guy.  If you want to read something good, try the \\"Way of Kings\\" by Brandon Sanderson.  He is young still getting better, not over the hill and losing it.
1582701709|1.0|I have seen this video. Basically it leads you to believe that there is a mysterious 'secret' to achieve all you want. According to the author, if you'd like a Ferrari, just sit on your sofa, close your eyes and vividly imagine and feel that you are driving one, then the Universe will conspire to get you one. This is ridicolous. I am not arguing against POSITIVE thinking, and I agree that negative thinking will likely get one into more of what 'he doesn't want', but the author makes you believe that all you need to do is being grateful and sit on your sofa going 'VRRROOOOMMM'.....<br />Ridicolous. There's far better material than this, I recommend the ultimate goal program by Brian Tracy. He will encourage positive thinking backed up by ACTION.<br />Also, 'The Secret' is even potentially dangerous. I have heard that some people had some bad disease which got worse because they were following the great advice of this DVD and were 'thinking' themselves into health instead of going to a doctor. Read the article on Wikipedia before buying this DVD. Rhonda Byrne has made millions by selling this trash. Grow up.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was own the app store today looking at the free app of the day when I saw something in the top free apps that looked like temple run
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This is a live double CD with one CD consisting of seven songs totaling sixty-three-minutes and twenty-five-seconds... and the second CD has four songs totaling forty-three-minutes and one-second... which provides the listener with over ONE-HUNDRED-SIX-MINUTES of live bliss. (Why Amazon doesn't make it a standard practice to include such important statistics for every CD is beyond me.) The Tedeschi Trucks Band attacks music from many directions on this CD and almost all of it is highly successful. Their performance of the title track *EVERYBODY'S TALKIN* is performed with such a gusto it's like the original was given a blood transfusion. As they perform it... it truly comes across as one of those songs that you not only find yourself tapping your feet uncontrollably to... but you start bobbing your head like a happy bird in springtime attacking a worm or seed on the ground. On subsequent songs the unit combines Tedeschi's voice that \\"growls\\" with the soul of Janis Joplin... with tremendous guitar licks and horn backup. There are some great and beautiful solo's... but truth be told the guitar solos are much more natural and enjoyable than some of the horn interludes.<br /><br />The biggest positive surprise for me on the two CD set (in addition to the exuberant fresh take on *EVERYBODY'S TALKIN') ... was song one on disc two *THAT DID IT*. Being that my greatest love is *TRUE-ELECTRIC-BLUES*... the group's total team performance on this cut results in an absolutely... perfect... everything... electric-blues song!... voice... backup ... and truly legendary guitar solos. And at eight-minutes-twenty-one-seconds long... it is the perfect length for wailing and string bending to perfection. From an electric-blues-perspective this is without a doubt my favorite song on this double CD.<br /><br />My one minor disappointment was part of the performance of Stevie Wonder's *UPTIGHT*. Since this was one of my favorite songs as a kid... and Amazon has no samples on its site... I couldn't wait to hear the group's take on it. When I opened the package when I got it and saw that *UPTIGHT* was sixteen-minutes-eight-seconds long... I really got excited anticipating what they would be able to do with long solos based on Stevie's instrumentation. Well... I almost never say a great song is too long... but to  give a little hint  of  my disappointment is my belief that long drummer solos went out back in the seventies... and even then you had to be there... and be a little drunk to get excited about it. Well, I always pride myself on honesty in my reviews so there you have it. But despite that one small discomfort... I still give it a 5-star rating... and to only pay $10.88 for this much music is another plus.couldn't wait to hear the group's take on it.

1439130833|1.0|It's hard to believe that someone comes up with such ridiculous ideas and make millions. The thing is....these 'authors' are very smart. They put together some trash that they have never been able to prove with facts to anyone, make a very professional looking movie out of it, call up some 'famous guests' so that they will all be able to make more millions and share them.<br /><br />And who's left to struggle with their little lives and money problems? People like you who are unable to think logically and unable to ask themselves 'if this was really true, why isn't everybody doing it? Why don't we see it on school's desks? Why the authors give no real roof that their stupid make-me-feek-good theories work?'<br /><br />People like Byrne have been around forever...from the charlatans in the Middle Ages, to the Bronnikov brothers, to Sylvia Browne, to Jose Silva, to the tarot reader... etc etc etc.....the list goes on.<br /><br />I wonder why there are so many systems to 'get' always the same things, i.e. money, hapiness etc.<br /><br />Seriously, I am all for fun, but if you waste your money and time on products like these,  you need to grow up and get a reality check.<br /><br />PS. watch some interesting documentaries, such as Derren Brown Investigates, instead of wasting your time with this silly trash
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game. can earn invest and energy and game money without having to buy.  however can be confusing to find stuff and not a lot of help.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard alot about the book.  I thought it was very interesting.  I do not think it should be called Mommy Porn!  I am sure there are a lot more books out there alot worse than this one. It kept my interest and I am on Book 3.  One tells you the bases. Book 2 is better and so far 3 is even better.  I wished there was a 4th Book.

B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I watched Moneyball as a Liverpool FC follower. Having been over-run, sorry, taken over by the owners of the Boston Red Sox I could see far more clearly the mindset being introduced into UK soccer. Is the current Swansea manager Brad Pitt or is it the current Wigan manager? The Brad Pitt character stays with his small team.<br /><br />I could also get a better sense of why Kenny Dalglish was sacked. The storyline about cutting players from the team could have been part of the Dalglish demise. Early on in the film player marketability is shown to be foolish. Facets of baseball playing technique or even his looks were overriding the key element of scoring more points than the other team. In some soccer conversations the way a team plays is more important than winning. Strange.<br /><br />Okay I struggled with the implications behind playing on first base. I could only recall Abbott and Costello's brilliant `Who's on first base' routine. And it was only during the end of the credits that I realised the players names are real players. But the fundamental alteration in mindset in the dressing room and with the coaching staff was easy to follow. And after Man City's dramatic last minute capture of the Premiership, the Oakland Athletic rise and then nearly fall on the last hit of the bat thing was eerily pertinent.<br /><br />I would also say that after seeing this film there is no chance of a new Anfield stadium being built. My preference, and I know this is controversial, would be for a ground share with Everton. It makes the most sense. It cuts out sentiment and romance. Funding much easier from Europe and UK government. It's daft having two passed their sell by date stadia so close together in the same city.<br /><br />I must make it clear that Moneyball centres on winning. Million dollar baseball players who are unperturbed by losing a game were `traded' or let go. This I do like. Money and sport have always had a shy relationship. Unless you are a winner.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Worst movie ever.... I wouldn't even give it a star if Amazon didn't make me- Terrible ending, the movie isn't even realistic... no hypothermia after falling in the river?  no hydration other than alcohol?  not to mention the wolves eyes looked like LED flash lights.

031618201X|4.0|Being a huge fan of the steampunk paranormal Parasol Protectorate series I was eager to see what this was like. Naively, I expected the pictures to be in color (I've since learned manga isn't usually), and I was hoping to see Ivy's hats and Lord Akeldama's tastefully flamboyant wardrobe in their full multi-hued glory, so I was disappointed to discover that all but the first few pages are in black and white. Still, I enjoyed the book's adaptation of the story enough to read it straight through, but it necessarily rushes along at a brisk pace. Readers who haven't read the original books may have a hard time following the action and will certainly be missing a lot of the fun detail. Peripheral but important characters like Ivy, Biffy, Floote, and Alexia's family only make brief appearances, so it's sort of like seeing a movie condensation of a loved book. Good for what it is, but no replacement for the real thing.
1402786360|5.0|I was so excited when I received this book in the mail.  I had pre-ordered it, and didn't realize it had shipped so it was like Christmas morning when I realized what it was!  I couldn't wait to get a chance to pour over every page.  Heather is truly an artist and it shows in her ability to create such wonderful desserts.  I'm not very artistic, but with her simple step by step instructions I believe I can make some beautiful (not to mention delicious) desserts too.  A must have book!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|In my opinion, this book is a perfectly written masterpiece. Every single detail has a reason and it is just predictable enough to get the adrenaline rushing. The surprises in this book are pretty major and it has one of the best climaxes I have ever experienced. If you are going to buy this and have enough money, buy the whole series. You will not regret it.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this game on my HTC Rezound and I was really excited to see this was available on the Kindle Fire. but it lags too much so I hope they update and fix this soon.
B00722Y1EK|5.0|Found this by accident and love it. Lots of bells and whisles! Nice HUD. Well worth 2 bucks. Thanks to Dev. :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Sooooo fun! 2 thumbs up! :)<br />I recommend this game to any one of any age. I'm 10 and this game seems 8-20 to me
B0063GORYU|2.0|This is an excellent solitaire app in terms of graphics.  It's a pity that this is a just a \\"cover\\" for a extremely obtrusive full-screen, with-noise-and-video, barrage of ads.  Worse yet, this app advertises an \\"upgrade\\" (for which many reviewers have posted warnings) that gets you many solitaire games--and ads that take over your screen even when the app is theoretically not running.<br /><br />Ads are, of course, the price one pays for \\"free.\\"  But this is unacceptably excessive.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|I have been a loyal fan of this show ever since it started. I even got the first four seasons on dvd and re-watched them- they are even better the second time around. So like all other fans of the show I waited patiently for over a year for season five to come out. All I can say is: WHAT HAPPENED?! The show is absurd as well as deeply frustrating in that every time some juicy idea is mentioned we think this is going to be cool but then it is promptly dropped and we are left wondering, again, WHAT HAPPENED?! Sadly, all good things must come to an end and I believe that is true for Mad Men. I have been a fan of other shows such as Breaking Bad, Damages, Hell On Wheels, The Walking Dead and Sons Of Anarchy but not a fan of shows like The Sopranos, The Killing or The Wire. Hopefully that will give others an idea of what I like and dislike so they will have something to which to compare my review.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I keep trying to visit other villages and the game tells me either I am not online or to update. I am online and when I do the yes to the update it doesn't work. and there is one challenge that almost requires you spend real money if you want to advance. I also lost over 150000 coins in an instant and still have no idea how. if this gets fixed I might change my rating.
B0086700CM|4.0|I can not download it on my kindle fire a kindle fire sucks I cant download temple run it ducks
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|this app sucks really bad because you can only play one game or you can waste 15$ on this piece of crap
B0012Q732O|1.0|Wow, so bad, such a waste of time, you'd have to see it to believe it. This movie doesn't work, on any level. Badly written, badly cast, highly derivative and boringly predictable, its pace plods and action / CGI fails to impress. The sabretooth tiger is only in 2 short scenes, btw, and what appears to be an \\"epic\\" movie (even if only for special effects) is in fact like a poor man's Conan. The lead actor/actress are both laughably bad... Blue-eyed teenybopper beauty with makeup and (lol) model skinny-flabby arms who's supposed to be part of a hardscrabble Himalayan-mountain-type tribe? Just one example of the silliness you won't be able to suspend your disbelief over. I won't even start on the historical / geographical nonsense. Did i mention it was boring? Took me 3 separate sessions to finally watch all the way through to the end. I paid $2.50 for the DVD and feel like it was money badly spent.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Love it, cannot wait for more. I have played some of the other games, I just want more more. Updates are could come quicker, but I am patient.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|make sure you have plenty of time because you'll find yourself playing every spare moment. lots of fun good for all ages
B0086700CM|5.0|When I got this app I thought it was going to be boring but I tried it and I loved it. It is so challenging.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app like totally I just down loaded it on my kindle fire!!!!!! so very cool never dought it!
B0086700CM|5.0|my brother has this on his I pod and I played it all the time and finally I can play it on my kindle . THANK GOD
B0086700CM|5.0|I have tried other running games before and this one has the best graphics, controls and just overall gameplay. if i didn't happen to get this for free this morning I would definitely had paid for it.
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's book is one of the very best books I have read on NDE's. It is so well written and her descriptions are some of the best I have seen. This book will be saved in my permanent collection. Everyone should be able to read it. You will never be sorry and I don't think people will have so much fear of death after reading it. A very fine book indeed! A rare insight into what life is really, truly about! Thank you, Anita!
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome it is finally released to the kindle fire!!!!this is an awesome game I recommend this game to you if you have never played it before!!!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|lots of fun. wish I could zoom playing on kindle. turn of standby when downloading and it will download with no problem.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game but some of the controls are hard to work and a few were confusing :D I will definitely keep playing though.
0525478817|5.0|So, I've read nearly every book by John Green. He's easily my favorite author so of course walking into this I highly suspected I would not be disappointed, but I did not expect it to be this wonderful either. His books generally help people relate or feel like someone understands them, but this book was making you fall in love with these people, then wrench them away. It makes you love them, laugh with them, and cry when things take turns you never expected. It is easily one of the best purchases I've ever made. I read it within 24 hours, but it's two weeks later and I'm still carrying it around with me. Thank you for writing such beauty, and thank you for understanding us. <3 nerdfighters.
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOO GREAT I PLAYED IT ON MY BROTHERS I PAD THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!  YAY YAY YAYAal
B008133DO8|4.0|I enjoy Sherlock Holmes in any period of time and this one in the 21st century doesn't fail to entertain. This episode was VERY different and makes Sherlock seem vulnerable to the dominatrix, Irene Adler. I was worried about him for a bit, but of course Sherlock comes out on top! I would recommend this one for sure.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game has quickly become my newest obsession!! :) Performs perfectly on my Samsung Infuse with no problems at all.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great book. I felt as if it were written specifically for me. Ive made all the mistakes listed and have never made it to where I wanted to be. I'm starting this routine and will let u know how it goes. Buy the book it is definatley worth it
1400052181|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had heard of it, but really didn't know anything about it - I didn't even know if it was fiction or nonfiction. So, when I finally got a chance to read it, I was a little surprised when I realized what it was about.<br /><br />I found the book to be very well researched and well written. It is fascinating to think about how cell research happens, and to think about the real people whose cells are being used. Although it isn't the main focus of the book, I also found the discussion of current laws about what healthcare providers can and cannot do regarding collection of 'materials' to be interesting.<br /><br />The Lacks family is portrayed in all their flawed humanity. At once proud of their heritage and angry because they feel that they have been cheated (on both an emotional and a financial level), the children and family of Henrietta Lacks are portrayed as the complex people they are.<br /><br />On a very deep level, this is a story about human rights.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a super fun time waster. scrats game totally rocks my world.  just glad they can bring some top notch free games to the app world! way to go guys ant thanks
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run has always been a good game and my firends all had it on there ipod touch and I could not get it. now it is here and it is for free and I have a way bigger screen.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Mystery on top of mystery!  It's a shame the author passed away before continuing the series; I was craving more.  Impossible to put down.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|This was a birthday gift for our now 2 year old daughter.  It's a beautiful Memorial Day weekend and we finally were going to use this for the first time, but there's a hole in it :(  I'd ordered this on behalf of my mother in law for my daughters may 13th birthday, and now the return date has expired.  I'm emailing amazon to see what they can do, as the return window expired yesterday.  I'm hopefull for a good outcome, but beware of the blow up blues.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is loads of fun great fr all ages and easy to play hours of fun and entertainment download and enjoy
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer's fifth studio album, &#34;Born and Raised&#34;, is receiving a lot of attention for &#34;going country&#34;. Having heard it a few times, though, I can honestly say it wasn't as &#34;country&#34; as I thought it would be. It's almost more folk, or bluesy, or at the end of the day just good music.  &#34;Queen of California&#34;, the leadoff track, is one of the album's true highlights. Later, &#34;If I Ever Get Around to Living&#34; kicks in, a great jam that feels a little bit like Pink Floyd. &#34;Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967&#34; is also way better than it sounds like it would be, an odd but strangely motivating piece unlike anything Mayer has done before.  And all the way through, Born and Raised is just a really strong record. I'm not a huge fan of any of the genres Mayer usually does, but for whatever reason I've got all five of his albums, and I like each one (even though I'm especially partial to Heavier Things). Born and Raised fits in nicely with his best work.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is just amazing!!  and its so addicting!! my highscore right now is 100000000!its soooooooooo much fun!!!! ill reccomend it to anyone!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Kept me up reading in the wee hours regardless of the impending doom of the alarm clock. If you like a nicely set up world that slowly reveals itself to you via the thoughts and actions of the characters, I suggest you give this one a try. It's cheap even, too cheap.
0425241505|4.0|The synopsis sums up the bones of the book quite well, the information that isn't noted is how entertaining the Elder Races are in this introductory novel.<br /><br />The characters were personable and vividly drawn so I did not have a problem picturing them in my mind. I especially enjoyed the interaction between Pia & Dragos on the bumpy travels through love-land.  Pia's inner voice was loud and deserved her own name as she definitely had her own opinions.  She was very much a part of the story and went a long way in expressing humanity and human emotion in a foreign environment.  At the same time it was difficult to understand why she would have such a hard time when she'd known that she is half-Wyr and interfaced with that world on a daily basis.  Dragos on the other hand wore the actions of the traditional protective & befuddled paranormal alpha male extremely well.  Together they added substance to the cookie-cutter roles.  I would have liked the villain to be more diabolical but he was sufficient and ably held the title.  The secondary and tertiary characters were personable enough to deserve more ink later down the road.  The plot itself was layered enough so that the book didn't feel overwritten or full of unnecessary information.  Also, the action and romance were given equal weight creating a very nice balance and the reading time flew by.<br /><br />What didn't work for me is minor in the scheme of things . It was Pia, as delightful as she was - she was also annoying and seemed out of character.<br /><br />Overall  I ended up liking this visit enough to go forward with the series.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This movie is excellent. A lot of ppl do not understand the meaning of the movie. They are watching it for entertainment value only. This movie needs to be applied to everyday life. If you watch the news, you need to see this. If you feel like something is wrong with the world, you need to watch this. Please watch it with a open mind, so you'll be a part of the solution, instead of being a part of the brain washed masses of people, who has no clue of whats going on in their faces. Even Hollywood is trying to tell you. They laugh as they show the truth in your face.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome.I love it is so addicting.finally it came to the kindle fire.I can play this app for more than one whole day
0618871713|5.0|Pure joy, even in sorrow and loss. Perfection on so many levels. Bravisima. Like Maus, Fun Home is a must-read. Breath-takingly well-executed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have had no problem with this app. This KF on occasion,  but not this version of accuweather, I also have a back up to any weather app. MY BONES ACHE JUST B4 IT RAINS.  Other than that,  this app works wonders for any other weather info!!!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I know a lot of buyers complained about music change, but I was so happy to just watch the episodes, it didn't bother me. There were some moments where you felt it was really obvious, but not enough to NOT buy the series. I got sick of trying the catch the episodes on LOGO. I feel so happy to have this collection, I watch it over and over again! I wish this show as still on!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is in my opinion very cool! I love it&hellip; it never gets old thanks for this amazing game. Imangi Studios!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazon suggested Wool to me when it first came out and I thought, for .99 how could you go wrong?  I absolutely loved the first one and bought the next 5 installments.  The only thing that's disappointing is that there aren't any more out yet!  This is a unique sci-fi story that will keep you hanging on every word; I haven't been this addicted to a story in a very long time. When I was reading it I stayed up many a night, much later than I should have, just to see what happened next.  If you love the possibilities of what happens when the world ends, then you'll love this story.<br /><br />It's a must read and the reigning champion of favorite books right now.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this I have been waiting to get it my friend always was asking how come I did not have it but I love it

B00000JQ0E|5.0|I'm really happy about this product. It is everything that I had expected - of course -  and I couldn't<br />say I'm disappointed about anything. Why would I be? It's a great album!
159514188X|5.0|OMG- this was an amazing book- read it in one day. I think that teens should read it to realize every thought & every action impacts someone else! If you are a teacher or parent of a teen, I highly recommend reading it! I don't remember word for word... but one of the best parts of the book: When you affect part of someone's life (like picking on them at school)- it may only impact you at school, but for the person being affected- it impacts EVERY PART of their life, they can't just shut it off once they get home...
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love this CD.  Everyone should buy it. You won't be disappointed. Adam put his heart and soul into this CD and it shows. My favorites are ALL OF THEM.  I saw him perform some of these songs in Wilkes Barre on Friday. Adam Lambert is the total package.
0307477479|1.0|Hands down one of the worst books I have suffered through in a very long time.  I see no point to this book, story or characters.  On what basis it won a Pultizer is a complete mystery to me.  Do yourself a huge favor and don't waste your time.
0143119680|1.0|This novelist had a bit of a good idea, with her young researcher at Oxford who is trying to ignore the fact that she is a witch.  But the book soon descends into a rip-off of Twilight:  the hero is handsome and will do anything for the heroine, he swaddles her in the lap of luxury, they don't have sex, she's under threat, etc.  Most of it is simply dull.
B0086700CM|1.0|I LOVE temple run...I have it on mu phone and it is sooooo  addicting, but when I tried getting it, it didn't work! I have been waiting for a very long rime to get temple run on my kindle and now it wont work...other games don't work either and rout now I want like 20 but cant get them. any ideas??????
B007ZMD14I|5.0|As I played this the first time, I was thrilled to find that each cut was as good or better than the one before. Besides the title cut & the single, \\"You're A Lie,\\" I esp. liked \\"No More Heroes,\\" & \\"Anastasia.\\" Slash sounds better than ever, and technically he's raised the bar for his fellow Rock Gods, by laying down everything from flamenco to metal. It's no wonder that throughout his career, everyone from Iggy Pop and Micheal Jackson, to Alice Cooper and more recently, Rihanna, have asked him to play on their records.<br /><br />Myles Kennedy is the perfect lyrical muse/lead vocalist for Slash and his unbelievably well-honed chops. He proved himself worthy by being the only artist to sing on two tracks on Slash's debut solo album, (\\"Starlignt,\\" and \\"Back From Cali,\\") and then touring with Slash for that album and not only nailing songs from it by Ian Astbury, Chris Cornell, and Andrew Stockdale, (no small feat,) but also material from Velvet Revolver, Slash's Snakepit, and of course, some of Guns N' Roses's greatest hits. Check out the double live disc, [[ASIN:B0062A5RUA Featuring Myles Kennedy Live (Made In Stoke 24/7/11)]] if you missed the tour.<br /><br />Finally, after twenty-five-plus years, a handful of bands/projects, a serious health scare, (2001 heart failure,) a couple of wives, and kids, epic drug addiction, and 6 years of sobriety, Slash finally has the Kick You in the Face rock band he deserves! Seriously, in my opinion, Slash and his wicked guitars, plus Myles Kennedy on vocals, Todd Kerns on bass, and Brent Fitz on drums, (otherwise known as \\"Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators,\\") equal one helluva great rock and roll band.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"that other\\" band, (and back from when they were playing the bars on Sunset Blvd mind you,) but once the venues, (and some of the band's egos,) got too big, the dynamics changed and they were never the same. Hopefully people will not feel the need to mention He Who Shall Not Be Named in every review of this record, cause make no mistake, this is a solid rock record, from a solid rock band.<br /><br />Thankfully, Slash has continued to grow musically, and his big, fat, swirling guitar riffs have never sounded better. Hey, even if his head swells a little, no worries, cause there's gotta be plenty of room left inside that big old hat.y review of this record, cause make no mistake, this is a solid rock record, from a solid rock band.<br /><br />Thankfully, Slash has continued to grow musically, and his big, fat, swirling guitar riffs have never sounded better.

B005804NCI|5.0|This is a review of the multi-channel sound mix of the classic album from Fleetwood Mac (mostly).<br /><br />Rumors is not my favorite album by FM, the previous Album is, but oh well.  This one is good enough, you know?  Kidding, both are true classics, and I can never get enough of Christine Perfect/McVie's voice.  The rhythm section, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, are sooo underrated, too.  Listen to the songs leading up to 'Werewolves of London' on Warren Zevon's classic 'Excitable Boy'.  Not bad, I must say.  But when Werewolves cranks up, it is Fleetwood on drums and McVie on bass, and the change in rhythm section is, to me, almost astonishing.  Not really flashy, just so much more solid, so many more phrases where you say 'hot dang that's good.'  I dunno, maybe its just me, but I think the sum exceeds the parts where those two are concerned. Buckingham is an OK guitarist and good vocalist, and Nicks is loved by a lot of people.  The songwriting is frigging outstanding, of course, with offerings from Buckingham, Nicks and Christine McVie.<br /><br />This album has been available for a while in multi-channel format, specifically the DVD-A offering.  Unfortunately, by the time I got into multi-channel playback (not counting the quadrophonic experiment from the 70's) the DVD-A was just prohibitively expensive.  Looking at the prices of some of the SACDs and DVD-A offerings I bought just a few years ago, all I can say is thank goodness I bought them then, and am not trying to get into things now.  Some of the albums I bought for 17 dollars or so are now well over 100. 'Rumors' had always been too expensive, along with 'The Captain and Me' and 'Hotel California'.<br /><br />Rumors and Hotel California are now available in the SACD format, and at a price I can just afford.  Well, so is The Captain and Me, but the SACD is stereo only.<br /><br />The channel separation is just great, if you were wondering.  Voices from the center channel, the bass is mixed just a tad low, but we can adjust that with our multi-channel systems, no?  A couple of notches is all you need to bring out John's VERY tasty playing from that sub woofer you paid so much for.<br /><br />The surround (rear) speakers are a total part of the mix, not there for ambience like some.  All in all, a superb mix, and clear as a bell, and you WILL hear things you never have before, regardless of the fidelity of your old stereo system I'm sure you played this gem on.  You catch all the guitars, and there are more than I ever heard off of my vinyl copy.  A very enjoyable mix, and almost worth the 40 dollars I paid for it.  If you have a multi-channel set up, fork it over and grab this, it is why we do the surround thing.ow, but we can adjust that with our multi-channel systems, no?

B000WGWQG8|5.0|What a wonderful story. The costumes were very approprate and the acting was done very well and in character. I got the feeling like I was there watching the history unfold before my eyes. Thank you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books and couldn't get enough.  I got so wraped up in the story that I was sad when it ended.  It was a great love story.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Excellent read caught attention within few pages compelling reading and could not put book down, ordered next two books before I had finished first
B0052VI2V6|5.0|When vinyl was the only thing available I had this album.  I had a nice stereo, too, and took immaculate care of my records.  No dropping one on top of another, I lovingly placed records on the turntable, careful to keep the fingers off of the surface, only handling the edges, and GENTLY placed the needle into the grove.  I liked the Eagles, too, and liked this record, although it was kind of pedestrian for my tastes (not enough fast songs).<br /><br />When the SACD version came out, at a price that I could stand to pay, I went ahead and snapped it up.  It had been a goal for sometime to get a copy in the surround format, and now it is under 50 dollars, and I can lie to my wife and get away with how much it cost.<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, the intro to 'Hotel California' (the song) is a revelation, you have to hear it to understand what I mean.  It is NOTHING like the vinyl, there are guitars everywhere, doing harmony, with sound effects swirling across the sound stage....I heard very little of this off the record, just the two main guitars harmonizing.  It was truly one of those \\"a ha\\" moments we all hope for when playing the SACD for the first time.<br /><br />The rest of the album is as good, as clear, as separated as you could ever wish.  Take a deep breath and go ahead, click on 'add to my cart', and you will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|been waiting 4 ever for it come to the amazon market. now I have something to do 24/7 when I'm bored.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is such a great book! Well, the entire series is great! I haven't ever read books like this before, but I'm glad I did. I read all three books in two days! I just couldn't put them down.
0812416805|5.0|Liked this copy of the classic novel because it was hardback (which I prefer)<br />but it was used/cheap which I like better!<br /><br />The story is classic and I read it 50 yrs. ago when it first came out.<br />It's a great 'snapshot' of the south during the 30's and is<br />esp. unique because Dad was a single parent.  Would recommend it<br />to anyone over 12 if they really enjoy reading classic stories.<br /><br />Seller was excellent to deal with as well.

B007MU85D0|5.0|Really well-crafted melodic pop, sophisticated, folky, very Icelandic in the best sense of the word.  Great influences of Bjork and the Sugarcubes in their more melodic moments., yes, but also an ellectri \\"quiet is the new loud\\" and Peter, Bjorn, & John are here.  Great fun, heartfelt, and honest.  Well worth the price of admission.  One of 2012 best yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG I have been hearing about lots of people talking about how much fun temple run is on the ipad and ipod and so on. I played once and that was it. so I thought they might have ot for kindle fire and when they didn't I was like what the heck I mean come on. but finally here and I love it. I am so happy. yeah it has a few problems but I mean for it to come out for the kindle fire and all I think that it is pretty good quality for the kindle even though it has its tweeks. I love the game. I am not addicted to it but I do love it.

B0086700CM|5.0|finally we have it for kindle fire! i have been waiting along time so we could have temple run and i LOVE this game its so addicting!!!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|My sister recommended that I see this movie the next time it was shown on tv, but I decided to purchase the movie instead.  I was not disappointed.  I didn't know that much about autism, but in ads and write ups about autistic children, they didn't appear to be able to do very much, which led me to believe all autistic people were like that.  This woman is very different.  She is smart, educated, and isn't afraid to lay her condition out for everyone to see.  She has made such a difference in the way prey animals are treated and conveys a deep respect for them.  I have a completely different perception of an autistic individual now that I know more about her life.  I highly recommend this movie.  I also purchased her book, \\"Animals in Translation:....\\"  Claire Danes did an excellent job portraying Ms Grandin!
B000FC1JAI|5.0|I bought the print version, which was quite convenient to flip through, but I loved it so much I bought the Kindle version so that I could bookmark and share my highlights.<br /><br />Highly recommended. It's changed my way of thinking.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This would be fun except for freezing up all the time.  There needs to be an update to fix this problem!  I give it a 3star.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have a kindle fire I was trying my hardest to get Temple Run. Now I have it. Wooooohooooo<br />Man I love this game.<br />so excited
B0063IH60K|5.0|if I want to sit down and relax this is that game. you're able to play and change settings. its not frustrating.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run was amazing and its not a rip off. i loved it. it would more awesome if u could at other temples!!!!!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie delivers nothing in a grey jacket.  Even Liam can't carry this wandering, pointless script.  If only there were a way to go back in time and skip this.  I only hope that I can save others from this self indulgent, sophomoric lullaby masquerading as a movie.
0345803485|5.0|I'm halfway through this book and completely in love with it. I do not understand all the negative comments. Great literary writing? No it isn't but who said it had to be? This is a romance albeit a different sort of romance but a romance nonetheless and it will appeal on one level because of that. As for the kinky s&m scenes, to each his own. In my opinion whatever delivers pleasure as long as no laws are broken and no one is hurt is acceptable. I find Christian and Ana likeable, even loveable characters. As we read, we want to know about Christian's childhood. As for the comments about Ana's inner goddess, I find that her comments are not only ones that I can relate to but describing her conscience and subconscious as inner goddess is very clever.Also her comment about her subconscious sneering at her, making comments to her, calling her names, well I can relate to that and I know several others who can as well. Should she have said \\"my inner voice\\" oh please! Calling it her inner goddess is a wonderful way to refer to the fact that she is enjoying what is going on and referring to the other comments as her subconscious again should she say \\" my self doubts say\\" or \\" my brain says\\"? Seriously? I am also finding their emails witty and amusing as are the conversations they have in person.Ana challenges Christian as no woman he knows ever has and that is amazing in itself.  As I read, I am chuckling along with them. As for the sexual content, S&M is more prevalent than most realize and condemning it won't change that. If it's not your cup of tea, then read it and move on. THis is not only a romance, it is a young woman's sexual awakening and that is another reason this book appeals. The fact that I and a million others cannot wait to read what happens next and have all 3 books is a testament in itself to why this trilogy is so successful.[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
1594133379|5.0|I had first seen Dr. Bolte's talk on TED few years ago until I realize she, in fact, has written a book about her experience.<br />This book is very genuine and humbling.<br />I definitely enjoyed her detailed descriptions of how she felt during her stroke.<br />Also, her recovery journey is described in details.<br />Honestly, I think if anyone knows a persons/friend/family member suffering from brains stroke, this book is a must read.<br />Regardless of how improved our medical system is, she beautifulhly describes the problems on how the doctors/nurses are not paying attention while treating such patients.<br />The take home message was: those patients are fully aware of their surroundings. They just need time, patience and sincere and honest caring.<br />Finally, she talks about the importance of our right-brain and how it is ignored in our modern world/education. She provides some tips on how to empower the role of our right-brain (feelings in a world) in our lives.<br /><br />Enjoy reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|my friends were talking about this game and I got on my kindle and looked for it and it wasn't there and insted I downloaded temple seeker!! but I'm downloading it now

B0072KWPC2|4.0|It's been a very long wait for an mlps version of an album that brings back so many nice memories for me when I was a kid just getting into music which has become over the years an indispensible part of my life in various forms.  As far as smooth pop goes very few albums come close to this with every track being just an outstanding example of great songcrafting.  In retrospect, looking at the credits on this album I shouldn't be surprised when you see the Hall of Fame talent that was involved on the various tracks:<br /><br />1. Say You'll Be Mine: great way to start the album with Nicolette Larson on background vocals and the great Jay Graydon on solo guitar (Jay also plays a great solo on my favourite Steely Dan track, \\"Peg\\")<br />2. I Really Don't Know Anymore: another excellent track with Michael McDonald on background vocals and the brilliant Larry Carlton on solo guitar (Larry also plays excellent solos on my other favourite Steely Dan track, \\"Kid Charlemagne\\")<br />3. Spinning<br />4. Never Be the Same: fantastic solo by Jay Graydon again.<br />5. Poor Shirley<br />6. Ride Like the Wind: great way to start Side B of the album for those old enough like me to remember the good ole vinyl days when music sounded great before the gradual decline into cassette and cd and now the ultimate low of super-compressed MP3s; Michael McDonald again does a fabulous stint on background vocals.<br />7. The Light Is On: Larry Carlton on solo guitar with Eagles' alumn Don Henley and many Eagles' tracks co-writer J.D. Souther on background vocals!<br />8. Sailing: the magnum opus which still sends thrills up my spine all these years later<br />9. Minstrel Gigolo: for knowledgeable guitarists, Eric Johnson on solo guitar!<br />10. Mary Ann: the bonus track which is uninspiring filler and you can see why it was left off the original release in the first place but may interest diehard fans.<br /><br />There are few albums that stand the test of time as well as this one does for me and although this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version isn't the best designed and assembled that I've ever seen I have seen a lot worse and the inner sleeve though is very nicely done with a 12-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  The all important sound quality does not disappoint and is as good as one can expect from an SHM CD.  Thankfully I recall this album already sounding very good on the old cassette that I had when I first heard it standing as a testament to the great production job done by Michael Omartian in the first place.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of mellow pop of the highest quality!nd although this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version isn't the best designed and assembled that I've ever seen I have seen a lot worse and the inner sleeve though is very nicely done with a 12-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.

B0086700CM|5.0|OMG this is like the best game EVER!!!!!!!! Its sooooooooo much FUN. its kind of like Indiana Jones in a way but even better so if u like Indiana Jones this is the game FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love Temple Run!!!!!!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app works very good. I use it as my alarm clock to wake me every work day and it has not failed me. I put my on alarm sound on it because I like a loud alarm. Real simple to operate or set. Straight to the point. The programmer did a good job.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the booombbbb. I have it for my HTC and I play it 24/7. Ive been waiting 4ever for this game to come to the fire. So glad it is FINALLY HERE!!!!!!!!!

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Unbelievable, boring and on going to a point of self mutilation. This movie is about killer wolves that just love gnawing on human flesh. You will rip your eyes out at the stupidity of so-called experts.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|This headset is the first professional headset I bought. The sound quality is impressive to be sure, though to be honest I expected more. Also, 9 months from now the wires inside started to break. Right now for instance I'm talking to a friend online and the sound that's coming through is so faint it's barely but a whisper. If I play with the cord, I can get the full volume out of the headset, but then I have to hold as still as a statue otherwise it's another 5 minutes of fiddling with the damn thing to hear anything.<br /><br />I expect this from lower quality, cheap $10 headsets and earphones, but not this. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase something of quality.
B0086700CM|5.0|i waz soooo glad that temple run fanally came out on amazon i have this app on my moms iPAD and iPhone and its sooo addicting that i had to get it. i really recomend 4 u 2 get this!!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come out on the kindlefire market and now that it has it is as good as I expected
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and have used tot over a year on my iphone. the only drawback on using on my new. kindle fire is that I don't get the &quot; thought of the day&quot; and when I copy /paste cannot. truncate.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|This is, no doubt, a beautifully filmed movie with a couple of actors that carry their parts to the moon. Tilda Swinton has more than proved herself in other movies and moves herself up the ladder here. Ezra Miller, the young man who so menacingly plays the teenage son was brilliant. Undoubtedly, we will see much more of him.<br /><br />The back and forth in timelines was seamless and not a bit confusing. Lynne Ramsay, who years ago, brought us the imagery of 'The Ratcatcher', uses what almost feels like a thematic montage with only a unity of the color red as film gets going. But, soon the message of motherhood vs. troubled child is underway. Foreshadowing in the color red is heavy handed, yet balanced with fact that there is no graphic violence. Interesting. Artsy. Hhhmmmm... I felt like I was standing back, studying a work by an artist that had just about, almost...got it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, people have come away from this expounding age old discourses and dissertations for or against 'Nature/Nurture'. Useless! This film keeps this question quite neutral, in my opinion. And, I think that is a good thing. This film should be judged by it's form, it's beauty, and even the emotion it has or has not engendered. Instead, reviewers are skipping to issues of science and heart.<br /><br />Please don't believe I haven't an opinion about Nature/Nurture. I do! But, a movie review is not the place.  3 1/2
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun it has sp many games I play it 24 hours it is like the only game I play
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Highly recommend for reading, not what I expected, not having seen the movie, I can see where it would make a very good movie
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my title says it all. It has great games that I play over &amp; over to best my own score...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's too bad there aren't more books like this. Well written, intriguing, and although it's probably targeted at a younger audience, I still took away some deeper meaning. I would and have recommended this to all of my friends and family.

He doesnt need/use the pacifier for longer than a few minutes, but his face lights up when he sees his monkey. When he started day care I made sure it went with him so that he would having something familiar and comforting with him during the day. It has defintely helped him develop his dexterity and can easily reach for/handle the monkey.

B0086700CM|5.0|Months ago I was searching for this app on my kindle. I was searching for it because I have this same game on my Ipod. I use the Asian girl to run with. P.S. I am L. Howells daughter (9 years old).
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app works great with my tablet and it is really easy to use. I would recommend this to everyone.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I shopped around for a while looking for a case for my newly acquired Kindle fire, in total taking up roughly three months of comparisons, perusals of product reviews, etc.  The problem that I found with most options were that they were over designed and inelegant.  The amazon produced sleeve satisfied all my needs, and aesthetic desires.  It won't turn into a stand or anything like that, but what I valued most was a simple case that would protect my device while traveling.  I know that some reviewers have commented negatively about its build and smell and I can only say that the latter is in anyway relevant to my experience.  The sleeve does come with a pronounced chemical smell but, thankfully, unless your plans are to hold it up to your nose at all times it won't really be much of a problem as it does not transmit a foul smell to your Kindle.  The 2/3 zipper construction has, in my experience, been just fine.  You can slide the kindle in without any problems or fears of scratching the screen.  In other words, if you damage your Kindle with this sleeve it's all on you.<br /><br />In total, the sleek design and functionality are perfect for anyone who is looking for something simple to protect their Kindle from the elements.  There may be other cases that boast the ability to stand the Kindle up or things like that but this one, for me, takes the cake as the best option out there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Easy. Thrilling. Intriguing and lots of undertones to a bigger message. Love it. The best is probably the third book in the series, but obviously you can't just start at the end.
B000WCDBKM|2.0|I only sat through the entire thing because I had read comments suggesting that the ending was \\"special\\". Nothing of the sort. What you see in the first 10 minutes is what you get for the rest of the film. It looked as though Polanski was trying his hand at satire, to be honest. I do not recommend.
B008578PMU|4.0|Historical movies are often tedious, lengthy and difficult to sit through, particularly within a 2 hour runtime---in addition to the complexities of dealing with racial bias---however Executive Producer George Lucas, and Director Anthony Hemingway do so handily, skillfully, delivering a quick paced semi-ole fashioned patriotic action/buddy/love story without the epic scale. \\"RED TAILS\\" has more of a made for TV type of flavor, making it family friendly PG-13 entertainment, so grab some Popcorn or Chips, a drink, and turn up the volume...  GBJ
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy this logic game.  Fun to figure out.  Works very well on the kindle Fire.  Working my way up to the harder ones.
B005M0R524|5.0|This is an excellent series with great characters of both the privileged class and the servants. Each show make you want to see more. After finishing the second season I couldn't wait to get the Christmas special. It answered a lot of questions left open after season two. A must see. Can't wait for season three.
0345803507|1.0|I reviewed the 1st \\"50 shades\\" book, started to do the 2nd, but this series was SO BAD, I didn't want to waste my time with James trio of absolutely terrible writing and plots. So I'll end my horrid experience by reviewing the final book.<br /><br />First. Stephenie Meyer, why you haven't sued James over copyright infringement is BEYOND ME. She's not even trying to cover it up! The characters in Twilight are terrible & badly written but they are YOUR terribly written & bad characters. Have some pride woman!<br /><br />Second. James, I cannot believe people are \\"lapping up\\" your sex descriptions. Completely unbelieveable & poorly described. You wouldn't know BDSM if \\"Dom\\" beat you over the head. I forced my way through all the books & it took me FOREVER, they were so bad. Im reeling from the fact that there are that many bored housewives in the workd who take your word as gosphel.<br /><br />Third. The people that like her books, think they are so \\"titillating\\"! All of you need to get out more, James 50 shades is about as titilating as an instruction manual for those of us who are obviously not as naive as the rest of you.<br /><br />I still cannot believe how much I HATED this series. It's horrible. Buy The Chronicles of Sleeping Beauty by Anne Rice. It's also a trilogy, one that correctly uses BDSM & other sexual themes, one that is beautifully written. Buy that & burn 50 shades.....
0142419400|5.0|This is my all time favorite book I have read it at least 4 times it is the perfect romance and has many interesting true facts it makes me want to visit Paris
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a big sci-fi reader but the popularity of this series made me give these books a whirl and I am so pleased that I did. They are so easy to read and the concepts are not so far fetched as to make it difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados. I was completely addicted within the first few pages and am now looking for more by this talented author. The characters are well rounded and I felt that I really got to know them and could feel their struggles. I cannot recommend this collection highly enough for readers of all genres. Fantastic stories.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this games.I was so happy when I saw this game in the app store.<br /><br />temple run is the best!!!!!!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Great logic game to pass the time. It's like a combination of sudoku, minesweeper, and... Idle what else. So far all puzzles could be solved without guessing except the truck. There was a second possible solution by switching 2 tiles around. The game accepted the 'wrong' answer anyways because it satisfied the solution parameters. Controls can be a bit sloppy. Wish it had a option to switch between marking and clearing. you have to tap a square a second time to clear it. Great free game. Probably worth the full price.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting along time for this app and now its finally on the kindle fire I cant stop playing it. its just so much fun
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun! I can not stop playing it with<br />y cousin! You have to download this game!!!

B0086700CM|3.0|I have played a few times on others ipod but when I saw It on my appstore, I was happy but all it does is black screen then turns off. Maybe it needs an update, I hope it works soon..
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie has nothing to do with politics.  You can be on the radical left, the radical right, and anywhere in between and still \\"enjoy\\" what this film has to offer.  This is not about the politics of war, but the end result of our current political climate superimposed on a fictional storyline through a combat perspective.  Your personal politics are inconsequential because this is a slice of what happens when you train men to shut off their human parts and do their job, which is basically to observe/retrieve/neutralize the target of their mission.  But in a greater sense, it is about doing what is necessary no matter what you want, how you feel, etc.  I doubt that is what the film makers were going for, but by nature of the duty that SEALs and other special forces perform, that is what comes across.  Do your job, do it well, do it willingly.<br /><br />If you are looking to see superb, historic acting skills on display, go watch Sir Laurence Olivier in Othello.  Do not expect Sean Penn in Sam I Am or 21 Grams.  These are Sailors and when the talking parts come, do not expect them to lay out their lines like Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess on Downton Abbey.  That is not what they do.  These are warriors and the real truth in this movie comes from their physicality, the grace in their movements that is a translation of what they do out in the field.  It is beautiful, despite the brutality.  And please, lets not get on about poor acting when there are so many absurdly high-paid, professional \\"actors\\" who maintain careers over the course of years (*cough*KEANU*cough*) with nothing to offer but utterly awful silver screen performances.<br /><br />Anywho, the same people who think this movie is unrealistic and an exaggeration are the same people who think Black Swan was unrealistic and an exaggeration.  It's that same closed mentality that refuses to see a thing for what it is, so if your mind is narrow and limited to personal experience, then you will probably not like this movie.  You have to be open to experiencing a world that is quite unilke your own.<br /><br />If you like action flicks, you will like this movie.  If you like war movies, you will LOOOOVE this movie.  I like war movies, but not glossy, trite garbage like Pearl Harbor, which was terrible.  This movie has grit and edges and beautifully shot action sequences.  So check it out, if only to see what your tax dollars look like in action.
0345803493|2.0|Part two of this story is a dreadful departure from the first, and hardly lives up to its name.  With a title like this, I expected the author to delve even further into the dark exploration of pain for pleasure.  She had a wonderful opportunity with the ending of her first novel to move focus from the maudlin Miss Steele to her title character.  He seemed ready to plunge ever further, immerse himself in the pain of further abandonment, and, given the title, it's what one expects.  Instead I found myself floundering in a sea of hearts and flowers.  That said, for those interested solely in the erotic scenes, do skip forward to those, although not nearly as dark as those from the first novel.  They'll give you some satisfaction.  If you're looking for something remotely realistic from either a sexual or psychological standpoint, look elsewhere.

0307951529|4.0|This book serves as a good *starting* point for someone who wants to understand the basics of becoming an entrepreneur . Chris gives examples of inspirational stories of entrepreneurs who have successfully started small businesses - however, I didn't see any business that used only $100 to start one up.<br /><br />Chris is a compelling storyteller. This book is not a blueprint for how to become an entrepreneur for $100. It's more of a motivational book for those who want to become entrpreneurs. Chris encourages us to step outside of our comfort zone, trying to motivate us in the many ways that you can become an entrepreneur.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book from Amazon to review for free.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read somewhere that EL James was a big fan of the Twilight series, and maybe that's why I'm not so much a fan of this book.  As in the Twilight series the main character is Very self centered and very immature. For the Twlight series I put that down to it being a 'young person's' book, but that certainly cannot be the case with this one!  I've gotten about 1/3 the way into the first book and really can do without the rest. The main character, (I can't even remember her name) is so unrealistically naive, but so typically self involved.  It seems that every other sentence begins with the word 'I'.  Maybe it's because it's written in the first person, but I think if I were to meet her in person, that really is the way she would talk.  I would not recommed this book to anyone else.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|i really like this kinds of movies, i enjoy one more time watching this movie, the action for the movie, and good actors. i receibe this product on time in good condition, good service. Thank you!
0307279189|5.0|In summary, this book is extremely interesting and easy to read.  I found the book really inspirational, with a story line that is both instructional, funny and humble in its core. In fact I feel myself more motivated to run than ever before in my life.  It made me realize that what I perceived as limits are indeed tiny to what others can accomplish through cheer will power and dedication.  Praise to the author for writing a book worth of any runner's collection.<br /><br />... I'm already checking which will be my first Ultra!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is awesome!!! You absolutely  must read this. It has a lot of actions and adventure never seems to end for Percy Annabeth the smart girl Grover the satyr. You must read this or Zeus himself will come  down and say that with his thunderbolt. If you dont you'll  be missing out a lot.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Excellent product. The sound is something good average to good. They are fairly lightweight. The low depth is not very good. I recommend it for the convenience and light weight!
B005I6EVUG|3.0|******YES, I KNOW IT SAYS IT'S FOR THE KINDLE FIRE!******<br /><br />This review is for Kindle Keyboard users who want to buy the Verso series case that is for the Kindle Fire. The dimensions for the Fire and Keyboard are extremely close. (The Kindle Keyboard is only 1/10\\" wider than the Fire, and the same height).<br /><br />That said, the extra 1/10 of an inch makes a bigger difference than you'd think. It's a very tight, snug fit. It's not easy to take out, but you can force it to fit. The elastic straps overlap some of the navigation buttons, which makes it harder to secure without smashing the keyboard corners. You can adjust them, but it feels like the pressure will break the bands at any moment.<br /><br />Second, as beautiful as the Artist series and Prologue cases are, there are better quality cases out there. This one is not as secure as a side tab snap with shorter elastic bands. These are overpriced enough as it is. Kindle Keyboard users need to buy keyboard specific versions of a case, and not a brand that claims to fit some of the larger models.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Keyboard is an afterthought for nicer looking covers. Stick with the plain leather side snap.<br />This one doesn't serve its purpose as secure case.<br /><br />EDIT: There is a Verso kindle 3 case which I didn't know about before I wrote this review. It's a 2010-2011 model.  (It comes both in the Prologue and the Artist series. You have to specifically search for \\"Verso Kindle 3\\" or \\"Verso Kindle Keyboard case\\" if you're buying online.) I found mine at a local store last week. Make sure the packaging says it's actually for Kindle 3 before buying, and not just \\"compatible\\". It fits perfectly. I still would rate this case 3 stars for the lack of a snap tab. It still doesn't feel as secure without it.

B007L96VCY|4.0|An excellent job here with the sound.  It's better than ever.  I always liked this album, but never thought it was great thus the reason for not grading it 5 stars.  5 stars sort of limts you.  10 stars would allow for a more flexible rating.
0451191153|1.0|I was 12 when, intrigued after seeing the movie on TV, I read it, and scoffed all the way through.  Over 700 pages of the most puerile drivel.  What a hack.  Even at that early age, I fully comprehended the misanthropic bent of this tome.  That people should turn it into the philosophical foundation of their polity toward others bespeaks the abject nadir of humanity.
B0086700CM|5.0|The most fun game ever for a technical device!!!!  I love it!!!  it always keeps me busy and its very addicting I always want to play ut 24/7

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely amazed by this series of books, they were captivating, I wish they would stop the twilight comparisons, I see no similarity, except for the fact, its a boy and girl.<br /><br />Also, anyone who is going to read it, THIS IS AN ADULT NOVEL WITH SEXUALLY CHARGED WORDS, IF YOU ARE CLOSED MINDED, DON'T BOTHER, YOU WILL LOATHE IT.<br /><br />EL James, I am in love and can't wait to read more from you, you are brilliant!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know women all over are raving and tittering about this book buy I really can't see why.  I haven't finished it yet (about halfway through)and have no desire to get back to it, it just doesn't call out to me.  I'll probably chew my way through it just to finish it but insipid about describes it.  It's kind of like a pornographic Barbara Cartland romance.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but the games use a lot of points towards the further levels. but u should still download it
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|When I first heard Purple Rain by Prince when I was a teen I was bowled over. I'd never heard anything quite like it. It turned me onto Prince and musically changed my world, opened musical vistas I'd never thought I'd get to know. Every single song rocked me and even now it's still a favorite on the MP3 player. This CD is like that. There is not one weak song in the bunch. Lambert is just superb and if he doesn't walk with slew of awards for this 2nd CD I will be very surprised. Shady made me laugh and groove. (I just loved that sly bit of Nile Rogers Funk!) Underneath just about broke my heart listening. Trespass had me dancing like an excited teenager in the supermarket aisle while picking my darned groceries off the shelf!<br /><br />People give me a hard time for admitting I like him sometimes, but this is exactly why I listen to Lambert, intently watch his career progress like he's the Second Coming of Elvis even though I'm old enough to be his parent, literally. This brave and talented young man deserves every ounce of success he gets. He just reaches clear across the generations and connects straight with the heart. You can't help but end up liking and respecting him if you really give him a chance and listen to him.<br /><br />At this point I honestly don't think there isn't much he can't sing. (FYI, I'm a serious vocalist, been studying and singing all my life, so I'm tough on that score. You gotta have some serious pipes to impress me and for the record 95% of the people up on stage today? They just don't.) But whatever, I digress.<br /><br />Whenever Adam Lambert sings, I will absolutely be listening. Trespass? Grab it. This one is a keeper. This guy is this generation's Elvis, it's Prince, it's Mercury, it's Bowie. 25 years from now? This CD will be considered \\"an early classic\\" and this guy? He'll be a revered R&P legend. All the people who are trying to discount what this guy can do for whatever reason? You mark my words. They will be eating their words over him because Adam Lambert is absolutely the real deal.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run on the iphone and ipod, and now I can enjoy it on my kindle too! Thank you!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally ive been waiting for it forever!&iexcl;!!!!!! this is the best game ever I highly recommend it!!! works great on thekindle fire awesome app!!
0553386794|4.0|My over all impression of this book was that it was a good story with gripping characters, and a whole lotta fat!<br /><br />This story has an army of characters good, evil, indifferent, but all interesting enough. There have already been plenty of reviews that tell the basics plot and subplots so I will not get into that. I will say that while cumbersome, Martins does spin a very interesting tale with the right mix of drama, intrigue, humor, and romance. From an author's stand point, there probably were a lot of characters that the story did not need but for this story, adding a lot of characters for the sake of \\"expanding the empire\\" seemed appropriate.<br /><br />Here's my main problem with the book: It was far longer that it needed it to be. This book was almost 700 pages with the same length and width of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows hard cover. The print was maybe 8pt. Why was this story so long? It was not because that much happened in the book, it was because Martin over describes everything. My best example of this how he takes two and a half pages to describe an Inn that the characters are in for a few hours. Yes, a very pivotal moment happens there that may actually effect the series as a whole, but at the end of the day it is still just an Inn. My over all impression of this in was that one of the main characters spent much of her childhood there, but now it is nothing like it was. I don't remember the rest of the description, but I know what an Inn looks like in these stories. You have to realize the human mind can only retain so much at a time. Very often I found myself skipping ahead to get past information I didn't need.<br /><br />The one character I do want to talk about is Daenerys. I enjoyed her subplot very much. The thing is her story is one that in my opinion should have been its own story. I know there is a tie in but in my opinion it is very week. If anything her story is how she breaks away from the story going on in the seven kingdoms. I know this is a series and her story will probably tie in better as the series progresses.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for people who love as much detail as possible and are impressed buy how many words an author can squeeze into a chapter. For the rest of us, I am looking forward to watching the series on blue ray.ms. I know this is a series and her story will probably tie in better as the series progresses.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for people who love as much detail as possible and are impressed buy how many words an author can squeeze into a chapter.

6304711891|5.0|Please note that I saw this on TV so I can't comment on the qualities of the DVD or its features.<br /><br />This early action packed extravaganza from Michael Bay (who went on to do all the Transformers movies) is still worth watching, after seeing it again recently. Bay shows his ability to create heart pounding action and special effects that are fun to watch, even if he doesn't worry too much about the plot holes (which I'm not too sensitive to either being easily entertained when it comes to movies). The all-star cast is obviously literally having a blast with the movie, and it was a pleasure to see Ed Harris, Nicholas Cage, and Sean Connery all working together on the silver screen. The premise is certainly scary enough (highly neurotoxic VX gas missiles are aimed at San Francisco) and the chase is on as Connery and Cage try to wend their way through the bowels of Alcatraz's underground to find and defuse all the missiles. It's mindless fun and great entertainment for a lazy weekend night. Bay went on to even greater success with his hit Transformer series (becoming the 8th highest grossing director if I remember right) and you can see some of where that all started with The Rock.
B007NESBK2|5.0|If people ask me what the soundtrack of my life is, I answer with one word, \\"Sade\\".  I have been a fan since day one, way back in 1984.  I went to this concert in August of 2011, been to many of her concerts in the past, this particular concert was the BEST concert I EVER went to in my whole life, above any artist that I have seen in concert, this one was AMAZING, brought chills up my spine and tears down my face...the only regret I have of the concert is that it had to have an ending, I did not want it to stop.  I was in my own world...LOVE, Love, love DELUXE.
1423140591|5.0|A very good continuation of the story. We get to see what happened to Percy and we get to learn the ins and outs of the Roman demigod camp. Percy seems to have gained some new abilities that manifest later in the story. Much of the mystery is a bit lost because we know who Percy is and we already know why he is suddenly running for the Roman camp. Those who read The Lost Hero will also know who the Romans are talking about when they go on about how Jason has been missing for a long time. You do need to read the first book in the series but this story definitely has plenty of new material to keep the die hard Percy Jackson fans from feeling like they are reading the same old stuff.
B00005B36H|5.0|After Aenima, the expectations were high, but did not expect the new album overcame even my best expectations for such a long margin. This album is a master piece, or \\"The Holy Gift\\" as is also known.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. It is really cool looking on the kindle fire. I love it and can spend endless hours playing it. Makes your mind want to win the game so basely!!!!I absolutely love it. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!
0060558121|2.0|I could not finish this book. I got just over 200 pages into it and I threw it into the same box I threw Knights of the Burning Blade. The story did not go anywhere in those first 200 pages. I just kept hearing \\"A storm is coming.\\" Any hint as to what this storm is?<br /><br />You would think a book like this would be right up my alley. I mean a multitude of gods from different pantheons, an epic battle between old gods and new, some sexy parts thrown in...<br /><br />I brought this book to work so I would have more time to read it. Nothing profound happened. This book shows gods doing nothing but mundane every day stuff.<br /><br />I guess the point of this book is that America is getting to much into technology and getting away from older beliefs. I think if you travel to other countries you will find that the United States you will find that we are not the only ones that sacrifice a lot of time to television and invest in shopping malls.<br /><br />I have nothing against book that have something to say. But if you are going to be standing on a soap box for almost 600 pages, at least entertain me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very gripping and compelling story and I had difficulty putting it down.  Highly recommended to mature readers ages 11 and up.  Fascinating commentary on human nature and the the fight for survival.
0470876417|4.0|I confess, with the title and the cover, I kind of expected a gimmicky diet fad self help book.  However, the book had come recommended by someone I trust, so I decided to take the bullet instead of to frustrate an emphatic friend.<br /><br />This is actually a pretty good book.  There's a whole lot of placeholder graphic design, but with the physical length of the book, I think I've actually got a whole business book here, with all the normal pages cut in half and artgasmed on.<br /><br />The book is more about practical steps and responses to situations than I would have expected.  It gives a fair number of no-nonsense tools to work with.  There's a /lot/ of supporting examples, and I walked away feeling like I better understood the material than I'm used to with business books.<br /><br />I'm four-starring it because in the end I think it's more a list of examples and a fairly small set of principles than I had expected at this cost and size.  It's not clear to me whether that's fair, but that's how I'm doing it.  I very rarely five for books.<br /><br />This is the first business book I've ever seen with a genuinely impressive set of production values.  (Maybe I missed one, but whatever, this book is gorgeous.)<br /><br />Recommended strongly.
0385738765|5.0|The sequel to the Maze Runner is sure to delight the returning fans of the series.<br /><br />The story starts the next day after they are lead to the dormitory after escaping the maze. They soon learn that their trials are far from over as they are given a task to cross an area of land known as \\"The scorch,\\" a land decimated by the catastrophe suffered by the world. The gladers are challenged by new technology and monsters they have not seen before, and by the inhabitants of the scorch known as \\"cranks.\\"<br /><br />The main character Thomas remembers more about his past and the role he played in orchestrating the trials that he and his fellow gladers face.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that I can't really say anything bad about this one. If you liked the Maze Runner then this book is a must read. The intrigue is masterfully done, the characters are easy to get behind, the story moves at a refreshing pace.<br /><br />I highly recommend this whole series.
0439023521|4.0|There are already so many positive reviews of this book, so I'm going to make mine short:<br /><br />Read this book.  Although the writing style is rather simplistic, it has a great story and is a great read for adults of ALL ages.  Very suspenseful and exciting...you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Now to the negative.  Nothing in following text reveals story or plot points, but if you are particularly picky about spoilers, STOP reading here.<br /><br />There is a large plot twist in chapter 18, and as soon as it hit I knew Collins made a huge mistake.  As soon as I read it, I shouted \\"deus ex machina!\\" out loud, and that's exactly what it was.  It was clear that this twist would shape the remainder of the book, and likely result in the loss of the main source of tension, which was at the heart of the book from the get go.  In fact, this proved to be true, and nearly all of the tension and suspense was lost in the remainder of the book.<br /><br />This book is very good, but I think that it had the potential to be great.  Unfortunately, Collins cared to deeply for her characters, and so the story suffered.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Adele's voice is beautiful through out the CD, a pleasure to listen to.<br />Love to listen to it in the car, makes the congested traffic easier to bare.
1416955070|3.0|I was a bit worried that this would be another paranormal teen romance vampire werewolf story, and for the most part it was. Despite all this, it managed to keep my interest.<br /><br />All of the concepts had been done before either directly or variation. The vampires were all so pretty, the werewolves ran in packs and hated vampires. Even shadow hunters had been done to a degree before this series.<br /><br />The one thing that kept it going for me was the characters. Although Clary was typical in many ways I did not find her overly demure and at the same time not having the attitude that she was immortal and needed nobody's help, because clearly she did.<br /><br />Although I did find Jace tiresome at times, it was good to see a male character that did not feel the need to play second fiddle just to make himself likeable. I didn't really care for Isabella feeling the need to pronounce how sexy he was. If a character really is that sexy or bad ass, or any other extreme quality, the reader will figure it out on their own, and quickly also.<br /><br />I have to say the main villain aka Valentine was a bit of a disappointment. There was so much build up for him. I found his motives to be a bit simplistic but that's okay. When I finally saw him though, I was not impressed. I could practically see him twirling his mustache and he did even do an evil laugh as he escaped.<br /><br />Over all, not bad. I'm not sure if this is a series I want to continue with, but we shall see.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Excellent movie to demo a home theater. The cannonfire and battle scenes provide a terrific movie event.  The story is captivating even for teens and preteens as it shows boys enduring the grownup hardships of sailing ship navy life.  And a great lesson on leadership.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Please don't read any spoilers for this film -- the way it unfolds, it's like a mystery and you slowly get the picture of what happened.  It's a story about true, real-life evil in the world. After watching this movie, I was so shaken up I couldn't get up off the couch to turn it off and sat through the entire credits...I was just numb.<br /><br />I consider this a horror movie, but there is no gore and no demons or supernatural monsters.  Just evil manifesting itself through the years...showing signs it's developing...and then finally erupting.<br /><br />I can't remember the last movie that was so thought-provoking.  Tilda Swinton should have won all the acting awards for this one -- and the young boy who plays her son (not the teenager, but the younger version of him), was phenomenal.  If you remember The Omen and how creepy that kid playing Damien was in the original 1970s version...this boy is even more creepy. You just know something is wrong with him, and I found myself almost screaming at the TV for someone to see the signs and stop him before something awful happened.<br /><br />I've always wondered what happens to the parents of evil people after they've been caught -- what are their lives like in the aftermath? The newspapers never tell you that.  This movie sheds some light on it, and it's truly a new circle of Hell.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you do not watch this movie if you need to wake up early and go to work in the morning. The movie will leave you numb, horrified, and maybe a little depressed. It is not a fun date night movie. The kind of horror this is is not the Scream or Friday the 13th variety...it is somber, sober, and plays out slowly...building to the horrible conclusion you know is coming.  It's the kind of movie that you either watch alone or with someone who you know you can have a good discussion with when it's over.  It is not a movie to watch with a bunch of friends at a party.<br /><br />I bet I won't be able to watch this again for another 10 years. I also won't be able to ever read anything about any sort of tragedy without thinking of this movie...and what happens to the families of the people who caused the tragedy.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of blood and gore because there is none -- but please be cautioned that this is seriously deep emotional stuff and the depiction of growing evil in this movie is unsettling, terrifying, and gut-wrenching.ain for another 10 years. I also won't be able to ever read anything about any sort of tragedy without thinking of this movie...and what happens to the families of the people who caused the tragedy.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of blood and gore because there is none -- but please be cautioned that this is seriously deep emotional stuff and the depiction of growing evil in this movie is unsettling, terrifying, and gut-wrenching.
0439023521|5.0|It's hard to think of something about this book that has not been said yet. Everyone knows the premise: a future America where 12 districts must offer two tributes every year to fight to the death in an arena. The main character volunteers when her sister is picked and she is sent off to the capitol where she will most likely die in the games.<br /><br />I think that this is an important read because it reflects a lot of what is going on in our society today. The author draws from her background in television to create a world of reality television that has gone to an extreme that is not quite as surreal as one might think.<br /><br />Even if you have already seen the movie, you should read the book. You will find out a lot more of the story and the characters.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock is awesome. You can set multiple alarms for different days. Snooze is easy. Has multiple ways to turn off alarm like math problems, etc. Can't go wrong with this app and worth the money.  Great job :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|Very sweet book, I fell in love with the characters immediately.  I had to download the sequel as soon as I finished.  Loved it!
0553381695|3.0|Well, I know I said after Game of Thrones that I would just settle for watching the series when it came out on DVD, but I guess my lack of patients got to me. I just finished the book and I feel that I worked pretty hard for a disappointing pay off. For a book that took me just over a month to read, not very much happened. When this book started out, Arya was on the run, John was deep in the wilderness, Sansa was being held by the Lannisters, Danearys had baby dragons and was trying to build an army, Joffrey was king and I hated his guts, and Tyrion was the hand. Now that I'm done, not much has changed. For me this series is a mixed bag. I'm sure that I will pick up the third book eventually, but for right now I want to get back to reading stuff I can read in about a week.<br /><br />Apparently the books only get longer from here. That's all I can say for now.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a great game and if you are a kid you will love it adults even you will like this game
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love cut the rope it's fun for all ages. It's one of my favorite games. It's easy for everyone.
0385737955|5.0|Awesome!!!!<br /><br />Very intriguing from the start. I wanted to know why these children were in the maze and what it's purpose was right from the start. I've heard a lot of people complain about the language they invent but I didn't find it too distracting. Even after I read it I was still making comparisons to the minotaur story. Thomas and Theseus start with the same letters for one thing. Also the first time he see's a greiver it reminds him of a cow. They are half beast half machine similar to the Minotuar.<br /><br />On any count, I would definitely recommend this one to any who have not read it yet.<br /><br />I just hope it doesn't turn out to be another zombie book :(
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its so fun and it makes you keep wanting to play itover and over again!!!! fun cool even if you just run and get the yellow stuff. trust me you will be play it over and over and over and over!
B003NX76BM|4.0|A book for vacation - great story, captivating characters and plot. One of those books you do not want to put down. As a lover of mystery and intrigue and therapy dog owner thios book provided both. Actually I learned a few tips about dog training.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I will keep this review brief. Not the most amazing writing...totally unbelieveable plot...but fun to let go and read total cheesy , stupid plot and not be able to put it down. So, go ahead, pour a glass of wine, put all your literary knowledge aside and ENJOY.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games, but they are hard to control. There's either a delay, or you have to push hard on the screen. It makes the games more challenging. Still fun though.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The Logitech G930 is an excellent product! Easy to use straight out of the packaging, plug and play, great sound quality - made my cheaper headphones sound truly flat in comparisson, really good battery life and you can plug them into charge and still use them, with the cord attached - great if you run low of juice in the middle of an epic all nighter gaming session! Best headphones I've ever had, well worth price!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put these books down : they were in similar vein to Hunger Games I suppose.  I will be pursuing further in the series at a later date.  Other similar themed books were Matched, and Crossed by Ally Condie - futuristic and fascinating.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|Makes you think, use logic, multiple layers of difficulty, some puzzles are so big that the individual boxes to complete the game are really small and you have to do a lot of scrolling and zooming.  But works well.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|the story didn't seem well thought out,very weak. the characters were disjoined,the ending was a  wordy, improbable, atempt to tie it together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bottom line, great story and you really get attached to the well developped caracters.  When you want to find 2 minutes to pick up the book and find out what hapenned, you've got a great book.
B0086700CM|5.0|When I checked my app and found out that temple run was free I quickly downloaded it and instantly me and my sister were loving it. Truly temple run is the best game ever the people who made this thank you so much u guyz are the best. TEMPLE RUN RULES!!! PEOPLE WHO HAVENT BOUGHT BUY IT NOW ITS HE BSST GAME EVER.
B0086700CM|2.0|played for about 2 minutes.  swipe response is laggy/slow.  this game is nothing special.  uninstalled already.  I'm guessing the 5 star reviews are flooded in by the developer.  there is no way this many people love this crappy game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best. app. I can listen to the Bible or I can read the Bible any time and anywhere. I have let many people know about this app. Best thing since sliced bread!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome how they came out with temple run for kindle fire just like the one on an ipad its awesome!
B007O3BGZE|4.0|First of all: this is not as good as \\"The tall ships\\", you're not going to find a track like \\"Oh my God\\" (the guitar solo on that song is heaven) or \\"Memory of water\\", but it's another great collection of songs. The production isnt as clean as in \\"The tall ships\\" also. The album is a concept album about a soldier, and it's ok but I'd prefer It Bites composing a collection of pop-rock gems with no connection among them at all. Of course there are some great moments, like the rocker \\"Wildflower\\", or the outstanding \\"The big machine\\". But also there are songs in which It Bites sounds like they're pretending to be another band, copying Yes (and not the best Yes, but the Yes of \\"The ladder\\") and even Queen, e.g.\\"Meadow and the Stream\\" with John Beck pretending to be Rick Wakeman; and the chorus of the song is like Freddie Mercury meets John Mitchell.<br />All in all a must if you're an It Bites fan.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting on this app for months for the kindle fire and now its here.finally my wait is over
B007IXWKUK|5.0|In my opinion book two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy was better than the first and that is saying a lot because I thought that the first was awesome. There seems to be more romance in this book and the couple grow to really fall in love with each other. I couldn't put it down it was so good. I can't wait to read the last book in this trilogy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been wanting this game for my KF forever! I have played it on an Iphone and loved it! This game diserves 5 stars all around!
B005MMYPIE|5.0|The cd comes with a dvd that has music videos and other cool stuff on it, good deal on a hard to find import album!!! LOVE IT!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is soooooooooooo addicting.Whenever my friends would bring there ipod in 2 school I would ask if they had temple run and if I could play it. I used 2 do that because I was jealous and when I got the kindle fire 4 Xmas I was disappointed that they didn't hag temple run but now they do and I wont b asking the kids at school again :) :)<br />:D
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love the best kindle game I played yet and the animal is so adorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!candy looks so yummy !love the game!

1933633867|5.0|I've given this book 5 stars because I'm convinced that it has the potential to change the conventional narrative about economics and money, and in doing so can help us navigate towards a more humane economy that better serves the long-term interests of humanity...<br /><br />Debt is a long overdue anthropological view of money and of human economies (by \\"anthropological\\" I mean it starts many thousands of years before Adam Smith!) In his exploration, Graeber challenges much of the conventional wisdom that we all \\"know\\" about economics and money.<br /><br />The breadth of material that Graeber covers is extraordinarily ambitious and though anchored in the perspective of social anthropology, he also draws on economics and finance, law, history, classics, sociology, linguistics, and philosophy.<br /><br />Few mere mortals can keep up with such multidisciplinary competence, so I was delighted to discover that CrookedTimber dot org has done a \\"seminar\\" on the book. (Look for the Book Events link on the bottom right) They draw on experts and scholars from many of these different disciplines to provide some important and fascinating critical perspective. Graeber himself responds in perhaps slightly too pugnacious but nonetheless enlightening detail.<br /><br />Oh - In case you haven't heard... In addition to being a world-reknown intellectual anthropologist, Graeber is a world-reknown intellectual anarchist. This anarchist label is typically used to try discredit him and I admit that it gave me pause for thought about his motives in writing such a book. I have followed him closely on Twitter since starting this book though, and I have heard little to fear from his worldview and much to respect. In these current troubled times, I'm willing to listen to anyone who has a coherent story that challenges the orthodoxy that we hear from mainstream media, business leaders, and politicians. Graeber's core theses feel sound and they are well presented in an entertaining and highlyeducational book.<br /><br />I'm convinced that if we are going to find our way out of the current mess then we need to think deeper and wider than just unrolling 30 years or so of neoliberal orthodoxy - What was happening before was just as damaging to long-term human flourishing and was just as surely destroying our only planet (although admittedly at a slightly less breakneck pace.)<br /><br />By taking an anthropological view, Graeber helps shine a light on what it is about human economies that make them humane...<br /><br />If you're the kind of person who loves to have your moral and intellectual foundations challenged, then this book is for you. The first chapter is free online at mhpbooks dot com - check it out and make your own call on whether it is worth investing in the full book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I Love this game .....but they should lower the price to unlock the games ......I don't like the ads though
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game has a lot of action that's very easy to get addicting to. it also doesn't really require you paying in app purchases like most free games make you do.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play.  I have wasted so much time and stayed up late to finish a picture.  I recommend this for everyone.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|Since I'm a college student, I like the light weight protection because I can easily carry my kindle in my backpack. I haven't dropped my kindle so I don't know how effective the protection is. After 15 weeks, the sides are scabbing other than that I can't complain. I would recommend the MicroShell Folio to college students.
0345803485|5.0|The most interesting book that I have read in a very long time. Loved it, could not put it down.
0345803485|5.0|Amazon far exceeded it's delivery of the product. As far as the book goes, it's a very interesting read! I'm not sure if I agree with it's content, but it sure keeps you interested in what's going to happen next!
B0086700CM|5.0|all i have to say is about dawg time.! this is phenominal i really hope that  you guys use some more things from andriod.!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is one of the most favorite games that I have played and its really addictive. I love it and I think its a perfect 5 stars.  nobody should rate it lower than that

0871404133|4.0|\\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\" by E. O. Wilson. The theory of the evolutionary development of homo sapiens by an erudite and acclaimed  biologist.  HS's evolutionary development is attributed to eusociality--living together in groups and collaborating--a trait that we share with other successful species such as ants and bees, the study of which has been the author's major professional interest.  Early passages compare human sociality and conquest to that of ants--he provides an exhaustive and exhausting survey of latin names for species and  their distinguishing traits and of competing  theories.  There are some parts about ants taking up with sap-sucking  aphids to eat their residue that are interesting, but there  are also a lot of latin category names and criticisms of people with whose theories he disagrees that add little for the general reader.  However, the heart of the book is Wilson's extension of his theory for the necessary stages for the combined cultural and genetic eusocial evolution of insects to HS.  The first three stages are: i) formation of groups; ii) occurrence of a minimum and necessary combination of  pre-adaptive  traits that strengthen group formation; and  iii) appearance of  mutations that prescribe the persistence of the group.  The development of a large brain made possible for HS an unique evolutionary development.  Within this context Wilson interprets the meaning of human nature, how culture evolved, the origins of language, the evolution of cultural variations, the origins of religion, the origins of the creative arts, and his hope for a new enlightenment.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very good game good graphics for a tablet pretty difficult if you don't know what you're doing and even then it can be difficult
B007A6XLDU|1.0|I purchased this app to gain access to my HP8600.  I does not recognize it at all.  I contacted the help desk and so far (three days) no help.  I hope to hear from them.  BTW the 8600 is listed on their list of supported computers.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've been playing this game for about a week now and can't seem to put it down. Very well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited for this game for about a year and it was worth it! It is the BEST game on the kindle fire by far!!! I love this game soooooooooo much!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Ok, this might be the best puzzler for the Kindle so far! At first I wanted to try it out, and when I first played it, I thought &quot;Wow. This is boring.&quot; But I realized I have been playing for 30 minutes non-stop. Boring at first, but it is cool!
B007HO392S|5.0|Just as good as she always is. My wife is a big fan and I bought it for her.  She immediately put it in her car and has been enjoying it since.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Got this as a free app for my new Kindle Fire. Love both the Fire and the game! Recommend for anyone who enjoys Spider Solitaire.
B002B292K4|5.0|Has it REALLY been 11 years since this movie was released in 2001???? Oh my, where has the time gone? I finally wore out my original CD of this album and since I no longer buy CD's but MP3's instead, I came here to find it and download it to my Zune. I love the fresh take on the infamous songs and have discovered new artists (well, new back then) that I've downloaded and also enjoyed. I've never been a hardcore Beatles fan but I am a hardcore fan of this movie, so the soundtrack reminds me of a film that can still make me weep after 20 or more viewings. Perfect music to listen to when I want to feel good about life and view it through John's Rose-Coloured Hippie Glasses. Peace. :)
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|If you are an admirer of poetry, specifically relating to the mysterious elements of nature; then you should certainly love this movie. This is a remarkable tale of a survivalist who is forced to apprehend the unforgiving aspects of nature. LOVED it!
B0086700CM|5.0|Although the game is great, I sideloaded it long ago! Anyways its a good graphical improvement over the android app,.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is soooooo adicting yet sooooooo fun! my friend has it on her i pad so I went to the app store, and it wasn't there! and now it finally is! I LOVE this game!
0452289963|5.0|Though I had to read each chapter over and over for the message to sink in, I found it to be a great book, with many lessons.  The most difficult for most is to make decisions that aren't based from ones ego.  Its very thought provoking and well worth the necessary studying  to achieve a better understanding.
0525478817|5.0|I've been having a John Green obsession, and so far I read Will Grayson, Will Grayson, Paper Towns, Looking For Alaska, and this marvelous book. This book is one of my favorites! I love it! Because it's filled with cute romantic moments. I love the connection between Hazel and Augustus. When I finished it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was just that amazing!
1577314808|4.0|This book answered some of the \\"why\\" questions I've had in my head for years.  There were many Ah Hah Moments while reading it.  I actually read it twice, back to back, to affirm the new thought process inspired in me.

B0086700CM|5.0|my daughter started me on this game.  the background gets a little boring but still fun.<br />please add different background.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool I really like all of these games they are so much fun. I like the variety and how easy ans hardvthe games are.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is a page-turner and will stay with you long after you read the last line. The characters are believable, the premise plausible, and the fear and horror hair-raising.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting to play this on my kindle fire so yet I have been playing on my dads phone. When I got this it was and is awesome!!!! :D
B007L96SI6|5.0|This is truly a great album. There isn't one song I don't like and that's definitely an exception for me. Can't have enough of Wonderland, Wasted Tears, Undone, Free, Oh My!, Hit The Ground Runnin', and Walking on Heaven and this is just the second day I have listened to this album. I now wish I would have gotten the deluxe version, but will be purchasing those songs separately. I will be listening to this album for a very long time.<br /><br />Like many others have mention, I would also love to see a jazz album by Haley. No need to wait too long for that one. Her rendition of God Bless The Child with Irvin Mayfield is one of my favorite songs. Hopefully she gets to at least release a few jazz singles this year.<br /><br />This is a special album by a great vocalist and songwriter that deserves a lot of attention and success.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|This was such a disappointment.  On the upside, there were a couple of good scares, but you sure had to wait for them, and the costuming, location and sets were spectacular and absolutely appropriate for the era.  Otherwise is was really long and dull.  Way too many gloomy stares and pregnant pauses.  I was expecting something with a bit more pizzaz and excitement, but there was none.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great logic puzzler. The easy level puzzles are sometimes super easy but sometimes challenging.  This is a fun game that actually exercises your brain
1579128955|5.0|Despite my decided leanings toward the arts and social sciences, I am also quite the science geek. I may not completely understand the chemistry, astronomy, or physics I read, but I get enough to know that it's awesome. The periodic table has long fascinated me--it's just damn elegant to be blunt, and this book is just as amazing. Each element is laid out with gorgeous pictures of the element itself and its applications when available as well as having informative and amusing tales of use, misuse, and discovery. (I'm still reeling from learning about the true source of dampness sickness in merry old England.)<br /><br />In short, I loved this book and am currently looking for a frame for the mini poster included in the back. :-)
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Best book I read this year.  Not only his personal story was fascinating. But the writer crafted way of waving in the history of the rigion and world event added another layer to the book.<br />I wish everyone will read this, and somehow humans will be able to close those concentration camps. I thought we said \\"no more\\" after the holocaust. It still happening. A must read!!!
0071373586|5.0|Ries and Trout have written a book that tells not only about marketing, but also teaches a new way of thinking about marketing. Seeing that it was written in 2001, I was happily surprised to find that, while some of the examples are outdated, the points they make with those examples are fresh as tomorrow.<br /><br />\\"The basic approach of positioning is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what's already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist,\\" they write on page 5. They proceed to teach astonishing lessons that seem so logical that I can't believe we didn't see it sooner. Ries and Trout show what has happened in a lineup of businesses due to ineffective (but expensive) marketing. Of course, no one knew it was going to be ineffective because it made sense. It has taken masses of corporate black eyes to accumulate enough data to be sure that what seems to make sense doesn't work. And it took very keen eyes to pick up the trend, understand it, and explain it to us.<br /><br />Seems to me this book should be on the class reading requirements for all marketing classes and I highly recommend it. Good work, gentlemen! Thank you. (Ariel)
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This is actually an EXCELLENT film!!!  It is NOT a remake or anything along those lines.  This is an original story with a good plot.
B007JUWM64|3.0|It is Fun, clean, and historically absurd, but really, its \\"one for all\\" so what do you expect...Park your brain, break out party favors, the kids can watch this safely as there is not much adult content. PG-13 has killed this story. What good are swordsman who fail to duel a few ladies...3 stars for 3 bucks, its worth a candy bar and a coke.
0891419195|5.0|Eugene B. Sledge enlisted in the Marine Corps on December 3, 1942 although he was a freshman at Marion Military Institute. He explains that he quit college because he was \\"prompted by a deep feeling of uneasiness that the war might end\\" before he could get overseas. But his parents wanted him to become a military officer, so he compromised by signing up for the V-12 new officer training program. That put him in a comfortable classroom in Georgia Tech, with boring teachers, detached from the war. At the end of the first semester, Sledge was one of ninety men (half the detachment) to intentionally flunk out of school in order to be allowed to enter the Marine Corps as enlisted men. They wanted to serve their country immediately.<br /><br />With the Old Breed walks us through boot camp, Sledge's training at Camp Elliot, further training at Pavuvu, and then into the battle of Peleliu. I was struck by Sledge's maturity, bravery, and almost unqualified respect for those in his chain of command. How different from so many 18-19 year old men today! Sledge paints a vivid picture of the horrors of war, providing a clear context of the larger scale troop movements and progress while also dwelling on the relationships of the soldiers, the details of daily life (from wet socks, to enjoying scavenged Japanese rations of sea scallops, to \\"field sanitation\\"), and countless anecdotes of incidents showing the bravery of the men and their devotion to each other.<br /><br />In no way does Sledge ever glorify the war. He describes it eloquently as \\"brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste.\\" The stress the men endure and the atrocities they witness slowly--or in some cases quickly--dehumanized many of them, to the point that some were guilty of atrocious acts, like looting the gold teeth of a still-living Japanese soldier. Sledge does not spare readers the misery of their surroundings, the terror of being constantly under barrage by machine gun bullets and enemy shells, or the despair at the senseless loss of life.<br /><br />I was awestruck by the fact that as miserable and fearful as he was in battle, he never once expresses regret. There is a sense that despite all the misery and futility the war was still necessary. But what seemed to motivate Sledge was not the abstract principle of protecting the American way of life. It was the comradeship and commitment he shared with his fellow marines, the knowledge that they were going through this together as friends and that each of them would die to save the others. Still, his quite, underlying patriotism comes out on the last page of the book, where he writes: \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for. With privilege goes responsibility.\\"<br /><br />The book is a page-turner. Written in a calm, almost detached way, Sledge's memoirs are surprisingly engaging and even suspenseful. I read it very carefully, not wanting to miss a word, feeling as though I was experiencing the war along with Company K (though thankfully without the maggots, flooded foxholes, or constant threat to my life).t the senseless loss of life.<br /><br />I was awestruck by the fact that as miserable and fearful as he was in battle, he never once expresses regret.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book is a powerful but disturbing, heroic tale of survival against a horrific regime. It is a well written and sympathetic but candid description of incredible suffering and moral ambiguity. The protagonist is vividly portrayed and compelling. He is a flawed character, though the source of his flaws is totally understandable. I can recall no clearer narrative about the consequences of such a morally deformed society. The writing is crisp and fast paced. What the final outcome will be for the protagonist is unclear, but this adds to the true-to-life environment of the story. This is a must-read for anyone interested in contemporary social ethics and human rights. If the protagonist in the future can reflect upon what he has learned in moral rather than in merely survival terms, and can personally grow from the experience, he could be to North Korea what Elie Wiesel has been to the Holocaust literature. I cannot discern from my reading how this will play out for this character, but must remain hopeful. The author has identified what might be the worst regime in the world; hopefully this book will encourage more writing on North Korea for broad public consumption. This is a remote part of the world that concerned people should be informed about and reflect upon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great way to waste time. been playing for a few weeks and my kids and I love it.
B007JWKLP6|4.0|Martin Scorcese's Living In The Material World, while more cohesive than his Bob Dylan doc, still has its peaks and valleys, and the fact that it holds together better might well be due to pervasive knowledge of the Beatles story rather than his presentation. That said, there are a lot of treats for the eyes via photos and video footage that has never been seen before.<br />Its downfall of course is reliance on photos and footage that have been seen if not over-exposed.<br /><br />In some respects the use of footage from the Beatles Anthology seems redundant. Borrowing footage from someone else's documentary to make your own does not seem to be the way to go. In some instances, Scorcese redeems himself on that point by using alternate takes or material that didn't make it into the Anthology's final cut. But in a pinch he does fall upon segments lifted directly from Anthology. Meanwhile those bits culled from the Anthology's cutting room floor pose the tittilating question, how much more is there we haven't seen, an answer those of us who own a bootleg of an early cut of that doc already partially know. Doubtlessly, Scorcese would have offered more were it not for the fact that the scope of his film was George alone.<br /><br />Probably the most disappointing offering here is the footage from Let It Be. Not only is public starved for and denied the film's re-release, but in the modern world view of fans who enjoy outtakes as much as the finished product, the Let It Be archives surely offer a treasure trove. One would have hoped a man of the reputation of Martin Scorcese could have wrestled some of those unseen treats from tightly guarding fists of Apple. Disappointing, not only is that not the case but we get the one scene that emphasizes the aspect of that project remaining Beatles believe should not be made public, the ugly in-fighting between members of the band. It has been argued by Paul and Ringo, apparently, that Let It Be's release would denigrate the reputation and legacy of the band for future fans. Unfortunately, by denying fans access both to the original film and miles of outtakes that certainly exist, they only further emphasize that one little tif between Paul and George, as we see it repeatedly with no other material to give it context or balance it out.<br /><br />Also disappointing among what's missing from the Material World is more footage from obvious sources like the Rutles, a project that George championed and even did a cameo in. It gets mentioned only in passing.<br /><br />Overall, I'm nitpicking here. There is much here that is good. A lot of great interviews and a few moving moments and another great excuse to pour over details about the Fab Four. That it could have been better does not mean it ain't worth the price of the ticket. If you're a fan you will enjoy it!

0345803485|1.0|This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are not engaging and actually difficult to even like. We are repeatedly told how attractive and 'hot' Christian Grey is, despite him being sadistic and having no empathy with the object of his attention. Anastasia has low self-esteem and is innocent, but orgasms on every page it seems after begging, 'Oh please', even when he's assaulting and debasing her.<br /><br />The only reason I read past the first chapter (constantly skipping yet more repetitive sex scenes and self-absorbed internal monologue) was to see if there was any redemption, any character development or even resolution. I needn't have bothered. It seemed more like the fantasy of a sixteen year old boy than an adult woman's, and the writing was contrived and full of cliches.How many times can he call her 'Baby'?!<br /><br />I won't be wasting any money on the others in the trilogy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is awesome I think its five stars worth it is a great game I love it
B0041G683W|5.0|I have seen this marvelous production on stage here in Seattle 4 times over the years, and am just as thrilled with this 25th Anniversary Concert.  The music and talent in this are superb. Colm Wilkinson is still (always will be!) my favoirite Jean Val-Jean, tho!  I also really enjoy the 10th Anniversary Concert. The more recent one does have lots of great additional features--more scenery-type sets, etc., than just them standing up there singing like in the earlier one.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|I saw this movie and I liked it so I bought it to<br />watch all the time,it has good music in it and great<br />dancing too.
B000026OHN|5.0|Recommended without hesitation; a life-changing listen. I listen every day to Richter playing the WTC, and every day the sheer livingness of the music strikes like lightning, the music grows in depth and dimension, and I marvel at the satisfying multitude of Bach's genius. Perhaps in a year or two I'll buy the Schiff cds or the Hewitt. Perhaps; but I'll not be surprised if the comparison merely opens the ears of my heart to even more of the riches in the Richter. A suggestion: Don't let the loud outburst of BWV 847 (CD1 Track 2) put you off all four cds. Perhaps the first time you listen to CD#1, skip Track 2, listen to all the rest, and then come back to the \\"offending\\" track.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|This is one of those movies that just doesn't get old.  It's great decade after decade.  Molly Ringwald is great, and this movie is so fun to watch!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app was one of the coolest apps ever at first, but now it won't let me open it on my Kindle Fire. So frustrating. I don't want to give it a bad rating, because it works on my htc evo, but just avoid it on Kindle Fires.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a thinkers game. Very addictive. Give this game a try. You'll be glad you did! I love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love love love this app now its on my kindel wow this app is not only really fun its free wow I just cant get over it . this app I think is a lot fun -er on a bigger screen it is a lot easier ok now the real stuff this app is totally free really fun and skip to the point GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW U WILL LOVE IT
B0011KQSZ4|3.0|A light, disrespectful tale of events at a cheating man's funeral. One tends to forget the decedent when confronted with the hilarious turn of events at his wake.
B0086700CM|5.0|When my friend told me it was on the kindle fire,I dropped everyhing and ran to get it! MY DREAM COME TRUE! The good thing is that it's free. I &lt;3 TEMPLE RUN!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is wonderful<br />I enjoy feeling like mayor of my own town and making my town a better, more beautiful
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the series of the Hunger Games, devoured each of the books, all 3 were great, NO dissapointments here!  The movie just couldn't keep up, but how could it?
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I think this was well written, kept a person reading to see where and what Walter could do next to protect all people responsible for everything that was done to Laura. You already knew what the outcome would be but very interesting how it all came about and what the count was hiding.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am consumed by the idea of completing all levels and getting all stars. Don't like the English paper limits on reviews though!
B005ZUR724|5.0|it seems you have to wait for updates from time to time causing some downtime where the game won't play. I'm guessing that it has to do with this game not being made originally for the Kindle.<br /><br />I rated it 5 stars because I'm a huge fan of sword and scorcery MMOs cause this game has pretty much everything those popular games have fit into the app. take the risk and get this game cause even with the update problem it still has a lot of promise for a tablet game!
B0086700CM|5.0|i think this is an amazing game that a lot of people Plath this game on there free time some of them get in trouble for playing it sometimes
B0081KTI0E|4.0|Definitely not Harry Potter. Even if you think you've seen a movie just like this you haven't.  Its old school but with eerie touches that keep you engaged.  The atmosphere of the movie sets the stage and becomes a character in the film.  There are frights aplenty but not in the way you would expect.  The director builds suspense quickly in the movie and doesn't let go.  He masterfully scares you with what you think you see, what you see and what you don't.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is so fun!!!! Whoever dosent like temple run has got some problems. TEMPLE RUN IS AWESOME!!!!!!  but I got to edment it is kinda slow but its a fun game:)
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This was a great movie. It was about two people who were in love and if one person forgot who you were how you would get your significant other to remember what you shared and most importantly who you were.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome and is very fun I guess. I liked it on facebook its fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love playing this game while on the move or cooking. Difficult enough to provide a challenge, but has built in hints for when you get stuck.
B0086700CM|5.0|my favorite app is BTD4 u should check it out. Any way this app is sooo much fun u get to choose different paths and everytime its different its just so great its free so why not get it?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is such a great app. I love that I can easily sync between my phone, Kindle Fire, and computer. It's easy to use, has great features for keeping thoughts, lists, snapshots, etc. organized. It's so easy to search and find what I'm looking for. Love this app!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i lrove it vey much than orher apps avail on he mart. i play with it most of the time.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the controls are poor and I cant manover my finger fast enough for me to win the game. Too many ads andthe update erased my progress.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|Each character was on the screen for such a short time that it was difficult to relate to any of them - the only  exception was Robert Deniro.<br /><br />If you like this format, I recommend that you watch Valentine's Day instead.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game I have on my k fire. I have it on almost every electronic divice in my house: my ipod touch,my brothers ipod touch,my moms opacity and my dads ipad! The only part I don' t like is that the graphics are a little fuzzy but over all a great game!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you enjoy logic based puzzles this is for you.  I've only gone through the easy levels so far but each puzzle can be solved with just a little thought and no guess work is required.  Very fun.
B003GFIWGK|5.0|Being new to reading Sherlock Holmes I was happy to find the stories in one place.  It was a fast and easy purchse.
B000002GJ7|5.0|22 years later, I can still say with certainly, that this is one of the better Rock albums of all-time.  I was only 11 years old when it came out, but it still had the same magical feel to it when I was 11, now that it does when I'm 33.  I feel like this album just picks you up and sweeps you away to a magical place.  You get lost in Nuno's amazing guitar riffs, and Gary Cherone's captivating lyrics, and great vocals.<br /><br />A song like \\"He-Man Woman Hater\\" would never have been played on the radio (partly because of length), but it's one of my favorite songs on the album.  Nuno's opening guitar riff is SICK, and the theme of the Little Rascals club is genius!  I love the creativity.  And that's what you'll find on this album.  It's some of the most creative music you'll find.  The guys from Extreme were REALLY on point when writing/recording this CD.  They seemed like they were really in tune with each other and having a blast.<br /><br />Like most others, I bought this CD because of \\"More Than Words\\", but after owning the album, \\"More Than Words\\" ended up being my least favorite song on the album, and I even began to skip it!  The album is full of fun, creative, energetic, brilliant songs.  If you don't already own this album, give it a few spins.
1592537251|5.0|Having seen the sketches in the Seattle Times and loving them, I definitely wanted to get the book.  So many great works in there, and it definitely made me want to travel more.<br /><br />What I liked about the sketches were that they seemed to slow down the action and help you drink it in, something that a picture can't really do.  You know that the artist spent time drawing what they saw, so it somehow makes you feel more deeply involved in what you are seeing.<br /><br />Great book just to even flip through.
1417055065|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love both this and the BBC version. This one is not quite as long and still has the essence of the whole book.
0553801473|2.0|I used to say that George RR Martin was careless with his characters. After reading his last two books, I am afraid that he is now careless with his readers.

B005ONTD42|1.0|There are a plenty of positive fake reviews here... and it's very-very apparent. (i wonder how much they get paid...)<br /><br />I bought this ball when it used to be $99.00.  It's now $139.00, THIS IS SOME overly expensive piece of pet toy!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is great. Runs smoothly and looks great. Very addicting. Also to the person who said you have to select each tile individually, that's not true. Just hold for a second then drag and it will do the whole row
B0086700CM|3.0|very good game can be extremely addicting on my itouch I got over 5 million however on my kindle fire when I gt to higher points it can lag so much that I have to die
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzle game!  I usually dislike, ignore or uninstall the faotd.  This one is entertaining and works great on my kindle fire.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have enjoyed his writings and this one is terrific. Different to the extent it is difficult to put down. Very descriptive and keeps you guessing as to what the ending will be. This is the best of his books I have read
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This was a great movie and did not deviate from the book too much, given we were not hearing Katniss narrate. I can't wait for Hunger Games: Catching Fire.<br /><br />However, since Amazon digital library is unable to stream to Apple TV, I will have to purchase locally. I know there is product rivalry,but with your alienation for Apple products, that are dominating the market place you lose sales for not support Apple products with your digital download.
B0086700CM|5.0|its about time these idiots who run this so called appetite decided to get something good for a change .
B008469DGY|5.0|Beautiful graphics, controls, and physics make this game most enjoyable to play. I can't think of a single shortcoming. Hugh compliments to the entire team who contributed to the publishing of this app.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's ok. I mean its unrealistic. I got it on my kindle and it is very slow now. I would buy another app that could be better but its fun. you could make it better by the way you move like jumping and sliding. it is perfect for car rides but, ...........
B0086700CM|5.0|finally temple run on kindle fire i have love this game so glad its finnally on kindle fire yes yes yes yes yes
B005FRF6PC|4.0|I'm not a fan of Rafa, his over the top behavior on the tennis court doesn't appeal to me - his fist pumps, when he growls at his opponent.  However, I do admire his tennis skills.  I learned a lot of him as a person from this book and better understand his relationship with Uncle Toni.  I thought the book was forth coming in his relationships.  Worth a read,if you are a tennis fan.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|This is the kind of film that defies criticism.  It's light entertainment that doesn't have a pretentious bone in its body.  Consider it \\"Broadcast News\\" light.  The film is balanced by Harrison Ford's curmudgeonly anchorman and Rachel McAdams buoyant executive producer complimented by Diane Keaton's chipper co-host.  Ironically, Keaton could have played the McAdams part some thirty-five years ago.  Ford effortlessly steals every scene he's in even if he is silently stewing over the fluffiness that surrounds him.  Though not wholly original there is enough wit in the script to distinguish it from its ilk.  Time will tell if this becomes a rom-com classic or a TBS staple.  Regardless, it's a good way to spend a date night at home.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was worth the price that I paid for the Kindle addition. I was hooked from the first page and I highly recommend it. I didn't want to put it down. Laters......
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|The wife was down the Jersey shore.  The TV is mine!!!  I flip on the Phillies game.  They're getting smoked in the first inning so I turn it off to watch this flick.  I didn't have large expectations so they were surpassed.  Make no bones about it.  This flick is derivative raunch easily forgettable.  The makers of it don't care.  It's rude lewd and crude and happy to be so.  The ringmaster is Danny McBride who chews the scenery with the best of them.  So pop open a cold one(I did) and put your brain on auto pilot.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The writers put a lot of thought into some of the twist endings. It is dark at times but you grow to love the characters and can't wait for the next episode.
B0086700CM|3.0|ok so i had to get this other app to get temple run but right after i get it i download temole run and 3 days later it is in the kindle store stupid but fun so i dont know if i delete it or not cause i cant install this kne unless i delete the ither one and im almost done with it
0439023521|5.0|The beginning of the book reminded me of a combination of The Lottery, Running Man and the Long Walk.<br /><br />Amazing plot and the way it is dealt with.  One of those books you can't put down, I am on book three in the same week!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Since I Purchased The Kindle Book \\"Fifty Shades Of Grey\\", I Have Been Thoroughly Enjoyng It. I Haven't Finished It Yet. I'm Not A Very Fast Reader. But Like I Said<br />Before; I'm Really Enjoying \\"Fifty Shades Of Grey\\"!<br />I Would Recommend It Highly!
0345803485|4.0|The story itself, was lovable. I couldn't put the book down for a minute. It's a shame that the author is so repetitive. The same phrases over and over again and the occasional word that no one would ever use in a normal casual conversation. But i was still hooked. The end was a bit upsetting but only makes me want to read the second book even more.
B0086700CM|5.0|it's finally on the fire! about time. my kids and I fight over who gets to play it lol and now they can play with me!
B004SEUJYG|5.0|There are certainly a number of actors who are forever identified by a single role (think Sean Connery as James Bond), but only a small number seem to actually BECOME the person they portray. George C. Scott becomes General George S. Patton. This is a towering performance, and the movie itself is fantastic.  Scott owns this film, and he is breathtaking. The Limited Edition packaging is quite well done. A must have.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Wonderful read!! I can't wait for the next book in the series. I also bought and read Glitches and it helped fill in the gaps of what happened in her life prior to where Cinder begins.
B0055V0GQC|4.0|Driving, intense and unrelenting. Raw and aggressive sound. Bluesy. Swaggering. Fresh. Throwback to 60's and 70's rock but with a modern edge. Jay Buchanan has a fantastic set of pipes - very impressive vocals. Outstanding band. Stellar release. Who says rock is dead?
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game! ! glu. does it again with another great game. addictive with really high replay value. plays great on kindle. fire
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is awesome. It's a challenge, that's the biggest reason I like it. I bate the white bird. He's my least favorite. My favorite is the black bird.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been wanting to get this app forever on my Kindle and now its finally here and it works and looks great!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the glowing reviews of this book, I decided to give it a try. I was exceedingly disappointed by the lack of creativity, the repetition, and poor delivery of the story that I was subjected to by reading this. If I could have rated this with zero stars, I would gladly have done so. How it ever came to be on the best seller's list is a mystery to me.<br />No, I take that back. It's not a mystery. BDSM is a mystery to most people, so they are unaware of just how poorly this book depicts the lifestyle.<br /><br />I completely lost track of how many times the author used the word \\"murmur\\" to describe how the characters speak to one another. I think she needs to purchase a dictionary and thesaurus since she obviously does not know what that word means. Let me expound for a moment.<br /><br />mur·mur/mrmr/<br />Noun: A soft, indistinct sound made by a person or group of people speaking quietly or at a distance.<br />Verb: Say something in a low, soft, or indistinct voice.<br />Synonyms: mutter - whisper - babble - grumble - rustle - hum - mumble<br /><br />I envisioned everyone in this book to be walking around muttering under their breath and speaking incoherently. Anyone with ANY knowledge of the BDSM lifestyle will tell you, DOMS DON'T MURMUR! I have NEVER in all my years heard a Dominant murmur. They speak softly at times, but clearly, with authority and control. It is infuriating to think that so many vanillas out there (and yes boys and girls, we do actually call you vanillas) now think they know about BDSM and, heavens forbid they now think themselves kinksters, Dominants or submissives because they've read this tripe!<br /><br />The writing of this book was shameful, to say the least. A book on the low end of the high school reading level (and that's being generous) with some mild kink and monotonous sex scenes.<br />For those who were swept into the \\"Twilight\\" craze I'll save you the trouble of wasting your time with this. It's the exact same story except that instead of meeting a vampire in high school, the lead female meets an unimpressive \\"Dominant\\" in college.<br />Don't believe me that it's the same story? Here are a few examples. Mousey little white girl, aka lead female, has all the males who know her flocking after her, but she just doesn't see herself as attractive. Her best male friend is a dark skinned, attractive, younger man, who also acts as her mechanic for the car she got from his family. Her parents are separated and she lives closer to her father (in this case step-father that she calls \\"Dad\\" because real father is dead). After meeting hotter than Hades older male that has his choice of any female he wants, she enters a relationship with him where they both have to learn how to let the other into their lives, which couldn't be more different. She has to fend off the love-struck best guy pal, and every other male that happens to cross her path it seems, because she only has eyes for the hotter-than-all-of-Hollywood's-hunks-put-together lead male, who just so happens to have billions upon billions of dollars and runs his own multinational corporation at the age of 27. All the while he is trying to convince her of her beauty, grace, and worth. She takes a trip to see mom, he tags along. Mom \\"senses\\" something between them. They break up. They get back together. They're both so ridiculously unstable that neither one can be convinced that the other isn't going to leave them. So they do the only logical thing to put them at ease... They agree to marriage. Seriously, read the two side by side and then throw in a little adult content and you have identical story lines.<br /><br />I could go on and into far greater detail on the faults and down falls of these books, however, I think I've made enough valid points for one internet review and most people never read these reviews anyway.<br />A very serious point that I'd like to emphasize is, do not read these books and think yourself knowledgeable in theworld of BDSM and kink. Fuzzy handcuffs and a spanking does not a scene make. However, if you read these books and think to yourself, \\"Now that's something I'd like to explore\\", then by all means contact your friendly neighborhood BDSM club/dungeon and have a chat with a few people. We'd love to break you in!

B003O86FMW|4.0|I was extremely enamored with The Hunger Games. \\"Catching Fire\\" is the second volume in the series. This second installment is a good and exciting read, and one continues to be interested in, and care about, the protagonist and her various friends. The main point of the series, the tyrannical \\"Capitol\\" government, continues to develop in this novel. I liked this novel and I like this series. RJB.<br />Comment Comment   Permalink
0142418218|5.0|The story grabs you at page one and never lets up, it's a mile-a-minute pacing that carries you along this children's classic at a clip that could put many adult action novels to shame.<br /><br />I am a 47 year-old man who is going back and rereading favorite children's books from my youth, to rediscover them and get back in touch with my roots in preparation to writing a children's book of my own.  This book was a pure delight, its story sucks you right in and doesn't let you go for 142 pages of illustrated fun.  Dahl's characters are a kick, his nasty children will irritate you with their foolish antics even as Charlie pleases with his good manners and deserving situation.  Willy Wonka's chocolate factory delights with its endless wonders even as Willy himself capers and makes mysterious comments on the behavior of the nasty children and their parents.  This book is fun whether or not you've seen the movies.  Its themes of good vs. bad children's behavior and familial loyalty give it a strong moral center even as its entertaining story sweeps you along.  This book will be a pleasure for children young and old, I'd think even very young children will delight in the storyline due to the simple, straightforward storytelling style and the child-centered focus of the book.  Roald Dahl has conceived one of the great classics of children's literature here, a book that you can reread every decade of your life without wearing it out.  May it reign for another century, at least!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a really fun app where you jump duck move and turn! very good graphics and controls. I would recommend this game to every one.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a better film than one would expect, largely due to the talents of its truly stellar cast of actors who succeed in making the film as a whole more than the sum of its parts.  Or to be specific, more than its mediocre script.  Directed by John Madden, with a script by Ol Parker adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of those films that keeps you engaged by moving along at just the right pace, because if it didn't, you'd start thinking about its flaws rather than simply enjoying it for its deserved merits.<br /><br />The plot begins in the UK where seven British individuals (actually five individuals and one married couple) facing their golden years are drawn for various reasons to ads for a retirement community in India, proclaiming itself as \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly & Beautiful.\\"  Evelyn (Judi Dench), recently widowed, finds herself facing retirement with little more than the pile of debts her husband left behind.  Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a high court judge well able to afford a comfortable retirement, is drawn back to India by memories of his youth which was spent there.  Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) Ainslie are also facing retirement with limited means due to Douglas having invested most of his life savings in his daughter's internet startup which is having trouble starting up.  Muriel (Maggie Smith) finds herself in need of a hip replacement which means several months of painful waiting unless she goes to India where she can have the procedure done immediately at a price she can afford.  Norman (Ronald Pickup), a retiree of limited means who fights facing old age by pursuing younger women, needs a change of scene.  Which also sums up Madge (Celia Imrie) who is looking for another husband - preferably a rich one - to keep her company and comfortable.  And so all of these diverse people suddenly find themselves thrown together, flying off to India and hoping for the best.<br /><br />The best, however, seems to be rather elusive. First, they arrive in India only to find that their connecting flight to Jaipur has been canceled.  Undeterred, Graham, the only one of the group with any familiarity with India, quickly arranges for everyone to make the remaining leg of their journey by bus and tuk-tuk, little golfcart-sized transports that can barely carry more than one person and their luggage.  But when they finally reach their destination, the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful  turns out to be rather less than the brochures had promised.  The hotel, a grand but seriously run-down establishment where some of the rooms are missing doors and none of the phones work, clearly has seen better days, possibly around the time of the British Raj which also seems to be the last time it had paying guests.  Before the dismayed newcomers can get back into their tuk-tuks however, they are greeted by Sonny (Dev Patel), the manager and part-owner of the hotel, who overcomes their misgivings with his boundless always-see-the-positive enthusiasm, quickly getting them settled into their new quarters.<br /><br />Each of the characters react to their new circumstances in different ways.  Evelyn is a little intimidated but also a little excited, this being the first time in her life that she's really done anything on her own. Which, it turns out, includes getting a job, which she desperately needs to be able to continue to stay at the hotel, \\"even at Sonny's prices.\\"  Graham boldly sets out on some mission that involves looking up places he remembers from his youth - most of which are long gone now - and going to the district records office each day.  Douglas takes the hotels shortcomings in stride and treats their new life as an adventure, exploring the sights and culture with enjoyment, while Jean wants none of any of it, withdrawing into her room and into herself, refusing to make even the slightest effort to adapt. Muriel, a cantankerous and openly racist old woman, also makes no effort to adapt, refusing all of the of hotel's local dishes - \\"If I can't pronounce it I'm certainly not going to eat it\\" - living instead off of the stockpile of tinned foods she brought along, only gradually softening as she begins to empathize with the young Dalit woman (Seema Azmi) who attends her and cleans her room every day.  Madge joins the swank and exclusive Viceroy Club to start her search for a new and rich husband... only to find herself paired up with Norman who unbeknownst to her had done the same thing, still trying to cast himself as being richer and younger than he is.  In the meantime, Sonny is kept busy trying to keep his guests happy, trying to get a local businessman to invest money into the hotel so that he can fix it up properly, trying to keep his domineering mother (Lillette Dubey) from demanding that he quit this hotel foolishness and come back to Delhi to meet the girl she's arranged for him to marry, all the while trying to find time for his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), who works at a local call center run by her brother (Sid Makkar), which by coincidence is where Evelyn ends up getting a job as a cultural advisor to help their operators sound more natural on the phone.<br /><br />The best part of the film is simply watching these veteran British actors inhabit their roles, making us feel their characters anxieties and hopes, their excitement at new experiences or their trepidation at the strange and unfamiliar. And in the way they each come to terms with their lives and with themselves. The performances are all first class and keep you fully engaged throughout the film, even when the plot developments strain credulity.<br /><br />The weakest parts of the film, however, come from the script.  Most of the Indian characters are little more than cliches.  Though I haven't read the novel the film was adapted from - Moggach's These Foolish Things - it is apparent from the book's description that a number of changes were made for the screenplay.  Which is, I feel, where some of the problems stem from.  Moggach actually lived in Pakistan for a time.  Ol Parker's screenplay, however, seems to rely on stereotypes gleaned from Western movies set in India, which renders most of the Indian characters little more than clich&eacute;s.  Dev Patel's Sonny is the ingratiating but comically incompetent hotel manager who in the end is rescued by one of the British guests stepping in to right things.  Sonny's mother is domineering, insisting that Sonny go through with an arranged marriage.  Sid Makkar's Jay is at least allowed to be competent and intelligent - and sympathetic - as the manager of the call center who ends up seeing Evelyn as having genuine value to his company. But when he's Sunaina's brother, he's a sterotype, the stern Indian male fending off Sonny's bumbling advances towards his sister. The one true exception is Tena Desae's vibrant Sunaina, almost ironically criticized in the film by Sonny's mother as being \\"too modern\\".  The contrast between Sonny and Sunaina is so sharp that you not only wonder what she sees in him, you wonder what they're doing in the same film. Desae has a natural screen presence that shines through the inadequacies of the script, making you want to see more of her in other films.<br /><br />(Warning:  the next paragraph contains some spoilers.  Skip the next two paragraphs if you don't want to know.)<br /><br />More troublesome is the way the script requires sudden and often inexplicable changes in the characters and their situations to meet the needs of the plot.  Douglas and Jean's financial situation is abruptly reversed, allowing Jean to flee back to England while Douglas decides to stay, both of them having realized that they're terribly unhappy together, which allows Douglas to follow his hope of a future with Evelyn. The ostensible reason for their reversal in fortune after only a matter of weeksis that their daughter's start-up company is suddenly swimming in cash for no apparent reason, other than the fact that the plot needed it to happen at that point. In truth it would only have taken a couple of lines of dialogue - one where the start-up is first mentioned and another to explain the miraculous reversal - to make it believable, but the scriptwriters didn't bother.  This was just sloppy and ham-handed.<br /><br />In other instances, the hotel phones suddenly start working for no apparent reason, allowing Graham to find his long-lost lover and promptly die happy.  Sonny's mother, after having been reminded of Sonny's father's taking a stand for her by a servant who previously in the film has never said a thing, promptly drops her objections to Sonny marrying Sunaina.  And most bizarrely of all, Muriel not only suddenly becomes sympathetic, she comes to Sonny's rescue with a display of business acumen that one would expect of a former CFO rather than of a woman who'd spent her entire career as a housekeeper.<br /><br />But for all the failures of the script to live up to its potential, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is still a film worth seeing, for the sterling performances of its extraordinary cast and for the way in which it deals, at least in part, with people having to face the realities of their lives and their circumstances and the choices they end up making as they rediscover themselves.  The spirit of the film is best summed up in this exchange towards the end between Evelyn and Muriel.<br /><br />Evelyn:  \\"Nothing here has worked out quite as I expected.\\"<br />Muriel: \\"Most things don't.

B0059XTUVI|2.0|A woman in leadership...a twenty year tenure...<br /><br />One would expect that a movie chronicling Margaret Thatcher could have come off more fair, more wide scoped, with more scene clarity.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Meryl Streep astounds with her broad character portrayals.<br /><br />However, the whole movie left a very down and pathetic portrayal of a woman, who had to have had some ingenious, often tenuous, qualities, insights and talents to get her to the top of the politcal spectrum.<br /><br />What was viewed was often a pathetic, innocuous, straining depiction.  This should have been more.

B0000508U6|5.0|I really like this album. It has a dreamy laid-back feel to it, the tunes are interesting and a bit melancholy, Chris Martin has a nice voice. The instrumentation is standard drums/bass/guitar/piano lineup. Reminds me a little of dreampop in parts, but without all the chorus and reverb, also reminds me of folk stuff like Nick Drake and mellower Jeff Buckley. Just a good solid album for late evening play. There's not much that really rocks out on this, nothing really, unless you count Yellow. It might be mainstream but it doesn't suck (I'm no hipster but that's how music is), so pick it up if you don't have it.

0887306667|4.0|Easy and quick to read, no fussing around. A lot of large companies forget these essentials being run by their financial department. I would recommend this book to CEOs, marketing director of large firms etc. Theories apply less to smaller companies.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is really fun, but a little frustrating on my droid2.  The screen is to small or my fingers are too big, but I'm constantly hitting the wrong area.  I'm sure for a new phone soon, maybe if the screen is larger.  Would be great on a tablet.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A little too violent for me. I thought it was well written, though. It kept me focused and I don't usually read that way. Glad I read the book instead of seeing it in the theater.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the series due to all the reviews and women apparently loving it.  I seriously do not see how anyone can say this is a great book.  The writing is extrememly poor, (one reviewer had to check to see if a teenager wrote it, I understand why), it is repetitious, and way over the top.  I can't even get through the first book--it is so horrible.  I usually try to stuggle through because I hate wasting money, but I have no interest in reading the rest of this crap.  Save your money.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|I enjoyed Tony's book. It has a light tone that makes it easy to miss the message. And for some reason the message seems to be quite controversial. Basically, this auto-biographical work details Tony's life and how he took Zappos to the top, ultimately being bought out by Amazon for over one billion dollars.<br /><br />The controversy? Tony espouses business success via a philosophy of hard work combined with making himself happy, his staff happy, and most of all, his customers happy. Obviously too much happiness for some people! But don't let the almost flippant tone fool you, please take a deeper look to see and feel the real message here. I especially enjoyed the enthusiasm and good humor that permeates the writing. For me, Delivering Happiness did just that. However, don't expect to find any strategies to copy Tony's success. This book is more of an inspiring \\"how I did it\\" than a \\"how-to\\" book.<br /><br />In the spirit of full disclosure, I know Tony and even used Zappos as an example of great social media marketing in my last book, Thumbonomics.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its really fun and my name is Emily too!! Sorta hard at the corners though..... Well its a really good game and i think u should get it!
B004PGO25O|4.0|A short enough read to finish in 2 sittings, so relevant that it gets you off your butt immediately. It is practical in ways that change the outlook of how you hold yourself back from starting. And finishing.<br /><br />It is by far the most important 112 pages I've read in the longest time. Arguably, ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|I would say it is a little bit better compared to the ipad version because it is much smaller and I must say the graphics is superb! I just wanna add that the last time I downloaded this the number of people were at around 300 something...I look back few hours it's doubled!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I have so many memories of watching this show when I was in high school and college and laughing by butt off. This is one of the original Fox shows when it started out as a fledgling network back in the late 80s.  It probably would have been cancelled long before reaching the milestone of 11 seasons on any other network, but Married...  kept a loyal following and kept getting renewed.<br /><br />For those of you who are not familiar with the show, it centers around Al Bundy, his wife Peg, their slutty teenage daughter Kelly and the youngest son Bud.  Al is the quentisential loser shoe salesman who is constantly tormented by life, his family and his neighbors.  This is not a show for young children, as there are constant sexual innuendos and verbal cutdowns.  But for the more mature audience it is funny as hell.<br /><br />This is the complete series with all 11 seasons as well as some special features (the reunion show and the \\"lost episode\\" when Fox vetoed a show from its rotation after getting complaints from \\"outraged viewers\\"). The first three seasons has the original Frank Sanatra sung theme than the Muzak version seen on syndication, but the later disks include the Muzak.<br /><br />There are a LOT of disks here (32!).  They are packaged in an oversized DVD box with two spindles.  There are no protective coverings for the individual disks, since they are in a spindle, so it is very easy to lose track of disks, get them out of order in the spindle, or to scratch them.  However, for $40 for the whole set, you are getting a lot of good TV for quite a small price.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy it finally came! I would look up the title temple run then under it would say temple run free for kindle fire.  so as soon as I got my hopes up they were destroyed! there was temple run but it wasn't free it also showed similar titles. I guess its a common thing to look up and that's why it popped up. I got the game and I love it! it so addictive I highly recommend this game and its great for kindle fire.

B005LAIHIQ|2.0|So, here is yet another Tim Burton / Johnny Depp film, this time a remake of a late 60s TV show I have never seen. But it is a Burton / Depp film anyway, which means you have great visuals and an eccentric character Depp plays with a heavy make-up just like in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Frankly, I was not much impressed with either of them. Now with \\"Dark Shadows\\" their efforts are getting formulaic.<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" is a typical case of \\"pieces better than the whole.\\" Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, a well-to-do 18th century gentleman turned into a vampire, who, after being confined in a coffin for about 200 years, wakes up again in 1972 (one year after the original TV show ended). To watch Depp's Barnabas amazed by the 1970s pop culture is just fun. The Alice Cooper concert scene (played by himself) is one of the film's highlights.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems the writer Seth Grahame-Smith (known for his book \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\") didn't come up with a coherent narrative for the protagonist Barnabas, who is not exactly a likeable person. Some may say the unfaithful womanizer well deserves the \\"curse.\\" He also kills innocent people like Sweeney Todd. Unlike the film of the murderous barber of Fleet Street (directed by Burton), however, \\"Dark Shadows\\" does not give us any single reason for us to care for the film's hero.<br /><br />The supporting players include Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller, Chloë Grace Moretz and Michelle Pfeiffer. Except Eva Green as the \\"evil\\" witch Angelique, completely overshadowing Bella Heathcote's heroine(s), none of them is memorable. Perhaps Tim Burton is not really interested.<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" is one of the most disappointing Tim Burton films, in a sense as bad as his \\"re-imagined\\" version of \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" And \\"Apes\\" didn't have Johnny Depp.

1592332803|5.0|This was the first of Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's books that I bought.  I love this book, and really it's so much more than a cookbook.  The recipes are fantastic, and the variety is amazing.  We truly do not need eggs and dairy to create mouthwatering desserts, breads and treats.  I have made several recipes to give away to family and friends, and they can't believe that I didn't use eggs or milk.  Everything either tastes the same as the non-vegan version, or better.  And they're definitely healthier.  Finally, what I love so much about this book -- and all of Colleen's books -- is that it is so informative.  She anticipates every question and includes tips and ideas.  This wonderful cookbook motivated me to check out her website,[...], and to join her club.  The book was the beginning of my journey as a vegan, and I will never look back.

A friend convinced me to read \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and the story started making more sense. The book was much better than I expected. Naturally, I am on the last book........??  Yes! I am glad I read it, and moving on to the entire trilogy. The fact that it is a Novel - it<br />amazes me that the Author E.L. James has this unbelievable detailed imagination.

0307949508|3.0|This story starts about a year and half after Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist find out what happened to Harriet Vanger and exposed a corrupt businessman. Lisbeth has stolen billions of dollars from the corrupt businessman using her stealth computer hacking skills. She leaves Sweden without a word to anyone to travel the world. Mikael in the meantime has decided to run an expose in his magazine, Millienium about a major sex trafficking operation. Two of the writers are murdered right before the stories are published. The murder weapon has Lisbeth's fingerprints all over it. She finds herself a fugitive but with her incredible hacking skills she is always a few steps ahead of the police.<br /><br />This second book in this series is devoted to Mikael trying to prove Lisbeth's innocence and find out who the real murderer of his friends are. We also find out who Lisbeth's father is and why she was institutionalized as a child. This book dragged on a little too long for my taste. I didn't understand the necessity of knowing all of the investigators back stories and there were a lot of other superfluous details. I am hoping the last book in this series flows a little better than this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I Originally Got This App Off Of The 1Mobile Market And It Was Great.Now That It Is On Amazon Market Kindle Fire Users Can Enjoy This. (BTW My High Score Was 1682423 Points)
0345803485|3.0|I checked this one out from the library. Thankfully the library system here doesn't censor books based on hearsay. This wasn't as bad as a lot of folks made it out to be. I've read worse. The beginning read like a YA novel. Ana's voice was very juvenile and I was annoyed during most of the book. I liked Christian & I liked the last few chapters of the book though. It ended on a cliff hanger so I'm going to read the next book in the series. This book had very MILD erotic and BDSM elements.

0307959856|2.0|I would like to starts by saying that i have read all PD JAMES previous books.<br />with a few exception the books were beautifully constructed and wonderful to read.<br />the new genre she has started is really boring repetitious and absolutely unreadable.<br />there are from time to tine to fill up a page the same matter repeated word for word, there is a murder  and instead of<br />trying to solve the murder we are subjected to a list of locals and people with no connection to the murder, visits chats etc..<br />It is like an exercise in style of writing for beginners.<br />I am trying very hard to finish this book, I do not anticipate to be surprised or interested.<br />I have to finish this book but it is not a labor of love.  pure disappointment.<br />I think age has taken over the mind of PD James. I am really sorry.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|its was one of the worse movies. too many unbelievable parts. it was like a bad horror flick.  the only thing missing was the teenage couple getting killed while having sex.  give me a break.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|It was a good movie, however it was a little too slow paced. It was almost 2 hours long without any death scenes, with a good amount of explosions, and not enough anxiety for me. Not bad, however before I started watching it, I expected a terrorist attack, not just an uncontrollable train by a mistake. So it was a little less action. Still, this is the movie that I was looking forward to see and it was OK.

The decoy worked as the balance of the German fighters come in and easily shoot down many of the bombers who are not without fighter plane protection.<br /><br />The Tuskegee Airmen are stationed in Italy in 1944 and their duties include flying patrols and shooting the random military transport they happen to find.  They long for real action at the front and the opportunity for air to air combat with the Germans.  They are perceived by the top brass to be an experiment and incompetent soldiers who are given older style P40 planes to use only for political reasons.<br /><br />Colonel A. J. Howard is at the Pentagon arguing with his superiors that the men deserve a fighting chance to prove themselves in real battle but he is running against racial prejudice and egos....<br /><br />This is a full on action war film that has some really good air battles in it that are worth viewing.  The storyline is just OK and the acting is in my opinion very good.  Unfortunately many of the historical facts are twisted and the characters in the film are fictional.  The story of the Tuskegee airmen is a true story of some of the heroes of WWII.  What I didn't like were the depictions of:<br />* A pilot almost asleep in the cockpit while flying a mission.<br />* A Captain leader who is a drunk and goes into every battle after drinking.<br />* A Lieutenant who didn't follow orders multiple times.<br />* Showing fighter pilots abandoning bomber squadrons so they can get a kill and allow bomber crews to die unprotected.<br />There were other items but these are creative writing in the script that could have been done without.<br /><br />Nevertheless there is enough truth in the movie that allows it to be seen and tell of the bravery of these men who fought for their country.  At the end of the movie it states:<br />* They all get the distinguished Presidential Unit Citation for performance against the enemy.<br /><br />* The Tuskegee airmen had one of the best records of any air fighter group in WW II. By the end of the war, 66 were killed in action.<br /><br />The movie sold fewer tickets at the box office that it cost to make.  It was totally financed by George Lucas as he could get no funding from Hollywood for a movie with a primarily black cast.  Lucas also gave a generous grant donation to the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. to create a website honoring the pilots.  If you would like more information you should go to the site and check more of the historical details.<br /><br />I gave the movie a 4 star rating but it was really a 3 ½.  I wish the storyline followed the historical records more closely and used real names of the heroes.  It could have been a 5 star movie and the topic deserved it!r country.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Incredible. All three. Great read despite all the negative attention this book has gotten. Be open minded. It gets you far with this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an awesome story. It's so compelling that I have a hard time putting it down when I've started reading. I will definitely go see or buy the movie once I'm done reading the books.
962634394X|5.0|Among fans of Jane Austen in the U.S., most may not recognize Juliet Stevenson by name; however, they will certainly recognize her from her photograph as \\"Mrs. Elton\\" in the film adaptation of Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and therefore might be inclined to dismiss a reading of Emma by the deplorable Mrs. Elton.  Big mistake.  Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse.  As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters.  She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.<br /><br />I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_.  Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  We who love reading these treasures by Jane Austen are, therefore, in very good hands when listening to these unabridged audio versions.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I signed up for amazon instant videos thinking I would get some movies for the $79 anual fee, but it looks like you only get trailers for free, the movie costs an extra ten bucks. Total rip.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|My roommate says this book is poorly written.  All about (and too much) sex, sex, sex, sex and more sex).  She does not recommend it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Zombies and samurais!?  Great animation beautiful backgrounds and fascinating zombies.  The game play isn't bad either with weapons spells and different allies and enimies there is enough strategy to keep me involved.  All and all a very entertaining game!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly is just a huge talent. She's an amazing songwriter, superb singer and this CD is just another notch on her belt of great CD's. I love every one of the songs on this one. It reminds me a bit of My December, which I have to say is my favourite CD she's put out. I have every one of her CD's and without exception this CD is as good as any. Great songs. Great voice. This was not a let down in any way. There is no way you won't thoroughly enjoy this CD.
B0086700CM|5.0|Absolutely one of THE BEST games on the KindleFire!!!! it took some time, but its finally here! yay! The monkeys will never catch me!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  DOWNLOAD AND HAVE FUN!
B007RI56NY|5.0|Well, I read all the reviews and I have to say that I fall on the this is a great CD side of things. I don't know what CD the people who don't care for it were listening to or what in the world they were expecting. This is the same Train I have loved since the get go. I have all of their CD's and this one does not in anyway let me down or disappoint.  I love this CD. It does have a similar feel to it as Save Me, San Francisco, but I loved that CD too so personally, I'm glad they stuck to an obviously winning formula. The songs are positive and upbeat just the way I like them to be. I listened to it all the way to Portland and back (a 9 hour trip) and just kept turning up the volume loving each song more and more.  I really like every song on this CD not just a few and I think anyone that is thinking about adding it to their collection will be glad they did.

0345803485|1.0|I only got about five paragraphs in before I couldn't take it anymore. Not only was the writing horrible, but the 40yr old British author never stood a chance in capturing the voice of a 20yr old American girl. If that's what people like to read these days, I shudder for the future of the literary world.
B0086700CM|5.0|glad cause now i dont have to use my brothers ipod anymore and its such a big screen. I am glad amazon came out of there shell and but temple run on the kindle fire. Game is awesome.
B002ZG997C|5.0|My fiancee loves this movie. After one viewing, it landed on the list of his top 5 favorite movies. Desolate movies aren't quite my cup of tea, but the premise is intersting, as is the ending. It really makes you stop and think about what you would do if a post-apocoliptic event occurred. Worth checking out, you may love it!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I'll make my review brief. It has good cinematography. I liked the bleak, moody atmosphere of the gorgeous British Columbian wilderness (the movie was set in Alaska, shot in British Columbia). I liked the fact that it was a natural horror movie (natural horror is where animals are antagonists, like Jaws or Orca); too many supernatural horror movies. I liked the fact that it was all men. More horror movies need to show all men. The original The Thing did an excellent job of showing a horror movie with only men can be suspenseful and frightening. Too many horror movies rely on pretty blondes just to get the scares going. This movie wasn't as cliched as most horror movies. So I respected it's devotion to being original. In an age where 90% of the movies from Hollywood are remakes, we definitely need original ideas. I'm so exasperated by remakes I'd rather see a flawed original movie than a remake. I also liked the plane crash scene. It actually made me tense.<br /><br />The flaw: bad characterization. I couldn't feel sorry for anyone in this movie. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the characters seemed like cardboard stock characters than real people. As a result, the movie left me neutral. All in all, I'd recommend renting it. Some people may like this movie. I know many didn't care for it. Just rent it to test the waters if you're curious about this flick. The fans of this movie have been very personal. I've read them arguing with people on imdb.com about this movie for months. I've seen them cursing at the haters and getting cursed at back. That's been the most enjoyable part of this movie. It's good when a movie starts a heated debate. It's especially telling when the debates of the flick are more interesting than the flick itself.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Plus, I had a nitpick about the cold. I don't know where the screenwriter grew up, but apparently the director spent some of his childhood in Michigan and Northern California. So why was his depiction ofpeople in winter so unrealistic? The weather is 0 degrees. Yet most of the time you couldn't see their breath like you would at that temp. They slept without their hats or gloves on and with only one small blanket. If you're in 0 degree weather, you're going to bundle up like mad. And when you're stiff from the freezing cold and hungry, you won't have enough energy to walk to a forest that is a long distance away. Also, I could never get over the fact that the people armed themselves sporadically. They could have made a lot of weapons from the wreckage but didn't. That seems odd. Just like leaving the plan seems odd.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|My fiancee is obsessed with this movie. He recently lost his old copy, and I had to pick up a new one for him for his birthday. It is his all time favorite movie, and he could very well watch it every day and be happy. Take a look at it, it's unique and The Dude is epic :)
0446547654|1.0|This book was like three or four stories in one. Terrible. I like Nicholas Sparks but he was really off on this one. Crazy lunatics running wild without any law enforcement in sight as a side plot. Has the makings of a really bad B horror movie. The main plot was worse. Weak pathetic female character and that is not mentioning the worst part. The plot. The story is insulting. Nicholas Sparks seems incapable of writing strong female characters and his narrow minded moral views seem to get in the way. He could learn alot from Sandra Brown who actually writes strong characters from the South, particularly women, in which the reader believes.
0439023513|5.0|Loved this book.  It's a great end to the trilogy.  Sad to see the Hunger Games saga end, but looking forward to seeing the movies.  This book is as good as the first two, in my opinion.  Really like the ending, since, like real life, everything doesn't always end in roses.  Very highly recommended if you liked the first two.

0670023329|5.0|Escape from Camp 14 is the story of the only man to have ever grown up and escaped from a North Korean prison camp.  Shin Dong-Hyuk's story is moving, horrifying, and needed to be told.  Growing up as one of two sons in a prison camp, he was never taught the principles of human decency.  Always on the brink of starvation, everything in his life revolved around trying to find something to eat.  Everything changed when he began to discover that there was a world outside Camp 14.  A world where people ate grilled meat.  The story follows his escape from the camp, travels through the North Korean underground, and eventual arrival in South Korea and eventually the U.S.<br />I highly recommend this book. It's short, well-written, and affecting.<br />Another Korean book to consider reading is [[ASIN:0307739511 Please Look After Mom (Vintage Contemporaries)]].  It's the sad story of a South Korean mother who goes missing, and the thoughts of her family after she is gone.  Also highly recommended for people interested in the Korean culture.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|I am an avid cyclist and use an app on my Samsung phone to track all my rides.  Unfortunately I can be absentminded at times, like I was today.  I left my phone on the back bumper of my truck and took off.  I realized that I left if there after traveling one mile down the road.  I went back to find my phone laying on the road screen face down with a tire track on the back of my Otterbox case.  The phone is fine and works like a charm, just like the Otterbox.  I highly recommend the Otterbox cases, but wouldn't recommend leaving your phone on your car bumper.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|I must have recommended this film to at least 10 people by now, and I ask every one of them, \\"So... what did you think of this or that? What'd you think of the \\"big scene\\"? (No, I'm not going to give anything away here.) This movie was great because it had the right actors in the right parts. It grabbed my attention at the opening scene and held it. It let me down a little though towards the end because it seemed like the producer and/or director decided that, after having screened the film with test audiences, they suddenly had to find a way to provide what the audiences wanted, so they just threw it in where it might fit best. That's not to say that it wasn't well done, it just seemed a little contrived to me.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally amazon got this game.ive been waiting for it to come out so I can play it on my kindle fire. this is a really fun game.its challenging at times but fun.I can play. this all day.

B000000OMB|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the 1980's.  You can cut the 80's into two parts.  The first half is where all of the exceptional and great music came out.  A lot of the remade music of today, Talk Talk - It's My Life by No Doubt, Peter Schilling - Major Tom by Shiny Toy Gunsm etc....  This album is the creme of that time period.  It go beat up because it was King Crimson, Yes, UK, ELP, etc....  and David Geffen had ruffled a bunch of feathers when he left to start his own record company.  Everyone forgets that this is the album that put Geffen records on the map.  Without Asia - Asia who knows if Geffen survives and we ever get to see the Aerosmith revival and Guns and Roses - Appetite for Destruction, both Geffen talents.  You had groups like Europe in the second half of the 1980's trying hard to sound like Asia.<br /><br />I am always amazed how many people bash Asia, who were born in the late 80's or later, then hear the album and think it is great. It just goes to show perception becomes reality but it is VERY far off in this case.

I did not want to stop reading them. I actually heard about the books from women that I work with, so I went to the library and requested the first one. In the end, I ordered them from Amazom.com and I was glad I did. I will probably read them again.
B0041VV03A|2.0|Adrien Brody plays the weak-minded scientist that is lead and manipulated by his girl friend scientist at every single turn.  The role appears to be non-essential.  As a matter of fact, I think Sarah Polley's role alone will suffice the entire movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a good app but there are a lot of ads. The games are also kind of difficult to control on the  Kindle Fire
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was born in 1983, but since most of what the 90's had kind of sucked I too have many fond memories of the 80's or at least paying homage to it in the 90's. This book was an awesome and inspired read! I loved the world, the constant reference material as if to say Ernest Cline didn't want to leave anyone out, but most off all I loved the characters. The story is typical, one I've read a thousand times before - a sort of cyber/techno land take on the hero's journey, but the juxtaposition of the intertwined stories that take place in the Oasis and Reality are what really take it up over the top for me.  The Oasis storyline is great but hampered by being a bit too much, but in the context of the desolated reality Ernest Cline builds in the world outside it makes sense. It gives us satisfaction in every way including the constant ability to over indulge. It's like Chicken soup for the \\"generation Digital\\" kids soul, a constant mash up of your favorite things brought to life in just enough detail that if, like me you've ever experienced them in reality in the proper context as they were intended, you'll be linked by a fond emotional connection and locked to the pages as you wade your way through chapter after chapter. At a certain point though, you'll become self aware that Cline is playing to this very connection and just when you start thinking \\"is this read turning into some sort of digital age circle jerk\\" Cline really starts to shine. Come for the world, stay for the characters, stay longer to for the insane ending that while great I have no idea how they would tastefully turn into into a film. I can say honestly that about 80% (no pun intended) is movie ready out of the box, but if it ever does grace the screen in the future I'll be there day one.
0307730697|5.0|This book is a must-read, period. I usually don't write a review for books. This book I could not put down. Adam Brown's story is absolutely incredible and Eric Blehm does an excellent job telling it. Share this with everyone you can. It could not have been written any better. Adam Brown is an inspiration to all and shows us what it means to lead a life of faith, love, perseverance and resilience; do yourself a favor and pick up this book right now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book until Juliette showed up front and center.  I love her character, her heart, and her determination.  There was just enough romance without going overboard.  I can honestly say this book has given me new perspective on things we take for granted, namely the truth.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very much like the old school Mario of my childhood. its fun and easy to play. makes me want to hook up my NES :)
B001MTENOC|5.0|Great book on the stage of life between lives here on Earth. Excellent!<br />I had already read Destiny of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton and I also enjoyed it very much. I think this book is easier to read for people that have never experienced any paramormal phenomenon.<br />It is comforting to me because I have had experiences all my life and I remember a lot of things.<br />I always carry with me the feeling of being homesick for the spirit world.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />Silvia
B007M458CW|5.0|The latest album from Dr. John, New Orleans music legend, is some of his best work.  This album is solid from start to finish with songs that have a fat sound and undeniable hooks.  Dr, John's voice is as distinguished as ever and add Black Keys front man Dan Aurebach on guitar and as a guest producer and you have a taste of the classic mixed with the best of what rock offers today.
B001KQZ7I8|3.0|Very interesting book. I didn´t know it was about a doctor´s view of concentration camps. It was sad but I totally get his point of view on turning suffering into a purpose to survive. I don´t agree with other aspects of the book. I am a very spiritually orientated person and I think the meaning of life has more to do with realizing who we really are and what we came to Earth to learn. But I did enjoy the book.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Silvia

1439127700|5.0|\\"The President's Club\\" is a fascinating look at the interpersonal relationships between past and present Presidents in the post-WWII era and how then-current presidents have drawn on the expertise and experiences of past Presidents.  The idea is so fascinating it's amazing it hasn't been attempted on such a scale before.  As Washington reporters both Gibbs and Duffy are both well qualified to write such a book and have the connections, insight, and access to records that bolster their research, as well as having lively writing styles that make their stories captivating and interesting.  Starting from the Truman era and carrying up to the present Gibbs and Duffy draw out stories both familiar and less well know that will captivate readers.  Many of these friendships were based on the greater interests of the nation rather than on genuine friendship and most were conducted in privacy as bringing them into the public sphere could have undoubtedly cause political problems.  Such was the relationship between Truman and Hoover, perhaps one of the most amazing and truly bizarre friendships imaginable. Once ascending to the presidency Truman almost immediately reaches out to Hoover which is astonishing as Hoover was a sharp critic of the New Deal and Truman's predecessor Franklin Roosevelt.  Yet Truman knows he needs to rebuild Europe and Hoover was largely responsible for saving Europe from starvation in the post WWI era; who better to turn to for guidance and advice.  In retrospect Truman could hardly have turned to a better source for advice and Hoover's sage guidance and counsel likely led to the creation of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan.<br /><br />From such an auspicious beginning things became decidedly pricklier as Eisenhower had little need for consultations with Hoover or Truman although they were hardly unfriendly to each other.  That in itself is unsurprising as both men were quite unpopular after having left office and it took years for their image and profiles to recover; itself a valuable lesson for other future presidents.  Kennedy likewise saw little need for Truman and by that time Hoover was nearing the end of his life.  Johnson however saw value in Truman and frequently consulted with him as well as Eisenhower.  What is astonishing is that at this time there were so few previous presidents alive; testament to how large FDR's shadow was.  Pity poor Richard Nixon as he witnessed the death of virtually every predecessor during his time in office; Eisenhower, Truman, and LBJ all died before he left office, rendering him unable to tap into the sage counsel of past presidents.  No wonder he was so willing, in later years, to be available to his successors.  The same was true for Gerald Ford who had no one to turn to save for Nixon, someone he had to studiously avoid while in office.  It was only later with President Carter and Reagan that they could again begin to turn to past presidents for advice and again would have resources to draw from.  Indeed, it was at this time that the full flower of consulting past presidents for advice came to be.  Carter readily recognized the resources that both Nixon and Ford represented.  Despite the hard feelings of the 1980 election Reagan likewise realized the relative value of Carter and his surviving predecessors and set about consulting them in an ongoing fashion.  It was both Carter and Reagan that set the precedent for engaging past presidents and using their advice in an ongoing fashion.  To a degree there is a parallel to how British Prime Ministers consult the monarch, who provides a sense of continuity and depth of expertise to draw from.  Despite ideological differences, lingering distrust and individual animosity the ex-presidents are a group that by and large gets along with each other surprisingly well, perhaps because they all know just how hard the job is.  It's fascinating to discover that they compare each other and their records, yet also seek solace andsympathy from each other and come to reassess themselves and each other based on their interactions.  What is also interesting is how public opinion regarding former presidents has changed and evolved.  Over their long lifetimes public opinion of Truman changed from scorn to grudging admiration in twenty years time.  Nixon was able to rehabilitate himself as much as was possible through writing insightful books and giving sage advise on foreign affairs.  Carter literally built a reputation through Habitat for Humanity and his non-stop efforts for free and fair elections.  All in all a fascinating, well written book that makes me wonder about other earlier presidential relations and perhaps if someone else could mine that for another similar book.sympathy from each other and come to reassess themselves and each other based on their interactions.

1416550550|4.0|A lovely book that tells a really interesting story. The author manages to hold the reader's interest without ever falling into soapiness, which could have been easy given the topic. I liked the ease with which it read (I listened to the unabridged audiobook version and was very pleased with the narrator), it flowed effortlessly. I thought there was just a little too much back and forth between the different times and places, but that would be my only criticism. I liked this second novel better than her first one. Recommended.
1594744769|5.0|I love this book so much that I finished it in TWO DAYS!!!!!<br />I read a lot so finding a good book has become very hard, but this book is one of my top 25 that I keep on my bookshelf. When reading a book I tend to become sidetracked and distracted very easily (thanks to my over active imagination- I'm 15 okay!) but this book I didn't want to put down! I had to force myself to put it down just to eat and to sleep, it was that good. The photographic pictures given in the book really help you to get an understanding on what the author is talking about. I thought it was pretty good for his first novel.<br />If you haven't read it yet, do so imidately (i can't spell sorry), this book grabs your attention until the very end!
0345803485|4.0|The book was great! I wish I could have read it at the same time it came out on the Kindle. I head so much about it before I could get the book. Technology is great but I'm old school and I like turning real pages and using a real bookmark.<br /><br />I have past it on to my daughters and my friends. Each one has enjoyed it and has given their review of this book. This has now become a multi-state book club. We will be reading the rest of the trilogy soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally I have been looking for this app on the kindle fire for free and now they finally have it yay!!! this game is soooooo addictive its awesome and fun and I just cant stop playing it!!!  I love this game and I'm sure you guys will too!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this is a great book in general. The only problem is it is not what readers were expecting. Rick Riodans previos books in this siries had a lot more action than &#34;The Mark Of Athena&#34; did. though I did have an exceptional liking for the choach that liked hitting things and blowing stuf up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|play it almost every morning to wake up. it helps to exercise my brain and keep my mind sharp and stimulated.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I got sucked into the series, like many others, when I downloaded the first three books to my Kindle for free.  The character development, plot, and writing are all quite good, especially for an indie publication.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing, which is generally awful in most independently-published stories.  As a knitter, the title of the series is a bit misleading, as I thought it would refer to knitting more.  Don't get me wrong, I read the description and I knew what the story was basically about, but the title of the series doesn't really have anything at all to do with the story.  That's a minor quibble, of course, and the story was gripping enough to make me buy the fourth and fifth installment in the series as soon as I finished the previous books.  The ending was satisfying, and yet it still left room for the author to continue the series later.  All in all, this is well worth your time and the nominal monetary investment.  I  fully expect this author to have a book contract with a major publishing house soon.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is so fun!  I love the puzzle aspect.  Some levels are mind boggling but very entertaining.  Please make more levels!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I got this and it is awsome only problem is the locking mech is cheap and i dont really care its a cool thing to have.
B0086700CM|3.0|This is a great game on apple and android products. Not soo much for the kindle fire. It starts to glitch when the score gets higher. great game though.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a little harder to tilt since the fire weight is much heavier than an ipod touch. Overall very good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this on my friends moms phone and I luved it and I hav been waiting 4 evr 4 it
B0086700CM|5.0|yes ive been waiting for this for like a long time. Its works great on kindle fire now I am addicted :D!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|probably the best tablet game there is. fast paced, incredible difficult, excellent graphics and very addictive. Runs well on my Kindle Fire.

B0086700CM|5.0|they got it for kindle fire and its the best game ever made I cant believe it took this long to get it for kindle
B007YJS7G4|4.0|Not a big movie watcher, but was looking forward to this release. Not at all disappointed, either, the movie was as good as the previews promised.<br />Portrayed the discrimination and bias faced by these men, balanced with the determination, courage and perserverence they displayed not ony to prove the naysayers wrong, but to do their duty, going above and beyond in defending this country, and the world against Hitler and the Nazi's.<br />The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, was it could have been a little less personal relationships in the end, and a little more reflective of their accomplishment's and success of their mission into--well, that would spoil it, so you'll have to watch.<br />Has peaked my interest, now I'm going to have to read up on them<br />On the this Memorial Day 58 years after these men battled more than just Hitler's Nazi's, Hats off to the 332nd.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved it! Couldnt put it down and then couldnt wait to get the next one. I HAD to see what happened next!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Beautiful & moving movie!!  Loved it!! It was a real treat to watch a gay film (several times) where drugs, alcholism, or the boring bar scenes aren't the main topic.  Awesome love story that makes one completely jealous why we can't experience the same.  Simply a moving film.
B0086700CM|5.0|all my friends with ipods  have it so when it came out on amazon I installed it instantly I love this game
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game is interesting and a real challenge.  It requires deep thought and memory. I have enjoyed playing this game as time seems to fly by.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best. app Ive ever downloaded and one of the only ones because I don't need other apps this apposite de bomb diggity.
B003K16P3M|4.0|Graceling is a very good light read that moves along nicely (a page turner) and the concept is original: that certain people in their world are born, or graced, with extra special abilities. Katsa, the strong female lead, one of the graced, excels in fighting and surviving. She is engaging, well characterized, and well defined, as are most of the characters in the book. The male lead, Po, nicely balances her in both character and grace.<br />Katsa overcomes all obstacles, falls in love, rescues a princess (Bitterblue) and defeats an evil king. In a sense, this is a coming of age novel about her. I found the 'climax' when Katsa defeats the evil king to be anticlimactic and far too brief after her preceding struggles, but satisfactory nevertheless - the story is as much about the relationship between Katsa and Po as it is about her quest. There are obviously some open ends that are addressed in subsequent stories.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is Awesome! They finally made temple run in the kindle fire! :) If you don't know what temple run is then u are lost! Recommend u getting it! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! I have it on my phone, I have it on my itouch, and I have on my kindle fire!
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game ever! In the opinion of a 10-year-old girl (me)  I can't stop playing!! Bravo to all of yall who created this game... BEST GAME EVER!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting a million yrs for dis game to come ouut finally its here i was aging as it came :o but i loooove it
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book (trilogy) is the best I have read in a long time. I downloaded the sample and was so intrigued by what I read that I bought the three (3) [[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]] books and finished them all in four (4) days. Everything else was neglected, I could not put it down. It's a really great read, I recommend it to anyone. Praises for E. L James.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I thought the Hunger Games was easy and fast to read and is a good action story, but its not a book that I fell in love with.  The Hunger Games has some good things that I liked but I also found things that I did not like and that were a problem for me. The things that I liked where the hunting activities. Katniss being a good hunter and providing for her family and taking her sisters place in the games. I really liked Rue and was sad when she died but i was touched when Katniss covered her with flowers.<br />I did not like the romance angle of the Hunger Games because it just felt unreal and forced. I also did not like the mutated wolves and the changing of the rules.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addicting. my friend showed it to me and I was addicted at playing it on her phone. it was amazing. maybe hard at first, but after I finally got it for free I got used to it and its so fun!!!! gr8 app to get..
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|It insults me that a manufactured boy band can top the charts, when the good music modestly takes the heatseekers positions. I can't respect a band when the majority of the songs have been written by somebody other than the band. Therefore, they cannot sing the songs with real emotions. What Makes You Beautiful is honestly a terrible song, and like another reviewer, their careers are not based upon their musical abilities, but, rather, their looks. And seriously, they don't even look that amazing...<br />But, in conclusion, if this is what today's world thinks of music, so be it, because in five years, nobody will remember their names.<br />You're better off spending your money on a good Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple, or maybe Eva Cassidy CD. THEY can SING. And if you're really feeling daring, then go out on a limb and go for stuff nobody's ever heard of before: Gregory and the Hawk or maybe Sharon Van Etten! Perhaps listing my own musical tastes (which are far better than yours if you plan on giving this CD 5 stars -_-) is s little self-absorbed, but children, you need yourself some real music!
0307730697|4.0|Incredible and poignant story.  But if you don't subscribe to the Christian view you might chafe a little at the narrative.  Still, the book totally reveals the warrior spirit through the life of Adam Brown.
0743454537|2.0|I was immensely disappointed by the ending of the book. The start of the book was good ;I was forced to consider this novel situation of a child created to fuel the life of a sick older sibling. The ending however was a mess, like a D rated movie, sloppy and not creative in the least.The author could have made more of an effort with the resolution.
0345803485|1.0|I guess anyone can write a book as is proven in fifty shades of gray.  Absolutely horrible writing!  The characters in the book have no substance whatsoever and reading about them is torture!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good and the games are really fun. there oz many games and a lot of them are fun some are.more challanaging then others though
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wish I can earn points quicker for you have to repeat games many times to unlock new ones.  otherwise not bad.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Accept returned in 2010 with Blood of The Nations, a visceral album that seems to have an endless supply of octane powering it forward. Every single instrument on the album blend together extremely well to create a balanced, yet powerfully heavy sound. Beat The Bastards, Teutonic Terror, Kill The Pain, Shades of Death...I can go on and on about how every song rocks yet brings something different to the table. This album is full of heavy songs that are always moving forward, not a ton of lulls in the action to be found here, if any. I love records that have tons of energy and drive behind them, Accept's Blood of the Nations certainly fulfills my need. If you haven't bought this album yet, then do so immediately.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is hard to put down. It is not only the sex that hooks you. It's the story and the desire to find out what has made Grey the man that he is. I highly recommend this book.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Works well on a kindle fire. Critical that fingers are in exact location for flippers. No issues with response time<br />The multiple games are very diverse holding my interest
B0086700CM|5.0|finnaly finnaly finnaly finnaly they got it on kindle fire my brother was killing me now I'm not gonna tell him.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This show keeps a very good feel for the culture of the time -- it's a very fun movie, and the casting is great.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Did not like this book as much as I did first two in Hunger Games trilogy. Glad to be finished!
B006R1T40I|5.0|This is an excellant Bonnie Rait CD..I loved every song on the CD...The Bob Dylan \\"Standing in the Doorway\\"  is awesome.<br />She is in rare form in singing, guitar playing, and songs that are deep and very moving and also fun and lively.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Good game for good price. Not too easy, not too hard. Very good graphics, a couple twists and turns and voila! Your done! Could have been longer...can't they all?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is great&hellip;every edition is included. I find myself reading it a lot more now especially with the plain English version.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great and fun and everything but sometimes i will swipe a certain way and it wont do anything or it will do the opposite of what i told it to do
1401937519|5.0|Her documented account of her struggle with cancer and her near death experience and its aftermath give us all hope for a peaceful and wondrous afterlife.  Her view of that experience is something all mankind should read and take to heart!  What a better world this would be if we all listened to Anita Moorjani!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun the evil demon monkeys scared me at first but then it got really fun when I bought a bunch of power ups
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Although I thought it was a bit repetitive, the message is clear and, with the weight of a Nobel Laureate behind it, it is well worth  our attention. Paul Krugman is a Keynesian, or at least a modified one, and he makes a compelling case for \\"pump priming\\" (although not using those words) as an effective short term remedy for high unemployment in a money-short economy. This is a very controversial book, and probably will be panned by many in this environment of polar politics. But Dr. Krugman is not after making more friends, he is trying to explain to all, in the case of a failing economy, what works and what does not, and why. Good for him!
145162445X|3.0|The author's conclusion that the universe came from nothing is interesting from the standpoint that it is not the first idea of its kind.  Had he read Jacob Boehme (1575-1624) he would have found that the source of all things (or what we call God) is experienced as \\"nothing.\\"  Of course, the \\"no-thing\\" of Boehme is not emptiness but that which is not yet expressed as \\"things.\\"  Nonetheless, it is remarkable to think that scientists are coming to the same conclusions as those who have had an inner experience of a greater spiritual reality.  This is also evident in other areas of science as explained in \\"Spirit and Truth, Finding clarification of Christian beliefs through the words of scientists, scriptures, sages and seers\\" by Samuel Mann.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Slipstream is not only a great \\"comeback\\" album, it's one of her best ever.  Not only are her voice and guitar strong, but the songs are great as well, poignant but \\"catchy\\" at the same time.
0486474917|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes features twelve stories that were originally released in a serial format in Strand magazine. What this collection offers is a great look into the character of Holmes as a master of solving what seems to be the unsolvable: puzzling crimes, murders, mistaken identities and generally mysterious circumstances. Doyle really set the par and precedent for the detective genre with Holmes as his lead. Many mysteries in contemporary film and book have been influenced in some manner by Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Some of the highlights in this collection:<br /><br />In \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", Sherlock Holmes employs disguises in attempts to find a photograph that could ruin the potential marriage of the King of Bohemia. This story has a light mood and it is enjoyable to see Holmes battle wits with Irene Adler.<br /><br />\\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\" has Holmes trying to prove the innocence of James McCarthy, whose father was found dead under odd circumstances. Holmes goes to Hatherly Farm, the scene of the murder, to investigate.<br /><br />\\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\\"--Holmes and Watson try to discover the whereabouts of Neville St. Clair, who has disappeared without a trace after last being seen in, of all places, an opium den. Many signs point to a mysterious and deformed beggar as the lead culprit.  Holmes' investigation takes them into the dangerous East End opium den.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\" the most. It is a closed-room mystery at hand for Holmes to solve, as one woman's sister dies under the most unusual and remarkable circumstances. With seemingly no explanation for the murder and no real clue as to a suspect, Holmes and Watson go to the room where the murder happened. The suspense and tension in the dark room towards the conclusion was top notch.<br /><br />Also included: \\"The Red-Headed League\\", \\"A Case of Identity\\", \\"The Five Orange Pips\\", \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\\", \\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\\", \\"The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\\", \\"The Adventure of Beryl Coronet\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches.\\"<br /><br />Holmes' methods of deducing are almost always fascinating and entertaining. He is an astute and keen observer of human behavior, and pays attention to every detail in his surroundings. Watson makes for a great sidekick and ally to Sherlock Holmes, and his narration really makes these stories tick and work in a way that would be much less effective with an outside narrator.<br /><br />This is a wonderful collection of Sherlock Holmes stories, some of the most popular out there. A collection like this is the best way to start reading Holmes. Sherlock Holmes' fans will want to also check out A Study in Scarlet as well as The Hound of the Baskervilles, full length novels.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally amazon got temple run! it's amazing! &amp; it's so addicting!! works great on the kindle fire!<br />I love this game!!!!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game.  There are so any levels and each puzzle is taking longer to solve! The only minus is that as the board gets bigger it is harder to play on the small mobile display.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm SOOOO happy that they FINALLY put Temple Run in the kindle fire app store. I've always asked my bro if I could play it on his iPod, but now I won't have to ask. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is simple, yet very entertaining. It mixes numbers and pictures engaging both sides of your brain. Thuroughly enjoyable!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Very light and flexible with good sound quality. Adjustable length is good. May be a little too flexible in the middle and loose its shape overtime.
B0086700CM|5.0|I used to watch my sister play this game. She would not let me play it. Now I play it all the time and you should definitely play this awesome app.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I've been playing for hours and i really am enjoying it! The other reviews i just read are also true the energy does take a while to refill, but an eady solution is to just find another game to play for a while. This is actualy a benifit because it gives a time out from the game to rest from frequently chopping trees, feeding chickens, fishing, etc. After all playing the same game for hours can get boring:)
B0086700CM|5.0|i dont know why everyone on kindle fire is upset. i have no glitchs or lags and its an awesome game(: im so happy it finally came for kindle:D
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I played this game for all of five minutes and uninstalled it.  it never uninstalls fully.  my virus scanner picks it up every time.

0345803507|5.0|This is my first book review.... I am an avid reader of about 1 book per week.  Typically I like murder mysteries and the \\"who done it\\" type of books.  I just happened to be watching the news one night and they were talking about a controversial book -- 50 Shades.  I dont remember all the details, but I decided to see for myself what was so controversial.  I downlowded Book 1 of the trilogy to my Kindle Fire.  If I hated it, I was only out 9.99.  To my surprise when it ended, I was FRANTIC to download books 2 and 3 to see how the story progressed.  This is one of the best book trilogies I have read.  It is sexual, intense and other things I cannot describe, but I found that I wanted to know these characters better.  I read alot and I cannot remember the last time that I thought about characters of my books outside of the time I am reading about them. Please continue the Ana and Christian story....... I will read it gladly!!!! Thank you for an awesome trilogy!
B0058VW36U|4.0|its really fun, but I wish the new levels would come out soon. I made it to the last box in one week. Very addicting :)

B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever all I have to say is get it its amazing. and its a lot better then eny other game out there
B007OAAK0O|5.0|After years of hearing that a technical sound glitch would prevent this legenday event from ever seeing the DVD light of day, we get this amazing film that shows the Diva Herself conquering the elements. Miss Ross has performed better shows, but the legacy of this show is the most lasting of any of her performances. Its a great time capsule, a superb reflection of where music and Miss Ross were in 1983. This show was an enormous gamble, a testament to the ability of the superstar to realize her dreams. The viewer should remember that she was less than 3 years removed from her risky move to leave Motown, was a single Mom with 3 girls, and had a lot to lose if this show would not have been pulled off. She battled not only the elements but the odds in pulling this off, more than just pulling it off, Diana Ross created a moment that is instantly identifiable in the world of popular entertainment.<br /><br />Film critic Pauline Kael once said that Diana Ross' efforts to star in THE WIZ may have been the single most dramatic example of will ever exhibited by a movie star. It was that very same strength of will and belief that allowed for the realization of the concert in Central Park, and indeed for the realization of her once-in-a-generation career.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it I love temple run<br />it is so much fun I love it two much<br /><br />yahhh I love it

B0086T6XQ2|4.0|I really love the up to date idea to sherlock holmes, but also love the old victorian style I grew up with. Now to the point of this review which is to state to amazon, I'm not paying .99 cents for a 9 mintute interview with the cast that should be free don't be tight wad chumps.
0817439390|5.0|I picked up my first camera in the 70's and ventured slowly into the digital age about 6 years ago. The author, Bryan Peterson has produced a book with clear explanations, and picture examples. Many people can be a master of knowledge, but, it is a true gift to be able to share this knowledge so others can learn.  The current edition includes high definition imagery and online access to more knowledge. Learners of all stages of knowledge can benefit from reading and practicing the guidance in this book.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Got this as faotd. Haven't been able to  stop playing it!<br />Once I got the hang of it, if fell in LOVE with this game. A great logic type puzzle.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I can't wait for Season 3 of the series to be released. Everything about this series is pure Sherlock Holmes from start to finish. I am extremely disappointed that CBS is trying to make its own version of Sherlock. I think this version has been the best Sherlock Holmes series to date and nothing else can replace this version by BBC. The reason this series is one of the best because everything about it is pure Sherlock Holmes, the cast, set, crimes, and protagonists. You can always have a crime shows like Law & Order, CSI or something like that which can be really good, but you can only have one Sherlock Holmes. You cannot compare Sherlock to other criminal stories because Sherlock is the grandfather to all of them.<br /><br />I found only one drawback to this version - it is that the series tend to be short. It is extremely difficult to wait two years for the next three shows to come on. They need to mass produce this series because I think its getting very popular right now. Also, do anyone knows exactly how Sherlock faked his death? I think waiting another two years is way too long for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this bible app has everyhing i was looking for. i would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good bible app.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|concerns at first glance were quickly dismissed soon after I realized the depth of SvZ. The auto attack is a minor issue I have compared to the positive attributes of this clever game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think its great. I love it. its awesome. one of the best games I have I love it so happy they got this for aneroid
0345803485|5.0|One of the best erotic love stories ever.<br />I was 1/4 though the first book when I got on-line to order the rest of the trilogy.<br />Can't decide whether to reread it or buy the audio books! Michele
0553381687|4.0|I like the book as such but I'm disappointed because the pages are messed up. In one place about 30 pages are repeated and in another place about 30 pages are missing. This is especially annoying because the missing pages deal with a portion of the story not covered in the HBO movie. I don't suppose there is any way to get a refund, but you can bet I won't be buying any of the sequels from the same source.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this app. the graphics are better than the iphone or ipad.you should stop reading this and by it
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This was a good old fashion psychological thriller that was enjoyable to read. I didn't see the movie before hand and I'm glad I didn't (although both are equally good). Dennis Lehane did a wonderful job at keeping you wondering \\"who done it\\".A pair of US Marshalls, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, go to an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses a hospital for the criminal insane to investigate a patient's disappearance. From the first moment they arrive they are suspicious of everyone. Things just do not add up. With the approach of a hurricane, all heck breaks loose allowing the Marshalls to do more snooping around. This leads to even more questions that they cannot answer. To top it all off, Marshall Teddy Daniels is dealing with the loss of his wife and just knows that her killer is on the island. He's running out of time as he tries to find a missing patient, the killer, and keep from losing his own mind or at least from letting the hospital make others think he's lost his mind to keep him silent. You know that there is going to be twists and turns but when they happen you really can't imagine that the happen the way they do. The entire first two-thirds of the book lays out an intricate world and sets up a great plot only to be completely spun out of control in the last third in a very good way. The book ends with you in just amazement. Trying to understand everything that happened and coming to terms with it. Well written and creatively crafted to keep you turning page after page. I would read it again just to see what I missed.
0345803485|5.0|Great book..since there was such a hype about it, I had to order it and enjoyed it.  I'm not a romance novel person and I liked this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't wait to read the next two.  I saw the movie and now am waiting till the next one comes out.  I will re-read the books before the next movies comes out.  This was a favorite with the people I work with.

B0086213XW|4.0|After watching Sarah Polley's gorgeous film Take This Waltz written and directed by Sarah,  i will definitely be anticipating her future films.  Michelle Williams is fantastic as always and this really is a film that will leave you thinking long after having watched it.

B000062Y98|5.0|I have been a huge BG fan ever since I heard the Fly single from their 2006 opus \\"A Twist in the Myth\\" (which did not fare well with most fans, but I enjoyed it). I have went on to buy much of their stuff on iTunes, however once I created an Amazon account, I decided to get Nightfall in Middle Earth and A Night at the Opera (since it's not available on iTunes) and have been much enthralled with both (my two favorite albums from the band), but particularly the latter. Blind Guardian have truly outdone themselves on this release, the spellbinding guitar work from Andre Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, Thomen's skillful and precise drumming (a shame he left because of this record though), the gorgeous orchestrations, and do I have to mention the multiple layers of Hansi's glorious voice? This album took a bit of time upon first listening, but with each repeated listen, I kept finding more and more to adore about this release, and I still do. This for me is Blind Guardian's masterpiece by far, every song is a tremendous work of art. How often can a band write a nearly 15 minute song that actually beats out the classic Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden with absolute ease? And Then There Was Silence is my favorite song by the band, and is probably my favorite song ever written. From front to back, this album shines like gold. It goes without saying that this CD is one of the biggest and most treasured pieces of my CD collection (have over 100 at the moment). Everyone should spend a night at the opera, for their life may change forever.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I gave this novel three stars since, for me, it was a fun read, so it deserves at least as much. However, I have to admit that I am biased; I live in Luxembourg, so there was, for me, the added interest of reading about places I know and have been to hundreds of times, and of trying to spot the howlers. Speaking of which, there are plenty of those. I think Chris Pavone will probably be banned from ever visiting the country again by the Grand Ducal government: secret, no-name number-only accounts such as the ones that play a prominent part in the book are simply not supposed to exist in Luxembourg, and probably don't. The government won't at all appreciate anyone asserting the contrary. Also, the whole point of the FBI operation would probably be lost on the locals. If the FBI thought one of the main characters had committed a crime, and went even to the trouble of telling Interpol about it, surely the first thing to do would be to apply, through official channels for, and get, all of that person's bank records? Not to say freeze his assets immediately, pending investigations.<br /><br />More minor errors abound as well: The Grand Duke is never in residence in the Grand Ducal palace in the city, that's just his office, he lives outside of the city. Belle Etoile, the shopping centre where the two women characters get drenched to the bone running across the open air car park to the gates does have an underground parking facility as well, which sensible people prefer when it is pouring down with rain. And so on and so forth. Oh, and before I forget, very very few people actually live in the old city centre, so it is very surprising that the two couples that make up the novel's main characters do so.<br /><br />Such small errors in details are not a major problem for people who don't know Luxembourg, but I'm afraid that they are the surface tip of quite a bit of superficiality. There are hardly any locals in the novel; one would be forgiven for thinking Luxembourg is exclusively populated by expats, apart from stangely stubborn waiters in caf&eacute;s and restaurants, who will only react to French. The author even manages to call the local language Luxembourgeois (in French), in place of the more common 'Luxembourgish'. Caricatures abound (such as the French policeman, in another part of the book, chatting up a pretty girl and oblivious to the traffic chaos developing around him) and one can't help but feeling that the novel betrays a somewhat simplistic and prejudiced view of 'those strange Europeans' from an American.<br /><br />I also found the novel's structure somewhat difficult to follow: action takes place on three levels: today (Paris), a year or so ago (Luxembourg), further back in the past (the States): there is a constant back and forth between chapters, which is somewhat difficult to follow and tiring. Without wishing to give too many spoilers away, I'd say the end, when all falls into place, is quite improbable. One of the novel's assets is that just when you thought you knew everything, there is a further major twist down the plot. But the downsides of that are, first, that you have to get pretty near the novel's end to get to the stage where you believe you know everything and, before you have time to let this sink in, the next twist arrives and, second, there are irritatingly far too many pointers at various stages in the novel about the fact that all is not what it seems, and this ends up spoiling the fun.<br /><br />Still, I don't regret buying this.lusively populated by expats, apart from stangely stubborn waiters in cafés and restaurants, who will only react to French.

B007BLDFWG|2.0|We were excited to finally see this movie, which had an interesting premise and cast. But what started with alot of promise built on good dialogue and character development ended with what could be described as a quit. Literally, you get the sense that the director and writer just decided they couldn't fit the story into the budget or had gotten themselves in too deep and just wanted to wrap it up. Based on that alone, I wouldn't recommend the movie. The feeling of disappointment is just too great.

0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman has written an excellent book that should become required reading for every member of US Congress.  It can also be understood by people, who care, are unbiased, and do not accept doctrines a priori and without analysis.<br /><br />It is well written without too much jargon.  Krugman suggests many practical solutions for dealing with the terrible consequences of a worldwide economic slump that an excessively greedy, U.S. financial industry has inflicted upon the world's economies.  He avoids dealing with issues that get too deep into partisan politics and he refuses to analyze the unbelievable political power that the financial industry has acquired with financial \\"rewards\\" to politicians aligned with the financial industry's demands.  The ugly and utterly deplorable repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and its replacement by the bipartisan Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is worth a book or an investigative report on its own \\"merits\\".<br /><br />His analysis of the causes of the U.S. economy woes is incisive, inclusive, and very informative.  His plan for getting the U.S. economy out of its present stupor lacks \\"shovel ready\\" projects and ideas.  Some related issues were treated barely or not at all.  Nevertheless, Dr. Krugman's book is a singularly important contribution to accelerating the much needed recovery from the damage our banks have heaped onto the USA's standing in the global economy and to the quality of life of the average U.S. citizen.<br /><br />Some items that are missing from Krugman's otherwise excellent, clarifying, and new-ground-breaking book are:<br /><br />o He never explored how big the GDP contribution of the financial industry actually is; this industry receives huge support from government and taxpayers while its actual contribution to the national economy remains cloaked in mystery<br /><br />o We already know that economic losses, resulting from irresponsible behavior of the financial industry run into the tens of trillions; what needs to be done to avoid the next, potentially even larger financial crisis?<br /><br />o He never mentions the sorry state that the SCIENCE of economy is in; mathematical models are useless when irrational human behavior is part of the modeled process and when common sense is replaced by doctrines at odds with factual data<br /><br />o He studiously avoids to give his estimate for the amount of stimulus that was actually needed for stabilizing demand at the end of the Bush term; how does 2 trillion sound?<br /><br />o He did not put the blame of our existing troubles on those, who were partly responsible like Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Rubin, Paulson, etc.<br /><br />o He never tackled the ugly subject of unavoidable and economically mandatory redistribution of incomes<br /><br />o He did not address the subject of increasing instability of financial markets<br /><br />o He blames the slow recovery on the \\"liquidity trap\\" without suggesting effective countermeasures<br /><br />o He suggests that lacking demand is at the foundation of our economic woes<br /><br />o He does not give a clear solution for solving the imploding demand puzzle<br /><br />o He never mentions the overpowering role that the lack of disposable income, defined as the dollars left after paying taxes, food, fuel, insurances, and contributing to the education of children, has for the lower ranks of the Middle Class and of the unemployed and how this amount effects the national demand of goods and services<br /><br />o He never mentions the terrible toll that uncontrolled and unavoidable medical costs have on the disposable income of families with aging breadwinners<br /><br />o He never addresses the total neglect of reducing unemployment by the Fed (after all it is the second of their two major missions; the first one being the maintenance of a low inflation rate)<br /><br />o He admits that the Fed's initial focus on inflation and on subsequent flooding the national economy with \\"printing\\" money has shownto be ineffective<br /><br />o He never stumbles over the idiosyncrasy of the Fed's inability to act on its two missions; the Fed admits that it is incapable of stimulating demand to increase modest inflation and it has factually abdicated its mission of reducing unemployment completely<br /><br />o He does not discuss what national debt levels are safe; however, he states clearly and convincingly that debt issued in US Dollars does not have the same negative impact as debt taken in other countries' currencies<br /><br />o He does not expand on his observation that the huge unemployment after the Great Depression did not result in an army of unemployables; unemployment was eradicated at the moment the economy was stimulated by defense expenditures and by recruiting after Pearl Harbor had been attacked and after the begin of World War II<br /><br />o He never explores why the waging of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars did not have the same effect<br /><br />o He never addresses the issue of financial stability improvements; drivers of automobiles try to brake when an idiot runs a red light, financial institutions promote financial uncertainty and instability to reap maximum rewards from frightened politicians and taxpayers<br /><br />o He never discusses the easy give-away of more than $700 billion to banks and the fact that a large part of that money was converted into huge, lowly taxed executive bonuses<br /><br />Since Professor Krugman is hopefully continuing his writing for the New York Times, one can reasonably expect that he will review some of these omissions in due time.  I am looking forward to the wisdom and intellectual clarity dispensed by one of the few economists, who truly deserved the Nobel Prize and the lasting esteem that comes with it.to be ineffective<br /><br />o He never stumbles over the idiosyncrasy of the Fed's inability to act on its two missions; the Fed admits that it is incapable of stimulating demand to increase modest inflation and it has factually abdicated its mission of reducing unemployment completely<br /><br />o He does not discuss what national debt levels are safe; however, he states clearly and convincingly that debt issued in US Dollars does not have the same negative impact as debt taken in other countries' currencies<br /><br />o He does not expand on his observation that the huge unemployment after the Great Depression did not result in an army of unemployables; unemployment was eradicated at the moment the economy was stimulated by defense expenditures and by recruiting after Pearl Harbor had been attacked and after the begin of World War II<br /><br />o He never explores why the waging of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars did not have the same effect<br /><br />o He never addresses the issue of financial stability improvements; drivers of automobiles try to brake when an idiot runs a red light, financial institutions promote financial uncertainty and instability to reap maximum rewards from frightened politicians and taxpayers<br /><br />o He never discusses the easy give-away of more than $700 billion to banks and the fact that a large part of that money was converted into huge, lowly taxed executive bonuses<br /><br />Since Professor Krugman is hopefully continuing his writing for the New York Times, one can reasonably expect that he will review some of these omissions in due time.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN is as relevant today as it was during its initial publication in 1818.  The story, butchered by Hollywood renditions, chronicles a young doctor Frankenstein who discovers how to reanimate life.  He attempts to create the perfect being: tall, athletic, and free from disease.  Instead, when the being comes to life, the result is hideous and grotesque.  The doctor flees his lab and his creation only to find his life haunted by his rejected creation.  Modern retellings of this story hold that the monster (who is often inappropriately called \\"Frankenstein\\",) is a lumbering idiot who is afraid of fire.  These versions focus on the horror of the monster.  The 1818 version of Frankenstein's creation is a smart, nimble creature who has become a wretch after finding rejection at every corner of the world.<br /><br />Shelley's original narrative focuses on the horror of being rejected or cast out of the world.  The book often references and evokes Milton's PARADISE LOST, and for good reason.  There are similar themes at work here -- similar ideas about creation, rejection, and the yearning to find meaning in our lives.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is a pretty good public domain copy.  The formatting is great.  There's two introductions: one from Wendy Steiner, and another from the author herself.  There are a few instances in which letters and characters did not translate correctly to the electronic edition (some ol's that format as d's, etc).  Other than a few instances of this, this version is very readable and contains few errors.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who has even a cursory interest in FRANKENSTEIN -- the tale told here is infinitely more interesting and fascinating than the monsters of Hollywood.  Because FRANKENSTEIN is available through the public domain, Amazon is offering this eBook for free.  It's easier to access this great book now than it ever has been before.  What are you waiting for?

0345803485|5.0|I was skeptical when I read all of the reviews.  I saw how it was disturbing, poorly written, had too much lip biting, and readers being tired of hearing about Ana's \\"inner goddess.\\"<br />I must say, this book grabbed a hold of me at the start, and the grip just got tighter as the book went on.  The book is a good read, especially if you are looking for pure entertainment.<br />The lip biting is a nervous habit.  Most of us have one, and if someone wrote a book about us, it would show up repeatedly.  It didn't bother me.<br />Last, I though the \\"inner goddess\\" was clever.  It was a way of showing the struggle between  Ana's sexual side (inner goddess) and her rational side (subconscious).<br /><br />All in all, I WOULD recommend it to anyone, so they could form their own opinion!!!  I am disappointed I didn't buy all three at once (because I was skeptical).  Now I have to wait two days for shipping, before I can start the next one!!

B0071K5KWU|4.0|Familiarity with Tony Banks as a founding member and keyboardist for Genesis, while illuminating, isn't the whole story to his new release, Six Pieces for Orchestra. As with other musicians of his era who have made the transition to orchestral scoring, Banks shows an altogether unfamiliar side in these compositions. His second release, preceded by the successful Seven, takes us on a sonic tour of ideas unexplored in his more familiar art rock/prog/pop world, evoking strong imagery all along the way.<br /><br />From the opening, I glanced up at my TV to ensure I wasn't actually dialed into a movie I'd left in the Blu-Ray player. A quick check of inputs showed I was indeed dialed into the analog outputs of my SACD player. Such is the sweeping cinematic feel of this disc. In part, this would owe to the orchestration work of Paul Englishby, who translated these works from the original piano compositions. An accomplished composer and orchestrator himself, Englishby utilizes a broad palette in realizing Banks' works in concert with the City of Prague Philharmonic. Any expectation of Banks' complex but familiar modalities should be suspended, as these works are rooted in an altogether different yet equally well thought set of ideas.<br /><br />Liner notes have Banks describing the pieces a \\"seductress, journey, hero, quest, decision and goal\\". Subsequent listening sessions after reading the notes were illuminated by these themes, but they are by no means necessary to evoke visual imaginings of the music - these are present throughout.<br /><br />The two pieces featuring soloists Charlie Siem on violin and Martin Robertson on alto saxophone are interesting in maintaining the broad orchestral appeal while serving the soloist. In service to both soloists, the shorter length of each work allows a balance of melody and accompaniment throughout that would ebb and flow far more in longer pieces.<br /><br />For those fans of film composers, from the contemporary such as Danny Elfman, to the more classic works of Maurice Jarre, Tony Banks Six would be a surprising adventure. Those those who come to these works by other means, they are nonetheless compelling musical vignettes.

0345803485|5.0|After many weeks of listening and watching reviews about the book, I thought \\"Hey why not give it a shot?\\" I have long been a fan of Henry Miller, Anais Nin, and Marguarite Duras. Erotica just doesn't phase me...I like how it gives you a deeper look into the characters strengths and weaknesses. Finally, it took an episode of Dr Oz to turn me onto the book. For Mother's Day I received it as a gift. Within three days I had read over 300 pages. I could not put it down. Mind you, it did seem a little cheesy at first (20 something year old virgin, barely kissed meets domineering multi-billionaire with a dungeon of sorts). I got past that and didn't even skip to the juicy parts. I got to know the characters and could relate with Anastasia a little bit. She's neurotic, speaks her mind, but likable. Christian Grey on the other hand was a whole 'nother story. He seemed pompous, arrogant, just down right \\"a-hole\\" material. Then you get to see how enamored he is over this young woman and how he takes a chance with her. There are some who believe the little things count when you begin a relationship with someone. You as the reader, you have to take those into account. The author, E. L. James, makes that easy on you. She shows you tidbits about the characters that help, rather than hurt the story. And sure, I know you will love the filth if that is your thing, but it makes that filth actually seem just right. Remember: it's an erotic tale, not a love story. Do not get them mixed up.

B0073PZIYI|4.0|I gotta say, In Time intrigued me with its neat concept of time as currency and also as a person's own life clock. I agree with some of the other reviews that say the concept was great but the execution was poor. It could have been so much better.<br /><br />Some of the areas that they could have focused on more or better:<br /><br />1. Fleshing out characters. They kept mentioning characters without going into enough detail to make them seem important to audience members or even the main characters themselves. For instance, the main character Will Salis (played by Justin Timberlake) mentions his father once or twice and talks about his father with this timekeeper, the cops of this world, but these \\"conversations\\" are all hints at what his father did and how significant he was. The way the story was going, I expected that the main characters would discover this big conspiracy related to Will's father and then Will would avenge him by succeeding where he failed. Will mentions that he thinks his father was killed, but then there was no truth uncovered about it.<br /><br />Another example is the main \\"bad guy\\", the father of Amanda Seyfried's character, Sylvia. He is this rich tycoon who wouldn't spare a cent for his own daughter for the sake of the time \\"markets.\\" He has conversations with mysterious people about the markets and seems like he's the head honcho of everything. There were multiple opportunities to show just how ruthless he was, like this scene where his wife says that he \\"suffocates the family\\" with his imposing will. That was a perfect opportunity for him to exercise his power by punishing his wife somehow.<br /><br />They just kept setting things up but not really explaining anything.<br /><br />2. Stealing time is reaaaaaally easy. After a while, Will and Sylvia team up to steal time from the rich to give to the poor a la Robin Hood. Despite how valuable time is (people kill for a week in the ghetto), all of the time banks have really no security at all. Will and Sylvia get away super easily, even when stealing from Sylvia's father who employs many guards but has one number combination for his huge vault, containing 1 million years. Not even an eye or thumb scan? Weak.<br /><br />3. Will Salis is super badass. This guy who grew up in the ghetto, literally fighting for his life everyday, somehow is highly trained in driving, shooting, and being James Bond. I can understand that he's scrappy and resourceful, but they make him look like a freaking professional!<br /><br />4. I think one of the other reviewers mentioned this but the ghetto is really not that bad. They're just poor. The living conditions don't seem too awful other than people dying in the streets every day or so. But for such a horrible place, people are wearing decent clothing, the streets are clean, and no one seems desperate for time, despite living \\"day to day.\\" In fact, other than the mob boss who runs around cleaning people's time with his lackeys, people seem downright decent in the ghetto.<br /><br />Anyways, despite some of these shortcomings, it's worth a watch, if just to see what this movie could have been, had it been better written and executed. I actually liked it for the entertainment and for the fact that I could stick my arm out and ask my friend to pay me in time. :D

1466401885|4.0|So I finally finished the book and I guess I sort of agree with those who say Travis was a bit too far out there for me. Now I like a jealous  possessive \\"you belong to me\\"  hero but he was going over into wacko territory.<br /><br />I'm also not much into \\"lose\\" men. That's not a thrill to pull a guy whose given out his man parts like government cheese .<br /><br />How you gonna be with two women at the same time in the living room while the woman you want to be your  girlfriend sleeps in your bed.<br /><br />For a man who was so in love, how come Travis didn't \\"eat\\"?<br /><br />Abby and America were both annoying as hell. Abby was perhaps the most unlikeable heroine I've ever come across. Or maybe she was just more like a real person.<br /><br /> I  didn't like how Abby told Travis to teach Brazil a lesson aka a raw beat down. I also wasn't a fan of how Abby treated Parker. Way to use and abuse a guy turning him into a dog for some other woman to have to tame Abby.<br /><br />Is it me or did the teens in the this book drink a lot. I mean they really needed to set up a  AA meeting group on campus. Abby & Travis were a set of lushes if I ever seen one.<br /><br />With all that I  think I enjoyed the book more than disliked it. I'd give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Diary of Wimpy Kid books and the movies bring those classic characters to life!<br /><br />In this film, young Greg feels tortured by his older brother, Rodrick.  When their parents go out of town, Rodrick throws a party and Greg helps him hide the evidence.  When their parents find out, they both get in trouble and turn on one another.  Will they reconcile in the end or remain sworn enemies for life?<br /><br />Sure, these are oft-used plot points, but they are tried and true for a reason.  Call me sappy, but I love to see sibling rivalry shine through in the end.<br /><br />Maybe \\"only an idiot finds humor in bird poop,\\" but this idiot really enjoyed this fine family film.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|BEAUTIFUL DISASTER by Jamie McGuire.<br /><br />Why do so many of us love bad boys - the alpha male?  When reading this I thought about the typical hero in regency romances being the \\"rake,\\" the guy who drinks, gambles, and has lots of women.  Then he meets a woman and for her, he reforms.  We are told a reformed rake is the best kind of husband.  So I'm thinking who is the rake today?  It's Travis.  Shaved head, inked arms, bulging muscles.  He pays his college expenses by fighting tough guys in illegal campus fights.  He's undefeated.  College coeds throw themselves at him, follow him, hang on him, flirt, touch him.  He sleeps with many but only once and then insults them.  He tells them to go away and don't come back.<br /><br />When Travis sees Abby, it's fascination (or love) at first sight.  She doesn't want anything to do with him.  She tries to look ugly when she knows she will see him.  She finally agrees to be friends with him, not lovers.  His feelings and actions for her are soooo intense. Eventually they become lovers.  I liked the way this guy loved her.  I liked his intense feelings for her.  When she leaves him, he throws furniture and breaks things.  He's devastated and self destructive without her.  He reforms for her.  It's a good story watching Travis have a relationship for the first time in his life.<br /><br />I loved the sex scene at 7,959.  It was hot and passionate because of Travis' feelings for her.  She sees \\"the unconditional love in his eyes.\\"  There are 3 ½ short sex scenes in this book, but there is no sexual language, other than he is inside her.  I found these love/sex scenes hotter than an explicit BDSM book I recently read.  It's because of the emotion.<br /><br />Ok, so now the bad news.  My rational brain reminds me that this is the kind of guy who turns into the abusive wife beater.  This is rampant in our society - more than half the marriages turn abusive - or something like that.  So if you are going to be in the market for a husband some day, you should probably avoid this kind of guy.<br /><br />Also, I did not like two parts (below).  I was frustrated and unhappy during the last third of the book - which was too much.<br /><br />1.  Abby's father was a gambling loser for many years, frequently coming to Abby for help.  This time he came to her because he owed money to a mob guy.  She was stupid to agree to help him (again).  As a result she gets tangled in mob business.  I did not enjoy that part because she made a stupid decision.  If the author came up with another way for her to  tangle with the mob, it would have been better.  Just don't have her be stupid.  Then she was illogical.  When she was kicked out of the casino, she should have gone to another, but she didn't.  Then the father's part was unfinished.<br /><br />2.  Abby breaks up with Travis.  She loved him but she wouldn't go back to him.  At first her reasons were good, but later they were not, and I was unhappy.  At one point she thinks \\"If he asks me to come back one more time I will.\\"  But he didn't ask her at that moment, because he was doing something else she asked him to do.  So she continued the break up.  I wanted her to go back to him.  Instead of being interesting, that part frustrated me.<br /><br />If the author changed the last third, it could have been 4 ½ or 5 stars - for me.<br /><br />There was a feel-good happy ending.<br /><br />There were a handful of grammar errors mostly: I should be me, that should be who.<br /><br />SETTING AND CHARACTERS:<br />Abby is best friends with America.  They are students at a small university.  America is dating Shep who lives in an apartment with his cousin Travis.  Travis is a brilliant student and is able to help Abby study any subject.  Abby's back story is unusual, but I'll leave that for the reader to learn in the book.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Kindle count story length: 10,356 (679 KB).

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is one of the more entertaining movies that I have seen in some time. Thor's brother(a nasty individual) invades a stronghold. He manages to put a<br />key scientist and one of our heros Hawk under his spell with his staff. He escapes with his two prisoners destroying the complex. A source of energy comes<br />up missing as well. This prompts a crisis. Nick Fury is forced to gather up the members of SHIELD(Avengers) to handle this situation. One by one they come in. Captain America,Black Widow,Iron Man,Thor,and finally Hulk. This is the beginning of some feirce battles. The Avengers fight with Thor's brothers all over the country. They finally wind up in a tremendous war in New York. The Hulk does a major job in the end of the movie. No questions asked this is a<br />tremendous movie. There will have to be a sequel.

0439023513|2.0|Let me get right to the point. The ending of this trilogy was such a sad disappointment that I almost regretted reading any of the books. Hunger Games was good and Catching Fire was even better so there I was anxiously diving into Mockingjay expecting something extraordinary and it was so depressing and just a complete let down. The most disturbing thing was that throughout all three books, Katniss had endured so much, meant so much and survived all obstacles. Yet there she was at the end and I just felt no happiness from her. Why didn't she have a more pivotal role in the new government? Then, after all she endured with Gale and then at the end, he just seemingly dropped out of her life? I understand her ending up with Peeta although I would have preferred Gale but just for Gale to drop out her life with no real explanation. And Prim. That was so unnecessary to me. So cruel and so was Finnick. After all he had been through and finally finding some happiness and then such a pointless death. I just felt like both deaths were so pointless and were not necessary for an exciting finale. I actually felt so angered and disappointment to have read all three books only to come to this. Finally Haymitch. Also no real happiness for him either and didn't he deserve more? This book was just dark and depressing. I actually handed off all the books to my Dad and I waited anxiously to see what he would say after reading all three and I found that he felt exactly the same way. We both disliked the ending so much we are actually hoping that the screenplay will be dramatically changed. Something I never thought I'd say because the book is always better. Not in this case. I would not read Suzanne Collins again.

It's a challenging game, with great tutorials that teach without repeating everything over and over. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes logic games, and anyone looking for something unique and fun.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I liked it. Very good watch and the acting and script was well done. I recommend it to watch, keep in mind it's rated R.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|This movie started out well. As the movie progressed it got to to point I had to stop watching it. (My daughter continued to watch and I only listened) I could not stand seeing the abuse of so many horses. Though I know that no horses were actually harmed in the making of the movie it was hard to see horses killed and driven to the point of dropping to the ground totally worn out and then shot dead. On one hand it is a somewhat uplifting story but the animal abuse depicted out weighed that. I wish I had not watched it.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|After buying and listening to this album, my little sister remarked to me: \\"Jason Mraz has finally grown up!\\"<br />When I listened myself, I realized what she meant. I've always been a Jason fan, but now I like him not only as a songwriter but as a person. The party-animal mentality of \\"Waiting for My Rocket to Come\\", the emotional distance of \\"Mr. A-Z\\", and the somewhat egocentric sentimentality of \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" are nowhere to be found on \\"Love Is a Four-Letter Word\\". Mraz actually sings of love here--love between marriage mates, between parents and children, between individuals and the rest of humankind. And the way he describes it makes it seem like anything but a four-letter word.

0307594165|5.0|I've read six Toni Morrison novels and this is by far her most approachable and \\"easiest\\" read.  She has always been a master of prose, turning about some of the most eloquent sentences in the English language.  \\"Home\\" is no exception exemplified by one of my favorite sentences in the novel :\\"From the windows, through the fur of snow, the landscape became more melancholy when the sun successfully brightened the quiet trees, unable to speak without  their leaves\\".  At the same time, Morrison often challenges the reader with her less than straight-forward style.  I've often found myself reading pages several times to ensure I really understood both the substance and context of what is written.  In most cases, the effort is well worth it as the larger themes and beauty of the language makes the investment worthwhile.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" doesn't follow the usual Morrison conventions but doesn't suffer at all from the simpler and more direct storytelling.  The novel centers around Frank Money, African-American veteran of the Korean War (although Morrison doesn't directly note characters race, it is up to the discerning reader to decipher through context), returning home from the war after losing his two best friends in battle.  Frank suffers from what today would be diagnosed as PTSD, struggling to come to grips with the impact of war on his psyche, often resorting to alcohol to numb the effects.  Frank eventually makes his way to back to the small Georgia town he grew up in and never thought he'd return to help his sister Cee.<br /><br />Morrison covers a lot of ground and themes in a relatively spare set of pages -- a largely forgotten American conflict, the Jim Crow South right on the precipice of the Civil Rights movement, the lingering mental toll on veterans before conditions like PTSD were examined and even treated, unethical medicine like eugenics, conjuring memories of experiments conducted on African-Americans, just to name a few.  Tucked inside these broader societal themes are those of family and home, the impact of childhood memories and the deeper call of a need by a family member that brings those back together.<br /><br />I've felt that Toni Morrison wasn't on top of her extraordinarily high game the last several novels, but \\"Home\\" marks a return to the work of a master.  This is a novel that only someone as gifted and talented as Ms. Morrison could achieve and is worthy the highest of accolades.ietal themes are those of family and home, the impact of childhood memories and the deeper call of a need by a family member that brings those back together.<br /><br />I've felt that Toni Morrison wasn't on top of her extraordinarily high game the last several novels, but \\"Home\\" marks a return to the work of a master.

B00628RVV0|5.0|What a movie!  It was quite compelling and very well done.  I sat in silence for a good five minutes after it was over,  \\"shaken\\" by the story and reflecting tragedies of the Holocaust.<br />Told through the eyes of the children of a Nazi Commandant, this is a sad twist of fate for two young boys who befriend each other through the fence surrounding a concentration camp.  Keep the tissues close by!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love these puzzles and have them on my computer, kindle and several books. Was thrilled to get it as an app on my phone. Works well and includes challenging levels.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Only one thing kept this from a 5-star, and that was minor. At a couple of points, the action seemed too drawn out (i.e. Jules in her underwater journey). This is a common complaint I have, and it was really minimal in this book, but I did speed read a couple of pages at this point. This is one of the best sci-fi reads I have had in many, many years.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Most of the puzzles have the right amount of difficulty to keep this game challenging and enjoyable. And I found it for free, so what else can you ask? Great work!!
0062060562|4.0|For some reason when I thought this was going to be like the movie 50 First Dates. But it was a mix of that, Momento and The Jacket all rolled up into one really good book. I loved the way the summary about the book, Christine wakes up each day not knowing what happened the day before, is truly the premise but there is so much more to the story. While I did find the ending pretty predictable, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. Well written and I look forward to more from S.J. Watson.
B0086700CM|5.0|its about time amazon gets temple run! i love it. the clear image and just the fact that its here is all i think is important!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I read a couple reviews complaining about the plot and some other things.  I'd have to disagree on all of them.  One guy said he fell asleep, which I can't fathom because the explosions and gunfire ought to keep just about anybody awake even if they're not happy with the movie itself.  It's not really a slow-developing plot the way some people have said.  I just think those people were expecting explosions everywhere and tons of gunfights when the point of the movie isn't really the fighting but the life of Navy SEALs.<br /><br />As for the Chechen angle, I'm not sure why that part was chosen but I can say with confidence that the movie isn't promoting Russian propaganda.  More likely, it was one of those relatively safe things they could do.  Al-Qaeda or North Koreans would probably be more realistic (although I can't really say nobody in Chechnya would ever try to attack us, terrorism is relatively cheap and we haven't exactly helped them much), but do we really need to piss the Middle East and North Korea off more?  Muslim terrorists are already gunning for us and we can't really dismiss the possibility of having to fight North Korea.  Putting out a movie where we clean their clocks would seem kind of obnoxious regardless of how realistic it would be.  For those of you who said the Chechen angle isn't realistic, do you consider the Aliens movies, Star Wars, and all the Predator movies to be realistic?  Presumably not, but that doesn't mean they're not good (well, some of them weren't good but several of them were excellent).  Even with real SEALs, it's still a movie so not everything has to be plausible.  The main elements that were supposed to be real, the people, the mechanics, the weapons, etc. were all as real as I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />I saw one review that said This Means War is more worthwhile and is a better movie, which is total crap.  They're both very different movies so I can't really say that This Means War is worthless.  It is, however, the same kind of Hollywood production that's been around for years.  The plot is a little different but all the core elements have been done over and over.  Act of Valor is far more appealing to me specifically because it's not the type of thing that Hollywood does.<br /><br />I don't know how successful I've been at convincing anybody that Act of Valor is a good movie with the bad reviews out there.  It's important to know what you're getting though.  The description says what it's about and the intent of everybody involved going in has been discussed in public a lot.  It's the kind of movie that's meant to have realistic operations and depict what a Navy SEAL's life is like abroad and at home with their families.  If you're simply looking for action, this might not be a good choice for you.  There are several reasons that you may not like this movie, but if you're interested in the military I think you should buy Act of Valor.
0062011847|3.0|I love Terry Pratchett and I'm not kidding when I say that my collection of Discworld books look like they've been through a small regional war from multiple readings. I also know about, and am deeply saddened by, Terry's medical condition. But I have to be honest. Snuff is not representative of the Discworld books I've known and loved. Not even remotely. Neither was Unseen Academicals, and I do feel as though I should have stopped reading Pratchett's books then. It's just too depressing.<br /><br />The most discouraging part Snuff for me was main character, Sam Vimes. Arguably, Sam is my favorite character in the history of characters. Over the course of the series, we've seen him transform from an ultra-depressed alcoholic to a man of extreme importance and tremendous influence in Ankh-Morpork. But throughout that transition, Sam has been cynical and...well, a bit of a plodder. He's stubborn, street-smart, suspicious, paranoid-with-cause, ferocious in a fight, but he has never been a brilliant or quick thinker. He's no intellectual, which is one of his greatest charms. In fact, he has always been leery about \\"clues\\" and of people who jump to conclusion because of them.<br /><br />Except in Snuff. Sam has become the Ankh-Morpork version of Sherlock Holmes, knowing the answers almost before the questions are asked, and dredging into the minds and motivations of practically everyone with confidence and absolutely exhausting exposition. Uhm, that's not the Sam Vimes I remember. That's not the Sam Vimes I love. It's not him anymore.<br /><br />The other thing I've noticed, is that the voice of the novels just isn't there any more. It's not just a matter of the humor going missing. The entire voice is that of a different author. Whether that's because of Terry's condition, or because someone else is writing for him, or because there's a new editor in town, Snuff and Unseen Academicals are all but unrecognizable as Pratchett's work.<br /><br />Having said that, there is a plot there and it's not really a bad plot as far as they go. It's not a book I would choose to re-read, but I did finish it. So, I'm giving it three stars as the serviceable story it is. I just wish I could give it more, and I feel very guilty that I can't.a plot there and it's not really a bad plot as far as they go. It's not a book I would choose to re-read, but I did finish it.

B005JLNALG|1.0|I already reviewed the first Road Salt album, so I don't have much to say. I believe that everything up to the first Road Salt was great (even scarsick). This album is a dissapointment to a band that has created amazing things and is a let down.

B003INJETO|1.0|I've been a fan of Pain of Salvation for a few years and in my opinion everything up to this is great (even scarsick). If you're curious about this band absolutely DO NOT buy either of the road salt albums, but rather start out with either remedy lane or the perfect element part one as they are both conceptually and musically breathtaking. Recently Daniel (the frontman) has decided that music is becoming too overproduced and is convinced that the root of music lies somewhere in the midsts of 70's style classic rock. This album is the product of that idea and I wanted to enjoy this album as all the others, but I don't think this vibe works with POS. Every album before this has been inspiring from Entropia to Scarsick. Even if the albums were produced very well you could tell there was a lot of sweat, headaches, music writing, and philosophy(BE, wow..) Those things made the album, not the production, and this album just doesn't have those elements except for a few moments. I admire Daniel and his work and it may sound silly to dwell on the past productions, but I'm going to rate this album with one star because Pain of Salvation have incredible potential and have released three albums that really changed the way I see the world (TPE, Remedy Lane, and BE) and I still believe that they WILL make incredible albums this album is just discouraging though.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|ive had to uninstall and reinstall a couple of times......got to level 56 and quit getting quest.....is fun to play though
B0041EVYVK|2.0|I have to agree with others that have noticed that Daniel Lanlois has ruined most of this production. Why oh why is anyone but Trixie Whitley singing songs here?! It's unfathomable. I'm no genius but even I recognize she is the showcase. Just listen to \\"I Believe in You\\" and \\"Surely.\\" I'm sorry, but most of the rest is cringe-inducing dreck, \\"Last Time\\" and \\"Silverado\\" being the worst of the lot. Do yourself a favor and investigate Trixie's solo stuff. Trixie, you don't need this Lanlois guy. You're just fine on your own.
