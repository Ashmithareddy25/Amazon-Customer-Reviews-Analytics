B005L38QK2|5.0|exactly the right amount of buttons for Diablo 3, but if you're using a spell caster(witch doctor or mage) you still need the keyboard for force stop. beefy cord is a bonus. the red light makes it look awesome. no complaints at all, worth every penny.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers movie was a big risk. It was bringing together all the self-produced Marvel films so far - full of vastly differing worlds and characters - while the trailers were promising action of Michael Bay proportions. It easily could have wound up being a very stupid film. Fortunately, the film'd director/writer - the incomparable Joss Whedon - knew EXACTLY what he was doing. With his own signature wit and quirkiness, he brought the heroes together in a way that was hardly forced, allowing them to play off one-another naturally, while still delivering the thrills and spills expected of such a team-up. The film is allowed moments where it can loosen up and be funny while still being awesome, and when it gets dramatic, then in pure Whedon style, it gets dramatic. Some of the characters aren't as focused on as fans would like, but when it comes to Tony Stark's scene stealing quips or the best film version of the Hulk ever delivering the mother of all beatdowns on Loki, then the day isn't a total loss. THE AVENGERS is the best film of its kind since TERMINATOR 2 and is a must own for everyone, geek or otherwise.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Never thought I would be interested in this type of game, but tried it on a whim. I'm really glad I did! Very engaging and fun!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great fun very addictive. Nice to get hints when you're stuck. Like finding the ? and the mini puzzles. Best free app of the day so far!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is really fun you should try it. The only problem is that it is too easy and could use some harder settings.
B0086700CM|1.0|it shut down my whole kindle for 2 days. I am so mad because it has done this twice now.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is a romantic drama. The usual boy loves girl and all the troubles that come with that. The main character has come back from the war and this leads to unsual problems. This is a good read.
0547569653|5.0|This book was awesome!  Scott's amazing athleticism powered only by a vegan diet is inspirational and thought provoking.  I first heard about Scott through Chris McDougal's book, Born to Run.  Born to Run made Scott out to be an angel and the only thing he was missing were a halo and wings.  I loved this book because we got a better sense that Scott is not perfect, made him seem more human, but certainly more determined than most of us.  And his relationship with Dusty \\"Dustball\\" Olsen (?) was interesting because Dusty is such a hell-raiser and seemed rather like Scott's alter-ego.<br /><br />The story of his childhood and his relationships with his folks was fascinating as well.  His close relationship with his ill mother was very very touching.  His love for his mother was very apparent throughout the book.<br /><br />The approach that he takes to diet was also one of the most satisfying parts of the book.  The information that it contained especially when he wrote of his injuries and how he believes that his diet was instrumental in healing his body quickly and efficiently was for me the best part of the book.  Since reading Born to Run I have tried to limit my meat intake, especially red meat.  That along with the documentaries Forks over Knives and Fat Sick and Nearly Dead has me convinced that our Western Diet is what is making us obese and sick.<br /><br />Thank you Scott for a great read!
0765316994|5.0|Sorry to give it away, but, basically, the dispensable characters in an author's mind turn on him.  A mix of hilarity and seriousness results.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I'll say no more because I don't want to give any more away.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Rush just keeps bringing it! Their energy, musicianship, and writing just gets better and better.  This wonderful concept album shows how good these 3 rock & roll legends are, but the recording and mix by Nick Raskulinecz is way too heavy handed. It's of the \\"LOUD AS POSSIBLE\\" and then COMPRESS THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF IT\\" to control any clipping/distortion/digital artifacts method of recording, and I think it ruined this fine effort by Rush. Perhaps the studio set-up that Raskulinecz has flatters this sound, but my audiophile system does not!  Too bass heavy and squashed, no dynamics, drums and guitar washed out, and lack of definition. I wonder if the members of Rush were able to listen to this on anything outside of the studio. I sure hope Rush will consider a re-mix and re-issue on this masterpiece, and dump Raskulinecz on their next recording!<br /><br />Since my original post, I received a comment about my playback gear perhaps being sub-par. Much of my review of this CD is based on my listening via two high quality headphone amps, one a tube unit and the other transistor based. Headphones used were Denon AH-D7000's and Sennheiser HD-600, both top end and excellent quality headphones.<br /><br />I stand by my thoughts on the sound quality. It is a muddy, bass heavy recording.  But the tunes themselves are as most here have stated, some of Rush's best and quite amazing! I still would recommend it to Rush fans.
B00846REIS|5.0|easy to read but the character gideon is a bit weird will continue the series to find out more about his issues!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Usually, when I see a Kindle book for a bargain price, I worry about the quality of the writing.  Not so with Wool.  The author priced Wool ridiculously low with the hope that the price point would encourage folks to try his writing. And let me tell you, his writing is excellent!<br /><br />I'll do my best to write a spoiler free review, as I greatly enjoyed reading this book with no preconceived ideas.<br /><br />Wool is a dystopian science fiction tale told in the first person narrative.  The story and mystery begins to unfold as we begin with the perspective of a character recently sentenced to death.  The tale unfolds through flashback and through shifting viewpoints from character to character.  The mythology of this universe slowly unfolds as we learn more about each character.  The book deals with issues of civilization, rules, and survival - delving into ethical questions such as what lengths should a civilization or a civilizations' leaders take to keep the populace alive?  Who decides which of these rules are best and how they should be enforced? Knowledge is power and truths are hidden from all except those at the very top.<br /><br />The title of the book seems to refer to a specific act that must be carried out by those who have been condemned to death.  Early on in the book, knitting is used as a metaphor for much that is happening with this society (although it is cotton yarn, rather than wool).  Fabric is created through the knots of the yarn, but is so easily destroyed by one snip.  That metaphor ties in to the ethical dilemmas raised in this story line (Is it possible for one idea or one question to \\"unravel\\" the entire civilization?)<br /><br />Concepts in this book are similar to ideas raised in The Hunger Games and 1984.  The writing is exceptional - no grammatical errors (no typos in the Kindle edition either), sentences are creative and flow, and each character's voice is distinctly their own.<br /><br />This book is a gem, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in science fiction, post apocalyptic ethics, or anyone looking for an interesting book to read.
B00095NX9G|5.0|An absolutely fantastic pair of DVDs that holds your hand throughout your entire learning experience. Rachel does an excellent job, I was and still am truly impressed by how thorough her lessons are.<br /><br />Only a few things I would like to note:<br /><br />Prior dance experience, especially ballet, is very helpful. I realized while learning the various dance moves that if I had not had several years of ballet under my belt, I would have had a good deal of trouble learning the moves and putting them all together without getting all tied up and frustrated. It is important to remain relaxed, shoulders down, hips loose, and comfortably graceful.<br /><br />Also, Rachel occasionally gets her rights and lefts mixed up, or her \\"inhale\\" and \\"exhale\\" commands backwards. Not a big deal, but at the times I've found this to be confusing, I've just followed her example rather than listen to what she says.<br /><br />And lastly, when the yoga starts to get easy after consistent practice, it is good to modify the various yoga poses that she teaches. However, she doesn't tell her viewers exactly how to modify them, so I had to experiment a little on my own, being careful not to hurt myself. Again, not a big deal, more nitpicky than anything else.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful, wonderful experience. I absolutely love Rachel, and hope to see her one day in person!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I agree that this game is fantastic but unfortunately if you try to update it you cannot send your drawing or do most anything because the ads are in the way:((
B000PAU032|5.0|This was a gift. I asked him what he thought of it and he loves it. He plays in a band and loves his music so if he says it is good it has to be good!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Found it very interesting though a little technical and repetitive. I actually liked it more than I thought I would.
0345803485|1.0|I am a third of the way through this book and will not be finishing it. This is the worst book I've ever read. The writing is so poor and uses the same phrases over and over to the point where I am rolling my eyes. The characters are not believable in any way. Last of all, why would I want to read about a woman who thinks so little of herself that she would willingly allow a man to abuse her? Is that what I would want for my daughters when they grow up? I do not understand the popularity of this book at all.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is so fun!  u can write speech and add stickers and do basicly anything u want.  its so fun!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I thought the movie was great. Being an african-american man i feel we need more movies about our history. If more movies like this was shown to all people regardless of color maybe there wouldn't be so much racism today. And for those that didn't appreciate the movie probably never got over slavery ending. It  was a GREAT MOVIE AND STOP THE HATE !!!!!!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I am totally obsessed with this series.  Season One was great and Season two is even better.  The acting and the writing are Superb.. I can't wait for Season 3!!!
B0081J95TE|5.0|I didn't even realize that they had put out a new album at first. I was watching some live performances from them a couple weeks ago and decided to see if there was news of any new music coming out and lo and behold they had just released this! I think it may be my favorite album from them yet! Its very heavy and very richly layered. I really dig it a lot and think I'll pick up on different things I may have missed before on different listenings. Also I don't think there were any tracks on here that I'd call throw away tracks either... And most albums even from the best have one or two of thsoe. Great album and I highly recommend picking it up!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|After book one, I was totally addicted to the series and for sure I enjoyed this one even more. There are so many things happening in the same time yet never confusing. 2nd book continues great story, brings us great battles but also drives us into the mind of the, once oppressed, ska population and their leaders.<br />Those who enjoyed the first book, will have hard time putting this book down once they start reading.
B0086700CM|3.0|okay so i was so excited when this came out and yah its pretty fun and addicting but after awhile every game i played started lagging and u cant really play at all after awhile...too bad.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I have been wanting to play paranormal agency since I got my kindle. its all I expected and more. I just absolute love this game thanks for putting it up as free app of the day
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|Does exactly what it says it does. Great colour, great product. My daughter is very happy with it. Thank you
B0086700CM|4.0|fun simple and to the point. not complex and rather mind numbing after a long and weary day.<br />recommended for a nice break from life.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read the first book in this series in just a couple days. It was interesting and entertaining. I had a bit more trouble getting though this book. While I still enjoyed it, it was too repetitive and in some spots, a little boring. I didn't look forward to reading it and finding out what was going to happen to Christin and Ana like I did in the first book. I don't think I can add much else then what all the other reviews for these books say because if you like the first book, you'll continue reading the series and if you didn't like the first book, I definitely wouldn't continue to book two and book three.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|Review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />I absolutely love Liam Neeson, he's probably one of my favorite actors. Now, while this movie was advertised as an intense action film, it's not. If you're expecting action and love action flicks, then don't even bother watching this. It's more of a psychological drama with a few witty lines/moments thrown in. This isn't a movie for everybody. It's depressing and doesn't necessarily have a \\"Hollywood ending\\".<br /><br />This movie is about hope and losing it. It's about seeing a glimpse of that hope and then accidentally going in the wrong direction. It's about having the will to fight and giving up. It's frustration and fear. These are things that people don't want to see or feel. But then keep in mind it's a movie, not a documentary.<br /><br />Honestly, I originally didn't wanna see the movie because I thought it was going to be a cheesy action movie. I love action flicks as much as the next person, but action movies eventually lose it's substance. Drawn out and boring. This movie was nowhere near that. It lacked action sequences (which everybody loves apparently), but had what I look for in a movie. Something dark. Definitely best ending I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />For everyone saying, they shoulda done this or shoulda done that...you wouldn't know what to do because you'd be too shocked to think straight and you've probably never been in that kind of situation. Too much foul language and gore? Ummm, clearly it's marked rated R, what are you expecting? Unrealistic animal behavior? Yeah, because you know every single wolf out there and they clearly all act the same. We're animals and we've heard of the most unbelievable stories of humans behaving odd, so I'm sure there are odd animals out there that behave strangely and out of the norm. Nevermind that, how many movies have we seen, where animals behave \\"unrealistically\\" and no one really whined about it? (Jaws, Cujo, etc.). Call me strange, I'm a guinea pig enthusiast, but you don't see me whining about G-Force and how they had a cg guinea pig using a running wheel even though in real life, they aren't supposed to.
B0086700CM|5.0|I reccommend it... love it so much it is really fun. my granddaughter introduced it to me and now I love it. I love it but I do suck at it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game totally rocks! i love the variety of games and the points thing. i totally recomand it. and the continuing ads dont even bother me! i highly suggest you get this game
0385360185|4.0|I really enjoyed reading book one, had a bit more trouble Getting through book two but thought book three was right in the middle. It still had the repeative phrases that drove me nuts but, besides that, I enjoyed the story and was curious to see how it all ended. I don't feel as though we have seen the end of Christin and Ana and I hope when they do return, they have grown up and bit and learned some new things to say ('oh my Fifty' has got to go!)! The whole story was entertaining and that's what I like in a book. I have no regrets for purchasing and reading the trilogy. And when the movie comes out, I'll probably see it too.
B007Z9QS5K|2.0|Doing a multi-part story is difficult - and New Year's Eve is an example of how not to do it.  Stories are confusing and boring.

0345803507|4.0|Provactive and racy content but entertaining. Easy reading that keeps you locked in wanting to see what happens next. Not your typical romance novel.
B007MDB71O|4.0|The irony of the poor box office and critical reception of this nevertheless entertaining film is that, while it may have been indifferently marketed by Disney (like THE ROCKETEER, another favorite of mine)it was also released far too many years after any (non-geriatric) fan base remained to support it due to the fact that, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS before it, the technology simply did not exist until recently with the advent of CGI to make it believably plausible in execution (even the great Ray Harryhausen would have been hard-pressed to do a convincing stop-action animation version with so many of the principal characters being non-human).  As an unfortunate result so much time has passed by now that, with the exception of Tarzan, most of Burroughs' great creations have largely faded from popular memory, and after a procession of so many Star Wars, Avatars and Prometheuses (Prometheii?) JOHN CARTER is now is inevitably perceived as imitative rather than innovative, which is a grave disservice to a terrific series of books and a pretty good film....
B0086700CM|5.0|You can be quite amused for countless hours on this game and waste lots of time and won't even know it!
B006WAIV6M|3.0|An interesting book, enough to cause me to stop and consider my own unconscious habits. Good examples are given. Does a fair job in suggesting that our habits, once we become aware of them, are our responsibility . Very short and less useful appendix (from the view of a health professional) on the way to address change
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|Not sure why this movie will be disappearing from my library in October 2012.  Usually when you buy a movie it is yours forever :(
B006N9KFPC|5.0|What a great CD from Adam Lambert!  It contains something for everybody and every mood - happy, sexy, moody, and fun! What a wonderful effort from this artist on his sophomore CD.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This did not disapoint. The ending is a shocking one, but with a trilogy it was a refreshing change of pace to the way books are written now. Katniss is an extraordinary character that is carried with her emotions until the very end. This is a great read and will do it again soon. Especially when the movies start hitting theatres.
0307716546|5.0|Grace Covey is at her children's school the day it catches on fire; her young son safe, she races into the building to help find and save her 17 year old daughter, Jenny.  Tragically, both mother and daughter are seriously injured, and, in a twilight state--are able to communicate with each other while the world goes on around them, their lives in the balance.<br /><br />It's an amazing setting for a story of love and courage, part mystery as the arsonist is uncovered, part remembrance of their lives past, part urgency and crisis as their family hopes for the best and prepares for the worst.<br /><br />A tale of courage and the tragic things that can happen to a family in the space of a few minutes, a suggestion that life is more than the world around us, a beautifully poignant story by a gifted author.  Run, don't walk to the bookstore......
B004U52VPS|1.0|I have a seven year old and a four year old.  My seven year is old is super patient and rule abiding and she was absolutely over learning this game immediately because it takes a very long time to set up the \\"screens\\".  Thus, the rules were instantly irrelevant.  The slingshot does not project the birds very far or fast.  You need a flat surface to even get a chance to stack the beams and then you need thin fingers and a steady hand, two things I do not possess.  By the end of day two the birds were in the bath and the \\"wooden\\" beams scattered to the winds.  My four year old just plays with the rubber birds.  Great in concept, but not in practice.
B00846REIS|4.0|Ok, i read this book in 2 days and although i couldnt put it down, it was a little too reminisent of Fifty Shades of Grey!  I kept wondering if the author read that before writing this!  I like the characters of Eva and Gideon, but i could only picture Ana and Christian Grey!!  Fifty Shades was just soooo good to me that i can not seem to find anything to read that compares to or is better than it!!!  I do look forward to book 2 of the Crossfire series, but i just hope it becomes more of its own book and not a knock off of Fifty Shades of Grey!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is about a boy and girl, they meet marry and then the girl goes missing. The story of hope, mystery, and suspense. It is a suspenseful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Who did it?

B0015DROBO|5.0|The book leads you through the life of a troubled intelligent young woman. It is also a murder mystery that wraps itself around the main character. The novel is a good read and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and the plot unravels.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is so entertaining and I love it. People try to copy it in a way but no one can impress me better than this app.
0345803485|5.0|Once you start reading you can't stop. Great series. The author keeps you interested and what an imagination and way with words.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book kept your interest the entire way through.  I normally don't like these types of books, but I read it based on a recommendation from a friend and really enjoyed it.  I'm no prude, but I did get a little tired of the sexual encounters which seemed to be on every other page and went into very explicit detail.  I got to the point where I just paged through them as they seemed quite redundant after a  while.  Other than that, the book was well written and definitely worth reading.
0345803485|3.0|Sure it was hot, but sometimes I just wanted to shake her for being so stupid.  There was also one disgusting scene I couldn't get past.  Not quite worth all the hype.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Loved the album! Excellent as most things that come from Mr. Mayer are.Was very pleased with the product and the speed it got to me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app gave me several hours of entertainment. I enjoyed the fact that you play games to unlock others. the thing I didn't like was the hyperspace game is overly difficult for being one of the first unlocked games
B004J4WLPU|3.0|Very few stories told partially by letter exchange excite me. It's the telling, not showing that bores me quickly. The \\"reveal\\" in the plot was not believable. I skipped a lot otherwise I wouldn't have finished the book. I would recommend for those who like tear-jerkers and drawn out scenes. Prepare to linger.
0446573019|5.0|I got this book on a vacation day when I was supposed to do a slew of errands, one of the most impressvie elements of this book is Baldacci's character dialogue.<br />So i guess I will look forward to anthoer \\"Jack Reacher to the rescue\\" and keep an eye on the best-seller list for another Puller!
0061906220|5.0|I got this book for my granddaughter because her dad's name is Pete.  My 22 month old granddaughter now can read the book to us.  We love the book !  The message in the book is applicable to everyone.  I will be buying more Pete the Cat books.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It is an ok app. Seems a bit wonky sometimes - pieces don't always respond appropriately, puzzle select ticked me off at first.  It's not a bad app, just not my favorite.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|A game that makes you think and use your eye and brain. Very good on stay at home days. A very good way to pass the time.
B002VLU52Y|1.0|I got this book for school so I would be able to read it at home for a 7 page essay for the class. When I recieved this book about 15 pages had been cut out. Not the whole pages just the text, so I was left with 15 outlines of pages. Worst purchase ever made on amazon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this on my Kindle late last night and finished it just now, this afternoon.  It is not a short story--I just was hooked.  Couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I've read in the reviews complaints about the ending, but I thought it was quite fitting.  I won't say more though... too many reviewers spoil the fun of discovering the book the way it was meant to--by reading it.<br /><br />I've read close to 200 Kindle books in the past few months, very few were notable enough to even bother reviewing.  So I usually don't.  But this is one book I'll definitely recommend.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is hot!  When a friend told me about some of the details of the book I was totally turned off.  But after downloading a sample of the book I became addicted.  I've just finished the entire Trilogy and I couldn't put it down.  To anyone making the decision to take on the \\"Shades of Grey\\" if you read it with an open mind and throw your inhibitions to the wind you'll definitely enjoy it.  Loved it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|most games you cant keep playing like smurfs village they want you to wait a crazy amout of time until you can play again. and you give us a lot of coins.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My friend and I laughed out loud.  It's been a long time since that happened.  We were all teary eyed at the end. The audience was FULL of children, and except for one very young child that got scared at one point and cried they were all spellbound the entire time.  More than 100 kids, sitting quietly in silence.  With only one misfire (in my opinion) Pixar understands it's the STORY, not not technology, that makes for an amazing movie.
0345803493|1.0|I SUFFERED through the first book.  And it wasn't even the supposed bad writing that made the 2nd book in the trilogy such a HORRIBLE endeavor. It's the underlying theme...\\"I can love his demons away\\".  I am absolutely in the minority, but I don't believe Christian Grey is ANY kind of Knight in Shining Armor at all.  He's a controlling stalker.  He's a creepy sadist.  He's a predator.  And before you Grey-dites start screaming about how you have to 'understand' their relationship and Ana consents to everything that happens to her.  She doesn't.  Every chapter in the book is all about how she doesn't want to do 'whatever', but then caves because she's afraid she will lose him.  I know it's fiction, I know it's based on Twilight (don't get me started on that piece of trash), but come on ladies, show a little self respect!  The sex may be hot, but there are thousands of \\"bodice ripper\\" romance novels out there that can accomplish the same result without being so demeaning.<br /><br />Write a book about S&M with two COMPLETELY consenting adults!  It can be hot and empowering.  Paring a literal virgin with a sexual sadist is just pandering and wrong.  For me, book three is a hard limit.

B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this trilogy. It kept me entertained and looking for me. At the end i wanted more specially with the expert of the book that I hope she is currently working on, The Fifty Shades Trilogy from Christian Grey's point of view!! Can't wait for that one to come out. I Recommend this book. The fact that is all 3 in 1 it made it easier for me to reference check and to move to the next book instantly.
0307951529|5.0|One of the least considered business models, but one that is truly enjoyable is the one person business. Done right it can give you the freedom to live your dream life while making money at the same time. This will give you the freedom to pursue your passions both in business and out of business. Otherwise, you end up with something that is nothing more than a job.<br /><br />However, this book goes far beyond just the one person business. This is about finding the right business for you. As Chris says in the book, this is definitely not about how to have the next big internet startup. This is about creating the right business for you that allows you the freedom to pursue your dreams while making money too. It can be that one person business, like mine, that I talked about, or it can be a bigger more ambitious business. Regardless of which one you choose though, Chris will help you get into the right business for you.<br /><br />This book is far more than just thinking outside the box. This book will put you on a journey of discovery, not just to find your dream business/life, but discovering how to meld your life purpose into what you want to do in your business.

0345803485|1.0|No really: the word 'crap' appears 90 times.<br /><br />\\"I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror.\\" Thus begins one of the worst novels I have ever had the displeasure to read. I decided to read this book as an experiment, a study in contemporary popular \\"fad literature\\". I am aware that it started out as Twilight fan fiction, and it's extremely obvious. It's like a train wreck, and I had to see it through.<br /><br />The lead female is literally an idiot -- graduating college in 2011 and doesn't have an e-mail address or computer of her own...how? (That's just one example.) And the the male, well he is an absolute douchebag ('arrogant' and 'stalker' are both used to describe him). The inner monologue of Ana is frustratingly dull and I found myself skimming a lot, especially toward the end. The most exasperating thing about Ana's POV is the characterization of her 'subconscious' and 'inner goddess', with phrases like \\"my subconscious sneers at me,\\" and, \\"my very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba.\\" (I. WHAT??) The author's use of subconscious does not mean what she thinks it means. Her eye-rolling and lip-biting is pretty ridiculous, too, as is her clumsiness (it's really not cute at all).<br /><br />Whoever is responsible for editing this book should be ashamed. There are so many overused words and phrases. For example, the word 'murmur' occurs 197 times -- averaging about twice a page. That one was by far the most irritating. Perhaps the author could have benefited from that list of over 300 ways to say 'said'. She uses the phrase, \\"he cocked his head to one side,\\" so much that I started picturing a velociraptor (which is actually an improvment).<br /><br />The author never goes beyond using 'erection' to refer to the male anatomy -- is Christian perpetually hard? If so, perhaps he should see a doctor; as they say on those 'male enhancement' commercials, an erection lasting more than four hours is something to be concerned about. Vaginais mentioned twice, and any other time it's just 'there' or 'my sex'. Quite frankly, I'm surprised 'clitoris' appears ten times, since Ana is not only a virgin, but has never masturbated either.<br /><br />The characters use condoms until Ana goes on the pill, which is fine, however there are a couple of problems. Firstly, there are times where Christian is described as exploding inside her whilst wearing a condom. Um...did the author forget? Secondly, as soon as Ana starts her period and we get that totally gross period sex scene, they stop using condoms. Not only has she not been on the pill for a full month yet, but you can still get pregnant while on your period.<br /><br />While I'm certainly not an expert in BDSM practices, even I can easily tell that the scene is severely misrepresented in this tome.<br /><br />This novel is basically a guide for what not to do when writing, ever. I had to take frequent breaks to read things that didn't irritate me. I finished the book wondering how in the hell there's going to be a movie adaptation that isn't X-rated, especially as everyone in the book murmurs, whispers, mutters, and mumbles, which would make it very hard to understand.<br /><br />In short: skip it.
1416550550|5.0|i absolutely LOVED this book! i think i only gave her previous book 3 stars but this one was 5 all the way! it was just filled with layer upon layer of secrets and intrigue and mystery with a little romance sprinkled throughout for good measure. i loved all of the different voices throughout the different timelines too. i never wanted to put this book down! every time a bit of a secret was uncovered another mystery was underneath. every chapter, every page unearthed and unraveled more and more but in such a perfect way and pace. and you just fell in love with all of the different characters and their own plights and desires, each in their own time, and the way each character was linked to the others with fun surprises mixed in there too. it was such a bonus to have so many memorable characters and each of their own stories was unforgettable.  i won't spoil anything by giving away actual details, just that the entire book overall was wonderfully and completely magical! a high recommend on this one and i eagerly await reading more by this author, hoping they are as much a treasure as the forgotten garden.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|So every Star Trek fan know that when a red shirt goes on an away mission he or she is going to die. What happens when the crew figures out this happens way too much? What if there was a way to fix it? John Scalzi takes a poke at some the unnecessary deaths that happen during sci-fi tv shows and makes you ask why does it have to be this way. Some times funny but always a good read, Red Shirts is a great novel. Scalzi's humor is a little strange at times but if you enjoyed his other books Red Shirts will be great read.
B003O85W3A|3.0|I've finally listened to the entire album after putting it off for two years and have to say that I'm extremely disappointed.<br /><br />For some reason, this release is missing something. The tracks are lifeless and not in an enjoyable way.<br /><br />It isn't fair to compare their later releases to the near perfect Funeral, but this is far below sub-par. Their musical style and production has matured, but the joy I always hear in their songs is gone. Yes, I said joy even though their lyrics are usually depressing. Speaking of lyrics, they were repetitive almost to the point where I wanted to skip tracks less than 1 minute in. This has only happened for me with In the Backseat, the last track from Funeral.<br /><br />Suburbs, Rococo and Sprawl II have a bit of pep in them. I love The Suburbs (continued). It's a nice way to end a (mostly) lifeless album.<br /><br />Honestly, this may be an album I have to listen to after a few months of the initial hearing. I'll give it 3 stars because of that.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I only recorded and watched this movie because it was up for some awards. What a surprise. I enjoyed it very much!  It was sweet, funny and kept my interest, which is hard to do. The music, story line with historical characters was well done. The acting was very good and the ending was wonderful.....I love happy, feel good endings.  So many of the movies I have watched lately end with the main characters dying or being left with a feeling of......is that all there is!
0345803485|3.0|I was more fascinated by the relationship dynamics than the sex. The sex became repetitive and excessive. The writing itself wasn't exceptional. I consider myself a fairly bright and articulate person, however the author would throw in random words I had never seen, and have no context in high to figure out their meaning. Over all, it was okay, but definitely did not live up to te hype.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|out of all the features I have enjoyed turning funny/awkward photos into comedy gold. not much into photo editing but I suppose it has the tools needed to create decent prints. have had issues opening images in landscape mode but as long as I open it in portrait in functions flawlessly.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I purchased all three books in the Fifty Shades of Grey series for reading on my Kindle Fire.  I bought one book at a time to figure out how long I would be interested in the set.  Although the bondage and sadism scenes were graphic, you could sense that the characters would fall in love before it was all over.  Sure enough, the series turned into a (almost)standard romance story by the third book, when it became a Perils of Pauline kind of story with the hero rescuing the heroine from the evil villain.  The books were not written well, would not receive any kind of literary award, and the author repeated certain phrases and concepts over and over very annoyingly.  Probably the whole story could have been told in one or two books rather than three.  And although numerous librarians have called the series pornagaphic and refused to stock the books in their libraries, there are huge numbers of readers on the waiting list for those copies that are available.  I would recommend that would-be readers order copies on their e-readers and not wait for paper copies to be available.  It is inexpensive and quick to order copies from Amazon.
B005VPRG10|4.0|My son loves the Star Wars Lego line-- We build them together (though he could do it alone, I'm sure... but he's impatient when he gets them, and this goes quicker!)and then he runs around the house with them and has battles.<br /><br />His other Lego fighters are pretty sturdy-- You can play with them and crash them and pop pieces off to pretend they're damaged without having too much work figuring out how to replace them-- But I think this TIE Fighter is a little different then, say, the X-wing.  The x-wing is a sturdy beast!  Even with my son's own modifications (he likes to have a gunner pointing back, since that is where the enemy fire always succeeded in the first movie), we really haven't had too much difficulty with it. That can't be said so emphatically about the TIE Fighter, though it's still a really cool set!<br /><br />I know someone else commented on another's review that if you want to play with them, you should buy the non-lego play sets for Star Wars-- but the beauty, to me, is that with lego-- you CAN pretend to battle them and have \\"real\\" damage.  You can also modify them to be better fighters, as my son did with the x-wing.  Legos are, after all, toys-- not models.<br /><br />So... with that in mind-- The TIE Fighter is certainly a more fragile lego toy then the other Star War ships.  The side \\"wings\\" (or whatever they are) are big and are made of smaller pieces, kept flat, so of course they aren't the most durable structures.  I plan to try to get some larger black flat pieces to sort of reinforce the seams a bit.  Though this will be less flat, I think it will hold up better.  They also attach to the actual \\"ship\\" (the little ball in the middle)in kind of a fragile way... and I really don't know how they could've done that better-- But it hasn't been too much of an issue.  The only thing is-- when something does \\"pop\\" in that area, a major reconstruction is necessary to replace things.  (But this is also partly because my son tries to do it himself without consulting the building guide again...)<br /><br />OVERALL-- it is a pretty faithful reproduction of the ship from the movies, and is very cool-- But if you are getting this for a younger kid that will actually want to battle with it, be sure he knows that it's a more-fragile construction then the other models.  My son went into this knowing that (we read reviews before we ordered) and while it's caused a bit of frustration, I still think he is very happy with it and does not regret ordering it!  (BTW-- my son is 8)<br /><br />When I ordered this, it was $5 cheaper then at the lego site.  Even so, I still can't give a lego star wars kit 5 stars but that is ONLY BECAUSE OF PRICE.  I know a lot of design must go into these things and I don't want to undervalue that aspect-- but in reality, we are talking plastic bricks.  When ANY lego set costs 300 bucks (the death star) and it's really just a bunch of plastic bricks, I can't help but think it just may be over priced....self without consulting the building guide again...)<br /><br />OVERALL-- it is a pretty faithful reproduction of the ship from the movies, and is very cool-- But if you are getting this for a younger kid that will actually want to battle with it, be sure he knows that it's a more-fragile construction then the other models.

This stuff can work if the chick hasnt heard of it before and is really easy to pull off.  If se does recognize it though you will most likely get slapped.  All around it is a great and funny book though.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a awesome fun game for all ages. You can build your own town just the way you like it. With different missions.
0099579936|1.0|Most of the time I don't read stuff I don't like and if I find myself disinterested while reading, I simply stop... This \\"book\\" was given to me by a friend and obviously I wanted to see what ALL the hype was about. I'm no literary critic, but I love to read but this was plain torture. Never in my life did I put a book down for two weeks straight simply because I was that uninterested and annoyed w/myself for reading such garbage. What shocks me even more is how many people enjoyed this book and rave about it. This makes me wonder: \\"Who is the target audience here?\\" I mean lets be serious, \\"down there\\", \\"he emptied himself into me\\", \\"my inner goddess\\", my \\"unconscious subconscious\\" - I rolled my eyes and laughed out loud like I was at a comedy club... This book is an embarrassment.  Uncharismatic characters, who annoy the reader, no real plot, bizarre interactions, boring sex, and a flat story line which doesn't grab your attention past Chapter 4. Forget reading the trilogy!!! Oh, Part II is really good?!? Are you serious?? For starters I'd need to have an ounce of interest in finishing Part I, but when my left shoe has more personality than all the characters in this \\"masterpiece\\" need I say more? Save your time, money and good mood! :) Anyone w/a healthy sex life, has more fun on a Tuesday night than these two had in a month. Harlequin books would be considered literary works of art compare to this. 50 shades of lame!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|the game is fine and ok but it requires 78 MB??? that's too much for a game like this....I knew it was gonna be a lot of space but..78 MB??? No way...I'm uninstalling this for more space to get new apps
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Starting slow and quiet with the enigmatic \\"Some Nights (Intro),\\" this isn't an album that hits you upside the head with its awesomeness. But don't worry, because it gets busy impressing with the anthemic \\"Some Nights.\\" Beautiful harmonizing vocals kicks off this ode to the questing, questioning youth, which brings in a thumping drum beat to drive the song home. Following this song is the runaway hit \\"We Are Young\\" a song that for me is overplayed to tears, but I can still listen to it because it really is an excellent song.<br /><br />I won't go through each song, but personal stand-outs for me are Why Am I the One, All Alone, and Stars.<br /><br />Nate Ruess builds themes throughout the songs, calling back to other songs in the record and even the previous Fun. record (Aim and Ignite, also pretty damn amazing). Musically dense with plenty of soaring chords & melodies, the Fun. record rewards multiple listens to tease out its intricacies. No song is a flop.<br /><br />If you like (or liked, before you heard it a thousand times) We Are Young, you will find much on this record to satisfy your taste for pop-conscious uniquely-constructed rock anthems. Fun. doesn't sound like everyone else on the radio, and I am oh so happy about that.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Sherlock Holmes; A Game of Shadows was terrible and completely unbelievable. It was too much like watching a cartoon or worse a video game. There is entirely too much going on and seems like it was made for individuals who have a short attention span. I dread to think what the third installment will be like.

I rated 5 out of 5 stars, because I literally would not change one thing about them.  Lake is independent, smart and perfectly flawed as is Will.  The stories are beautifully written and very real. I plan to read again. :-)
B005FITIK0|1.0|I just never found anything redeeming about this movie.  There was no purpose in it, it went nowhere and did nothing.  I can't even say the \\"acting was good\\"<br />because I didn't get what there was to act in the first place.  A waste of time.
0345803507|1.0|Racey Book in my opinion! Personally I don't understand all the hype. I would have liked less \\"bedroom time\\" and more of an actual story...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book!!!! This book allows you to explore the fantasies that are deep in the back of your mind. It allows you to live the life of someone that society shuns. Fifty Shades of Grey made me want to better myself. It has giving me the push I have been needing to get out and excersise and eat healthy in hopes of catching my own Mr. Grey. So far I have lost 30 pounds. The thing I love the most about these books is the high hopes that it has giving me that there might still be good men in thos world, men that will love you unconditionally, fight for you, and want to be with you beacuase they love you more than life itself. These books have brought me hope and have given me something to live for and I thank E.L. James everyday for it. Please read these books they will forever change your life.

1444737090|5.0|The story of James Bowen and \\"Bob\\" the street cat is one of the most heartwarming books I have read in a long time.  Tis true, I am a 'cat' person, and in Bob I saw the beloved ginger cat I was lucky to have had in my life years ago.  That aside, the book begins with James drifting through his life, dealing with his personal struggles, and then suddenly crossing paths with 'Bob'.  James decides to serve a purpose larger than himself by caring for this street cat, and the story unfolds from there.  Through their  mutual skills, street smarts and guile, James and Bob are there for each other during times of strife, never giving up, and coming to know what is really important......the small things in life that represent peace and happiness.  This book is a great 'feel good' story guaranteed to make you smile.  But even more - it might serve as a source of encouragement.  I give a major hat tip to James Bowen for writing this incredible book, and I recommend it without hesitation to all.
B000002KBD|5.0|Wow, ever since I've grown to appreciate Van's soulful vocal style, his music -especially the early albums- have really grown on me quite a bit.  I'm referring to Astral Weeks through Veedon Fleece.  Perhaps some of his later albums will appeal to me in the same way such as Wavelength.<br /><br />We all know the hit song \\"Domino\\".  It's a pretty good song though I admit I spent most of my childhood not really thinking it was anything special.  With a newfound appreciation for Van's voice however, suddenly the song has transformed into an entirely different experience!  There's a couple other hits on here too.  \\"I've Been Working\\" with Van delivering a trademark vocal trick during the chorus that is TOTALLY what I associate with classic Van Morrison.  The way he sings \\"I've been grindin'!\\" and later \\"I said woman!\\" create a distinct magic that makes up Van's highly memorable singing style.  \\"Blue Money\\" is where Van's vocals lead into the \\"blue money\\" chorus and it's done in a really natural and catchy way.  The horns just make it richer.<br /><br />Now here's what's surprising- the REST of the material here is just as solid.  \\"Crazy Face\\" continues the soulful vibes but I gotta admit Van sort of screws the song up a little bit around the 1:10 mark when the horns irritatingly vibrate a REALLY annoying and repetitive tone for about 10 seconds.  What's up with that?  \\"Give Me a Kiss (Just One Sweet Kiss)\\" has really upbeat and catchy piano work and vocals.  \\"Call Me Up in Dreamland\\" is even catchier- a major high point on the album.  I love it.  \\"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\\" however, might be the lowest point.  Van's vocals sound different and if there's a melody, it's hard to find it.  The song needs a quicker pace.  I still wouldn't say I dislike it or anything irrational like that.  It's decent.  \\"Virgo Clowns\\" has wonderful acoustic playing and vocals that make me smile.  \\"Sweet Jannie\\" is more playful fun that's probably a minute or two too short.<br /><br />Now here's where the album seems to turn deeply sincere and more soulful than the rest of the material here.  \\"Gypsy Queen\\" starts off innocently enough with a playful child-like melody before morphing into pure soul.  \\"If I Ever Needed Someone\\" is a great Beatles cover... just kidding!  I knew it wasn't a Beatles cover since the Beatles song doesn't have the word \\"ever\\" in the title, but the thought crossed my mind that maybe Van tried to take that song, radically adjust the vocals, and make it his own.  Anyway Van feels like he's speaking directly to God in this song, and the high point of the entire album is the closer \\"Street Choir\\" with a chorus that comes close to bringing me to tears with the compassionate way Van delivers these lines \\"Why did you leave America, why did you let me down, and now that things seem better off, why do you come around, you know I just can't see you now, in my new world crystal ball, you know I just can't free you now, that's not my job at all\\".  Beautifully sung and REALLY moving on a personal note.<br /><br />Overall, His Band & the Street Choir is probably not as good as Astral Weeks, Veeden Fleece, Moondance or Saint Dominic's Preview, but it's probably his fifth best album.  I recommend it.
B002XTBE6K|3.0|Do not expect this to be a strict interpretation of Emma, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. I personally like Romola Garai, and for the most part I enjoyed watching her as the ever vain but good-natured Emma. But oftentimes I found myself cringing a bit-- Romola's Emma was occasionally a bit overdone.  My biggest pet-peeve (although something many modern viewers would not mind) was that she never carried herself the way a woman in Austen's age was expected to.  She frequently flopped into or slumped in chairs and bounded into rooms.  The camera work and set was very good, and the actors were well chosen for their parts, but aside from Mr. Knightley, the characters were approached a bit differently than what I have read and seen before.  Some additions were made to the storyline, such as the focus on the emotional difficulties of Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill over being separated from home as children...and the marriage between Emma's sister and Knightley's (grumpy/discontent) brother.

1416562605|3.0|The book is certainly a page-turner, no doubt about that, but the glory of the story fades after reading. Allow me to explain.<br />As a requirement for an exam, the book didn't seem to intriguing at first. I then realized that it gave me an immense view in the poverty-stricken world of rural India. I was enthralled, ecstatic, and captivated. Each page turned was a step in a thrilling journey, about one's man's success out of the slums. It was so vivid and detailed that I want to take a trip to see the dirt-stricken world (though I doubt I ever will). Even the major plot turner, that initially \\"grip\\" toward the beginning of the book, seemed great. But I then began to realize that maybe that \\"grip\\" was placed there for a reason: to get to the end, nothing more.<br /><br />Because the rest of the book begins to get into the mundane, quotidian narrative of the rest of the character's rise. I felt the author put too much length into the second half that he seemed to run out of the initial \\"juice\\" that kept the first half at a more heightened thriller level. I began to doubt the author's knowledge with that sort of livelihood, and, actually, the only reason I kept reading, besides it being an assignment, was because I wanted to see the resolve of the \\"grip.\\" (Sorry, don't want to give away too much.)<br /><br />It's a good read, but don't expect to come away from it much, except for a glance into rural Indian life.

B007WA56SC|4.0|I thought Parlophone was kind of quick to release another hits package after just two studio albums - X and Aphrodite.<br /><br />For a seasoned collector like myself, there's no reason to pick this one up. The Asia only CD + DVD release Kylie Hits would have covered the newer songs and videos post Ultimate Kylie. The older material on this Best Of are on Ultimate Kylie (both CD + DVD).<br /><br />The Best Of Kylie Minogue would be a better bet In the Western context or for Kylie debutantes anywhere, since it would feature some selections from her last two studios (All The Lovers, Get Outta My Way, Wow, In My Arms). Missing videos like 2 Hearts, The One, All I See and Giving You Up can be found on the Asian Hits DVD.<br /><br />Songs like 2 Hearts, Better Than Today, Put Your Hands Up and Higher (with Taio Cruz) could have been included instead of repeating hits from previous collections.<br /><br />I find the cover highly attractive but I  will look forward to the next Kylie project :)

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|At first I thought the game would be Corney, but after playing a couple rounds I like it. I hope there will be a part two to this game.
1451627289|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the best books that Mr. King has ever written!  It is important to note that it is NOT a typical Stephen King 'horror' story.  But it IS 850+ pages of a riveting storyline, excellent character development, and over the top suspense occurring throughout the book.  I was 11 when President Kennedy was shot--and remember where I was (the whole 6th grade class had walked downstreet to the town library to take out books) when we first got the news that he was dead.  Maybe that had something to do with my eagerness to read this story, maybe not.  But I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing from the first page to the last.  It's big, but read so easily that it seemed I was finished before I'd hardly started.  It's not often that I stay up past 1:00 AM on a work night to read, and it takes a special book to make me do that; THIS was a special book that will stay with me far beyond the usual day or two of what I call, 'book thought'.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|I was appalled by the abuse suffered by Dominique at the hands of the Karolyi's and her father.  That the Karolyi's were such heroes in the gymnastics world is pitiful.  USA gymnastics has some housecleaning to do.  Dominique's story was brave and insightful.  I am very glad she was able to reconcile with her father towards the end of his life.  This was a great memoir and very well written.  Thank you for this book!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I never utilize the income part. I just like it to keep track of what and when something is due. My life is HECTIC and I appreciate the reminder that a bill is coming due so I don't let it slip by without paying on time. And, the reminder comes back daily until I enter that it's paid.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I've read several David Baldacci books and some I have found wanting.  Improbable plots,<br />slowly paced, not completely holding my attention.  However, The Innocent was a fine<br />book.  It kept me guessing until the end and I was concerned about the characters.<br />Good work, Mr. Baldacci! JFM
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run.  it sounds boring but it is the best app ever made.  Since it is on the kindle fire it is even better than ever.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Loved it - Must read!! I loved this book. It was so well written that I could not put it down. I am surprised that this has not been made into a movie yet. You must read Point of Retreat, which is the next book in this series.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Glad we selected this movie to add to our library.  Great history movie to pass along to all of my immediate family members.
B00594XOZU|5.0|14-year-old female! Single&lt;3 Looking for guys:p Clean only!! hehe:D Close to my age!! I love Kik! It's amazing! I love talking to more than one person at a time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book grabbed me from the very start and kept me up late for three nights long after I should have gone to bed.  I highly recommend it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved it!! Kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen next. I could not put this book down.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I was a fan of the I Spy series as a child and Paranormal Agency brings back that nostalgic feel. G5 has created another amazing game that will surely take hours of my free time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|if age village kindle fire<br /><br />not a bad game Mindanao fun to play. addictive game.  good review needs to be shorter and not like other apps.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this author!  This is probably my favorite book of hers but they were all good!  I can't recommend it enough!
B0009ZHJ7S|4.0|I first saw this movie sitting in an urgent care waiting room with my two older kids while my youngest got stitches. I kid you not. The older ones liked it, so we vowed to get it for the poor little guy who was getting his face stitched up. I don't think he ever even watched it because he's only 3. Well, he's 4 now, and he's doing fine, thank you. But the older ones watched it again and liked it. And the little one will watch it, eventually, if we can ever find it under all the junque in our toy-littered home. Anyway, if you're like me and somehow you'd never seen this movie, check it out. It's not bad. And you can get it CHEAP!!
0345803507|5.0|THIS WAS MY FAVORITE IN THE SERIES - HOPE E.L.JAMES CONTINUES WITH THIS STORY.<br />THE 3 BOOKS WERE AN EASY READ AND KEPT YOUR INTEREST - BOOK 2 & 3 WERE THE BEST!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app!  Having the verses on one place, advancing to the next one automatically, are great features, as well as the audio features.
B000S5963Y|5.0|If anyone truly appreciates hard rock as a legitimate genre, as I do myself, The Cult's Sonic Temple is a prime example of straightforward hard rock at its best.<br /><br />This album is clearly produced, straightforward, constantly driving, and full of rock and roll energy. And this is not one of those complex, slickly produced albums with tons of hooks, diversions, bridges or other distractions -- this is in-your-face rock -- no holds barred. Just the way us hard rock enthusiasts like it.<br /><br />This album, to me, represents the last of a great dying breed of rock: the straight up, unembellished, rock-for-rock sake, three chord rock -- with a swagger!<br /><br />I recommend this album (along with The Cult's Electric) to anyone who loves rock that takes no prisoners.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|This movie was awesome.. great acting, awesome story line and plot.. two amazing twists.. the ending was absolutely fantastic.. not what you would expect at ALL, and the writers defiantly put some thought into this script.  I'm not really sure whats up with all the negative reviews.. I guess it depends on the kind of movie goer you are.. seems like these people are gung ho movie critics, but for a thriller flick.. fantastic.  I don't have anything bad to say about it at all... good acting, good storyline, good twist, good ending.. what else could you ask for?
B0081KTI0E|3.0|its an okay horror film but i felt it still had a lot to be desired but definitly not bad you should rent it
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It's amazing! Has great editing things and uploads to Facebook great. A must have app. It was a &quot;Free app pf the day&quot; one day. You are lucky if you got it then.
B006KSAPV0|4.0|Pedro Almod&oacute;var continues to craft an impressive cinematic career by paying the best type of homage to Alfred Hitchcock--without blatantly copying Hitchcock, Almod&oacute;var appropriates his style, his tone, and his penchant for terrifying subject matter and translates these elements into original, contemporary stories that Hitchcock himself would have surely told if he were alive today and living in Spain.<br /><br />\\"The Skin I Live In\\" focuses on Robert Ledgard (played by Antonio Banderas in what is undoubtedly the most sophisticated performance of his career), a plastic surgeon who has endured more than his share of tragedy--an unfaithful wife who suffers a horribly disfiguring accident, a traumatized daughter unable to cope with her family's misfortune and other indignities, and a childhood and family history of his own that is shrouded in mystery. As he himself slips into madness, Ledgard uses his skill as a surgeon to exact a most horrifying type of revenge on the man who seemingly damaged his daughter beyond repair--and then uses that revenge in a gruesome charade that satisfies his longing for the happiness that has long since left him.<br /><br />In telling this contemporary Gothic tale, Almod&oacute;var tackles a number of grand themes--power, love, delusion, desire--in a way that exploits our preconceptions of gender and identity. \\"The Skin I Live In\\" is a unique film. If you're already an Almod&oacute;var fan, you'll surely enjoy it. If you're not, it will almost certainly turn you into one.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|tha ease of using it on my blackberry or kindle fire N computer is awesome.  I love this app! I recommend it to anyone
B008COD5OO|5.0|its a great party movie and i also liked the way it was filmed as found footage and all the wacky shit that they did for this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|What is up with the 1 star reviews? This game had almost entirely 5 star reviews until recently. Sounds like someone made a youtube video for temple run bated and told them to give it a low rating. Some people have even said that you have to spend money to get far. That is NOT true. I have gotten all pickups maxed out and have used all utilities by just using coins that I have earned in the game. I even got a 25000 coin character without spending a single cent of my own. THIS GAME IS SO EPIC YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!!!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I never got into them in their prime so now I'm discovering them at an older age...this CD is brilliant through one listen. Very much worth getting.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great App!!! Fast paced, highly  addictive, good for all ages and excellent game to play the entire family.  I would recomend this game to anyone.  5 Stars!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|best game I have ever and I mean ever played if you agrea. rate 5 stars if you wood for me
B007WPM4P0|4.0|I love war movie's and I love a good Love story. This was both and I enjoyed watching. Can't wait for the next season, so I can continue to watch.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Challenging puzzles that get progressively harder. It takes a long time to get through all of the games so it feels like you get your money's worth. Kind of like Sudoku so if you love those games, you'll love this!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Paranormal Agency...good concept but it got my wife possessed by the devil! I started playing this app, I dug it until my wife's eyes rolled back in her head and she started speaking in tongues. Then she barfs split pea soup on me so I had to kill her... with an eggplant! I would give this app a negative 15 stars but then the devil would try to kill me with a toothpick, so I give it one!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so addicted I played it for three hours non-stop and I didn't even relize it!!!!!!!!! so freaking fun fun fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0055S348W|5.0|Highly recommend this app...personally use it with my fire kindle. I was very skeptical about it working. I was surprised  in how easily it works and connects with my printer via Wi-fi. Believe me when I say it's well worth it!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is one of the best games that I have ever played.<br />this is also a funny game too
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Would truly love this game if it would work correctly. we all have the same problem....not allowing your turn when it saids it is. No way would I ever pay for something that doesn't work 98% of the time. Updates seem to make it worse.Hope one day\year you will fix it and it stays fixed. Would actually love this game if it worked correctly each time
B005R5U5B2|5.0|I love this album.<br /><br />i am a huge directioner.Any directioner needs this album.or any fan of 1D..Their singing is like angels were sent to me. Their looks.(dont get me started.but lets just say they are some good looking boys.) their personalities make the world stop. And this may not be about the album but its true and every lyric in these songs describe it(:<br /><br />DIRECTIONER FOREVER.AND THATS WHAT MAKES THEM BEAUTIFUL.
B00004WG2F|2.0|Where are the good writers?  What was this supposed to be?  If you like a contrived plot, cardboard characters, stupid dialogue, you will love this movie.  Alright, the scenary was wonderful, hence the two stars.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I locve love love love love LOVE this game! I can not put it down! 5 out of 5 stars! I def reccomend this game! great on the kindle fire
B007VGXS8M|3.0|This app was good...at first. But after you go through all the levels it's very boring. I kind of regret getting this app.
B004KPLZKA|5.0|Cher's new album is completely amazing.I am totally obsessed with her album.The album features slow songs and fast up-beat songs you want to dance along with.This album makes me see how different a person can be.She is one of the best women rappers i have ever heard(along with Nicki Minaj..This album has some spit fire songs that leave me wondering how she did it.Over all i give this album 5/5(:
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't know what this game was like for smart phones but it is a perfect game for the Kindle, and at $0.00 it is a must have!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this game is addoctinh and mysterious. most games.like this I don't like bit this one is different... I actually love this game
B000FA5STS|5.0|This is Baldacci at his best, he is one of todays best thriller and mistery writers,an absorbing read which is dificult to put down
B000MKD9P6|4.0|I'm normally good at predicting how movies will end but i was waaayyy off on this one.<br />I enjoyed it but i was sad when she stopped working for the magazine. :(
B006RUJST6|1.0|-SPOILERS-<br />I'm amazed at the high rating this book has, I genuinely did not enjoy it. Nevertheless, I ploughed through because I wanted to give it a chance to redeem itself, it did not.<br /><br />I've just finished reading Slammed, and the main emotion coursing through my veins is frustration. The characters are neither well developed nor likable. The main character (Lake) behaves like a spoilt brat through-out the book, there is no point in which she redeems herself or shows she's mature enough to look after herself, much less her brother. She comes off as selfish and petulant, more concerned with her crush liking her back than about his well being. He explains a few times why they cannot be together, and it makes perfect sense, really it does (he needs this job, he needs the money to look after his brother, and by being in a relationship with her, he jeopardises this) but she just refuses to accept this and acts out by writing bad poetry and laughing at him when he tries to explain once again, why they cannot be together.<br /><br />Also, while we're TOLD there is some amazing attraction between Lake and Will, we never get to SEE it. They are wildly attracted to one another on first sight, crazy about each other after one date, then madly in love after a month, how? Why?? And it's not as if they spend that one month getting to know each other better, they spend it annoyed with each other half the time and mooning after the other person the other half. Their \\"love\\" is unconvincing to me.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the poetry aspect either, I suppose it was a device for the author to develop the characters further, delve into all their deep and dark emotion, but all it did for me was add another layer of angst to an already exasperating plot.<br /><br />And the repeated use of the line \\"That's not a good idea\\" is annoying, not charming.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very addictive I cant put it down and there are so many more pic to do.. I would diffinetly recommend it to everyone
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Its a great pic shop 2use make the picture the why u Want it. Put different colors. Ianthe back round put sticker the way unwanted it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game you just run out of energy really fast. so far it has been a blast.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good could be better but good all in all its good. I don't like some of the games but oh well
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun but bate having to bye acorns worth it for free but not to bye let us win corns like coins and you would have a lot more people wanting to play
B007IXWKUK|1.0|These books must have been written by either a 16 year old or someone with the mentality of one. The writing was poor and the concepts even less so. All I can think of is that this author must have one hell of a publisher to get so much hype about a dung hill. Of course- a few reviewers said that they had to actualy Google BDSM- so for people like that I can understand how all these books must be considered lurid. Another reviewer had never heard of a butt plug. Really?<br /><br />But all that aside- the characters are shallow and one dimensional, and the author writes about a lifestyle that she has no idea about. Brava to the wonderful publisher for pushing this on everyone and getting them to buy it.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|The opening songs, \\"Think About the Days\\" and \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" seem to proffer a very desirable promise: we are to be treated to Brian Wilson's mastery of gorgeous melancholy harmonies and his high-quality tune craft - the \\"Radio\\" song is hitmaking at its best.<br /><br />The promise is exhilarating; this is excellent stuff. But as the third song (\\"Isn't it Time\\") begins, a suspicion creeps in, and by the next one (\\"Spring Vacation\\") it is confirmed: we're in well-trod territory of four-square tempos and rehashed, forgettable melodies. Just hearing that same old beat, after a whole intervening era during which rhythms were developed to a high point of sophistication, is wearying. The clangy surf guitar - once a great pleasure - has been \\"updated\\" with a richer sound and some more elaborate solos, unfortunately they don't sound modern, but rather like slick leftovers of the eighties, perhaps by Journey.<br /><br />Things continue in this vein: Wilson puts together songs that compel you to let yourself be drawn in and whistle along; songs that are undemanding and sort of sound great because of that terrific harmonic structure he practically owns, and which we've come to associate with youth, summer, and careless fun. However, they lack memorable vocal riffs and each sounds much like the previous one. Occasionally,  they steal from the old canon just a tiny bit. The first line of the chorus in \\"Shelter\\" is straight out of \\"Don't worry, Baby.\\"<br /><br />Amid this Wilsoniana, Mike Love offers us a song of his own, \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean,\\" which sounds essentially like the Wilson songs -- in this context, that's not a compliment: it drags along sleepily, is neither very good nor terrible, has no shelf life in one's mind, and sports particularly insipid lyrics.<br /><br />By \\"Beaches in Mind\\" and \\"Strange World,\\" boredom has firmly set in. \\"From There to Back Again\\" suddenly brings us awake; and the next two songs, \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\" are of the same cloth --Brian has dug deep into his bag of sad harmonies; his songwriting skills here are intact, his ability to somehow squeeze out-of-ordinary chord progressions, introspection, and sheer beauty into what we call \\"pop\\" music is uncanny.<br /><br />So, a mediocre medley is sandwiched between some gorgeous memories of great musicianship. As for the lyrics, they are often affecting, especially if you're a sixties' child yourself. \\"Sometimes I realize my days are getting on,\\" Brian sings in a troublingly melancholy song, adding, in the next one, \\"Summer's gone... old friends have gone their separate ways... we laugh, we cry, we live, then die and dream about our yesterday.\\"<br /><br />Nostalgia was always Brian's stock-in-trade; even during the ever-happy beginnings of the band, he snuck in an occasional \\"In My Room,\\" until Pet Sounds  ended the era and introduced a new nostalgia, verging on depression, of a surfer boy now grown up and facing true heartbreak and alienation (\\"Caroline, No\\"; \\"I Wasn't Made for these Times\\"). Brian's solo career reprised the theme and his effort with Van Dyke Parks, \\"Orange Crate Art,\\" was almost entirely dedicated to it.<br /><br />The big question is: Shouldn't Brian Wilson renew himself? Shouldn't he innovate, progress? He is one of the most important musicians of the sixties, who defined the era in an inimitable way. It's precisely his innovative approach to sound and song structure that took him out of the pleasant but hardly immortal surf music to something special and distinct. Pet Sounds was his crowning achievement, but he seems to've gotten stuck at that plateau. Not a bad place to be stuck in, you might say, but the thing is, if you get stuck at your apex, then you have to be able to maintain that level of quality. This has not been the case since then, and certainly isn't the case on \\"That's Why God Made the Radio,\\" although there are a few glimpses of possibility. Besides, geniuses need to go on and keeptesting their creativity, even if we don't like the product of it.<br /><br />As for the meaning of the reunion of the Beach Boys, I'm not sure there is one beyond the obvious financial value. The original crew, sadly, isn't there, and as for the rest -- have they truly let bygones be bygones? From the musical perspective, it's immaterial. The Beach Boys were a group of friends and family, and this made them a pleasure to watch playing together. As a recording band, they don't exist. Brian Wilson's solo recordings provide ample evidence that, when it comes to that distinct Beach Boys sound, he is the band. The songs are Brian, the instrumentation is Brian, and he has never had any trouble finding the necessary voices to carry the harmonies he heard in his mind; in the studio, he even did awfully well providing backup vocals in different registers. Listen to 1988's \\"Brian Wilson\\" (for my money, a better, album than the present one), and specifically the song \\"One for the Boys,\\" and this becomes clear.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the evernote app works across platforms and keeps all my notes organized and easily searchable. love it for work and keeping track of recipes.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I just finished Gone Girl and I could not be more frustrated.<br /><br />The plot is interesting at the start, then toward the middle it becomes almost painful to read.  You could actually skip about 6-8 chapters and not miss a beat.  While you are reading it there is a hope it is not going to end the way you just think it may end, and THEN IT DOES.  It's completely unsatisfying and a bit annoying.  Actually, when I finished the book I was annoyed.<br /><br />The writer tells the story by Amy's diary and Nick's perspective.  It goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  I think if the writer would have told the story with more perspectives it would have been more interesting.  I also think that the ending was horrible and unfinished.<br /><br />This could have been a great great thriller with the right ending and a different narrative style.<br /><br />I have read each of Gillian Flynn's novels and enjoyed them both, especially sharp objects which I actually picked for our book club to read.  The reviews on the book are mostly positive which befuddles me as I was so disappointed in it.  If you haven't read anything by this author, by all means read her first two, this I would borrow from the library if you are compelled to read it.
B007P6VM04|5.0|Have enjoyed this album with its wonderful songs that bring back memories of the first season of the show. I'm already looking forward to the next album!
B00022LRXA|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of Brian Eno's career. And I say that as a fan who's mostly interested in Eno's instrumental music, not his vocal records.<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with the latter. Eno has a great voice, in my opinion -- not typical of pop music, to be sure, which always seems to value brassy tenors over baritones. It's just that his instrumental work has been so unusual, influential and arresting.<br /><br />\\"Before and After Science\\" is, above all else, a GREAT rock record. Side one (showing my age; oops) just burbles with energy, from the angular \\"No One Receiving\\" to the rather manic \\"King's Lead Hat\\" (an anagram, for those who haven't read up on it yet, for Talking Heads, with whom Eno has worked extensively). There's even an instrumental in the mix, the pensive, beautiful \\"Energy Fools the Magician.\\"<br /><br />Side two, though, is the classic side here -- one of the greatest album sides in popular music history. \\"Here He Comes\\" is absolutely gorgeous; it really is ear candy with intelligence. \\"Julie With ...\\" is a much slower-tempo, thoughtful song that drifts through your listening room like smoke. Eno composed \\"By This River\\" with members of Cluster, and the song has a melancholy, kind of otherworldly feel to it. \\"Through Hollow Lands\\" is another ghostly instrumental, this one dedicated to Harold Budd, with whom Eno recorded \\"The Plateaux of Mirror\\" and \\"The Pearl\\" (both highly recommended). Finally, the album closes with \\"Spider and I,\\" a very haunting vocal piece with a distinct meldoy; I can hear it playing in my head as I write this, and I haven't listened to it for some time.<br /><br />\\"Before and After Science\\" is one of my two favorite Eno vocal records, the other being \\"Another Day on Earth.\\" It's a must for every Eno fan, and indeed can be considered essential listening for anyone who values British rock from the 1970s.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|What the title said. The controls are pretty simple but responsive. It works well for me on the kindle. And fornthe low price of free I'd pick it up.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As a long-term fan of Macs and all the Apple gear, I was a little fearful of reading the stories behind the creation of this elegant raft of products.  However, it was gripping throughout, despite some annoying repetition and flashbacks which had me gritting my teeth.  For instance, the number of men tearing up, crying, weeping and becoming emotional made me want to send them all a course of testosterone.  Something about the way these scenes were expressed ad infinitum was quite nauseating and somewhat unnecessary and lacking in credibility (even though it must have been someone's memory as Isaacson is a scrupulous biographer). Flashbacks that reiterated background and action were placed in such a way that they reminded me of commercial television programmes (insert teaser here, now play the re-cap, now a cliff-hanger).<br /><br />Hard not to sympathise with Isaacson though as this would not have been an easy project.  I just felt that the book suffered from a sales deadline, could have had another edit prior to release to cut the fat and insert some more 'sides' to story rather than the indulgence of reminding us of what had been clearly established in many places earlier in the narrative.  Often the timeline was, therefore, confusing, going back and forth and not really clear what the story arc's supporting components were to be - models of computers? other products? people who were partners? conflicts?  TO me it appeared as though there had been no plan for the book and that this was a little random.  It is, of course, is easy for a reader to say and one could slog away at such a highly anticipated biog. for decades and never get it out to awaiting readers.  Ultimately though, it was a terrific and entertaining read with some amazingly frank interviews.  The number of times I said 'whaaaaaat???' was impressive.  It is a shame that people of 'genius' appear to need the arsehole factor in such large quantities and worse still that being a genius seems to make it OK to be a complete pig.<br />I appreciate and enjoy books like this enormously, but hope that in the near future, there will surely be more written about Jobs that will flesh out the umpteen questions I had when I finished reading this one.
1402786360|5.0|I follow the Sprinklebakes blog and I love it.  So naturally I was so excited about her 1st cook book and she did not disappoint.  I have made several recipes from her book and they were delicious, but there was a show stopping recipe....BANANA PUDDING CAKE. What?!?!?! When I made this cake for my family, they went bananas! Her instructions are easy to follow and the results are outstanding. Great Job Heather!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this is sooo stupid!!!!!!!!! it wont even let me watch the bid I wanna watch. it comes up with some random vid. DONT GET THISS APP'!!!!!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|So far - very satisfied. Comfortable fit, easy to adjust volume control, does not require software installation if you don't want to use 7.1 sound (I did not install it after reading some complaints about it), good base, good noise insulation, people on the other end hear me well. For $90 dollars - great headset.<br />Some downsides: may feel a bit bulky for some; your ears might sweat a bit (especially if you want to exercise wearing this set). I'd give it 5 stars if it had a little more ventilation but it is probably not possible for over-the-ear cups.
B0008237BO|5.0|Its no secret that Pac recorded this album in 7 days. He locked himself in the studio with 2 unknown producers and completed the entire album in 7 days. This album was intended to be an underground bootleg album initially but when Pac died Suge decided to release it commercially and thank God he did.<br /><br />All tracks are laced with hardcore venom and rage. You can feel the intensity within Pac while recording this album. Suge said he called him at 3am one morning and told him to come over to his house immediately. When Suge got there, Pac told him he wanted the artwork to be him on a cross because he felt that the media was crucifying him and that he was meant to be an example of. Suge has Ronald \\"Riskie\\" Brent start the artwork which we now see is the Makaveli album unfortunatley Pac never got to see it. It was also known that Suge and Pac were listening to the album in Las Vegas when he got shot in the car.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Bomb First\\" is one of the hottest and most potent tracks ever recorded. Raw and gangster. \\"Hail Mary\\" comes in next and has one of the tightest beats in hip hop today and has some of Pac's best lyrics over this raw beat. Amazing! \\"Toss It Up\\" has a cool vibe and the video has everyone drunk on the beach with Suge in tow and everyone was just chilling to it. \\"To Live and Die In LA\\" is the second part to California Love and has a real smooth beat you can just ride to.<br /><br />The album begins to get even more personal with tracks such as \\"White Manz World\\" and \\"Hold Ya Head\\". \\"Against All Odds\\" is an all out war on east cost rappers that turned on Pac. Its up there with Hit em Up and we can feel the heat from the track. Quite honestly, this is probably Pac's best work on many levels. A true testament to the best rapper of all time. Get this album if you haven't as yet, you won't regret it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great way to exercise your brain. Its fun and yet still peaceful. The music is perfect and the game runs so smoothly.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|This effort by Rush is OK, nothing great, not a must have. Not nearly as good as Moving Pictures or Perm Waves or ANYTHING prior. I stopped buying Rush albums after Perm Waves so maybe this album is good relative to all their work POST Perm Wave. To me the songs are meandering, a lot of it sounds the same after a while. A few of the songs are overly long. Let me put it this way: think if the Ramones put out songs that were 7-8 min long. Those songs would get boring after 3 min. Well that is my feeling with some of the songs on this Rush album. Anyways, the last song is about the only one that stands out. The rest is ho-hum. I wish these guys would go full blown Rush 1 style ROCK, or, go \\"SCI-FI\\" with bass-pedal synth and long space-like rock like the days of 2112, Hemispheres, Farewell To Kings. Maybe next time. Glad to see these guys are still writing music but I'll pass on this one.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|This is my third PowerA controller for the PS3.  The first two were wired, and the last one I bought was wireless.  I like the way the controller feels, and it is very similar, in layout, to the 360 controller, which I must admit I prefer.  I have found a few problems with these controllers.  First, the rubber pads over the analog sticks tend to rip over time.  Second, precision aiming is not easy with these (it has been a long time since I have used anything else, so it may just be par for the course).  Third, the analog sticks get stuck.  This can really screw you up, espcially when aiming, and moving!  This has been a problem on all three controllers, but the wireless one seems to have developed this problem much earlier.  I would give it a higher rating if these problems went away.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead is easily one of the most addictive television shows of all time, and they have the numbers to prove it. Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal are a killer duo that take you on an emotion-tugging journey in a world of the undead.
B0078XMA6O|5.0|I'm judging this album on its songwriting and musicianship (not studio production choices).  This is the album I've been wanting from The Cranberries since \\"Everybody Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We.\\"<br />Melodic.<br />Quieter but still catchy.<br />Delightful.<br /> and<br />Beautiful.<br /><br />It has been almost 20 years since I've had a Cranberries album I loved all the way through.<br /><br />Thank you for making this album.
B000002MIB|3.0|I'm a fan of Van Halen, with the ORIGINAL lineup that included David Lee Roth. While the sound quality on this CD is pretty good, it's not VH to me. At this point in their career the Van Halen bros are branching out with piano, combined with Sammy's high pitched tone. Just doesn't cut it for me. However, the sound here is clean. The best part of this CD for me is Anthony's bass playing, Eddie's guitar playing and \\"Aint Talkin Bout Love\\". I just don't understand why these guys didn't record earlier era VH songs for this CD. I'm sure Sammy could've sang those DL Roth songs. Not a bad CD but I will never buy a Sammy-era VH. Van Hager era songs are just not as good to me. Their a different band.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Great game and very enjoyable. Only issue is that an unexpected error occurs and forces me to close the app. Very annoying and makes my food spoil. I don't have this issue with the app on my iPhone 4. I think its the aneroid system. Never the less, it's a great game to play.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|Since I love anything \\"Chick Lit,\\" I decided to pick up a book from my shelf by a favorite author. Sophie Kinsella wrote the Shopaholic series and did not disappoint with this novel. It's a cute read heavy on all of the major chick-lit components (nice shoes, fancy bags, designer lipsticks, and fancy clothing) with a nice mystery twist. When the main character Lexi wakes up in a hospital in much better shape financially than when she began, the mystery of how she got there unwinds.  I enjoyed her journey and unraveling the clues that lead her to her current reality and agree with her pick for love in the end. This book is pretty fluffy and light, but was entertaining as Sophie Kinsella always is. If you're looking for a quick read filled with fun, this is a good pick.
0345528581|5.0|In response to 'most useful' negative review.  Yes, equipment does help, but there's a lot you can do without it.  My guess is that there are plenty of service men and women using at least some of Lauren's ideas in the field where equipment is totally unavailable. And, the book is useful in helping you make up your own workout plans with or without equipment.  Both my wife and myself use the book (along with others); we devise our 'own' plans based on the results we want, and what we are capable of accomplishing.  We like the way he breaks the book into specific exercises for specific muscle groups.  I'm 60 and my wife is 58.  We workout daily, both for fitness and to help correct damaged and deteriorating bodies :-)
B004WKOCP8|2.0|On this beast album Brandon's voice sounds a little worn out and when he sings the words it just doesn't have that uumph it once had. And the melodies on this album is decades old. I feel like I'm listening to a 1980's album , not a current album.
B0088TG252|4.0|Pretty good movie but not great,maybe because I've seen to manny of this kind.As usual Denzel W. plays awesome :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down! In fact, I read it cover-to-cover in a little over three hours. Suzanne Collins writes in such a vivid and complete way. I was immediately immersed in the world of Panem and fell in love with the characters. For those of you living in a hole with no television or Internet access, The Hunger Games is the first book in a young adult trilogy. It follows the trials of young heroine Katniss Everdeen, who begins the book by volunteering to take her little sister's place in the brutal Hunger Games. Although the book can be a bit violent in nature, it is written for the young adult reader and stays away from any real depictions of gore. The underlying themes of unity, friendship, and true love are explored in a most powerful way. The book ends leaving you desperate to find out what happens to Katniss and her world. I cannot wait to get started on Catching Fire!<br /><br />On a side note, I rushed out to see the newly released film adaptation of The Hunger Games as soon as it came out. Ordinarily I am disappointed by the film versions of my favorite books, but in this case I was more than a little happily surprised. The film follows the book almost to the letter, and I had the feeling of turning the pages as I watched. I found myself catching little moments and details in the film that I might not have otherwise appreciated if I had not read the book first. I would recommend reading the book and then seeing the film, which has plans to follow-up with the subsequent books. Enjoy!
0345803493|5.0|I heard alot of things about this series of books and I must say I am glad I ordered these.  This may have been one of the best reads I have bought yet.  I wont even let anyone borrow my set because its something you could go back and read again and again.  Awesome love story and it made you not want to put the book down.  Book 2 I read in 48 hours.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins set the bar extremely high with the first two books of the Hunger Games Trilogy, and Mockingjay followed suit. I am amazed at how I am drawn into the unruly world of Panem with each sentence.<br />Mockingjay ramped up the violence quite a bit and for me became a book for adults- not teens. The strife and hate running rampant in the streets is horrifying and real to the reader. I was pleased to see the development of Katniss' inner struggle with her relationship between the two men in her life.<br />I have to admit that I was a tad disappointed in the ending. I felt like it ended quite abruptly in an easy, not-quite-satisfying manner. On a positive note, even though this trilogy is over, I felt that the ending left room for another series.... Please see my spoiler alert for my \\"real\\" gripe and idea for a future Hunger Games spin-off.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />It is quite possible that the reason I really disliked the ending of Mockinjay is because I was rooting for Gale and secretly wanted Katniss to end up with him and not Peeta. Throughout the book I was conflicted in who I thought she should be with, but by the end of book three I was convinced that Gale was her man.<br />As for my hopes for the future, I think a series focusing on the new world of Panem and the child of Katniss and Peeta would be amazing. There is so much material to be explored in growing up in the shadow of such a harrowing past with such famous parents. I implore Suzanne Collins to write more!!
B007549W62|2.0|I really enjoy dark movies of various genres- horror, science fiction, drama, etc.  So I was eager to watch \\"The Divide\\",  which is from director Xavier Gens (who also directed \\"Hitman\\").  The movie did quite well on the film festival circuit, where it was nominated for best feature film at both the SXSW Festival and the Toronto After Dark Festival.  So this isn't supposed to be your standard late-night cable cheesy apocalyptic movie.<br /><br />While the cast isn't full of A-list actors, there are quite a few you will likely recognize (namely Milo Ventimiglia, Michael Biehn, and Rosanna Arquette).  The plot involves a diverse group of people who are forced to hide out in an underground bunker after their city gets hit by a nuclear attack.  There is obviously quite a bit of conflict between the characters, as well as some external forces.  The confined people's behavior starts getting darker and darker, and there are some haunting occurrences down there.<br /><br />While the movie is wonderfully shot and has solid acting and music, the plot just couldn't keep me interested.  The two hour running time felt long to me.  The movie also introduced a subplot involving other inhabitants about 20 minutes in, but never resolved it or explained it, which was annoying.  The final shot of the movie is haunting, but unfortunately, it did not make up for the rest of the movie.
1401923127|5.0|this is a wonderful, enlightening, educational book.  I am still reading it, and highlighting what I want to go back and review later.  I will probably read the whole book again.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Such a fun song!  Love it!  She's funky, not out there half-dressed, shaking everything all over the place.  Just a plain nice kid.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|Timothy Ferris clearly thinks quite highly of himself and doesn't hesitate to let you know how superior he is to you in every way in this incredibly long (592 pages) doorstop of a book. In it he professes to have the solution to many of your health woes and promises to help you accomplish such things as \\"Sleep 2 hours per day and perform better than on 8 hours.\\" (I'll spare you the pain of reading his incredibly scientific and boring explanation by telling you that this requires an unbelievably complicated schedule of sleeping a few minutes at a time all day long. If you're blessed by the type of lifestyle where you don't have to work or interact with other human beings in any way, this might work for you).<br />Ferris' idea of a healthy life is chock full of supplements and expensive testing. He subjects himself to a myriad of experiments and has found success in his trials, but any adult with an actual job and family obligations could never afford the pills and gadgets he touts as lifesavers. I am thankful that I got this book from the library and didn't waste the $26.95 it costs to buy the book.<br />Besides being incredibly scientific and difficult to read, Ferris is simply too cocky and stuck on himself to gain my trust.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona Apple isn't the most prolific of artistes. She has taken seven years to come up with this new effort and you could be forgiven when first seeing the title that that she has gone a bit odd. However, this is a very assured album that is well worth the wait. When I first heard it I felt underwhelmed, I played it on my stereo and I found it diverting but not quite worth the hype. However, I switched to headphones and it really began to work its magic - it has done ever since. The reason I feel that it works better is due to the intimate feel of some of the tracks. Take lead single and opening track Every Single Night as an example. It is sparsely arranged with hints of Joanna Newsom and barely any instruments at all for a lot of the running. However, it seeps into your consciousness with its minimal approach and lyrics (which seems to be about her inner demons).<br /><br />Whereas Newsom goes for strings Apple seems to focus on percussion and using unusual instruments to give the beat. Periphery sounds like it could have a bag of gravel being dragged for the percussion, yet it works in combination with the piano beautifully. The lyrics take some digging into and will linger long afterwards - Apple surely has been troubled during her time. Her music sounds like an experimental Tori Amos at times (Daredevil in particular which is a real stand out track). She is sometimes angry - again Daredevil and the rather brilliant Hot Knife which closes proceedings. Sometimes she is almost whispering. However its always captivating.<br /><br />Sometimes music is worth the wait and in this instance it really is. This is an original and quite wonderful offering. I am struggling to dislike any tracks and am playing this constantly.<br /><br />Tracklisting<br />1. Every Single Night<br />2. Daredevil<br />3. Valentine<br />4. Jonathan<br />5. Left Alone<br />6. Werewolf<br />7. Periphery<br />8. Regret<br />9. Anything We Want<br />10. Hot Knife
B0053O89JM|2.0|House was my absolute favorite television show of all time.  It should have ended with season 7.  This season (season 8) was an awful mess.  How something that was so amazing for so many years can take such an absolute nose dive so quickly is beyond me.  I'll miss the show but the terrible writing that I forced myself to sit through for the final season will help me let it go.  Ouch.
1582406723|5.0|Police officer Rick Grimes just woke up from a coma in the hospital, he discovers that the police is abandoned until he discovers strange dead-like people are devouring human beings but lucky for him he escaped from the hospital and finds out his town has gone through the same thing like in the hospital. He heads out of town to Atlanta to find his wife and son but unfortunately discovers the city has been infected too by the walking dead, he meets a friendly fellow named Glenn who takes him in the outside of the city where there is a safe haven of survivors including his wife and kid for they discovered a mysterious plague is causing the dead to rise.<br /><br />In the tradition of George Romero's zombie movie, this is the best horror comic of the last decade. Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore has conjured up a unique zombie story in 2003. Very much similar to 28 Days Later in it's opening of waking up to a different level of horror, i should say this one like Romero's zombie movies and that movie is a tale of survival instead of being a blood orgy like some other zombie movies mainly from Europe. This is a story about humanity and surviving an apocalyptic scenario in dramatic fashion as this has excellent artwork and fine writing with some emotion to it including some gore as well.<br /><br />If you love horror comics and the TV show, i suggest checking this one out to see where it all began.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book in The Hunger Games trilogy, I was eager to start on the second, and Suzanne Collins does not disappoint. She hits the ground running right where she left off and immediately draws you into the story. I don't want to reveal any spoilers in my blog, so I won't go into details, but Catching Fire has a twist I would never have seen coming! More about the love triangle created in book one is revealed, and I felt like this book really developed the depth of the main heroine, Katniss. Just as in the first book, Collins left me hanging at the end dying to know what comes next, and I began reading the third and final book of the series immediately. I just have to know what it to become of Katniss and Panem! If I had another star available, I'd certainly give it to Catching Fire!
0307472590|5.0|I read the Spanish version of \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.  This was my first book by the talented writer.  The narration is absolutely beautiful.  Cannot wait to read more of his books!
B000BD9PKM|5.0|I saw this one 50 years ago and forgot what a great movie it is. Will watch it several times in the coming weeks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased Wool Omnibus solely based on the book's intriguing description and countless fantastic reviews on Amazon.  After finishing the book a day ago, I am now adding one more 5-star review for this phenomenal series.  Brilliantly written, dramatically paced, and thoroughly engrossing.  Couldn't read it fast enough.<br /><br />I'm now anxious to get to Book 6 and probably the rest of this relatively unknown (not for long!) author's growing library.  According to Mr. Howey's website, the Wool series will go to at least Book 9.  I'm greatly looking forward to this future...
B0002XDODU|4.0|First off, I am a big Rammstein fan so I am admittedly biased when reviewing any of their recordings.<br /><br />In my opinion, Reise Reise is Rammstein's third best CD, behind Mutter and Sehnsucht.<br /><br />Highlights of Reise Reise are the title song, Mein Teil, Los, Amerika and Moskau.  It is an entertaining album that should be in the collection of any Rammstein fan.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a funny movie. Some parts are dorky but that is ok to me. My fav. parts I like in the movie is when Jack Nicholson is running with the nurses because he has to go potty. By the way nice butt Jack lol. The other part I like is when Jack is sleeping in Diane Keaton bed reading one of her books. She comes home from her date with the doctor and Jack is trying to get out of bed. He slide's off the bed and run's out of the room like a crazy man. TOO FUNNY!!!! With out Jack Nicholson I don't think this would be a great movie!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i would be playing it everyday if u could change where u r and the person
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Clear graphics and nifty sound effects make this a good Hidden Object game.  Story line is tedious but most of these games are like that.  You can skip dialogue if you wish.  So far the only negative is the unnecessary clutter on first screen trying to get you to try other G5 apps and FACEBOOK annoyance.  I just want to play without any distraction or connection to any social or other sites for any reason.  Overall, I like it but it could use some animations and better Puzzle Challenges like other (CHEAPER) apps that are BETTER.  Not worth $5 at all. Maybe $2 would be OK but still not as good as others.  4 stars because it was free today.
B001AYENBM|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies i have seen in a very very long time!!!!<br />:)Awesome<br />:)Cool<br />:)Exciting
B000FZETKC|4.0|I think this movie is pretty cool. It doesn't bet the other 80's movies like Bkf Club, Pretty In Pink, Sixteen Candles. But it does remind me of the movie Vally Girl in so many way's. Which is a movie that I love. I think Eric Stoltz is good in this movie, but I can't help but think of him in Mask as Rocky threw the whole movie. Which he did a great job in.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Fast paced, good action,.my favorite yet. I was afraid he had done one too many, but gave it a shot, very glad I did
B0053O89IS|2.0|As a long-time fan of this program, I was greatly anticipating season seven, only to be disappointed when the season's first episodes came out, full of creaky slapstick as Brennan and Booth were turned into charicatures of TV expectant parents.  I hoped these episodes were an aberration but they just got worse as the season went on, making the characters act in ways inconsistent with the personalities that had been developed so thoughtfully over the past six years.  Some cringe-worthy moments:  Angela so desperate to see her baby during the work day she hides him in a file cabinet, despite having on-site child care that she can visit at will?  Jack AND ANGELA so fearful of her father that they won't allow him to babysit their wakeful child -- who, SO predictably, drops off to sleep to his grandfather's electric guitar lullaby?  Jack turning into a machine junkie who has to be restrained by Cam's threats so he doesn't bankrupt the lab?  Brennan insisting on plunging alone into a prison riot while on the verge of giving birth?  Please.<br />It's obvious that Hart Hanson, bored with Bones, took the good writers with him to \\"The Finder\\" leaving Bones with a bunch of also-rans who can't restrain their impulses toward schlock, pratfalls, and predictability.  I couldn't finish watching the \\"birth in a manger\\" episode, and after that stopped recording altogether.  It hurts too much to watch what this once-wonderful series has devolved to.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First of all, let me say I'm no stranger to being entertained by poorly written books. Twilight is an overly dramatic, poorly written account of an over-bearing vampire who virtually ruins the life of his overly weak heroine. And I loved it.<br /><br />Fifty shades, however? It's not only poorly written. It borders on terrifying. And not because of all the bondage.<br /><br />Christian, our, er, 'prince', throws up so many red flags throughout this book--he repeatedly tells Ana he 'needs' to hurt her, he shows up at her mother's house in Georgia (when he lives in Seattle) totally uninvited and without having to even ask where she lives, he constantly needs to control her, he's jealous of her friends, he beats her with a belt...  The list goes on and on and on.  And the author seems to be trying to distract us from these flags by CONSTANTLY reminding how beautiful he is, rich he is, tortured he is, etc.  Seriously?<br /><br />And the only thing that Ana resembles is a classically abused woman--shy, stuttering, confused, blubbering and unable to reveal to her friends and family what's really going on with this man she 'loves.' She is mind-blowingly terrified of his potential rage, apologizing to the point of being pathetic and dancing around on eggshells so as not to 'upset' him. More than that, she's rationalizing all this poor treatment by reminding herself he was abused. Puh-leez. I wanted to shake the book and say, 'Hello, those are his issues, NOT yours!'<br /><br />If I COULD have gotten past the abuse enough to even be mildly interested in the sex scenes- they are not remotely believable.  Christian is somehow magically able to have sex continuously, with no 'breaks' in between.  Ana, though a virgin at the beginning of the book, magically finds sex immediately wildly pleasurable and is instantly turned on to the point of moaning every time Christian even so much as touches her hand. (Really? This man has admitted to wanting to beat you senseless and you, withno sexual experience, are still instantly TURNED on by this man?)<br /><br />I ploughed through the book thinking there would be some kind of revelation at the end--Christian would become normal or Ana would grow a spine.  And even though she leaves him briefly and he seems to be trying 'more,' neither happens.<br /><br />Horribly written.  No plot outside of bizarrely strung together sex scenes. A little bit like watching an inevitable trainwreck.  Will not be reading books 2 or 3.
B005OGYH90|4.0|This is a very good cd, has a mix of Guns and roses songs, with a few velvet revolver songs, and some of slash and myles own stuff, Myles is a great singer, He sounds almost similar to Axl, but can not come close to Scott Weilands range of vocals, But I really enjoy this CD! Slash's playing has me turning the volume all the way up in my car!!! Buy the Cd it is well worth the money, All songs are good, All songs are great and none disappointed with Slash's playing! Myles tears it up and sounds great on all the songs except the Velvet Revolver songs, he just cant compare to Scott Weilands singing..But pick it up its worth it
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was originally planning on buying only the first two movies on Blue-Ray. As I had no desire to own Alien 3 or Resurrection. However the set came up as a Gold Box deal and it was too good to pass up. It was a great choice, as the packaging is gorgeous and the additional discs with special features and documentaries are worthwhile for collectors. As for the quality of the movies themselves, they really outdid themselves. The picture quality of all the transfers are superb, even with the close to 40 year old original! They also include both the original and director's cuts for the films. Which are great for completionists. All in this was worth the money with the Gold Box deal. But even at full price, don't hesitate to buy the box set!
B007OWG3L2|5.0|There are many words to describe Sigur Ros' Valtari but beautiful is always the one the sticks out the most to me.  This isn't fast like Med Sud... or as slow and techno as Von.

B00009RDG9|3.0|The Hunted(released Mar/03)is a mediocre flick that has much in common in its dynamic with The Deer Hunter & Rambo.It's a PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder) flick that soon leaves one looking at the watch and wondering when it's going to end(watch watching is NEVER a good sign).The direction here by Friedkin is pedestrian at best and he just doesn't pique our interest long enough to keep us and hold on to us.<br />The film opens with a flashback to Kosovo in the late 90s.A village is getting razed to the ground and its inhabitants shot.A US special force is on the ground and is going after its leader. Aaron Hallam(Benicio Del Toro)is one of those members and he completes his objective.Back stateside he cannot forget the horrific images burned into his mind and he becomes a recluse.<br />Fast forward to Oregon a few years later and two deer hunters are out in the woods.It appears,however,they are there for more than deer as they find Hallam and it is not a reunion they are after.Soon after Hallam announces his presence to them they start shooting at him.He takes them out viciously and soon a manhunt is on for Hallam.<br />The special agency that Hallam was originally a part of recruits Hallam's former teacher one LT Bonham(Tommy Lee Jones).Bonham is an extraordinary tracker and within a short time he has his man.Bonham asked to do his job alone but the FBI follows him and assists in Hallam's take down.<br />While under interrogation some high level government agents show up and claim Hallam for their own.During transport Hallam manages to escape and Bonham is called back in to assist in the search.They almost get him in an underground construction site but he eludes them and lands at his ex wife's house.There Bonham follows and finds him sitting in an upstairs room.It's a quick visit as Hallam again escapes into a wooded area where Bonham tracks him down,for the final time.It's a fight to the finish against teacher Bonham and student Hallam.Both get in some good licks but in the end the outcome is inevitable.Bonham retires back to his home in BC,and is seen burning the letters Hallam had sent him long before.<br />Once Halllam is caught the first time(within a half hour of the films opening)there is not much of another place or twist they can add on or go to that would make this film more interesting.Bonham is just such a good tracker that finding his former student within a short time is inevitable,no matter where Hallam may want to go;which leaves no mystery there.Hallam is suffering from PTSD and we have certainly seen that in a myriad of movies over the years,so again nothing new.Secret government agencies and operations,cover ups,usurping of local authorities,again this is old hat and given the less than stellar direction and script it turns quickly into a bore.Del Toro and Jones are good in their respective roles but not good enough to overcome the many filmic stumbling blocks they are presented with on a constant basis.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r.Extras include four featurettes,deleted scenes and the trailer.<br />Overall a disappointing film with some good actors who have nowhere to go.It is passable,but just.2 1/2 - 3 stars.cks but in the end the outcome is inevitable.Bonham retires back to his home in BC,and is seen burning the letters Hallam had sent him long before.<br />Once Halllam is caught the first time(within a half hour of the films opening)there is not much of another place or twist they can add on or go to that would make this film more interesting.Bonham is just such a good tracker that finding his former student within a short time is inevitable,no matter where Hallam may want to go;which leaves no mystery there.Hallam is suffering from PTSD and we have certainly seen that in a myriad of movies over the years,so again nothing new.Secret government agencies and operations,cover ups,usurping of local authorities,again this is old hat and given the less than stellar direction and script it turns quickly into a bore.Del Toro and Jones are good in their respective roles but not good enough to overcome the many filmic stumbling blocks they are presented with on a constant basis.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r.Extras include four featurettes,deleted scenes and the trailer.<br />Overall a disappointing film with some good actors who have nowhere to go.It is passable,but just.2 1/2 - 3 stars.

B004SEUJKU|5.0|With a Blue-Ray movie you always need to keep in mind what you're working with. In this case it's a 30 year old movie with special effects that often times LOOK 30 YEARS OLD. Sorry, I'm a huge fun and they came out with an impressive product at the time, but not all the special effects hold up well.<br />What I'm grading this disc on though is the conversion to HD, which they do flawlessly. If you're a Terminator fan this is superb quality. Also, the Blue-Ray book is great packaging. It's actually a really cool feature for collectors to have. All in this is easily worth the money spent. Don't think twice!
0385534639|3.0|I struggle to say how I felt about this book. The world that Morgenstern created is wonderful. She clearly thought about the circus for a long time before she sat down to write. On the other hand, the plot and the development of the characters was pretty flat. It was incredibly boring for me. The pace, the characters, everything could have used a strong editorial hand. I felt that many characters were thrown in for page count, and detracted from the primary characters (who were pretty unlikeable).
0345803485|4.0|Okay, maybe I am ignorant, but I loved the books, all three. There are many punctuation errors. But I really enjoyed them. I could do without all of the sex, but I enjoyed the storyline. Its fictional people! I.E. not real. Don't read so much into it. I thought it was a great read. Especially for my first romance novel. I recommend it and have talked several friends into reading it who also enjoyed it.

B002ZG98C8|3.0|It's wildly exaggerated. It's supremely ridiculous. It spoofs its message. Huzzah! It's the action-packed motion picture, MACHETE, that you aren't supposed to take too seriously. It fulfills the promise raised in one of the faux trailers from the 2007 theater release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's double-billed GRINDHOUSE. A slew of big name actors graces this exercise in pseudo-exploitation cinema, but towering above them all is Danny Trejo as the brutish, laconic Machete Cortez, that vengeful ex-Federale. Trejo's face is so weathered it resembles a page out of a Thomas Guide. And yet he is somehow a chick magnet, if you buy into the film. No less than two hotties - Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba - throw themselves at him.<br /><br />When one sets foot on the vengeance trail, it's best to have a huge friggin' machete to wave around menacingly. Machete Cortez is an old school sort of hombre stalking a modern world. His impractical tool of choice is the machete, even though he frequently has access to less primitive weaponry. But he's very good with his namesake blade. He cuts a friggin' swath.<br /><br />For shucks and giggles Robert Rodriguez, early on, inserts grainy footage to emulate those trashy old 1970s flicks. This alerts us that there'll be plenty of tongue-in-cheek shenanigans going down. The plot, such as it is, concerns the hot button topic of illegal immigration. Robert DeNiro, who's stooping to everyone's level now, plays conniving senator John McLaughlin, an aw-shucks, unctuous and drawly gent who is up for re-election. He's standing fast with his platform of proudly crapping on illegal immigrants. Scorning the even playing field, he hatches a fiendish scheme to garner him even more votes.<br /><br />Three years after the murders of his wife and daughter, Machete Cortez has snuck across the border, assisted by an underground network. Today, disenchanted and without purpose, the ex-Federale struggles as a day laborer. And then, because misfortune is a cruel b!tch, Machete gets framed for an assassination attempt on Senator McLaughlin. Now a man on the run, can Machete Cortez muster up his dusty skills as a buttkicking investigator? More importantly, can he score a machete somewhere?<br /><br />Let me reiterate, MACHETE is not meant to be taken seriously. Not when Lindsey Lohan's sporting a nun's habit and Michelle Rodriguez is running a taco truck and Jessica Alba is supposed to be a tough-as-nails immigration officer. And certainly not when Steven Seagal is playing a ruthless, sword-wielding Mexican drug lord. And when Machete gets on the loose, the coordinator of the frame job places a call to 1-800-HITMAN. I won't even mention those scantily clad nurses toting automatic weapons.<br /><br />Rodriquez cheerfully constructs a mythology around Machete. He's got him plonked in the center of a brewing revolution. His past exploits are already legendary. It doesn't hurt Machete's street creds any that, in one jaw-dropping sequence, he... let's just say he tests a goon's intestinal fortitude. To quote one villain, Machete \\"looks like CIA, FBI, DEA, all rolled into one mean f------ burrito.\\"<br /><br />Performance-wise, the cast doesn't exactly cover itself in glory but I don't think it embarrasses itself, either. Besides, these characters are across-the-board over-the-top, which then gives us license to sit back and be more forgiving. Danny Trejo plays Machete just right, as a silent and implacable and sort of mysterious man of action. The humor is overt, perhaps to the detriment of narrative cohesion. But I really liked the riff on how everyone automatically admits a Mexican into their homes, providing he shows up with gardening tools. And Rodriguez's good luck charm and staple, Cheech Marin, is always worth a watch. MACHETE is a wild nudge in the ribs. It is packed with outrageous mayhem and cartoon violence. It even takes a semi-serious stab at a relevant issue, or relevant at least here on the left coast. And maybe on the U.S./Canadian border. I hear the Mounties are cracking down hard on any Yank trying to sneak across their border. Those health care benefits are so damn seductive.<br /><br />I guess MACHETE earned enough good will, because a sequel, MACHETE KILLS, has been greenlit and is already shooting. It looks to feature Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, and a reprising Michelle Rodriquez. There's a rumor circulating that Tony Jaa may even be in it, if he's done being a hermit in the woods. There's an eye towards a 2013 release. I'd Facebook Danny Trejo for confirmation, except we already know that \\"Machete don't text.\\"<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- 5 Deleted Scenes (totals 00:06:32 minutes and includes two scenes which features Sartana Rivera's twin)<br />- Watch MATCHETE with the Audience Reaction Track<br />- 2 MACHETE theatrical trailersft coast.

6303921248|5.0|This is by far one of my personal favorite films.  Not only do I own it but I have watched it over 35 times.  I love the character developement.  One of those films where you leap for joy and are filled with delight as the love grows between the two main characters.  Fantastic film, suitable for young audiences.  Classic romance at its finest.  Tastefully done.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Hunger games is one of those i cant put it down books!a sorry kids almost done will cook dinner soon book! it was brilliant and recomend it to anyone!
0061684384|5.0|A hardback book, thick pages, beautiful pictures. The best are the full body pics of Kat Von D's tattoos with explanations. I appreciate Kat after reading this. I have this and Tattoo Chronicles to add to my library.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was pretty disturbed by this book and find it very hard to understand what makes it so popular.  I suppose I am out of sync with those who are overtly morbid and have masochistic tendencies.  I find the love scenes to be quite the opposite of erotic, it actually left a sour taste in my mouth and left me pretty upset.  I hope that our younger generation is not drawn to this type of behaviour or ideology.  I would perhaps have enjoyed it more if the main character was a dry and hard business woman who needed to let go, but for the character to be an innocent young virgin really bothers me that her first sexual experiences would be so distorted and twisted and furthermore that people like the idea of this.  Something really wrong with this picture.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy to use.  The numbers and functions are large and easy to see.  The only thing that would make the app better would be sounds when the keys are tapped.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|pretty cool game. glad to finally get a game worth my time. g5 games are the best. graphics are good, storyline is ok. overall good game.
B004B32532|5.0|Alexander Jodorowsky is the most creative director alive. (I think he is still alive.) \\"EL TOPO\\" and \\"THE HOLY MOUNTAIN,\\" are the two films I had bought and enjoyed. This is the most creative talent in film making today. He is from South America and I doubt if he would want to make an American film. His visions on screen may disgust you, make you laugh, or wonder how he comes up with these films, that are unlike any you have seen.<br /><br />\\"SANTA SANGRE,\\" was an interesting trek with this film. I have never, never, seen a more creative director. I have two titles on Blu-Ray and will re-buy \\"El Topo\\" on Blu Ray too. Viewing these titles a second time, loses much because all the shock value has been shown at the first viewing. But, I introduce new people to watch it and they too become Alexander's fan. If you watch it over and over, you can still see scenes that show things you may have missed the first time around. I cannot praise these films any higher for the collector of DVDs.
B000JJ4PDK|1.0|The album itself is classic, 5 stars, hands down.  But, don't buy the remaster!<br /><br />A previous reviewer already noted that the MP3 version is edited; I can't comment on that.  What I can tell you is that, due to legal wrangling, some integral samples have been removed from this version, specifically from \\"Ready to Die,\\" \\"Machine Gun Funk,\\" and \\"Gimme the Loot.\\"  This definitely makes the remaster inferior.  Go find the original version at a used CD store.<br /><br />[Edit: Amazon removed my links to examples, but you can find the original and remastered versions of those tracks on YouTube and compare.]<br /><br />It's really too bad that whoever owns these tracks won't do the right thing!  It's not like Biggie's profiting from any of this anyway.
B006HL9G10|3.0|I'm changing my initial review which only gave it one star because it took forever for the app to appear on my Kindle.<br /><br />It is there now, but I find it to be glitchy to use.  The sounds are pretty.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|minor strategy involved. wish money drop and item drop was a little more abundant. over all great app no problems on maxx
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Lots of people I know highly recommended this game. On paper, how can it be bad? You play pictionary, except instead of drawing you build things out of LEGO.<br /><br />The problem is that the actual execution of the game has so many problems. The rules are incredibly vague, and it's pretty much up to the player to come up with a game that actually works. The examples they give you are very broken.<br /><br />Also, the cards they give you have pictures instead of words. This is very problematic. For example, there are many different cards with different kinds of boats on them. What if I draw the card with the container ship. I can just build any kind of boat and do I get a point when someone says boat, or do I have to get them to say cargo ship or container ship? The card only has a picture, so it is very ambiguous. It gets even worse when you realize there are three sailboats. This applies to the whole game.<br /><br />Creationary works best as a one player game. Randomly challenge yourself to build the different things out of LEGO to increase your construction skills. Playing it as a real competitive game to see who is best is an exercise in frustration.
0345803485|1.0|I wasn't going to read this book. I expected it to be a re-run of Exit to Eden. The trouble is, I did read it, and it was much worse than I expected!<br /><br />I agree with the negative reviews. Blushing, gasping, chewing her lips endlessly... that one made me wonder how much Chapstick she must go through... and climaxing at the mention of her name, the plot is totally ridiculous and unbelievable.<br /><br />As for Christian Grey being some sort of ultimate guy. Well, I guess I can't speak for everyone, but if some guy came off that way to me, he'd be fifty shades of red after I verbally tore him a new one. What a bizarre and unlikable character! Maybe if he were some sort of intellectually stimulating person, but all he seems to think about is how he can fly his freak flag. When does this 26 year old, self-made billionaire work??<br /><br />All I'm left with is wondering who thinks this is in any way a quality written book, even with low expectations of a fun summer fling sort of romance book. It is so desirous of style and intellect that it made me feel insulted after reading it. What may be even worse is that it's being eaten up by droves of people through, what I can only speculate, is a wildly successful marketing campaign.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip it. Or if you MUST read it, wait and borrow a copy, don't waste your money.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I love HO games and have played some by G5. It has a good storyline and you are able to move about finding objects easily.  Have not come across too many mini games yet. made it thru the third location with just a short time to play. Would have paid for it if it hadn't. been FAOD
B001B51B9M|5.0|The craft of filmmaking in the 50s was wildly different than it is today. Crews were smaller and cuts were less frequent. When I watch a 50s classic like Music Man, I am so impressed by how filmmaking success back then relied heavily on performance talent and script - after all, they didn't  use the manpower behind the craft like it's used these days to (too often) hide weak scripts and performances. Today, craft tends to outweigh content - which is fine, I suppose, but it's just enjoyable to watch a film like this and see another side of greatness in filmmaking :)<br /><br />Beautiful blu-ray transfer. Sounds great.
B0086700CM|5.0|quite possibly my favorite. great on Kindle Fire.<br />Super fun and addicting! totally recommended, plus it is FREE. have a hard time putting it down!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It's one of those games where you earn money and use it to buy yourself upgrades. I'm a big fan of games like this (Duck Life, for example). The main game is free and you can buy special upgrades with real cash. I'm perfectly fine with the free part. This game is awesome!
B007SGM084|5.0|With all the hype surrounding the content of this series, it was a pleasant surprise to find a story embedded in the books.  I was drawn obsessively to complete this series within days of purchase and I've reread each book at least 5 times!  It's not the most well-written, but the plight of these two characters makes for a compelling read.
B004UA8D1O|1.0|i did not purchase this video.it waspurchased by someone i do not even know.you say it was david roxburgh.i would like to sent it back but i do not know where to send it.thanx, ron wood
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was exactly what some other reviewers said.  So much sex, graphically described, became mundane.  I found myself skipping over some of it to get to the gist of the story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like the game because you earn money and then buy pets and a waterslide. And you earn a lot more coins to buy other things. You collect stars to go on to another level.<br />This game Rocks!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I love how it teaches you how to play tlyou the piano but it gives me X even though I accedently touched it. and the full version is like three dollors
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|omg best book  it maybe a little boring in the begginning but in the end i loved it go team peeta u rule lol f***u gale we all know ur bomb hit prim on purpose
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus was the first book I've ever purchased by a self-published author.  Since it was the Amazon customer reviews that convinced me to buy it, I figured I would add to the groundswell.  It's quite simply one of the best books I've ever read.  Each book in the Omnibus is a separate story but they blend together so well that it reads as one complete piece.  Hugh Howey deserves all the accolades he's been receiving...and more.  Very highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|1.0|this book was so boring zzzzzzzzzzzz  nap time how could this book beat the freaking hunger games series i mean really people this and the fifty shades of gray beat the hunger games
0345535421|5.0|A continuation of the saga begun in Game of Thrones with engaging characters, this well-paced story of feudal times in a far-off place pulls the reader in.  Competition for the rule of seven kingdoms has led to war and intrigue putting everyone from the lowliest villager to the highest royal in jeopardy.  The author describes all with evocative detail that makes this book a fun read, as the first one was.  George R.R. Martin has given the reader a sweeping and thoroughly imagined world, with maps included, that makes all readers citizens thereof.  The story is incomplete, though.  There is another volume yet to come.  In the meantime I'll just be honing my sword.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Its fun to see what will happen int the story but when your finding the items you notice a lot of the same ones so it pretty repetitive.
055358202X|4.0|In this fourth volume of A Song of Ice and Fire begun with volume one, A Game of Thrones, the author has us wondering and wandering with the characters as they vie for castles, seek safe havens and continue the wars and intrigues that will, hopefully, lead to peace in the country of Westeros among gods and men.  It is the men (and women!) who must decide.  Even seeking safety has its perils.  While Martin's writing is as compelling in this volume as in the previous three, I gave the book one less star as the story is somewhat more fragmented in this volume with new characters to focus on and less said about the ones readers have come to know.  While much of the saga has a Middle Ages sort of ring to it, we are reminded that this is a fictional land with the presence of giants, mammoths and the undead.  More so than in the last three volumes, this story feels very incomplete and another volume is eagerly anticipated.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|a lot of fun. hidden objects not too hard to find. would like instructions on how to play the mini games. does not freeze kindle fire like some games.
055357342X|5.0|The third \\"verse\\" of A Song of Ice and Fire continues the sweeping saga begun in Game of Thrones.  Wars rage to determine the ultimate ruler of Westeros, the country the author imagines and shares with his readers in vivid detail.  Elements of the story take place in every area of the country, the cold North, the warm South, and center on Kings Landing, the seat of the kingdom once unified under one king on the Iron Throne.  But now there are several contenders and they war and plot with one another for the ultimate prize.  Familiar characters perish, less familiar ones take a greater role in the tale, and the saga continues.  There is more to the story and another volume will pick up the tale.  I can't wait!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its really fun and challenging. I would reccomend temple run to those who also enjoy this. it reminds me of Mario except way better graphics.
B004KPLZKA|5.0|Cher Lloyd, X Factor finalist and pop starlet made an incredible pop record - hard to believe huh?. I say this because I clearly remember a bratty Cher bragging about 'haters' and random stuff right over the end of 2010, which left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />After a couple of months, she finally unleashed what would be her exquisite debut: 'Swagger Jagger'. The track oozed confidence and, fronted by a colourful image and catchy semi-hip hop beats mixed with heavy synths it definitely won my heart over and the UK's too - scoring herself a #1 smash hit on the back of it. 'With Ur Love', the album's -which was yet untitled back then- 2nd single was a creamy, pastel painted song that features US's Mike Posner, adding some extra flavour to it. Think a bump and grind background track with a carrousel tune and pulsating beats and there you have it - Cher, yet again, managed to captive the public whilts continuing her range of Top 5 hits with it. By this time, I was in complete love with that unnamed and soon to be released album. Gagging for it, her record company unleashed the rightly titled 'Sticks + Stones', addressing Cher's media criticisms and making some contrast with a playful, almost cartoony, album cover.<br /><br />I remember the day I first got the album in my hands, I was excited and I didn't know what to expect besides the already released singles and found out some true pop gems in this particular listening journey. By that time, I was going to graduate from Med school, so I highly associate the bittersweet undertones of the record with that particular time of my life. I put the record in my car and 'Grow Up' came up, a sizzling semi-rap with a playful tune which is easily hummable and memorable after the very first time you hear it. Busta makes a brief and whirlwind-esque appeareance but his presence takes it to a next level and leaves you wanting some more, even by this casual rap fan. One of the album's highlight 'Want U Back', the 3rd single andCher US' debut is bubblying up as Track 2 in 'Sticks + Stones'. It includes a catchy, fast handclap rhythm and a trademark 'Grrr' between all the verses - on top of that a stormer of a Chorus finding Cher beggind his ex lover to come back into her life because she's pretty jealous, ending altogether with our girl imitating an helicopter (random shizzle, but true fun is not easy to find nowadays in pop records). The 2 lead singles (Tracks 3 & 4) are followed by a guitar driven ballad coupled with Carolina Liar's feature - it is a bit slow and hard to swallow at first, especially considering the fast pace we had in the last couple of minutes - but when it sinks, it does fit inside the overall feeling of the album. Its very own highligh is Miss Lloyd's showcase of gorgeous vocals, that are commonly hidden by her for no particular reason.<br /><br />By this time, I was at the middle of listening to the album, thinking the highlights were already pointed out but, oh boy, I was wrong. The sixth track 'Playa Boi' (borrowing from Neneh Cherry's Buffalo Stance) is a synth heavy, battery fueled song. Fast, aggresive and bubbly at the same time, it has a metal sound going up and down all over the song and leaves you with the desire of pressing the 'repeat' button. I say 'leaves you', because Track 7 'Superhero', stops it clear from happening. 'Superhero' is a funky, semi 60's, strings and all included, delicious song where Lloyd screams she's not even her very own heroine to save her from the fraud her man is. The ending is hopeful and with a modest fading, making you to repeat the listening experience to hear her speak either about the brief love story spoken or her highly humour filled rap bridge (I kick you with a kung fu kick!). Track 8, the theme park sounding influenced 'Over the moon' is fluffy and easy on the ears, but it somehow falls into the category of faux-christmas song - maybe because of the time it was released or its playful carole-esque sounds. Track 9 is 'Dub on the track', Cher's take on the current move of dubstep and the collaboration between some of UK's most famous underground hip hop artists - it is quick and with a dirty electro semi-synth on the background, coupled with the aforementioned dubstep influences of the times. I arrived at Track 10 and thought 'Sticks + Stones' was a mish mash at best, but 'End Up Here' flicked my thoughts and rearranged the idea of the showcase of sounds this record is. Lloyd helped to pen up this gem, an RnB crafted ship of harmonies that speaks and sings with heartache about cheating in young relationships. The lyrics might be a bit näive for a girl of her age, but if you hear the sentiment behind the vocals, you'll get my drift. The midtempo tune double teams with the gorgeous melody soaring from start to end - that and those 'I don't want to shed a tear' attitude lyrics whilts she almost sounds like crying in the chorus' harmonies is going to sell the song to the hardest of the hearts. The CD stops spinning in my record player and starts all over, while sunset was setting on me and arriving home.<br /><br />Either I'm a bit biased (maybe is the feeling the album gave me through December of that year) or I was blinded by the Pop masterpieces created and performed by this little girl that gives everything she sings a bit of nostalgic factor. All I can say is, if you're willing to have some fun and sing along to some true well made Pop - this album is for you. Be sure to not miss out on this one.
B00723NWJE|2.0|I have been a passionate fan of Nora since her first album.  However, like many of her fans, I don't understand why she is going in this direction.  It just doesn't work for me.  She is best when she is in front of a piano and her God-given talents allow her to be the best in the world in my opinion.<br /><br />I paid good money to hear her perform at a concern in Nashville, TN on 6/25/12 and was very disappointed.  I like the Grateful Dead, but her voice does not work with that sound.  Her voice is just too powerful.  I did enjoy a few songs when the band stopped and allowed her to do her thing, but I was left wanting more.  I would not go to another one of her concerts with this band.<br /><br />I understand her desire to evolve as an artist, but I truly hope that the people around her can steer her in a better direction.  In my opinion, the sound of an electric guitar sounds like nothing but noise with her voice.  Nora - please use the talents that God gave you to do what you do best!  Nora - I encourage you to try something new, but please don't settle with this sound/band.  You can do so much better!

B0088XXCZ6|4.0|Fiona Apple has put out some really well thought out music in the past. I own her last three albums. The new one is different, which is good. I wouldn't want the same album done over and over again. I wont buy the album all at once. like to download a few songs and get the feel of the cd. This one will take some time to grow on me, but it will. Fiona Apple is a true artist, check out some of the other songs in the last few years. The songs So Sleepy, Send me somebody to love, Father and son with Johnny Cash. The new record has its own feel or mood for the times when you may need it. Fiona Apple thank you for your music.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this on my iPhone 4S for about 8 months and love it. Since then my phone has fallen a few times from upto around chest high and there's not a single scratch or ding on my phone even though its fallen on some concrete surfaces. The semi hard flexible material definitely absorbs shocks, the front edges are raised and the back is all protected. So unless you drop it on pointy large gravel, a small fall on a flat surface will result in NO damage to your phone.<br /><br />The screen film protector that comes with it is awesome. I managed to apply mine in one try (very lucky) and there is not a single bubble of trapped air, not ONE! I think its because of the film material, that's a perfect mating with the iPhone Corning glass screen.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this a 10!

B007N85ZXY|5.0|I am totally mystified by all the negative reviews this album has gotten. I heard \\"Oh Susanna\\" on a local radio station weeks before the official release date, and I was instantly hooked. This is VINTAGE Crazy Horse! Sloppy, repetitive, ragged and loud... AND I LOVE IT! Cannot stop playing these twisted renditions of songs we all learned in grade school.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Had not heard of Wool or Hugh Howey until I bought my Kindle a couple of weeks ago. After reading it, I'm glad I got the Kindle, became aware of this series and read books 1-5. Now that I am done, I hope that the series isn't finished and that books 6-10 are published soon...and I will start looking at other Hugh Howey books as soon as I finish this review. The characters, the story, the writing...everything worked. It's terrific. Don't understand why it isn't better known and higher ranked on the best seller lists. Started as a short story and reader demand for more has turned the short story into 5 short books. And I don't see why there shouldn't be many more installments to follow. Get it. Read it. I think you'll be glad you did. I know I am.[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]

0062183591|4.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00IGKZRCW An Executive Summary of Dan Ariely's 'The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone--Especially Ourselves']]<br /><br />The main argument: There is certainly no shortage of lying, cheating and corruption in our society today. At their worst, these phenomena do substantial damage to our communities and the people in them.  Picking on the corporate world for just a moment, consider a few high-profile examples from the last decade: the scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, Haliburton, Kmart, Tyco, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and a host of banks in the financial crisis of 2008.<br /><br />If you are a particularly pessimistic person, you may think that people are fundamentally self-interested, and will engage in dishonest and corrupt behaviour so long as the potential benefits of this behaviour outweigh the possibility of being caught multiplied by the punishment involved (known as the Simple Model of Rational Crime or SMORC). On the other hand, if you are a particularly optimistic person, you may think that the lying and cheating that we see in our society is largely the result of a few bad apples in the bunch.<br /><br />Given that the way we attempt to curb cheating and corruption depends largely on which view we think is correct, we would do well if we could come up with a proper understanding of these tendencies, and under what circumstances they are either heightened or diminished. Over the past several years, the behavioral economist Dan Ariely, together with a few colleagues, has attempted to do just this--by way of bringing dishonesty into the science lab. Ariely reveals his findings in his new book, The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone--Especially Ourselves.<br /><br />In order to get at the truth, Ariely invited subjects into his lab and gave them tasks with monetary rewards, where cheating was a very real and clear possibility. As you can tell from the title of the book, Ariely found that cheating was not confined to a few bad apples, but was in fact very widespread. On the bright side, though, Ariely also found that the vast majority of his subjects did not cheat nearly as much as they could have, but instead confined themselves to just a little bit of cheating.<br /><br />Given his findings, Ariely concludes that most of us are torn between two conflicting impulses. On the one hand is the desire to get ahead by way of dishonesty, and on the other hand is the desire to nevertheless think of ourselves as genuinely honest and good people. Getting the best of the both worlds can be tricky, but we manage to do so by way of resorting to our trusty capacities of rationalization and self-deception. Of course, different people show different powers of rationalization and self-deception, and also different circumstances can alter the terms of the negotiation significantly for each of us, thus leading to more or less cheating.<br /><br />For instance, Ariely found that those who are especially creative are particularly good at rationalization and self-deception, and therefore tend to cheat more so than others (in fact, Ariely found that even priming normal subjects with words related to creativity can increase their cheating behaviour). In addition, he also found that several factors influence the amount that people cheat in general. These factors included being reminded of one's morals; playing for tokens representing money, as opposed to money itself; having one's resolve broken down by will-power depletion; wearing counterfeit clothing and merchandise (as opposed to the genuine article); having one's self-confidence artificially inflated; witnessing other people cheating (either from one's own in-groups, or from out-groups); cheating to benefit others etc.<br /><br />While these findings are interesting in their own right, Ariely insists that they also have practical value, as he uses his findingsto chart out suggestions with regards to how we can minimize cheating and corruption in our own lives, as well as in society at large.<br /><br />Ariely's clever lab experiments yield many interesting findings with regards to dishonesty, and he tells about them in a very easy and relatable way in his book. My only real criticism is that Ariely does not get into the evolutionary story about the conflicting desires that he identifies, and how and why they may have been laid down in our evolutionary past. Though such a story is not absolutely essential here (as the research does stand on its own), it would add substantially to our understanding of the subject (and is interesting in its own right), and would therefore by very worthwhile.

B0071LLHGC|5.0|AWESOME Golden Nugget of the Allmans !! Where has this recording been hiding over the last 40 years ?? Bought this not expecting too much, despite the good reviews shown here(I thought Ludlow Garage was an letdown recording due to static!) ... but this recording is CLEAR AS A BELL !! GREGS voice is on !! DUANE is in his legendary creative form !! This recording is RAW (in a good sense, like you are in the room ) , and in a very rare almost intimate setting , there is some real dialogue going on between some songs (Duane talks about King Curtis in the Soul Serenade set intro )..This concert was  a month or so I guess after the historic Fillmore east album, shortly before Duanes death ... no Tom Doucett on Harp like at Fillmore or 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival (another favorite of mine) ,but a GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY !! Great LISTENING and cant believe the price !! (Received within a week of ordering thru normal shipping - huge surprise)<br /><br />(Update - Dec 5, 2012 - I notice that the price has unfortunately DOUBLED to $26 for this CD (I bought it half that 6 some odd months ago), no doubt that the TROLLS that are giving this AWESOME RECORDING ONE Star are not affecting the marketplace with their BS)

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was not my least favorite book, but definitely not one I would read again.  The characters did not draw me in or make me feel any sense of connection in any way. I felt it dragged on and on. The way Ana was so sheltered and naive was unbelievable. The way Christian Grey was this \\"broken\\" man who didn't know how to love was very cliche.<br /><br />I didn't like it. I had to force myself to read it and only because it was our monthly book club pick did I do that.<br /><br />The hype surrounding this book is crazy. Certainly didn't live up to what I expected.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|so excited to have this book on the kindle for my phone. i just saw the movie so i am really looking forward to finishing the book at this point. happy reading!
0345803485|3.0|At first I couldn't put the book down. It is mommy porn but it is tasteful. I just wasn't convinced to proceed to the 2nd and 3rd book after. The sexual encounters are interesting at first, but then they become \\"oh another sex scene\\" and you get past it. It was ok.
0345803485|3.0|I didn't think it lived up to the hype.  The erotica part is fine but the plot is very slim and the main character didn't do a think for me.

1419702238|4.0|By Chang Mai, age 9, 3rd March 2012.<br /><br />This book is set in a town in America. It takes place in a school, in people's homes, in church and lots of other locations. Greg Heffley is the main character. He is the `wimpy kid', which means he is always in the wrong spot at the wrong time, and he gets into trouble. Greg can't seem to avoid sticky situations and he's never lucky. When he tries to make something better it just becomes worse. In this book Greg's main problem is that he gets stuck in his house because of a snowdrift. He is trapped inside with Manny, his irritating younger brother, and Roderick, his bullying older brother, for a month or more! His Mum is there too but she doesn't really help.<br /><br />Other characters in the book include Rowley, Greg's best friend, his Dad, and his relatives who visit for Christmas.<br />Greg runs into problems throughout the book, like when he is surprisingly made student of the week and he is given a bumper sticker saying \\"My child is student of the week!\\" Greg asks if he could put it on his dad's new car but he would not allow Greg to stick it anywhere near his flashy car. So then Greg asks his mum but she said her bumper was too full already. He gave it to Manny to stick it on his tricycle, but, instead Manny sticks it slap bang in the middle of dad's new car. Greg needs to remove it quick before his dad finds out, but silly Greg, he uses steel cotton pads to scrub the sticker off. He also scrubs off the bird poo. When he is finished Greg has a real shock to see that the pads took off the paint as well!<br />I think this book is for people who like easy to read, funny stories. We feel sorry for Greg because even though he's so pathetic we all can be like that sometimes!<br /><br />I recommend this book for kids who like to read comics and humorous stories. It will help pass time and make you feel better about your own problems!

I'm so glad to see they aren't out of stock as I need to get more before they run out!

B005HV6Y84|4.0|Soundtrack CDs can be a mixed bag, and \\"Breaking Dawn - Part 1\\" is no exception.  I did find two tracks I love by bands I didn't previously know.  From Tennessee, The Features' \\"From Now On\\" is a rocking love song with a pounding beat and vocals that go from the earthy to the airy, \\"Dreamed last night about a time & place where from our troubles we had escaped, I held your hand & I felt complete.\\"  It's an absolute delight.  The brother & sister band, The Belle Brigade, also deliver a delightful punch with \\"I Didn't Mean It.\\"  The track begins with a pounding piano and a wild vocal that sounds like vocalist Barbara Gruska is half out of her head, \\"I drove a nail in the bottom of my walking boot so I worry every time I hit the floor, I'm dragging & I'm bleeding, I'm begging & I'm pleading cause I thought you had another & you cannot have another lover.\\"  It's such an emotional thunderbolt that I can't stop listening.  Other tracks like Bruno Mars' \\"It Will Rain\\" & Iron & Wine's \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" are also strong.  Enjoy!
B001E45XT4|1.0|the sound is pretty good...<br /><br />but these are very uncomfortable to wear.. you cannot wear them for more than an hour..<br /><br />they doesnt enclose your ears.. they are one your ears..
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Australian rocker Gotye's \\"Making Mirrors\\" is a great CD.  This is one I got from my daughter for my birthday; and I appreciate her taste.  The breezy \\"Easy Way Out\\" brings back the two-minute song with a killer riff on which Gotye's airy vocals hang, \\"Wearing me out (all this), Hanging around (It just starts), Getting me down ('til I'm just) looking for an easy way out.\\"  It slams right into the monster hit \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" with its insouciant beat that belies the breakup lyric and Gotye's soaring vocals rushing headlong from hushed to the full voiced chorus, \\"But you didn't have to cut me off.\\"  \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" throbs with pounding drums and perhaps is an environmentalist song, \\"But it was like to stop consuming is to stop being human.\\"  \\"I Feel Better\\" delights as an emotionally upbeat anthem.  Other tracks on the CD range from the atmospheric opening title track to vocal experiments.  For me, the variety makes the strong hook-filled tunes stand out all the more.  This is musically catchy, lyrically intriguing and stunningly performed.  Enjoy!
B0058BIHXI|5.0|Our whole family loves this hilarious ensemble comedy show.<br /><br />Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills.

B005LAIHYU|2.0|Before I state anything, you must understand that I was not expecting much from this movie. I'm fully aware that movies of this nature are not meant to be taken seriously and as such, I went into this film purely for the entertainment value. It's just unfortunate that this movie was just middle of the road mediocre.<br /><br />There's some good to this film, mostly in the form of the underused secondary characters and the underdeveloped world of the vampires. I couldn't help but love some of the familiar faces I saw in this, such as Alan Tudyk (Alpha from Dollhouse), and I really wanted to see more of them. I also liked the character of Speed, who was woefully underused. Rufus Sewell does his best to appear somewhat menacing, and is generally the most interesting of the more main characters. I admit, at times I was rooting for him just because he actually had more of a personality than Lincoln did. (And Dominic Cooper well... he made for some awesome eye candy.)<br /><br />The bad is that this film is overly long. It's barely two hours long, but felt like three. There's just long periods of time where the plot just sags and is bogged down by its own weight. The cinematography was nice enough and the 3D was well shot, but if you're looking to see this in 3D, save your money. It's not worth the extra dollars. Other than the occasional fight or special effects-laden scene, most of the film really didn't require 3D and made it more of a gimmick than an asset. I don't mind 3D gimmicks, but considering how expensive 3D can be it's not really worth it.<br /><br />I can't say that this is the worst film ever made. It has parts that redeem it and if it was bad then that would have actually made it that much more entertaining. I think that the filmmakers intended this to have an Ed Wood meets Rocky Horror meets schlockly vampire cinema feel to it, but this just comes across as solidly bland fare. It's not something that I'd tell people never to see, but it is something I'd recommend waiting for the DVD to hit shelves before seeing.<br /><br />Seriously, wait for the DVD and the inevitable RiffTrax soundtrack to synch up with it. I'm pretty sure that this the DVD/Blu-Ray will have some nice features on it and a RedBox rental would be far cheaper. (Hint to the movie people: pay the RiffTrax people to create an audio track for your DVD and release it as an official feature on the DVD. Now that I'd pay additional money to see/hear.)commend waiting for the DVD to hit shelves before seeing.<br /><br />Seriously, wait for the DVD and the inevitable RiffTrax soundtrack to synch up with it.

B0086700CM|4.0|I've been waiting for Temple Run to be available to the Kindle. A basic synopsis of the game:<br />The character you play has stolen an idol from a temple. Now he's being chased by these mutant-monkey things. You have to swipe your finger up to jump over tree trunks and gaps in the path, swipe your finger down to duck under flaming arches, and swipe it to the side to turn when the path changes directions. How to play is pretty simple, but the game can be challenging. Your goal is to run as far as you can without dying (you die when you hit a tree, run off the edge of a path, or are caught up to by the monkeys). You also collect coins which you can use to buy new characters, extra lives, etc.

B004132HZS|5.0|Messing with a legend can be dangerous for television producers, particularly one so familiar to audiences in the UK and and US.  However, the producers of \\"Sherlock\\" have pulled it off, reimagining iconic detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Doctor Watson into 21st Century London while retaining the essentials of the characters and their adventures together.  This is good stuff.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is Sherlock Holmes, brillant but ideosyncratic consulting detective to New Scotland Yard's harried Inspector Lestrade (a well-cast Rupert Graves).  Holmes is joined in the first episode by Doctor John Watson, late of the British Army in Afghanistan, and well-played by Martin Freeman.  Cumberbatch and Freeman have the look and feel of a good on-screen partnership as Holmes and Watson.  The dialogue in the episodes is peppered with conversations and references from the originial stories that fans will recognize, while the episodes find various ways to depict Holmes' amazing ability for deduction, including on screen graphics.<br /><br />Season One has three episodes.  One is an updated version of \\"A Study in Scarlett\\", in which our heroes meet.  A second case involves a mysterious assassin roaming London, leaving clues in code.  The third case matches Sherlock against his traditional adversary, Moriarty, in a cliff-hanger that begs for a second season (fortunately, there is one).  This DVD set also includes a featurette on the making of the series.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock\\" is very highly recommended to fans of the Sherlock Holmes genre, especially those who enjoyed the 1940's Basil Rathbone incarnation, also filmed in the present tense.  These 90 minute episodes move quickly and offer good entertainment while retaining the essentials of the original stories.

B007R4ZNWW|5.0|Being an Almodovar fan since the early 90's, and owning all his films, I eagerly awaited the release of his lastest movie. It was  DEFINITELY worth the wait. Without giving anything away, the plot of this film, as well as the overall topic he addresses is quite exceptional.<br />ANYONE who is a fan, or for those who have only heard about Amodovar, this is a MUST SEE!!!

0393072231|5.0|This book is an engagingly written tale about a motley group of investors whom arrived, largely independently, at similar conclusions. If you anticipate a deep look at the causes of the financial crisis, then you have purchased unwisely. Balance of payments dynamics are ignored in favor of abrasive personalities, a glass eye, and daring bets. Characters drive the story, and they provide timeless tales of investor psychology, and the pressures of being really, really right, alone.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn's third release, GONE GIRL, was quite different from her first two books.  It's the day of a couple's fifth wedding anniversary but there is a problem.  This book tells the story in alternating chapters between the man and woman.  It was a unique book and very different from her other books.  Overall, I enjoyed the book but would like to see her go back to the darkness that she successfully achieved with SHARP OBJECTS and DARK PLACES.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's remains one of my favorite, recommended, must-read authors so I can't wait for her next one!

B007I2BZIE|4.0|The Rush of 2112 is back, the band of Moving Pictures, the conceptual maestros of concept albums; their 20th studio album and they sound as ferocious and powerful as ever. \\"Clockwork Angles\\" is Neil Peart's musing on faith and hope in the time of tragedy (and is allegedly inspired by the work of 17th century French philosopher Voltaire's Candide). Having lost his wife and daughter, then his drum mentor, Peart took a journey into the wilderness and came back with the seeds of what is this album. As he intones on the opener, \\"I can't stop thinking big.\\"<br /><br />That alone should tell you you're in for a near classic Rush CD. The band (or at least the central character in the upcoming novelization of the album) is traveling through time and making sense of the chaos surrounding him. He meets up with \\"The Anarchist,\\" in a seven minute all-the-stunts prog-rocker and the \\"Carnies,\\" who pound the drums between the 'flint and steel and games of chance.\\" The bass-work here alone will melt your lasers.<br /><br />Then there are the songs that are trademark rush, like the opening \\"Caravan\\" that starts our journey and \\"Headlong Flight,\\" which propel you through the plot with reckless efficiency. \\"I wish I could live it all again\\" screams Geddy Lee (in fine voice), as he defies the clockmaker to make him downtrodden about the curves life has thrown his way and the rest of the band is pulsing with muscle right in their behind him. Or the eff-off of \\"Wish Them Well,\\" as Lee tells us to ignore the cynics and make peace with what life has for you.<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a dense and powerful album, and given the long-in-toothiness of the band, Rush are still staking out territory few contemporaries can even dip their toes in. Maybe Peart measures out a life that goes \\"from bad to worse\\" (BU2B), but he is still optimally a heartbeat in a band that plays by its own set of rules and seems to find ways to make time stand still for their fans, and for their own sense of optimism.ism.

B00005QW5X|5.0|...You are going to love \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\". It is delightful, funny and at time poignant with a fantastic musical score wrapped around it. Originally an off broadway play created by and starred John Cameron Mitchell who then made into a movie. It is about a transsexual rock and roll singer from East Berlin who comes to the United States to find her fame and fortune. Along the way she meets a young man that she helps develope into a big time rock singer who then leaves her stealing her songs and taking credit for them in the process. The movie has hilarious moments along side touching moments as well as Hedwig as a new woman in a new country tries to understand her place in the world. It is a feeling that all of us, not just transgendered individuals, have felt at some point in out lives. That is where I think \\"Hedwig\\" is a better movie then \\"Rocky Horror\\". Not that I don't like \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" because I definately do. \\"Rocky Horror\\" rates as one of the greatest cult movies of all time. But \\"Hedwig\\" deals with emotions and situations that can bring the movie to a more personal experience for the viewer again whether the viewer is transgendered or not.<br /><br />The acting in the film is first rate as well as the directing. The storytelling is clever as well with the use of animation at various points to help tell the story. Throw in the fact that the soundtrack is amazing with some kick@$$ songs just helps to make the experience of watching \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" all the more enjoyable to watch. In fact if you find in watching \\"Hedwig\\" that you love the music, as well as the movie, as much as I do then you need to get yourself the soundtrack album. While in the movie you get just snippets of some of the songs from the film, the soundtrack album plays all the songs in their entirerty. That is important since the songs themselves also play an important part in helping to tell the story. All in all a great movie plus a great soundtrack makes for great entertainment!for great entertainment!

B007MDB71O|5.0|If you ignore its source material, John Carter in itself is an incredible movie, sci-fi or otherwise. The story is very intriguing; more so, dare I say, than the book. As for inaccuracies between it and the book: there are many, but several of these changes help make the movie that much better. The characters are likeable and offer entertaining lines at every turn. The special effects provide plenty of eye candy, and the music is enthralling. All in all, every aspect of this film blends well together, which is very hard to come by these days. It is a pity that there will probably not be a sequel; sorry, Gods of Mars, you may have to wait. I encourage anyone who likes sci-fi, adventure, or action to either buy this film (in the hopes that it will be able to earn enough to make up for its losses at the box office) or at the very least watch it; you will not be sorry you did.

B003TO5414|5.0|Exceptionally brilliant and fast-paced series that shows a true-to-form rendition of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson in modern day London.  Following the classic stories with a twist of current affairs.  Witty, snappy repartee' and a look at the workings of Sherlocks mind from the viewpoint of someone with Asperger Syndrome.  It is alluded to but not focused on and it makes for much more depth of character and understanding.

0375869026|5.0|I MISS MY AUGGIE!!!!! I was so sad when I finished this book, which I did in a day and a half (would have been a day but my kids kept demanding food and attention....go figure :). I fell in love with each and every character and  really enjoyed how the author gave the story from the others point of view at times, which I think kept things very fresh and interesting.  I tell you what, I will be following Ms. palicio! I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.  I just passed the book over to my 15yr old daughter, and after that my 17yr old son wants it.  I can't wait until my 4yr old twins are a little older, because I will be reading it to them! I know I'm rambling, but I'm still feeling a bit giddy and a bit sad as I JUST finished reading it....I even read the acknowledgments which I hardly ever do, and I enjoyed them! She's a wonderful writer, and her personality shines through in every line.<br />Thank you so much Ms. Palicio for  such a wonderfully funny, touching, thought provoking, story.<br /><br />My advice: read this to your kids, it truly may make a difference in who they are/will become as far as empathy goes, I know it has for me, forever!

B008COII1Y|1.0|The movie started out okay then got very confusing, boring and the directing was very bad...this movie was not scary, not a thriller or action movie or even a drama.  It was a bad Z movie (yes does not even make it to be a bad B movie, so I used the last letter to describe how poor it is!).
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|Robin Hobb is an enormously under-rated writer and I am a huge fan.  This last book very nicely brought a finish to the 6 Farseer novels and as ever with Robin Hobb I found myself resenting the interuptions of real life to my enjoyment of her World.<br /><br />I highly recommend all 6 in this series, plus the adjacent and related Rain Wild River series.

0345803485|1.0|Like most people I was brainwashed into getting this book because everyone said how good it was.  I wish I had read the reviews before doing so because this book is complete rubbish!!!!!  The characters are so underdeveloped that I couldn't relate to them.  Christian sounds like he is 100 years old rather than a man in his 20's.  Anastasia sounds like a blubbering teenager from the 50's.  I don't know how many times she had to bite her bottom lip and for stupid Christian to find it irresistable; how many times her inner self (or whatever she called it) had to be mentioned; and how many times their breaths had to hitch.  It's amazing how Anastasia is so upset and concerned with what \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" did to Christian but yet she has no problems with him doing the same things to her. In addition, the constant nonsense emails that were sent were so boring and dumb. All the author did was consult a thesaurus to write this book.  She should've enlisted the help of decent authors instead!  Oh and by the way, what kind of erotica book describes a person's sexual organ as \\"down there?\\"  And for such a rich guy he should have had a more diverse wardrobe.  Utterly stupid!!!!

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I ordered and received the movie, \\"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\\" and watched over the weekend.  However, I noticed a few scenes in the movie were either \\"edited\\" or simply \\"cut\\" .  I am asking AMAZON to kindly advise if this was the \\"original\\" theatre version ordered.  If not, then this particular version has certainly been edited or someone tampered with the movie and deleted scenes from it.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts. Yes, I saw the movie in its entirety and scenes were missing.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Denise Torres-Vazquez
B004LROMQG|4.0|I liked seasons 1 & 2 because I am interested in the Merlin/Arthur tales, but I wasn't sold on them because they were definitely NOT in the style of the Once and Future King. Lots of things were changed without good reason and without improving upon the story. A year has passed since I saw those. I have also been to a couple of the spots where they did some filming for season 3 (Ragland Castle & Puzzlewood). I think both of those things helped to prepare me to appreciate season 3 more... and I did.<br /><br />In the second season, I felt like the writers were playing up the teen idol, sex appeal, bad as* quality of the characters. As a mature person, I didn't see any of them in that light, so that was a complete turn off. This season has more of a grown up, serious, and even dark at times, feel to it. I like that.<br /><br />I didn't like Bradley James (Arthur) at first, but I find that he's the perfect actor to play this character as he's now being written. His expressions and actions feel genuine. However, I am glad that he has less screen time and Merlin isn't just being shown through his interactions with Arthur.<br /><br />Katie McGrath (Morgana) is the weak link. I think the writers have made her flat and uninteresting... or at least that is how she's being played. She has the same dumb smirk on throughout season 3. You really have to suspend reality to believe that nobody is on to her switch in loyalties.<br /><br />Guinevere doesn't have much to do. That's fine with me. She's not that interesting either. The chemistry between her and Arthur is nonexistent.<br /><br />Colin Morgan (Merlin) has come into his own. His part is richer and his acting is better. You can see the maturity in his character. He is becoming more willful and wise. It makes for a much more interesting story. And since the series is called MERLIN, what could be more appropriate?<br /><br />So, it's still not the Once and Future King, but it's a fun filled fantasy that all ages can enjoy. It's got magic, dragons, wizards, legends, and good triumphing over evil. I will probably buy this season and will look forward to season 4.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I started this book I thought OH MY, but ther farther I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happens next.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|When I heard that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows would be split into different movies I was very disappointed. I had felt that making the movie into two parts was just a way to make even more money off the series and was just stupid. After seeing both movies my opinion really changed!<br /> HPDH1 is one of my favorite Harry Potter movies. I loved how this movie didn't center on Hogwarts as the other movies did. Part 1 follows Harry, Ron, and Hermoine as they travel to find the final horcruxes. There was alot of drama and tension in this movie compared to the previous 6 movies. I felt that the acting in this movie as well as the special effects were superb. If you liked the books or movies you'll love this movie!

1452105111|5.0|This set comes with an amazing amount and assortment of letters.  You can practically spell anything.  I used this for my daughter's Hungry Caterpillar themed first birthday and spelled out HAPPY FIRST BIRTHDAY ISABELLA.  I put a different animal picture in between each word and one on each end.  The ribbon included is really long and holds the letters perfectly in place like magic.  There was absolutely no slipping.  This banner took up an entire wall and was definitely a hit.  I got so many compliments on it and so many people asked me where I got it (to which I replied, Amazon of course).<br /><br />This was a very cute and versatile decoration.  This could easily be used for many other themes, not just hungry caterpillar or Eric Carle because of all the different colors the letters come in.  And the box they come in is very sturdy and is the perfect way to store them for many future parties.  It was an absolute steal!

B005UBNKZG|5.0|This processor is great. i dont play many high end games so benchmarks dont matter much to me. probably the heaviest game i play is either wow on max or mw3 on max. i have yet to try any real high end games as im still in the process of building my rig but will update my review when done so. packaging was great. no bent pins and as with any cpu very easy to install. i would definately reccomend using an aftermarket cpu cooler though. the one that was included with this one didnt even have the thermal grease on right...it was applied crooked so i didnt even bother not to mention the stock cooler is very ugly and from what i hear its barely enough to get the cpu through simple web browsing so i will be going with a coolermaster v10 for this cpu. i just reccomend to everyone that you upgrade bios and install patches as needed. otherwise you are going to be very disappointed in this cpu.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|The ads are a single splash screen and nothing more. The game play is fun and interesting. I like Manning and this game puts a different twist on it.
0307730697|5.0|This is a book every citizen should read regarding the sacrifices of our men and women who serve this Country. Adam was not only a true warrior and hero as a Seal Team 6 member, but was also a real man that wanted his story told flaws and all. It is an inspirational book that I have given out to over 20 people since reading it when it came out in May. If you are looking for a true insirational book that will lift your soul and belief in God and this Country.... this is the book!

B00499K9E0|5.0|Every episode of this new Sherlock is well done and great entertainment. I think I have seen or read almost all of the Sherlock movies/tv/books. If you are a fan like I am, you will love the clever rework of the original Holmes stories -- half the fun is noticing the modern interpretation of the classic characterizations and plots. While the actor portraying Sherlock is brilliant, my favorite parts have to be the portrayal of Watson and Mrs. Hudson. Both characters are thoroughly modern characters, but so much more like what I envisioned them to be like from the original stories. the only complaint is simply not more episodes fast enough!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Does pretty much everything you ask for in a note app. Very intuitive go use. No wrong way to use it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The story is written in such a way that one will be able to sympathize with the feelings of Charlie. As the events unfold in his life, one will realize that in one way or another we also experience similar situations in our own lives. Being able to relate as intensely to a story as I did in this novel is rare for me so I have to commend the author for doing such a great job! This book got into my nerves.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was way better than I had thought it would be. A very good story with good graphics and CGI, along with good acting all around as well, I was pleasantly entertained. 5-stars from me.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|Not my kind of book,  Character was too self involved.  Couldn't relate to character or her life style.  How many people can break away and travel for that long: very few I expect.  All she talked was about herself.  I rather hear about the places and the people more.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved this book! It was filled with action, adventure, mystery, and was filled with lots of twists and turns. Read it!
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Never a dull moment in this movie! I've never seen the TV show but the movie is ridiculously funny and if I ever once wasn't laughing it was a nice break from laughing so much and so hard! Whoever thinks this movie sucks has ZERO sense of humor because it was great! I saw it twice in the theater and I never see movies twice in the theater at least.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This item is exactly as described in the Amazon video about the product.  The Kindle Fire fits snugly into the cover, has a nice sleek design and protects the device screen nicely.  So far I am very happy with the design and quality of the cover.  Update...have had the case for several weeks and find it right up to snuff.  Several folks have commented on the quality and fit of the case.  I'm very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to others.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|As far as the free app amazon promotes this one is a superior one. it is fun and easy and worth the download. As far as a paid app goes, yeah, after seeing it in action, its worth it too. And what's great about a free app for the dev? That I am now interested in the games they come out with. works great on my fire too, 5 big stars.

1451608659|5.0|This book is awesome. The rules fore creating an Olympic team of any other sport are not controlled by one person, as in current women's gymnastics in the USA. I closely followed all competitions since 1992. this book is a good eye opener to the real life of some gymnasts who are not treated well and have a tough life in the sport. Dominique is a very strong person and endured a lot more than I knew when I watched her at the 1996 games. well worth reading, real and well edited also.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a very realistic ending for this series.  After reading all the negative comments I almost didn't read the final story.  Just goes to show that we need to do our own thing and not read everyone else's evaluations. No, this wasn't a Disney ending, and it wouldn't have been very realistic if it was. Overall a very fine science fiction adventure in a land that I'm glad I'm NOT in!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|read this book but couldn't figure out what all the hype was about.  I actually found it boring and quite unbelievable.  would not purchase books 2 and 3.
B001LM1456|2.0|The first two thirds of the movie are more like an unimaginative action flick than a superhero movie. A lot of these scenes are devoted to establishing the back story, which they somehow manage to do poorly. Tim Roth is top-notch for a lot of roles, but his casting as a menacing antisuperhero in this movie must be some sad joke on both him and the audience. The final battle will appeal to both non-discriminating special effects fans and those who religiously TiVo WWE Smackdown.<br /><br />The heavy use of the color green adds an occasionally welcome dollop of camp, however.<br /><br />,Wil
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|great way to waste some time. I got it as the free app of the day and it was worth it!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Starting off, this is an amazing movie in it's own rights. Its almost like that above-standard action-thriller that comes along once in a while. As a comic book movie, not so much. I know it's unfair to compare this to Tim Burton's 1989 classic but what other live-action films contain both the Joker and Batman (Excluding the 1966 campfest). In this movie, Batman really just seems like a playboy with too much time on his hands, and then decides to fight crime do some strange sense of Self-righteousness, you would think he would he would become an accomplished lawyer who gets criminals off the street or something, but a superhero is a little far-fetched. The world isn't really atmostpheric like Tim Burton's or as stylish, but not everyone can be Tim Burton I guess. Deppressing grittiness and bleakness plague this film, and it works but sometimes the grittiness is overdone and comes out looking rather too depressing, but this is a really well done film with spot-on editing (unlike Batman Begins)<br />And now the moment we're all waiting for ........... The Joker! I'll say, Heath Ledger's performance deserved every award he was nominated for and like the 1989 Batman, The Joker steals the show. And also like the 1989 Batman, the joker overshadows the caped crusader. In this one he seems like an man who lost his job and his family died, then just snapped. Although it's not really explained, although he does provide 2 possible explanations for his insanity, unlike the 1989 classic in which we see how he becomes insane. This doesn't really help you relate to the character as he is just an insane character who does things becomes he wants to.<br />Christian Bale was very good as Batman, but nowhere as badass or suave as Michael Keaton but he does the best with what he's given. Not really much to say.<br />So Great blu-ray, amazing movie in its own rights, so-so comic book movie.
B001TK8TJO|5.0|I ordered more than one used copy of The 5 LOVE LANGUAGES from Amazon. All arrived in short time and were in even better condition than as sellers represented. Clean enough to offer as gifts. This book is a MUST for any newlyweds as well as us old married people so we can easily \\"figure out\\" our spouse, know what needs to be done to truly understand how the other wants love, gives love, and interprets our love. All based on 5 basic types of individuals we are, judging love by which of the 5 \\"love languages\\" we use. Excellent book. Will order more copies as need arises, like as a wedding gift, or to any couple seeking a successful long-term relationship, or for a single person seeking understanding of what they want in a solid relationship. Good for home-based marriage therapy as it is easily digested by a couple working thru the book together. The edition that has the quiz at the end which helps each person prioritize their own love languages, is particularly helpful.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this for years!! I literally have worn out the discs on all 10 of my seasons on DVD. I can't wait for the improved sound and picture quality. I imagine it will be phenomenal :) Will update review when product is released<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I don't like that the episodes on these discs are the truncated ones seen on TV, not the ones seen on the original DVD release of this show.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is interesting if you enjoy search and find games. Otherwise its boring. And the dialogue is boring too, skip it.

B000MV8AE0|2.0|I saw this movie on a TV station that interrupted, sometimes mid-scene, cutting hard from movie to commercial. And the frequency and length of commercial units was extremely distracting. They also included factoids about Beethoven on a 3rd-grade level.<br /><br />The much vaunted Beethoven's Ninth segment was destroyed by the vicious insipid cuts of the music. Ouch and ouch.<br /><br />The story is of course total fiction, which is not in itself a criticism, but had tender moments, though it was often just dopey. Beethoven is presented in a way that was actionable. And his quotable quotes were nonsense.<br /><br />However if you love Beethoven and are interested, you can at least see how he dressed, where he might have walked, how lighting and transportation were handled and to a lesser extent, ablution. Those are why I watched. The actress is adorable. Ed Harris' Beethoven is, dunno, I did not buy it--not his best work but not awful either. The bit with the nephew was filler.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|Two stars on the first listen, but then that was on the SP's web site stream of the whole album.  I could cry.  I was hopeful, but so far I just can't get into it.  But once I actually buy a CD I'll give it more chances.  I thought Zeitgeist(2007) was pretty good considering it was probably all just Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin.  I have all of the Pumpkins albums, EP's, and most singles (and minus a few early vinyl 7\\" singles).  Pretty much every song they recorded (the released stuff was fairly easy to find).  I have more bootleg SP material than I can remember.  But on first listen I found Oceania BORING, more like Zwan or a Corgan solo album.  Too much synthesizer.  The only song that I can remember the melody or riff of is \\"Pale Horse.\\"  That that is because I like the very atypical, for the SP, piano in the middle of the song.  The piano and then repeats of riff on guitar and Synth is nice. In all fairness I was in shock when Adore first came out, but grew to love it.  The songs on it work even better live.  Though I do like Nicole Fiorentino's bass playing.  Might even save the album for me.  So who knows...<br /><br />Note, my favorite SP albums are MCIS, SD, Gish, Adore, in that order.  I actually was an obsessed Smashing Pumpkins fan.  I have virtually every thing they released and then some, I have tons of bootleg and rare stuff.  So why would I even buy Oceania if I find it, not great or even boring in the end, completeness of my collection.<br /><br />P.S.  For a really cool rare SP old song, search out \\"Not Worth Asking\\".  Love it and it was only ever released as far as I know on a promo vinyl single.  But you should be able to find it as a DL in the Reel Time Studios recording mp3's. Oh, and this really is more of an opinion than a review.  Look to the 4 & 5 Stars for descriptive info about the songs.<br /><br />One of the older SP fans at 57!  - Mike

B0011UJMK2|4.0|Everything about this book was very good.  The pace was extremely fast.  The characters were well-developed.  Perhaps my only two gripes would be that the book could have been tightened up a bit (the plot seemed to stray at points), and the ending was slightly lackluster.  However, I'm definitely recommending that people read the book!
B000W93CHC|4.0|First, I have to say that Pillars of the Earth is one of my favorite books.  As long as that book was (almost 1,000 pages), I couldn't put it down.  I couldn't wait to read the sequel, World without End.  This was just about as good.  It takes place about 200 years after the first book and it has good characters, and a good plot.  There was one part, where the main character travels to find another character, that I thought was not realistic and I thought was a filler.  This was a small part in a huge book.  If you liked the first book and wanted more, this will hold you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The problem I have with this game is defeating the frog part. The game keeps me from boredom, which I experience a lot.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book reminded me of some of my favorite Jody Picoult books that I have read.  With family dynamics (parents and their 14 year old son), a crime, adolescent behavior and peer pressure, it kept me interested and then surprised me a couple of times at the end.  I was a little confused at the beginning with two different things going on, but it all came together at the end.  Good summer read.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|For those saying the movie is inaccurate with 'hard a starboard' and they turned the wheel to left (port)-  that is CORRECT!  Ships used what's called 'Tiller commands'. To turn left, you move the tiller handle the opposite direction! Think of a small outboard engine on a little boat. To go one way, you move the tiller handle the opposite way.<br /><br />People have no clue what they are talking about and then bash the movie. Sure, there are inaccuracies in any movie but it was really well done and James Cameron knows what he is talking about when it comes to the Titanic.<br /><br />This movie gets 5 stars for sure-
B004EPYZPS|4.0|....who are smart enough to travel througout the cosmos only to crash on our backwater planet and then get strung up by us?  Anyone?  Nah, didn't think so.  So what have we here?  An alien invades small town middle America as seen through the eyes of a bunch of kids number?  Feels like 1958?  Has the polish of 2008?  Yes, yes, and yes.  Abrams does Spielberg with Spielberg's help and blessing.  If you like Steven Spielberg's early silverscreen adventures and you like some of those old hokey (and I love me some hokey!) black-and-white alien invader flicks like \\"It Came From Outer Space\\" then you're going to feel like you're seventeen again as you watch \\"Super 8\\".  You know you're not seventeen anymore so go and watch it already!
0670023329|4.0|I want to start off by saying I normally do not review adult books on Mundie Moms. That doesn't mean I don't read them, because I do. My main focus on my blog is YA books, but there was something about this story that made me say yes to reviewing it here on the blog. It's not a heartwarming story nor is it a paranormal, contemporary or historical YA read that you'd normally see me get all excited about. Instead, this story is a brutal, horrifying, eye opening story into one man's survival, courage and bravery in escaping the unescapable Camp 14 in Northern Korea. After all, how can anyone escape an camp that's \\"non-exisstant\\".<br /><br />Part of me excepted this book to take place during a war. I foolish read camp and immediately thought of a prison camp. I've done a lot of reading up on WWII and the horrific things that happened then. I know all to well about the horrible things that happened in German prison camps during that time as my grandfather was a POW, but this story isn't one that happened during a war, this is a story that is happening now, in our day. Though the makings of this story started years and years ago, Shin's journey began in the early 1980's and ended recently when he escaped. Yes, I said recently.This is a story about incredible courage, the will to survive, and the unthinkable strength one man had to change his future, or to give himself a future he had no idea existed.<br /><br />This story is one that would have never had been told had it not been journalist Blaine Harden's promoting and for Shin's willingness to educate others about the horrifying atrocities that happen in this prison camps North Korea. Really this camp sounds more like concentration camp than a prison camp. It was sickening to me to find out that things like this still go on in the world, and what Shin had to endure since he was toddler. Not only that, I can't imagine what it was like for his late mother who didn't have any control over had really happened to her son. There's so much about this story that has left me a little lost for words about what I just read.<br /><br />Blaine does an amazing job at not only telling Shin's story, but he gives readers an understanding at how something like this has gone on unknown for so many generations. Shin's chilling details about his life in Camp 14 go beyond those that you'd find in a YA dystopian. The things Shin endure are unthinkable. Forced into hard labor at a young age, starved, beaten, and having to watch part of your family and even fellow prison mates killed in front of you are things I can't even imagine witnessing. What's more surprising about this story, is Shin is the ONLY known person to every escape Camp 14 and survive.<br /><br />Escape from Camp 14 will not only allow readers to met an incredibly courageous person, but it will definitely give readers a glimpse into the disturbing things that happen in one of the world's most mysterious, dark nations. This is a harrowing story I'd recommend to older, mature readers as there are some very disturbing scenes in this book. This story isn't for the faint of heart, but it's a powerful, thought provoking book that will haunt you long after you read it.ere's so much about this story that has left me a little lost for words about what I just read.<br /><br />Blaine does an amazing job at not only telling Shin's story, but he gives readers an understanding at how something like this has gone on unknown for so many generations.

B006LM6P0K|5.0|Emotionally wrenching.  Heartbreaking.  Transferred feelings of rage, bewilderment, abandonment, curiosity, jealousy, and scrutiny.  The viewer feels and understands all of these by way of Caesar, the chimpanzee that is born to a mother whose DNA was changed chemically.  Caesar is on the upward path of evolution and yet the simian whose mind is brighter than man's (at least most men's for the purposes of this movie) is still seen and treated as the chimpanzee he appears to be.  And he is not treated kindly.  So he takes matters into his own hands and quietly turns the tables on his captors while, a la Moses leading his people out of Egypt, leads his fellow apes into the great wilderness outside of San Francisco.  Meanwhile, the viral components that aided the evolution of he and his mother and some other testees is doing quite the opposite to the human population and we are seeing (not graphically, mind you) the very beginning of the near extinction of the human populace and the eventual rise of the immune and now humanly intelligent apes.  Great performances all around (especially by Andy Serkis and John Lithgow).  Sci-fi done right.  Looking forward to the inevitable sequel.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I have liked all games from G5. If you like hidden object this one is really good. Nice clear pictures and colorful.
B000001E8S|2.0|Hmmn.  I got this knowing it was an Eno/ U2 project.  I didn't realize just how much Eno was going to dominate within this project.  I know that Eno has brought a lot out in other artists but I am not a fan of his work per se.  And his moods and templates and thoughts are all over this music.  The U2 plays on this it does not feel like a U2 outing and that is definitely coloring my review.<br /><br />Taking its theme and cues from a variety of films I've never heard of each song is a musical reflection or feeling or soundtrack for that particular film.  I've never seen any of the films and so can't speak as to how well I think the music pairs up or evokes the celluloid but as for standalone songs?  Even the ones I enjoy just really aren't my style.<br /><br />1) United Colors  ~  Both weird and wonderful, going nowhere and everywhere.  Eno would like that.  This is a strong start to the album and a must listen with headphones.  Sounds like U2?  Negligible.  Thumbs up.<br />2) Slug  ~  Exploring bumps and thumps of noise; slow movements.  Sounds like U2?  Bono's vox are here otherwise it's all Eno.  Thumbs down.<br />3) Your Blue Room  ~  Slow, almost bluesy, not much energy to the music.  Sounds like U2?  Yes, from a b-side off of \\"Achtung Baby\\".  Thumbs down.<br />4) Always Forever Now  ~  Some energy is put back into the music but it really doesn't go anywhere.  Unfocused.  Sounds like U2?  Larry Mullen, Jr.'s percussion only.  Thumbs down.<br />5) A Different Kind of Blue  ~  A vocoder is used in this one, with lots of other distortions and out of tune plinkings and buzzing sounds.  Not much to recommend it.  Sounds like U2?  Nope.  Thumbs down.<br />6) Beach Sequence  ~  Again another quiet, interludinal song but this time with a simple and evocative piano line.  Sounds like U2?  Again, no.  But thumbs up.<br />7) Miss Sarajevo  ~  The most well known song off the album thanks in large part to Luciano Pavarotti sharing some vocal space with Bono.  The operatic portion is well-placed within the spark and acts as an emotional capstone to the song.  Sounds like U2?  Yes.  Thumbs up.<br />8) Ito Okashi  ~  Sung in Japanese.  A slow moving song.  Sounds like U2?  No.  Thumbs down.<br />9) One Minute Warning  ~  Lots of different ambient noises, reverberations, bits and pieces of voices and sounds over a variety of percussive notes.  Interesting and with potential but still a thumbs down.  Sounds like U2?  No.<br />10) Corpse (These Chains Are Way Too Long)  ~  The title is appropriate as this is more a piece about a mood of threading nihilism: there's a bit of notes and musical intentions going on but ultimately it's going nowhere and carries no other fundamental meaning.  Sounds like U2?  Bono's vox but otherwise no.  Thumbs down.<br />11) Elvis Ate America  ~  Aside from \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" this song stands out the most on this album.  That's usually a good thing but this song annoys the heck out of me.  Guest vocals from Howie B. have him calling out \\"El-ves\\" and keeping a steady, monotonous beat.  The song is fun from a lyrical standpoint...and yet I hate it.  Sounds like U2?  Bono's all over this but, again, otherwise no.  Thumbs down.<br />12) Plot 180  ~  Another soundscape and not bad on its own but in the company of the rest of these songs it maintains a downer, energy draining vibe.  It loses out due to this.  Sounds like U2?  No.  Thumbs down.<br />13) Theme From the Swan  ~  With the warm crackle of a mild backyard fire single notes stretch out and lay over a tapestry set up and hung like a hammock between two trees.  Sounds like U2?  No.  Thumbs up.<br />14) Theme From Let's Go Native  ~  Sounds like U2?  Thankfully and finally again, yes.  This song could have been a b-side off of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\".  Thumbs up.ortion is well-placed within the spark and acts as an emotional capstone to the song.  Sounds like U2?  Yes.  Thumbs up.<br />8) Ito Okashi  ~  Sung in Japanese.  A slow moving song.

B000Y7U98W|2.0|I love this movie. Having first seen it by renting it at one of those museums of the past known as Blockbuster, I was really satisfied. This movie is especially hard to find, as I have recommended it to several friends. It has not been at the Red Box recently nor is it currently on the Netflix streaming. I decided \\"What the heck?\\" let's just buy it on BluRay if we are going to actually purchase it. This is the perfect type of movie for this format because of the futuristic special effects. One problem: It has a glitch. Long story short, there is some kind of special feature meant to be activated I imagine upon your 2nd or 3rd viewing, at your leisure. Basically a window pops up, you lose the main audio, and a \\"Behind the scenes\\" mini movie starts playing on the bottom right fourth of the screen. There is no way to shut it off. I'm really annoyed! They need to fix this. I would recommend purchasing this film on regular DVD until a secondary issue is pressed on the BluRay format.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I play this game every chance I get!  It's an understatement to say that it's addicting!  I can't put it down!  Love it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I downloaded this to keep my 5 year old busy in a pinch... now she and my husband hog my phone all the time! They love it. :)
B001OQCV6A|3.0|The DVD arrived in good time. When I got around to opening it, I wondered if this DVD was really new or not. It was not sealed in the same way most new DVDs are. Kind of made me wonder if someone opened it, watched it, returned it.<br />It works fine.<br />The movie was fun, full of twists and action. Some lines were hard to understand. I might need to put on closed caption next time I watch it :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i think this game is fun to play because it has many different games just like what the game is called is what it has so it gives u what it says so get the game u mit really like it
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|For this type of game, it was thought out and done very well. graphics wise it's very attractive if in fact you like this type of game I would highly recommend it is fun an addictive. I don't know how long the developers to been business, but they did a very nice job.<br />give it a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B005HSL626|1.0|This game may be good on some devices however on the kindle fire it will sound but give you a black page and you cant cut see the fruit . I also had to reboot my kindle fire due to this app.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|First of all, let me say that I very much enjoyed this movie.  As such a lot of the criticism regarding it seems harsh to me.<br /><br />This movie is not all that original, but what do you expect from an adaptation of Snow White?  If the writers had gone too far outside canon people would have complained about it taking too many liberties with the original fairytale.<br /><br />I found most of the actors in the movie to have done a surprisingly good job.  With the exception of Kristen Stewart (who looks to be very bored through the entire film) all the actors seem to be having a good time and are for the most part believable.  I was actually a bit moved by a few of Chris Hemsworth's scenes and found him particularly good in his role.  Could they have done better?  Sure, but again, I wasn't going into this movie expecting some sort of Oscar winning performance.  I was going into it expecting an adaptation of Snow White.<br /><br />The movie does at times feel a little slow, but it isn't so horrific that you'd want to stop watching, and before you know it the plot is back on track.  I think the slow bits are really due to Stewart's somewhat unconvincing performance, as I found a lot of her scenes to be uninspired.  They really could have chosen someone better for the role of Snow White.<br /><br />As for the special effects?  I have nothing but good to say about them.  The movie is visually stunning and beautiful to look at.  The score, likewise, is very good.  James Newton Howard hasn't hit the mark like this in a very long time.<br /><br />On the whole, does this movie have flaws?  Absolutely.  But if you actually go into this film to have a good time and lose yourself in fantasy you'll enjoy it.  I've found that the people who hate this movie are going into it expecting far too much from a simple film.  Enjoy it like a movie-goer and not a movie critic and you'll love it.  Otherwise, you might want to hit up the Academy Award best picture list, because fun littlefantasy movies like this are not for you.
0345803485|1.0|After listening to people talking about Fifty Shades of Grey, I decided to jump on the bandwagon. I thought it must be something really good because there are a lot of people raving about it. Oh boy, was I wrong about it. This should teach me not to jump on a hype. My INNER GODDESS is screaming mad for having wasted precious time reading this book. It's a total RUBBISH.<br /><br />First, the writing. I felt like it was written by a high school kid. There's no way an adult writer can write this bad. If you are going to sell a book, shouldn't you at least have the decency to do spell checks, grammar checks etc??  The only way I can think about why the editor didn't do a good job at this is if she's spending so much time emailing her boyfriend/lover/husband just like Ana did with Christian. When I was in school, I learned that a good story plot would have to have a climax, but I felt that this book never had one. It's basically flat. Flat as my country of Holland.<br /><br />Second, the protagonist is annoyingly stupid. How on earth could Mr. Grey think otherwise?  Who sends kinky emails to their lovers using their office emails during office hours and not know that their emails might be monitored? SERIOUSLY?  She did ask if they are going to New York on Charlie One?  Did she think New York is next to Seattle? On top of that, she's acting like an adolescent more than an adult. GROW UP. Come on, James, surely you can do a better job at your characters?<br /><br />Third, some of the dialogues are silly. To add salt to the injury, these silly dialogues are being repeated one too many times. Same goes with the phrases and words. As somebody stated before, it's fun doing a kindle word count on how many times the author uses the same words and phrases. Surely Ms. James knows what a thesaurus is?<br /><br />I don't know how this book gets to go on the bestseller list. It's ATROCIOUS. I should have listened to my INNER GODDESS who suspected that this book is a overhype thrash.It's unfortunate that Amazon wouldn't let me give zero star. Even a star is too much.
0739384198|5.0|Lisbeth Salander returns in the third and possibly best of \\"The Girl who....\\" novels that have captured the imagination of women and men alike for its unique story line.  Simon Vance once again narrates, making a complex story easy to follow and absolutely compelling.<br />Stieg Larsson has given us a quirky, antisocial heroine whose very different philosophy of life will have you rooting for her every step of the way.  I loved this CD version of the book and recommend it highly.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|6/25/2012:<br />My wife and I were very excited to get our Withings Smart baby Monitor for our first child. It has a ton of great features like the temp, humidity, noise/movement graphs and more. Being able to have the monitor viewed on either of our iphones or ipad, was one of the top selling features.  Withings showed a lot of innovative in their design and execution of the Smart Baby Monitor, the price point seemed appropriate<br /><br />I've been using the monitor on my wife and baby while they sleep in the other bed room with a co-sleeper. I am doing this to be sure that the wi-fi and blue-tooth connection wouldn't be interrupted or drop off when we have the baby sleeping alone with just the monitor on him.<br /><br />Several times in the last week the monitor froze when monitoring mom/baby on the iPad (first generation wifi only, with wifi and bluetooth on). It looked like my wife was peacefully sleeping with the baby.  Really it seems that the connection was frozen.  A lot like in Ocean's 11 where they freeze the frame on a security camera while they break into the safe.<br /><br />Having the video and sound available on our iphone and ipad a great feature, but I would rather have a rock solid, uninterruptable connection between the video monitoring station and handheld viewer.<br /><br />This device needs to be 100% reliable in order for it to be useful for monitoring our child's safety.  If the reliability isn't addressed by the time we have the baby sleeping in the crib alone, then we will probably get another monitor.<br /><br />We've been using the monitor for 3 weeks, I will update this review in another 3-4 weeks.<br /><br />10/1/2012<br />We returned the monitor a few weeks after this review and got a Summer Infant Safe and Secure.  We've been very happy with the new monitor, especially since it was half the price of the Withings model.  We sleep so much better knowing that the connection isn't going to drop ever.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I find the game Boring, if they only made the graphics easier to see and not so dark. Other than that and the ads for their other games it could be a winner.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is such an excellent book.  Loved the characters.  The storyline has it's pros and cons, but all in all, it's believable, touching, and heartbreaking - all the while keeping you wondering what will happen with Travis and Abby.  Abby's backstory is interesting, too - I would've liked to read more about her past with her dad.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire is a gifted, self-published author.  She's currently writing a companion book from Travis' POV - already read some excerpts and it's soooo GOOD!!!  Can't wait to read it all!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great app that I have made part of my daily to do list of things that I want to do. I love the games, quotes, history, news stories. I have only started to use all this app has to offer.

1400069289|5.0|I must admit I am an easy target for this book.  I am relatively health concious, I am disciplined, I am an avid reader, and I love Fareed Zakaria who recommended it.<br /><br />First I have to say some critics are unfair in saying that the book does not provide a step by step approach.<br />The book in fact, provides MANY step by step approaches, and leaves you to create the one that works for YOU.<br /><br />Another critic said the author did not give credit to BF Skinner...ok, but he didn't mention Pavlov's dogs either....I think this is a red herring.  To list everyone who every studied behavior would be impossilbe.  I have heard much of this philosophy from Brian Tracy's 6 CD \\"Acheivement\\" collection. (which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to cultivate a high quality of life)<br /><br />The book is gripping from the first page to the last.  It tells of some really fascinating stories.  There are heroes and sorta kinda villians. It reaches you on an intellectual level and on an emotional level.  And it can HELP !<br /><br />I walk each and every day.  And I try to continually improve my diet.  I am not a \\"health nut\\" but I lead a healthy lifestyle.<br />Still, there are things I want to tweak, and DID !<br /><br />One was easy - I stoped recording two shows that I really do not need to watch.  I just did it and thought of the 90 minutes a day that is going to give me.<br /><br />The second was not as easy.  I wanted to fill my new 90 minutes with exercise.  After considering many options I chose swimming.  I now swim 30 laps each day - AND WHAT IS AMAZING IS I WILL STICK WITH IT BECAUSE I FOUND A \\"REWARD\\"  What I am really after is a flat tummy.  Now when I swim I take time to place my hands on my abdomen - when I swim I somehow feel thinner and my tummy feels flatter.  So I have positive re-enforcement.  And that is what this book gave me.  Anyone can create or break a habit, but you need to find meaningful positive re-enforcement.  Just as BF Skinner proved.  :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|I have blisters on my fingers, I just cant stop playing it. I totally recemendthis app to everyone everywhere in the world. Never freaking ending fun.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It has been a while since I picked up a book & stayed glued to it till the very last page without ever wanting to put it down! I even dreamt of it, that's how arresting it was.  Definitely a gripping page turner, it leaves you aching for more. At times repetitive, but never a bore. Now moving onto Fifty Shades Darker.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We love Harry Potter! Getting the whole set for less than our local stores rocked!<br />Set came on time in perfect condition. My kids have watched it all at least a dozen times now.
B001PPGAJE|3.0|I loved the movie, although, this is region locked to the US. Blu-Ray players or PS3 systems bought outside the USA will not play this movie. I made that mistake. Oh well! Free gift to someone.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The story is,  so far, mediocre,  but the item searches are challenging enough to entertain an adult.  (Though I am wondering if I should be wearing my glasses to make it easier on my eyes.  ;))
1466401885|5.0|I enjoyed reading this greatly written story.  Looking at some of the reviewers, I'm glad I didn't take heed of the \\"one star\\" ones.  Really, people, it is just a STORY. Stories are written to entertain, shock, or inspire.  When I read a book, I like to be challenged by its content, and this book did for me.  If I wanted simple, mindless, I would just turn on the TV and watch the crap \\"reality\\" shows shove down our throats every day.  Thank God for books like these that make me escape for a few hours. This story was VERY well written in my opinion.  Go ahead...read it, and have your own opinion before you decide those \\"one star\\" reviewers will be your voice and decision.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was completely satisfied with this product and enjoyed watching (and re-living) the saga with my children.  The HD quality was great and it's amazing to see how they did all the behind-the-scenes work and presented it in 360 degree views, etc.  In terms of the merchant, marcolaro83, they shipped our product immediately and we received it within a quick 2-3 days which was pleasantly surprising.  It was good doing business with them, especially since we got such a great price (with tax, we saved about $27 from what we would've purchased this set for at our local target).  I would definitely work with them again.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book examines the U.S. Presidency from the administration of Harry Truman to the present and illustrates the long term influence of those we elect to the highest executive position in the country. It is a must read for political junkies!!
0345803485|5.0|I was unsure whether I would like this book. Friends of mine were all reading it talking about how \\"great of a book\\" it was. So I decided I wanted to read it. Then one of my friends said it was like \\"mommy porn\\". Again I was skeptical, but decided to buy the books anyways. While I was awaiting for my books to be delivered, I heard other conversations about the book. People told me that it was about S&M and Bondage. I immediately assumed that I would not like the books, unfortunetly I already ordered them. When the books did arrive I figured I would start reading them to see if they were any good, since I already paid for them. I started reading this book and I immediately found it very interesting. The further I read into the book the harder it was to put it down. Needless to say I read the whole book in less than 24 hours. And had to see what was goin on in book two..... I would definetly recommend this book to others, it was the best book I have read in a long time. And it has become a group discussion between my friends and my co-workers, as most of them have read the books or are currently reading it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great App!<br />Love this app<br /><br />Love the graphics and storyline-very easy to navigate.<br />Keeps you interested and is challenging.  Would definitely recommend!
B0086700CM|3.0|Its a fun game but really temple run? don't try to get people to buy more coins just for a game
B0086700CM|5.0|For all you Temple Run- one star- haters let me explain this to you. When you run you collect coins then you buy stuff with the coins. It only costs money if you want coins without actually earning them, and to that one dude do you not see the word FREE at the top?! I honesty love the game a awesome time killer. It's a really fun challenge and I've already gotten up in the millions.
0061765236|4.0|I'm a little confused why some people say that don't understand why Emily was suicidal. She was molested and had been living with that for years without any help. What other reason do u need??? Combine that with the pressure to be perfect and you don't get a good result. She felt like she had already disappointed everyone by getting molested, she assumes its her fault. I honestly think she loved Chris but she couldn't get over her past. I don't think she would have ever been able to have a normal sexual experience with any man. One if the reasons she couldn't get the abortion, she couldnt stand the examination, it reminded her of getting molested. Anyways I understand fully why she wanted to kill herself. Maybe some of the reader can't comprehend what it's like to be molested at a young age, having the pressures of being perfect, being pregnant and knowing you will get married when you can't stand for a guy to touch you. In my mind, she was just a really messed up girl, made me sad that she felt like she couldn't tell anyone what happened. It's realistic though
0345803485|1.0|This book is the WORST I've read all year. Make that past 5 years. I got sucked in by the hype that surrounded it and it got to a point where I felt I needed to read it just to be in tune with the rest of mainstream America. It's touted as female erotica but barely a chapter into the book I want to slap both main characters. They have zero substance and the writing is so Sweet Valley High that it's laughable. At least with SVH you knew what you were going to get. WIth this, it tries so hard to be sexy that it fails miserably. It cannot decide if it wants to be brainless chick lit or be brave enough and actually dive into actual erotica. All the sensual scenes are tepid at best and after each act you have to read about the female lead's struggle with her \\"inner goddess\\". Puh leeeze! And as for Christian Grey, omg... what a lame duck. He's supposed to be domineering and he's the biggest wuss in the story. Plus, did I mention about the writing style? Complete turn-off. I don't understand how any woman can find Fifty Shades of Grey arousing. Do yourself a favor and don't bother buying this book.
160459201X|5.0|I read this book back in the mid 1990's for the first time. Since then, I've had many opportunities to try and to test the various contentions of this author. As a result, I have concluded that there is a great deal of truth to many of his premises, given in this book. This book must be read with a very open mind and a commitment to not judging any of the concepts until you've had an opportunity to test them for yourself. However, that being said, I believe you will find this to be an amazing book. This book is truly one of my \\"all time favorites\\"!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|This headphones completely change the way I work with audio.  They sound great and I can wear them for long sessions with out hurting my ears. They are really comfortable to wear and fit my ear perfectly.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|So far so good. I was afraid the screen would too small to find the objects easily. I find some to. Well disguised but most are ok I love hidden object games so I am happy with this one. Now to get back to the game!  5 stars from me.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I can't decide if I like this app or Pulse better. The one tweak that would make me choose this one would be the ability to change the text size, especially in the included web browser.
B007VYBFA2|5.0|Usually don't tend to buy episodes because I wait for the dvd sets but I couldn't wait. Epic scene that I won't spoil for you in case you are enthralled by the Damon/Elena/Stefan triangle.
B000B5XOXY|4.0|Of all the Batman films, the two Joel Schumacher films are often the most hated by fans. While I'll admit Batman & Robin was indeed a bad film, Batman Forever is not. I feel it's a very underrated superhero film that only gets bashed because people like the Christopher Nolan films more, which I find unfair. This is a film that actually tries to be a very different Batman movie without changing the lore of the character (unlike the Nolan films which feels like they wrote the script first then threw Batman in later). While it doesn't top the Tim Burton films (my personal favorite Batman films), it doesn't seem like it tries to while it goes for a different take. We get a film that is much more lighthearted and fun, but still has hints of darkness and sadness. It's a film that tries to be a follow up to the Burton films while still starting fresh. It's not a reboot that tries to erase/ replace what was already set up in the earlier films (like what all reboots do today sadly *cough Amazing SM*), but actually tries to be another chapter to Batman's legacy. It also has much more of a story than any of the Batman films do. It actually has Bruce Wanye finding a deeper meaning as to why he choses his duel life. \\"I am both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Not because I have to be, because I chose to be.\\" The film I believe has the 2nd best action scenes of the entire series, only beaten by The Dark Knight (which I also like, but find extrmely overrated). Batman uses much more martial arts than before and we also see the batmobile in action as well. We also see more gadgets for Batman to use.<br /><br />  Val Kilmer is very good as Bruce Wayne/Batman. While I still prefer Keaton's unassuming yet badass take of our hero, Kilmer still does a fine job. He gives us a man who is troubled by his past mistakes, but knows he needs Batman in order to prevent others from suffering. I think he totally tops both George Clooney & Christain Bale as Batman. He gives us a character more closer to the books than any before.<br /> Chris O'Donnell I thought made a very convicing Dick Grayson/Robin. In this film, he's not downplayed as a sidekick but he comes off a brash young man going threw the same stage as Bruce Wayne suffered at the same age. He even makes a funny refence to the \\"Holy *something* Batman\\", but in a way you wouldn't expect.<br />  Jim Carrey is always fun to watch in any role, it was no different for him playing Edward Nygma/The Ridder. While I'll admit he does come off as being himself more rather than being the character, it's not a bad thing. He is a funny guy, but he does have a dark side. Most noticably in his intro, he shows his dark side when Bruce rejects his brain wave invention. It comes off as \\"I liked you, now I hate you\\" kind of relationship with the two. He has a ton of great moments like when he destroys the Bat Cave (another thing other BM films rarly do).<br />  Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/ Two-Face is really the only character I have mixed feelings for. While I love Tommy Lee Jones and I think he is an ideal choice for the part, his performence is really against character. Two Face is more of a tragic character that has a very Jekyell/Hyde feeling. But in this film, he is just a goof ball who just flips his coin and laughs a lot. But it does appear that Mr. Jones (LOL MIB) looks like he's having fun in the role.<br /> I don't have much to say about Nicole Kidman's Chase Merridan, but damn she is hot in this movie.<br /> Of course, we wouldn't really have a Batman movie without Alfed whom was still wonderfully play by Micheal Gough (RIP).<br /><br /> But I do have to mention some problems that I agree with. I do feel that it gets goofey at some parts, like when Two Face & Riddeler are fighting over who uses the brain wave device in a very cartoony matter and even when those two are playing battleship against Batman & Robin. The absording brain wave part of the story was a bit over the top and weird. There was also too much neon lights all over the place in the movie. I also feel like this film tries to hard to be more mainstream appealing by toning down certain aspects of the film.<br /><br /> Overall, while this film isn't anywhere near the masterpieces that are the Tim Burton films, it still comes of strong as it's own. This was actually the lst Batman movie I saw in theaters (while Returns was the lst one I EVER saw). I still think people should at least give this film a watch before making the choice of flat out saying \\"it sucks because The Dark Knight was better\\". It may have some goofy bits that makes this film more cartoony, but ask yourselves \\"What superhero movie doesn't have goofy/ cartoony scenes?\\" Avengers had alot of them yet nobody complains about that. I say give this film a chance and judge it for yourself.on lights all over the place in the movie.

B007R41E8O|1.0|i have a kindle fire and was never able to get it to download.  it got stuck in an endless cycle where it would download then verify then start downloading again. it was disappointing because it looked like a fun game.  :(
B002L4QP0M|1.0|I was extremely disappointed by this book. Long live the pathetic cliché! The author didn't leave out a single one. It was so extremely foreseeable that I spent most of my time with a running curiosity on whether a single platitude would be left out. My sincere advice, please do not waste your time with this book. Read something by Forsyth or if must be Clancy. Just stay away from this book
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I bought this set before but gave it away.  Could not live without a set of my own.  Will watch this every few months from now on.  Great story, great stars, great scenery, great costumes, great extras on the dvds.  Great, great, great.
B005HEW7LY|4.0|This episode is a character piece that serves to further introduce Tuvok and Paris as well as some Delta Aliens at war. The ending deductions made by Tuvok might seem a little unbelievable, but I still had a lot of fun watching the process of how the crime was resolved. I have a feeling Tuvok is going to become one of my favorite on this show, in a way he reminds me of Data since he is matter of fact and has no emotions. I have heard about 7 of 9 from friends who have seen this series already...so I can imagine having her and Tuvok around is going to get funny fast. I give it 4.25/ 5
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|just down loaded and will uninstall. good gamexcept that when I exited a message popped up saying progress will not be saved!!! Crap. whats the use in playing if you have to keep starting over?
B005HEWO6W|4.0|So is Neelix like the Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek, well actually he came before Jar Jar *nightmarish flashbacks*...why does he even exist?! Oh but that's just a minor issue I have so far with this series. This episode was excellent, already the captain is turning out to be much more interesting that I had anticipated. Janeway seemed a bit stiff and plain in the first few episodes, but now I see that the writers have much more planned for her. And the crew that supports her seems just as varied, I can already see the relationships, fights, and comradery that will occur in future episodes. I'm excited to see how Voyager stacks up to DS9 and TNG :)
B002ZG9788|3.0|I will break down ths review by story, presentation and critic. Clash of the Titans begins with a recap of the unseen war between the Titans and the Olympians in which Hades creates the Kraken from his flesh and defeats the Titans yet still is swindled from his place as ruler of Olympus by his brother Zeus. The Gods rule the world from Mt. Olympus and need the prayers of mortals to sustain them, however, fed up with the Gods, mortals have begun to foresake them and thus set up the events of the film. Perseus, the son of Zeus, witnesses his family die and seeks revenge against Hades. Meanwhile, Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken unless Andromeda is sacrificed and Perseus must make a perilous journey to claim the head of Medusa in order to fight the Kraken.<br /><br />The movie is visually wonderful, I did not care so much for the 3D effects but it looks nice on Blu-ray. The action sequences are intense, the Kraken is massive and Sam Worthington gives us a good performance. Early in the film, you can see he is a simple man who loves his family and appreciates all that life has given him, as his family is taken away from him, his sole purpose is to avenge them and he never loses sight of his purpose. The sound quaility is good and the scenes on Olympus are stunning and the lighting gives a regal yet divine feel to the scene.<br /><br />The story is where this movie is at it's weakest. I assume the writer went to the George Lucas School of Writing.I understand this is not a remake but rather a relaunch for a potential movie trilogy but the mythology is lost and given a bad sci-fi movie of the week tone. The Gods need prayers to answer humanity's requests but humanity refuses to pray because the Gods don't answer so the Gods are weaken and are unable to respond until they get prayers, see the problem? Hades makes the Kraken which killed the Titans, then why didn't he use the Kraken to muscle Zeus out of Olympus in the first place? There was no romance between Andromeda and Perseus so there was no sense of urgency to protect her. There are lots of plotholes but if you don't take them to heart, this is a good movie and a good way to spend a weekend afternoon.
B005HEW70A|5.0|I thought I had the ending of the episode all figured out when I was only 15 minutes in, but the last 10 minutes surprised me. It was a nice twist on a rather common Trek phenomena, and the writing really sealed the deal. I will not summarize or give any more detail for fear of spoiling any of it, so just watch it....you wont regret it.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|In 1982, John Carpenter unleasehed \\"The Thing\\" and audience were still weepy over E.T. so this masterpiece of suspense and horror got buried under the ice....until it came out on video and now we have the latest update simply titled \\"The Thing\\" released in 2011. During the original movie, many questions were left unanswered, what happened in the Norwegian camp? How did the Thing looked like while it was still in the ice? What happened to McReady and Childs? Unfortunately, Hollywood likes to take steps back instead of forwards and we will never know of McReady and Childs (unless a sequel is made, hopefully).<br /><br />The prequel takes place just before the original when a group of Norwegians stumble upon an alien spacecraft buried deep in the ice, the customary grumpy scientist flies to America and recruits the young hero, Kate Lloyd to go and discover what lies underneath the ice. The cast is filled with international stars, which is refreshing, however, if the filmmakers wanted to keep with the original tone set by the first movie, the Norwegian camp probably would have filled with men doing their work just like in Carpenter's film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is one dimensional and unlikable, she is clearly a Ripley clone where you know no danger will come to her and the story is too afraid to cause her any harm other than her hair getting messy, unfortunately there is no strong central character to root for like in the original. The writer tries very hard to tell a compelling story, filled with suspense and horror and sadly misses the point.<br /><br />I know many reviews compare this movie to the original but is what happens when a prequel/sequel fails to tell a story and keep the audience interested. Everybody in the camp are just victims for the CGI Thing and the visual effects rely too heavily on CGI to convince anybody that the Thing is something to be feared. The Thing's first, brief appearance is interesting and then is never seen again, the restis just sloppy mash ups of victims and guts. The story leaves off for a sequel but by the end of the movie, you feel nothing for Kate and the writer tries to sneak in the opening scene of the first film in an effort to redeem itself but at the end, it is simply better to enjoy the original and ignore this one.<br /><br />The Blu-ray does deliver a clear picture and sound,the extra features are worth a look at and the movie looks amazing on a 1080P TV.The Thing's ship looks amazing and the film does capture a bit of the doomed atmosphere of the original, except you can see the Thing a mile coming and all the suspense of where the Thing is hiding among the cast is gone. I do enjoy this movie mainly because it grants us an opportuntity to discuss it's strenghts and weaknesses and it does flow smoothly into the original so you can enjoy a back to back Thing marathon.
B005HEWK1Q|4.0|A terrific episode, one for all to enjoy and also important to this series. I take these reviews seriously and am disappointed that others would leave spoilers in their reviews and sometimes even in their bylines *facepalm* Give the people a bearing on whether they will enjoy the episode, don't give it all way guys : <br /><br />Also It's funny how Tuvok is the least bit interested in making friends or conversing with the crew, yet he finds him self the center of attention and befriending someone new every episode :)
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Robert Downey jr, and Jude Law make a wonderful pair as Holmes and Watson and A Game of Shadows takes it up a notch. Holmes has met his intellectual match in Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) who not only plans to launch a massive war in Europe but make himself incredibly wealthy and rid himself of his arch enemy at the same time.<br /><br />The first twenty minutes of the film establishes Moriarty as Holmes' equal and he clearly places our heroes in great peril. Rachel McAdams does a cameo and Stephen Fry (of Blackadder and Fry and Laurie fame)also appears as Sherlock Holmes' smarter brother. While Jared Harris' Moriarty is not as imposing as Mark Strong's Lord Blackwood, Moriarty does have numerous henchman to do his dirty work and there is a scene which Harris displays his acting range in a chilling scene where he tortures Holmes with a calm and ruthless demeanor and while Holmes manages to escape, he is left physically weaken for his upcoming duel with the professor.<br /><br />The movie looks brillant and captures the sense of adventure and danger to satisfy both action and detective fans alike. I would rate this movie 5 stars however the blu ray combo pack lacks a digital copy. I went to numerous stores trying to find one and it is only available with Ultraviolet, which is not mainstream yet and I have no desire or interest in their service. The first Sherlock Holmes came with a digital copy which I enjoyed on a flight to Germany, sadly, if I want one of this film I will have to buy it twice. I have no issues buying a movie by itself, I've done it many times but when it is advertised with a digital copy, I expect a digital copy I can use on my PC or iTunes.<br /><br />Regardless of the digital copy, the film is worth owing and watching over and over again, the Train scene and the final confrontation with Downey and Harris makes this movie a must see and here is hoping for another adventure.
B005HEVY54|4.0|The Prime Directive doesn't look so perfect from the other side, in this case the Feds are the primitive culture who so badly needs that sweet sweet technology :D I started watching this series almost a year ago, and gave up after the first 3 episodes...thought it was boring, I didn't like Janeway, and I hated Neelix. Now I'm glad my friend convinced me to give it a second chance...coming off watching DS9 it's refreshing to see Star Trek happen on a starship again!! The crew, Janeway, and the plot is really growing up me!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|One of the most intriguing aspects of George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice may also be its most annoying. The first novel in the series, A Game of Thrones, often gets bogged down in the very description needed to create the vaguely medieval setting. Needless to say, the fantasy genre requires patience, and luckily this book delivers to those willing to overlook (or perhaps skim) some of the more overblown parts to be rewarded by the author's knack for spinning an unparalleled plot.<br /><br />The heart of the story boils down to the struggle for political domination as well as the more intimate struggles between families, friends, and lovers. The chapters alternate limited third-person viewpoints of a cast of approximately 20 different characters and the author doesn't play favorites. At any given moment George R. R. Martin may kill off an important character because that is how the cutthroat world of the novel works; fan favorites be damned.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the novel contains a wealth of strong female characters whose presence creates a fuller picture of the factors that contribute to a struggle for world domination on a planet where the Stark family motto, \\"Winter is coming,\\" adds a layer of complexity to the prospect of a cold spell that could last years and with it bring even darker times for humanity as well.<br /><br />The thematic element most integral to the foundation of the Fire and Ice series comes toward the end of A Game of Thrones when Sansa, Eddard Stark's daughter thinks, \\"In life, the monsters win.\\" What George R. R. Martin's fantasy series makes clear is that within everyone there is a monster and the reader will be continually torn by which character to side with. Luckily, the saga continues, and each reader will see a bit of themselves in the strengths and weaknesses of each character.<br /><br />The temptation to read A Game of Thrones arose only after a marathon session of watching all of the first season via HBO on Demand before the premiere of this April's season two premiere. It will be interesting to see how my perception of the series changes if I am able to read the third book BEFORE the premiere of the series' third season (which is said to only cover half of book three). In the meantime, I'll find some great fan sites and devote some time to studying character descriptions and plot summaries!<br /><br />JeriWB.coma HBO on Demand before the premiere of this April's season two premiere.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I kept waiting to be disappointed based on other reviews, but I was not at all disappointed.  The ending had to be on a down note of sorts, unless you live in a dream old where all humankind is wonderful and full of love and smiles.  A very realistic ending.  And I am glad with whom she spent the rest of her life.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the simplicity and atmosphere of this game.  It's easy to play and the difficulty increases at just the right rate.  The gentle music and rustic country theme is also a neat little addition.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this series to see what the hype was all about.  To be honest I was shocked at how poorly it was written.  I'm not sure if I've ever read a book that had so much awkward wording.<br /><br />Every 5 pages is a sex scene and nothing super kinky really ever happens.  By the end of the third book I was just skimming through these parts to get to an actual story line.<br /><br />I do have to give the author some credit...I managed to read all 3 books in about 2 weeks.  The story line ends up sort of intriguing and you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />My advice? Go ahead and read it to see what the hype is all about.  They aren't terrible books and what girl doesn't want to read a juicy romance series over the summer??
055338466X|1.0|There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I lost faith from an early stage that I was going to be enlightened about the fundamental questions of life.<br /><br />Hawking states \\"Philosophy is dead\\", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically advances ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as \\"who created God?\\". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.<br /><br />Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science.<br /><br />Hawking advances M-theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence at a later date. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|The best of the Hunger Games Triology. It had me on the edge of my seat for the entire book and I couldn't put it down!<br />Adventure packed, violent, but also dramatically entertaining and emotional. A must read!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Prometheus is a pathetic prequel to Alien. What a stunning disappointment.<br /><br />This is sci-fi for morons. Anyone with half a brain can see the problems with this story. The writers should have their fingers broken, and Scott, well he's the guy who brought these guys on. He'll have to suffer the collateral damage to his reputation.<br /><br />I have no problem with the production values, it looks great, but a scientist petting an alien, puh-lease, somebody save me. One of many laughable scenes in the film.<br /><br />I won't go over all the idiotic story elements, they are well documented in scores of reviews.<br /><br />Just let me say be sure you are brain damaged or really really stoned when you watch this and it just may work for you.

1451627289|5.0|I hate you! WHY would you write a book like 11/22/63, when you KNEW, that your Constant Readers will have a hard time finding ANYTHING that can match it for a loooong time? Was that your agenda? Writing a book, that people will talk about, and long to come back to, for ages? You made me laugh out loud twice, made me cry (in public!!) thrice; you had me turning pages on the edge of my seat and being downright frustrated for 800+ pages. You wanted to destroy readers' experiences and expectations for the next stack of books they're going to read? If so, you succeeded. I loved the book and thus I hate you.<br />Sincerely.
B000I9TXK6|4.0|Prior to seeing this film, being gay was either a joke or a crime.  This movie permitted people to see that being gay is normal and loving and acceptible.  It make all the changes that are occurring in society today permissible.  Thanks to Ang Lee for creating this cinema masterpiece.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|An amazingly extensive app,  especially for being free!  I would recommend it to anyone. The only improvement I would like to see are more audio Bibles,  especially a Spanish version though that is asking a lot for a free app that already has so much. To all those who made it available - thank you!!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Thia looks like a fun app with lots of potential, but it doesn't work on the Samsumg Galaxy 4g S. I get as far as the home screen before it repeatedly force closes. I was really looking foward to using this, mostly because of the reviews, now I'm just really dissapointed. I guess its designed for tablets...
B0074JODP8|5.0|All I can say is... I wish Joe Bonamassa would play me like he does his guitar, while singing to me, of course. Whew. I have never understood the \\"groupie\\" thing until now.  What am amazing talent. I am not easily impressed, having come from a classical background, myself.  But, I happened across this performance on PBS and was absolutely overwhelmed.  He is a phenomenal talent - true genius. The interview with him also revealed a man of great humility and generosity of spirit.  Not a bad combination.  I hate it that terms like \\"genius\\" and \\"artist\\" are used so loosely, indiscriminately, and irreverently these days.  He truly deserves them. I hope that I am able to see him perform in person some day. I will be stocking up on his music, in any form, as much as possible.

B007ZCQJOM|4.0|Beach House continue to perfect their perfect their sound  on this album. While the album doesn't have quite the passion or greatness of Teen Dream, the production values on this album are slightly higher, and the songs are still excellent. I would highly recommend this album.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|I became a fan a bit later in the game.  My brother loved the Smashing Pumpkins from the beginning, but I didn't catch on until Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.  After that, I became a really, really big fan and I quickly came to enjoy the earlier stuff as well.  To this day, I still regard MCIS as one of the most enjoyable and one of the greatest rock releases of all time.  It is so impressive -- two discs packed full of great songs without a bad one in the bunch.  This immediately struck me as true creative genius, with deep and sometimes obscure lyrics, intricate arrangements, blistering riffs, and many epic moments.  It is truly astounding.  So, admittedly, I might be living in the past or searching for something rather than accepting the new album for what it is.  However, I think that isn't entirely true, and you can be the judge as I make my points.<br /><br />So, I begin to play the tracks on Oceania.  The first song gets going and I think, \\"Oh, cool, a riff reminiscent of the older stuff.  I'm in for a treat!\\"  Then Billy begins to sing, and it's not bad, but I was expecting more intense vocals with the raw emotion that Billy conveyed so well in all of the vocals throughout his range, whether they were raging or gentle.  A recurring theme in this album are vocals that kind of leave things flat.  Are the days gone where Billy could go from a gentle whisper to an all-out scream in the same verse?  That kind of build-and-release can really resonate with people!  On Oceania, the vocals did not get me excited.  His singing is never bad, but it is not very compelling, either.<br /><br />I do like that the first couple songs on the album rock at least a bit.  But then the album drifts away into more mediocre love songs that are fairly forgettable.  The standout song in the middle (mediocre part) of the album has to be Violet Rays where he raises the emotion a bit.  It might not be the best track on the album, but it is the best of the slower songs, in my opinion.  Then there are some songs that verge on being bad, like \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\" and the album closer, \\"Wildflower\\".<br /><br />Like me, did you love hearing that one epic song on each album?  Not that it was always the favorite song on the album, but we all loved \\"Porcelina\\", \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\", \\"Glass and the Ghost Children\\".  Unfortunately that type of song is not here.  When I saw that the title track was nine minutes long, I thought that was going to be the epic song of the album.  I won't say that it's the worst track, but it is a bit meandering and it never seems to culminate in greatness like I was hoping.<br /><br />This makes me wonder if Billy is not 99% of the Smashing Pumpkins.  I have always thought that the band was really mainly him, and the other members were more like his touring musicians in a way.  But Oceania is more reminiscent of Zwan and Billy's solo material than of the material up through Mellon Collie.  Maybe the difference is how Billy has grown and matured over the years.  Maybe he has lost some of his passion and angst while still retaining his brilliance, but that brilliance is not delivered in as compelling of a vehicle as before.<br /><br />So, in short, the album really isn't grabbing me like Mellon Collie and the previous records *still* do.  It seems like Billy is still a fantastic talent and he can still put together an album that is mechanically and auditorily stunning.  However, it really seems to be lacking in emotion and intensity and anything to really hook the listener.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I bought this Disney movie for my collection as I enjoyed them growing up and wanted to also be able to share with children that come to visit me and in time for my grand kids. The DVD was packaged very well and I especially like the outside cover that it comes in which protects the movie itself. It was received in wonderful condition and I have no complaints.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I enjoy reading a wide variety of books.  This book, however, repeats extremely erotic scenes of a deviant nature over and over.  It takes a great deal of patience to dig to the bottom for the real story line.  I believe this is a book that is receiving too much press for a \\"hot\\" book.  But, maybe I am just the \\"hearts and flowers\\" type of gal.  The male character, Mr. Grey, was abused as a child, and that is pointed out.  I just did not feel the book was really worth the press it is receiving on television or the Internet.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I chose this move because of the ratings and I am glad I did. It was enjoyable and can be watched by anyone. The packaging was in great shape and received timely. I will definitely buy form this seller again.

Quick, easy, \\"Idiot Proof\\" (which I need)!.<br />In addition to a great product, this company truly understands the meaning of \\"customer service\\".

Highly recommend this product, and will not hesitate to order from the company in the future!

B007MDQW3W|2.0|It's a decent album, the best song is Don't Leave Me.  Most of the album is way too similar to Tori Amos, if you have Tori's albums, not much point to buying this one.  And yes, admittedly, there are some elements of bad singing in small doses in some parts of some songs, nothing too overwhelming though.  Cool album cover.

B007H7XJD4|1.0|What an incredible let down!<br /><br />The shiny special effects glimmered and shimmered - but any semblance of a good story was totally missing.  This was a movie I watched while travelling.  I think staring at the back of the seat in front of me would have had more plot.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I got this as a bithday present for my dad.  His favorite historical character is Spartacus so I really thought he would enjoy the show and I figure I can get him the other seasons as gifts for other occasions.  He absolutely loved it so I am happy.
0345522303|2.0|I'll just risk the \\"not helpful\\" votes. I have read the Nightrunner series probably more than 10 times so far. My heart is for liking the latest installment, too. But it's just too bad. There were so many open threads from the previous novels - Seregil's resilience to magic. The Klia-Phoria controversy (remember how Klia was undercut in her negotiations in Aurenen?). Ilar survived, remember? What's with Oolu that didn't break? Sebrahn and the dragon aura? But here we are, back to Kylith, Myrhichia and the Cat as if our heroes had never taken their years in the mountains and survived necromancy and alchemy. At the Stag and Otter (wasn't it supposed to be called the Dragon and Owl once?). But that is not the worst. It's boring. There is no plot, since you know it all, thanks to the Atre character perspective. We witness our heroes muddling through, but know they are off the track. They do not even have sex. Best friends forever. That lasted till about 30 pages before the end. And then they suddenly act out of character. When Seregil handed the poniard to Micum. I couldn't believe my eyes - since when is lynching ok? Death penalty for the villain: ok, given the setting. But murder in cold blood, against an enemy already down and critically wounded? What happened here, what was that supposed to achieve? I suddenly find myself disliking Seregil and Micum with all my heart. The kissy-kissy between Phoria and Klia, and the foregone chance to portray a real conflict of politics like in \\"Traitor's Moon\\", gives it the rest. A really bad book that I will have to do my best to ignore when rereading parts 1-5, as I plan to.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I can understand why non-Rush fans would not like it. I am assuming that is why they gave is less than 5 starts.<br /><br />For the rest of us - THIS IS COOL! Some of us know all the stories, most of us done. And hey - even if you have heard them before, its tool to have the band telling them. Its just great. All the way through.<br /><br />And yes, our wives left as it went on, and did something else. Oh well.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is amazing!! I love it! I use it all the time with pictures that don't turn out the way I want them to and it fixes them right up to where they look perfect :) I would highly recommend this
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Even though I am only halfway through the book, I needed to write this review.<br /><br />I have been reading some of the negative comments and to me I believe that the book is just too real, too human, to actually concieve some of the concepts in it. We readers choose to read to escape the hardships of everyday life but then come across this one to read more about hardships. Mockingjay really grasps that the world can be a cruel and merciless place which turns readers down alot.<br /><br />People have been talking about how &#34;soft&#34; Katniss has become but if you think about all of the mental and physical breakdowns, practicaly one after another after another, and to see the few pople who would love you unconditionaly deteriorate, you would be getting &#34;soft&#34; too.<br /><br />I have only read this book halfway so far because I am only allowing myself a few pages at a time so that i can digest what is happenning and that this isnt a cozy little fairytale but a realistic novel about death and how you can never say &#34;what else could possibly happen?&#34;. Because we are all human it is of our nature to bring down others for your rise and that there is no utopian society. There is no &#34;perfect&#34; and people will only get worse and worse. Collins accentuates this and readers are just too caught up in what they thought this book should be like when you cant change it, just like in real life when there are thing that you want to take back so bad that it hurts but you must learn to live with it.<br /><br />I am sorry if this book did not live up to your expectations but you know what? Life doesn't either.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's pretty fun, but I wish it would be a little easier for younger people to enjoy. You have to have lots of skill to be able to play, and that's a requirement!

0099579936|1.0|I had high hopes when I checked out this book.  But after reading the excerpt on my Kindle (thank you Amazon!) I knew my hopes would be dashed.  The characters are so...dumb!!...that I just couldn't finish the book.  I absolutely HATE Kate and the way she thinks and acts.  Anastasia is annoying as can be.  The only slightly interesting and well-written character is Christian Grey.  Call this book what it is: a Harlequin Blaze book.  I like those but they are not less than I expect and sometimes even more. Ms. James wrote a bunch of sex scenes (at least those are well written) and tenuously linked them with sentences.  That's how I used to write my college papers!<br /><br />I am very happy I did NOT spend money on this book.  I couldn't even finish it and obviously have no intention of reading the other two.  Don't waste your time; DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!
1451627289|1.0|I first found this novel like most other readers, through the best seller list. I spent months anticipating this novel. I was excited to finally have the time to sit down and divulge into a thick historical novel. I was all to wrong about this novel. I found little fire in the writing and felt as if the book had no plot, other than the obsolete plot point to save JFK. I convinced myself to keep reading however when I reached page 450 I was at my breaking point. The last 400 pages I skimmed and I am thankful I ended it that way.
B007WV05GY|1.0|Between crazy wolf behavior, unresourceful plane survivors, the main character's conflicting personality, (the list goes on and has already been mentioned), it really is a bad movie.  If you have any faith whatsoever, the movie is an anti-God movie disguised as an action flick.  It was pretty detailed in its objections to God, but it didn't even attempt to explain in a real way the validity of God.  It's like watching a one-sided argument for the most part.  I respect the right for people to not believe, but if you are going to present a debatable point in a movie, at least present both sides well.  After watching this movie, it left this hopeless, meaningless, I-just-wasted-my-time feeling in my gut.  The movie really just reaffirmed my faith in God because I never would want to live or die with this sort of mentality.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun. I recommend thisfor all ages. it is very addicting. it is also fun to play with on long car trips.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As I wrote on the last one: this book is definitely targeted toward younger readers. However, the author makes it interesting enough for an adult to read it with just as much enthusiasm. I was not a fan of this genre but decided to read the trilogy after hearing reviews from my wife. The book has some nice twists and turns even though Katniss can be a bit of a drama queen sometimes. Haymitch is a great character and seems to add to the story as do all the other characters. The descriptions of some of the future items, such as \\"morphling\\" or the character \\"Peeta\\" can get annoying. Why not just call it morphine and name him Peter? But this book is for teenagers so I guess it comes with the territory.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this game is pretty fun. i like the graphics I play for a while then break and play again great
0439023513|5.0|Okay I must admit that the book got me. I was riveted throughout most of it. The entire series keeps you hooked but the action-packed sequences in this book make you stick to the pages. I'm sure the ending is liked by just as many who don't like it but I think it all fit in with the entire trilogy. While I would have liked to have seen Katniss grow up and stop all the drama before the epilogue, the story's ending did fit entirely. In fact, loose ends are neatly tied up and we even get a glimpse into her future. What more can you ask for? This story will make a great movie for sure.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie is not typical. It is imaginative, historical (that's right, pull out those art/language history books people!) and romantic in the most orginal fashion. I wanted to see the movie, but was still hesitant because it is not a big action film. I watched it and I love watching it over and over again. It is interesting, entertaining, and so twisty it's fascinating. Just try it... you'll love it
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book and the story behind it. I decided to read it after my wife made me go see the movie. The movie hides all of the young teenage angst that is portrayed in these books. How many times will the main character go hide somewhere? It gets a little annoying by book 3. Anyway, it's a good read, good story, and has some good characters. It is disturbing, though, to read about kids killing themselves but the author seems to make it interesting without being too graphic.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|This was a not-so-subtle attempt to paint Margaret Thatcher as mentally ill while still in office.  This is not something that would make Margaret Thatcher proud.
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|This is a not very imaginative attempt to recreate Fernand Braudel's thirty-three year old thesis and it fails for basic lack of scholarship.  Not only do the authors appear unfamiliar with Braudel -- hard to get out of undergad without him -- but have never read Harold Innis, maybe the greatest economic historian of the twentieth century.  This is kind of like trying to figure out the origin of species without consulting Darwin.  Ouch!<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson make a vague attempt on the second last page -- 461, second paragraph -- to rescue the book, but they do not seem to understand what they have written there.  Innis would have started with this paragraph and worked forward for 462 pages.<br /><br />It would have been much easier to do as Sean White and I did twenty years ago in our first book, \\"Beating Japan.\\"  Draw from Innis and say simply that there is an information cost-velocity curve and that if you are on it you win and if you fall off it (or never get on) you lose, usually forever.  There is no case of anything that breaks this rule.  Winners are always further out on the curve than losers.  Darwin would have explained a set of organizational mutations governing this process (as Braudel so famously came close to doing) and Acemoglu and Robinson sort of try to do.<br /><br />The book's failure is a shame, because it focuses a lot the Revolution of 1688, the birth of the liberal movement and the information cost-velocity inflection point around which so much of our modern world turned, as Braudel was at pains to say time and again.  He went much further, however, and showed how the Ancien R&eacute;gime of Louis XIV failed to adjust, with the result that today, we all speak English and not French.<br /><br />We put it somewhat differently:  liberalism was the result of the British moving further out on the information cost-velocity curve than the French. The rest is history.  Today we say that only liberalism can flex with the rate of cloud inflation.  And that is what will doom China. And that is also why liberalism cannot be imposed.  It is a function of the curve -- the almost got it of page 461 -- and not the other way around.<br /><br />What the authors also fail to grapple with is the extraordinary success of the anti-liberal Mussolini model.  Regimes the world over from Russia and China to Venezuela and much of the Middle East use Mussolini's system to the letter.  Not for nothing Hitler called him a political genius.  They could simply have said, as we would, Mussolini only gets you so far out the curve before his model runs out of steam.  Whence China's conundrum.  And our foreign policy concerns there.<br /><br />A couple of copy editing bloopers.  \\"Systematized,\\" \\"Napoleon II\\" (poor chap never saw the light of day), \\"fear from change,\\" \\"quite regularly,\\" and my favorite \\"the Magna Carta.\\"And that is what will doom China.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Perfect for either the first or hundred and first reading of Sherlock Holmes.  I have been a fan of the greatest detective for many years and although I enjoy Sherlock's many adventures in the movies and on TV I always return to the original for a satisfying read.  A great addition for anyones library.
B001R6D7I8|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who is seeking to learn more about the Third Reich. It is also a vital example of \\"man's inhumanity to man,\\" the seeds of which lie in all of humanity.<br />The author has created a masterpiece and a classic in the genre.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|I am so very thrilled to have purchased this product--and at such a great price!  I think I'll need to order another set as I've watched each episode so many times that I know some of the dialogue!  The quality is excellent no matter which DVD player I use--regular or Blue Ray.  Now, the real question--when will Season 2 be available!?
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Works great. And love the features...almost no feature is missing.  Even better that it was free. Definitely a must have app for photo junkies.
B0058VW36U|4.0|this game is alright I suppose. it is very similar to where's my water in my opinion. all in all it is an okay game.
B000FV92K8|3.0|Writer/director Lawrence Kasden's take on the western legend known as WYATT EARP is a sprawling fictionalized biopic that has its strong points (well-defined characters, attention to detail, striking cinematography) and some weak ones (too much romance, an over three hour running time).<br /><br />Dennis Quaid went on a starvation diet prior to his Doc Holliday portrayal-- a highlight of this picture. Third-billed Gene Hackman as Wyatt's dad has a necessarily small role. Not one of Kevin Costner's better acting efforts. I've seen this one a few times and always come away from it with a feeling that something's missing. It's doubtful that elusive element would've been present had this been a six-hour TV miniseries, as originally planned.<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.5) Wyatt Earp (1994) - Kevin Costner/Dennis Quaid/Gene Hackman/Jeff Fahey/Mark Harmon/Michael Madsen/Catherine O'Hara/Bill Pullman/Isabella Rossellini/Tom Sizemore/JoBeth Williams/Mare Winningham/Adam Baldwin/James Gammon/Annabeth Gish/James Caviezel/T&eacute;a Leoni/Lawrence Kasden (uncredited cameo)
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Awesome hidden object game! Not so hard you get stuck but not so easy its over in an hour. I'm really enjoying it. I love that it was the free app of the day
B005LAIGLO|4.0|This is another great movie starring Mark Wahlberg.<br />At first glance I thought it was just another Gone In 60 Seconds but with smuggling instead of stealing cars.<br />Don't think the same thing I did. This was a suspenseful movie that looks great on Blu-Ray.<br />The deal didn't hurt either.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've used this app for a while and have found that it's improving all the time!  The developers truly want you to use it and enjoy it!  That speaks volumes to me!
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|This is the first in a series of three movies.  They were originally done in swedish.  But this version stars daniel craig and rooney mara.  I loved the fact you get the blu-ray, dvd and a digital copy.  I am not sold on the ultra-violet copy stuff.  It's not as convenient for me as the regular digital copies are.<br />I don't have super fast internet available to me where I live so it's nice to have it on my computer ready to load when I need it.<br />The blu-ray looks phenomenal and the dvd is nice to have for car trips.<br />I think this version is better than the original just because I don't need to read the subtitles.<br />But I think this version holds up just as well as the original version and is a great addition to anyones collection.
B00187MXA4|5.0|There is this feeling I get when I listen to SOAD or just Serj alone. . .I feel just. . .open. . .it's amazing.
B004LWZW88|4.0|With cartoon movies you always wonder if it's going to be something an adult can watch too.<br />Dreamworks did a great job with this movie.  They made it enjoyable for kids and adults.  The voiceovers are great and there aren't ridiculous puns thrown in all the time.<br />The adult humor is there and wil lgo over kids heads.<br />You can tell this is done by the same folks who have done the Shrek movies.  The story is well written and it mixes fairytales of old in a compelling story.<br />Don't be afraid to pick this up for the kids and yourself.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|great for my trolley rides!  the facebook popup is VERY annoying however. other than that, it's quite enjoyable. would recommend without a doubt.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|stupid after awhile some of the.games are hard and there are no untamed and all that sorry I'm just trying to get 250000 points
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game is one of the best game. G5 work very hard on this game. The color is nice and time is good for each have part.
B004LWZW7Y|1.0|The story line is not for young kids and not interesting for adults, it is creepy and dark. Did not enjoy at all.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was a great pick up especially if your sad about ending Fifty Shades of Grey! From start to finish it kept me involved ! To all those who hated it and wanted it more realistic...well maybe Fiction is the wrong department for you!! I loved this book!!
B007DA2FHG|5.0|Impressed with movie overall.  Good story-line and ending for a war movie.<br />I would recommend this movie to any movie-goer that enjoys happy endings.
0425263908|3.0|This book is a wannabe 50. There's lots of sex but somehow it comes off as crude. There's less character development and it's hard to embrace Gideon and Eva. There are many similarities, but it's just not as compelling.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Best Pumpkins release since 98!!  Love Violet Rays and Wildflower:)  I haven't really listened to much of their music in the past decade+.  This is actually a really good album to listen to if you want to get into them.  Enjoy:)
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was an original, refreshing take on history. Is it in any way accurate? Of course not. Too many critics are complaining that they did not stick with history or are ignoring history. Really? The film is called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter...Did you expect anything else.<br /><br />The story is the basic story of revenge. At a young age, Abe makes his first contact with vampires witnessing the death of a loved one. For years revenge stirs in his heart until finally he decides to do something about it. He confronts the vampire but quickly starts losing the fight until a vampire hunter saves him and sets his life path towards hunting vampires.<br /><br />The story is a simple tale of revenge with a heavy dose of blood and dead vampires. A little of history is sprinkled in with an original retelling of some of the great events in Lincoln's life and history in general.<br /><br />The actors/actresses in the film held their own. There aren't any academy awards in this movie but that isn't to say the acting was poor. It was sufficient for a dark vampire hunting movie.<br /><br />The special affects were enjoyable and well done.<br /><br />In the end this is a great summer movie that will entertain you. Those of you that are not obsessed with history and MUST have all historical portrayals be 100% accurate will indeed enjoy how history was re-imagined in the scope of Lincoln being a vampire hunter. As long as you accept that the premise of this story is ridiculous and do not expect this to closely resemble actual history, this movie will indeed entertain you.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|the only thing bad about this is u cant log in and out so if u lose ur phone or something then u have to start all over. plz fix this
B00121QGUY|5.0|I can watch this over and over again. I had to wait for it to come on tv until I finally bought it
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Well done author. The book was saucy yet written in a way that book was exciting to read. I read the other 2 books as well but by the third book christian is a bit overbearing but we all dream of having the christian in all manner in our lives. Looking forward to reading more books from this author. You certainly have Queensland, Australia talking about this book. Its all I am hearing at the moment which is how I got to know about them. And from some of radio reviews from women, their husbands are very impressed with the books read by the wives/partners/girlfriends.
B005LAIGIM|4.0|\\"My name is Jack McCall. I'd like to talk to you, but I can't because if I say just one more sentence out loud, I'll die.\\" Jack McCall (Murphy) works for a publishing firm and will do and say anything to close a deal. When he goes after the most sought after author, spiritual guru Dr. Sinja, he once again says anything that will get him to say yes. The Dr. sees through him and when Jack is at home that night he is shocked to see a tree pop out of the ground. After finding out that the tree loses a leaf every time Jack says a word he is forced to try and change the way he communicates. I have always been a big Eddie Murphy fan and I was looking forward to this one. I was surprised at how heartfelt and emotional this movie turned out to be. While this is a definite comedy and is very funny the real heart of the movie is the emotion that Murphy shows during his change. On that note, while I'm not saying this is an Oscar worthy performance this is his best acting since \\"Dreamgirls\\". Seems like just because it is a comedy the acting gets overlooked which isn't really fair. Murphy's performance was so perfect for this movie it took a movie that could have been very cheesy and fluffy and turned it into something so heartfelt and emotional that I actually got choked up a few times. For that to happen during a comedy is a testament to his acting. Overall, a very funny movie with a ton of heart that deserves to be seen. I really liked this one. I give it an A.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! I like the characters and different goals you can reach. It's a great app! I can't stop playing it!

1933784032|2.0|I bought this book for my husband as a gift. He loved it until it literally started falling apart in his hands. I checked with several book stores and found out it was a known problem. The book is hardcover with large pages and should have been stitched it was simply glued. Very disappointing.
0345529057|5.0|Great seller.  I received my books in just over a week, and that's to an APO address overseas.  Great series, very engrossing.  If you like the show, the books are even better!  Lots of action, great storyline and fantastic plot twists.
B004U52VPS|2.0|absolutely not worth the money; the catapult doesn't work well, the pieces are flimsy......better to build something with blocks and throw balls at it...save your money
0739352989|1.0|I, too, couldn't wait to read this series. Everyone I know is talking, texting, and FBing about it. What they didn't say is DON'T BUY THE AUDIOBOOK. I started listening today! The narrator is just awful!. She reads with a Valley Girl twist, but the worst part is she makes Christian Grey and all the men in the book sound like a Valley Boys!
B0086700CM|5.0|fun to play. the kids love it. it is addictive.  when you are sitting aroumd trying to kill time its fun
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I like hidden object games. they amuse me. game plays nicely on my R2D2 and my transformer. can even find things when drinking martinis.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome. I really loved playing and unlocking mini games to try to complete. overall I really enjoyed playing this game
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I was not sure how I would like this but it was free so I thought I would give it a try.  I am playing it on my Samsung. Charge &amp;  it works really well.  I can't. Wait to try it on the Kindle Fire.  I would pay for this app.  I love hidden object games.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a really fun app. Lots of free options for puzzle pictures. Never had any problems with the app running.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|So many options. Easy to use layout. My favorite photo editing app out of the 7 or so I have tried.
0345529057|5.0|I just finished the first book.  It was the best book I have read in years.  It was intriguing, suspenseful and absorbing.  I was spellbound and I could not put it down.  Each chapter is written from the viewpoint of a specific character and what is happening to them.  At times I could not wait to finish one chapter and find out what was happening with the next character and at times I was afraid of what was going to happen in the next chapter.  I highly recommend this series.<br />The qaulity of the book itself was good.  No problems of pages falling out or pages repeating.  I took this book to the pool and everywhere and it is still intact.  The four paperbacks for $20 is a fantastic price.  I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I do.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love this CD, it is certainly one of my absolute favorites!  Of course, I am just addicted to the Twilight series so listening to the music from one of the movies is so great!  I listen to this CD so much that my kids know all the words :)

B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a good looking and functional calculator.  The cost is only 99 cents and you get square root, Pi, square, and reciprocal function keys.  Very nice looking too.  You can also review the history of your calculations.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I went in not expecting much from this film, as I thought the trailer did a really awful job of telling us what exactly the film was even about, and the movie had also been getting very mixed reviews. I am so glad I gave this movie a chance because I loved it so much. The movie was funny and very emotional, and it has quickly became one of my favorite Pixar films.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved Tempel Run because its kind of like a logic game because you need to jump over the opsicals.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a rather enjoyable distraction when the gf starts talking too much, or I'm at work. :P only thing I don't like is how hard it is to get gold for free to get the really good stuff.. I'm poor and can't afford to pay for it D:
B00884GR0W|5.0|Does anyone know if this needs Internet? I want to buy it and be able to play it on long vacation drives and stuff like that... you know, so I'm not bored in the car. all in all, this sounds to be a good app...
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I am loving this series. I am half way through this book but I can't put it down! If you are into fantasy and love an epic tale then this is definitely the series for you!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Good app. Poor attention to detail i.e. the game wanted a flute you actually had to find a clarinet, or you.net to find digital things the game actually wanted a rotary phone.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Redshirts is an enjoyable, self-aware laughfest. It's sparely written and requires SOME knowledge of the lore of Star Trek. The tone is a bit Hollywood insider as shown in Agent to the Stars with some inklings of Heinlein-like universe creation and a hefty dose of Galaxy Quest panic. But this story is fresh and well carried by Ensign Dahl. The dialog has a bit of twee smarm, but the language used is effective and does much to maintain a pace that never lags. I found much to enjoy in Mr. Dill's interactions with the characters outside of his buddy group, especially the weary acceptance of the scripted obliviousness the bridge crew have to the nature of their universe. One thing I'll note with Mr. Scalzi's work is the completionist cant he takes where all loose ends are tied up nicely, and indeed I found that a bit jarring with the books in the Old Man's War universe, almost bordering on deus ex machina, but it FITS with Redshirts in the meta-awareness provided, and indeed would be required if one adds the final matryoshka-like wrap with Scalzi himself, the creater of it all.
0345803485|3.0|This book is definitely entertaining and it certainly holds your attention.  Its worth the money and worth the time if you read for entertainment, not always to experience literary greatness.  While I want to know how the whole trilogy concludes, I almost don't want to bother reading the second two books, I'd rather ask someone than subject myself to more of the same.  Not because it wasn't good, but there's only so many love scenes between the same two characters that I can wade through.<br /><br />The multiple references to 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles ' peaked my interest in the story and I downloaded the audiobook from LibriVox (it is free there.)  It was completely engrossing.  I recommend it as a follow-up activity to 50 Shades.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been very pleased with this app on my KindleFire.  The Graphics are great and the maps work efficiently.  I used AccuWeather on my phone previously and have been waiting to get it for my Kindlefire. I am not dissapointed.

0345803485|1.0|My girlfriends are raving about this book, and I'm deep in graduate school so I thought, I could use a nice non-education read.... but WHAT THE ....<br /><br />I have only read about 11 chapters and I can't take it anymore!! The book is so terrible it's actually starting making me angry! I have no issues with the subject matter, that's the only mildly exciting part of the book - BUT THE WRITING IS SO BAD!!!<br /><br />Our main character is 21 and he is 27, (as as a 29 y/o reader), I actually have trouble with these ages, does no one else have a problem with this? - they are far too young to be in the roles and situations they are. It is 'Sex and the City' type material and she's just graduating college? I have trouble picturing it without feeling creepy. And she even puts her hair in PIGTAILS their first \\"morning after\\" together. I actually cringed when I read it!!<br /><br />I'm so distracted by her \\"oh my\\" after everything that happens, and someone who constantly re-uses the same phrases over and over and OVER, and can only describe someone as \\"so freaking hot\\" - it sets off a big alarm in my head the BIG $2 WORDS planted all over the novel and in dialogue. I would bet money on it that the author thesaurus looked up every freaking big word in this book. As a big reader, I was constantly stopped by these words that are so obviously implanted in crappy writing.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|thank you so much for giving us a wonderful FAOTD. :) sometimes you get it spot on. Please, could we have more of these quality apps daily? its a wonderful surprise every morning.
B000000OPU|5.0|I think many people would say that So is his best work ever but would not necessarily call it my favorite.  Yet most of his fans would probably agree it was the album that shot his career to superstar status.  It does have my favorite song of his for 'in your eyes' and one maybe of his smaller popular songs 'this is the picture', which I also enjoy, along with 'mercy street', being my favorites.  A great album nonetheless and a must have for any fan of his.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got it for free and it didn't dissapoint. I definetly wouldn't spend the full price on it though. since we don't have instagram on here this is the next best thing
0812973992|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It came across as a creative writing assignment rather than a finished, polished novel. I was shocked to see Frank McCourt had given a blurb for this. The characters are loose and unrelated, and yet somehow the author has tried to tie these together as if it is a compelling story. The first part of the story seems like the one the author wanted to write, but it's like he gave up and couldn't get more out of the characters, so he made up a few random stories and tied them together. If this book did have a purpose, it's lost on the reader. Save your money and skip this one.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I like hidden object games and this one is pretty good. I am playing it on the Kindle Fire and some of the screens are dark so I turn up the brightness and that helps in finding the hidden objects. I also like it that you can zoom in and see small details that you would miss without this feature.<br /><br />With 50 levels this will keep me busy for a while. There are mini-games and hidden object challenges to mix up the game play to keep it interesting. The graphics are well done and that makes the game more fun but some of the screens are rather cluttered with objects. That makes you really have to look for some of them as that are well disguised or hidden.<br /><br />Someone commented that you have to enter your Facebook data to play but I just didn't do it and kept on playing. I like this game but it is rather large at 82.83 MB so after I beat it I`ll probably store it in the cloud until I want to play it again. If you like hidden object games then you will like this one.
B007MAETA8|3.0|Dear John,<br />  This is the first album of yours that I could listen to all the way through. The style of music and the un affected vocals sure did help. This sure sounds remotely like L.A. Country-Rock-Pop laid back music to me. I dug it then and I admire your attempted recreation. You are extremely talented, no doubt, and my only wish for you is that you will find something that can be called distinctly John Mayer Music---an identity,as it were. As was said about another musician-guitarist that appeared in the SNL Band years ago--\\"He can play anything, but he feels nothing\\". One cannot give what one does not have. Good luck.
B007SNMVH2|5.0|Aside from the movie being great, the quality of the film was excellent. I have never rented a movie from Amazon on demand and had a bad experience.
B003G4W49C|4.0|My son (now 31) has said this book is one of his all time favorites since he first read it in middle school, so I finally bought it for my Kindle. We agree that this volume should become a leadership handbook on how to develop a loyal team. Additionally, it is a study in how a person becomes almost inhumanly efficient and successful, but still maintains his humanity. It is disturbing to think young children are capable of so much complex thought and violence. It is even more disturbing how \\"the powers that be\\" use and abuse these children, even if it is for the supposed greater good. The ending was amazing, unexpected, and a little anticlimatic. I believe that highly intelligent youth would enjoy reading this story, imagining themselves with these challenges and what they would do. Adults should read this to understand there is more going on in their child's mind than fun and games. I realize that this story is very important to my highly intelligent child, who is reading it again as he moves into management.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I downloaded this game first thing after I got my Kindle Fire. It's amusing, makes you think, and gives you great value in the length of play time!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|not many hidden object games get my approval but this one is great...it also has a good storyline to it
B005LY4B0A|4.0|This game starts out easy but ends up very challenging pretty quickly. It is easy to qrasp for a younger crowd but gets harder almost instantly for adults. My 5 yr old loves to play it and so do I. Love this game.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|For this being my first book online,  WOW!  The books were great! A pleasant way to put some spice back into a marriage!  You don't have to be in your 20's or 30's either!
0316023744|5.0|In this huge volume containing 800 pages of written text, Antony Beevor has tried to do the impossible. He has managed to cover almost all the aspects of World War Two-the most horrible conflict mankind has ever known.More than seventy million people perished in it. This is not only a military history but also a political one. The majority of it covers the Eastern Front and the rest describes the war in the Pacific Theatre.<br />This book is a synthesis of many and previous works on the subject and its strength lies in its excellent chapters-50 only. Each one tells the reader about another aspect of the war.<br />There are very good chapters on the Battle of Stalingrad, Pearl Harbour, the Japanese occupation and the Battle of Midway, as well as the Battle of Kursk and the Battle of Berlin.<br />Beevor is excellent when he writes about the horrors of this conflict, especially during the Leningrad Siege or when he describes in what way the Japanese were engaged in barbaric acts. He writes, for example, about the Japanese soldiers and officers who resorted to cannibalism and not just of enemy corpses. He adds that \\"human flesh was regarded as a necessary food source, and hunting parties were forth to obtain it. In New Guinea they killed, butchered and ate local people and slave laborers, as well as a number of Australian and American prisoners of war, whom they referred to as 'white pigs', as opposed to  Asian 'black pigs'.<br />His main source and companion when writing about the Eastern Front is Vasily Grossman. The Holocaust gets vey little attention and he does barely mention Ultra's role in the war.<br />Another excellent point is when Beevor discusses the talks that the Big Three had during the war: Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. Stalin's paranoia is evident everywhere and the fact that he had more than 80 warnings about the Nazis' intentions but dismissed them as fabrications of the mind only proves this point. Beevor is excellent when describing the strategies of Stalin's generals.<br />The weak points of this book are as follows: there are not many maps in it. In a military history book, the editors had to incorporate a greater number of them. Second, too much attention is given to Europe but not to other parts of of this conflict. Third, the ordinary lives of the combatants and civilians alike gets attention only when he describes the events in Europe but not in the Far East.<br />However, this book is extremely well-written, engrossing and nicely produced. Highly recommended!
B0064MT1FI|5.0|SERIOUSLY?!  This is one of the most interesting, beautiful, 'out -of- the ordinary' love stories...and the star ratings are this low?<br />Does anyone on this comment panel have any idea what a GREAT movie should be like...I think people who gave this movie any less than 4 stars should stick to watching meaningless movies with car chases and gun fights!  Really sad to see that people have no appreciation for what is really good!
0345803485|5.0|I found this book very intriging.  I couldn't put the book down and couldn't wait to read book2 and book3 and wish there was a fourth book.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is a very easy to use app, and has lots of options to choose from. This is one of my top 3 apps I used for pictures. Glade I got it when it was FREE!!!

B00005JPD0|1.0|Apparently, Tony Scott isn't much of a director.  In this movie, all that matters are the special effects.  CGI must reign supreme over script, storyline, continuity, and semi-reality.  The movie itself is quite a mess.  How can I count the ways?<br /><br />First of all, the chase scenes are not suspenseful at all.  No character development left me not caring about any of the characters, particularly Denzel's character.  I saw no point in the movie for Val Kilmer's character.  His reason for being in the movie defies explanation.  Bruce Greenwood is only in the movie for 5 minutes or less and his character is also pointless.<br /><br />Secondly, the autopsy scene: there is NO WAY in the world the dead woman would look that good after washing up on the beach.  She was still wearing mascara, nothing was wrong with her face, eyes.  Unbelieveable when the filmmakers go to no effort to make her look like a corpse.  Completely stupid scene.<br /><br />Third, Denzel's character runs around town supposedly \\"chasing\\" the bad guy but not really!?!  That is about the gist of the whole plot and it is not interesting enough to watch for two hours or more.  There seems to be no compelling reason for anything, including going back in time.  The real turkey is when, of course very predictably, Denzel cannot save his partner's life, but the girl he is lusting after -- she gets saved via his time travel.  It is a tired plot line that dragged on endlessly.  Then, when the bag is removed from the girl's face, she should have been in shock, but she \\"recovered\\" after less than 5 minutes.  Unrealistic, just like every other scene in this film.<br /><br />Fourth and finally, I enjoyed Jim Caviziel as a murderer but not in the end scene when he was on the ferry.  At that point, when he saw that lady again, (and if this movie had even a grain of realistic storyline in it) he would have shot her and been done with it.  There was NO REASON whatsoever to tie her up, put her in the SUV, and leave the keys in the ignition so that she could run over him.  How stupid, contrived and unimaginative was that plot hole?  Viewers of action movies want at least SOME dose of common sense and the ending to this movie was extremely lame.<br /><br />Skip this one.  Denzel has made some turkeys in the last few years, but this one gobbles worse than most!  If you want to see a good Denzel movie, I would recommend \\"Man on Fire.\\"

0985081821|4.0|The paperback version had been in my cart for a few weeks, but on a whim I decided to go ahead and download the kindle version because it was cheaper. I prefer physically possessing a book and having it on my bookshelf, but I couldn't wait any longer.<br /><br />The story wasn't what I expected, but it still had me reading all day. It has been a month or so since I was able to enjoy a book so thoroughly.

0345803485|1.0|So like most of you I wanted to see what the hub bub was all about with this 50 Shade hoopla. I got the book and I'm about 10 chapters in. *sighs* I'm disappointed in myself people. First of all, its like watching a train wreck, I just can't look away. Seriously. *Taps chin* Where to begin. How about Chapter One. Basic writing 101, give me a little background on your heroine. I want to know about her, what she likes, and doesn't like. I want to like her as I get to know her. All I got in Chapter One, was that she doesn't want to do this interview with Christian and she feels, \\"forced\\" into doing it by her demanding best friend. *sighs* She trips over herself, she bites her lip, she blushes, she mumbles, stumbles, and stammers like a love sick teenager. Hmmm, I'm seeing similarities here, are you? Christian to me looks like Edward, with his unruly crop of hair and she reminds me of Bella with her errant hair and converse shoes. Instead of driving a '53 Ford pick up, Ana drives a 73 beetle. Yes, a bug.<br /><br />But, it gets worse.<br /><br />She's a virgin. Okay that's fine. She's never touched herself...huh? Okay I can understand if she was just awkward...wait she is...crap. Okay, let me rephrase that, really...REALLY? She never touched herself...Oh, I see your nose growing, Miss Steele. But, whatever. So now that she's slept with him, not touched him, but slept with him, because she was drunk, she wants to know him more. He could be the one. *rolls eyes* So much so she uses his toothbrush! EW!!!<br /><br />Let's fast forward.<br /><br />After a helicopter ride to his apartment, he basically drops in her lap, he's a Dominant. He shows her his playroom, okay. But she's never showed a kink and she's willing to give it a try and signs a contract. DO YOU SEE THE ISSUES HERE?? I mean there is nothing wrong with a healthy BDSM lifestyle. But both parties know what they're getting into. They both have a little experience in it OR at least know they want to experiment. Where is your set up Mrs. James? Where do you show she has a kinky side? So far, she's never even said she likes guys, although she says something like he makes her tingle. Well if I stick a paper clip into a socket, I'd tingle too. But, that's besides the point. How do you put such an innocent girl into this situation and think its glamorous or hot, or erotic? It's not. I'm serious. Even when you have her in the play room, she doesn't say how it makes her feel. It's like she's a robot. Not believable.<br /><br />I guess it doesn't matter though, because she does the deed...<br /><br />SHE HAS SEX! Mind numbing, make you groan and squirm SEX! And it's not because its good sex or great sex, its teenager sex!!! YES, I said it. I'll say it again. IT'S TEEN SEX. I know not every sex scene written will be mind blowing, but come on...COME ON! Where was your editor, why wasn't someone sitting there slapping your hands saying, STOP IT. I mean she have sex for the first time. Okay, cool. She orgasms at the drop of a hat, then when it's over....thankfully, SHE WANTS IT AGAIN!!! So, does our hero clean up, then slide a 'fresh' condom on? Nope, he just slaps another one on and goes to town...um, again, EW!!!<br /><br />So like I said I'm almost to Chapter Ten, the grammar is worse than the story. FYI: Break apart your dialogue. It's why you see really good authors doing it. It's how it's supposed to be. I keep waiting for the names to change from Christian and Ana, to Edward and Bella. If I have to see her bite her lip, or read \\"I'm going to bite that lip.\\" I'm going to hurl. If I have to read, \\"there's something about an elevator,\\" I'm going to cut the cables and watch the car fall from the top floor of the apartment and not feel bad.<br /><br />This is just a poorly written book, with little to no editing...I'm betting no editing if I'm being honest here. I'm also betting whoever said this was good and you should publish it, was probably a good friend or a family member. Had this been published through a great publisher, there would have been several rewrites, grammar fixes galore, and a couple of, well more than a couple of; you got to be kidding me!! Anyone who likes this book should really question why and while you're at it, show me where it's good. I'm serious, I want to see it. I want to be proven wrong.<br /><br />Will I finish reading it, probably. I'm a sadist at heart. Mrs. James, if you're reading this, that means I like pain. Ie, your book causes me pain. But it is a train wreck and I can't look away. I'll keep you posted peeps.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona-- thank you for singing to my soul yet again.  I knew that this new album would take a few listens, and now I cannot get it out of my head.  That's the beauty of your work, it is always predictably unpredictable and burns vivid imprints into the willing minds.  \\"Every Single Night\\" is still my favorite, but probably only because I listened to that song almost non-stop waiting for the rest of the album.  If it's like your other releases, every song on this album will eventually become a favorite.  I have to admit that deep down I was wishing for something that sounded like \\"When the Pawn\\", but I get it and I appreciate the bravery that compelled you to distill these songs into what they are.  I've been a huge fan since the first time that I heard Shadowboxer, and I can't even put into words the effect that your music has had upon me.  If I could put my arms entirely around it, I probably wouldn't ever let it go.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought it was a fun read and I couldn't put it down.  As you make your way through the triliogy it becomes less shoking and more about the caring relationship of two people, one of whom who has been emotionally and physically scared from childhood.  Would enjoy reading a fourth book!

Don't be expected to be blown away by stellar performances or academy award nominations, though.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Love the game, but the UPGRADE popup is quite annoying.  I PURCHASED the upgrade, and NOTHING changed with my game.  I figure if everyone purchases this $1.99 upgrade and gets nothing, wow .. they're making millions off of us for nothing!  I still have the ads, I still have the same words over and over, and I still have no bonus coins and/or bombs referred to in the Upgrade Ad ... aside from that, lots of fun!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Just finished this excellent book. Walter Isaacson deserves a great deal of credit for his fair and thorough writing. And Steve Jobs deserves our gratitude for allowing Walter to tell us the whole unvarnished truth.<br />In reading this book you will come to understand the dynamics of ultrabig business dealings, the interpersonal aspects of Silicon Valley culture and how Steve Jobs was able to revolutionize our world.<br />He did to technology what Walt Disney did to entertainment. Yes, he was MUCH less lovable than Walt, but still, the lovable parts of Steve were there and his focus and drive served all of us well.<br />Read this book, you will be more intelligent just by reading it.<br />Jim Cathcart<br />[[ASIN:B004AYD92S Relationship Selling: The eight competencies of top sales producers]]
B004EWFV9K|3.0|This, the last Kurt Wallander book has a little of everything: people disappearing only to reappear, Russian, Swedish and American spies; a murdered real-life prime minister; thorny family relationships; submarines, exotic poisons, babies; a 35 year-old woman locked away in an institution for life unknown to her sibling; Wallander now lives in the country but keeps his dog locked-up in a kennel; Kurt gets beat-up by some young toughs; he leaves his gun in a bar; he is also gradually losing his memory. The love of his life, the lady from Latvia gets cancer and dies in a car wreck. Every trip to the store and every walk in the woods is minutely described but has little to do with moving the plot--the plot, by the way, moves as slow as a slug oozing across a corn field in August.<br /><br />The book is carelessly stitched together--if this were the first Wallander book I read, I'd never read another. Still, I didn't put it down, I have followed and enjoyed the whole Wallander series and I would see him to the end: ends are usually messy and this is no exception. Kurt is only 60 (I'm nearly 80) and his decline is sad and awful--I hope Mankell is in better shape.
B00782O7NE|5.0|I had the great pleasure of screening this film at last year's Virginia Film Festival.  Be prepared for an irony free zone, as this film works beautifully within the sensibility of how such a work might have been shot in 1928. The cinematography is absolutely exquisite, and shows how utterly beautiful black and white can be.  My hope is that this masterpiece can open up the worlds of silent and black and white film for a brand new audience.  If this film appeals, I highly recommend F.W. Murnau's \\"Sunrise,\\" a European film shot in Hollywood. Won a first ever Best Actress Oscar, awarded to Janet Gaynor, who also won that year for \\"7th Heaven.\\"
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|its really fun and a great focus game and there are different parts of a level and you can make the screen bigger or smaller but I play it because I love hidden object games
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I've listened to Leonard's \\"Old Ideas\\" for quite a few months, finding new things to absorb or contemplate with each new listening. His music is a different kind of music, in case you ask my opinion. Always has been. It's not meant for dancing or as background humming to your daily blahs. In his music, the emphasis is on the lyrics, with something melodic and rhythmically catchy to carry your attention along to wherever it ends.<br /><br />He's writing for (and always has written for) what we used to call \\"the old souls.\\" Nowadays some of us are actually old in years as well. We don't have many contemporaries writing the deeper currents of what it's like to be staring into the depths from this vantage point in time.<br /><br />It takes a lyrical voice, not a prosaic voice, for us to make out these kinds of truths, and Leonard has it.<br /><br />He likes to play with words, and it's meant to be fun; so enjoy it if you can. Some of the pieces on this recording are mainly that: using words in fun explorations of even the darkness. But, as in his earlier works, when he gets down to speaking the bones his eloquence finds a grace that is fortunately contagious. Working in the same vein as many mystics - say, perhaps, Rumi - when he speaks of a beloved (a lover), you know he's speaking of more than a person.<br /><br />Leonard never preaches or shows off - he's that good - but for me there's a grace and kindness coming through his music that makes life a whole lot easier to handle.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I played this on my KF with no issues. Storyline was good, graphics were as well. I don't normally play this type of HO game.

1451648537|5.0|I spent so much of this book vacillating between being aghast at what a jerk Jobs was to so many around him,and yet being blown away by his visionary leadership I found it hard to put down. Frankly the biggest surprise was how moved I was by the time I reached the end of the book and his death. It's exhaustively researched, and so utterly fascinating, despite the fact his behavior was simply appalling much of the time, I found myself reading passages aloud to people so we could all shake our heads in disbelief, and yet there's no denying the guy was brilliant.

B000HSIEPI|5.0|I love this series, but Urquhart was so sinister that the actor(Ian Richardson) did not want to continue to play his part.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Never before have I read a book that didn't contain atleast one character that I liked or could get attached to in some kind of way.  I disliked every character and it made it really hard for me to care about the story or it's outcome.  The first half of the book moves pretty slow and at some point I just wanted to stop but because I had paid $12.99 for it I felt compelled to keep reading.  The story definitely picks up after the halfway point and there are some decent twists and surprises in the stroy line but again the characters were so unlkeable I didn't really care.  I felt like after suffering through the story the author could have atleast given a strong finish...but no, the end was horrible and I wish I could back the time I wasted reading this book.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book pulled me in form the start and i read it in one sitting because i just wanted to know how the story ended

0425263908|2.0|I felt this entire books happenings came right from 50 Shades of Grey, but without substance!!  The initial meeting in both books is a fall, there are connections at work, they both go to a formal event at the parents house...really??!!  And the sex scenes lacked emotion and used both \\"C\\" words...not needed.  Although I wonder what will become of the main characters I don't think I can make it through the sequel.

0525478817|5.0|I could not decide if I was to old to love this book the way I did. As I read the book I thought to myself that I'm glad I stumbled upon it in my mid twenties and not mid-teens. To laugh and cry at the exact time is truly a rare form of art that John Green  has gifted upon all of us in This Fault in Our Stars. The characters are flawless, their humor noteworthy but the connection you feel will become heart wrenching. My recommendation is to sit down for a full 24 hours and fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters all at once. Truly delighted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great way to escape and pass time. I like how most of the games are about two minutes long. That way I don't get sucked into a virtual world for hours on end. And there are so many options to play.
B007HJ84WS|4.0|Not to often a storyline has a decent  start, middle and end. that seems to tye up most loose ends. the 3d imagery is grand the Nasty creatures ugly and real enough to pop a bowl of popcorn, and enjoy an epic adventure.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this game isn't bad but its wasn't my favorite, its a really good time waster.  if you like hidden objects kind of games I would recommend getting this game,  you would really like it :)
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I really enjoyed this 2nd book in the Clifton Chronicles series - don't know if I can wait a whole year for the next one to be issued.  The characters are great, the suspense is gripping.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is awesome, cool, a little bit violent, not for kids, free, addictive, cool cool cool cool cool cool........
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I bought this a few months ago and it worked well at first but then it just quit working. The feed was patchy and caused my monitor to flash and blink practically inducing seizures. At first I thought it was the monitor, because this adapter was so new, but I had the monitor looked at and it turns out...it was the adapter all along. Yikes what a waste of time and money...Can I get my 30 bucks back Moshi? Stop making electronics that don't work! I understand planned obsolescence but really???
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|No money, no trash, excellent seek out items game. Graphics are great and the music is good too. works great on my HP tablet running Android ice cream!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is kick Burt you should get it. it is free and totally addicting so yeah definitly a good idea.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great finish for the trilogy.  Loved the different Point of view at the end of the book.  I enjoyed the series.
B007L5KT76|5.0|For the life of me i cannot understand the bad reviews!! If its an issue with the making of the DVD, fine, state that but the movie itself is excellent! Its witty, exciting, brimming with sit on the edge of your seat intrigue and the cast is beyond fantastic. I loved this movie and would watch it again and again. Just as good if not better than the first!
B007MAETA8|3.0|I must admit I've only been through the album twice so far, but I have such a deja vu feeling when I listen to it.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great album, I'm sure it will be in rotation on my ipod for a while, but I feel like these melodies, especially some of the intros, are just really similar to other songs out there.  I miss the more intricate lyrics and truly unique songs on continuum and his earlier albums.  These songs may be good, but they're terribly simple at times.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|lvl 3 so far; decent story, nice variety with word list or item outline of objects to find. controls are intuitive. good finder game
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Fun time waster for those dull moments at work. The storyline is a nice way to draw the puzzles together with specific goals.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I need to reach out and share how, even days later, this book has gripped my heart and gotten inside me. I've been thinking about it all weekend, immersing myself in every little tidbit posted on the author's blog ([...]), and just generally daydreaming about it. It's the type of story that gets inside you and really makes you hope and dream, and THINK.<br /><br />Filled with words of love, some amazing poems that have been playing like \\"earworms\\" inside my head, and just a story that brings you to your knees, I can't help but HIGHLY recommend Slammed to everyone I know. I don't think it would matter if you're a romantic or pragmatist, or anything in between, you will be touched by this story and the tale Colleen has woven. From start to finish (and into it's sequel, Point of Retreat) this is one book I will be reading over and over again.<br /><br />Colleen, you are an amazing talent, and I know I'll be following you for years to come.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Whether or not you like this movie seems to boil down to whether or not you can accept that the crew of  a trillion dollar expedition consisting, one would hope, of the future's brightest and best would actually contain so many unlikeable morons who make so many moronic decisions for whatever moronic reasons  and are funded by someone who looks like old Biff in Back To The Future 2! You can chose to believe that the plot holes will be explained in a sequel but that in no way is an excuse for the total absence of sympathetic or believable characters in this particular film. Other reviewers have covered in great detail the obvious weaknesses of the plot. For me, one example of the weakness of the scriptwriting is demonstrated by the three crew members sacrificing themselves to - we can only hope - save humanity near the end of the movie. Their actions would have had a greater impact.... no make that their actions would at least have had an impact if we knew enough about these individuals to care about them! Three stars for the visual elements if you can separate that from the weak script propelled by the moronic actions of the moronic crew members.
143911000X|5.0|It's worth for the laughs, and the mostly oddly accurate information, definitively worth getting and passing around to friends. But I might be terribly biased toward Neil/Barney.
B005LAIHZE|3.0|Finally something unique in theaters. No remake, sequel or board game based movie here. I read the book over a year ago and really enjoyed it, but the movie was a mixed bag. The concept is cool if you don't mind history being messed with in a big way, the acting was solid (though I thought the guy paying Lincoln was a bit boring at times), the CGI was more hit than miss, there were some good and gory fight scenes and the sets/atmosphere was good enough.<br /><br />I really thought they rushed through it. The editing could have used some work, like towards the end it goes from Lincoln starting his career in politics to being the president in the next scene. Maybe a longer cut will be available in the future.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was fun to watch and is worth checking out on Blu-ray, but I had higher hopes given the source material.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing what Daniel Day-Lewis does with the historical version of Lincoln's life later this year. Maybe he will even pick up a third Oscar for his efforts.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|The game is fair to good.  I definitely did not like the background music.  Worth downloading especially since its free.
0071762345|5.0|This is a great book that discusses how to use social media to help delight customers and enhance your brand's image.  Those already familiar with the social media space might not find any earth-shattering revelations, but the author discusses many nuances and intricacies that they might not have realized before.  I, for one, learned some things about how Facebook chooses what to put on my Top Stories feed and after reading the section on Facebook advertising, I went online to explore and am astonished at just how finely Facebook ads can be targeted to one's market.  Even if you don't take away anything earth shattering you will probably enjoy and appreciate the way the author covers the topic and you'll probably gain some insights from the case studies and specific examples.<br /><br />The book primarily talks about social media as applied to Facebook (which is, of course, valid since Facebook is the 800 pound gorilla) but he also talks about Twitter, YouTube, and some other social media along the way.  The principles discussed, however, apply to any social media channel out there.  Just be warned that you should not look to this book as a \\"how to\\" book on advertising on social media.  The title of the book, after all, talks about being \\"likeable\\" which accurately connotes how to use social media to shape the image of your brand in customers' eyes, not how to hard sell them through advertising.  That is the whole point of the book, in my opinion.  Engaging in social media is a brand building exercise and not a hard sell when done properly.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to just about anyone who engages in social media or any marketer who is using or thinking about using social media to help build their brand.  The book covers the topic in approachable fashion and the reading is enjoyable.<br /><br />~~Review by the author of the e-book, \\"How to Build and Manage Your Brand: In sickness and in health.\\"
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|great game and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to find hidden objects! I also live how it deals with paranormal activity.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This game could be better if the games weren't for such little kids. It doesn't have and problems but overall a great kids game.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I had to bring it to best buy and start all over again this is my 5 one because that when they told me that this app was the problem.it works.at first. but BOOM
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this game is amazing! its so addictive and its somewhat like a detective game ! you search for items; and solve little puzzles and mini games!  this is such a cool game!  everyone should buy it and I got it as free app of the day which is even better! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series was a great read!!!!  The book had me laughing, crying and left me feeling great. I would recommend this series to any one that i looking for a good romance with a great twist of kink with their vanilla.

B003O86FMW|5.0|After \\"The Hunger Games\\" my hunger was for MORE, and it really came with \\"Catching Fire\\". Very good ambientation, better introduction to the new arena and wonderful ending for this saga. I'm already reading the third and last book.<br />Thank you so much Suzanne for filling some of my idle time with such a pleasant reading. Go for more!!!
B00821OW8K|5.0|I was anxious to see this and was amazed at the production in a thrilling fight for survival as the aliens want to take over. Thrilling and Chilling from start to finish without one dull moment. Intense suspense throughout as it makes you crave for more. Superb acting performance in an unforgettable thriller aimed to please. Be prepared, edge-of-your-seat thrills and action-packed. Highly Recommended!
1609611543|5.0|Great information in this book.  Worth reading and making changes in your diet.  You will not want to eat wheat after reading this book.  It gives pratical information and the understanding of what wheat and gluten can do to your body.  I would recommend to anyone looking to making healthy changes.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds me so much of the first time i got Mario bros! flashback and you don't have to blow into the cartridge for the game to work! lol.<br />I love it.
0345803485|5.0|Best book I read so far, very interranig, love all the characters, especially the main characters.<br />This is a must read book..
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have enjoyed this game very much, I do wish it had options to add 2 , 3 or 4 suits.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Have this turntable for a couple months. It works pretty well. I give it 4-star because of its inexpensive price tag. Also, it sounds as good as my previous more expensive turntable. However, I do wish the RCA cable is detachable and I can replace it with a higher quality one.
B0080R7P8A|5.0|Can have done it again, somehow this band are able to construct and release nearly 3 hours of the funkiest experimental rock ever. Lost Tapes (a 3 c.d. box set) is definately up to the standards of 'Unlimited Edition\\" (a dbl album of outtakes released in 1976) & it is definately a must have for all Can fans & anyone who loves excellent music whether its rock, electronic, world, funk, or classical.<br />The songs are collated from their peak era 1968-1977 & are mostly chronologically organised. Which is by far the best & most effective manner to document a seminal and groundbreaking band's musical evolution. Pink Floyd had a best of several years ago & the songs were all over the place chronologically & the net result was both annoying & absolutely made no sense. Can's presentation follows the 1st 3 peak eras namely the late 60's with M. Mooney an era of confrontational aggressive repetitive music similar perhaps to the Velvet Undergound at their peak playing Stockhausen music. The 2nd era was from '70 to '73 with Japanese vocalist Damo Suzuki on board. This era generated 2 of the finest albums in music history namely the dbl 1971 masterpiece Tago Mago (an unpredictable experimental gothic voodoo music alchemy) & the brilliant futuristic ambience of Future Days. The 3rd peak era was 1974-'77 when all the band were still partipating & still very willing to break & create new musical boundaries. That Lost Tapes represents each period so fittingly with so many never before heard songs is relavatory & an absolute essential addition to the the Can musical legacy.<br />However, the first listener to Can would be better off listening to 'Monster Movie'(1969)'Tago Mago'(1971),'Ege Bamyashi'(1972),'Future Days'(1973), or 'Soon over Babaluma'(1974), as these albums are their most inspired and refined. 'Lost Tapes' comes with a great informative booklet, with heaps of studio & band photos & it makes me wonder how is it Can can go to their archives & release outakes from 35-40 years ago that out rock/out experiment/out funk anything released in the last 10 years.<br />ViVa Can forever... :) >< 1,000,000,000
B008DB3N5W|1.0|First a little backstory, I used to be one of the \\"die-hard fans\\" , been following this band for 30 yrs,still have Joey's bass pick that he personally handed to me back in 88' at a club in Bayshore NY after driving 4 hrs to see them. Triumph of Steel was the last really GOOD Manowar album, everything since has been somewhere between disappointing to fair at best, then after another ridiculous 6 yr wait here it is, and wow , I mean WOW! I was fully prepared for disappointment but not the outright slap in the face that this album is.<br />This is so bad it almost seems like a bad inside joke is being perpetrated on the fans, it seems like more of a spoof than anything put out by spoof bands such as Spinal Tap, Steel panther, or Tenacious D, I am being serious, any album by those bands seems almost \\"Shakespearean\\" compared to this.<br />First, let's address the 800lb gorilla in the room- the HORRENDOUS production, this is not only the worst production on a Manowar album but may go down in the annals of metal history as one of the worst productions ever, even the few good tracks on here, such as the title track, are rendered almost unlistenable by the horrendous annnoying bass buzz that sounds like a blown speaker  and permeates every track on the album, why Joey seemed to think this would sound \\"cool\\" is beyond me.Then Joey made a big hoopla over the return of drummer Donny Hamzik, yet most tracks sound like programmed drums, and if they aren't programmed then they went out of thier way to make real drums sound like programmed drums. Guitar solos-:lousy, misplaced, and without cohesion. Lyrics: for a band that has been routinely ridiculed for being cheesy over the years, it's almost as if they went out of their way to be \\"extra cheesy\\" on this album, seriously, Wisconsin hasn't produced this much cheese in the last 6 yrs.<br />Even the musical compositions are tired , boring, cliche' and without a single ounce of creativity.<br />It would be too easy to say that because the band has been around for 30 yrs that they are creatively \\"spent\\" , because Accept which has been around even longer has just put out back-to-back the two best albums of their career, and Overkill,Exodus and Riot have also been putting out some of the best material of their careers. Nope, this is just plain INEXCUSABLE folks. Anyone defending this album is like a religious zealot who refuses to believe what his own eyes and ears are telling him. This album is one of the biggest turd sandwiches that a band has ever served to it's fans.<br /><br />addendum: I just relistened to this several times and played it back to back with  \\"Gods of War\\", and the much derided GoW seems like an outright masterpiece in comparison, at least they were trying to evolve on that album, it just needed less narration and more balls-out uptempo numbers, LoS on the other hand represents a devolvement and has only ONE truly uptempo track on the whole album,the rest are just plodding mid-tempo numbers and ineffective semi-ballads. If possible, Manowar need to go in and adjust the bass sound on the masters before the hard copy CDs get released, that is truly the most off-putting aspect of this album that renders even the tolerable songs unlistenable, .. even that would only bring this album up to \\"tolerably mediocre\\" and 2.5 stars versus the outright atrocity it is in it's current form.

B0086700CM|5.0|it so fun to play.  u should get it. it is the bomb. it has different people. jungle like there's monkey's that try to get u .it is one of my favoriet games.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Kind of enjoying getting lost in basic &quot;find the missing objects&quot; part of this game, but still not certain if it's going to let me have something more interesting to do (or would one be required to interface with<br />their facebook page at the 'tap to continue' prompt for this to really be a game!?) Time will tell I guess.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|For all you Ray Charles lovers out there...this CD is a must! Oh, it came a lot quicker than was expected, too!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you have NEVER read any erotic thrillers then you will LOVE LOVE this book, if you have read several erotic thrillers like myself then you will think the book is just OK.  There is a lot of SEX going on in this book, but it lacks an actual plot.  Just when you think something juicy is going to happen (a plot), then they start having SEX again and the plot/climax just dies away.  I can tell you that you will NOT get a concrete ending to the first book or second book.  The 3rd book will give you a final ending.  I am on the 3rd book, merely b/c i just want to find out how this cherades is going to end.  Otherwise, it was good read and the main character is pretty intriguing.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I don't like how I have to connect with facebook to play this game. I would have never brought this or got it as the faotd if I had knew it had to be connected to facebook to play. Words of advice: this app requires facebook connection to play if this is not something u want to do then this app is not for u
0679735259|1.0|First, I was born in 1980; the Vietnam War is very foreign to me and my comments about this book are not meant to disrespect anyone who served or was there in a journalistic capacity.<br /><br />The first 50+ pages are extremely difficult to comprehend. They are ripe with colloquialisms and are written in a semi-concious stream of information (I dare not call them sentences). Rather than being descriptive, the author delivers the scenarios as a jumble of emotion and fleeting bits of memories. For one who regularly reads history-combat history- I have been immersed in other story lines without having to read this 'organic' drivel. As another reviewer commented, this work reeks of arrogance rather than emotion.<br /><br />I actually skipped to the chapters regading Khe Sanh, only so I could attempt to relate. Even in these pages, the turbid writing style held back my immersion, moreso than the fog of war ever could.<br /><br />Thank you to all of the vets and those that risked their lives; but I would rather hear the story from you rather than this garbage.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|Great movie. A little violent at times but nothing too extreme. I'd compare it with the amount of action from any of the Indiana Jones movies. I loved the detail in the characters. Paired with a great story line, this movie can't be missed.
0345803493|5.0|This trilogy is well worth the read. Amazon has some of the best prices. Fifty shades is suspenseful, has humor, romance has real life scenes. Didn't want to put the books down & surely don't want it to end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love her writing style. Only 1 author I know that bests her. The story was pretty intense for a teen action book. I was never bored with!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|wow what a great game. fantastic graphics that are clear and easy to see. Great story line and hard to play. thanks.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I was expecting something much more streamlined.  I realized right away that the setup was too complicated and returned it.  Requiring a base station seems too cumbersome.<br /><br />Editing since most people said this review wasn't helpful:  My TV stand is not huge, and I try to avoid clutter.  The TV is the only thing on top of the stand, and all the components (DVD player, Xbox, Wii, Roku) are all on the lower shelf out of sight.  Since this setup is \\"wireless\\" I was hoping I could get better sound and more comfort from my headset without having to add a lot of clutter.  Once I had this rig in my hands, I realized it was just way too involved for my needs.  The setup instructions were not intuitive and the stand looked bulky and out of place.
0099579936|1.0|I am reading Fifty Shades Darker and I really wish it would just end already. The only reason I am reading the second book is because the first one ended on a cliffhanger. The sex in the first one was disturbing but now it had just become painful to read. Repetitive and boring! And the writing is worse than the sex scenes. Seriously, did this lady even have an editor? If so the person should be fired! Dear, lord. All of you people that rave about this book... I don't understand. Tasteless!  The author broke over and over the number one rule when it comes to DECENT writing.  Show your reader, don't tell them! If I had to edit this book it would be covered in red from first page to last. I would be ashamed to have this book in print if I were the author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book im not going to give anything away but if you love sex dirty talk and being beat this book is for you only thing about it is you have to read all three books  because book one ends with you needing to know more
0679805273|5.0|I have given this wonderful book to all of the high school graduates I've been involved with. It sparks their imagination and lets them know their dreams can be their journey. Dr. Suess wrote for all ages. Let the future begin.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been reading Science Fiction for over 30 years, write reviews for a local bookstore and am a child psychotherapist that is constantly reading and searching for books to recommend for my clients.  For many years I thought, in the field of Science Fiction, nothing could be better than Ender's Game.  Wool just might come close.  In a field overwhelmed with dystopian society books this one stands out above the others.  I spent my entire weekend engrossed in this world and the characters who resided beneath the earth.  I cannot wait to read more from this new author.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I tried out the free version of this game first. Ended up paying for the full game, b/c I loved it. Beautiful game to play through, although who the heck talks like that? The concept is the same as G5's other hidden object games, even the mini-games are similar. Keep em coming G5 and I will be payin to play! Bummer though that I didn't get a choice of a Faotd today!!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love these type of games.  this one is good and is not that hard to do. even one mini puzzle I got by accident.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a good time waster if you don't have anything else to do. However, I don't like the controls. They seem very slow and sticky and they have caused me to lose s game many times.
0765316994|2.0|I love many of Scalzi's other books, but this one really didn't work for me.<br /><br />I've seen my share of Star Trek many years back, but most of the parodies in this book appear to be based on things the fandom speak about, rather than Star Trek itself.<br />It's all very meta - a word which incidentally is used about a gazillion times in this book.<br />The story isn't much of one, and the characters are extremely flat - which is probably another parody in itself, but doesn't really work for me. The character the final twist hangs on is a character I hadn't actually noticed at all during the rest of the story, leaving me slightly confused.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the second Scalzi book I've read that didn't leave me laughing a single time (the other being the Sagan Diary), and its only saving grace was that it was short enough that it didn't waste all that much of my time.<br /><br />If you're deeply into the Star Trek fandom you'll probably love it, as most of the other reviews here indicate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun because its not only one game but its more than one hundred!!! that's awesome.
0312641893|5.0|Oh my god, this book is amazing! This is the kind of book you never want to end because it's just so... amazing! It's fresh, original, and totally unique. It meshes two completely different worlds -- fairy tales and machinery/science -- and it does so miraculously.<br /><br />Cinder is Cinderella meets cyborg meets plague meets other worlds meets politics. Talk about an incredible combination. The different elements of this book are what it make it so incredibly fascinating. First, this story is set in a futuristic Beijing. That immediately drew me in because it's such an original setting. I have literally never read a YA book that takes place in Beijing! Moving on.. Cinder is a cyborg who lives with her evil stepmother and her two stepsisters. Her stepmother only keeps her around for the extra income -- Cinder is an amazing mechanic! But naturally, all of her income goes straight into the greedy stepmother's pocket.<br /><br />In this futuristic world, a terrible plague is taking lives. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to where the plague starts or how it chooses its victims, and therefore there is no cure. When Cinder's stepsister becomes infected, her stepmother offers up Cinder to become a lab experiment. Cyborgs are taken in and experimented on in hopes of finding a cure for the plague.. but so far, no luck.<br /><br />And amidst all of this, there is a super delicious spark brewing between Cinder and the prince of New Beijing: Kai. YUM! These two are seriously the cutest couple ever! There's no annoying drama, no \\"I'm going to tell you what to do\\" attitude, no \\"guy is a jerk/bad boy\\" nonsense.. it's just beautiful! I was constantly rooting for them and hoping things would work out.<br /><br />There are so many incredible themes and emotions riddled throughout Cinder that I barely even know where to begin. It's really about a girl who is treated like an outcast. Since she's a cyborg, she's viewed as a freak, and she has to try to find a way to live with that. Part of how she copes is actually by trying to hide her true identity. With enough clothing to cover up her parts, she can actually pass as human. Cinder is also about friendship, family, independence, and loyalty, and sticking with someone through all the difficulties -- no matter what. Then there's everything with Kai. He's the prince of an entire nation and has a huge weight on his shoulders. He has to make difficult decisions and incredible sacrifices, and he's still only a teenager.<br /><br />Cinder is super fast paced and there is never a dull moment. I was glued to my book all day until I finally got to the last page. Marissa Meyer, you are now one of my favourite authors and the Cinder is right up there with my favourite books of all time!t.

B006UG90RM|4.0|Diamond Dave's vocals sounding energetic and soulful.....(you can tell that he is having a blast...during the recording sessions). Eddie....being Eddie and Alex drumming really well. \\"She's a woman\\" is the best track, though I love \\"Stay Frosty\\" (despite being a cheesy song) and \\"Tattoo\\".. 65% of the songs are very good and well produced...(raw Van Halen..the way it's supposted to be)...I will rate the album 4 out of 5 stars just because it's a Van - Diamond Dave album (despite the fact that 35% of the songs are clearly B-sides)...!

B007XH6BPG|3.0|I've run thru this a few times, and while there is no carping about the musicianship, most of the music doesn't grab me. Like GTR back in its day, this seems like something dreamed up by corporate (If they don't tour this, then I'm positive it's corporate). Not sure what's with the Asian icon, as there isn't anything particularly \\"Asian\\" about the melodies or the lyrics. Just old guys wanting a Asian tattoo? The backing band is largely Hackett's own group, and given that, it's a bit of a shame they didn't let his vocalist sing the tunes. Neither Hackett nor Squire has a particularly commanding voice. Maybe this would have taken on more life in her voice. What killed GTR for me was the big hair boy band vocalist they used. Musicianship there was ace, but it all went to hell with the Kansas wannabe brought on to sing. So, that mistake was not made here, but still, I think all of Hackett's recent work outshines this effort and Fly From Here does more to confirm Squire's credentials than this one. I don't see Hackett doing a project with Anderson or Wakemen in the future, but maybe a call to other Yesmen like White or Bruford might offer better results. This is OK. Caveat Emptor.

0762434260|1.0|I ordered wands for both my boys (ages 7 & 9) since they are HUGE Harry Potter fans. While these wands may seem attractive from the online description, they are very poorly designed and manufactured. Each of the four sections screw together with short plastic built-in screws. As soon as we assembled the wands, both broke at the second joint and I had to super glue and duct tape them back together. Once the plastic screw breaks off inside the wand section, it is literally impossible to get it out. Super glue works temporarily as a result.<br /><br />They are value priced for a reason. DO NOT purchase if you intend to use this wand as a toy since any use will break the wand.
0099579936|2.0|I picked up the book at my local B&N because I was intrigued.  I wanted to see these \\"shocking\\" parts everyone was talking about. The book instilled a bevy of emotions in me.  Some of the sex scenes I found to be quite boring and I skimmed over a lot of them.  One, because hetero sex is somewhat boring to me and Two, I was sad. It made me sad for Ana that she was getting whipped and she didn't want to.  I hated the idea of her being forced to do something she didn't want to do. But at the same time, I enjoyed the love story that was developing between Ana & Christian.  I love any story where there is a character to be \\"rescued\\" and Christian was just that.  The story was basically a Nicholas Sparks story masked behind some ball and chain.  I will probably read the next 2 books because I want to see them reconcile, getting married and live happily ever after. *Sigh* a romantic at heart.

1936608898|5.0|Ive been increasingly paleo for over a year, but my biggest hurdles were keeping up my meal planning motivation. It was so time consuming that I began to give up, but after reading ISWF, and using their awesome, organized, master menu templates, I am easily and quickly able to plan my weekly menus. The organization in HOW to do it in this book just makes sense.  I finally \\"get it!  Not only that, but it persuaded me to take the final plunge of eliminating sugar and dairy, which seemed impossible before. Two nights ago I made my first batch of clarified butter, and today I'm smelling the awesome goodness of bone broth in the crockpot. This book is a must for \\"newbies\\" as well as \\"oldbies\\".  I plan to give this as gifts, especially to my friends and family members that suffer from crones, have ADHD symptoms, and suffer allergies. The people I care about are too important to me not to share this wonderfully done format of knowledge.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I'm an amateur radio operator and generally use headphones, especially when trying to understand weak signals.  I wanted something to give my aging ears a bit more volume when I need t.  I also wanted to be able to share what I was listening to with visitors using additional headphones.<br /><br />I found the HA400 to serve both purposes admirably.  I put it into 24 hours of continuous service just after receiving it.  It worked beautifully in boosting the volume when needed it.  In addition, visitors found it useful to be able to adjust their individual headphone volumes.<br /><br />I haven't actually measured the dynamic range of the HA400 yet, but this past weekend's experience makes me believe it is excellent within the boundaries of the levels that come out of the headphone jack of my receiver.  I noticed no distortion during operation.<br /><br />I believe the HA400 is a good choice cost-effective choice for amplifying and splitting a single audio stream into four headphone-level stereo channels.<br /><br />Be aware that it requires 1/4\\" stereo plugs to mate with.  You will need adapters if you have cords with 1/8\\" plugs.  The unit comes with a wall wart power supply with a generous length of output cable.  There is no ON/OFF switch.<br /><br />FWIW, I'll be ordering one or two more HA400s for use with our home entertainment equipment.  I ordered this unit from Amazon on another account, hence no \\"Verified Purchase\\" notation.  The price was competitive and delivery reasonable.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm really middle of the road with this book. There were things I loved about it, and things I hated. I didn't love the spanking scenes. If she'd have been turned on, then it wouldn't have bothered me, but she was humiliated and crying, and I didn't find that in the least bit a turn on. I liked that he came back, but then he does it again, and she's completely freaked. But, I love his character. I really loved how strong and determined he was. His character was amazingly good. I didn't like hers that much. I really hated the whole inner goddess things. That made me want to puke. I don't regret reading this, and even had to go and buy book two to see what happens. But, I stopped there. I just couldn't see spending another 10 bucks on a book that I didn't care that much for. If the price ever comes down, I'll finish the series, but until then, I've put it away. I had to read it, since its the most talked about book of the year. I couldn't stand not knowing what it was about, but I would've given this 10 stars without those 2 freaking spanking scenes.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|The material in this book will be of no surprise to anyone who has a strong understanding of evolution and the massive amount of evidence supporting it. However, I felt that the title was slightly misleading, considering that it focused more on how evolution/natural selection works. Regardless, there were great sections within the book focusing on the evidence; such as Richard Lenski's work, important areas of the fossil record and vestigiality among other things.<br /><br />This book would be great to read alongside Jerry Coyne's \\"[[ASIN:B002ZNJWJU Why Evolution Is True]]\\".
B0008ENHTE|3.0|There are three reasons to watch BULLITT - 1. Steve McQueen 2. The classic car chase and finally 3. STEVE MCQUEEN!!!<br />There never will be anyone in cinema to compare with Steve McQueen, the King of Cool. He oozes male sexuality as a true man's man. He's not a \\"pretty\\" boy but ruggedly handsome and with his expressive eyes and demeanor, there is little need for dialogue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, BULLITT lacks substance as far as story and writing. The looks and feels dated and it looks like some of the sets, especially in the hospital scenes, were just thrown together with tape and cardboard. This police story is hard to follow as our hero is assigned to protect a witness in a high profile mob case. Frank Bullitt (McQueen) is the man for this somewhat mysterious job. Although the story never comes together and confusion abounds, it's McQueen that makes BULLITT a must see. His coolness factor is off the radar as he handles his assignment.<br /><br />Not to be missed is the classic car chase that is a cinematic legend. This long car chase passes the test of time and does not look or feel dated. McQueen does much of the driving and stunt drivers pull off the rest. The simple act of having a camera in the back seat gives us the roller coaster feel of the car flying over the hills of San Francisco. Obviously, the scene had to be planned meticulously and it works far better than anything you'll see in the day of computer generated special effects. This is realism to the max.<br /><br />If you are a McQueen fan, be sure to buy the 2 disc special edition that has bonus features on McQueen. Two of McQueen's spouses, actor friends, personal friends, his son, stuntmen, directors and more give insight to the man who was Steve McQueen. BULLITT director PETER YATES, DON GORDON, and ROBERT VAUGHN all thought the script was a pass--poor writing, hard to follow and confusing in its plot. Steve McQueen saves this film and turns it into a McQueen classic. He often passed on dialogue to simply convey the story with his expressions. McQueen was a truly remarkable man that we lost too early.

B007WZ7ILK|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this new release by the Beach Boys.  I think I would have chosen a different song from the album as the single (maybe \\"Isn't it Time\\" or \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\". The harmonies are excellent.  If you were an avid fan you will love this recording. WELCOME BACK Beach Boys!
0756404738|5.0|This book is so awesome it is hard to say anything without giving away too much.<br /><br />  What I CAN say, is that we start our reading in a familiar tone, with Kote and Bast and the Chronicler. Then we go over to the University and settle in nicely for some chapters.<br />  Not before too long, old friends and old enemies enter the scene, and there is quite a feel of a \\"Boss Battle\\" being set up. Saying who or why would be too much, but it suffices to say that the sensation of the tension building up as the moment approaches is something very rare to get from a book.<br /><br />  And speaking of \\"suffice\\", the later half of Wise Man's Fear is even better than the beggining. At last we get to see some of the several thing of wich Kvothe boasts of in the very beggining of The Name of the Wind. Reading as re becomes a legend is very enthralling, as you can't stop but wonder when we'll get to see that one character again, and what will happen when they meet.<br />  Like in the first novel, we have enough happening in the interludes to keep us interested of what will become of the Innkeeper and his assistent. We're given a shiny new mistery to muse over nearly before the end, which goes in the same direction as the first one.<br /><br />  Needless to say, once the last word is read, there's nothing else on your mind but getting your hands on the last part of the Kingkiller Chronicles. And no, that's not a reason why you should wait for the launch of the third book before reading this one.<br />  At the end of Wise Man's Fear, you'll have enough material to formulate all the theories you want of what will become of the characters in the last novel. I, for one, believe it wise to take this chance Patrick Rothfuss has given us to prepare for the real ending.<br /><br />  Bottom line is: if you haven't bought The Wise Man's Fear yet, you shouldn't procrastinate any longer.
B002APU580|5.0|WONDERFUL!  Made this Jane Austin fan extremely happy.  I still prefer Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, but the leading man did an excellent job.  Everything was very well done.
0307594165|5.0|Frank Money is the only one of three childhood friends to survive their battles in Korea. Back in the States, Frank is battling demons and survivor guilt. He's always been the strong one, taking care of his little sister Cee. Now he needs help from others to try to make it back to her when he hears that she is near death and needs to be rescued.<br /><br />His journey back to being the kind of man who can rescue his sister is both physical and spiritual. Frank travels a reverse Underground Railroad, finding refuge at a church after waking up in a mental hospital and escaping. As he travels home, the reader learns of how he and Cee grew up, how she got out of a backwoods place smaller than a town and where she ended up. Also revealed is how Frank has been fighting to hold on and not give up, but his war was hardly a good one. He is the only one who survived. And for what?<br /><br />Morrison's short novel is tightly written, weaving in and out of points along the plot, themes, tropes and characters. It is a marvel to be studied and wondered at. But it also is a moving story of how African-Americans have been treated in their own country and how these individual characters react to what other people do to them. Frank and Cee have been victimized but are not victims.<br /><br />After serving his country, Frank doesn't have anything except a medal. It's the only thing that keeps him from being arrested for the crime of being on the street and black. Cee thinks she has found the most wonderful employer in the world, but the white doctor she works for is killing her with his eugenics study. That the horror of what this \\"big-hearted doctor\\" named Beauregard is doing to Cee is not spelled out does not make it any less terrifying. The realization that the kind of thinking demonstrated by this ultimately cowardly man flourishes still today is even more terrifying, just as knowing the casual bigotry Frank encounters from white cops is seen is today's \\"stop and frisk\\" is, at best, disheartening.<br /><br />Frank drank and found a strong woman to use as an anchor for a time. She is both similar to and the opposite of the grandmother who took in Frank, Cee, their parents and an uncle when they were forced to flee Texas (Cee was born on the road).<br /><br />That grandmother, Lenore, is cold and cruel. Her active dislike of Cee is one of the reasons they both fled Lotus, Georgia, as soon as they could -- Frank to the Army and Cee running off with the first half-way grown man who wanted her. Lenore is like Miss Havisham without an Estrella to control and mentally abuse. She resents that she was able to use the money raised from selling her late husband's filling station (he was murdered, guilty of the crime of being black) but, instead of enjoying her life, she had to open her home to the family of her second husband. In contrast, Frank seeks shelter for a spell with Lily, a woman who has scrimped and saved enough to dream of owning a home and a business. When Frank leaves, she doesn't regret his going but there is not the sense that she resented the time she spent opening her heart and home to him. She just has other, better things to do now.<br /><br />Many small actions reveal the true nature of the characters involved in the lives of Frank and Cee. These moments are powerful, and far more revealing, than the work of many authors who take pages and pages of tell, not show, to portray characters. The portraits work as individual portrayals, but they also combine to show the scope of what people can be capable of doing.<br /><br />And, as with much of Morrison's work, there are ghosts. The first is one Frank sees on the train while trying to get home to Cee. It's a man in a zoot suit. A later appearance tells the reader that Frank is truly starting to heal. His physical journey has ended, but there is the implication his spiritual journey will continue. The quiet healing that takes place after the climax of the plot's action may leave some readers expecting more. But I thought it wasn't needed. Morrison was interviewed by Charlie Rose on the CBS morning program earlier this year and acknowledged she is stripping her fiction down as much as she can. A revelation late in the novel, and the way the last sections fit in tightly with the beginning, make more unnecessary.<br /><br />Another ghostly figure that appears is Frank himself. Most of the novel is told in third-person omniscient. Frank at one point addresses that narrator. So when the revelation occurs, it's could be considered a surprise or, instead, the harvest of a seed planted in that passage. Frank, addressing the narrator, puts a different spin on an event that happened when the train stopped. A couple got off the train and came back bloodied. According to the narrative, the woman will be beat up by the man later because she shamed him for coming to his rescue. But Frank says differently:<br /><br /> \\"Earlier you wrote about how sure I was that the beat-up man on the train to Chicago would turn around when they got home and whip the wife who tried to help him. Not true. I didn't think any such thing. What I thought was how he was proud of her but didn't want to show how proud he was to the other men on the train. I don't think you know much about love.<br /><br /> \\"Or me.\\"<br /><br />As an example of how Morrison weaves so many things together, at another stage of his train journey Frank gets off the train for a walk and sees two women fighting while a man, presumably a pimp, watches them. He attacks the man and the women are angry about that. A person in power forcing others to fight comes up again in the story, and is tied to the way that Frank has always tried to protect Cee.<br /><br />Throughout this tight story, Morrison remembers the forgotten. There are vets like Frank, himself a decorated veteran of that most forgotten of wars, Korea. There are victims of eugenics and other experiments undertaken on African-Americans without their knowledge or informed consent. There are domestic workers. There are ignored children. There are women alone. There are tiny, tiny towns where work is the only thing that matters. Morrison gives all of them a voice. And it's one that often is poetic. Frank's description of Lotus (a name with its own conotations of time spent outside regular time), does more in two pages to bring to life the dull hopelessness of a dead-end existence.<br /><br />The contrast in attitude about work between Frank as a young boy and the women of Lotus is markedly different.<br /><br />This underlying belief is the foundation of what will heal Frank and Cee.<br />The search for home in this novel shows there is the potential to do some good in the world, even by those who have been broken and who have been ignored or forgotten. Morrison does not have to spell out what that good will be, but showing the first steps Cee and Frank take toward doing their good as they heal makes for a strong argument that the wise woman of Lotus is right.

1475143389|5.0|I bought this book almost a month ago and it has really helped me. After reading other reviews i thought this would be a good buy and it definitely was. I have emailed the guy about some questions i had and he responded the next day with a good bit of info. He is really trying to help people get in better shape and not just trying to sell something. I know results vary from person to person but since i started doing the things he said in the book my bench weight has gone up almost 30 pounds so that speaks for itself. This book helped me get over my current plateau so that makes it worth it. Buy this book if you want to learn real information about building healthy muscle instead of buying bogus crap fed to you by a roid freak in a muscle mag.
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|I have been an avid Dark Shadows for years, having read the books, seen the TV show and have the DVDs.  I knew this movie was going to be a spoof and I think Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did a marvelous job.  This movie is not meant to be rewrite of the series but a comedy.  It was wonderful.  It had many of the old characters in it and even some of the original cast did a walk-on.  The music took me back to the 60's and 70's, but may not have had this effect on younger people.  I am 65 and saw this movie four times!  I sang to the tunes and just had a lot of fun with this.  I also became a Johnny Depp fan!  Sometimes you just have to play and have fun and this movie did it for me!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Many people have hesitations toward this book because of the vivid sexual descriptions but to me that all played a second role in comparison tongue love story between the two characters. Both are finding out how to love in a passionate relationship that began out of lust and desire, as most do. Throughout the book and the series there relationship with eachother, and with themselves as individuals, changes and they form a true bond not only based on the sex but on an understanding of eachother. I say read it!! It will help you in many aspects of your own relationsip (and yes it is a fun ;) read)!!!
B0074EIQQU|5.0|I'm not going to write a full page review, reviewing each track, in hopes of swaying the listenr one way or the other. Instead, I'm going to be frank about the experience of listening to this album and a brief paragraph summing up my personal TMV album experience through the years. It's true TMV changes with each album. Deloused still had a very heavy ATDI feel to it, Frances The Mute seemed a bit tedious (the title track's 4+ minute of bells is tough to get through.) Amputechture was a great step in evolution for the band while Bedlam (my personal favorite) was a fantastic journey at a light speed pace. I know a lot of TMV fans who were disappointed with Octahedron. I however, LOVED that record. I have always been a huge fan of Cedric's softer vocal side (i.e. Televators, The Widow, Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore, Asilos Magdalena). He has one of the most amazing vocal ranges in music history and Octahedron gave me a full album of exactly what I wanted since TMV's inception. That being said, I couldn't wait for Noctourniquet. Bands tend to have many strands of their last album in their latest release so I expected a nice blend of melody, soundscapes, and beautifully arranged/performed vocals. That is exactly what I found in Noctourniquet. Don't get me wrong, there are still rocking moments of bliss on this album but I found my favorite tracks on the record are the mellower, almost shoe-gazer tracks. Cedric breezes through the vocals effortlessly and brilliantly, so astonishingly that I often forget to even listen to the lyrics. If you're a TMV fan and loved their softer side than this album will completely satisfy. No it's not Bedlam Pt 2 or The Missing Chromosome Pt 2, but that's what I love about it. My favorite tracks are AEGIS, EMPTY VESSELS MAKE THE LOUDEST SOUND, LAPOCHKA, and VEDAMALADY (althoug I love the album start to finish)
0800177177|5.0|not like other more expensive version of collection DVD , this comes in just ordinary dvd packet but its quality is good enough to watch, with very resonable price, I have been looking for this movie, because I love this version of all dracula movies. so happy with this dvd.
0345803507|5.0|This is a great look at sex from someone else eyes and life choices. It's a good way to learn just what and how people see things differently, and how sex is used as an outlet. Everyone has to have an outlet in life. Starts out slow but once it gets going look out.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to both men and women as a read to discover how sex is looked at from both sides.

0739383728|5.0|This book is way fun to listen too. The voice is clear and gets you excited about the story. It is tough to push pause once you get into it and it is really easy to get back into it mid-track.  The down side is I don't know if the whole story is actually true somethings seem over-exaggerated.  It made me want to get into trail running and minimalist/zero-drop running.  The book is good for story and for running advice.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|You may have read the other 2000 reviews on this book, so I won't go into great detail. I love the Song of Ice and Fire books. I have the entire audio book series (and am listening to Feast for Crows for the second time). I started reading the Kindle version and even began typing in The Game of Thrones just to get deeper into the feel of the writing. The HBO series is okay, but the books are fantastic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its simple yet fun.I like the fact that it lets you open any game you want on the next level.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|A lot has already been writen about The Black Ice and other Michael Connelly books, so I will skip to my first ecnounter with this series. I was listening to a lot of audio book from the public library and kept seeing The Black Ice. It seemed like all the hollywood cop movies for the last ten years. I listened to the book and was blown away. Now I am building my Kindle library of Connelly as well. Why did the book jacket remind me of popular movies? Because many of the best police / suspense movies came from these books. Go figure.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this puzzle game. I love how easy it is. you don't have to turn the peices to fit. this is fun and easy
0062073478|5.0|Christie really outdid herself when coming up with characters and building the suspense of this book. This isn't one of her mysteries where you get the chance to solve the case before the solution is revealed. The clues necessary for that are just not made available to the reader. The solution does make complete sense within the context of the story, but nothing hints at it at all. But, that's part of the wonderful suspense of the story-- who is going to die next, and who on earth could possibly be the killer? You might have your guesses, but just like the characters, each will be proven incorrect. The suspense builds and builds as there are more bodies and fewer suspects, and seemingly no possible way for everything to be happening the way it is. Like the characters, you wonder whose testimony and actions you can really trust. Truly a masterful work of suspense.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|Excellent book.  Great to be able to download onto my iPad  Highly recommended by friends.  Would recommend as a good read.
0062073567|5.0|This is the perfect murder mystery. There are an ample number of red herrings. What is wonderful, though, is that all the clues are there for the reader to pick up on. You've got the same facts that Poirot does, and so in theory, you could figure out the solution before he reveals it. I doubt you'll get it more than a few pages before, though, and that is if you get it at all. Then you can just sit back and think through how skillfully Christie laid out all the clues for the reader, but hid them in the most mundane sentences. The ending really is brilliant. So, before you read a review that really gives away the ending, stop reading about it and get the book.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I don't know exactly what cable is faulty, but I cant get the right audio on my right headphone.  Since the moment it came, I plugged it in and the cable had a bad contact, which means is broken somewhere inside, but I'm really upset that I only get a good audio on my left side. I do not recommend buying this headset. And please don't even come to me saying I didnt plug it in right because I do this for a living. I'm really p#$%d off
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|this is a great game to pass the time! lots of missions and weapons to use. don't complain about not having enough space, you have to go into the infernal storage and delete things, not apps themselves
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game battle of the sexes is fun and so is the skateboard game . I just love this game so much fun
0439023513|3.0|I lived the first book. Liked the second and we really let down with the third. Mocking jay. The last several chapters felt so rushed. Heartless. Like the writer gave up. I was very sad by how Finnick was just killed with no real description. No mourning his loss. He was just dead. Oh well. After the writer had invested so much time having us see he wasn't a jerk after all then falling in love with him. Gale just disappears from the final chapter. So bizzare to me. The whole book is spent focusing on killin president snow. Then he ends of left to die tied to a post? Lame at best. I really felt it hard to connect with the mother in This last book as well. Also she seemed to really avoid all the other characters in this book. Always sleeping or hiding in closets. I really had higher expectations. And the epilogue was dreadful. She had kids only because gale wanted them. Didn't even seem happy to be with peeta or have her children.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was obsessed with fifty shades of gray and this most definitely filled the void. Loved it, it was a little crude but that is what made it all the better.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|fun game! it worked very well on my kindle fire. kept me entertained for a long time. would have paid for it. great faotd!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is like my favorite app been waiting for it to come out can't. beleave this game is free!!!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Exciting and fun game. I recommend people who love games to play this game.<br />It does have fun strategy and fast game play.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Wow. This was fun, whimsical, and artful.<br /><br />For those who love the old-world classics with a modern twist, this movie has it all.<br /><br />There's a love story, there's crime, there's passion, there's suspense. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />It's been a really long time since I've been hooked from the beginning of a movie the way I was with The Illusionist.<br /><br />And as far as the ending is concerned, it just doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Will watch again.<br /><br />Bravo.
B00846REIS|1.0|This is a vulgar, crude and blatant  attempt at repeating the success of Fifty Shades - and it falls far short.  The character development is poor and both Eva and Gidion come across as juvenile.  It is as if the writer copied scenes from Fifty Shades<br />Clumsy meeting - check<br />Not looking for romance- check<br />Party on parents lawn - check<br />Slip in some S & M - check<br />Don't waste your money or time on this poorly written vulgar attempt at cashing in on someone else's success.
B00881VLCE|5.0|there is a variety of puzzles you can download for a low price or free. the different levels of difficultly wont let you get bored by doing the same puzzle over again.
0143038095|5.0|I read this book in AP ENGLISH class in high school, this book is a must read! Amy Tan is a great writer, the language she used in her books are simple but the real meanings behind the stories are not very easy to get. She is really brilliant in her way of writing about mother-daughter relations or generation gaps. I am a chinese myself and I also have a mother who came from china so I got a better understanding of the story. Four mothers and four daughters, they all had different stories of their own, they had different points of view at things. The daughter never understand their mothers; the mothers could not find a way for their daughters to understand them; these were all because of differences in language, thoughts of different generations, and different cultures and societies. The four mothers had went through a lot in their past, they had made great mistakes and now they're watching their daughters making the same mistakes but the daughters would not listen to their mothers' advises. This story did not just talked about gaps between chinese parents and children, it also portrayed the gaps between parents and children of different races, cultures, and societies.  This is a great literature piece for anybody to read, no matter you're a mother or daughter at any age, you should read this. You won't regret reading this book.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|what a ripoff, bought it for my macbook air i5 and worked fine for a week, then I had to move the cable for it to work and after another week it just wont work. seems like good quality but I hope they invested more in real quality than in appearance.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game :) I play it on the computer all the time and now I have it on the kindle fire :) and I cant wait to get Doodle devil took:))))
030758836X|5.0|What a fantastic read! I could not put this book down and I am so happy that I did not know too much about it before I read it.  Don't let anyone ruin the story for you! It is a page turner!
B003DT194G|2.0|I hate this movie.  The awful sound effects and music made it unbearable. On top of that it didn't have a good story.  The acting was alright.  I'm also a fan of the man with no name trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I take my kindle everywhere. when I get tired of reading I flip to my games and pass the time..... love it....
B0086700CM|3.0|This game is ok. it tends to freeze and then cancel out of the game. it was fun at first but than it got boring.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|This movie was entertaining and full of surprises. The caracter that you least expect to steal your attention in this movie, does just that.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game rocks u can still make an awesome restaurant without gems! u people who say&quot; oh my kid wasted 16 bucks on this game!&quot; probably shouldn't have your immature kids on it anyway. there is something called &quot;watching&quot; that I think u need to do more often then.btw game rocks :p
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is very helpful for those of us who has never done this before. It takes you systematically through the process with clear and precise instructions as well as pictures for those of us who need that visual help. I was able to format and publish my book easily following the instructions in this book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A GREAT BOOK SERIES IN DEPTH WHEN YOU START THE SERIES WITH GAME OF THRONES YOU REALISE HOW MASSIVE THIS SERIES IS WITH ALL OF THE CHARACTERS BUT BY PAGE 200 YOU ARE HOOKED AND IT IS EASY TO FOLLW
B00005ABIP|5.0|This CD is wonderful!I It is very fun and catchy! I have listened to it every time I drive on repeat since it arrived- it's hard to turn off because there are so many good songs! Purchasing the CD is worth it alone for track one: Satan is My Motor!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I loved this game! I hope more come out like it. It is wonderful for the faotd.  Please come up with more like this!
B0050XFXT0|5.0|An awesome video!  If anyone ever wanted to know about the personality of the TARDIS, this is the show to watch!  Yeah, it's the \\"Doctor\\", but I'd like to have seen how David Tennant<br />would have respnded in this.  Or maybe Tom Baker.  Either way, it's a great story!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|How on earth did this franchise become a best seller? I'm not going to go on about the total lack of a story line or the over usage of \\"oh my\\" or even about 20 sex scenes per chapter as I have already wasted to much time on this pile of crap. Just don't read it that's all I will say!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this app is challenging.  I use the help a lot but love it because later I can replay levels. my kids also love this app. I like any app you don't have to have a wifi connection
0143038583|5.0|What an interesting read on a topic that the average American might think they know everything they need to.  Mr. Pollan's research is deep and wide.  After reading his biography I was at first concerned his book may be yet another \\"enviro-rant\\" with no salient revelations or observations.  I could not have been more wrong.  Additionally, he provides a fair and honest look at the experience of the novice hunter.  With his work and those of other heroes in this space, perhaps our industrial food system can be changed in a way that it will provide food to those who need it without destroying the animals, environment and people who are intricately linked to it.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I think it's disgusting that Lego is sold out and isn't planning on making anymore, simply because sellers on sites like this one buy them all up and charge twice the cost for them......... It's no different than when ZhuZhu pets were hot and there were people going to Walmarts at 5 AM every morning to buy all of them that had been stocked overnight so they could sell them online......
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|To be honest I really don't like hidden object games anyway.  Also, this game was free, I did not pay for it. It was the free app of the day on Amazon.  I didn't know what this was until I opened it.  Since it is a hidden object game, I will compare it to 4 other hidden object games I have installed and played...<br /><br />This hidden object game was very hard, and therefore it was boring. I lost interest after a few minutes because the story line was dull and dragged on and on pointlessly. It's just a hidden object game so why all the story line and the chat boxes? I'm glad I didn't purchase this game. This game stopped being fun after only 3 objects found. Even with the zoom feature, it was very hard to click on the objects and I have one of the largest hi-res displays on any Android phone. I also have one of the brightest displays, yet it was very hard for me to distinguish individual objects because they were all similar color and shade.  Obviously the developer was trying to make the game hard, and for some people that might be what they are looking for.  For me, making the game this hard made it boring and dull.<br /><br />I would not encourage anyone to purchase this game unless they are looking specifically for a extra challenging hidden object game. If you are looking for such a game, this one will give you hours of enjoyment.

B005HP2JAM|5.0|I first saw this movie in 3D at the theater. So i had to get it when it came out.<br />It is a documentary  I found it to be  spell binding  almost magical.  To see that humans were really here 30,000 years ago and the art work that was left behind on the cave walls showed great talent. the hand prints left by one person in a niche on the cave wall left me feeling that someone was marking time....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its entertaining. fun addicting a great way to kill time I love it woo much I recommend this game for any one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very fun game but after a while it becomes very hard to get new games without the free coins you get from down loading apps
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|This one isn't as grand and sweeping as we've come to expect from Reynolds.  He seems to want to tell us about some interesting technology he's been thinking about and uses the characters in the story to do that -- but there's no grand theme holding it together enough that I care overly much about anyone in the book.  It's well written and interesting, but not gripping like his other work.
B004RSCWZ2|3.0|Every fan of the Derek Trucks Band should understand that this is not a DTB album.  It is a Tedeschi album.  As Mies van der Rohe said, \\"More is Less.\\"  Since I do not have Derek Trucks's artistic genius, I can neither understand nor judge why he rid himself of his superb rhythm section, and then put himself and his superlative singer, Mike Mattison, into the background, all to showcase his wife's talents.  She is, of course, talented, but if you want soulful music punched up by an inspired horn section, buy any Stax-Volt collection instead.  I recommend Derek's Song Lines album.
B00846TRHY|5.0|What a film.  Being a born again Christian myself, I almost gave up on the film in the first few minutes due to the graphically bad language, but I'm glad I hung on.  I've always felt that genuine faith shows it's fruit in action, and this story shows the length some will go to help others.  It's a hard film to watch, but it shows that God can change anyone if they will let them, and a life of true faith will not be boring, but it can rock your world.  Gritty, dirty, and fearless, this is wild ride.

B00785P2QC|5.0|I. love it.  it feels so real it is a good expereance for kids to play. its so awesome u shod try it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is really cool it tells you exactly how much battery life you have left . it is awesome if you are looking for a cool app look. it up
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game- still challenges me after all these months.  live seeing the updates or additions.  up to 101+23.  is there any more coming?
B007ZKY7XO|2.0|After 3 brilliant releases, the Scissor Sister's 4th studio album Magic Hour leaves much to be desired.  It's not a bad album, per se, it's just not on par with what I've come to expect from them.  Perhaps it was the departure of drummer Paddy Boom or maybe Jason Sellards is losing some of his steam, but regardless, this latest creation is not going to wow you like their previous releases.  Even the primary single \\"Only the Horses\\" is lackluster at best...the rest just falls flat when compared to the amazing quality the Scissor Sisters have proved themselves capable of.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Great album.  Getting there new sound working finally.  Atleast 8 tracks will be on the radio.  Blows their last two releases out of the water.  Great melody on Skin to Bone
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I was a little disappointed initially, because I fell in love with A Thousand Suns, and unfortunately for me, the two don't sound entirely alike. However, this album has some great moments and some really great songs. I'm excited for what LP brings to the table next.. Chester still screams, which is always a good thing, but he also sings a lot, which is great because he has such a versatile voice, and a great one too.<br /><br />Mike Shinoda. What can I say about him? He's amazing. He is so multi-talented: co-producer of Living Things alongside Rick Rubin, I'm sure he's playing a bunch of the instruments throughout the album, rapping, and goodness can he sing too. It's great to see the progress he has made vocally. Clearly Chester and Mike have their own distinct voices, but when it switches from Mike to Chester, or from Chester to Mike, sometimes it takes a second or two to know which one it is (I think they might do that on purpose sometimes), and I mean that as a great compliment to Mike, as I think Chester has one of the best voices I've ever heard. I may have lied earlier, there is one other small qualm I have with this album, I believe in two songs, Mikes vocals are absent. Not that that makes the songs not good, but I just love to hear his voice.<br /><br />The lyrics are impressive as ever. That's what's so great about Linkin Park: you can tell they put a lot of thought into their lyrics, and that those lyrics actually mean something to them. It's great in some of their videos they go through the lyric writing process, and it's always interesting to see the initial product versus the finished one, it goes to show how much they care about what they put out and they aren't just writing something quick and easy to rhyme catchy tune.<br /><br />One thing about this album that made me really happy, as I was hoping so bad that it would actually happen (I might be incorrect in this, I need to go through the lyrics carefully), but I believe that there is no swearing in this album. Not that I really have a too big a problem with swearing, at least not in some music, but it's nice to be able to play the music around anyone and everyone, be it family or friends, without having to feel like I might upset or offend someone. Really glad it turned out that way.<br /><br />I could go on but I will just say that, I think this is a great album. If you found yourself okay with A Thousand Suns then you will for sure enjoy this album, if, for some reason (a reason I undoubtedly disagree with, but to each his or her own), you did not like A Thousand Suns, you would do well to avoid this album. But maybe not, because I guess some people that didn't like A Thousand Suns said they liked Burn It Down and/or Lies Greed Misery. I guess I would say that it doesn't hurt to listen either way. Just bear in mind, if you don't like it, that Linkin Park doesn't really care, as exemplified through some of their lyrics (i.e., When They Come For Me, A Thousand Suns).<br /><br />Major respect for Chester, Mike, Rob, Phoenix, Brad, and Joe, you guys are so talented. Linkin Park, please keep doing what you do, and please never stop making music. LP for ever!
B00884GR0W|5.0|very good glad they have crafting finnaly they added clouds and stars in the sky but I still haven't tested if ur house will dissapere or not but I'm pretty surenthey fixed.it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm in the middle of the trilogy and i just cannot stop reading it.... I loved it!<br />Very sensual and erotic. I'm liking the way it's written because although it has a lot of \\"sexual scenes\\" they are so well written that they are enjoyable
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is exactly what you're looking for: basic solitaire with fun features without trying to get too fancy or confusing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There is not much to say about this book that has already been said. My two cents: it feels completely authentic. I loved the characters and while I did NOT need boxes of tissues, my heart ached at the end. This book moved me; I am so glad I took a chance on this YA novel.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive. Graphics are great,  like your really there. The movement is smooth and easy to control. Love it when the chimpanzees are after me, it adds to the excitements. Great adventure.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great game-challenging but lots of fun. Kids who like seek and find games would do well but it's very playable for adults and you might even be asking your kids for some help and another pair of eyes.
B007SGM084|4.0|I'm actually really enjoying this book. At first I was reading it just to see what all the hype was about. Then I started reading it. I can't put it down. Not because of the content but the story line has me wondering what is next. The last chapter of the first book had me in tears. I'm a murder mystery reader so this is definitly out of my norm. I can't wait to finish the trilogy but then where do I go from there?
B00881VLCE|1.0|really looked forward to playing this but no amount of double tapping makes a puzzle piece rotate. very very disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like this app, although I wish it had some  commentaries, and  I like all the different reading plans.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The. puzzle pieces are right. above. the ads so end up going to the store frequently.  Puzzles piece svery small. on preview and sometimes. got stuck so I. couldn't finish. My main issue was that. there is a very small selection.  You can buy more pics but they are $1per pic.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It is a fun game but it can get hard I cant wait till there is an update to see whats new
B004XISI4A|5.0|Absolute page turner. Now watching tv show, but as I am far in front of that in the book, it may be spoiling the tv show somewhat.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i have read the book 2 times now, the second time was much better.. i don't know if its because i know how it all ends or just that i paid closer attention this time, me personaly i really liked to see how the relationship grows between them & darker is the best book of all 3 of them .. keep reading i promise you will not want to put them down
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its good for me to start reading the Bible and reading it for 5 minutes it helps me communicate with god!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this story....It's a little different than the Urban lit that I'm use to ...but it had a nice little story line with it...I could definitely see the message behind this...I'm glad I read this, instead of listening to the mixed reviews about it...I recommend to anyone interested in reading this book ...to judge for yourself...I thought it was a good book! I can't wait to start book 2...
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun! I enjoyed this game. Wish it was just coins used and not invest points as well. Still fun! Time killer.
B0087240Z4|3.0|I approached this album with due skepticism. Zeitgeist had Tarantula and little more, and the singles being released for Teargarden were underwhelming. I've listened to it through a few times now and although it feels closer to the early Smashing Pumpkins (pre- Siamese Dream), it is something else entirely. I think Billy Corgan does his best impression of himself as a member of SP, but it feels contrived and almost like an imitation of the real thing. After listening to this, I went back and listened to Machina II, and was surprised at how much it still impresses me, and how this new album fails to reach that same level.
B00005RDRO|4.0|With 186 reviews already, so much has already been said about this terrific movie. It ranks up there as probably my favorite movie of all time, apart from a bunch of Vincent Price shows.<br /><br />In any case, I watch this thing probably once a year or more as a tradition. And though I know probably the whole thing by heart (a la The Holy Grail), it is still a joy to watch it. The characters are wonderful, the actors are even more so. Being a huge Peter Sellers fan probably pushes my bias meter over, but so what. Throw in David Niven, Peter Falk, Captoe--the cast could not have been better, I think.<br /><br />There is, of course, a final twist in this thing. For those who have not watched it before, it is one of the better ones out there, and a prime way for Simon to poke at all of the pulp mystery writers and their works.<br /><br />Go get this movie and watch it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The Game content is weak.  There is just not enough to hold your interest level. Additionally, it uses a lot of memory, which may have been worth it, if the game content was there.
B0002PZVHK|5.0|\\"On Land\\" is the most shadowy and most threatening of the four Eno (or three Eno and one Eno-produced) albums labeled \\"Ambient.\\" The first album, \\"Music for Airports,\\" had featured acoustic piano, electric piano, synthesizer and voice. The second, \\"The Plateaux of Mirror,\\" was dominated by the piano of Eno's partner for that project, Harold Budd, with some ghostly synth touches and \\"treatments\\" by Eno. The third, \\"Day of Radiance,\\" was credited to zither and dulcimer player Laraaji, with Eno again \\"treating\\" the sounds by altering them sonically. \\"On Land\\" did feature synthesizers, but also the sounds of birds, amphibians, and even rocks and sticks that Eno decided to use as instruments.<br /><br />The result is a much darker work, yet one that retains the sense of exacting quietude that had marked the first three albums. In general, all four albums always have sounded best to me when played after nightfall, but this is especially true of \\"On Land\\" -- it's just one of those records that begs to be listened to when you have insomnia and everyone else is abed.<br /><br />Seriously, this record has gotten me through a lot of dark nights and not a few dark nights of the soul. Listening to it, I have always felt, at once, challenged, somewhat disquieted, and strangely comforted. I suspect my experiencing those conflicting feelings is exactly the kind of effect Eno intended the album to have -- and also that my reactions to it are no more valid than someone else who might have a completely different response.<br /><br />This is a brilliant collection of music, highly recommended to anyone with an open mind and open ears.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the three books in four days. That shows I was interested, which is always good in a book series.<br /><br />I had a question at the onset: How could this girl who unknowingly put herself in the midst of a clash of powers beyond her grasp turn out? Even though Katniss's self-deprecating was boring sometimes, I found the way the story was resolved very satisfying. Even the way he chose between Peeta and Gale was good.<br /><br />The intensity of what was on the last two books surprised me. I went to check how old \\"young adults\\" are supposed to be. I found they are in the range of 14 to 21 years-old. I would say this book is more for 18 - 25, but what the heck.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I bought this album when it was first released way back in 1978. I was 17, almost 18, at the time, and purchased the record mainly because of a review I read in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine.<br /><br />I took it home and instantly put it on my turntable. What I heard was like ... NOTHING else I'd ever heard in my life: Quiet, pensive loops of musical phrases, played mostly on keyboards. The very air of my room seemed to change; it became more open, more spacious but at the same time more intimate. If you're an Eno fan, you know exactly what I mean. If you're not, it may be high time you found out.<br /><br />Eno wanted, at the time, to make music that could be paid attention to or that could fade into the background of whatever it was you were doing in your life as you listened to it. I found that idea very refreshing. We ALL use music sometimes as sonic wallpaper, and here, finally, was an artist not only willing to admit that fact but proud of embracing it!<br /><br />The instrumentation is sparse: Electric piano, acoustic piano and synthesizer, except for two tracks on which a trio of female singers provide vocals. The \\"arrangements\\" of the four pieces, if \\"arrangements\\" they can be called, are simple, repetitive and hypnotic.<br /><br />And, most important, despite the apparent simplicity, there is something very, very moving about the whole thing. Eno may have succeeded in making \\"ambient\\" music, but that doesn't mean it wasn't memorable.<br /><br />I have been listening to this album for 34 years and still have not \\"gotten\\" all of it. That's the mark of great music -- when it can be returned to, over and over again, and when it gives you something slightly different every time you encounter it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a good book. I read it in one day. It was surpring, easy to read, and has too great of a cliff-hanger of an ending to wait for the next book (fortunately, I had the next book ready). I felt \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\" are really one book.<br /><br />Definitely, it is way darker than the Harry Potter series, and more male friendly than Twilight.

B005MYWZIO|5.0|This British singer-songwriter has created quite a stir with his debut album, Home Again. Michael Kiwanuka, 24, has already been compared to Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Randy Newman, Van Morrison, and even the likes of The Temptations. These are in no way unjust comparisons. The moment Home Again starts, you are immediately transported into a 70s hodgepodge of upbeat acoustic tunes mixed with some psychedelic grooves, all backed with more soul than you can shake a leg to. Kiwanuka smoothly slides in and out of the 11 songs on this album; it's like one big soul river that flows faster and slower depending on his mood. He has no problem switching from a truly vulnerable and soothing ballad into an upbeat, groovy tune full of flutes and bell chimes. No one instrument is overpowering during the album. However, since Kiwanuka's vocals are showcased rising above the rest, the backup instruments serve as perfect light accompaniment. With his truly rooted and uncompromising R&B sound, it's no wonder that he has already won BBC's Sound of 2012 award. Do not miss \\"I Won't Lie,\\" \\"Home Again,\\" and \\"Rest.\\"<br /><br />By Grayson Sandford

B0041B785Y|5.0|Colossal Swedish metal forerunners Meshuggah have grinded out their seventh studio album entitled Koloss. Harking back to a less rigid and more organic sound and production than their previous effort, Obzen, this album will surely satisfy fans of old material and serve as a fresh platter of metallic goodness to new ones. This doesn't mean Meshuggah's unfathomable time signatures and density aren't present, though. \\"I Am Colossus\\" opens the album with a lethargic crawl of heavy percussion and crunchy guitars that build up to the beautiful, off kilter catharsis fans have come to love. The wide range of vocals are as maddening as ever, especially accompanied with such thought provoking lyrics courtesy of drummer Thomas Haake. \\"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave Them Motion\\" references humanitarian Albert Schweitzer on the thoughtlessness of violence and the inevitable backlashes from it. With nauseating roller coaster ride qualities, \\"Demiurge\\"'s hypnotic melodies are capped off with Fredrik Thordendal and Mårten Hagström's unique guitar work. With skill sets as brilliant as theirs, it's no wonder that they helped coin the genre now known as djent.<br /><br />By Zach Stanton

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The Lumineers have something very special in the sea of mediocrity that many folk inspired artists have fallen into lately. They have originality. The Denver, CO trio brings about a large and vibrant sound while keeping the simplicity of their songwriting very true to the roots of folk. Even when they are fusing other musical styles with their sound, including rock and strong gospel qualities, it always has a constant foot stomping heartbeat of true folk. Songs like \\"Submarine\\" are littered with several instruments, creating a large, happy sound. Others, such as the haunting love song \\"Ho Hey,\\" sport just a guitar with accented shouts and tambourines. Just when you think you've captured their style, songs like \\"Big Parade\\" will catch you by surprise, starting somewhere pure and quiet and ending with a full band of powerful handclaps and screaming vocals. What's most notable is their accessibility to all listeners. You really don't have to be a diehard folk fan to enjoy them; their influences are so broad but fully realized that you'll be hooked by first listen.<br /><br />By Grayson Sandford

B0074EIQQU|5.0|The Mars Volta's sixth studio album, Noctourniquet, possesses an enigmatic quality. While shortening the songs to a more standardized pop verse/chorus structure, the music has somehow become less accessible in term of musicality. This enigma becomes immediately apparent on the opener, \\"The Whip Hand,\\" and the first single, \\"The Malkin Jewel,\\" as their sonic danceability melts across the tracks to the off kilter simplicity of latest drummer Deantoni Park's contribution. Fans of their last offering, Octahedron, will eat up the track \\"Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound,\\" with vocalist Cedric Bixler's ballad style melancholy firing off in top notch. Most noticeable is his tendency to sing in lower tones as opposed to his often manic soprano style. Songwriter Omar Rodriguez's guitar craft that sets the band apart continues to morph into extraordinary textural planes, especially on \\"Noctourniquet\\" and \\"Dyslexicon.\\" Though The Mars Volta continues to grow, they're sticking to their progressive roots. Bixler stated in an interview, \\"It's about embracing life for what it should be. There's a view of the elitist lifestyle--that being an artist is unattainable. I'm trying to write this story that reminds people that we're all artists.\\"<br /><br />By Zach Stanton

B007DJUO8O|5.0|Quite possibly the progressive music scene's most anticipated album of 2012, Storm Corrosion's self titled debut album presents the meeting of two masterminds: Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth and Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree. Don't expect Opeth's harsh material or Wilson's space rock style, though. This album, released as the final part of a trilogy between Opeth's Heritage and Wilson's Grace For Drowning, is a quiet, minimalistic, and somber gem. Minimalism's tendency to slowly grow on you has always been the driving quality behind its replay value, and this release especially proves no different. Percussion, in comparison to other releases, has been greatly reduced to a solely atmospheric effect. Blending together in perfect harmony, Wilson's emotional symphonies and Akerfeldt's melancholy guitar work emit eerie effects throughout the melodies of tracks \\"Lock Howl\\" and \\"Drag Ropes.\\" Wilson's knack for angelic vocals shines on the title track, as he sings alongside acoustic guitar picking that swells to an unsettling orchestral climax. Closing out the album, Akerfeldt's falsetto opens \\"Ljudet Innan,\\" presenting a warm and welcoming surprise to an unforgettable ending.<br /><br />By Zach Stanton

B0000VCZK2|5.0|BIRTHED (THEN ESCAPED) FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWS<br /><br />Rumour Control, here are the facts: the nine disk ALIEN QUADRILOGY Box Set (pictured above) is an absolute must-own, worth every last penny.<br /><br />Thanks, Brian, couldn't have put it better myself...<br /><br />Anyone interested in the sci-fi/horror phenomenon no doubt has their own favourite ALIEN movie. In my case it has to be the first, the one where the H.R. GIGER's acid-for-blood, exo-skeletal chestbursting masterpiece makes its spectacular debut. And yet, whilst fully delivering on what is nowadays referred to as 'genre expectations', Ridley Scott's ALIEN still manages to be the model of restraint, a 'less means more' approach to storytelling and is consequently the best film in the series.<br /><br />In complete contrast (and necessarily so), James Cameron directs his ALIENS with all the subtlety of a migraine attack. It's a brilliantly staged affair that - once you get over the gung-ho Uncle Sam histrionics - provides a very exciting continuation of the story, throwing into sharp relief the terrifying link between Ripley and the Alien Queen (the dual parallels of surrogate motherhood being a particularly strong and bloody motif throughout). An excellent film, sponsored by Neurofen.<br /><br />It's only with hindsight that David Fincher's ALIEN 3 can be assessed with a degree of rationality. In 1991 it seemed a disappointing mess in comparison with what had come before but now, thanks to the extras, we can at least understand why the production was so troubled. Yet there were many good elements in that second sequel, some of which clearly fell under the radar of disappointment first time around. A long-overdue revisit to Fiorina Fury 161 therefore may be a pleasant surprise - it certainly was for me. For further information and insight check out THE ALIEN QUARTET by David Thomson, published by Bloomsbury. (see review)<br /><br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ALIEN RESURRECTION is, to my mind, the most controversial of the quad. Part European Art-house, part formulaic actioner, it never quite gels in the way it should. Certainly, it has the overall feel and texture of everything that's gone before but there's a chill vein running through the centre of this film that fails to warm up even as the story heads back to Mother Earth. Good, but it could have been so much better.<br /><br />The extras for ALIEN QUADRILOGY are by themselves reason enough to purchase. Directors, producers, screenwriters, actors, modelmakers, composers, designers, set-decorators...all talk candidly about every aspect of the four films. Fox deserves huge credit for not stepping on studio-critical opinions and, as a result, there is a genuine sense of good and talented people doing the best they can in often very trying circumstances. It's a very refreshing look behind the scenes and renders the featurettes (of which there are many) totally engrossing.<br /><br />Picture and sound quality is excellent throughout and the packaging clearly shows that Fox have pride in their product. It's an inspired way to show off each 'Director's Cut' to its best possible advantage and, short of a 3D  reworking, there is no better representative of the ALIEN franchise currently available.<br /><br />Get a hold of this now, and then let it get a hold of you. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDcontroversial of the quad. Part European Art-house, part formulaic actioner, it never quite gels in the way it should.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Just heard it for the first time, this is my new favorite album so far! Didn't think she could top her other albums, but Fiona did. I thought I liked other artists/ singer songwriters but after listening to The Idler Wheel. . . I see that no one comes close. Each song feels like the most important story of someone's life. Beautiful lyrics, I can't help but get emotional.  Thanks for writing again Fiona, it was worth the wait!
1475143389|5.0|I am giving this book five stars because it was exactly what I was looking and it helped break through my workout plateaus and it helped me put on muscle mass. The book contains a lot useful information on nutrition and how to use supplements effectively.  As opposed to previous weight training/bodybuilding books that I have read, that just simply tell you to eat six meals a day and one gram of protein per pound of body weight. This book on the other hand goes into great detail about how much fat, carbohydrates, protein and total calories you must consume in order to achieve the results you wish to attain, be it weight gain, weight loss or cutting. I also found this book easy to read and written in a concise manner. It is hands down the best book I have read on this subject and the most effective for getting results.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I bought this to pair my 6th gen iPod Classic with the Bose Soundlink portable speaker. After briefly trying to get it to connect and thinking it didn't work or wasn't compatible, I figured out how to connect it and it works great.<br /><br />All you do is hold the Bluetooth button down on the Soundlink for about 3 seconds until the flashing icon begins to flash more slowly, then insert the i10s into the iPod Classic. The i10s should begin flashing blue every few seconds, and then wait for the devices to pair- you'll hear a little chime. Took about 30-40 seconds the first time, and about 5-10 seconds every time after.<br /><br />I can be 30-40m away, easy, and it still works smoothly. Wears the battery down on the iPod a bit quicker than normal, but that's expected. It works perfectly, and I'm thrilled with it.

B00753MBHA|2.0|Well, in case you haven't heard any of these last 2 releases from Accept, Mark Tornillo is now the lead vocalist. It seems, based on how people rate this, is how much they like Mark Tornillo's vocals. If you've heard \\"Blood of the Nations\\", then you know what to expect here. If not, listen to that album first--it has some interesting tracks on it.<br /><br />However for me, Mark Tornillo's vocals wore thin after about 10 listens of Blood of the Nations, and after 2 listens of Stalingrad. His vocals just don't have that classic style of UDO. If you're hungry for better material, check out UDO's \\"Rev Raptor.\\" It came out in 2011 and already feels like a classic. I've listened to it multiple times and highly recommend it to ALL Accept & UDO fans!<br /><br />Accept \\"Blood of the Nations\\": 3 stars<br />Accept \\"Stalingrad\\": 2 stars<br />UDO \\"Rev Raptor\\": 5 STARS!!
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|This is definitely one of the Offspring's more energetic albums in a long time.  The standout tracks to me are The Future is Now, Secrets From the Underground, Dividing By Zero, Slim Pickins Does the Right Think and Rides the Bomb to Hell, and Dirty Magic, which is a totally re-recorded version of the song from Ignition and sounds great.  I Wanna Secret Family With You, Turning Into You, and Hurting As One are also good tracks.  This album contains a good mixture of songs with styles that span all of the eras of music of the Offspring.  Even with a few weak tracks such as Cruising California, which sounds a little too much like a summer pop song, and OC Guns, which is a mariachi/reggae influenced song about gangs from the OC, there's enough good tracks and enough diversity to make this album their best in a while.

B000IKAHN2|4.0|This episode, and the rest of the series, are great. However, when I was watching the first episode of this season I noticed that the screen would go black and I figured that a possible explanation was that it was in response to a commercial break. So, you'll watch up until a point when a commercial break will hit and then get stuck with a black screen, instead of watching commercials. Whilst not having to watch commercials is great getting stuck with a black screen for even 2 straight minutes is not, especially when people can compare Amazon Instant Video to Netflix. People, when watching something through this, or Netflix, usually are looking for the episode to play straight through with little or no delay. Meaning, no black screen at all. Personally, I think the people who uploaded these episodes needed to go over them and cut out the black parts. Worse still, I know because I've seen the entire series through Netflix, there is at least one part that was cut out in this series. There was a conversation between Major Shephard and a future friend soldier before he first went through the Stargate at Stargate Command on Earth where, I believe, Major Shephard asked how it felt going through. This was just one I found, there may or may not be others. I would hope not.<br />Whilst the fact that Amazon provided people with the Stargate Atlantis series is great and I'm very happy I can watch it through here I'd like it more if the people who loaned it, or whatever they did, kept everything that was in the series the way it was, but took out the black screen parts which may be commercial breaks. If they could mimic what Netflix did with the series I would give this series, on Amazon, five stars hands down, especially having HD as well, however, because of this I'm taking a star off.<br />Thank you Amazon for providing this series to us, but I would like a better job done if possible.<br />Edit: Someone else already spoke on this topic. Thanks to other person. However, thecut out of the talk between Major Shephard and the other guy in front of the Stargate was one I wanted to see so I'm still disappointed.

0099579936|1.0|Among the many other glaring problems pointed out in other reviews, I can't seem to pin down Ana's actual personality (does she have one?) or maturity level. She vacillates between sounding like a reasonably articulate but older than 21 or 22 year old adult in her emails and sounding like a 13-year-old girl in her own internal dialogue and narrative. How does one go from texting \\"I need sartorial advice\\" to the incessant \\"jeez!\\" \\"holy crap!\\" \\"oh my...\\" and other assorted inanities constantly running through her head? The implausible, stilted dialogue and poorly written characters are just one of many reasons to avoid this trilogy, or at the very least, read it with a critical eye and understand that this is a great example of what NOT to do/look for in quality writing.

It lasted a long time and I really like how there were hints you could use throughout the game. I don't know how I could've gotten through it otherwise. It actually was a dark game but well done and it kept me entertained on and off for several days. I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars cuz it took 3 tries to download and spontaneously closed out on me 3 or 4 times during play. It always saved close to my spot though so it wasn't a big deal. Worth the 99 cents especially if you have a newer phone and 4g

B004EPZ03O|5.0|This is not Sesame Street. It is rollicking nostalgia for those of us who grew up watching the original Muppet Show, complete with classic muppet witticisms and a coming-of-age story line. Watched this with my almost 8yr old, rough and tumble son, who immediately watched his favorite scenes again, and yet again the next day-- by which time he was singing along. The set, costumes and characters of \\"Smalltown\\" have a delightful 1950's  feel, the music is catchy, and the morals of the story are these: each of us has a special gift, and the people who count most are those right under our muppet noses-- treasure them!

0345803485|5.0|I don't know why everyone is complaining. Sure, it's not \\"Of Mice and Men\\", but that doesn't mean it isn't an amazing book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Many scenes made me blush (just like Ana in the book). And eventually I did get tired of her having multiple orgasms (mainly because I was a bit jealous). However, This was a great book to read in ones spare time. I think what is great about it is how people of all ages are reading it, including those who don't read about BDSM. It is a good book that looks at it in a light that most people wouldn't think of. Whats even more important, is the strong emotional connections the couple has with each other. This book isn't about sex. It's about Mr. Grey healing from his traumatizing childhood, which is a great process to read about.<br />This is why I read the trilogy, and that is why I loved it.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|This game crashes on both my ASUS tablet and my HTC EVO 3D phone.  Both of these devices are running Android 4.0.3 (ICS).  I'm guessing this game is REALLY not compatible with Android 4 or something because it really misbehaves even causing a reboot if not force killed fairly quickly.  Uninstalling for now but I'll check back to see if the bad bug(s) get fixed and give a better score when warrented.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this game is pretty neat. I like the way it has so many aspects of the game. as for the logging into facebook everyone is complaining about. log in once then when it says tap here to continue throughout the game just wait and the screen will clear and you wont have to put it on your facebook wall

B006QS0PF0|4.0|I thought the book was very courageous of her to share. It was an easy and engaging read, although my biggest complaint is that there wasnt more about the healing process, the growth. I wanted to learn more about how she recovered and what that struggle looked like. If she wrote part 2, I would certainly read it :)
0618001905|5.0|Anyone who has an interest in Africa needs to read this book. It is well written and engaging, and it educates the reader on why some of the current issues in Africa are like they are. Also, for anyone who is interested in media history, this book is a must as well. I gave this to my mother for birthday I liked it so much. Great history.<br /><br />Readers should be warned though. This book is very graphic. I had a hard time believing some of the things described actually happened untill I got to the photos in the middle of the book where they showed a photo of man holding the chopped off hands and feet of his daughter. This book is not for people who are prone to depression.

B007704HO6|5.0|I loved this story so much for both the cat and his companion.  This story read so true and every word was spoken to you as if a person or a cat was telling you this touching story in person.  I love animals and love stories about them, but this one is super special because this author comes so far in his life through his genuine love for this great cat.  This is touching, happy and inspiring.  A great read for children and adults.  The setting in London makes the story a great read too.  The author makes the city come alive for you within his beautiful story.  I read this book within two days and think of Bob often.  Enjoy!!!
097747609X|1.0|My critique is towards the publishers, not the contents of the book. Book description: \\"It is unknown exactly when the book was published but it was found in a prison camp which opened in 1938 and was liberated in 1945 so the book must have been published sometime during those dates.\\" - That's the fact that they're exploiting here and using to brand the old James Murphy version of Mein Kampf as \\"Official\\". All this is, is the same ol' Murphey edition branded as \\"Official\\", despite the fact that there's nothing official about any of \\"Murphey's Kampf\\"...which would make for a better name for his translations since he writes in so much of his own propaganda into the book.<br /><br />If you want the original (note: they couldn't call it original, because that would be a bold faced lie, they used subterfuge and called it 'official') get ETS Dugdales translation. He translated the original & OFFICIAL Mein Kampf (My Battle) in 1933. That's the only English version you could call \\"Official\\".

B007V508CC|5.0|After listening to this album, I am addicted to so many of the songs.  The comment on every one of their albums after SAJ, is that it's not saj.  Get over it!  This is a great album, with tunes you can dance to, groove to, and cry to.  It is really good, just give it a couple of listens.  After the second or third listen of the album, you'll be hooked!  And the bonus track \\"Kiss\\" is so awsome!  If you're a true Maroon 5 fan, or even if you're not, you won't be dissapointed!

B006RUJST6|5.0|This novel is worth the read for the poetry ALONE. I am in no way a poet. I don't even make it a point to read poetry, but the poetry is what made this book so beautiful in my eyes. I recommend this to anyone who has a strong appreciation for music, the meaning behind music, and creativity in general. I might be making this sound like a super artsy story, but that's just part of it. This story is about family, the strength to survive harships, and love...all forms of love. Read this! Then go read the sequal, which is just as good, if not better!
B007XWFZSA|5.0|This book is the best material for consulting prep, hands down. I have read case in point, wetfeet guides (Ace Your Case), crack the case, and Victor's material is the best. It covers the different kind of interviews in a simple, reliable way. It also gives you all the tools you need to solve the cases in structured, analytical and easy-to-follow steps. I would recommend this book over any of the other ones. Plus, it is cheap and many of the materials he refers to in his book, are for free in his website, which is very very generous.<br /><br />Maybe the only thing I would had liked is step-by-step explanation of cases, but the material provided is outstanding and enough to ace the interview.
B007OUFESC|4.0|This movie was generly under rated.  I did not see it in the theater, because I feared it was boring.  However, if you had to take Psych 101 in college, or know some of Freud and Jung's biographies, You might find  the movie fascinating, as I did.  Seeing these founders of PschoAnalysis, whatever you think of it, as real men, and set in their time, was interesting and not at all boring.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you're going to consider reading `The Song of Ice and Fire' series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren't for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring a great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Games of Thrones is able to deliver a very deep story targeting a mature audience because of this, though this also means the book's level of comprehension and adult content may become a deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you'll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time.<br /><br />As I previously said, the narrative of A Game of Thrones can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn't exactly paint a very big picture of what's to come. So I've decided to provide a brief synopsis of my own.<br /><br />With the murder of King Robert Baratheon's Hand `Jon Aryn', his Majesty himself has requested that his old friend Eddard Stark, head of House Stark take up the role at his side in King's Landing to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Eddard, `Ned' must leave the sanctity of Winterfell and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Lannister family. The book doesn't just follow the character Ned, but rather a large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Ned, others involve their own. Daenerys Targaryen, one of the last of the feared House Targaryen, is forced into a marriage with a savage Dothraki warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Ned's bastard son `Jon Snow' and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night's Watch', where desertion is punishable by death.<br /><br />While the plot of A Game of Thrones is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren't believable. George R. R. Martin has established himself as a very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Eddard Stark, the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Starks and the Lannisters. The Starks characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They're opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Lannister family, who seem like Martin's equivalent of the Borgia's. Though if there's a weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Lannister family. The Stark family makes up the bulk of the story's protagonists, but they aren't exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they're delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Lannister', we're given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Lannisters, while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Stark family.<br /><br />In a seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Starks, particularly the Stark children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they're among the victims in this malicious game that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safeor completely innocent.<br /><br />Even the world itself feels like a character that helps ground the reader in the author's fiction. Martin's `Seven Kingdoms' are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader a feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Martin's world a pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the `White Walkers' and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is a fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Seven Kingdoms feels like a realm that very much could have existed. It's an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings.<br /><br />There's going to be the inevitable comparison between Martin's work and the legacy left behind by Tolkien as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Martin's writing is completely different from Tolkien's in nearly every angle. Tolkien emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in a fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Martin on the other hand is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable', while others stand atop a pedestal as paragons of altruism.  But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they're ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Martin chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They're not the great heroes Tolkien illustrated; they're morally ambiguous human beings. That's the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Martin isn't trying to replicate Tolkien but rather make his own beast.<br /><br />Yet, I never like to jump on a bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that a novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I'm not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they're all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I'm referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn't mention this, but with a book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of a proper climax to the story. I'm all for having an intriguing plot over a mindless slog of action scenes, but with a book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with a bang. It's little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good.<br /><br />When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Harry Potter novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of a skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating a television show made me raise an eyebrow, \\"instead of making a movie they're going to milk it with a whole season of episodes\\" I thought. After reading A Game of Thrones, I realized that making a television show out of the book isn't just a good idea, it's absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that a movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It's the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don't exactly have many of those.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate George R. R.

1612130283|1.0|I'm SHOCKED that this piece of trash is so popular.  It was the worst book I've ever heard/read (I had audio book version).  I'd have so much more respect and confidence in humanity if people were just reading the erotica parts.  But they are actually reading the whole book!  I cannot believe our society has this many dullards in it. How can this be?  For god's sake, pick up an Anais Nin or Henry Miller erotic book!<br /><br />It was excruciating, I tried to listen to it as long as could, but I couldn't stand it anymore. I got to the first red room scene, really?  That's it?  This is what the hype is about?  I felt like I was tricked into listening, kept thinking \\"it has to get better, there's no way it can stay this bad and still have been on bestseller lists.  I had to stop listening.  I felt extreme anger with the repetitive, juvenile prose, I wanted to pummel both the protagonist and the author.  I felt like it must be a joke, that this is a new form of completely NOT FUN S&M in itself, to keep torturing you with \\"oh crap!\\" \\"double crap!\\" \\"holy crap!\\" \\"holy hell!\\" \\"oh my!\\" \\"long fingers\\" \\"grey eyes\\" \\"flushed\\" \\"blushed\\" verbiage.  Horrific verbiage and writing, no plot or character development, completely implausible storyline even with suspended belief in place.<br /><br />Please, somebody help me make sense of the following:<br />(1) It's horribly written and edited... how was it possibly published and successful?<br />(2) How can people stand to read it when it sounds like it's written by an illiterate, untalented teenage girl?<br />(3) Are there really that many people unable to distinguish between good, bad, and excruciating writing?<br />(4) Does this mean that people must not actually read any other books as a point of reference?<br />(5) People LOVED it.  How can people have such a complete lack of taste?<br />(6) Why isn't this being ripped apart by book reviews/critics?<br /><br />The \\"mommy porn\\" hype: how boring and pathetic their lives and sex must be if they can stomach this book in order to get a little thrill.  BTW, I read the Twilight books, so I'm not a book snob.  They were entertaining mindless beach novels, but they weren't horrible.  Hot vampire and werewolf boys are more believable than 21 year old virginal college lit majors with no computer/email.

B005TMSN4E|5.0|This gets 5 stars because it works and it seems well made especially with the inclusion of the tripod foot.  That's what you want when you buy something, right?  Well made and that it works?  Good price, of course, and I guess this is a bit pricey.  But if you have a good supply of Nikon lenses and you want to put them on your V1...well, then this price is exactly what it should be.<br /><br />However, bear in mind that the V1 and the Nikon 1 line in general is meant to be small and portable.  You throw a full size lens on there via the adapter and you got one heavy setup.  If you own those lenses you probably already own a DSLR so why not just stick with that?  It makes the V1 less usable.  It also taxes the AF system (presuming you have the right lenses that will auto focus at all - manual focus is fine, but only AF-S lenses will AF).  The Nikon 1 AF system just isn't designed to for the kind of environments that you're used to using your other lenses.  For instance...I routinely use my DSLR in dim lighting and the higher-end AF system, combined with a lens that can let in more light (1.8, 2, etc) lets me get the job done.  The V1 uses contrast based focusing only and therefore can hunt a bit.  My 105mm Macro almost never focuses, just goes from infinity to nearest focus back and forth.  My other lenses work fine and in good light they all work fine. But, again, it's not designed for this.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.7 crop factor is a huge change.  You put a 50mm on there, it's suddenly a 130 something millimeter lens.  You go from a good portrait lens to maybe a head shot.  More like \\"half a head shot.\\"  You need to put something pretty wide on there to get what you want in terms of perspective.<br /><br />Then again, I can still see myself using this often.  I go on a trip and bring the V1 with my 3 lenses and a flash.  I want perhaps the option of using a really fast lens on it that I already own.  I can now do that with this adapter, and I've brought just thatone lens rather than a whole kit with DSLR.<br /><br />But unlike reviews that give low stars due to personal issues or relative usefulness...it's still useful, and it's well made and it works as advertised.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|I don't think that this is quite my favorite movie, but I must admit, its about as close to perfect as a movie can be. There are several maybe three or four scenes in this movie that are flawless and perfectly intense; specifically the scene where the SS man is interrogating a dairy farmer and the scene in the bar with the German actress/spy.The scene in the bar is really and truly one of the greatest scenes in film history. Historically, this should be the scene everyone thinks about when discussing Tarnatino's legacy. This is the best movie I've seen by Tarantino, FAR better than Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies, which were damn good, better even than Jacki Brown. This is Tarantino's masterpiece.

B00275EGWY|1.0|This movie is basically Norah Jones, you know the one they told us was such a great musician as they also informed us she was Ravi Shankar's daughter(OMG RAVI SHANKAR'S DAUGHTER!) Seriously, the is was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I am quite convinced that the Teri Gross crowd only gave it the serious praise it received because it had a female director. The fix was in. Someone sent word down the chain of command that any reviewer seeking future promotion had better love this movie.The first thing that set off the warning bells was the purpose of the black second in command. he starts the movie off not knowing how to resolve a problem with his robot, which was instantly fixed by his white superior. O.K. no biggie, but then it continues with his next superior, who goes into all kinds of danger unnecessarily while the black guy is panicking in his ear-piece. Basically this is white male macho validation.Thats what the movie is.The white guy is Crockett, the black guy is tubbs.Thats how it starts out. They might have got together after this sniper incident they solved together, but by then it was too late. Last night I saw a GREAT war movie, Inglorious Basterds, by comparison this movie should have been straight to DVD.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|When a movie receives this many middling to negative reviews, curiosity gets the better of me and I just have to see for myself how bad it is.<br /><br />It was obvious at the outset what was wrong with this movie, a decided lack of conviction on everyone's part.  The actors didn't seem to believe in their roles and gave lack luster performances.  The dialog was painfully witless.  The circumstances involved were all rushed, checked off like a to-do list.  The aliens were less than awe-inspiring.  The special effects were few and far between and limited in scope.  Everything was so distant, including every shot in the film.  Did someone fail to remember that close-ups serve the purpose of drawing us in; distant shots put everything out of reach?  If even only one \\"kill\\" shot was done with a close-up, there might have been a better sense of the brutality involved.  We'd at least see an expression on a face instead of a few nameless people literally being snuffed out of existence.  The deaths were all remote and removed, most done off-screen.  People weren't kept around long enough so few personalities stood out, which meant that no deaths were mourned.  I forgot everyone's name within minutes.  Nothing in this film mattered, that's the point they were missing.  They made that plain from the instant those two idiots walked into a boardroom and failed to confront the guy who stole their idea.  \\"You stole our idea?  Oh, okay, whatever, let's go to a club.\\"  And even when the thief shows up at the very same club (there must be only one in all of Moscow), they still failed to hash out their grievances.  No swearing, no coming to blows, instead, they all trooped outside to watch the pretty lights!<br />No sense of urgency, no sense of awe, no suspense, no horror, no thrills; everything was handled in a perfunctory manner.  It ended with a whimper rather than the stirring battle cry it required.  Even the score was plain and unmemorable!<br /><br />It takes an awful lot of incompetence to screw up an intriguing concept like this one had going for it.<br />I'm not sorry I watched it, but it would be pointless to watch it again.incompetence to screw up an intriguing concept like this one had going for it.<br />I'm not sorry I watched it, but it would be pointless to watch it again.

0446572993|4.0|Last August I wasn't too happy with my favorite spy/thriller writers and voiced my dismay in a review of [[ASIN:0312374879 The Tourist]] by Olen Steinhauer:<br /><br />Lately, my favorite spy, espionage, thriller writers have gotten a bit boring. Vince Flynn writes thrillers after the fact which makes them alternative history, Tom Clancy has forsaken Jack Ryan, David Baldacci is writing cute (last one was a Nicholas Sparks with a happy ending). The only thing Alex Berenson wrote that I enjoyed was his 2008 review in NY Times of THE GIRL WITH THE GOLDEN TATTOO. I only read Daniel Silva's Allon series when stolen or forged art is involved, and Brian Haig has stopped writing his Sean Drummond series at the bequest of his publisher BUT I found a new author that I'm currently reading...<br /><br />Ten months later I'm a happy camper again having just finished the second of the last two thrillers by David Baldacci....and he's forgiven: no more Camel Club nor summer romance \\"stuff\\"  He has created two new hero spies...John Puller in [[ASIN:1455518999 Zero Day]] and now Will Robie in THE INNOCENT.<br /><br />In a way Will Robie of THE INNOCENT is the more exciting hero! He's a clandestine assassin for the USA who falters on his last kill. He teams up with a 14-year old bright gal, a runaway from foster homes...and an attractive female FBI agent...and seriously considers dating a lovely gal who lives in his apartment complex in Washington, D.

0393088774|5.0|One doesn't need a PhD in economics to understand this book.  It would help to be familiar with Economics 101 perhaps, but not much more.  Krugman is convincing arguing for more government stimulus, a higher inflation rate, and more effective regulations.  If you want a Nobel Prize winner's take on how to fix the economy, this is the book for you.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|From June 5, 2012 to September 16, 2012 the Cummer Museum of Art here in Jacksonville, Florida, has a special art exhibition called MIRADAS: Ancient Roots in Modern and Contemporary Mexican Art: Works from the Bank of America Collection.<br /><br />After I saw the exhibition last week, I rented a dvd of this 2002 Academy-Award nominated movie of FRIDA, starring the extraordinary actress Salma Hayek. The movie is based on the life of Frida Kahlo, the famed Mexican artist, who was married at the age of 22 to her mentor and much-older friend Diego Riviera, Communist, mural painter, philanderer...perhaps the most recognizable Mexican artist in the world.<br /><br />The movie FRIDA is as extraordinary as Salma Hayek's performance. The colors, the architectural structures and sets, the special visual effects, the costumes, and the music are spectacular.  The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won for best original score and best makeup.<br /><br />Please do not buy this one disc edition of Frida. For $3 more you may purchase the two disc set with a whole disc of special features including conversations and commentary by the talented director Julie Taymor (who directed the stage version of THE LION KING) and actress Salma Hayek, a biography of Kahlo, special visual effects pieces... all with the haunting Mexican music in the background. The ISBN for the two disc set is 0-7888-4498-9. Putting this ISBN in Amazon's search engine will take you to the set. (While you are at the two disc set page...please read Mark Barry's excellent and glowing 5 star review that relates many biographical tidbits and lists all the wonderful features.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of Kahlo's works are in the 95 piece collection at the Cummer. There is one small photo or black/white portrait of her that recalled this movie. Fortunately, I have time to revisit the exhibition and view that small, framed, and special picture of FRIDA!

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is fun.  makes the time go by real fast. you don't get bored with this, there are so many games.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Collen Hoover created an amazing tale of heartbreak and love. I simply could not put this book down. If you like to feel something when you read, then get this book.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|I received my \\"new\\" copy several days after I had ordered it.  Upon receiving it I noticed that the \\"holder\\" for the dvd cd broke which left the cd rolling around inside the case if it was handled rough.  Also, I noticed a \\"splash\\" pattern on the disk.  Nevertheless, the product works fine despite the cosmetic mishaps and I would recommend it to anyone who \\"abides\\".
0345803485|1.0|It is amazing what people become fascinated with, and how this 'book' is rising to fame. What an awful example of American culture.<br /><br />It is not, by any means, worth the paper it is printed on. This is one of the most abusive and demeaning books about sexual relationships published. Women don't seem to understand what garbage this book is, and how poorly it actually describes BDSM. Poorly written, barely edited, the book appears to be written by a person challenged by the proper use of English language.<br /><br />Awful. Just awful.
B006P4FBUE|1.0|Description says not for serious musician! Should have been in RED BOLD type. The sound is simply awful. The graphics and ergonomics are very good but..... turn the sound off to play???? 99cents and no refund?.....what a rip
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|loads of fun, good graphics! very entertaining. not too hard but does present challenges. always like g5 games. thanks for making it!
B007U1FEJE|3.0|It's been said that the Beach Boys were the first band to infuse Four Freshmen-style harmonies with the rock n' roll rhythms of Chuck Berry.  While I greatly enjoyed the title song, which features some of the best production work of Brian Wilson in years and great vocals by everyone involved, the rest of the album is \\"lite rock\\" and underproduced in comparison.  The beat of each song sounds stuck at mid-tempo, the keyboards dominate, and the drums are mixed way up front.  Too bad the Boys couldn't have fired off one last rocker like \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" or \\"I Get Around.\\"  Yeah, I know they're old guys now, but still....  If you're a long-time fan like me and have some spare change, go ahead and buy it.  If not, download the title song.  No doubt in years to come, it will be the final selection on Beach Boys Greatest Hits albums.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|possibly more enjoyable as a kid than as an adult. Objects are hidden well but not ridiculous, over all game is fun
B0050XFY4O|5.0|From Beginning to End is not at all a modern American movie, it's an ambitious and beautiful foreign film, Ingmar Bergman-esque in its pacing, lighting, attention to detail, and full-body acting. Light to Bergman's dark, still it explores an almost-Greek myth of two brothers who become two halves of one person.<br /><br />The parents worry about it, then accept it. With a minimum of dialogue, the characters convey their complex emotions in long close-ups, moments where you absorb their emotion until you feel what the characters themselves are feeling. The movie requires you to participate in the characters' emotions, rather than just feeding you plot.<br /><br />The look is slightly artificial and stylized, beautifully lit, with everything beautifully displayed: the water, the clothes, the interiors, the bodies. Some scenes are breathtakingly erotic, again with a Bergman-esque feel. Such as the scene when the brothers are finally alone as adults after their mother's funeral. They disrobe one piece at a time turn-by-turn, facing each other, leaving no question that they are both choosing to take the next, socially out-of-bounds, step.<br /><br />The film has a surprisingly light touch where it would be easy to be heavy. The scene where the dead mother appears to join the adult brothers at the beach is heart-wrenching as you begin to absorb the implications, but is also very sweet and natural.<br /><br />I expected this to be more of a gay film, but From Beginning to End transcends the genre completely, despite the beautifully erotic scenes between the lovers. It is simply an excellent film in the tradition of Ingmar Bergman. A film that strikes you with its restrained (and not-so-restrained) passion, its intelligence, and a sophisticated sensibility that stirs things up but leave you to find your own answers. It's not a particularly comfortable film, and that is a large part of its beauty: you really aren't quite sure what to think about what you've seen. But you will be glad that you have seen it.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun for a quick game. addictive and gets more fun with time. good for a busy mom who only has a minute
B0061QD7YS|5.0|It's Disney, if they do it wrong, the world is a bad place.  Blu-Ray quality was top notch.  Story is still good.
B008469DGY|5.0|This fun game is easy to control and very addictive.  best part? FREE and fun.  download it today or be sorry.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|Wow, this is why they fired this guy from Harry Potter.  He can't take a book with a ton of scenery and character development and make it into a movie.  I know it is a kids book, but the director bombed this one.  Too bad there will not be sequels because the books are great.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|After 2 days of trying to find a WiFi source since my 4g isn't good enough I painfully waited for the game to download so I could see why it was rated so high. Much to my disappointment it is no better than the countless other find the object games on here, yet they all have much worse reviews?? Amazon's WiFi policy is ingenious!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Its the BEST Most Funest game in the hole appstore!<br />I play it all the time I love it!!!!!!!! u have to get the game.<br />Nathan Gruss.
B007STBUIW|5.0|What can I say about \\"Jaws\\" that hasn't already been said a thousand times?<br /><br />It is a cinematic masterpiece. A perfect marriage of mystery, suspense, action, horror, and romance. Yes, I said romance. The romance of Chief Brody and his wife Ellen. The romance of Hooper and the ocean, and even the romance of Quint and the shark. Hell, there's even a romantic element of the mayor with the town of Amity.<br /><br />The film is a breathtaking homage to Hitchcockian thrillers. A psychological scarer that still makes people hesitate to go into the water, 37 years AFTER its initial release. It taps into our deepest, darkest fears about not knowing what is out there, the unseen leviathan in the depths and darkness, lurking, just waiting for its chance to attack.<br /><br />\\"Jaws\\" was my favorite film as a child and still ranks as one of my all-time greatest films. It does so many things right, that it's hard to find flaws or pick at small imperfections. It is said that had the shark worked half of the time, that Spielberg would have produced a completely different picture. The shortcomings of the mechanical shark \\"Bruce\\", which at the time seemed like a detriment, might have saved the film from becoming just another monster movie aimed at making big bucks at the summer box office. The sharks failure to work on many occasions forced Spielberg to employ different methods of shooting scenes, choosing instead to imply the presence of the shark using unique angles and water-level camera shots, thus creating an instance where the audience had to creat the shark in their own minds, which is far more frightening than seeing the creature on film. Alfred Hitchcok famously spoke about the essence of suspense and horror. He described a scene showing a man being held at gunpoint, and two different ways of showing the same scene. In on scene, the man with the gun holds the gun, and shortly after pulls the trigger, firing a bullet into the man and killing him. The second scene shows the man being held up, but this time we see the gun and focus on the cocked hammer and the gunmans trigger finger, trembling on the trigger. The suspense builds and builds and builds, yet the man does not fire. Hitchcock further explained that the firing of the gun, although progressing the story, releases the audience from the suspense, and it is Hitchcock's goal to keep his audience in suspense and thus is the reason why he would not let the gunman pull the trigger in the scene. Sometimes, it's scarier to imagine the hunter than actually seeing it, and that is what makes \\"Jaws\\" such an amazing film.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray throws the experience into 2nd gear. Words can not describe how nice this transfer looks. It's not quite as good as current high definition film transfers, but considering we're talking about a movie that was filmed nearly 40 years ago, the blu-ray picture is amazing. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the fine detail that is present is incredible. I have personally seen 'Jaws' well over 100 times in my lifetime and I can easily say that the film has NEVER looked better.
0425263908|5.0|Just because the mans rich doesnt mean this book is a rip of 50. Although i did love the trilogy, the plot to this book is more captivating and the man charcter more relatable. The characters in this book are more interesting and the writing was more than what i would have expected, I enjoyed this book and loved the story line. Can't wait for the next one.
0525478817|5.0|This book is probably one of my favorite books. The characters are so utterly believable, and the plot moves at break-neck speeds. The entire book was rife with the intensity of the dying and the vitality of the living. Never have I felt more connected to a book on the very first page.  I'm not a huge review-writer, but I had to address some of the negative comments I saw. One review said that Green treated his characters more like metaphors than characters, while another said that nobody talks in the verbose, poetic way that they do. I would have to disagree. Because of Hazel's and Augustus's diseases, they have grown up more than kids their age. And while yes, their dialogue is very mature even for some adults, it is because they are searching for meaning behind the little things, because they will never go on to see the big things. They are experts in overanalyzing everything as a way of coping with not being able to  live their lives to the fullest.  The fake book inside the book, An Imperial Affliction, was genuis, the story was lyrical, the characters were hilarious, and it left me crying at the end. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who doesn't mind a tragic story.  I can't wait to read everything else John Green has come out with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I know it's me...but doing the profile...it seem your plan know exactly what I need to read<br /><br />very pleased with this app
B007H9B8FS|4.0|It took me a couple of listens before I started enjoying the album, but now I'm really into it. At first it seemed a little old hat, but I appreciate that they didn't try to change the formula simply to be new and different. It's Garbage. They're back. And I'm glad they are.
B007SGM084|5.0|I didn't but the Trilogy but I would have. Words escape me as what to truely say other then get to reading! Reading is in my opinion the best escape and WOW what an escape reading these three book were!
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|UPDATE:  So my review has completely changed from its original state. After two listens, I hated the album. Only during the 3rd listen (which I undertook b/c of the responses I got to my review) did I begin to enjoy the album. Now, after several listens I can say that I \\"get\\" it. I was so distracted by the bareness of the instrumentals at first that it was hard for me to take in the artistry of the album. I still like _When the Pawn_ and _Extraordinary Machine_ better, but this album is well-crafted. It's the type of album where you discover lyrics and sounds you didn't notice before on each listen. I recommend it to seasoned Fiona fans, and if you're new to her music give this at least 3 listens before you judge it. I'm leaving my original review so that you can witness my shift in opinion.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: I've only listened to Idler twice, and I don't plan to listen more. I had to force myself to give it a second try. I consider myself a fairly big Fiona Apple fan--ever since Tidal--and this is a huge disappointment. The lyrics (and even melodies) aren't bad, but the musicality is horrendous. None of the instrumentation is pleasing to my ears. It's grating and unnerving, which may be the point, but it's not something to which I enjoy submitting myself. And being such a fan, writing this makes me sad. (I considered giving this album 2 stars because the opening and closing songs show promise, but my disappointment won't let me.) My current recommendations are Delta Rae's Carry the Fire and Garbage's Not Your Kind of People.
B0081GWXPA|1.0|I have never read The Little Prince. Maybe if I had, I would have understood some of this poor translation. As short as the book is, I could not get through it. From misuse of pronouns, to lacking verbs, to simple punctuation and capitalization problems, this book is so full of errata, I could not understand it. Here's an excerpt: \\"As I had never drawn a sheep So &lt;sic> I drew for him one of the two pictures as I could. He closed the boa. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it.\\" This was the only translation available for Kindle, so even though I had read the previous reviews (all bad), I thought I would try it, for convenience sake. I had convinced myself that their complaints had been about nuances of language--WRONG! It reads as if someone used old translation software to turn this original French masterpiece into this disaster. I was able to get a refund the same day. Thank you, Amazon.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I know many long term fans (like myself) have been rather confused by Rush's recent albums.<br /><br />Simply, this is their best album since Counterparts. Test for Echo, Vapor Trails and Snakes and Arrows were all sub-standard albums (fatally dull, sadly). Not quite sure what happened, but the guys were inspired on this one, and made a great collection of songs. I had all but given up on them, but this album has certainly restored the faith.<br /><br />I do hope they play the whole thing on tour.<br /><br />For those on the fence, I can confirm that as a long-term grumpy fan, this one is a winner.
0345803485|1.0|I thought I was missing something because of all the hype about this book.  I'm on Chapter 18 and basically skim thru the pages.  I just don't get it at all.  Still waiting for a plot.  Glad I borrowed the book and didn't pay for it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|now I understand why there are so many reviews for this game.  give me my extra points already.  ive run out of thongs to say.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I just love the MagicPuzzles app. There are many choices for puzzles with the variety of packs that are included in the download. in addition to those puzzle packs you can download more-some free and some paid. I also love that you can change from a few pieces in a puzzle to hundreds of pieces.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game. its very addicting and very detailed with the design. I do think that way too many people are overreacting.it does her boring when you play it so much though.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is the closest game to mincraft on the kindle.but this is not mincraft. if you wont mincraft get it on the ipod. don't assuume this is mincraft because you make stuff with blocks and everything are blocks. sorry I mean minecraft.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I picked this book purposesly because it was out of my comfort zone (usually period pieces).  I was blown away by the story, the characters and the writing.  I finished this days ago but it is still lingering in my thoughts.  This is a book that pulls you in and won't let go.  I loved the characters - likeable and unlikeable all at the same time.  I can't wait to read another book by this author.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me reading and reading. I could not stop. The premise is new and refreshing. Having children fight to survive, even kill. This is something new that most people don't even want to think about, but the author does a splendid job with it. By adding humor and love to the story. Who will Katniss love in the end?
B007WEYGPC|5.0|The online reading group I belong to chose this book as a group read for June in the Classic category. I had read it many years ago when I was in high school but I doubt I had the appreciation of it that I have now reading it as an adult.<br /><br />It is both a coming of age story of a brother and sister and the engrossing tale of their father set in a small southern town. It is the story of a simple man who strives to do the right, if challenging, thing on a daily basis both in his home and as a citizen of his community. In doing so he must face the ignorance and bigotry of the times they live in.<br /><br />The novel is timeless and truly a classic.
B005HSL626|4.0|here's the deal I absolutely love this app its slightly addictive and really fun, but one day I had only one thing to unlock and the game wouldn't open in the end I wound up having to uninstall and reinstall the app loosing all my memory
B007TG34QU|5.0|Aside from the marvelous musicianship and the unsurpassed recording quality, I was completely taken by the feeling that everyone involved was having a really good time.  Whether you typically enjoy music from this era or not, you will find yourself awash in music that is both invigorating and relaxing.  I have listened to these discs over and over again.  I absolutely agree with Mr. Ludvik when he suggests that you buy this one immediately.  You'll be hooked after the first cut!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really good even though it seems repetitive at times. its a great time waster and its great for long car rides. and if you really don't like the game then do play it IT'S FREE FOR PETE'S SAKE!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I waited a while before I tried &quot;temple run&quot; didn't think I would like it but I have been pleasantly surprised.
1907590099|3.0|Not bad, but definitely disappointing. The beginning of the book is a chronicle of an entheogenic experience not that much better than those that can be found at erowid. Or at least not as better as the intellectual weight of the author might lead one to expect. Perhaps this is unavoidable when talking about the unspeakable. Later the author makes a series of very well-made and articulated points about the relation between mind-altering substances and society. The particular edition I read is also greatly improved by the presence of supplementary material (reviews, commentary, fragments of other books, etc.)
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is perfect for me I love animals but sometimes the epics are bad so I put them in the pic shop
