B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|Was unhappy with this game. Downloaded on Kindle Fire and game jammed , or froze, and there is no instructions with the game. Seems to let the player figure out, for him or her self, how to operate the monkey and everything else involved with the game. To bad there is no update for this game. Maybe its not compatible with Kindle.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|John Grisham has a style all of his own which makes his books interesting with well described details of what his characters are up to and what they can accomplish.
174179918X|1.0|I bought the Kindle edition of this book and tried to use it in Korea.<br /><br />It's sassy and fresh but nearly useless.<br /><br />The maps are misleading.<br /><br />The history sections are trivial.<br /><br />The images don't scale.<br /><br />This book is dreadful,<br />as is Lonely Planet China.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I loved this book...being a fan of hitchcock since I was a teenager...seen all of his movies...My favorite being psycho ...This story is about the making of this movie..all the difficulties it  hitchcock encountered...to get this movie  made
1401235425|5.0|Overall a great mystery and great use of Gotham as a character in and of itself. Highly recommended for Batman fans and fans of all his associated characters, Nightwing in particular.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We had missed this movie when it first was out and seeing there is now a 'Red 2' about to be released, I came across this movie while trying to find something to watch at home on a slow tv night.  We laughed throughout the whole movie!  It was over the top shooting and explosions but the movie never took itself too seriously.  All of the lead actors had their tongues placed firmly in their cheeks as they played their over the top characters!  It's a fun movie... I would definitely recommend it!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right amount of challenge to keep me coming back, but not too much to frustrate me and make me turn away.
B00838HRP2|1.0|This dvd did not arrive for 2 months - I complained - the dvd arrived a week later - the dvd would not play -  message on the screen said &#34;playback prohibited by area&#34; -  was this a pirated dvd?  I returned  the dvd - was  given a refund - no explanation of what that message meant - I will never buy from this vender again.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I enjoyed this book highly. And I can't wait to read more of the series. I expect this series to be one of my favorites.
1619692376|1.0|This story was  verbose and confusing - I didn't finish it - very unusual for me.  I can't think of anyone I would recommend it to.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|1,418 reviews!  Well, here's one more.  I found myself wanting to pick up the book often to keep reading and see what happens in the story.  I like stories of simple, rural people. I always loved James Herriot's books and also the Hamish Macbeth series.  Usually I don't like books that have chapters jumping around, but this one was ok.  The author is a very skilled writer, but sometimes I felt she over-described settings, like the McFadden's house decor.  Good book!

006220629X|3.0|Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres has managed to put his dark and painful past behind him and move on with a quiet, happy life with his friends the Semperes, who run a used bookstore in Barcelona, and his fiancee, Bernarda. But one day a man walks into the bookshop and brings the past rushing back, colliding with the present.<br /><br />Ferm&iacute;n had tried to protect Daniel Sempere from the full story of what he went through during the days of the Spanish Civil War, including his time in prison. But he now tells the young man everything, including information that directly relates to Daniel's own history, and Daniel must make a choice about how he will handle what he has learned.<br /><br />Zafon tells readers that this third book in the \\"cycle of novels set in the literary universe of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" is, like the previous two books, \\"an independent, self-contained tale.\\" Since I have read the other two, I must disagree. Readers would miss out on meaning in this book if they read it first. This is also the shortest and weakest of the series, standing alone. But readers who have enjoyed Zafon's other masterful tales will appreciate the information he supplies in this book.<br /><br />- Also posted to Sacramento/San Francisco Book Review

0142422010|5.0|Seventeen-year-old Lola has it pretty good. She lives in an old Victorian house in the Castro area of San Francisco with two loving fathers, gets to follow her passion of design by creating fun costume-y clothes to wear every day, and has a dream boyfriend: Max, a hot 22-year-old rock singer. Then one day the neighbors move back in to their house after being gone for two years, and she must face Cricket Bell, the very cute and talented guy who broke her heart. Isn't she over him now? Did he ever care for her -- and could he still?<br /><br />Author Stephanie Perkins crafts another utterly charming tale of young love, complete with quirky, delightful characters. After her debut novel, Anna and the French Kiss, her second book doesn't disappoint: in fact, it even brings back Anna and St. Clair from that book as Lola's co-workers at a movie theater. The plot devices in this book are similar to those of the first, but Perkins can be forgiven for that because her stories are just so fun to read. Plus, those who live in the city (or just like to visit a lot) will enjoy all the great references to San Francisco.<br /><br />-Also posted to the Sacramento/San Francisco Book Review

1400069807|4.0|This book isn't meant to be an indictment of the way America eats; really, it's an indictment of the food industry and how carefully it has engineered its products and orchestrated its marketing practices to get consumers hooked on its salt-, sugar-, and fat-laden goods. Moss takes us through an explanation and history of each big ingredient, showing readers how each contributes to the taste and feel of processed food and why it is so difficult for us as consumers to stop eating--and, perhaps worse, why the \\"food giants\\" can't unhook themselves from these additives.<br /><br />\\"If sugar is the methamphetamine of processed food ingredients, with its high-speed, blunt assault on our brains, then fat is the opiate, a smooth operator whose effects are less obvious but no less powerful.\\"<br /><br />Sugar is a taste everyone craves: studies show babies are born liking sweetness. Scientists have also calculated the \\"bliss point\\" at which sweetness is at the perfect level for various people and foods, and they use that information to make beverages and foods (even those that aren't what we'd consider inherently \\"sweet\\") perfectly tempting. Unfortunately for a nation that is facing an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, sugar isn't just for sweetening: it influences aroma, appearance, and texture. It's also not just those unpronounceable chemical preservatives that extend shelf life; sugar factors in as well.<br /><br />Of course, Moss explores the world of soda production and sales. Carbonated drinks loaded with sugar and high fructose corn syrup have long been a target of groups trying to improve the nation's health. Cereal, too, is a big culprit when it comes to sugar-laden foods consumed in huge doses by adults and kids alike, which may come as more of a surprise to some readers.<br /><br />Fat's status as culinary villain won't come as any surprise either. But what might stun some readers as they learn about the science behind our bodies' interactions with fat is that there is no \\"bliss point\\" for fat as there is for sugar. We will eventually put the brakes on our eating when we get to our limit for sweetness, but fat can be much more insidious. We don't necessarily hit a limit because our brains can't always tell how much fat we've eaten.<br /><br />Fat is much like sugar in that it doesn't just provide (or, in this case, deliver) a flavor hit or the ideal \\"mouth feel\\"; it also allows processed foods to sit on shelves longer, and it provides texture, bulk, and tenderness to all kinds of products. And again, just as with sugar, the big food companies' scientists have learned just how they can use fat to the best advantage in all kinds of products, not just to deliver the most powerful flavor, but to make consumers keep coming back for more and more. They know that with a product like potato chips, \\"Betcha Can't Eat Just One\\" isn't just a marketing slogan; it's a fact.<br /><br />Salt is the last insidious ingredient Moss explores, and the third that makes potato chips just the irresistible waistline-expander that they are. As Moss says, \\"potato chips are not the poster child for junk food; they are the epitome of processed foods generally, which use salt, sugar, and fat, sometimes interchangeably, to maximize their appeal to consumers.\\" Salt is a cheap ingredient that is readily available to food companies and in all kinds of forms that produce the best reactions in people's mouths and systems.<br /><br />Overall, even though the food giants would like to provide healthier options to consumers, sometimes for the common good but also to ward off lawsuits and federal regulation, their best efforts have generally failed. Foods with fewer of the big three additives just don't taste as good or sell as well. And, as Moss concludes, \\"It's simply not in the nature of these companies to care about the consumer in an empathetic way. They are preoccupied with other matters, like crushing their rivals, beating them to the punch.... In the heat of competition, they look past the health impact of their products. The soda industry has been particularly adept in the department of willful blindness.\\"<br /><br />In the end, Moss writes, the idea of consumers \\"seizing control (of eating and purchasing habits) in order to ward off an unhealthy dependence on processed food seems like the best--and only--recourse we have. The companies are not going to save us. The government is not going to save us. Only we can save us.\\"<br /><br />A fascinating book that more consumers must read.<br /><br />- Also posted to Sacramento/San Francisco Book Reviewe heat of competition, they look past the health impact of their products.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun game. Kept my daughter busy for hours. Good graphics and challenging puzzles. Would definitely recommend to all puzzle lovers
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was looking forward reading this! The topic was appealing and the millions sales a reassurance. The book started nicely, I was hooked immediately however when I reach the 50th page or so I started to wonder why the characters looked so much like the ones in the \\"Twilight\\" movies. Also, the writer was repeating everything over and over. The whole book started to look as a corny fanfiction written by a 16 years old girl. Don't get me wrong, I love fan fiction (yes, no shame :)) but the writing and the story was turning retarded and I had to stop reading! Then I found out the writer is in her 50s and the whole book started as a Twilight fan fiction indeed! I was in awe.<br /><br />I dont don't want to sound snobbish because I'm just an average reader, but this book was unbearable! I have read better fanfiction than this. (Please excuse my grammar my native language is spanish)
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|It was a good movie, but I expected more. Such a classic movie, thought they would have done a bit more with the remake.
0062255657|5.0|A sweet, easy read.  Nothing new or startling for Gaiman or in the manner in which the story unfolds.  Just a well-crafted exploration of fantasy overlapping with mortality.  From the menace of Ursula Monkton, to the shocking transitions within the main characters own family - the writing is deft and to the point.  The anchor of the three Hempstock women called to mind the things I love about Madeleine L'Engle's books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I guess with the success of Temple Run and TR2, others will try to imitate it.  Still fun and kids enjoy it.  If you like TR and TR2, then give it a try.
1451695187|5.0|I am thankful that the good doctor was able to document this amazing story. This book offers a great deal of hope and comfort on the topic of death.

0399162097|5.0|Seldom have I read a book with more humor and compassion combined. The narrator, Rosemary, is a completely unique character who, like many brainy kids, doesn't fit in too well. But she happens also to have been raised with a chimp until she was five years old, and therefore has a few more quirks than most nerdy kids. I read somewhere a long time ago, and therefore don't remember where, that D. H. Lawrence believed the main purpose of literature was to expand readers' sympathy for people who, at first glance, are nothing like us. Well, Fern, Rosemary's chimp twin, is supposedly less like us than just about anyone we've ever met between the pages of a book, but I doubt that anyone will close its covers without having shed many tears for her, and a world in which animals as intelligent and capable of \\"human\\" emotion can be owned.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I grew up watching the original Star Trek series with my mom, who just loves corny, old shows, with my father shouting in disgust every time he walked through the living room, &#34;That's not possible!&#34; I even watched William Shatner in The Outer Limits when my mom was watching a marathon one time. Star Trek was good, clean fun and I have been kind of sad that I didn't feel free to share the new versions with my son because I felt they were too scary for him. But we've been having an absolute blast with our own Star Trek marathon. This has been a good addition to our summer fun.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It is a new take on the space opera.  Vaughan takes all the traditional concepts and twists them just enough to create something new and wonderful.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|The movie is great, and everything's genuinely better on Blu Ray. There aren't much extra features, but at least they manage to entertain for an extra few hours to justify the Blu Ray purchase.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I was surprised a couple of days ago to find a new version of the weather app. The new version fancier than the previous one, which worked beautifully. I check the weather many times a day, and have had no problems. I am not used to the new one yet, but think I have just about got it figured out. It seems to work just as good as the original one but as I said looks prettier. It also installed on my older kindle, the smaller one, and works well on that one also. My Kindle is used mainly as a reader, but I check the weather and e mails several times a day. I also have a battery problem. I have to recharge every day, even though it is only &quot;on&quot; about three or four hours a day. That is my only complaint about the kindle, and is a problem with both the Fire 8.9 an my original smaller Kindle. It is a minor problem though since it recharges quickly, and I usually plug it in at night.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game. The puzzles require brainwork, but were not impossible. I can't wait for more puzzles to become available. Definitely worth the time.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I got copies of the movie for my son and myself, because we have the movie in VHS, but aren't able to play it because our player does not work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this book when it was new, and I was a late teen.<br />I re-read it again, and it was very entertaining from a completely different perspective. A father of two sons, both late teens, the book was excellent from a different perspective now.<br />Well written, excellent book.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This is a very easy program to maneuver.  I am still exploring all it can do. It has been fun using.

B00DU74U74|5.0|Ok, I know some people hate this girl/boys triangle in Twilight and they will hate it here. But this is a really good movie that has some originality over the typical movie in this genre. Acting done well, plot done well, set done well. It is just an overall good movie even though this genre is just not my favorite.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game ever truly a good game good for kids and the family its fun its cute you gotta love it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Really good best game so far with the wonderful different games within the game. It is worth bying it as a game
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Amazing, first of all, something that called my attention is the envelope with some stuff of enter the dragon.<br />The bonus clips are amazing.<br />I just Love it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't usually play puzzle type games, but this one was really interesting. I wish it had been longer, but can't wait for the next one. I like how there were clues but weren't always so obvious about the answer so you still had to figure most of them out. Great game to play.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Everyone I know who hasn't read it refers to the action of reading it as &#34;reading porn&#34;. There are some parts like that but I didn't find it too over the top. If you liked the Twilight Saga, this is actually a fan-fiction based on that. There aren't any werewolves and vampires, but the characters are basically the same.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained truly shocked me.  I was expecting some overdone homage to the original, but was pleasantly surprised by the well acted slavery/revenge plot line.  Samuel Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio provided such depth to their characters, that subtle interactions between both spoke volumes.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B000I9YX06|5.0|I really like this movie. I needed to use some of the stills for a school assignment on emotion vs. intelligence.
B009MO5960|4.0|Once again leave your brain at the door, and jump on this ridiculous magic carpet ride.  Another installment of zombies, bullets and babes courtesy of the Umbrella Corporation!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I was so excited to play this game... I got through the first part of it..... then when it was downloading it just glitched out and I had to restart my kindle:( so dissapointed
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I watched this just to zone out for awhile on a rainy night and for that it did well.  Special effects are good but the story and acting left a bit to be desired.  Really not much more for me to say, other could write chapters I am sure.  If you don't have high expectations and are looking for a simple evening entertainment you will probably enjoy this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read these books as soon as possible. Hugh Howey has proven the power of self publishing. His books, though rooted in post-apocalyptic science fiction, touch on so many other topics. You will be taken on a journey that you won't want to come back from after reading them.
B000BZISTE|5.0|Director Robert Altman and writer Ring Lardner produced this film about the Korean conflict. Lardner and<br />Altman, together, comprised a powerful collaboration, the product of which endures to this day. All of the actors<br />were very well suited to their roles as sinner/saints, giving the best of care to the wounded while having good<br />fun along the way. Duvall is memorable as Frank Burns, the incompetent, hypocritical head surgeon. Kellerman<br />does a standup job as Hotlips, caring and nauseatingly military. Sutherland, Gould, and Skerritt are well-cast<br />as surgeons attempting to repair the traumae of war. Everybody just wants to get the job done and go back<br />home. Betting on whether Hotlips is a natural blonde, repairing the senator's son in Japan, and helping John Schuck<br />overcome his latent homosexuality are hysterically funny incidents! Lardner and Altman excelled in this production.<br />Check it out........stir up a batch of dry martinis beforehand..... don't forget the olives.

B0045HCJT4|3.0|Forever one of my film heroes, Russell does a fine job as an outdated, but decorated, combat veteran. After failing<br />to defeat Lee in an exhibition hand-to-hand combat, Russell is cast off to a dumping-ground planet, like so much<br />other refuse and items which have outlived their usefullness. Out of place in an environment which has little need of<br />his considerable experience and talents, he seems destined to die a lonely and inglorious death among the waste<br />of humanity. When he saves a young boy from being bitten by a poisonous viper, and instructs the boy as to how to<br />dispatch the threat, he is misunderstood by the &#34;colonists&#34;. His redemption/revenge and acceptance by the colonists<br />finally shows appreciation for his specialized abilities and potential usefullness in this new life. Lee is excellent as his<br />genetically engineered nemesis. Watch it while you are cleaning your firearms..............hoorah.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it.. I can read anywhere anytime bc I always have my phone with me. Might just be my favorite app on my phone.
B002PHVAQY|5.0|Great sounds with adjusting Dials for manipulating the sounds. Convenient to use.<br />Amazon has a minimum amount of words, so I am filling balance with this.
B000HF0J36|4.0|Essentially &#34;The Thing&#34; with fins and big teeth. Quick-paced though mostly predictable, sharp acting and smart direction. A riff on &#34;Jaws&#34; that works quite well. Well above average.
B002UWH8P6|3.0|Good when it started but fading as writers imagination declines.  I liked the concept of an Ancient race traveling among the stars, but having the same tyrant and only bad aliens reflects too much of a contrast to the hopes of humanity beyond the Earth.  Season 2 is only worse.  I'm glad it ended.
B003B02O0A|5.0|A book of great heart and compassion.It was exciting and realistic of the feelings that still exist in the south today.

B00CATSONE|3.0|Nikola Tesla was one of the great minds of the 20th century.  So many things today stem from his creation.  Who knows what life would be like today if the powers that be had followed Tesla and not greed.<br /><br />This book, like so many others, falls short of giving us the complete story of Tesla.  Numerous other volumes provide the same information because many parts of Tesla's life and works have been erased by the same powers that ruined him.<br /><br />I hope someday, someone unearths new facts about what the world lost when we lost Tesla.
B000YMDQQ4|4.0|Fun and easy, as you can read one short story at a time. I gave it four stars because some of the stories were odd, but still fun and interesting. This was my first book by him and I will definitely read another.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I ordered this but it never came through so I just let it go, my bad. Maybe my smart tv
B006INDMEE|4.0|Facinating story. Hellen Mirran delivers another flaless performance. A reminder that some wounds never heal. The young Helen Mirren character was excellent.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|My only complaint is the bass. Could be a little deeper. That said, the sound is still good and they are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|This is a throw back to the old school kung fu movies that a lot of us grew up on.  It won't get an academy award but it's still a really fun movie. I've already watched it three times.
1476734941|4.0|I bought the book. I followed the directions.  I lost weight.  It was easy. It was fast.  Better than any other diet regime I ever tried. Buy the book and try it.  You will like it.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Great acting, fun story with plenty of romance for women and plenty of action for the men. The team works well together and the end credit cameos were fantastic.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I rent a VCD to watch this movie a few days ago...disappointed, not as funny as others said. There is only one part to me is funny. Instead of funny, more and more is boring, even make me loss my last patience, and then, luckily, it is the end.<br /><br />However, it is not a really bad movie, it has many good and new ideas in zombie movie actually. E.g. eat human's brain could get their memories, and when R eat the last piece, he saw he was eaten by himself, I like these imaginations. Also, there are humors, `R' and `Julie', where are their names from? Clear, right?<br /><br />Finally, if its rhythm is faster, story is more make sense, I will love it more.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Just another great hit in his cache. How does he do it each and every time. I have read just about everything he has written and I have enjoyed them all.

B00479SVBU|3.0|We've had this product for 1 year now and it just broke. The neck completely crumbled. I'm guessing from pulling it out and putting it into the outlet. It worked really well up until then. Will have to buy a new one to replace it as it is just one week over the year warranty.
B00005O3VC|5.0|My husband introduced me to this comedic film that is \\"Monty Python And The Holy Grail.\\" He has owned this dvd for over ten years now and was able to explain some of the scenes to me while allowing me to discover what happens. There are 28 scenes available in this collection and one of my favorite scenes was the humorous part where one of the knights ends up in a castle of several women that apparently want to \\"take care of him in their own way.\\" \\"Monty Python And The Holy Grail\\" is great to watch for those moments when you're craving something to make you laugh.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Use it as a remote control for my computer, or to run crew missions in SWTOR when im AFK. Good buy.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Typical &#34;guy&#34; movie, very funny. Uecker was absolutely terrific. They shouldn't have tried for any sequel. This, along with Caddy Shack and most any Vacation movie could be considered a complete &#34;evening in&#34; for any guy.
B000FCK65W|5.0|While the story is dated, it's not out of date. It's a pleasure to read and for those of us that like to step back every once and a while, it's a must read.
1451688091|5.0|This is a fascinating, well researched book, a page turner despite knowing the outcome. You experience the events leading first to the election, and later the war.  I had no idea that Lincoln was a wily politician with a loyal team supporting him, and that he had a knack of disarming his rivals and getting his way.
B000FC146C|5.0|It's easy to see why this is a modern day classic. The writing is engaging and the storytelling is precise. You care about the characters and they tell the story, thats what classics do.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is a believable television drama that makes you stop and question your own ethics and how you would react in various situations.  Of course, many of those situations the majority of us will never face if we are not politicians or 6-figure earners, but there could be some realistic parallels to real life.
B0091THDOM|5.0|This leather pouch looks very nice and slim, and protects your iPhone 5 very well. The magnetic tab easily pulls-out the phone when desired, and does not protrude significantly in your pocket (Note: it is a two-handed operation, however). The added bonus for this pouch is that it rounds-off the sharp corners of the iPhone, which prevent it from damaging and making holes in your back pants pocket. This is important for my expensive suit pants or favorite jeans. For the low price, this an excellent slimline and nice looking pouch!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Watched with my 11yo. She loved it. I thought it was fun and if you want a moral - it's teamwork pays off.

B00BESM14U|5.0|This book had a lot more controversial topics in it then I expected especially considering the tweens are all about  reading it. I did get it for my daughter but decided to read it as well. I would not recommend it for anyone under 15.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I only wish it was longer. . Interesting story and believable characters. I'd recommend this book.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|I bought this so I could watch it with my teen age daughter. She did not find it as amusing as I had when I was her age.

0752801546|5.0|The Last Coyote is # 4 in the \\"Harry Bosch Series\\" written in 1995 and it is a Super Grand Slam! Talking about standing the test of time! WOW. It is one of the most complete novels that I have read in a long time. You are going to get everything from mystery, suspense, conspiracy, greed, murder, drama on drugs, political greed, along with Michael Connelly's ability to draw you into the written lives of Harry Bosch and his family, friends and associates to the point that you are so hooked you must read the next one. I get excited because this series has been around for a while and there are at least 15 books in the series where I start from the beginning and not have to growl over the fact that I have to wait until the next one comes out!<br /><br />I found Michael Connelly's work on the San Antonio Public Library Loan on line starting with the Mickey Haller Series and discovered that the Harry Bosch series is connected and I am hooked. I had to start from the beginning on the Harry Bosch Series so I could understand \\"the beginning\\". Harry Bosch becomes a person that you know and believe. You recognize who he is and why he makes the decisions that he makes leading him deeper into the abyss of mystery.Great job Micheal!<br /><br />Hieronyous \\"Harry\\" Bosch has a very complicated character starting with his dysfunctional childhood loosing his Mother at a young age and then being thrown into a children's home and finding out later that his Mother was a prostitute which confuses him because he remembers her sweet spirit and love for him. He is forced to grow up fast and enlists in the army at 17 years old during the Vietnam conflict which starts his career into law enforcement. Her murder was never solved.<br /><br />Harry is a successful homicide detective with a reputation of rubbing everyone the wrong way.  He is in trouble again after having a physical confrontation with his supervisor and is put on mandated leave being forced to see the precinct shrink. Harry of course is his typical resisting self and gives her trouble from the beginning. Along with this drama the recent earthquake has left his house \\"condemned\\" and set for demolition. Harry is fighting all the way by hiring a lawyer to stop the demolition and in true Harry form he is illegally living in the house and repairing it himself. Somehow Harry made another ridiculous choice and did not have homeowners insurance. AAarrrggghhhh! I found myself wanting to lecture him myself. LOL.<br /><br />While on his leave he decides to solve the murder of his Mother and everything starts to spin, twist, turn, upside down then right side up and you will find yourself on a roller coaster ride ~ ~ so hang on ~ ~the ending will give you a surprise that you did not see coming !!<br /><br />ENJOY!se is his typical resisting self and gives her trouble from the beginning.

B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Look, if you are going to steal from Blade Runner, Matrix, Total Recal, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984, then you are going to have a really cool movie. So they stole literary elements form some of the best sci-fi writers of all time, so what? I do not think there are enough movies like this to go around.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is great and really allows a person to use their free time. It is interesting and competing keeps the players playing.. it looks detailed and the dinosaurs look real. So yes this is  a truely great app that i will give 5 stars
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Still a really good read, well written, complex characters & paints a detailed picture of life in this time & place. Found the storyline a bit hard to follow at times as it jumps from one story & character to another, sometimes without warning. Preferred & loved 'the kite runner'.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice room escape game. Challenging, but not ridiculously so. Can't wait for more levels! Hope they are coming soon :)
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the old version of this app and used it daily.  This latest version is horrible.  Hard to see, not user friendly and as of today won't even load on my Kindle Fire anymore.  I will be deleting this app.  What a shame they had to ruin such a good app.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We loved this!  The minions have become our favorite!  We already saw the 2nd movie and loved it a lot too!
0307744434|3.0|I like this book, but didn't love it. I was interested in, but not invested in, or empathetic to, the characters. For my taste, there was too much flowery description and not enough plot movement. The concept was pretty creative, and I do like other tales of magic. I wished though, that the author would have explained a bit more about the way that magic works in her world, and what motivated the contest in the first place. There were vague references but nothing concrete. What WAS concrete was exactly the way the food the circus sold smelled and tasted, exactly how the clothes they were wearing looked, etc. etc. I did like the love story aspect, and the way the novel concluded, but just wished there was a little more development to the story itself.
B008220D5K|1.0|A pathetically stupid film attempting to show \\"reality\\" of married life. Not one character worth interest. Poorly acted by the entire cast, with exception of John Lithgow. Exceptionally poor performance by Megan Fox and Charlyne Yi. Fox's looks do not make up for her inability to act and Yi does not belong in front of the camera. While the plot is simple enough to follow and is plausible, the acting is so dismal and the \\"humor\\" is so flat, this movie is nothing more then a waste of two hours of your life.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The best yet.  A fast smart read with all the expected twists and turns.  Can't wait for the movie.  I was a little let down by the change of coarse with the last shot in the dark but this was a great recovery.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|action, comedy and special effects, all great.  I enjoyed and would recommend.  I'm hooked on the franchise and look forward the next installment.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|I'm sure there are many people here old enough to remember this film when it came out in 1973.  Three friends and I went to see it, and I was one of the people you heard about on the news who came running out of the theater screaming bloody murder from sheer terror. I've never had a fright like that in my entire life. Even though I was Catholic, I didn't know anything about exorcisms.  And this extended edition of the film had a few more scary scenes, one was really bad.  Fortunately, I knew the best way not to fear the film, other than my faith, was to watch it periodically.  It worked, even in renting this version of it. I know it seems the best thing to do would be just not to ever watch it again.  Even in the theater, when I'd apparently had enough and let out this really big scream, I still sat there with just one eye open, and my finger in one ear; I wanted my money's worth.  I never thought I would actually buy it, but apparently the price must have been really right.  I'm not pleased at the cover picture, but no fears. I still will not watch it after dark, though.  Now 40 years later, I look at the special effects, comparing them to modern film capabilities.  The \\"head-turning\\" scene seems a bit dated; I think now it could probably be a little smoother.  But everything else remains the same, although now I'm a bit more cognizant of the medical tests Regan had to submit to having.  I don't even remember them from the theater version, but they were there. Lots of exorcism movies have been made since then and I've watched them, but not one comes close to this one.  It's very good, but very scary.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is probably the coolest escape and puzzle game I have ever played. I am 9 years old and it was challenging but not too difficult for me to do alone. I cannot wait to get the second version of it soon!
B0000683DH|5.0|This was the only one of the Star Trek films with William Shatner that I didn't have. I'm not quite sure how that happened, but here it was, and the &#34;director's cut&#34;, too.  I got it and think it's the best of the first bunch.  After all, I remember sitting in the theater crying my eyes out as Spock died.  As excellent as ever.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This is a pretty good game for kids and adults. Great short wait time waster. Easy to learn and play. Beautiful graphics.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My grandson is 20 months old.  He absolutely loves putting these puzzles together and gets super excited to be able to pop the balloons in celebration of his success.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|best band in the world!!!!Just if you wondered if they can do better,well they can..metal,rock,blusey based mixed up and great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game u can do so much things.  it is the best game I have ever played . u should get rlthe game
B000002OVJ|3.0|This is not the live CD I was hoping for from the Who, but it is non-mainstream Who renditions of blues songs they liked from what I can remember.  What I was looking for was the wild and crazy intense Who live with songs I knew pretty well.  I found the wild and crazy intense Who live music on a Blu-ray DVD by the Who called \\"Live from Kilmore\\".  I probably need to listen to the CD, The Who \\"Live at Leeds\\", more to get into it better because it seems to be another side of the ever versatile Who.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Looks intersting and engaging. Savint it for some time in the future when I'll have time to read non-required reading.
B000IOM0WO|5.0|This Blu-ray is filled with passionate performances and good rock from superstars U2.  Most of it is filmed in black and white for special effects, but it is none the less interesting and moving.  It goes back to the 80's right after the Joshua Tree CD and gives a glimpse of what U2 was about back then.  Bono provides a moving explanation of what Sunday Bloody Sunday is about that you may not find elsewhere if you are a U2 fan.  There is a strong deep bass track through the performances which sounds good on my subwoofer.  At a couple of points I could hear the bass amp speakers go into distortion close to blowing a speaker and also some bass feedback distortion like Jimi Hendrix, although I think this was unintentional for the song and accidentally made its way into a highly revealing master audio soundtrack.  Since it has dialog interspersed with the music, I don't listen to it as much as if it were a pure live performance, but it is a good insight to U2 as a band and as individuals and it is worth it for that.
B0009P5YXO|1.0|What I originally ordered was a Tenth Doctor Sonic Screwdriver with inadvisable ink and extendable light. What I got was a flashlight and that's it. Cheap design. Incorrect product. Highly unsatisfied! I was all excited when it showed up and I gave it as a present. when the receiver opened the package I was very disappointed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey! It is like a good book that you simply can't put down. The characters, the love stories, and tribute to the strength of family show that excellent television doesn't require obscenities or devaluation of people. I can't get enough of Downton Abbey!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I found &#34;Still Alice&#34; to be a very informative book about early onstage Alzheimer's disease. A must read for those of us with loved ones battling it!
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I honestly think that these books aren't as good as the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books. It feels strange to read about Percy and Annabeth when they are on quests with other people. Sorry :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game ALOT!! I can't put my device down! This game reminds me of temple run, you just simply dodge obstacles, and when you run in to obstacles you can revive your minion! This game is great for all ages!
B000PMG16U|5.0|The sound is incredible and the graphics are amazing!  I notice things in the movie that I have never noticed before.  Spectacular!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awsome i recomend this game to you guys i love this game so much! You should get this app for yourself to play it is addictive. :)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Game seemed cute but quickly discovered it's definitely geared towards children. I deleted it. I'll try something similar at a later date.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|GET THIS APP. ITS THE BEST APP EVER by gameloft in my opinion so BUY IT NOW PLEASE FOR YOUR KIDS.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My 1st cable and charger. They seemed to be defective. I spoke to an Amazon rep that agreed. This cable works better and has helped the problem.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I would much prefer the &#34;normal&#34; on screen computer settings.  Absolutely NOT liking the tablet format. It has three columns filled with photos and so makes it very difficult to navigate.
1432794426|5.0|I just bought this book and im so excited to read it! Anything pertaing to Michael Jackson is my love and i love to read about him especially if its only good! And coming from Karen it has to be good ! She is a real sweet heart! I love her very much & is sincere on facebook! Thank you Karen! I can only imagine the ride of enjoyment Im in for here thank you love Maureen
B00APYKXFS|5.0|I like this kill the alien invaders app which is a super improved modern version of of the old PC alien invaders game that has the different and more complicated levels you can reach after shooting down each advancing horde.  This is much more sophisticated though.  The graphics and sounds are light years ahead of the old game I rembered from the early PC days. You operate your defender ship with your finger, moving forward and back and left and right while automatically firing your unlimited cannons.<br /><br />The best I can say about this app is my wife, who isn't easily impressed with anything techno because its complicated, liked this the day we were sitting in our car waiting 20 minutes for a light sauce and light cheese pepperoni pizza and I had her try it.  The waiting time flew (pun) by and she was happy.  And, you know, if she's happy.  I'm happy.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|This is a great album! Even now months after I got it I listen to it regularly whenever I need a pick me up. Nothing gets your blood pumping like some Bad Religion.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My kid loves it.  It is addicting.  But Gameloft makes it near impossible to get Gru gems.  I signed up for the Facebook linking just to get some, and now that doesn't work.  Just keeps loading.  The game needs an update bad to fix the faulty Facebook link and to make Gru gems a bit easier to get.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game for off oine play<br />love.the fact of crafting items and only needing to be online for limited things
B00A89ITZG|2.0|Disappointed in poor writing skills of the author.  The subject is more interesting than this book is able to convey.  Maybe if you live in the gym, then this will make sense to you.  On the other hand, one of the tag lines that brought me to the book was the possibility of excellent physical improvement with minimum amount of time invested ( desire to minimize time, not effort).  Sad thing is, that information is probably in the book somewhere. I could not pull it out of the cloud of poor verbiage and confusing jargon. Mr. MacKenzie needed a much better editor or a coauthor.
B006VRRGNK|5.0|AWESOME!!! AWESOME!!! AWESOME!!!<br />I was nervous at first because I didn't believe that for such a reasonable price i would get all 3 DVD's BUUUUT I sure did!!!<br />Awesome as always Amazon!!!
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|I am an avid music lover who doesn't limit himself to specific genres.  I can't actually remember how I was introduced to James Blake, could have been a You Tube Video.<br />Upon first listening of the CD, I was spellbound by the sparse instrumentation and the tonality of the music and vocals. Very different sounding as the recording captivated me with the atmospheric and eeriness of James vocals.  Normally I would not be drawn to this type of vocalization, but I became entranced with this recording.  If I did have to pick something that was similar in nature, I would say 'Dead Can Dance' (which I do love and appreciate).<br />Half way through the year, there are only 3 CDs that I have become enchanted with so far in 2013.<br />Emeli Sande's and Megan Hilty's debut CDs are stellar, and now I have a third:  Overgrown by James Blake.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the challenge of the game. Keeps me entertained. Very fun game and it really keeps my brain sharp! Although some of the clues are hard to figure out.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Was looking for an interesting easy fun read ~ Found it!!!  Like the flow, the transition into book 2. Totally recommend it.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|This is an amazing account of history we don't really know about.  Especially in California, as we often think of southern culture as one size fits all, and neglect rural southern mountain culture, which this movie showcases.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|If you suffer from claustrophobia this book is not for you, a gripping read all the way through. loved it
B002MQYOFW|3.0|While not as engrossing as the first book, it did continue the story nicely.  After reading this book, I have to finish the trilogy.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Game is a lot of fun and is pretty easy. However after I got to level 8  I had to use real money in order to upgrade my cafe. Regardless it's a fun game unless you don't want to spend the money.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|can't use it on my Kindle. What a waste of  my time it was for me to try this out!.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is by far the best weather app there is. I looked at all of them and none compare. Real time map and videos of upcoming weather. I love it.
B000WDSZ8E|4.0|You have to watch the show to understand. The seasons got better but season 1 is great. All of the actors are great but Neil Patrick Harris steals the show/series!
0937381888|5.0|Very helpful. Lots of information and pictures. Great book for anyone looking to start brewing their own beer. Good to read or just to keep to refer to when needed.
1594744475|4.0|The Pros:<br />Super cute designs like mice and angels<br />lots of pictures<br />lots of how to's<br />easy to make items<br /><br />The Cons<br />Processed cheese, hot dogs, bologna etc.<br />food coloring<br />hard to find bento making items needed unless you live in Japan
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed this game from beginning till end. It kept my mind thinking to solve each step of this puzzle.  Highly recommended, you will not regret to purchase this game, it was very difficult at time, but enjoyed till the end. Great graphics...
B00B4804KS|5.0|I could write a 10 paragraph review on all the things that are so amazing about this movie in 3D. T-rex roaring in my face, rain everywhere, edge of my seat. That sums it though. Really, buy this dvd, You will be so glad you did, It's liike seeing it for the first time.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|The scanner dose not show the picture on your computer screen.  It is hard to tell weather or not it is a good clean scan.  It also automatically lightens & darkens the slide for you, some times too much either way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic! The story line is developing nicely and the treatment of various subjects is dealt with well.  I cannot wait for more!
1609611543|4.0|I am still reading the book but so far I like the book very much, and hope it will help me as I go forward.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I have to say I love everything Eckhart Tolle.  This book is no exception.  If you know Eckhart's work, you know what I mean.  If you don't, give yourself a gift and read this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the actors, the script, the fashions, the story line. A great review of history; of the War; how the citizens coped with the rationing and making do. I am having a hard time waiting for Season 4.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|This album is so sick. Unreal sick. Listening reminds of the first time I heard Coldplay, Mumford, Fleet Foxes, what have you. I'm all about it. Makes me want to have sex and boon really hard simultaneously. Purchasing purely because I want to support this band. For sure seeing them in August at the Palladium. Fight on.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|If you need to sharpen that trusty old scout knife or can't take precision sharpening tools with you this is ok. I would not use it on anything worth more than $10 though. You will never get your knives sharp enough to shave with but you can at least get a workable edge in a pinch if needed. This tool is for someone who does not know or care to know how to actually sharpen knives. The best part is the diamond file which is quite handy for non-cutlery tooling. It's worth having in your tool kit.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|With sharp writing and superb acting by pros with years of experience (Homicide, Sports Night, early Law & Order,and Cybil to name a few &#34;oldies&#34;) this show always pleases. It's a true ensemble show. I only wish they would have made Alan Cumming's character a gay man. Might have added some interesting dimension.<br />Rose Rush
B0070YDOT8|1.0|i c keep playing this game but,I must be an idiot because it is a piece  of  Crap<br /> It keeps crashing and throwing you out in the middle of tourneys.  You are playing slots and the wheel won't stop spinnin<br />Carl.  Keeps crashing and throwing you out in the middle of tourneys
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Great music from a fantastic artist. His CD's never let me down. If you enjoy Michael Buble, you'll love this CD!
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I loved the deleted scenes and all of the behind the scenes footage. This is one of my all time favorite books and movies.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Great to see the old shows so clear and color so vibrant. The enhanced effects are done well too. highly recommend!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another hit by Hosseini.  He understands the human equation so well.  The way in which he intertwines the characters is amazing. I would recommend this to all adult readers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It could have been a bit more challenging for my taste but I did enjoy the game. I would like to see more levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and I play it all day, I love it. What you do is you run and dodge obstacles. I really recomend it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app is super convenient and easy to use. When I check my email on the web on my kindle the format is weird so this makes it much easier to check my mail.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Loved this book. In my opinion it's a lot better than Divergent and that's a lot to say, does not leave you with lots of questions at the end like Divergent. Truly recommend this book, can't wait to start read book two of the series.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|After the intro it goes to loading and locks up. Can't even quit and start over. I need to uninstall. too has because its a fun game on my iphone.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I haven't read a book so lively and entertaining in a long time! The love shared by grandfather and grandson creates an adventure into new worlds, suspense, and surprises.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This app is so fun when i want a cool picture  this app is truly one of a kind i recommend it to all ages  I got this app for the free app of the day but it is worth the 99 cents
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've played other versions of this game on the pc but this one is best.  It helps a lot if you already know the magic fundamentals.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love how its very easy to read and digest information that in other books is more dense , this is easy to read and contains universal laws that will help anyone
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|i deleted from library..dont know why i acquired it as i am not able to acquire Candy Crush Saga on my kindle fire..i am sad
B005544TRQ|5.0|Addicting and entertaining, I watched the first two seasons in one week! Highly suggest you watch from the beginning, you will be hooked after the first episode.
0689835604|2.0|I was hoping for a more pages -- more body parts.  This book only has 6 pages that cover the following:<br /><br />1) Eyes<br />2) Mouth<br />3) Belly Button<br />4) Feet<br />5) Hands<br />6) Baby (&#34;Where is baby?&#34;)<br /><br />It would have been more complete to have a book with more body parts (e.g., Ears, nose, arms, legs, toes, fingers, etc.).<br /><br />Also, the flaps are far too big.  It's easy for my daughter to grab the tabs to look under, but they're so big that she ends up bending them in her grip.  I have other &#34;lift-the-flap&#34; books that have much smaller (and thicker) tabs that allow the baby to participate without damaging the book.
B001KTATIS|4.0|Great depiction of the sexual debauchery gone run-amuck during the Roman Era. It probably has 2 of the best sex scenes ever made, but brace yourself for the extreme violent scenes. Not for the faint of heart!
B008MM9630|4.0|sooooo much fun it cuts out every once in a while but its still good. I absolutely love this game!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is a MUST READ. The whole Corssfire series keeps readers on the edge of their seats. I read Fifty Shades of Grey and of course like many other women in the world became instantly OBSESSED with Christian and Anastasia's story. I defiantely did not think that Fifty Shades could ever be topped, but I was wrong. When I first saw this book pop up in my Amazon email, I thought &#34;There's no way I am going to read this, it seems like its just a replica of Fifty shades with a different aspect.&#34; A few days later I was trying to decide on my next book to read and nothing seemed to interest me. So I thought, What the heck, I'll start to read it and if I dont like it i'll just get another book. So I started with the first book of the Crossfire series and I finished all three books within 2 weeks. I have come to be OBSESSED with Gideon and Eva's story, even more that Christian Grey and Anastasia's. When I finished the third book in this corssfire series, I couldnt believe that it just ended. I was so confused and mad that I went on Google and put in a search for the series to find out more about the author and to see if there were any plans for another book. I found that there are going to be 2 more books to this Crossfire series and I cant wait to read them. I have been checking Sylvia Day's website daily to see when the release date will be for the fourth book. The way Gideon and Eva fit so well together and his obsession and NEED for her will keep you wanting more. This Crossfire series has nothing on Fifty Shades.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I mean I like the game and all but one day I got on temple run and it made me start all over!!!!!! I had almost all the upgrades! A lot of cash and stuff unlocked. Me working for mouths trying to get all this stuff. NEVER un-stalling. This game either. I was pretty upset. Now I have to start all over. But yes I like this game A LOT actually 2 stars pony for making me have to start ALL over.
0380729407|3.0|I was happy to see Bradbury using Greentown IL as the setting for this novel.  In \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" Bradbury again uses 2 younger boys (13) to give the reader a glimpse into Greentown, but this time it involves a strange carnival.  If you loved \\"Dandelion Wine\\" and \\"Farewell Summer\\" like I did, you should know this is more of a horror sci-fi novel.  I felt there was enough to keep me interested but couldn't help feeling that there was something lacking.  At certain times I just didn't seem to get any chills or scares with the carnival or its villains other than Mr. Dark.  I kept saying to myself \\"I guess this is it.\\"  Also, if you've read negative reviews for this book, you'll notice a lot of readers are bored and/or upset with Bradbury's dialogue and explanations throughout.  I must admit some of it may have been over my head but other times it helped me connect to what Bradbury was trying to convey.  It may take me several more reads for me to really appreciate what other positive reviewers were talking about.<br /><br />As another reviewer put it, there may be a generational gap between those who can appreciate a carnival being the strange twisted scary landscape for a novel.  I believe \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" was completed in 1962 and the scary carnival concept was probably a more original concept back then.  A newer reader (myself included) has probably seen this numerous times in cartoons, video games, TV shows, and other books.<br /><br />Much like \\"Dandelion Wine\\", I thought Bradbury did a wonderful job in his portrayal of the two young boys Will and Jim.  He made me feel like I was young again with his many references to kites (have not thought of my times of flying a kite in probably 25 years), sneaking out of the house at night to meet friends (one of the bigger rushes I remember getting as a kid), and even later in the story he makes a reference of Will urging himself to whistle while he walks past the graveyard after sundown(Icould see myself doing something like that just to tell myself there was nothing to be scared of).<br /><br />Probably the most powerful part of \\"Something Wicked...\\" was when young Will's father Charles Halloway seems to come to life later in the story talking of love and common cause (page 195).  Take from it what you will, I thought it was brilliant, I just wished I could have been moved like that earlier in the story.  Again, this may take another read for me to fully appreciate what Bradbury has given to us.  Somewhat lacking in suspense for me, but spinning a little magical charm here and there.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Awesome! The is a great app for Android users. I love reading, and Amazon has a large selection of e-books for Kindle. Now, with this app, I can enjoy reading my favorite books from Amazon on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0.
B008CFN95I|5.0|Have recommended this to many people as I enjoyed it so much - would make a great movie. It is kind of sci-fi for people that don't really like sci-fi
B004UPANGM|5.0|A classic horror/comedy that never gets old, Bruce Campbell is a commanding presence in every performance and these movies are at the heart of any true zombie fan
B00821PCJS|5.0|Really recommend it if you like realistic sci-fi shows! It kind of reminds me of Terminator mixed with War of the Worlds....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game to have you thinking and being very observant to details. I love it, its great, makes me pay attention more
B008B11R1Q|5.0|Bought it months ago and it's still on my repeating playlist! Love Oliver Sim's voice.....so deep and sultry! Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Chris Isaac, Depeche Mode, or  Lana Del Rey.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|It is definitely a heartbreaking film. You have to be in the mood to watch, but it is worth it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have enjoyed the game thus far.  The levels are challenging and addictive. If you become stuck on a level there are also videos on YouTube.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.<br /><br />Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.<br /><br />At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the \\"righteous\\" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.<br /><br />Molecular visuals of METH.<br />Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, \\"the blue stuff\\", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.<br /><br />For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.<br /><br />In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. Afterhaving suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.<br /><br />At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.<br /><br />DISCUSSION:<br /><br />I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:<br /><br />Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug \\"meth\\" by amateurs in their own \\"RV super lab\\"?

B000TDGGRY|4.0|I love the Sigma Force novels.  Lot's fo fun reading them.  Lot's of action -- never slows down.  I also like the characters.  I have the Kindle edition and noticed some transcritpion errors throughout the book.  I have noticed this with pretty much ever Kindle book I have purchased -- missing words -- sentances ending and on the next page a different sentance spoken by a different character displayed half-way through the sentance.  The storey is a 5, but the errors bring it to a 4.

I was heartbroken when I heard that Geoff<br />Tate was not in the band anymore. I must say, Todd LaTorre has an awesome voice and fills Geoff Tate's shoes rather<br />nicely. I absolutely love this album, my favorite since Promised Land, that's for sure.<br />  My favorite songs are: Where dreams go to die, Spore, In this light, A World Without, Open Road..etc. You get<br />the hint..the whole album rocks!!Great job guys! Good to see you are back and that the Ryche rolls on!!

0307949486|5.0|This book is so popular that I had to read it and see if it lived up to the hype.  Guess what?  It does.  It SO does.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo is set in Sweden, which can be a little confusing at times.  All of the town names, character names, and dialogue patterns are unfamiliar to most readers.  This made the story a little difficult to follow, especially in the beginning.  The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo really takes off about 200 pages in.  And when I got to about 300 pages, I became unable to put it down.<br /><br />This is a very uniquely written book.  The writing feels heavy at times.  The best comparison I can make is to say that it reads a little like one of Ken Follett's historical fiction novels.  And by that, I mean that while slow to build up steam, the story gets really good about halfway through, and from there you just can't stop reading.<br /><br />I am no economist, nor am I plugged into the financial world.  Hey, I'm too busy reading to even watch the news!  This didn't stop me from really enjoying this book, though.  Yes, the story is about a journalist and a hacker who uncover major financial scandals and upset the Swedish Stock Exchange; however, you don't have to have a college-level grasp of economics to understand and appreciate the story.<br /><br />My favorite character is Lisbeth.  She is such a plucky little thing.  I felt sorry for her but loved how she refuses to act like a victim.  I'm looking forward to book two:  The Girl Who Played With Fire.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The back story, especially about the Vanger family history, was overwhelming at times.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />I love the poetic justice that befalls Larsson's &#34;bad guys.&#34;  The only other author I've read who can wield that kind of payback is Ken Follett.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|I expected More of a how to, rather than a . . . I don't know exactly what it actually is. Certainly not a bad book, just not a how to.
0385342055|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Having missed Becky's pregnancy and Minnie's early years, I didn't have too much trouble catching up to Minnie as a toddler.  Unsurprisingly, Minnie is truly Becky's &#34;mini-me&#34; and is a seasoned shopper at two years old.  The plot of this book centers on Minnie's shopping and stubbornness and a surprise birthday party Becky is planning for Luke.  Especially funny parts include Becky and her mom's discovery of the &#34;dollar store&#34; and Minnie's intervention with a popular nanny.  My favorite part of the book was Becky's treatment of Luke's mother and how she starts to forgive her and include her in their lives.  I really enjoyed Mini Shopaholic, but I think I would have liked it even more if I had read book five first.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Really enjoyed Rango. I loved the use of other films such as China town and High noon to name only two. Lots of subtle humor.
0440241901|4.0|I found this book on the Nook deals page and loved the sound of it.  I've read Sophie Kinsella before---I loved Remember Me---and devoured this book in a day.  Who doesn't keep secrets?  The idea of sharing all of your secrets with a stranger, and then having that stranger be the CEO of your company, was so appalling that I knew I had to read Can You Keep a Secret? as soon as I read the summary.<br /><br />I liked Emma right from the start.  She is so believably flawed and likeable.  I loved her view on the world.  She reminded me of Bridget Jones.  I loved her accent---I could literally hear it in my head as I read the dialogue.  Emma's relationship with Jack was so much fun to read about.  The slow build of their mutual attraction was very well done and I was rooting for them to make it as a couple.<br /><br />The ending was a little predictable, but that did not lessen my enjoyment.  I loved Can You Keep a Secret?  and plan to pick up another Sophie Kinsella book when I need a fast, light-hearted, and fun read.
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|Repetitive and boring.  I usually love G5 games but this is not one of them.  It is a good game, just not for me.  Plays fine on my galaxy tablet.
0307454568|4.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />I loved The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo so much and was disappointed that The Girl Who Played With Fire was not as compelling.  I had high hopes that the final installment in the series would make up for the deficits of book two.  While The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was definitely better than The Girl Who Played With Fire, it didn't reach the same level of excellence that The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo did for me.<br /><br />I can appreciate that the people of Sweden were totally floored by this series.  The books go into politics, history, police corruption, international terror, crime, and pull events in Sweden's history into the plot that makes you believe the stories are true.  I can see how Sweden went crazy for Stieg Larsson.  But that emphasis on Sweden and the political slant of this series is what made it hard to get through for me.  I had a hard time putting the events of the The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest into perspective, especially when Larsson references events in Sweden's history that I have no concept of.  He includes an appendix but I found flipping back and forth to be really tedious.<br /><br />There were times when I wanted to give up on this book, and almost did except for the fact that I've spent so much time on this series and I had to know how it would end.  The events of the last 100 pages saved the book for me.  The way Larsson wraps up the story, pulling all of the dozens of characters' stories together for a thrilling conclusion, is rivaled only by Ken Follett, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to fans of crime fiction.  People wanting a love story or a light summer read will be wholly disappointed.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The book is pretty dry at times.  Sometimes we would go for 100 pages without anything of note happening. Stieg Larsson doesn't just tell you that a character goes into brain surgery, he tells you exactly what the surgeon does in great detail during the surgery.  This is why his books are so long.  I thought I was never going to get through some parts!<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The ending, the poetic justice, the character growth were all great.rgery.  This is why his books are so long.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got the app for my kiddo &amp; find that I really like it too!  It's beautiful and relaxing and fun. I like it every bit as much as he does. I recommend it.
0440244870|4.0|I have recently discovered Sophie Kinsella, and along with it, the realization that I like chick lit.  I like it a lot, actually.  I never thought it would be for me: I thought it was too superficial, too light, lacking in depth and substance.  But it's not.  Chick lit is perfect for when I need a fast, fun, read.  It's perfect for when I'm not feeling up to reading a book that makes me think too much.<br /><br />I always shied away from the Shopaholic series because I thought it was &#34;beneath me,&#34; so to speak (see the above reasons why I have not read chick lit in the past).  After reading and loving Sophie Kinsella's Remember Me and Can You Keep a Secret? I decided to start the Shopaholic series.<br /><br />I love shopping, so I really identified with Becky.  I have never shopped to the point to where I am in debt, but I can totally understand how easy it would be to get to that point.  I have Mr. I'd So Rather Be Reading to keep me in line there.  Anyway, Becky is in debt but can't stop shopping.  She is, of all things, a financial journalist, but is not interested or invested in her job.  She basically just wants to wear pretty clothes and have a good time.  She decides she has to start either cutting back or making more money to get out of debt.  Cutting back is an epic fail, and making more money is not going well either.  Until things start to change.<br /><br />What I loved about this book was Becky's quirky personality.  She continually surprised me.  Just when I thought she was hopeless, she started to grow and change.  The best thing about the book, though, was the humor.  Oh, my gosh, it was so funny!  I kept laughing out loud while reading, over and over again.  I love when a book makes me laugh!<br />I thoroughly enjoyed Confessions of a Shopaholic and will definitely be back for more.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|great price nice to have them all in one love it!!!  I would recommend getting if you enjoy the shows.
0307949508|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />I thought The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo was great, so I was fully expecting a stellar sequel.  While The Girl Who Played With Fire was still a very good book, it felt flat to me.  The middle dragged on forever, with long explanations about police investigations both past and present.  The reader follows at least 12 investigators, plus many of the same characters from the first book.  This was confusing at times and slowed down the pace for me.<br /><br />The ending saved the book, and set up The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest perfectly.  In retrospect, I think The Girl Who Played With Fire was setting up book three, since not much was resolved by the end of the book.  This one felt like a world-building novel, still good, but not as thrilling as the first one.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />There were just too many characters to follow!<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />I just love reading about Lisbeth.  She is brilliant, plucky, and a survivor.  I love that she hates her feelings toward Blomkvist.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Interesting,a little slow in the middle of the book ,quite surprising  and comical towards the end! I would read another book by this author!
0452289963|5.0|I really believe that all of humanity should read this book. It will change the way you look at things. My first favorite, is the Power of Now.
B00BBW14YC|5.0|This is a true story.  It is a warm and funny movie.  You will not regret spending time to watch it.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This Star Trek Series is still our favorite one! This particular set has a wonderful feature in that you can watch it as it was shown &#34;back in the day&#34; or you can choose to watch it with enhanced effects. The planets have more detail as does the Enterprise, some of the backgrounds are spruced up a bit etc. This is the clearest I've ever seen the original series ~ better than the first time we saw it &#34;back in the day&#34;!
B0060D49VW|5.0|Amazing! Channing Tatum!!  I love him! So amazing I like the part were they make the group and she's like what accent I have no accent
B003L77GG0|5.0|Loved the whole series, but they tried to wrap the end up in too short of a time, leaving some things unexplained.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love it for the most part...having some freezing issues when special locations or items are used. Not sure if it's my tablet or the game' but all in all I very much enjoy the game.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|One of my all time faves, I really hope it stays around with all its cast members for many more years.  They have quite a chemistry together that comes from working together over a period of time.  Super show.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Don't read any spoilers on this because the plot twists are the main thing it has going for it.  It reminds me of 80's Michael Douglas movies but with more than just one surprise.  You won't know who to sympathize with and who to condemn until near the end.  So many new pills are rushed out into the market and prescribed to the wrong people that, in retrospect, you could believe something this crazy might happen.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Definitely not a show for chase fans, but rather fans who like to think.  This is a really good thought provoking show.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This film does not spoon feed any easy conclusions about human struggles.  Having each actor play multiple roles is not about reincarnation but rather how much we are a product of environment.  Yes it's a very long 3 hours.  Watch half and then sleep on it.  My favorite novel is \\"Point Counterpoint\\" so I enjoy a \\"God like\\" perspective of peripherally connected characters forced to examine their lives.  Of course some will interest you more than others.  Despite the occasionally awkward script, Jim Broadbent and the cinematographers deserved oscars.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|it is scarry vilont and a stupid it is a shark eating people I teal like s***  it is like. poop
B003O86FMW|5.0|IT WAS VERY INTRIGUING AND HAD SUSPENSE. A DEFINITE FIVE STAR RATING FOR SUZANNE COLLINS, THE WRITING MAESTRII. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
B007B8EX9I|1.0|I am very frustrated with this instant streaming. It worked for me about a week ago and now it won't load. I know it is not my internet and it seems like other people are having problems. This is very frustrating. I wouldn't really use this service again nor would I bother with Amazon Prime (Student or regular Prime) again....its a waste of your time and money!!! Not worth it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|A classic old Hollywood romance with stellar, memorable performances from each member of the cast. Every time I watch this movie I'm always surprised with how many lines are routinely quoted in everyday conversations. Just further testament to it's relevance, regardless of the time that passes.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I like the fact that this app works even when I have no WiFi connection. Having this app helps me plan what I'm going to wear based on the type of weather of the day.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|It wasn't even &#34;so bad it's good,&#34; it was just terrible.  Probably not the actors' fault - the dialogue was flat and the plot made zero sense. Sadly, no way to get my $5 rental fee back but at least I got some laundry and other chores done while it was playing.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book my teacher recommend it and u fell in love with it kinda has some myster and surprises.so go on and read this book
B008Y78M60|4.0|Overall a good movie.  Well acted and interesting historical piece about the Lincoln assassins, particularly Mary Surratt.  Recommended to those interested in history.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The hearts are what ruin this game for me. Hearts are used to buy certain ponies. you can only get hearts through social networks
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I watched the movie, and the visuals are nice, but the movie is drawn out much too long. You also have to suspend disbelief, because a lot of plot points are very thin. The \\"Wizard\\" is a bastard, who the movie makes out to be a redeemed hero. Well, what about how quickly he turned against Theodora? I actually feel quite sorry, and it's amazing how no one tries to rescue Theodora from the curse. Once Theodora turns evil, that's it, she must be destroyed? What? No, \\"oh she was really nice, there must be something nice still left\\", just instant, unquestioning, \\"now she is the enemy\\" crap? A crappy film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins has done it again! Great continuation of the 1st Hunger Games. What a great spin on the Quell! Who knew the story would go in this direction?!?!? Don't want to give anything away, but you must read this if yo I read the first book! Amazing. Now onto the next for sure!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Is this season Spanish dubbed? It only says it has Spanish subtitles but when I look it up somewhere else like Bestbuy.com it says it is Spanish dubbed. I am a little confused and it would be nice if someone could help. My dad loves this show and so do I, but he doesnt understand English very well so we watch it in Spanish. The first season was great and Im sure this one will be just as good.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Dudes this game is freaking awesome. Best first person shooting game ever. The video makes it look bad but when u really play it the graffits are great. YOU get to play with three people. BLAKE, ANDERSON, AND PAGE. it is just great but campaign needs to be longer because only 12 stages.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie before reading the book.  The book definitely put the movie to shame.  The story was captivating! I felt myself enter the games.  Wish it had gone into more detail about the history of the individual district's so it would have been easier to relate to the other characters.  Overall it is an awesome book.  Cannot wait for the second book.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is fun and if u love mario which I do u will become addicted to this game I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves mario It is a very challenging and entertaining game I hope this helps:):D
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Its volbeat, if you like them you love this CD.  Something a little different than the normal.  I like it
0307455874|3.0|I gained a lot of information about the author.<br /><br />He is a very articulate writer and a knowledgeable individual and human being.
B000O178BY|3.0|Reminds me a little bit of older nine inch nails, the drugs I did as a kid would have helped this disc
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story in this novel spans over a lifetime, revolves around a few central characters and the many others whose lives somehow are touched by the events in these central characters' lives. The different parent-child relationships and the descriptions of love related to these is thought-provoking. A page turner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game ever, i play it when i have the chance cant wait till next update!!!! But you seriously need to update faster!!!!!! :) :)
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This whole series is fantastic!  Great characters and plot lines!  Start with the first book in the series and keep going.  Each book answers more questions and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Loved them all!
0451418441|5.0|Monumental in size, in scope and execution, World Without End is an enthralling read that deserves all the superlatives it has gleaned. I'm only sorry it took me so long to get around to read it - it's been sitting on my library shelf for five years. Initially, I was daunted by its size. But once I'd read Pillars, I knew that it might be a thick book, but it would be a fast read, and it was, as Follett's story pulls you in and the pages seem to turn of their own volition.<br /><br />It spans the period 1327 to 1361, following the lives of four main characters, Gwenda, Caris, and the two brothers Merthin and Ralph. The saga begins with these four as children, witnessing a fight and a murder in the forest - an event that has far-reaching consequences. After 60 pages or so, we leap forward ten years and their separate lives begin to go in different directions. Both of Follett's main female characters are strong, gutsy - Caris is a splendid creation, heroic, brave, driven, saintly yet flawed. The two brothers are complete opposites, Merthin a pacifist and a builder, while Ralph a violent and a destructive seeker of power. Intertwined with these four are many other characters, rich and poor, simple and complex, cunning and humorous. The plotting is faultless, evidence of a master storyteller at his peak.<br /><br />Throughout, it's a believable depiction of the lives and times in this period, with the feudal system crushing ambition, the plague devastating swathes of the population, and politics of church and aristocracy vying for power and glory. By the end, I felt I'd lived with these characters and was sorry to leave (most) of them - no mean achievement for a writer after so many pages!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The story and characters are pretty original and I loved them. However, I felt that the book was poorly put together. The writing style seemed choppy, the author contradicted herself several times, and the book felt underdeveloped overall.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Maybe for the forth book in the &#34;trilogy&#34; we will only have to pay half price since I paid full price for this one and got less than half a story.  This really is despicable and I know the author is capable of so much more because the first two books delivered.
B004YM6JLO|4.0|My daughter loves this show and collects so she can watch over and over. Thankyou for offering a great price.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I was very happy with the previous version, but the latest update (with all the achievements and video game junk) is very buggy.  About 75% of the time, it will lock up my Kindle Fire, forcing me into a hard reboot to recover the use of my device. The new interface is not very intuitive, either - at least not on the Kindle version.  Boo bad...
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie was good; however, I read the book prior to this and really wanted to see more of the book involved. All in all, I will put this movie on my shelf to watch on a rainy day.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|If given a longer play time, they could have really transformed this movie into something big. But I will say it was a great movie to watch that you do not have to think about, and has a nice amount of action in it.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It was quite fun to play and I would recommend it to keep your kids entertained while on a trip.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game on par with some other hack n slash games. The in game purchases seem to be fair and mainly cosmetic or for people who for some odd reason want to pay for things they can unlock by playing a game they plan to play anyway.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Awesome sci-fi comedy, a B rated movie at best, but it is a great comedy and should become a pop culture classic
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|a bit creepy, a lot fantastic.<br />I really enjoyed jumping back into childhood and how anything is possible.<br />I found the Hempstocks a very interesting family
B006UUK612|5.0|This is a cute and fun movie to watch with the whole family. I'm thinking to buy it so we can watch it anytime.
B007SPPANM|5.0|This is an awesome movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all times. I can watch it over and over again.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love the Phantom of the Opera movie. It is very good comparing it to the Broadway show that I loved!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun to be a minion. Despicable Me 2 is GREAT. CANT WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN, OVER AND OVER. (:
B007I0J4O8|5.0|This is a must read for my team. I picked this up in an airport years ago and it has become my all time favorite.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Connection to kindle device had to be manually maintained in order to complete charge. New charger seems to have a larger plug.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|Bill Evans is the classic pianist of his era, maybe of all eras.  He nails it in this CD with very understandable arrangements of classics and also new tunes that will become familiar on only a few listenings.  Really a must buy if you want to have a complete Evans' collection.
B00000IL29|5.0|Herbie Hancock ushered in a whole new type of jazz, along with Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck and others.  This CD previews what Miles later did and contains classics that will be very familiar to listeners.  He is still a leader of jazz pianists/musicians, now in his mid-70's.  Herbie still packs in crowds for live performances around the US.  Listen to this CD for an early preview of why he is still popular!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's fun and awesome bit I think they copy subway surf just a lil bit<br />I love it still game is fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've seen the movie and now I've read the book. I loved the book and the series. Can't wait to read the other two and to watch the movies when they come out. Couldn't put the book down.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Very intense. Fun to see different incarnations of major character. Mix ups and mysteries about various characters motivations.  Much is hinted at and much is hidden.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|I'll be honest, I pretty much just watched this movie because Chris Evans is in it and I was working my way through his body of work.  But I really enjoyed this one.  There are a few cheesy moments with the &#34;bad guy&#34;, but overall, it's a great disaster in space movie and the tension is great.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Love this Show and it's music!! I really enjoyed watching it and very entertaining!! Cyndi Lauper did amazing job with this album!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this season!  I couldn't resist picking this up when I saw the price, and I have to say, we've more than gotten our money's worth watching it over and over again.
B00008G7UF|5.0|And I used to live in France. Kevin Kline played a Frenchman. In fact, until I saw the credits, I thought he was really French. Super chick flick.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this season!  I couldn't resist picking this up when I saw the price, and I have to say, we've more than gotten our money's worth watching it over and over again.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|The series was hitting its stride in the third season. Great stories and whether you like Star Trek or not, the stories are compelling and plain old fun.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this season!  I couldn't resist picking this up when I saw the price, and I have to say, we've more than gotten our money's worth watching it over and over again.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I enjoyed Kyle's book immensely and recommend it to anyone who wants to understand what our brave troops saw and experienced. A fascinating book.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie isn't for the squeamish, but if you're watching Dredd, chances are you know what you're in for and this movie doesn't disappoint.  Sooo much better than the Stallone farce!
B005HEPN06|5.0|Smart writing, great character development and wit. One of the best series ever.Whether you are a Star Trek fan or not, I highly recommend it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is my favorite season!  I couldn't resist picking this up when I saw the price, and I have to say, we've more than gotten our money's worth watching it over and over again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't know when I've read a book with so many plot twists. I thought I knew \\"whodunit\\" early on, then decided it was all red herrings. Turns out I didn't even know \\"what\\", much less \\"who\\".<br /><br />One complaint: The excessive (in my opinion) foul language that begins in the middle of the book.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I read some less than glowing reviews of this movie from critics, so my expectations weren't all that great.  To be honest, I went because I like both the main leads and expected it to kinda suck.  Instead, I was genuinely entertained.  They went over the top with it, but that's part of the charm.  I couldn't wait for it to be available in Blu Ray and Amazon had a fantastic price.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Love Keshas rawness..the Girls my Hero! She has the best lyrics and catchy tunes. My absolute fav song is Crazu Kids .next Cmon...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm interested in life after death and saw this book at the bookstore.  I immediately purchased it on Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|fun  a little hard to control at times but very addictive.  you have to be sure to always . . . got to go and start another game
B00AQO1VYY|4.0|The videos are grainy but decent enough quality for archiving purposes.  The live performances are hit/miss, some songs really translated well live while songs like November Hotel are sloppy.<br /><br />On the other hand, the CD sounds terrific and since I haven't had a copy of this on disc for many years it was nice to have a final high quality version.  I can't say I hear a tremendous improvement over the original in terms of fidelity gains, but it does sound good (considering it was recorded 'live' in the studio).  Bonus tracks aren't bad and it's nice to have everything they ever recorded.  RIP Layne, the music world misses you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great game it is not take a long time to load I am addicted to this game get it
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I love the heck out of this album, but I have to be objective and realistic with my review.  As a Soundgarden fan since Badmotorfinger, I'm a bit biased toward their style of rock.  This album brings up back to the time pre-Superunknown, while injecting some of their newer feel experiemented with on Down/Upside.  Some songs go on for longer than they have to, some are too light, and some just not colorful enough to hold my interest.  But most of them are solid rockers and the few slower songs deliver meaningful messages without feeling contrived.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games 2 is absolutely brilliant in my opinion I couldnt stop reading it . I was curious what was going to happen in some chapters. The character who played the president was also  very good forcing Katniss to fall in love with  Peeta. A decision left to Katniss and if she refuses she could endanger the ones she loves the most.
B005974CNA|3.0|I've been a fan since Images and Words.  While I won't say I'm a Mike Portnoy fanboy, I do think his influence on the band is a key element missing from these recordings.  The performances are as solid as ever.  James' vocals are as strong as I've heard in years.  There's just something missing, an attitude or punctuation absent that would make these less prog cheese and more heavy creamy goodness.  After forcing myself to listen to this album 10 or 20 times I had to give up and move on to other music.  Systematic Chaos, Awake, Scenes all still get regular listens.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a book unlike any other that I've read and am very glad that I read it because it is an amazing story set during World War II
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Josh is on a tear.  Them Crooked Vultures and now this.  Easily the best music to appear on one QOTSA record.  It jumps through every music hoop with ease, grace, and intensity.  Has light hearted songs (&#34;Smooth Sailing&#34;), punch-you-in-the-gut headier material (&#34;My God Is the Sun&#34;, &#34;I Appear Missing&#34;), and stuff that just doesn't fit easily into any R&R mold (&#34;Kalopsia&#34;).  This might be the most progressive sounding album for a band that's always been straddling the line of what's rock, prog, and &#34;stoner rock&#34; (WTTH that means!).  This has been playing almost non-stop in my car since release and there's no signs of fatigue.  It seems I'm always finding nuances and new favorites.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Had to read on after 1 & 2. Looking forward to 4 & 5 and ,it seems , 6 & 7 as well
B004LK5CEE|5.0|I always thought the lead charatcter (Russell) was a shallow ^@$%, but after seeing the deleted scenes I get what they were actually striving for.  It's a shame those scenes had to be removed to fit into the narrow attention span gap of pop culture.  Easy Oscar contender with those scenes, understandably not without.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|For sheer drama it was hard to surpass the Larsson trilogy and in particular, the &#34; Hornet's Nest&#34;. What a shame he is no longer with us but he left a lasting legacy.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I would give this more stars if there were more standout tracks.  As-is, I'm currently only itching to play the album to hear maybe 4 or 5 songs.  The rest I feel I could skip and not miss.  But even within the stinkers, there's moments of genius.<br /><br />Focusing on the stronger songs, like the single &#34;Stone&#34;, we see a band in full stride writing original licks and mashing rock before your ears.  The title track is a tongue-in-cheek attempt at a heady topic and for the most part succeeds.  The real winner for me is &#34;Phantom Limb&#34; which features some of the heaviest AIC riffing ever recorded (think &#34;Dam that river&#34; intensity).<br /><br />This wouldn't be the album I would recommend to a first time AIC listener, and while it may not be an instant classic by no means is this a sign we should write them off.  I'll continue to support the band and listen to the music they make.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|The story isn't just a love story, but a great suspense thriller that keeps you wondering virtually till the end.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|Many fans don't like the artwork that plays with the Bluray, but I feel it's a nice addition to the presentation.  The mix is very good, although thin on the 5.1 magic.  Placement of the instruments felt flat at a times, like a stereo mix with 3D reverb added.  Not enough wow factor I suppose.  But the audio quality (fidelity) is top notch, not that the original was poor.  Having a high bitrate of classic albums is always a good thing!
B004UPANAI|4.0|It has some aspects that the movie could go without, but overall it is well worth seeing and learning about one of many people's favorite X-men
B0058WFO06|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />This album is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Steven Wilson.
B0042ETJU2|4.0|Much like we first were introduced to a sci-fi classic creation in Alien, so too are these 3 movies.  Each has pluses and minuses, but always entertain.
B000002GJH|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />This album is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam o Soungarden.
B001TH16DI|5.0|A wonderful compilation of all 6 original cast movies.  Beautifully done in Blu-Ray and giving new life to a set of great movies.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great packaging, and a steal at half price for an epic HBO series! Keep your eyes open for great discount items at AMAZON,
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I know of Anthony Bourdain, but very vaguely.<br /><br />This was a fascinating read, I am surprised he is alive having learn (through his words) his drug and alcohol fueled early life.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Intriguing story, good acting and effects. I could not help wondering though, if, in the future, everything will be made by Apple! Oh, and I want Will Smith's car!
B009RWRIZ2|5.0|This is an wonderfully mediative dance documentary.<br />I saw it multiple times in the cinema and was deeply moved by her work and music.<br />Not the same as a performance or the cinema<br />Yet a wonderful addition to our collection
B008LZYR0A|3.0|I'm a huge PSB fan, but found this song, originally written with Eurovision as a possibility to be so unlike their usual product, that I just couldn't get into it. Even on the album, it sort of sits there and feels way out of place. Obviously released to coincide with the Olympics, I suppose it fit the theme, but it's the song I always skip on the album. However, get this for the B-sides, they are great (like PSB B-sides usually are!).
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like playing this game while I am watching TV, this is just right and entertaining enough for that puprose
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|Look, everyone else has summarized the movie better than I ever could. It's simply a laugh a minute, completely politically incorrect homage too, and parody of the big Michael Bay movies (and sorry, but I LIKED Armageddon). I will just say that it's worth every penny to hear Kim Jong Il sing 'I'm So Ronery' - That is all.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|like the easiness of using it, I have tried another version but for some reason it did not work as well when I downloaded this one.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I couldn't think of a better title for this review, but I've been a huge fan of the PSB's since I bought the 12\\" single of 'West End Girls' back in 1985 (yes, I'm old, but so are they, so stuff it, let's write a review).<br /><br />This time around, the boys have worked with Stuart Price, the producer de jour right now, responsible for Les Rhythm's Digitales (seriously, listen to them), Madonna's 'Confessions on a Dance Floor', Take That's 'Patience' and of course producing the music for the recent Pandemonium tour. Neil and Chris always say that each album is a reaction to the last and after Elysium's beautiful, but rather more sedate songs, this album is, in their own words, 'banging' It's not a 'return to form', it's just a great, great 'up' album and I love the way the boys alternate between the more beautiful stuff and this kind of thing.<br /><br />I will, however, agree that it's a spiritual successor to 'Very', the last really 'up' PSB album. If you are looking for a ballad, you won't find it here and I've been dancing round my living room ever since I first played this. It makes me want to visit what the young people of today apparently call a 'Discotheque' :-)<br /><br />Let's go track by track:<br /><br />1. Axis - Almost an instrumental apart from Neil muttering stuff about 'turning it on' and 'Electric' - maybe they forgot to pay the utility bill, I don't know, but this is a great introduction to the album and likely a statement of intent for what's to follow. This track benefits, in my opinion, the most from Price's knob twiddling and sounds both like classic PSB and a cutting edge dance track at the same time (the PSB's? Cutting edge dance? Who knew?)<br /><br />2. Bolshy - My personal favorite on the album. A spiritual successor to 'Paninaro', this is up, bouncy and has a killer hook in it's 'Bolshy Bolshy Bolshy-O' chorus. Raise your voice indeed.<br /><br />3. Love is a Bourgeois Construct - The pretentious (and so PSB) title leads into a bit of a PSB epic, sampling 'Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds' from the film 'The Draughtsman's Contract'. Full of PSB staples including choirs, drinking tea, riff-raff and Karl Marx. Just a great pop song.<br /><br />4. Fluorescent - One part Visage's 'Fade to Grey', one part 'Stuart Price bleeps', one part, PSB lyrics 'At midnight, it's time for business' A little more downbeat than the other songs, but still fits the album perfectly.<br /><br />5. Inside a Dream - Very, 'Very' sounding :-) - It's got bells. It's got an insistent and addictive beat. It makes me dance. One of the most 'PSB' sounding songs on the album.<br /><br />6. The Last to Die - Bruce Springsteen track made to sound typically sad by Neil's mournful vocals. What's that? A dance beat? You can't dance to a Springsteen song? Oh hang on, you can. An unlikely cover, but they make it work.<br /><br />7. Shouting in the Evening - Quite a bizarre track. Pretty hard dance beats, for some reason, it reminds me of 'Yesterday, When I Was Mad'. Really, really good to dance to, but don't play it to your Grandma, she won't understand. Love Chris's 'Feels so Good' chant in the background.<br /><br />8. Thursday - As other's have said, this could have come off 'Please'. If there is such a thing as a standard PSB song, this is the closest and the nearest to a typical pop song on the album. A brilliant track that gets raised to a whole new level when Example's rap and vocal kick in. Quite possibly a new PSB classic and (I hope) a shoe-in as a single.<br /><br />9. Vocal - Take a derivative 80's rave song, drag it into the 2000's, replace the vocal's, replace the music, modernize it, mix well, and dance for hours. Yes, that's confusing, it sounds like it's from the 80's, but also sounds like it's completely modern. Look, I'll shut up and you can judge for yourself. This is an amazing, up, dancey, euphoric and bloody brilliant song.<br /><br />To sum up, thanks Neil and Chris, pop granddads. Go put on your slippers,have a nice cup of tea and then get up and make us more music!!!!!<br /><br />I love, love, love this album.have a nice cup of tea and then get up and make us more music!!!!!<br /><br />I love, love, love this album.
B005NYGPU2|5.0|Connected to my laptop to allow free movement when using the office phone answering system which was only a wired setup. Now configured and hands free and comfortable!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I'm a Mahjong player &amp; connoisseur of the game. ;)  This app offers several styles &amp; templates to choose from plus it's challenging &amp; fun!<br />Great FAOTD!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It didn't have much substance to the story.  And of course it ended with another book having to be purchased in order to finish the story.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This movie is basically Romeo and Juliet in Zombieland. It was cute and kept my interest, however it was too cliche.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I have heard about this film for years and I'm glad I finally had a chance to watch it!  The suspense and storytelling is ahead of its time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app ever for anyone who wants to get closer to God. Also to the guy who wrote before me, I accidentally hit no on the thing, nothing personal.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I just love the complications of this game, still haven't passed room 9 yet.  I will continue to try.  Great game.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|a very compelling novel that moves from usa to Canada. the boy, Dell, is torn between love for his family and his own integrity. Intriguing characters help him to a positive existence
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This started as a fun FREE app but the horses need all these snacks in order to be HAPPY to reform. And guess what? You gotta BUY the snacks. I deleted it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|The game is fun but it makes you have to buy things to level up faster. The features are nice though.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because the way the game works is horrible I apologize to anyone who like this game
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I can't say that I fully enjoyed this book. It was interesting, but I didn't feel closure with all the characters. I felt the storyline itself was kind of weak. I know others have really enjoyed this book. It wasn't my cup of tea.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a lot of fun and very, very amazing graphics!! I enjoy the Swype movements and the tilting of the screen.
1451695187|5.0|If it weren't for Dr Eben's background I'd see this as one more fairytale- What a fascinating possibility. I've since purchased more of this book for friends.
0316247545|5.0|I was really surprised at the quality of this book. Considering you only pay a portion of what most hardcover books after discounts (I got mine for ten bucks or so) you get an exceptional product. The cover was very sturdy and hard, the binding was solid. It was even bound with a headband - a  feature rarely seen on such low-cost books.<br /><br />Also of note is the sheer quantity of content. Again contrary to what the price indicates, you get an amazing wealth of MLP knowledge complete with several full color vectors and drawings. You get a full 256 pages of content covering everything from character bios and development to episode synopses.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that I would have loved to have seen more production artwork and concept sketches, but that is such a minor note. If you are a fan of the show, this is definitely worth your money.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|At least this one had enough action in it. My feeling is that they made book 7 into 2 movies to maximize profits. There were some lengthy and quite boring scenes in both part 1 and part 2. It could have been condensed into something better.
0062280228|2.0|I tried to like it. The plot development is so derivative though, and the characters are simplistically archetypal. I kept thinking that maybe Gaiman was trying to work out the pain of an extramarital affair that his own father had, at the readers expense.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I feel this movie was lengthened with too much dialog and slow movement just so they could make a second movies out of it and make more profits.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter likes this kit very much.Plus the added pink container keeps her placing them into the box after playing with them.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I found this episode somewhat boring compared to teh first 5. Not sure why that was, but it just didn't have as much action as I expecetd. It;s okay and necessary to complete the series
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|A lot of the reviews mention how dangerously violent Travis is. They fail to mention how dangerously stupid the heroine is. I think I would be punching walls and throwing around stuff as well if I was involved with Abby. It is impossible to list all the numerous instances of Abby's fickleness. Jeez. This heroine brought the benchmark for Too Stupid ( and annoying) To Live to an all time low. Way to go, Abby, for dethroning Bella Swan as Queen of Terrible Female Role Models. Don't read this, and DONT LET YOUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER READ THIS. Abby is not someone you want your daughter to emulate. And for those who are Travis haters, I have to say this much: he could have found someone a whole lot better to become obsessively in love with! These YA/NA hero/ stalker types clearly have NO TASTE in women. Come on, authors, quit insulting your female readers and give us a decent heroine!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is just as good a spider solitare game as the one that comes as part of Windows, and very similar in operation.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I am a devoted Gaiman fan but this disappointed me. There was a bit of magic in the story arc but overall it seemed flat and uninspiring.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A little on the tough to win side as electronic solitaire goes.  You can instruct it to give you a &#34;winable&#34; deal, but only if you are on line at the time.
B000W198QY|5.0|I had this CD years ago and had to download it when I saw it. Great music to get me  through my day.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Don't waste your time, watch something else. Mediocre graphics, silly plot, sillier screenplay. I'm afraid Thor dropped his hammer on this one.
B008ROGQAE|4.0|this is a great old movie to watch.  Yul Brynner is always worth watching.  It's been years since I saw this movie, I'm glad I watched it again.
B003DCJA94|2.0|In total, there was probably only 15-20 minutes of interesting &#34;movie&#34; in here.  The storyline could be more interesting, but the entire movie jumped around with nonsense for the first hour and the last half hour.  This is also not one of Vanessa Redgrave's finest performances.  The whole thing is just poorly laid out, poorly executed and boring.
0062059963|1.0|I absolutely loved the first book, it was great! But the Elite was not good. It just made me depressed. Maxon is now deciding between Kriss and America, wow, not cool. I honestly don't want to bash on the author but this book needs help
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I got this to see some different styles of Mahjong boards.  The game functioned flawlessly and there are many different options as far as tiles and boards.  It's definitely a time-killer.
B000002GBD|5.0|I bought this because when I was a kid I couldn't get enough of the tune &#34;Hair of the Dog&#34; I swear I played that song over and over until I wore out the grooves.<br /><br />Flash forward to now, and I am so stoked to have this again, but for more reasons than just that one song.<br /><br />From start to finish, this album is awesome.<br /><br />&#34;Changin' Times&#34; is probably my favorite cut. What a killer groove!
0525478817|5.0|I read this book after reading some of Greens other work.  I was most excited about this one, but I was reading them in release date order so I waited.  Even after all the hype I still thought that this book was one of the best books I ever read.  I found the writing style so easy to be absorbed into and the storyline was enchanting and I could not stop reading it.  I have now read this book around 5 times and each time, I find myself in tears when ever I reach certain moments of the book.  The book is heart breaking and unpredictable and is just an emotional rollercoaster that everyone should ride.  I would recommend this book to everyone I know.
B002JIEYL2|5.0|What can I say? Black Sabbath is one of the greatest bands of all time.<br /><br />To me anyway.<br /><br />This album is awesome. Get it now!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A book I could not put down.  This is a spell binding historical novel. Addictive. I can't wait for #3.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums by Tom Waits. Each track pictures a smokey bar with heartbroken patrons and old Tom sitting at a old and dented piano, singing the songs that describe the souls of each patron. This album sounds great no matter what the setting, but my advice would be to put this album on some sort of portable music device and listen to it in the dead of night (cigarettes aren't required, but are recomendded). Then this album will truly speak
B0014JKJJI|2.0|Shoe feels great but the quality is not what I expected.  The tread on the bottom of shoes is starting to detach after wearing them for one week!
B000FBJFSC|2.0|I do not recommend this book to anyone.  It was a very sad novel full of despair, pain, sickness, and poverty.  I was tempted several times to stop reading the novel.  No great ending.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Sound clicks in headphones and static noice too sometimes. Depends on other WiFi networks i think.<br />Same with the microphone.<br />Driver problem with downsampling surround to stereo when playing youtube flash videos. Only right speaker is active when decoding when in stereo mode. (Driver issue in combination with flash player)
B0049J0CTM|4.0|I thought this was a very cute movie.  Love the different accents of the characters.  I would recommend it to all ages.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Miles and Slash are great together. This is an  Awesome album all the way through. I recommend it to everyone.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Interesting dialog and easy to follow story with more to come or so I have heard.  Looking forward to more
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|After watching both part 1 and part 2 I thought it was well written and the movie was such a joy to watch, not violent, no bad language and was a real love story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really fun game! I love brain teased games and this game is really packed full of them.  I wish there were more levels available
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Well first of all on kindle fire dose no repeat what u say so all u can do is feed him hit him and other stuff ): don't get on kindle fire
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Obviously good for younger children..adults not so much, but still somewhat amusing. Predictable with nice heart- warming ending. Starts slow...
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is similar to Galaga, but you do not have to keep pressing fire the key.  Being able to move with your finger makes it more  fun, and you do not have to spend a bunch of quarters.
B008WOULPK|5.0|So full of wonderful stories of fashion. Eye opening book of what it takes to bring fashion to life in magazines. A truly interesting person.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|The movie could have been great....except it was 1hr and 55min long but took 2 hrs and 45 min to watch because of poor connection with Amazon......very poor service.  It really ruined how good this movie COULD have been.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a super duper great game. what's more fun then bananas. minons and slides.sounded good to me. haaave somebody fun.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Parts of the story are so powerfully written, detailed, real, heartbreaking. Some of the plot gets a little thin, but overall a really good book.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I'm not an Android person, but the Amazon MP3 app helped with the transition. The interface and navigation could be friendlier for first time users (maybe a tutorial). After becoming familiar with the product, accessing songs in your Library, Cloud, and Store became a breeze.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow! Graphics are great. No redundancy like in hidden objects games. Fireproof put a lot of thought into the creation of this game. I like how it makes me use my noggin. Please develop more like this Fireproof.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Unfortunately I can't really give the product a complete fair review on what it is designed for as I have two android devices that charge off of it.  Although I would imagine it probably is one of the only devices that would charge an Android and an Apple device at full speed simultaneously considering what I've read about most dual port charges can only charge one device at full speed and the other at a slow/trickle charge.  Thankfully both Android devices I have charging off of it are rooted and have a specialty ROM installed.  This gives me the ability to charge both phones at full speed as the android device being plugged into the Apple port needs to have a special kernel module loaded to take advantage of the full charging capabilities, otherwise it would only charge at USB speeds (5v 500mA.)<br /><br />That being said...with the one android smartphone plugged into the Android port, and the other Android smartphone with the kernel module loaded and plugged into the Apple port, both phones show that they are charging in AC mode (5v at least 1A).<br /><br />The only real reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it would be nice if there were designs/models that would allow for two Android devices or two Apple devices.  Checking the web page it seems all of their dual port chargers are 1 Apple, 1 Android.<br /><br />Otherwise the device works exactly as it should as far as I can tell as I don't have an Apple device to test. Although being that both Android devices fast charge simultaneously with a slight software mod on one of them, I would believe it would work correctly with one Apple, one Android.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I enjoyed this book although  it was a little confusing at times but overall a good book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the afterlife or who believe in angels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is much better than granny run. thank you guys. I would recommend it to everyone.<br />great job guys. love it love it. I don't have anymore to say. I do wish that you could use the bananas to purchase more things.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book and can't wait to get started on the next one \\" losing hope\\" a really awesome read!
0812993357|3.0|This book reads like a diary and she certainly  hung out with an in crowd but I found it superficial and maybe that is all FASHION has to offer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP I have a horse.and the horse I have on here looks just like her.I LOVE IT!!!!!
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|I got this free app to help with storage problems.  Didn't do anything for that but it did speed up my Kindle a bit.  I fixed my storage problem by resetting my Kindle to factory settings.  It deleted everything except my purchased items; so I was happy about that.  It cleared my storage out almost completely.  As for this app, since it's free, it's worth it.
B00008CMR6|5.0|One of John Wayne's finest. It starts out near the end of the Civil War with John Wayne as a colonel in charge of a gold shipment. The Rebs manage to hijack his train and take the gold. This sequence is one of the better train robberies depicted in any western IMO.<br /><br />After the war the colonel goes after the guy who sold him out. A couple of former Rebs need his help as a local land baron is trying to steal their land with the help of a corrupt sheriff. Turns out the land baron is the guy that sold out the gold shipment.<br /><br />Jennifer O'Neil plays the come on girl for a snake oil salesman the sheriff murders. She does not do all that bad for having no experience what so over in acting.<br /><br />The Duke and his pals deal with the bad guys in the usual way.<br /><br />The movie borrows elements from other westerns the Duke did, but it is still the Duke at his finest.<br /><br />Lots of action, well filmed, nice scenery. What more can one ask from a western?
B005DJREJS|5.0|This is the common Teen's life, it has Love, Bullying and Best friends. This is a good show, I Highly recommend this show to everyone Even parents of teens!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I read the book and usually I like the book more than the film.  This film was the exception.  I liked it a lot more than the book!  The cast was excellent!  Have watched it three times and I'm so glad to have it to watch again.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Hate the new look.  Too many graphic, too many pages to scroll through.  Not streamlined enough.  Please go back to the old program.  Much easier to use and view.  I don't want to keep jumping pages.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Need the next book...so now I nave to wait til the fall or winter? But at least I won't be alone ...I dragged a pack of women into this .....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved everything about this show the twists and turns the romance the old world coming to age. Cannot wait till the new season starts!
B003XDZNLW|5.0|The Women's shayna croc flat is good looking while still giving the room Crocs<br />provide better than any other shoe.  I am pleased with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome I every one I let play get for them selves and they all love it.
0345803485|1.0|After all the publicity for this book and rave reviews I added my name to the list at my local library......this has to be one of the worst books I have EVER tried to read......I don't even think it is worth the one star.....Slow moving...and it seems to me most of the people jumped on the wagon because they thought there were suppose to like it........Don't even bother.....I guess I was expecting more steam and it to move faster...but it was slow and stupid...don't even waste your time on this book.....
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The great powerful oz,some will say little to long Sammy say it has great story line and great special effects, and like the old one ,wizard of oz. this was I think taken some time after with a little twist into it and had open ended so more likely a second one will more likely come out. With this in mind I give it four stars your truly Sammy thanks a million
B0095MVOMC|3.0|Pretty boring - no originality  ... glad it was free or I would have rated it lower ...not so good
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Very strong housing, clear marking and highly recommended. Charge is quick and the unit looks great for any Apple or Droid products
B005DJREGQ|5.0|If I had to describe this show n two words it would have to be really funny. I wish seson three was free as well
B002W7H3EA|5.0|NORTH BY NORTHWEST is simply one of the finest motion pictures ever made.  It enthralls in every way:  the script, acting, plot, theme, music, photography, and design of the film transcend time and place.  I watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST now as I watched it decades ago--with admiration for the director's craft and empathy for the story's beleaguered protagonist.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  It really does make you wonder about the powers of the universe.  I recommend it very much.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Love it! Great relaxing fun. Gets more challenging as you go but stays relaxing. Would recommend. Have first generation Kindle Fire.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works and there isn't much else to say. It's a USB cable and not much can go wrong, just saying because I needed at least one more word.  :-)
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I loved this movie and the score is outstanding. It was a nice build on what the composer had done in the first movie. I love that.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Most amazing book of all the books in the series. A totally awesome book that is appropriate for all ages over the age of 9.Definitely read this book.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is an outstanding score and the bonus tracks are well worth the extra money as is the metal case.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome app the only problems it has is that it glitches a little bit but other than that it's pretty cool
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game, love listening to the cute minions. it is challenging and lots of fun. It is a great game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is addicting!  I just couldn't put it down.  Instead of housecleaning I sat and read and read.  I was only sorry when I finished it!
B007V65R54|5.0|As someone who spends a lot of time forecasting potential brand reveneues, the suggestions and observations raised in this book were of great value for me. Solid
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love having an ebay app on all of my devices. App is free and runs well. Shows all the basics. Can buy or sell from the app. Good app. Great for basics

B0017I1IZA|5.0|These books are always enjoyable to me. Although the formula is similar in each book the mysteries are good. I love the love triangle, however I feel like she's a Morelli girl at least so far. Fun read especially if you are invested in the series.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great scenery, love the ladies, the cast was very interesting.  I totally enjoyed this movie.  I will definitely watch it again!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The format,  as others have bemoaned,  is that the story evolves from post-apocalypse survivor interviews. The result is a stilted, patchwork storyline. It's as if no novelist/historian survived the zombie conflict, and the only person left to compile the historic narrative is an NPR intern armed with a microphone and tape recorder.<br /><br />I do enjoy a good post-apocalypse yarn, but, this was just not my cup of tea. I purchased and read this novel because I was anticipating seeing the movie. Well,  after the movie's reviews and box office performance, I will wait for it to come out on Netflix.

B00DJXSKWU|2.0|As my headline says I'm glad I only paid $1.00 for this game, at least I didn't waste too much. Graphics are great I admit it, but I was hoping to get something akin to the Mechcommander franchise, although it bears some resemblance to this venerable game, there were a lot of annoying differences, for instance if you surrender a mission, like I had to due to time constraints I could not return to that same mission, also the documentation is a bit sparse, I found myself using trial and error to do just the basic things required just to get the mission off the ground. To be fair I only actually played 3-4 missions, lost interest after that. Again I'm glad it was only $1.00, if I paid more I would have been more critical in my review, thanks to the development team nevertheless.
B0030MKGKY|4.0|I loved the realism of this movie. The violence isn't glorified, yet the film is still cinematic and exciting. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, got my attention with Blue Steel (1989), but The Hurt Locker (2008) is the first film that made me a fan of her work. The related film, Zero Dark Thirty (2012), is a masterpiece.

B002CAWNDS|3.0|The psychological thriller Obsessed (2009), may not have lofty aspirations, but it nicely achieves some of its goals, presenting a provocative story involving some strong characters, as a happily married lawyer, becomes the target of the fantasies of a temporary worker in his office.<br /><br />Idris Elba ([[ASIN:B0041QSZFG Luther]]) is Derek Charles, a successful account manager at a big investment firm, who is married to his former secretary Sharon, who is played by singer Beyonce Knowles ([[ASIN:B004EJTGTY Goldmember]]), appearing in her first real dramatic role.  When Derek meets Lisa (Ali Larter), he has no clue that the temporary worker, is about to turn his life upside down.<br /><br />The story isn't that complex, and has some rather large gaps in the plot, but what is presented is still pretty interesting, as Lisa attempts to manipulate Derek, before making an attempt to seduce him at a Christmas party.  Matters escalate, as Lisa later drugs Derek, and spends the night in his room.  What happens between them is unclear, in what seems like a real missed opportunity.  Matters reach a new level, when the couple's young son is threatened.  While certainly not as graphic as it could have been, and with practically nothing is revealed about Lisa's background, the strong performances of the three leads, helps to make up for some of the deficiencies in the story, which plays much like a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />Ali Larder ([[ASIN:B001AQMBHI Final Destination]], [[ASIN:B004DAG1SS Heroes]]) does a convincing job of flirting with insanity.  Playing a toned down role, Idris Elba is impressive working with either leading lady.  Also an executive producer for the movie, Beyonce Knowles does well in a dramatic role, which also features an extended fight sequence at the finale.  The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell, and Christine Lahti.<br /><br />Although much that happens is quite predictable, and often defies logic, some may find Obsessed to be fairly entertaining.  The screenplay doesn't take a lot of chances, but builds to a climactic fight between the two women, that while not spectacular, is competently executed, and a glass table begging to be shattered, does play a prominent role.  However, unless you're really into checking out the flawless makeup job on Beyonce and Ali Larter, getting the Bluray probably isn't a must.ning.

B00ABKGG0C|3.0|Let's be honest : we are trying to fend off the pangs of withdrawal pending the publication of George R. R. Martin's next opus. And most recently published fantasy fares badly after GOT. Blood Song is not badly written, there is even an attempt at fooling the reader with a narrative within a narrative which turns out to be unreliable after all. The autour has created a coherent society,  But one has a sense of déjà vu : the military school where antagonistic cadets are welded into a band if brothers by stern taskmasters; the father and son story; the formulaic battles; the

B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book is interesting, though its format was quite different from his other books.  He writes about each character and their lives and leaves it for you to tie them together.  It certainly didn't have the same page turning excitement that his other books had.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada<br /><br />Operation Armada is the story of Naval Commander Ian Fleming as he attempts to gain control of the French Fleet after the German invasion of France during World War Two. This was a fast-paced, action filled, amazing spy story with the typical bond like love interests.<br />The writer, Damian Stevenson, created a truly believable story that came to life like I was watching a movie. The descriptions were so clear that I felt like I was part of the story itself. I'm not much of a war story person, but I loved this book. It grabbed my attention from the beginning and kept my interest until the end. I loved it, and would recommend it as a story worth reading.<br />Lynda Kaye Frazier
0920668372|5.0|This is a precious story of a baby and his mother through the years.  From the time the baby is born, through the terrible two's, to teen age years and young adult moving out, the mother finds her young son and picks him up and rocks him singing &#34;I'll love you forever, I'' like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.'  Up to the time the grown man has to lift his feeble mother up and rock her, rock her, rock her singing 'I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my mommy you'll be'...... I tear up every time I read it and it is still a favorite of MY babies who are now 25 and 29.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much.  It gave me a different take on a end of the world scenerio.  The love story is warm and comforting in a horrible setting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wan't going to be one of the many that flocked to the Hunger Games series, but ended up seeing the movie, liking it, getting curious about the books and then reading them.  Honestly, I was hooked.  I borrowed them on my Kindle and could not wait for the first of the month to borrow the next and then burned through it too fast.  I was only sorry the series ended.  I really, really loved the story, the character development, the friendships and loyalties and the romance.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I love the colorful characters and the creative weaving of the heaven/hell eternal war. I found it to be a quick read because I couldn't put it down.  On the second book and it is even better!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I totally loved all three of these books. I feel I know these characters. I loved how she did the add- ons at the end of the story. I hope to hear more from E.L. James!
B001O8D47S|3.0|I don't know if anybody noticed: throughout the movie there were only women. Even the extras in street scenes were women only.<br />It wasn't until the very end that there was a little baby boy born :)
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Along the lines of Hunger Games and Divergent this is a young adult trilogy.  Although I myself left the category of &#34;young adult&#34; years ago, I still enjoy good stories with interesting characters and plots.  This series fits the bill.  A teenage girl discovers she is not the ordinary human she thought she was.  Along the way she finds out she is a part of the Shadowhunters whose lives are spent destroying demons.  Along the way she meets other Otherworldly characters.  Thoroughly enjoyed.

B0087ZG7UW|4.0|As a child, Psycho scared the daylights out of me and I had nightmares for months.  Now as an adult, I did not get nightmares but this movie was the thriller I remembered it.  Hitchcock was always the master of suspense/horror movies.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|If I had rated this app before the update, I would have given it at least 4 stars. But now I can barely stand it, and I'm considering getting rid of it. There is so much useless content on it now. Also if you do certain things, you get points. What the points are for I have no idea. All I want from my weather app is weather, none of this pointless crap that has nothing to do with weather.<br />Very disappointed in this app.

0375842209|5.0|Cannot put into words how this book has changed me. The writing was simply beautiful and the characters made my heart ache. This book blew me away and has not left my mind even after finishing its last words. This will be a book I constantly revisit to remind myself just how good life is, and just how hard others have had it, and how important it is to expose our hearts and minds to stories such as Liesel's. I will never be the same after reading The Book Thief....and I am glad for that.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|This is a two-part review:<br /><br />Part 1, Content.<br /><br />Bourdain is not a writer, he's a cook, and it shows.  That's not to say this book is *bad*, but it ain't no \\"Les Miserables\\", and the writing style can be a little jarring at times.  But that's actually good in this case, because it helps make it feel more real, more like a guy telling a story than a writer writing a book. He is spouting anecdotes and just happened to decided to write them down.<br /><br />Are there parts of this book that are offensive? Yes. Is this book vulgar?  Highly. Is it worth the read?  That depends. Do you like Jack Kerouac or Chuck Palahniuk? If you do, you will like this book.<br /><br />I really liked this book. But I suspect that there are many who wont. It'll likely be polarizing -- you'll either love it or hate it, there will be little middle ground.<br /><br />Part 2, the Kindle eBook.<br /><br />Oh. My. God. Did the publisher not have the eBook proofread before it went on sale? It is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />It looks like someone did a scan-and-OCR of the paper book pages to create the ebook.  There are myriad places where a 'l' (lower-case L) appears where an '!' (exclamation point) should be. There are commas that are replaced with periods. Hyphens appear in the middle of words for no reason, like they are an artifact of a paperback novel or something.<br /><br />You can read around these and use context clues to figure out the problems, but you shouldn't have to. It is inexcusable, and it shows laziness on the part of the publisher.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is such an enjoyable movie that is about what professional retired people can still do with their lives if they so choose to.  Anyone in their Senior years should not just hunker down and give in but to live life to it's fullest.  A movie where there is no sex, no violence but yes they do swear a bit but it's funny.  It's one of those times when it just pops out of the mouth without the brain thinking first.<br /><br />I truly love Maggie Smith and try to watch all her productions.  She is among my top favorites along with a few others that she sometimes pairs up with and they are just so wonderful and present a life in a time that is no longer but hasn't been forgotten completely.  If you are in the mood for just a nice simple evening then give this one a try.  Dustin Hoffman directs this lovely piece.

B00C0FMQQE|4.0|I recently read Zero Day, by Mark Russinovich. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I read the last 100 pages late on a Saturday evening because I just couldn't put it down. I work in the technology field, running my own tech support company, and found all too much of what Mr. Russinovich wrote about, to be all too true. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in reading techno/science fiction. I already read the second book, Trojan Horse, and can't wait for the third.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|I love this book. The Kindle Edition is a great edition of this book.<br /><br />For those of you not familiar with Vonnegut's style of writing, it is one of the most unorthodox styles of writing. He goes on wild tangents and jumps freely between times in this book. However, he does it so well that you never find yourself lost when reading this book. And it helps that the book does not lack any humor.<br /><br />This is a great book—and in my opinion Vonnegut's best work. A definite mus read.
0553381407|5.0|This self-help book is very good. Dr. Forward pulls no punches here, and offers many useful tips to those recovering from parental abuse suffered during childhood. Worth while!
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I always find it hard to review books without giving away too much of the plot or details, so I tend to keep them very brief.<br /><br />I really found myself enjoying this book. It's a fascinating take on what they thought the future would be like, and I was suprised to see a few things that we are using now that the book had predicted, such as the tablets they use to read the papers.<br /><br />It's a great read regardless if you have seen the film or not.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I chose to read these books because the movie coming out looked interesting but I wanted to read the books before I saw the movie.The first book City of Bones is captivating but has a bit of a shaky start. After the second book I was hooked!  I can't wait to see what happens next!
B009LGO88E|5.0|I now have my Nintendo 3DS XL permanently mounted on this thing. For people with large hands, this is a must!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great ergonomics for those with large hands.<br />- The second thumb pad makes playing games like Resident Evil Revelations and Kingdom Hearts that much easier to play. It really enhances the games.<br />- The battery seems to last forever. I have not changes the battery since I got it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It makes your 3DS XL bulkier.<br />- The R trigger on games that do not support the Circle Pad Pro is a little hard to reach (as it uses the original R trigger found on the 3DS XL).<br /><br />If you don't mind the extra bulk, the Circle Pad Pro is a great attachment for your 3DS XL.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|this movie just works.  the dynamic between all the characters, the story.  watch it.  enjoy it.  They did a wonderful job.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|Decent flick by today's standards (I guess)  The remake offers more gore and a bit more backstory in the characters, however completely lacks the \\"Insanity\\" I was expecting.  Once again everything that made the original a success was left out in the update. Our favorite scenes are either altered or cut, which is always a huge let down. Is there a director out there that can brings us a remake that just improves on acting & special effects?  I seriously can't be the only one who wants this.  If you must add a new twist... fine,  just do it without losing the magic of the original. If you must go with a new version or vision just make it a sequel, it's much more acceptable to any hardcore fan.  Of course I'll keep watching them...but only because I'm hopeful.

0061726834|5.0|This was an excellent read!  I enjoyed every single page, and found myself checking to see what page I was on to see how much longer the thrill that is Delirium would last.  I tried to read more slowly than usual, and even considered putting the book down to read something else for a while, but my efforts were in vain: Delirium is the kind of page-turner that is impossible to put down.<br /><br />Parallels between Oliver's world in Delirium and other popular dystopian novels (for me, they were 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, and The Giver) will be inevitable.  I think it's nearly impossible to read a book and not compare it to others in the genre.  I know that it is hard for me not to compare books, especially when the book in question is as good as Delirium is.  Delirium is one of those books that will easily hold its own in comparisons.<br /><br />Lena is a different kind of heroine: she is a believer in the cure for the disease that is love and eagerly counts down the days until her scheduled treatment.  She wants nothing more than to be happy and content.  All of her beliefs are challenged; however, when she meets a young man by chance one day and starts feeling the beginnings of the deliria.  At first, Lena fights the impulse to be near him, and stubbornly clings to her hopes of placid normalcy after the much-anticipated treatment.  Over time, though, she can't resist the feelings being around him evoke and she gives in to love.  This part of the book really brought me back to how I felt when I fell in love with my husband.  Remember that can't eat, can't think feeling?  How all you wanted was to be with them?  How everything they did was perfect and you could spend hours in their presence and feel like only minutes had passed?  That's what I was remembering reading about Lena falling in love.  Lots of YA novels bring me back to this feeling (I think that's why I enjoy YA so much) but Delirium brought it to a whole new level.  I loved that about this book!<br /><br />There is a lot of attention to detail in this book, such as the quotes from different publications of the time at the beginning of each chapter that tell us bit by bit about the world Lena lives in.  The imagery is outstanding without being overly descriptive---I could picture so clearly different places in Portland, it felt like I was right there with Lena.<br /><br />Readers hoping for a mindless read and a superficial happily ever after will be disappointed.  This is the kind of read that people talk about, and feel the need to talk about after they've finished.  Delirium ended the way I wish Mockingjay would have ended.  If you want to know what I mean, you'll have to read it for yourself (or email me and I'll spill the beans).  I would recommend this book to anyone.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The ending felt a little predictable to me.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The whole book is about Lena growing up.  I think her personal growth really made the book for me./>There is a lot of attention to detail in this book, such as the quotes from different publications of the time at the beginning of each chapter that tell us bit by bit about the world Lena lives in.

0440244412|5.0|This was my favorite book in the series.  I thought Moning did an excellent job wrapping up the story.  Yes, there was one main question I had that was left unanswered, but that just makes me want to read the spin-off even more.  I kind of liked that not everything was resolved, because if it were, I think the ending would have felt too \\"pat,\\" a la Breaking Dawn.  Moning surprised me with the issue of Cruce and the issue of Alina's murderer.  I really enjoyed those plot twists.  All in all, the mythology and lore, as well as world-building, were superb in this series.

0061978078|5.0|I really didn't know how I could like Pandemonium more than Delirium (read my review of Delirium here), but I did.  In Delirium, Lena was still a product of the Society's twisted thinking.  She eventually grows and changes, but it is a slow process.  In Pandemonium, she is a totally different person.  She has been forced to grow up by the events at the end of Delirium.  (Plot spoiler for book one): Alex gave his life to save her and she keeps going on, even though she doesn't want to, to honor his sacrifice. (End spoiler).<br /><br />As much as Pandemonium is action-packed, it is also an emotional thrill ride.  I was riding the wave of Lena's emotions right along with her.  I felt all of her highs and lamented during her low points.  That is the pull of Lauren Oliver's writing: she just draws you in and you feel everything the characters are feeling.<br /><br />I loved watching Lena grow and change.  She morphs from a coddled girl who can't take care of herself to a (sorry to say this, but I have to) Katniss Everdeen-like character who always stands up for herself and does what has to be done to survive.<br /><br />I loved the plot twists: there were two that I really didn't see coming, and they added a lot of depth to the story.  I love how nothing in Lena's world is as it seems.  It really keeps you guessing throughout the whole book.<br /><br />And the ending, oh, the ending.  Lauren Oliver, how can you do this to us?!  Now I am on pins and needles waiting for book three. I simply cannot live with myself not knowing what will happen!<br /><br />If you haven't read Lauren Oliver before, I give her a very good recommendation.  She is an excellent author, and also is on my very short auto-buy list.  She is just that good!

1595141979|5.0|I love this series!  This was the best Vampire Academy book yet.  It has more depth, emotion, and action than Vampire Academy or Frostbite.  It is also much longer than the first two books, at 443 pages.<br /><br />In Shadow Kiss, the novice dhampir guardians are undergoing their field experience, where they are assigned to a Moroi student to guard for six weeks.  The novices will undergo surprise &#34;attacks&#34; from their guardian teachers to evaluate how effectively they can guard their Moroi.<br /><br />Rose is still dealing with the aftermath of the attack in Frostbite and as a result of that trip, has started seeing ghosts.  Her performance in the field experience suffers because she is so distracted.  She is afraid that she's going crazy but finally figures out what's going on.  As soon as she does; however, things get really bad at the academy.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />I had to read about the darkness inside of Rose just one too many times.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The development of the love story.

1250007208|4.0|Review:<br />This was such a different read.  I started the book having no idea what was going on, and to be perfectly honest, the beginning of the book did not wow me.  It took about 50 pages for me to really get interested in the story, but once I did I really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I don't know much about robots: I admit that I had to ask my husband what a cyborg was.  If you know what a cyborg is (see the Wikipedia page here) going into the story, you'll enjoy the story more.  I had to figure out over time that Cinder was actually born completely human, but was made part robot during a surgery in her childhood.  She is despised by her stepmother and one of her stepsisters.  They consider Cinder to be a lower-class citizen because of her cyborg status.  Cinder works as a mechanic and has to turn all of her money over to her greedy, lazy stepmother.  Her other stepsister--Peony--is her only human friend.<br /><br />If you haven't figured it out by now, Cinder is a retelling of Cinderella.  I've read several retelling of classic fairy tales lately and have really enjoyed them, and the genre as a whole.  Something about Cinder, maybe it was the fact that it is set in Asia (or what was once Asia) and the technology of the book, reminded me of Scott Westerfeld's Extras.  Which is not a bad thing---Westerfeld's Uglies series is outstanding work.<br /><br />My favorite thing about Cinder was Cinder herself.  She is strong and so persistent.  She never gives up, despite everything that goes wrong around her.  I liked how she slowly developed feelings for Kai---their relationship was very sweet.  I especially liked the Lunar people and their &#34;magic&#34;.  That element of the story added a lot of depth and interest to the book.  The drama surrounding Kai and Queen Levana kept me guessing as to how the story would end, and it has me really looking forward to the second book in the series.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Cinder.  The slow start made way for a strong finish, and I will definitely be looking forward to the next book in the series.finish, and I will definitely be looking forward to the next book in the series.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I got it then I tried to play it and my tablet froze at 70 percent then I shut it off and tried again same thing.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|Simply put this is about feral kids and the spectral caretaker.  The kids do creepy well, Annabelle - excellent, the actor Logan could be an american Sean Bean so yum - 7 on the almost Bean scale.<br />The tension builds.  Once the children are returned to society and end up housed by an institute in what looks like everyone definition of home, they are cared for by their father's (who took the kids to the woods in the first place) brother.  Their mother's sister get visitation.  They also talk regularly to our window in, a psychiatrist, who is has a blistering need to be a parapsychiatrist.  He helps us put the story of Mama together.  This is an excellently shot film, not that greyed out thing that seems popular. The script is tight and I just love the Archivist!  She is the true heart of the film.  Buuutt...<br />You know there is this moment that kicks you out of a movie or a book. I hate that moment. Spoiler coming up - I have been waiting to rent the horror movie Mama since it came out in theaters (I will not pay for a pg-13 horror movie). So going along, getting wound up in the dark room, putting together the pieces of who and what Mama is. Then we see Mama and she tries to kill Annabelle. Little girl screams because the nosy Aunt has just broken into the house. Mama sinks into the floor and becomes the evil wig from hell. And there I lost it. There I'm gone. A wig squirming around the floor chasing the nosy aunt takes an otherwise scary movie and kills it. Please, if you write or direct films, never have a evil wig from hell. Unless you are Sam Raimi - he might pull it off. Everyone else - use a shadow, a stain, just not an evil wig from hell.

B0011UBDTK|2.0|I should have paid close attention to the reviews before I bought this last November. I am just now getting around to watching disc 3 of season 3 and when I tried to play the disc it started freezing up, making it unwatchable. I thought it was a problem with my computer but now I can see that it must be a manufacturing defect as numerous other people have mentioned having the same problem. That is at least five episodes that I will now be missing. I have also experienced consistent problems with the sound quality in most of the episodes. Whenever the characters are at a bar, party, art show, etc. and there is music playing in the background, the music is so loud that you can't hear any of the speaking parts. Save your money because this set is not worth $189.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a good brain challenge as you find the clues and match them with which puzzle they belong.  I can't wait for updates.
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|The title was attractive but the content was more of a personal history rather than a methodology that could be applied to learning environments.  If you want to read about someone's personal quest to acquire new hobbies this is for you.  If you are looking for a sound teaching/training methodology, look elsewhere.  I had different expectations for this book.

0345803485|3.0|I'm not someone who thinks that if I'm going to read trash, it should be well-written trash.  I think that if I'm going to read trash, it should be really trashy. On the plus side, this book is kinky and erotic, and it's part of the pop culture.  On the minus side, it's degrading, chauvinistic, and ridiculous.  So what if the writing is mediocre?  It's still better written than The DaVinci Code, and it's quite the page-turner, in its own appalling way.  So many women in my over-the-hill age group have read this book that I assumed the protagonist to be our age.  Wrong.  The heroine, if you want to call her that, is recent college graduate Anastasia Steele (Ana for short) who loses her virginity to Christian Grey, who seems perfect in every way--rich, smart, sophisticated, and gorgeous.  Christian, however, is interested in submissive women only and expects them to sign a non-disclosure agreement and a pact that basically relegates them to slave status, complete with corporal punishment.  This was a big turnoff for me, but Ana faces the dilemma of deciding how much she is willing to sacrifice to keep from losing him.  The book is not devoid of humor, either; the email exchanges, especially the subject lines, are priceless.  This is the only manner of communication in which Ana can be brutally honest, as Christian just intimidates her too much in person. Christian, on the other hand, divulges as little as possible about his background, but he obviously has survived some very dark times.  The author would have us believe that there's give and take on both sides, as Ana tries to be what Christian thinks he needs, and Christian tries to be more of a normal boyfriend.  What I found most disturbing was that Ana is turned on by Christian's sadistic ways.  She may be good for him, but she can't seem to find her equilibrium in this warped relationship.  She obviously has him wrapped around her little finger, so why put up with all the scary stuff?  Well, because she likes some of it, sort of.  At least now I know what all the fuss is about.
1451627289|4.0|It was a gift but it came on time and the recipient loves the book.  I would recommend to others
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Really enjoyable - should be a hit for years to come if they keep the writing fresh.  Yup. Yup. Yup.
B004XNGKBS|2.0|Needs an update I decided to pay for the &quot;pro&quot; version but it's exactly the same as the free one. So I feel like I wasted my money. Needs more options on the kindle fire hd. I can't get it to work on the kindle fire hd very well it's very splouchy I've bought about 10 different pens/stylus and they barely work with this app. I hope it updates before school
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|THE GAME WILL OPEN AND THE VIDEO IS FUNNY BUT IT WONT FULLY LOAD. PLEASE PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 3 year old loves loves loves this app. We started off with the free version and he liked it so much that I bought the full version which gave him more things to do. He likes seeing each patient and being able to customize their beds to make them happy. He loves giving the shots and putting the band-aids on because he can relate to things like that. There are so many cute and fun animations and procedures that you can do with the patients.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really like it a lot.  i found some of it very difficult and exasperating.  i would recommend it to anyone who likes to be challenged.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Drama does not get any better! Our whole family is addicted. Maggie Smith alone is worth the price. Guest appearances by Shirley McClaine are a hoot.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|This is a romper stomper non-stop party record. I'm obsessed with the beats. I hear small different things on each listen. Stop reading and buy it already! This album needs to be heard not read. It's that dam good.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|One of Tarentino's two or three best. A great adventure narrative, and also politically brave and insightful. Takes us closer to the real complexity and ugliness of the Old South's slavery system than many history books. Acting is uniformly great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a lot of fun. Some levels are harder than others so it keeps it interesting. good game. glad I got it!
B002ONIST6|4.0|Well filmed, well written, well acted. Has some very insightful and striking scenes, such as the protagonist's encounter with the Boss drug dude, deep in the Southeast Asian jungle, or the scene in which Frank burns the fur coat, mad at himself for succumbing to the lure of ostentation. Have seen it four or five times; definitely rewatchable. Also: further proof that Denzel can do no wrong.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Awesome fun for all. &Ccedil;hallenges your head and hands. Kids will love the good; clean entertainment for hours of play.
B00CIS1OKW|3.0|A bit hodge-podgy, but a fair attempt at updating adventure fantasy inherent in the original fairy tale.Kids watching it with us got bored, though.
1466986743|4.0|Greenhurst, an abandoned hospital is the first venture outside Canada for the newly formed Coast to Coast Paranormal Investigation Team. It was Leigh MacLeod's--the founder and leader of the team--dream to gain access to this abandoned institution. Whereas other teams had failed, Leigh's team succeeded in gaining entry, although stringent rules were set out by the property owners: \\"You may not remain in the building after dark,\\" being just one. Thus the tone is set for the unexpected, and the unexpected did happen!<br /><br />The story takes the reader along on the investigation that can be seen from both sides of the paranormal experience. Regardless what is happening, or is about to happen, Leigh's mantra is: \\"Never stop recording until I say so.\\"<br /><br />If you are a a fan of abandoned places you might think twice if you are planning a visit after reading Coast to Coast Paranormal Investigations The Journey Underneath.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Somewhat involving, and well photographed and acted, but lacks narrative coherence and plausible character development. Too similar to L.A. Confidential; mainly effective in its making us want to watch the latter film as soon as this one was over.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Well book is good it has a lot about of detail. Over I say the book was a hole lot better than the movie.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I texted my brother in the first 15 min to let him know that so far, the goat in the opening scene was the best acting performance in the film. It proved true until the end.<br /><br />Don't waste your money....go see Pacific Rim in 3D
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new format has way too many ads, the videos were better and easier to look at and find, on the old format, Don'.t fix it if not broken, you did and now I.m looking for another weather app.
1582406634|5.0|I am immensely pleased by this product.  Mr. Cho's illustrations are gorgeous and he lavishes attention on them.  Particular favorites are some of his marvel pieces.  The artist in my is particularly pleased by this raw sketches found throughout the book.  His line work is nothing short of inspired.  Its a shame (not really a complaint) that we only get to see his handsome handling of color on the cover of this book as it is black and white.<br />  My only complaint is that the cover is a little on the flimsy side for how heavy the paper stock of the pages are.<br />Minor complaint aside, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Illustration.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I watched this movie because Maggie Smith was in it.  While the story was somewhat slow, there were enough laughs and poignant moments to keep me interested.  The heartwarming story of people living life no matter their age is a good one.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show.  The writing as well as the acting is outstanding.<br />I watch an episode or two every day!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A must read for anyone who love the Wizard of OZ.  This goes beyond the movie and was thoroughly enjoyable and I highly recommend it.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|The storyline/script is what it is so I gave it 4 stars, but the actors bring this very close to 5 stars.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved iron man and the hulk.When I first heard that Robert downey jr was playing the part of iron man I thought it would be a disaster role for him.But over the years he has taken  well to the character. I now see him as this overbearing arrogant billionaire playboy. I thought the hulk was also going to be a bad role but again the movie proved me wrong. Hulk was awesome till the end. Smash !!!
038572179X|5.0|An absolutely enjoyable read,  I highly recommend,  I also enjoyed many other titles by the same author and would recommend those as well

B0097C8XL0|5.0|We love this game.  Our child really enjoys the characters. The characters are great.  It is easy to steer. It keeps our child busy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good series. Definitely a series for adults only. Hard to put down between books. I think the storyline is great.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Great way to hang and /or mount your D battery mags. I use one clip to hang my mag vertically but if your gonna mount your horizontal I would use both clips on it. By brother in law had these mounted in his old pickups cab and the mag never fell out.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|If you like dramatic music, and spectacular percussion, then you could do a lot worse than to give this a try.<br />Some fun little goodies in the special edition too.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have used and loved the older version but mine recently updated. This new version is messy and complicated rather than clean and precise. I lost the longer time lapse on the map which I liked. Also there is no humidity or dew point information anymore. Plus there is all this points and acheivement nonsense.  I just want to check the weather, not  play games. I am uninstalling and finding something clean, basic and weather oriented.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show! It's very funny, well written and has a great cast. Jake Johnson and Zooey Deschanel are fabulous together! Can't wait for season 3!
B00006AW63|1.0|This DVD was made for a different region. We could not watch it and there was absolutely no information on the description that said it would not work in the US. I just wasted $20.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I do enjoy this game.  Sure its not the best graphics as far as the &#34;block look&#34; but I do like creating my own world.  One thing I noticed you do not get all the supplies as you do on the full version game.  That's a bummer.  I haven't played it on survival mode to see if that's any different.  Also too bad you can not convert your existing game to the Pocket Edition version.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have read both Davinci Code and Angels and Demons, seen both movies.  This was a very interesting read!
B000IBVRQW|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  All about love, justice for the poor and oppressed, and sticking to one's beliefs.  A beautiful rendition of Jane Grey's martyrdom.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|I had some kindle app points to spend and I would say of all the games that I could have gone with this one seemed to be unique and exceptionally entertaining without being a game where one has to think too much.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my Favorite book of the series. Its a Easy read, and it ends before you want it to.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Have started to play the game...still trying to learn it.  It is challenging my mind and I like to be challenged!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Yes it was supposed to be the finale,but it took me to the end wanting more. I like that. Can't wait to see what comes next.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Have played a few of these games for years and really enjoy to set down and just play the game and relax!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. I have been looking for this kind of game for a long time. There are some good 'escape the room' games that kept me occupied, but they were all missing something. This game has it! I felt like I was in it, as opposed to just playing it. Looking forward to the next chapter.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this game!!!! Can play it for hours. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play solitaire.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|It's been a while now since I've seen this, so I don't remember the details. But I do remember enjoying the movie quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but doable.  I like the puzzles with multi search areas best.  Great way to pass time while waiting in my doc's office.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|This was a gift for my mom.  I don't normally listen to Goulding, but my mom loves it and I have heard it several times in the car with her and I find her voice and stylings very pleasing.

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Daniel Pink challenges stereotypes about those who sell and changes the way we think about how we work ....again! His theory, that the ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is crucial to our survival and our happiness, is persuasively presented. He reminds us that selling our products and ourselves is part of who we are. Like all his works, this book also serves to remind us of the nobility of work in all its forms. This is the one business book everyone needs to read!<br />Edith Robb, president<br />Westmorland Communications
B007SGLZP8|4.0|He's done it again folks. Almost as clever as his first novel, The Firm, though he has since learned to keep us on the edge of our seats with more active plot drivers than copying machines.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Excellent!  From the start the characters were engaging and I felt like \\"part of the family\\" so to speak (and am very thankful that I am NOT part of any of these families as much as I enjoy reading about them)<br />From Book 1 until the last book, I was hooked!<br />Truly amazed to find that HBO followed the books so closely (given they \\"killed\\" True Blood/Sookie Stackhouse books. But they did say \\"Based\\" on the books with True Blood)<br /><br />I hate to give away spoilers, etc.  However, once you pick up book one you WILL be hooked and will put down whatever the last book is at the time you are reading them (as the series is not complete) wanting MORE!<br /><br />Characters you love to love and love to hate- plot with twists and turns that you do not expect.  You are taken places you never thought existed and are introduced to characters you never imagined you would meet.<br /><br />Take the book off the shelf (or find it on your Kindle, Nook, or other reader) and read it.  You will not go wrong.  (Unless you are looking for the XXX Romance novels or Vampire that Sparkle for unknown reasons or a Cookbook)<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B007THA4FI|2.0|If Rowling is setting out to prove she can write a non-Harry Potter story she has done so. This book has none of the warmth, charm, cleverness, or love of craft so visible in her earlier work. In fact, it is the very antithesis of those things, seeming to revel in its meanness, lack of sympathy, incoherent plot line and social nihilism. All those pages of problems and shortcomings and then not even a satisfying ending.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I loved the show, and how it really seemed to live up to its title.  Its a very good dramatization of the high school years for most people.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this series. Watching it without commercials makes it more interesting. There is nothing I dislike about this DVD. If you like vampire and wolf stories, then this series is for you.
0143038095|5.0|this looks like it will be a really good book for my daughter to read over her summer vacation. It was on<br />her reading list
B00B769XB8|4.0|I liked this movie. I went to the theater to see it and had to buy it. A different take on a childhood story.  It's an action/adventure movie with two great actors who do a great job portraying Hansel and Gretel. We have a 3D TV so we bought this one to watch it in 3D at home. I recommend this DVD.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love reviewing Facebook on my new kindle.  If I don't have the time to fire up the computer, I have a wonderful alternative to check my Facebook on the Kindle rather than on my phone.  Facebook is very easy to navigate on my Kindle and much easier to read than on my smart phone.  I can use my Kindle anyplace I have WiFi to check Facebook.  I recommend the Facebook app to anyone that has a Kindle and enjoys maintaining contact with Friends and Family!  Love my new Kindle and Love the Facebook app that I downloaded!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. I play it all the time. I just love how the minions are so cute. I love how the graphics are awesome.

B00136LVWQ|4.0|and thought it was a good album, but not as good as their first release.  However, I want to check other stuff by The Strokes.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|I think this app is fun,but it can be annoying sometimes! Maybe to make the app better you should make the app more kid friendly. Like,you should let them create their own record with stickers and colors after they record it.Other then that kind of stuff,it's a great,fun,app!
B003XQRZ0G|5.0|Definitely not the same as listening to the killers but it is a great alternative. Playing with Fire is the best song I definitely say its worth buying. Plus he is LDS, which makes the album that much better!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I cannot remember now how many times I have read this trilogy. But I've heard talk of a possible movie, I can't wait I just they find the right people to play Anastasia and Christian. I've heard talk of the guy from Vampire Diaries Damon being a candidate. I think that would be a good fit seeing as he is so HOT... Christian Grey kinda Hot. I'm just saying
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Challenging and fast moving. Like it a lot. Has many levels so it lasts quite a while. Excellent free game.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Got this book after hearing a podcast from Joe Rogan.  I've had goals that for years been too afraid to take seriously.  After reading this I've now decided to get serious.  It changed my whole perspective of \\"failure\\". Failure now means that I didn't even try, not trying and not making money.  There were lots of voids that got filled after reading this. It reminded me of how close I once was to truly pursuing my dreams but then gave up due to fear. I recommend this book to ANYONE with a dream. Even if you feel completely confident in yourself and your dream you're still going to come out a more informed artist, entrepreneur, writer and person having taken in all treasures this book has to offer. This will be a book I can always come back to when fear rears its ugly head again.
B00CVDM8QS|1.0|I own the hardback version and love it.  When I saw the \\"Bargain Price\\" paperback, I could not resist getting another copy.  What a disappointment.  This edition has no illustrations, even though the cover credits David Mckean with the illustrations.  There is no mention of the missing illustrations anywhere on the description of the book.  It is just a ripoff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is worth getting. It has many challenges and new things to unlock as you progress. It is so much fun!
B009AMANBA|2.0|Found this one long and pretty boring.If you are really interested in names and dates it might be interesting.Wont be watching it again.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun, got stuck a few times. Wish there was more levels. Very entertaining though. I thought it was going to be like 100 doors but it was much better and a lot more fun.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|I'm introducing my son to the world of Star Trek and we have been watching the original series and movies together. I remember original reviewers panning this movie when it came out but after watching it years later found it more enjoyable. Not a classic but even with the expected Kirk saves the people/planet/galaxy/universe ending was pretty enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great  time consuming game..love love insanely with the game can you escape really helps me to escape my everyday life. Can't wait to get home  and start my<br />Daily escape.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great show with interesting plots and fun characters.  Nice to watch on my own time sitting with my Kindle on my lap!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game with some very fun puzzles.  Graphics are nice. Told my friends about so they could play it! ! G5 did a great job with this game.-
B005HI4LMS|5.0|My husband and I never heard of this movie until we came across a \\"best movies you've never heard of\\" article and saw a 5 second clip.  That's all it took.  We were laughing so hard that we tracked down a copy of the movie that very night.  Then, we huddled in front of the screen and giggled, guffawed and snortled our way through this movie like a couple of goofy kids.  We even had to pause the movie a few times because we were laughing so hard.<br /><br />The horror genre has long since lost its charm for us, so this movie really made our night (okay - it made our whole week!)  It's clever without being too cute for it's own good and even the gory parts (which we usually don't have patience for) were forgivable.  It's a very well thought-out movie and excellently executed - um ... pun not intended ;-)  There was great attention in even the smallest details and we paused often to take it all in: newspaper clippings in the background, opposing characters dressed in outfits that were subtly similar, etc.  I highly recommend this movie for both horror fans and those who have \\"out-grown\\" the genre.
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|Horrible!  One of the very worst.  Men in Black I and II were good, but who wrote III ??  A terrible movie
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Must admit I was not familiar with this movie upon its release. A friend mentioned it and nearly fell out of his chair when I told him I had not seen it. Well we watched it on the spit and I had to seek a copy of my own. What an outstanding prequel to the best and longest running trilogy of all time!
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I liked the game, some times was a bit more difficult to locate the numbers, and it is addictive. The photos are nicely put.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A very interesting chronicle of the life of a man born in a North Korean labor camp, who escapes when he is an adult.  His story provides insigts into the daily life, deprevations, cruelty and lack of human dignity that is the life in these State sponsored camps.<br />Being one of only a very few that have escaped this existence, his story provides a look into his mental struggles to accept life in the free societies of the West.  His story shows his journey to  triumph over his beginnings, and underscores his courage and determinaton.  It also provides a look into the indelible mental consequences of such a beggining of life in the Camp.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|I loved the book. In my story of life as entrepreneur, I passed through different disciplines to accomplish my dreams and most of people look at me as wired. My family used to tell me, \\"why is that you are doing so many different things? are you making enough money? you went to the university, work as an employee and be normal!\\" After years of perseverance and currently accomplishing some visual results, now people find in my work what I've found years a go; I am in my element.<br /><br />I'm happy to share this book with other people who is looking for their Element and/or with people who are in charge of people, that rather than force them to cultivate a \\"normal life\\", are open to let them find what their Element is.<br /><br />I apologies for my English. If you read in spanish, I invite you to read at my blog about \\"The Element\\": [...]<br /><br />Thanks
B002OSY2T6|5.0|We bought this toy to try to make tummy time a bit more fun for our little girl.  It worked!  Putting this in front of her during tummy time made her laugh, a first for her.  She loves looking at the snail's face as it lights up and plays music.  I can't wait until she can crawl as I'm sure she will continue to have fun with this toy.  It's also a very durable toy.  Our two dogs have taken a liking to this toy and constantly push it around trying to get it to make noise.  It's quite entertaining and as long as they don't destroy it, we sit back and watch it because the baby absolutely gets a kick out of it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is the handiest software tool I have. I can move files between any of my devices, phones, tablets, desktops and laptops. I could not imagine being without it!!
B001I189MQ|5.0|Pretty good! Got to watch to and be thrilled by joker antiques. Watched it 3 times and still amazed by the acting.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|A book is good when you feel a compulsion to talk about it.  I did, I do.  Many things here to challenge and discover.  A worthwhile journey.
B005D63ICI|5.0|i loved it! Great show and can not wait to see more of the season! If you haven't watched..you should.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book was the topic of discussion at a clinic I attended.  I downloaded it to my Kindle and found it to be a quick and comfortable read.  It has revolutionized the way I teach and I get much better results from students.  It speaks to how the brain works, the importance of making mistakes in the learning process and shows just why those Brazilian soccer players are so hard to beat.  I highly recommend this book to anyone every chance I get.
B00006GA4C|5.0|Get rid of those jap surround systems and get a STEREO, with a PAIR of decent speakers, if you have to find some old JBL 3 way and have to have them rebuilt, do it. Having not heard this for a while it kicked my ass
0393320928|5.0|I try to give this book and another by Feynmann for high school graduates.  The anecdotes are wonderful (although sometimes quite technical) and full of good lessons about being true to oneself and enjoying the journey of life.
B000NY12CI|5.0|interesting and educational. really glad i read it. gives you a lot to think about and consider. definitely read it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love how this game drives me to continue! This really good for taking your mind off of other things!
B005544V6A|5.0|I ran across this show by accident and I love it. There is something for everyone. The Mike Ross character is really complex.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very thrilling keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would highly recommend it. Awesome action and great zombie scenes
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|For drama I give it 5 stars.<br />The comedy, which drew me to the show in the first season, however, is lacking, so I ended up rating it 3 stars.<br /><br />Bring back the dramedy!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great book my husband recommended it. It is a must read for science fiction fans!! It is good for young readers and the characters are deep enough and developed enough for more mature fans don't miss this one.
B002T3A4KW|5.0|Good HD and flawless feed. Using Roku there was no sound at first so the settings had to be changed from surround to stereo, however the sound was excellent.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It constantly beeps even when I turn the sound setting off and it freezes my kindle, so no, I don't like it.
0316247545|4.0|This truly is a necessary book for all fans of MLP: FIM; the commentary about the show and characters and such are the main reason. There's lots of great art, from the production stage and preproduction. Lauren Faust herself writes an introduction.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Preproduction/concept art<br />Commentary by the show's creators and those who worked on it<br />Sections on the characters and locations<br />Song lyrics- to every song in the show<br />A nice chapter at the end about the brony phenomenon, a nice acknowledgment of the adult fan community (of which I am a part)<br />The best MLP: FIM reference book out there<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fans of all ages know most of the info in here already<br />Not as much commentary or \\"making-of\\" information or concept/preproduction art as there should have been (or as I would have liked- that's why I got this, hoping to see lots of this sort of stuff)<br />Way too much room in here taken up by episode synopses (my biggest gripe; the information can be found on the net, and, again, fans already know the stories)<br />Should have been longer, more descriptive or analytical info on characters and locations<br /><br />In all, still an excellent reference book. A necessity and worth it for fans, but don't expect to find too much new information in here.
B00C3MKCIS|3.0|I was sort of underwhelmed. This is hyped a bit much. Too many songs sound similar. Maybe this should have been worked on the road first.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Hit Girl easily steals this movie.  Tons of gun fights, martial arts, and action.  Watching a preteen girl taking out scores of mafia goons is entertaining.  Rated R for bad language and some suggested sex.  Despite the young cast, this is not a kids movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its really fun to play but it needs more blocks every update it gets blocks that the pc minecraft has but its still fun get this because mojang created this app
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Despite the fact that this didn't end as a trilogy, I wasn't disappointed in the the story as some fans have been. Bottom line is I love the story of Gideon and Eva. I really don't care if the book goes on forever following them into their senior years, just let us know beforehand!
0060763280|5.0|I think this is a must read business book BUT in my opinion you should probably read it after you have read many of the other 'recommended' business books. Why? Well for me this book deals more with getting the right mind set, i.e. mental attitude. Sure, other business books mention having the 'right frame of mind' but I found this book to be somewhat different in its approach.<br /><br />That of course doesn't mean you can't just pick up the book and read it where ever you are in your business journey but I think you'll get more value out of it once you have some experience with the day to day of being an entrepreneur/small business owner. Again, the major for this is that to get the most from this book you need to have gone through a few of the trials and tribulations of starting/running a business. You need to have experienced the ups and down, the different people, the attitudes and so on.<br /><br />In essence I believe this is a book that you'll read, put on your shelf and keep coming back to it for information and inspiration, I know I will. The books is easy to read and contains a good deal of content that you can get your teeth into. Most importantly I found it was a book that challenged my thinking. It made me stop and discover more about how I perceived business and the journey going forward.<br /><br />Like I said at the beginning of this review, I think this book is really about developing the mental stage of success which not everyone maybe ready for. However, get it, read it and read it again and I'm pretty sure somewhere along the way you'll understand what I mean.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Like the game.  It's fun to play and keeps your attention to detail trying to find the numbers.  Would recommend.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Have always loved Sookie and the gang but I am really happy after reading this book! I don't want to give anything away but I'm over the moon with the ending and extremely thrilled for Sookie! Great book. Thanks CH!!!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Nothing like I expected it to be. boring reading and nothing like the movie.  I wanted to read book first but now I wish I'd seen the movie first.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I don't know if this ever came to the cinemas here - if it did I missed it. My UK friends raved about it so i was determined to get it on DVD. I was not dissapointed. I loved it. Quality cast, quality acting and quality direction. All very understated. Superb.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am a big fan of the Edwardian era...so for me he clothes in the first season was simply fabulous. Now we are looking at post war era 1920's style and the characters along with the fashion move along with time.<br /><br />I found myself living, loving and laughing with the characters...one feels almost a part of the drama.....FREE BATES!!!!! yeah!
B000005RPX|5.0|It was great when I found the bootlegs that went into making Deep Purple's Made In Japan.  Then I found the official releases and their recording quality is great and it is interesting hearing the alternate versions.  Especially interesting are the variations that the band did for the songs that ended up on Made In Japan.  They really ended up picking the best versions out of the three shows for the official release, but this is really good.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I was really surprised on how good this movie was. I am not a huge MMA fan but do enjoy it enough although you don't need to be a fan of MMA because the story is great!
B00BC0JI6O|3.0|I've always like Spock's Beard and their take on prog was usually very interesting.  I was kind of disappointed in this album.  There are a few good cuts, but too much of it sounds like they phoned it in or were trying to sound like another band.  Sometimes they sound like they are recycling Yes, Kansas, Toto, and any number of bands from the 70's and 80s.
B002SGYPS2|3.0|Not Carrey's greatest flick but still pretty good. I really like the general idea of the movie. Would watch again.
B00CA4S27W|3.0|Blackmore's Night churns out pretty good renaissance music if that is your thing.  You half expect to see a bunch of Hobbits and Dwarves whooping it up listening to this stuff.  I wish Ritchie would go back to rocking.  His tribute to Jon Lord on this disc is nice though -- sounds more like Rainbow than it does like Blackmore's Night.
B001D09OAI|4.0|This movie can still make me laugh. I was pretty young when it came out but I still really enjoy it.
0345404475|5.0|Fantastically written, I will be looking for more Philip Dick books after reading. I loved the setting of the story, and the plot twists that the characters were engaged in.
159463176X|5.0|The Book was great! I would highly recommend it for anyone who is searching for a good read.  Especially if they've already read A Thousand Splendid Suns or The Kite Runner.
0553386794|5.0|It starts alittle slow, it needs to introduce a lot of characters, but it is amazingly written, it has all the great elements of story telling. Once I got into the book I could not put it down. I skipped work and school to finish this book
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Too many ads attached to the screen.  Also, can't really see the names of the towns.  When I enlarge it, it goes back down almost immediately.  I am a new user of the smart phone, so maybe it is operator error.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It's an amazing series and I'm loving all the twists and turns that the characters are taking. Martin puts so much work and detail into each of the characters you really feel like you are there with them.<br /><br />I read the books before I watched the HBO show and can't wait to finish the series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was late to view this series, but boy is it great! I loved the story line and can't wait for the next seoson. I wish I did not have to pay so much however.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|This is a very nice android rdp app controls work very well on my galaxy note 10.1. My compliments on the nice gui. especially love the scroll button.<br /><br />unfortunately it doesn't support linux pc's. Almost all my pc's run linux, I hope they will add support for it in the near future.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Crazy good. So well written, so entertaining, so twisted. A fabulous read!!!!! Does make you wonder about the author:-) buy it today!!!!
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|I was ready to watch this movie and had no sound. I tried a different video and it was fine. I just tried again from home and I still had no sound.
B00002DE4E|1.0|Closer is a very good album, and contains many of Joy Division's best songs. However, the version listed as Closer [import] is an unacceptably flawed pressing. Every single song skips in intervals of seconds, and there is massive static distortion throughout. I have received two pristine copies, one from the original order, and one replacement, and both had the exact same problem. As of writing this review, I am in the process of trying to get yet a third copy of the album, but I have absolutely no doubt that the problem will persist. Amazon's shocking lack of quality control on this particular listing is what I find most annoying.
B004LROMWU|1.0|hello<br />I purchased this as a fan of scifi<br />made it thru about the first disk and hallway thru the second and found myself fast forwarding it, as it is a sad commentary for such a well know director as Spielberg.<br />the acting and story line are awful, I see them cancel stargate continuum and keep stuff like this? and I am depressed by what scifi has come to I mean even the old lost in space is better than this!<br /><br />Buyer beware this is C grade scifi....
0800177363|3.0|so I was a bit disappointed in that..<br />the movie is great as I use it for teaching<br />my students were frustrated due to the subtitles.<br />I would not buy from this company again as I feel I was mislead on the product
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I read this book at the suggestion of a friend.  I knew about Christopher Hitchens but not up close.  This book helped me to see the personal features of atheism.  It wasn't just a notion but someone's real story.
0345529057|5.0|Love these books. Really glad I was able to get them as a set. I had them all once before and they burned in a fire
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Although I like Schwarznegger's acting, (usually) this attempt left me wanting, The script was predictable from the beginning and I think I've seen it before in a Gunsmoke episode, or maybe it was the Rifleman! Anyway I give it a 3 for effort.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I have found most Harlequin books to be enjoyable.  This one is also very enjoyable, entertaining, & witty.  Didn't want to put it down.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Another great book by the best author of all time. Loved this book because it gave a great insight into the lives of half bloods.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|This movie is the epitome of film noir and very entertaining. It is an absolute must see for all movie watchers!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|_hard to get points but is really cool with fun games I'm doing this reveiw for points so I can afford more games
0439023513|2.0|I was very dissapointed in this book and I thought the first two books were so much better. I think that in the beginning was not that much happening and maybe because of that the author had to squeeze all the action together in the end so when the action finally came it was a total mess. I also felt like Katniss was very depressed through the book which is understandable in her circumstances but it just made me depressed to. Some times I also thought that the storyline and the plot were just all over the place.<br />The book was not all that bad but in the end it really let me down and I thought it was the worst book in the series for sure which is shame because I really liked the others.
B000FC1MOQ|1.0|You can't get much worse than This.  Sentence fragments don't make for good writing.  But maybe repeating yourself over and over again does?  Repeating yourself.  Repeating myself.  Repeating Yourself repeating Myself.  Now I'm a Good Writer.  Good Writing apparently requires Awkward caps and cheesy poetic line breaks according to Frey.  Maybe if I<br />Begin a New line then<br />My writing will be better like James Frey's?<br /><br />This Guy is just trying too hard.  Not only is the story outrageously untrue and sold as nonfiction, it's written terribly.<br /><br />Purchased this because my book club wanted to read something controversial.  If you want controversial literature, read Lolita.  That's literature.  This book is total Crap with a capital C like Frey likes it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's kinda hard, but pretty challenging and fun. Highly recommend this game for people who need to waste time enjoy a good challenge.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took me a long time to get into it. I finished it only because my book club was reviewing it

B007MB5OCE|5.0|It was very funny and a most enjoyable read.  The play Funny Money is based on the same theme. The play is an English comedy.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new app is cluttered and difficult to &quot;see.&quot;  Maps of doplar are small.  Difficult  (impossible) to remove a location from the device.  I find I use it less with the new format.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We had been hearing about the Downton Abbey Series and decided to check it out. By the 3rd episode of the first season, we were hooked.  Season 2 and 3 are progressively more and more engaging. If you decide to watch the series, be aware that this is very, very British. It will take your American ears a few episodes to get used to the accents..<br /><br />The series shows the lives and transitions of English gentry  (an earl and his family) and those that work for them. It starts in the early 1900s- as time marches on, the viewer will see the transition into the 1920s in dress and values. Fascinating series!! Highly recommended
B0025KVLT2|3.0|Rubber Soul was one of my all time favorite Beatles albums.  I ordered it and &#34;I've Just Seen A Face&#34; is not on the CD.  What's that about?

B005LAIIJY|4.0|Great movie and funny but quite a liberal use of the &#34;N&#34; word, if that offends you, you may want to avoid it, my friends like it and I did too.
B0090P98Z4|1.0|Dont waste your time or money. This game lures you in with good game play and then when you get to a certain point its programed to make sure you keep losing until you spend money in the game. I know that there's allot of these types of games for the kindle. Never have I seen one so blatant. At least most of them have a way for you to proceed slowly through the game if you choose not to spend money. Not this one your controls start locking up and it ignores your commands until you spend money. Bad play GLU I know your running a business but that is low, really low.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game and I hope they make another one. and I hope that everyone who sees this will download this game

1416987118|5.0|This book is one of those books you can pick up and read over and over again! As children become more familiar with it they love to say the words right along with you- making it a new experience each time you read it. The kids love to move and wiggle along with the rhythm. Great for their imaginations as they relate to these common experiences, but see it in a new light of adventure. Guaranteed to be loved by every child! A must read!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging  rooms lead to the next fun and challenging room. And so on and so on. How stupid is it that there's a minimum word requirement on this review.....
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|There are already many comments on the excellent performance of this processor, I can repeat it, but the truth is that all are right, those who purchase this processor is not going to go wrong, the performance per core is amazing, definitely recommend it to everyone, for gaming and multitasking is best.

B004QL7K70|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0<br /><br /> Every year just about, a movie comes out of nowhere, that is actually quite clever and funny. Three teenagers, Thomas, Costa and JB, plan a humongous birthday party for Thomas, at his parents' home, after they split for the weekend. Before the parents leave, Thomas reassures his father that he'll keep the house in good order as there will be only a few kids coming over to celebrate his birthday.<br /><br />We learn that Thomas' father is disappointed in his son in general, as he's not very popular at school. In contrast to the hesitant Thomas, Costa is the bad-ass friend whose main goal is to get laid. As he says later on, \\"Tonight is about the girls we never had a shot at\\" and the party is the opportunity to \\"change the game.\\" Costa continually eggs his conservative friend on, urging him at every turn to embrace his inner wild side. Rounding out the trio, is their nerdy, overweight kid, JB, who also seeks sexual freedom.<br /><br />A fourth confederate, Dax, an AV student, follows Thomas, Costa and JB around, videotaping all the events with a hand-held camera. Other footage is shot during the film with smart phones, police dashboard cameras as well as by the news media, which plays a prominent role during the film's climax.<br /><br />Before the break into the Second Act, when the big party begins, there's some important foreshadowing going on. The three friends pay a visit to Costa's marijuana dealer, T-rick, a military vet, who sells them some weed for the party. Costa ends up stealing a Santa Claus gnome, a figurine that later is revealed to contain hundreds of pills of Ecstasy. The theft of the gnome sets T-Rick off later on, with near deadly consequences. At this juncture, T-Rick is seen chasing the hapless trio, as they make a getaway in Thomas' father's car; the vet manages to break the car window, foreshadowing some real crazy things to come.<br /><br />Since the three friends want to achieve popularity amongst their peers, they advertise their big event on social media, with disastrous consequences. Before they know it, about fifteen hundred to two thousand teenagers populate Thomas' backyard (soon the orgy spills into the house itself, earlier proclaimed off limits by Thomas' father).<br /><br />The three must then cope with an escalating series of crises which all have unexpected results. An initial crisis involves Thomas' pet pooch, who the drunken revelers hoist into the air, tethered to a bunch of helium balloons. Thomas lowers his dog down from the air and averts the first crisis. Then a neighbor comes by and threatens to call the police because of the noise. One of Costa's very young 'security guards', tasers a neighbor 'who doth protest too much' and then ends up getting slugged himself by the angry protester. In another great twist (and there are many of them here) Costa averts another crisis by threatening to report the neighbor for slugging his 'security' (a minor).<br /><br />As teenage girls strip off their blouses and bras and swim nude in the swimming pool, Thomas is tested by Alexis, 'the hottest girl' in the high school, as she French kisses him as they both down shots of Tequila (the seduction foreshadows the discovery later on by Thomas' girlfriend Kirby, of Thomas about to have sex with Alexis).<br /><br />When the police arrive, Thomas and his friends manage to get everyone to quiet down in the backyard. The police want to search around but Costa smartly reminds them they have no warrant. Later, Thomas is depressed by the wanton destruction going on outside and Costa tries to relax him by giving him an Ecstasy pill, recovered from T-Rick's (now shattered) gnome.<br /><br />Now completely high, Thomas is hardly in a position to try and keep things under control. His ego is stroked when all the party goers sing happy birthday to him. Meanwhile events are set in motion, leading to things getting totally out of control. A dwarf is thrown into a dryer and after Costa saves him, he repays everyone by striking them hard in the testicles. Later the dwarf returns and promptly drives Thomas' father's car into the swimming pool in the backyard.<br /><br />The second act crisis reaches its apex when T-Rick appears with a flamethrower, torching Thomas' parents' house and the rest of the neighborhood. For a few minutes, the comic tone of the movie is lost and I'm not convinced that the flamethrower scenes with all the kids running for their lives and police firing rubber bullets, enhanced the overall spectacle. In other words, it got a little 'too real'. Nonetheless, the way in which the news media is depicted covering the event, was a nice satiric touch.<br /><br />'Project X' manages to re-introduce the comic tone when Thomas' father both berates and praises him for the riotous goings-on the night before. Besides lamenting how much all this is going to cost him to repair, the father also is impressed that Thomas has made himself popular. In a great touch, the father makes Thomas drive to school in the burnt out mini-van. But Thomas finds redemption from both his schoolmates who cheer him in the hallway and Kirby, who forgives him for his indiscretion with Alexis.<br /><br />Finally, we find out that the legal consequences for the hapless trio are not so bad after all. And the party becomes fodder for even Jimmy Kimmel, who jokes about it on nighttime network TV.<br /><br />'Project X' is successful because all of its unexpected twists and turns. It's a clever concept which manages to sustain itself until the end, when it slightly wears out its welcome. The three principal actors were discovered after a nationwide casting call. Since they didn't know each other before, the producers brilliantly sent them on a week Disney vacation, where they presumably bonded.

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a fun, well done movie with excellent special effects.  Interesting plot and I just love all of the &#34;good guys and girl&#34;.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|The girl on the cover has an AK-47. Which went into service in 1947 - well after this novel is set. So I didn't have high expectations. Nevertheless I was disappointed. Ian Fleming's career was really quite interesting. This novel was not. Cardboard characters and a pretty dull plotline made it a bit of a chore to read.<br /><br />Fortunately there were the anachronisms to keep me interested. A 'military' novel whose author thinks the Police Positive revolver had a safety catch? Lancasters in 1940? Recon jets overhead? MG42 'submachineguns'? German soldiers armed with Gewehr 43s in 1940?<br /><br />I lost the will to live during the speedboat chase. The villain turns a Sexton howitzer on Bond... err, Fleming. The Sexton wasn't invented at that time and... and oh yeah, it's an armoured vehicle. And she also has a SiG 33 on her boat. That's a 150mm artillery piece. Presumably the speedboat came complete with a half-dozen crew?<br /><br />Seriously, this thing is awful. My cat can write better.

I have spent 100's of hours playing.<br /><br />Multiplayer only works locally. 2015 is supposed to have online multiplater.<br /><br />If you remove the game it will delete all your progress so don't remove it unless you are not going to play anymore.<br /><br />If you want to change  your name then just remove the app and re install. You will lose all your progress though.<br /><br />I see a lot of negative reviews here and after looking through all of them they have one thing in common. They are trying to play Magic 2014 on a device that can't play the game. If you have a Kindle Fire HD or better you can play this game. The game requires 3gb of storage to play. It downloads 1.5gb and then it opens up to 3gb. If you don't have at least 3gb's of storage available then don't download this app.<br /><br />If you're upset about your device not being able to play Magic 2014 then go complain to whoever made your device.

B00CL8D83U|5.0|This is a great, fresh effort from what is my personal favorite group of all time.  As a PSB super-fan, my expectations have been high, especially due to the association with Stuart Price (this guy is a genius as far as I'm concerned!).  I only assigned 3 of 5 stars for their last album, Elysium, although in hindsight there were some great tracks that were deserving of a better rating (was more of a 7 out of 10).  Their new album I am assigning a 5 star review; it really is a solid 9 out of 10 but I will round up this time.<br /><br />To sum up the content, overall it is quite dancy and a bit techno/ trancy.  It almost feels like an album composed entirely of dance remixes.  There are not any slow \\"whiny\\" songs, although these sometimes turn out to be the real gems on an album after a few listens.  I will be enjoying this album for the rest of the summer, head nodding and finger tapping, but time will tell if it is a classic worth revisiting in future years.  The length feels a bit short at only 9 tracks, especially since Axis is basically just a musical track that I have listened to many times since they released the video online.  I would have liked to have seen a second disk or bonus disk with more tracks, because the PSBs with Stuart Price combination is a machine that is capable of incredible musical feats.  Also, just a minor gripe, but I felt like they altered Neil Tennant's voice on some of the tracks to sound like he is speaking through an old AM radio; that is fine and works as an occasional device, but I would have much preferred to hear more of his pure voice.<br /><br />On to the tracks:<br />1. Axis - Mostly electronic music, almost zero vocals, excellent and complex beats and synths.  Again, I have been playing this for the last few months since they released the video, and love the track.<br />2. Bolshy - A classic PSB sound, and not a bad listen.  However, the repeated word \\"Bolshy\\" gets a little bit tired after hearing it for the 80th time.  Although it is one of my least favorites, it still keeps me smiling and enjoying the music.<br />3. Love is a Bourgeois Construct - My favorite track on the album; A+!  A classic PSB type of anthem, full of musical and lyrical complexity.  It envokes \\"British\\" images and themes, and keeps the beats going with some similarity to the fantastic album Confessions on a Dance Floor (Madonna / Stuart Price).<br />4. Flourescent - Another nice techno-synth-heavy track.  A bit harder hitting than your typical PSB track, but a strong addition for the album.<br />5. Inside a Dream - Complex beats and synths again rule this track.  It feels like a PSB song, with Neil's voice taking command.  Classic stuff, and a great track.<br />6. The Last to Die - This is the cover of the Bruce Springsteen song, which I was not previously familiar with.  This excellent track shows the range of the PSBs and their ability to pull in music from unlikely sources.  Outstanding musical quality, vocals, and beats make this another favorite.<br />7. Shouting in the Evening - Possibly the most energetic track on the album, it is lacking in vocals but is as hard hitting as any electronic music this side of Skillrex!  Again, not your classic PSB track, but this one will definitely be on my MP3 list for working out.<br />8. Thursday - A great track, which is another favorite after a few listens.  Chris Lowe's vocals add lots to this; although it is mostly a pronouncement of \\"Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\\", the dry style is absolutely reminiscent of the style of their old track Paninaro.  I don't particularly care for the rap segment (British rapper Example), but it actually works pretty well and adds some nice variety to the album.<br />9. Vocal - Neil's vocals power the intro, and then excellent club dance beats kick in.  An outstanding track and a great way to cap off the album on a strong note (or two!).<br /><br />For the die-hard PSB fans this is a no-brainer.  For anyone who is looking for some great danceable pop music that is a cut above the rest, give this a shot.  For anyone reading this, I also would recommend checking out Empire of the Sun's incredible new album, Ice on the Dune; this entire album is upbeat and would definitely appeal to those who like traditional PSB content.  But first buy Electric, and support the PSBs as they prove that they are still a vibrant and relevant force in the synthpop world.  Overall an excellent album, and is highly recommended!at danceable pop music that is a cut above the rest, give this a shot.

Jason Segel is equally wonderful as Gru's main evil villain competition who is a child nerd in a grown-up body.

Finely written, with a personal, gripping point of view that makes it impossible to put down.  You must know what happens next.  You must define your own instincts regarding the outcome.  You must prepare yourself for the twists and emotional conundrums of this very fine story.

Finally up and downloaded it to my Galaxy4.<br /><br />This is a good book, imo.<br /><br />I REALLY connected with the characters. I held out hope for Holton until he died.  I teared up a bit when Jahns died.  I was sad when some of the main characters were killed during the uprising.<br />I really liked Juliette.  The unlikely hero.<br /><br />... and it says a lot when you can find redeemable qualities in a villain, too.  Bernard had layers. LOL<br />To me, Bernard wasn't a bad guy. Probably had an inclination for unethical behavior but who knows?  I'd like to think that plenty of people would find themselves making those same hard choices if lives were on the line.<br />Still, I wonder why he ran from her and the security of the blanket?<br /><br />I'm really interested in how the silo will operate under the new truth vision but I'm probably going to buy the prequel next.  I want to know why the govt destroyed the world.

B00CDUVDEC|4.0|The first solo album from Phil Anselmo sees him returning to the extreme vocal style he employed during the \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" period of Pantera and his subsequent band, Superjoint Ritual.  As a fan of that stuff, it's good to hear Phil screaming and yelling again.  I like Down, but even their first album from 1995 had a lot more screaming and aggression from Phil than their later albums.  It seems like he just couldn't resist the urge to release some pent-up anger in a way that wouldn't fit the vibe of Down, but this time simply under his own name.  I read an interview where he said that he wasn't starting a new chapter with this solo venture, but writing a whole new book.  I guess we'll see if the music stands up to that, or if it ends up being a short story.<br /><br />If Phil puts his mind and will towards it, I think he can make a go of it solo.  This album, unorthodox and offputting as it is to some, has some destructively heavy songs on it.  While some of it is reminiscent of Pantera, and some of Superjoint, it mostly belongs in its own category.  It's sort of like grindcore, but without constant blast beats, and with touches of groove.  There's also a hint of death metal.  I don't know if the average Pantera fan would be into it, but I think Superjoint fans would have no problem enjoying it.<br /><br />I can't quite give it a five, as it's no masterpiece or future legendary debut.  It's almost an A effort, and would be if the songs had a bit more cohesiveness.  Sometimes they seem disjointed and tough to distinguish from one another.  I'm sure with more listens and familiarity, I'll get used to it more.  I think Phil accomplished what he wanted, and that was to deliver a crushing metal album that would defy categorization.  It has a lot of promise, and I'd like to see Phil build on it for an even better follow-up.

When John Carter came out, with eye-catching CGI special effects... we just had to give it a shot.  We are VERY GLAD we did!<br /><br />When the movie ended, we couldn't figure out why it had been given such bad reviews...it was a real head-scratcher. (This isn't a film for small children)<br /><br />WATCH THE MOVIE ... YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!  Like able characters, enchanting storyline, the CGI, makeup and costumes are FABULOUS!
0060987464|5.0|This is the greatest autobiography I've ever read. It has the life story of one of my favorite musicians and carries a lot of progress on the first three albums by his infamous group of the same name, Marilyn Manson. Manson does not fail to deliver every bit you expect him to, with dark stories, twisted humor, and a couple of really weird trips. The book isn't really work safe, and definitely not child-safe. Loved it.
B001I10ABE|5.0|What I've noticed in most Amazon.com reviews is that they review the album and not the actual product and/or vice versa. So, I'm going to do both.<br /><br />The Album:<br /><br />Metallica's self titled album was both a hit and miss for people everywhere. It was a hit in the idea that Metallica took their thrash metal to a more mainstream level attracting the mainstream audience (aka the radio) and a miss in the idea that metalheads were disappointed by the album for the very reason of going mainstream. While it is a much more mainstream album than the others, especially coming off of their 88 album ...And Justice for All, it still holds up as a metal album in my perspective. It's not nearly as heavy as their famous 86 album Master of Puppets, but I feel in this album they didn't completely let go of their past albums. A perfect example is the song Holier than Thou. That's a very heavy song and one of my personal favorites. So metalheads need to  stop whining about the album and whine about something worth whining about (Load and Reload).<br /><br />The Actual Product<br /><br />180-gram 45 RPM Vinyl never sounded so good and goes perfectly with the Black Album because of how, back when producing the album, the new producer Bob Rock spent extra time and $$ to get the album sounding as perfect as possible. With this vinyl set, that shows. I have read reviews that some songs skip, but after a sweep through all of the songs i haven't encountered one skip on my box set. The songs sound crystal clear, the drum track in perticular sounds like Lars Ulrich is right in the room. The bass is also outstanding and it shows on the song Sad but True.<br /><br />All in all for $30 this was a steal. I finally have a reason to use my turntable again and when friends are over it's a great idea to play this album during a round of pool (yeah, I have a mancave in my basement). People considering buying this album on vinyl, IT'S WORTH IT.
B001QERPDO|5.0|This album is great, I love the songs. The Script is a great band all their songs are amazing, and i highly recommend all their albums. (The Script, Science and Faith, and #3)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There was a game like this online alike 10 years ago and I was so addicted but i beat it. I am so happy to find this.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|The  music in this soundtrack is great. I am really glad i purchase this item, it has great songs with amazing  lyrics. The Script is an amazing band i can't stop listening to all their albums.
B009RH973I|4.0|I think this product is great for the price and products my Kindle well.  I wish it rotated but that really doesn't matter.  I love the strap makes me feel like it is secure in my pocketbook.  Works as a protector!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The only reason I got this game is b/c my tween son was bugging me about it for his birthday and it has a rating for his age group.  Even though it is not my cup of tea he loves it and is always telling me how far he is on it & how many deadly viruses he has.  Yay.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This show is very slick and mesmerizing from the beginning. You see that Harvey Specter is a hot shot lawyer and why he is so valued by the firm. Mike Ross is an interesting character as well that continues to develop through the season. The cast of characters at the firm are entertaining as well especially the bully and enforcer of the office, Louis Litt.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game, it's very fun and very affordable. But I would rather get Minecraft online, because of<br />-no boats, lava, etc.<br /><br />-no mods, skins, etc<br /><br />-no changing from creative to survival..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. I have been enjoying playing it and it works well on my kindle fire.
B000002WYT|3.0|It is not the CD that was desribed in the editorial review - I am very disappointed with it, and it even has some of the sound completly cutting out at the end of the CD.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this app is pretty simple and not to complicated it can use some adjustments but its agood app.its also handy if you want to know the percentage of your battery.
B000002OX7|5.0|The sound quality and clarity are fantastic.  I would highly recommend it ti anyone! I really don't know what else I can say.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I would highly recommend season 1 of American Horror Story, it kept me interested the whole time, it was also nice not having to wait for the next episode.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super cool and fun it shows you how to use your brain cool nothing can beet it not even an Xbox love it not to bad and then it is to cool and may or may not be rocky it is kinda ready but I finished it in 30 min
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Its amazing really...control your computer from your phone...also streams the computer screen to your phone. You can even stream your computer audio to your phone. It crashes once in a while but other than that its great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game walks you through many rooms..each one chock full of items..numbers..and codes you must collect. Entertaining without being too hard.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The end of a series of books can never be as good as the early books imo.  They have to wrap things up and can't introduce any new gripping issues.  This book did the series justice and was a fun read.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Great video. So sad about Cory Monteith. Will treasure his songs forever. Got to my house in good amount of time.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Just like his other books, Ocean at the end of the lane is an interesting, fun read.  Only wish it had been longer :)
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is amazing. The Percy Jackson series is 1 of the best series EVER.<br />Rick Riordan is an amazing writer I love his work.<br />I hope u read this book u won't regret it.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|His musical genius can't be disputed and listening to his music is relaxing and most enjoyable.  I'll continue to buy his CDs!
B0073V7YTY|5.0|I didn't expect much.  Many of the apps that I try on my Archos Android tablet were intended for smart phones and either don't work, or work poorly.<br />This was a pleasant surprise!  I expected a meter that displayed real-time readings.  I was very pleased that this not only shows peaks, but a rolling graph with the last 30 seconds of display.  I'm fairly experienced in analyzing sound levels.  I haven't compared this with a quality instrument yet, but using sounds that I do know, the app displays values that I expect.<br /><br />A great app!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Addicting. Once you get started with one puzzle you don't what to put it down, want to work on the subsequent puzzles
B003F9G8B8|3.0|Liked this well enough. No the greatest movie ever but an interesting perspective on the history of South Africa and Mandela's legacy.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Inventive &#34;car&#34; chase.  Spy type plot twist.  All the gun fights are fatigueing. Seven more words required.  Seven more words requied.
006114665X|5.0|I join others in applauding the scholarship of this volume. But, as some have suggested, there is a gap in the explanation of the role of Germany, and in particular that of Bethmann Hollweg. Is it possible that the chancellor's role can be explained by his rather slavish devotion to the volatile moods of the Kaiser? When the Kaiser was initially bellicose, so was Bethmann Hollweg, although Falkenhayn testifies that the Kaiser's bellicosity was tempered by the professed need to secure an alliance with Bulgaria in order to outflank Serbia. Then, as the crisis wore on and the danger of the failure of the localization strategy increased, the Kaiser became more circumspect, apparently believing that the Serbian response to Austria's ultimatum removed all reason for war. Correspondingly, Bethmann Hollweg grew more pacific. Then, after reading, or mis-reading, the Tsar's last telegram, Wilhelm once again became apoplectic, and Bethmann Hollweg apparently and, to many inexplicably, relaxed his all-too-belated pressure on Berchtold to consider mediation. Did the chancellor have an independent opinion? Perhaps he really felt that in a major European war, Germany had a chance, if England could be induced to remain neutral. But, of course, the politically astute knew that England would never desert France.<br />Sanford Rose
B008XG1X18|5.0|so easy to use on the kindle fire hd! i just keep finding more things to use it for, and now i can use pinterest on it... when i can get it away from my 14 yr old!<br />easy to use app, second  best to using it on the desktop. i like it on my motorola electrify m too. i love pinterest!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved this app until the new version came out last week. To many videos and ads. It is actually hard on the eyes with the background that is now behind the numbers. I just want to see the weather. The older version was more user friendly.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|If you didn't take Tom Hardy seriously yet, you should start. And if you think the tag lines on the box about it being the 21st Century &#34;Clockwork Orange&#34; are a bunch of BS, prepare to eat crow. That's all I really want to give up. Check out the story on the real Charlie Bronson too.
B0016OOS16|5.0|Pros:<br />- very responsive<br />- small and compact<br />- easy to adjust settings and sensitivity<br />- good program support<br />- Travel pouch<br /><br />Cons:<br />- needs more weight (since this is the travel edition more weight seems counter-intuitive, but actually it is useful so the puck-like device doesn't slide on the surface which makes controlling it more difficult). The Desktop version of this has a larger base for more static use.<br /><br />I have had this 3D Navigator for over a year now, and it works extremely well. I do some work with 3D animation on the side, and it makes navigating 3D space a lot more intuitive, especially if you want a more controlled pan around objects than the hotkeys in programs like Autodesk Maya can support.<br />It also seems to work well with many programs I have tried, including Maya, Google Earth, Blender, 3Ds Max, and some other software that can take multidimensional input.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who does 3D work and needs to take it with them. For a desk-only usage scenario, I'd go for the desktop version since it has a bigger base which means more control and less slippage.
B0083Z3O8Y|1.0|The book was incomplete, it started in chapter 25 therefore I could not read it. Maybe I'll try to get it again in the future, is one of the classics I would like to read sometime
B00164KYV4|5.0|E! has been playing this movie a lot lately and I always catch it toward the end. Have seen it several times tho and just love it so I finally decided to buy it.
0307949486|5.0|This book was a gift to my son.  He loves to read and I did not want to pay full price.  I have never bought anything from Amazon before and loved how easy it was to buy on Amazon.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am a long time fan of Nelson DeMille and absolutely love his oft-used character John Corey who is featured in this novel along with his new wife and partner.  Character Corey's continuously caustic remarks made me laugh out loud a number of times in quiet settings which drew a number of amused glances.<br /><br />But the book is not one dimensional with Mr. Corey at it's center.  It presents a great story of efforts, not too long after 9/11, of counter terrorism personnel in - what would John call it - \\"exotic\\" Yemen.  Start with DeMille's Night Fall and you will want to read each John Corey novel and probably the remainder of Mr. DeMille's novels as well.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome!!!!! a great book so far. And of course the book is better than the movie. I highly recommnend this set.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very interesting and imaginative story if you can handle imagining children as virtual soldiers. I was surprised by the ending.
0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages explains everything in detail about how people interact among different love languages and how they communicate.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book was an easy read. The time flew by. It kept my interest from start to finish. I will read the other books in this series.
0765365278|5.0|This guy is a wonderful author - well developed characters, great plot lines, original concepts - I heartily recommend any of his works, and I can't wait for book 2 of the Stormlight Archive!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I downloaded this and it won't open, crashes each time I try! Sure wish I could have gotten it to work... disappointed!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Every variation of the Robin Hood tale has included changing societal attitudes and values. This is the best version for me because it connects Robin Hood to the Magna Carta, which later inspired the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. What Robin steals from the rich and powerful (even though his attempt is delayed...again), is basic human rights. Yes, the Magna Carta was an agreement between barons and the king...but it provided an opening for yeomen to become a \\"middle\\" class. There must be a place between those who have everything and those who have nothing. If no such place exists, there will be revolution.<br /><br />The legend of Robin Hood is important because of the spirit of balance and freedom in human society. Those who rule (by decree or capital) cannot be allowed to take everything and leave everyone else to starve under forced labor. That is an important message for me because the struggle continues today.<br /><br />This old combat veteran salutes everyone involved in this project for the clarity of vision it represents. Every generation must learn about freedom. This is an amazing tool for doing so in a painless and entertaining manner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to tune in, but I caught up 3 seasons pretty quick!  Yes mi'lady, it is a lovely show.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love the actors, and the intensity, I love watching.  Wish I could get to see it more.  I think its expensive for my means.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Absolutely the best campy, cross dressing, gender bending, mind blowing, rock and roll movie ever!! Who can resist doing the 'Time Warp'!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Some of my friends, mostly the Techie ones, had said this was a very good show.<br /><br />When I was laid off for a while, and so had a chance to spend some time online, I decided to see what Amazon Prime had to offer in the way of downloadable entertainment; Firefly popped up, and I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Very glad that I did - it's excellent, and it was such fun to see some familiar faces: Nathan Filion (I've been a Castle fan since the beginning) and Ron Glass (of Barney Miller fame).<br /><br />I'm planning to watch the remaining episodes as time permits ... :-)
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|It seemed like an interesting movie, and we enjoyed parts of it- but for whatever reason ther was a window that continually popped up stating that there was a 'download error'. This was even the second time I had to rent this movie as the first rental did the exact same thing. Pretty dissapointed in the service, and still have not been able to watch the entire movie.
B000V674JI|4.0|This is an enjoyable album, if you like Coltrane.  I've enjoyed listening to it, though I haven't listened to it often.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Most of the characters since book 1 slave to sensation have come full circle and you get the heart of the series in this book.  It's truly intense and leaves you with a bit of a mixed pensive but exciting mood.  It can probably serve as a stand alone book but to experience the full flavor and depth of it I recommend reading the entire series.  The characters do grow on you. I look forward to what's gonna happen next to the fall of silence.
B002CGPI3O|4.0|This is an enjoyable album, if you like Moby.  I've enjoyed listening to it, though I haven't listened to it often.
B001MUSQ80|5.0|The book was brand new but it took almost 2 weeks to get to me, which is my only complaint
B00280LYHS|5.0|I like this book it had the best fighting ......and i like the part when percy jumps into the river Styx...but im sad its over
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game if u really love horses<br />And the graphics are great I love it and u will too
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Continuously receive a message saying &quot;there was a problem parsing the package&quot; when the update tries to install.  This has been the case for months!  Does the developer pay any attention to these reviews?
0744014549|5.0|This book is very beautiful and has a ton of stuff in it, characters, props, scenery, beautiful digital art, etc. Only wish it had a bit  of the ingame collectable props displayed. Other than that.. amazing and highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my 8yr old grandson is so much better then me.  love it!!!!!  keeps us both busy for a long time and good quality time.
0393330435|4.0|Here is an interesting story about Stephen Gary Wozniak who is essentially a brilliant and creative self taught electronics/software engineer.The biography walks you through his childhood discussing the impact his father had on him which led Stephen to become more involved with electronics and computers. This is followed up by a series of successes Stephen had as a child demonstrating how  truly  gifted he is. The most fascinating parts come when Stephen goes into detail about building the Apple I and then the Apple II. Here the reader learns about how these two products really shaped the way we compute to this day. With that said, it was the create \\"Woz\\" that made Apple, not Jobs. Steve Jobs had no part in the creativity and engineering involved in the Apple II. We learn a little about some of the key players in the founding and growth of Apple, but for the most part it focuses on what each chapter of Wozniak's life was like. Overall if you're like reading about fascinating scientist and engineers this is a great book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Recently I have been reading a lot of the \\"new adult\\" genre, and most of it is has been okay.  However, this story was so well told that I had to give it the highest review.<br /><br />Let's just start with Holder.  Wow, I loved him.  He was a great book boyfriend.  From the way he was sarcastic, to the whole \\"best non-first kiss\\" ever, to the way he just loved her.  Everything about him was perfect.  He was everything I would want in a book boyfriend.  And wow, I really can't say enough about that best first non-kiss scene.  Fantastic.<br /><br />Then there is Sky.  She was great.  I really appreciate when the heroine of the story is not some annoying, whiny brat.  I hate when the heroine makes a bunch of bad decisions (or the hero) that just make me want to punch them in the face.  And I really, really hate any form of a love triangle.  I don't want to read about someone who can't make up their mind about who they love.  So I was very pleased that Sky was none of those things.  She was sassy, smart, brave and above all she never made me want to smack her or throw the book down.  I really enjoyed her.<br /><br />And then there were the best friends, Six and Breckin.  Loved them both.  Every female should have a wonderful gay best friend!<br /><br />Overall, this was a great book that I would highly recommend to anyone.
0061730335|5.0|This book, and the man who wrote it, are amazing.<br />It starts off a little slow, with stories of magic from William's childhood, but just read on. It gets really good!<br /><br />We learn about the horrible famine that affects Malawi, and the extreme poverty that these villages must endure. It's so eye-opening, because it is all so recent (early 2000's). In such a modern age, there are still people living so primitively. It's interesting to see how a famine can occur, and how the government turned it's back on it's own people. And so sad- such silly things are so hyped in the American news. I don't remember this Malawian famine ever being in our news, and when I tried to look up articles about it, there was barely anything! And yet so many people suffered!<br /><br />Anyways, the boy and narrator, William, is so smart. When he talks about taking apart radios just to see how they worked, it reminded me of Richard Feynman, the brilliant physicist, who also took apart radios in his childhood! There are so many things we use on a daily basis and we have no idea how they work, and no interest in finding out. The most interesting part of the book is how William uses the text books from the library to figure out how to make a windmill (there are no step-by-step instructions for building a windmill, he just figures it out), and then improvises using the trash and scraps around the village. This boy is so smart, brave, and motivated. He is also a wonderful writer. It was so inspiring to read this, and I really recommend it!
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I returned the case because I did not like how the kindle was held in place. Also the on and off feature did not work correctly
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I got to level 6 and after an hour I gave up.  No instructions &amp; no clues.  I uninstalled and gave up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|FUN! There is so much fun packed into 1 game!  It's addictive and exciting. I can't put it away. I stay up all night playing this...
B0053KWDES|5.0|Good product, brings my sony xba3 alive.<br />Really good for the price, I'm sure there's better and more expensive solutions but you can't beat this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun for an afternoon took some time but not hard to figure out if you work a little
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|It was another of Bruce Willis' &#34;I can't believe he didn't die 50 times&#34; movies, but the scenes were good and the action was great..
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It was just so darn funny and &#34;relate-able&#34;.  Tina Fey doing the narrative just makes it that much better.  I highly recommend this as required reading for any of her fans or fan wannabes.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is by far the best book in this trilogy. Gone is all the insecurity and petty fights and finally Gideon and Eva reach a point in their relationship that is satisfying to themselves and to the reader.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I found myself thinking about the book even when I wasn't reading it anymore.  A definite must read for science fiction.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I had to start over after having a problem with connecting to the server after an update and there is no way to log into my User. overall a great app! I just wish there was a way to use a previous User.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Eight-year-old son bought. Absolutely loved it. Volkswagen fans need to purchase ...fast delivery , best price<br />... I would definitely recommend
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I tried to download a YouTube App to watch videos but I couldn't find a good YouTube App in the Amazon App Store, so I downloaded this App. You won't be able to watch a lot of the videos you want to watch. Specially the official videos. You can watch some videos, but most of the time you won't be able to watch the ones you want to see.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I purchased this game, along with the 3 dice expansion to the game, and I have not been at all disappointed with the purchase. The game is quick, fun, and easily learn-able in a single turn of play. Even without the expansion, which adds a great deal of situational amusement, the game puts you very much in the zombie mindset as you roll dice to determine whether you have caught your victim and consumed their tasty, tasty brains, let them slip through your grasp only to be pursued next roll, or if they have decided that they are in fact on the top of the food chain and turned their shotguns against you.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I recently purchased a 2009 Infiniti G37x which has the factory stereo and iPod adapter that won't charge newer iPods and iPhones.  This adapter works perfectly with the system and allows me to charge my iPhone 4S while listening to audio.

B0095MVOMC|5.0|finished all the levels in a couple of days.  The game was very addictive.  I highly recommend this to everyone.
B0000549B0|5.0|Makes you reflect on your life, while totally enjoying the story and acting.  And of course, Jimmy Stewart is the best!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Extremely happy, thank you this is a very good movie, i have watched it many times, thank you again, very happy!!
B0024FA9IM|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  It is captivating with both humor and drama.  I can't help but imagine what it would be like to be in their situation; scary!
B0000DZTIL|5.0|Very good, thankyou this movie I have been looking for, for a long time, it was great when I found the movie. Thank you!!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I have played then all at least once.  It is so much fun.  I need new ones, since I have mastered the others.  Great fun!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|good game for kids and adults. addictive and wont be able to stop. makes you want to collect bananas for the minion costumes.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it stops working everytime i try to play something, tried to play some HD videos and a message popped telling the app closed
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Loved the trilogy. It made me think a lot about not judging others for the way they look and the impact the media has on everything. Didn't know Sweden was so corrupt!!
0345529057|3.0|Captivating, but by the time I read through 2/3 of the second book, reading became plodding and I was sick of all the killing. I kept on because I wanted to know what happened to the children of Winterfell and their wolves. Too long, too many characters, too violent.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|With having to load and reload, turn on and off the safety and fire selector (on the sub-machine guns) this app is very realistic. I also belive the app is accurate as to the location and function of the levers and buttons on the weapons. Good Job.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Considering how many people like this movie, it is hard for me or anyone ales to say something that hasn't already been said. So I'll keep this review short and simple.<br /><br />Lincoln is my role model so seeing him come to life meant a lot to me. In a weird way, it provided escapism. The movie isn't 100% historically accurate. Lincoln freed the slaves for other reasons besides the obvious morality issue. However, I think it is safe to say this is about as accurate as Hollywood is ever going to get.<br /><br />The bonus features are good but they feel identical. The only major difference is that each feature covers a different aspect of the film. Either way, I would have rather seen one big making of documentary than a bunch of short one. Aside from that, the bonus features are enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Since I bought it used, the Digital Copy didn't came with the code needed. The two Blu-ray disc worked well and Lincoln is a movie I would rather enjoy on a big screen so I don't really care about the Digital Copy and I didn't expect a used copy to have it. The only reason why I'm mentioning it is to give people a fair warning. I also don't know if the DVD copy works. To be honest I only got the 4 Disc version for the special features.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love the easy listening while I work! Wide variety of music choices/genres. Love it! And I love thAt the station's are from all over.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys return in less of a year since their last release \\"Elysium\\" and come back with a punch to your dancing gut called \\"Electric\\". At 9 tracks this is a short but substantive in dance beats PSB album. This is the Pet Shop Boys finest entry to dance music since \\"Nightlife\\". All the beats on \\"Electric\\" are heavy and the lyrics are reminiscent of late nights and early mornings doing walks of shame. PSB deliver hard beats and melody to a disco beat.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  I only started watching it because I got Prime membership, now I am hooked!  I am really impression how well written and jammed packed with details each episode is.  I actually learned a lot more about WWI, right before my son had WWI in school.
B00B6U63ZE|5.0|I had read the first book and being an executive coach is was helpful but this second one explains much better the questions that I need to ask my clients to go deeper in the experience.<br />Also liked the 5th element.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love this movie to pieces, it came unopened, brand new and way faster than expected. No complaints at all.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Wasn't sure about this movie when I started watching it but by the middle of the movie it had me totally sucked in.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|I don't like games when you have to buy credits to play and advance in the game. This game is not for me.
B001EN71CW|5.0|&#34;If wishes were horses, we'd all be eating steak...&#34; Great quality blu-ray, love it! Let's bring it on back folks! Netflix exclusive maybe?
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|UNO was fun when it was just UNO but now it is even better. I recommend this to everyone, especially those who like playing UNO.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Personally i own this video and its one of the best cult Horror classic .still to date whatching this with friends on a good surround theater gives me hair tingling moments.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|You have more than 20 noises and sounds like: flute, night, and ocean! I loved it and. It did help calm me down
B00999DFP0|5.0|This show is absolutely awesome!  The humor and scientific fact that goes into each episode is great.  I can highly recommend this show to anyone, whether you are nerd or a moron...
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I used to be an air hockey fanatic.  I loved the game.  This incarnation of air hockey caused me to lose hours of time.  Not bad for a tablet game.  The sounds are life like and the colors ( with the sprites ) add another layer of coolness.<br />If your a air hockey fan, this game is great fun.
B00932A4XE|5.0|Never trust movie critics! I thought this movie was so cute. I don't have kids and never been pregnant, but I still found it entertaining. Funny, with some serious moments, but I would definitely watch again.
B008133MDK|4.0|I actually watched Season 1 and Season 2 back to back over 2 days' time.  This is probably not the way it was intended to be seen. That being said, I enjoyed season 2 more than Season 1.  The only episode I didn't enjoy at all was the second one, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles, ' which in my opinion, was truly terrible.  They were trying for a completely non-supernatural, modern-science update of the classic Sherlock Holmes story, and it just didn't come off.  Not even watching Sherlock have an emotional freak-out moment could save this episode....it was more disturbing than revealing, a waste of a good Benedict Cumberbatch performance (now that's criminal!) Watson was wasted there also, and that's doubly bad, because the Watson in this update of Sherlock Holmes' adventures is far more interesting, much more of a partner.  I was getting truly tired of having it repeatedly shown that Watson's lovelife is awful, thanks in part to his association with Sherlock, in that episode.  But enough of Episode 2.  In Season 2 we also find out a lot more about Mycroft Holmes, who's more complex and interesting, than I could have imagined Mycroft to be. That was a pleasant surprise.  We meet him again in Episode 1 and in 3.  The third episode was very difficult to watch, very intense, very well done....except for the end, which was completely predictable.  The first episode, 'A Scandal in Belgravia', was really good, except for the end (again!), which was IMHO, just stupid.  I liked the twist on Irene Adler's character (forgive the pun), and I love plot elements that are different/fresh/innovative, so this one was definitely fun to watch.  But I just hate it when the end isn't as interesting as the beginning, because that's what keeps you coming back.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch, love Martin Freeman, love the great partner chemistry, love the whole concept of an updated Sherlock.  I hope Season 3 is a cut above the first 2 because my patience is running out.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Can't wait for another one to come out :) Good for the ladies too, lots of good looking men in this movie.
B00499QUK2|4.0|There's a lot to like about Sherlock.  A LOT.  A REALLY LOT.  I wanted to love it; that's the charm of the characters, the actors, the performances, the freshness of the update.  But the plotting and execution of the episodes didn't match up with the expectations created by everything else.  The first episode, 'A Case of Pink,' started out excellently and really was great in every way-- a capital launch-- but the exposition at the end was predictable and a let-down, IMHO.  The second episode, 'The Blind Banker,' was a serious failure.  It could have been interesting but turned into an overboiled soup of silly Asian stereotypes, unimaginative denouemont and just plain dumb writing.  I don't know how this mess got off the storyboard.  The third episode, however, more than made up for the shortcomings of the second. We get introduced to Moriarty, and he is more than worth waiting for, because not only is he as brilliant as Holmes, he's also a good deal more psychopathic.  Sherlock is quickly out of his depth-- and knows it.  In the first episode Sherlock says he's a high-functioning sociopath but it quickly becomes clear that this isn't true, and by the end of the third episode, Sherlock is beginning to know it isn't true either.  Nothing ike a true sociopath in full on serial-killer-mode to make it clear who the fraud is, and as we will discover in Season 2, Sherlock lives in fear of being shown to be a fraud.  It's okay that I didn't love it, because I definitely liked it enough to hope that Season 2 would be better, and expected to keep watching.  I was sure the series would improve over time and application, because there's so much to work with.  It's worth your time.  Please watch.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have been blown away by this story. It took less than two days to read because it becomes an addiction to read chapter after chapter. Such an amazing heart wrenching story. I've already told at least 20 people about it. A must read, absolutely.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Reminds me of a mashup of the following flicks:  \\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"Drag Me To Hell,\\" \\"Carrie,\\" \\"Cabin Fever\\" and \\"The Ring,\\" with a little bit of \\"127 Hours\\" thrown in to boot.  But this film takes the best of those movies while not making the common mistake of going off the rails by mocking them.  \\"Evil Dead\\" is surely one hell of a ride.<br /><br />I reviewed \\"Cabin in the Woods\\" a while back, a film that I borderline hated and took a lot of heat because of it.  I thought that that film catered to an immature crowd, while this film catered to more of a mature-and-true-horror-film-loving audience.  These films can be tricky; they either work or they don't.  And even though this is more of a straight horror flick than that other more satirical movie, this one worked for me while that one did not.<br /><br />CITW winked at the audience just a little too much, and it also seemed to take itself way too seriously, thinking that it was something far more than what it was.  That type of position can truly backfire and it really did in that case.  In contrast, \\"Evil Dead\\" seemed to take what other horror films have learned from the past and expound on that learning; it is scary but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have it's funny moments.  In that sense it reminded me of \\"Drag Me to Hell,\\" a film that was really sharp.  But the special effects are really good as well and never come off as being cheesy.<br /><br />What's the theme, or rather the moral, of the story?  Just like the female lead, who gives a very sharp performance, I would also say, \\"Let sleeping dogs lie.\\"  But don't let this film lie around in your Wish List for too long.  Rather, a pretty big recommendation on a viewing, as soon as possible.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|this however is not even catchy. its just some angry narcissist ranting over a synthesizer. Check out Rittz if you want new, excellent talent.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|My boys love the mix of colors and animals! Is there any other way to teach colors? We love Brown bear!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is a great app. I use it every night to go to sleep. It has so many sounds to help you fall asleep. It is definitely worth the purchase price. I would recommend this to all my friends.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I always liked Hitchcock's older stuff, before he got obsessed with violence. NxNW is obviously of its era. The whole mix up starts with the arrival of a telegram, but the movie holds up well. It's still full of suspense, some dry comedy and a bit of romance. Cary Grant plays the innocent man thrown into the deep end of a pool where there's a mean game of water polo being played. Eva Marie Saint plays a typical Hitchcock heroine, a woman with a past who is maybe in a bit deeper than she expected. NxNW is a real tour of its times, from Madison Avenue, to stately Jay Gatsby country, to Chicago, to South Dakota and the Mount Rushmore monument. I'm not giving anything away. You've probably seen some of the now legendary scenes on Youtube. So, give NxNW a try. There are no neckties, killer birds or shower stabbing scenes. It's good clean fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game. It's so exciting jumping over the trains and running away from the guard. You don't know if he is going to catch you or not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think its better than temple run or subway surfers because there's movies to go with it so great game
B00BMQDM10|3.0|very light reading.  Funny in the beginning but you can guess what is going to happen. Not to happy with it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush is a great game.  If you love any of the Temple Run style games you will love Minion Rush!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|These little guys are just so cute and its so much fun to play. Graphics are good but I like the gameplay and its also a great game for my little youngsters.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|great special effects, cute story line...good spin on an old tale...enjoyed this and think it would be fun for the family!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a game at first I thought I wouldn't like it but as I played it and played it it becomes addicting it is good for all ages
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book 5 in a song of ice and fire...utterly amazing...I cannot wait for 6..then i won't be able to wait for book 7...the battle between light and dark...fire and ice...is well underway.  I haven't enjoyed reading so much since the lord of the rings was new to me...keep at it George!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once I started I read until my Kindle dropped into the bed, me finally asleep. There is something about authors in the Middle East and Asia Minor regions. They tell good old fashioned stories. I cared about every character, all of whom are accounted for at the end. There is tragedy as families are parted. Afghanistan and the cultures there are described and made real as the nation and its peoples watch their beloved country over run by foreign invaders and internecine fighting. This book would make a great miniseries.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I literally could not put this book down...it was stuck to my hands!  Characters I care about, an interesting story line, and the promise of more books to come!  I fortunately did not discover this until the HBO series was out...so i could read the books as soon as i finished them...I'm now rereading this story after finishing all 5 books and just love it...Jon Snow and Tyrion meet for the first time...Bran climbing the tower walls again...the direwolf pups...I just love this stuff, even the second time round!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Very enjoyable read. I did figure out the mystery pretty early on, but it was still interesting to watch it unravel. The character development was great. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that there were a few too many loose ends - characters like Linus who were developed but then didn't really have a crisis moment or tie in to the current story.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I became addicted to the HBO series and waffled on reading the books... I was dying to know what was coming but I didn't want to ruin the suspense of the excellent TV show. I finally broke down and bought this set after Season 3 ended. I've only finished the first book but I was amazed by how faithful HBO's adaptation is.
0446573027|3.0|I am a fan of David Baldacci, however this was not his best effort. The beginning and middle were strong, but somewhere towards the last third of the book, he lost me. I dislike when authors start revealing crucial things that happened while you were right there with the character, but that the author deliberately chose to keep secret. The wrap up of the story made me wonder if the main character had all this figured out earlier on, why did we have to bother with the later chapters? Also, some of the actions taken by the characters don't seem to align with what we know about them. For example, the author says that the side of the main character's iPod had been honed to the razor sharpness of a Ka-Bar knife??? Who does that? I get that the guy is military, and kind of a badass, but he's a CID investigator, not an assassin.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Got this app when it was free and it has not disappointed. I have seen great battery improvement on my Toshiba thrive. Would re omens to any one
0151013837|5.0|This Deluxe Illustrated Edition was worth the extra money and the extra wait time to get. It's a weighty, quality bound hardcover with amazing illustrated plates, reminding me of the way books used to be created back in the day. If you are interested in this story, I highly recommend trying your best to get your hands on this particular edition. It's very worth it and would make a fine addition to any serious bookshelf.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I am very satisfied with this item. It's brand new and a perfect gift for Minion lovers! Thank you so much for this item!
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|LOVE this album, it is so different and unique.  The sounds are great, unusual and really appealing.  I would recommend this album.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Works great on Kindle fire HD, If you're a Uno fan download the app. Still learning how to use app but so far easy to figure out. I would suggest a chat option in this game.
1572814748|5.0|I have small hands and tendonitis in my thumbs, making it difficult to shuffle most decks. This deck is the perfect solution for me. First, the size of the deck is perfect for my small hands. The other feature I like is that the cards lack the stiff glossy finish of other decks, which makes them more pliable.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|LOVED it :) Such a fantastic show. Can't wait for more to come out! Harvey is my favorite for sure
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I found the first 100 pages very interesting.  The next 50-60 very difficult to read but they made the last 100 pages inspiring.  What a wonderful tale of ingenuity, intelligence, perseverance and hope.<br /><br />Great read.
B007CGLRWA|4.0|The film beautifully shot and directed by Tony Kaye. A few times the movie had me thinking, is it really that bad? Sometimes it seemed a little over dramatic but overall I enjoyed the film very much.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing! Read for hours straight, took me 5 days to read it, Same with the first one, now I must read the last one
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love it so far. I play BF3 and Black Ops and it works really well. I have precision control for those head shots so what more do you need.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I plan on watcjing it again, just to see if I can watch it a lil more relazed the 2nd time
B000002PCS|5.0|I love this Soundtrack of a movie that was so beautiful.  I listen to it often and always enjoy the music
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Progressive, fun, challenging, Definitely recommend it,  Great graphics, fast, perfect as it's not a timed game.  Definitely one of my current favorites.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|THIS NEW APP.  IS AMAZING IT IS GREAT AND EASY TO USE. EVERYONE SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM USING IT.
B00COQTZLS|3.0|I use an iPhone and iPad and would love a reliable, comprehensive calendar/contacts/notes/todo app.  I have tried many and over the past few years have repeatedly tried Pocket Informant on and off.  Each time I attempt to force myself to make every effort to stick with it but PI is a little more demanding that I felt I received commensurate value for.  I also have an Amazon Kindle Fire HD for which I purchased this version of the PI app.  I used PI 2 with fair results but PI 3 lost me and I reluctantly gave up falling back to the native Kindle Calendar and Contacts apps with Catch as a ToDo and Note.  I wish the Kindle would get into this decade.  No Dropbox app, no GoodReader app, no SimpleNote app, and very few Google support apps.  I love reading the books on Kindle, especially with Audiobooks &#34;immersed&#34; into the e-book so you can listen to the book being ready while you read it on the screen but the lack of common apps and services is very disappointing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game love the big minion that<br />destroys everthing#1.do you want a good game its DESPICABLLE ME:MINION RUSH.#1 GAME EVER AWESOME
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This is a tear jerker to say the least! I will continue to watch this over and over again .
B003YOWU1Q|4.0|I just heard his music last week.  Now, I cannot get enough of him.  That is rare for me.  Something I haven't done for about 6-8 years is, I bought this CD.  He had several different sounds with different rhythm's and I appreciate all of them.<br /><br />Thanks Ray.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am always looking for a program that is far away from the Reality Garbage ~ It's more like Let's Pretend It's Real ~  The Good Wife, although somewhat predictable, is closer to Real.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is extremely helpful in planning all your outdoor activities . . . When to snow mobile, swim, boat, planting schedule for your garden, hunt, bicycle, motorcycle, hike.  Love the hourly breakdown of temp and precipitation! Could use a move in placement of the &quot;play&quot; button on map feature for the android  as it interferes with the &quot;return&quot; bottom. I recommend this to everyone!
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|This album does not dissapoint. It is reminiscent of other Joe albums where every track is a must listen.<br />Joe does it again!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Maggie Smith is amazing and so are all the very talented musicians in this film! Definitely a renter for anyone!
B0007TKNII|2.0|same as othet two - will only play on my laptop not on the DVD player and large screen which is what I was expecting
B003RV43X4|1.0|The special effects can be given a slight approving nod, but otherwise, I'm sorry to say that this film is weak.  Actually....it's just plain lame.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For me this is the Ultimate pack of the great Dark Knight Trilogy (The one that is coming don't bring anything stunning in my opinion) all the movies in blu ray format with a lot of extra content and a mini version of the book The making of the Dark Knight trilogy.<br />what are you waiting for? click add to the cart!!
B001NLCBJI|4.0|Bill Murray does a good job of capturing his role of disaffected American pitchman in Japan.  Although he at times appears to be just going through the motions, he nonetheless conveys the movie director's (Sophia Coppola) intent.  Although (naturally) not up to Bill's intrinsic comedic talent, Scarlett Johansson does an even better job of capturing the mood.
B00441E2R8|5.0|This is a nice watch! I just love it, looks great with casual clothes.<br />It arrived really early and in perfect conditions! Just as usual when i buy something from Amazon!
B001OFJPIS|2.0|Cool character and special effects.  Not the most robust story-line, but who the hell(boy) cares!  Definitely worth watching Ron Perlman reprise the role.
161655164X|5.0|I finished this great game (In fact this is in my all-life great games i've played top 5) so i started looking for something else, i found the Post pandemic edition of the game but it's a little expensive, then i found the comic books but i just want to wait till they come in a hardcover edition... and finally i found this!<br />The art of The Last Of Us is such a great book! Big, hardcovered, with a lot of detailes a nice ilustrations! And for a low price!<br />You miss Ellie and Joel? This is the book you're looking for!
B00005N6KG|4.0|For the price these headphones are much better than I expected. They feel very breakable, but so far so good! They stayed in my ears perfectly while running. I bought them mostly to listen to audiobooks on my runs.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|All the four movies! in a great book-look-a-like presentation! and an extra blu ray full of bonus content!<br />Indy as you never seen him before!
B0058YPGL6|4.0|i got this on time. i am kinda obsessed with teen wolf. but when i open the envelop the case was kinda broken. i looked at the DVDs and there was nothing wrong with it. so i really didnt care about the case as much as i do for the DVDs
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|Good show. Used to watch it when I was a kid and now it's even better with the new technologies out.
B00DW2PDH8|4.0|The prose is poetic and beautiful. The flow of the story takes the reader on the terrifying, disorienting and thrilling journey of Delicate Rose. She is running for her life without even knowing who she is and as the mystery is revealed to the reader we see the root of her terror and how it all began. The book is so much more than a vampire novel. It is a story of tragedy, true love, madness and debauchery. Luna Sanguis is well worth your time and I recommend it as a read for the vampire lover, but also anyone who loves a great mystery. I love when authors step outside the box and it works this well. Simon has stepped outside the vampire genre box and with Luna Sanguis he's doing victory laps.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If your looking for a challenging game, this is it.  It makes you think just what all you have to do to open that door.  Some stuff is just there to throw you off. Some is obvious. And some are not even in your thoughts.  Just try everything.  It could be the least obvious.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|The writing came off as a bit pretentious to me - the constant allusions to 'Jane Eyre' and other classics came across as the writer comparing her work to those, a little bit irritating.<br /><br />The story itself is good and I don't mean to say that the writing is bad. It's a well structured frame story and I think it's a great book club selection because there is clearly lots of symbolism, foreshadowing, other literary devices, and parallels between the frame and the story inside. So hopefully there will be lots to talk about at this burgeoning book club that I've just joined.<br /><br />This quote beautifully echoes why I prefer contemporary literature with open endings. It is not something I could have put into words this eloquently.<br /><br />&#34;He has described in precise, measured words the beautiful desolation he feels at the close of novels where the message is that there is no end to human suffering, only endurance. He has spoken of endings that are muted, but which echo longer in the memory than louder, more explosive denouements.&#34;<br /><br />Setterfield, Diane (2006-09-12). The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel (Kindle Locations 472-474). Atria Books. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />BABY SPOILER:<br /><br />This novel has a nice neat ending and does not suggest the eternal suffering of man.<br /><br />All the same, it's worth a try.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|LOVE this film wish they would make John Carter 2 have actually watched it numerous times its a fun action film Excellent would highly recommend it
B00AB55BS0|5.0|If you want to lose a weekend, just start watching this.  I kept telling myself “one more episode”…..  This was so well done – great story, costumes, locations and acting.  Showing several storylines in different locations simultaneously  keep you current on all the doings that you know are going to collide on a spectacular burst.  That it all flows together so seamlessly is a credit to all involved.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|A good film if you like the first Sherlock Holmes you will not be disappointed liked the story line and narration action pack
B0056BU3I2|3.0|It's entertaining, Some of the stunts are ridiculous though. The cars couldn't be faker either. Decent movie though. Would recommend as a decent action movie, though there are better options out there.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I Loved this movie ....  Having been involved in music growing up this movie brought back a lot of fun memories.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book truly captures you. The Book Thief pulls you into a world where words can do anything. Death as the narrator allows you to feel as though you are looking in on the life of the book thief while experiencing her life first hand--a truly amazing tale!

B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Enjoyed watching on the train.  It was entertaining until the end.  Some adult content so not fir the kiddies. Enjoy!

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My family and I took Suits Season 2 down to our lake house along with Season 1.  On a very rainy day we started our DVDs, made some snacks, got a coke and enjoyed watching Suits all day.  Fun!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game is very addictive but enjoyable. I find it more challenging the further I make it. I would recommend this game
B00DW36G32|4.0|Good moral play on eye for eye-who benefits from avenge? What can it do for ones own soul? There is an ultimate authority in the universe thus peace cannot be attained via violence.
0525478817|2.0|I didn't like reading this book I found it hard to get into and I am an book reader so will choose more carefully next time

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you really have to concentrate! I love all the codes and combinations you have to crack! Can't wait for more levels!
B00DU74U74|2.0|I'll start by saying, I have not read this book.  I read a bit of Twilight once and almost threw up when I thought about the amount of money this \\"author\\" has made with some of the worst writing in history (only thing worse is 50 Shades of Gray, but I digress...).  So my opinions are solely based on the movie.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for The Host, I was really excited (again, not knowing it was written by Ms Twilight).  I've been wishing for an intelligent sci-fi movie that doesn't have hours of explosions or slime eating someone.  I assumed the film would explore the nature of a world taken over by aliens, hopefully present an ethical discussion of peaceful aliens who \\"steal\\" the bodies of a species that has been at constant war for thousands of years and is in the process of destroying the planet it lives on.<br /><br />*MINOR spoilers ahead*<br /><br />What I got, instead, was sappy nonsense with no real sense of danger, no tension, nothing. I found the whole \\"internal dialogue\\" between Wanda and What's Her Face (I cared so little, I seriously cannot even remember her name right now) really annoying, and it did absolutely nothing to make me care AT ALL about the girl who's body was taken. In fact, I think a huge problem with this whole movie was that the aliens were far more pleasant and reasonable than the humans, and the lack of any real ethical discussion or exploration of WHY it would even be a negative for these aliens to stop humanity from killing each other left and right meant that the film was unable to develop any real argument as to why the aliens should be fought at all.<br /><br />I had serious issues with the fact that there was literally no tension whatsoever in the plot.  I kept waiting for *something* to happen, but aside from a few slaps for Wanderer by the humans, pretty much nothing happens this entire movie.  We're supposed to care about the \\"romance\\" between Wanda/Other Girl and the 2 love interests, but the relationships here areas juvenile and tiresome as those in the Twilight movies.  Just a bunch of 19 year olds \\"madly in love\\" with each other who just keep kissing - and this is supposed to show the depth of their emotion.  *sigh*<br /><br />And without saying specifically what the ending IS, I will say that it was the sappiest, most feel-good nonsense I've seen in a while.  It reminds me of those old episodes of Fantasy Island where someone would fall in love with someone in their fantasy and then run into a \\"stranger\\" who looked just like them afterward!! How convenient!<br /><br />Maybe the real problem we have is that our culture is so youth-obsessed, it's impossible to get a really strong sci-fi movie anymore.  Because everything has to have these teenagers in it all the time, and so everything turns into this soap-opera garbage romance.  So sick of it.
1419701533|5.0|Grandson loved this series. Well written, and kept his attention throughout the series. Would recommend these books.1-10 scale =7.5. great comprehension builder.

B003AWRM9W|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It's just fun. You can tell that everyone involved had a great time making it. The story is what it is and the acting could be better .. but it could also be way worse. It is just one of those movies i always have laying around when I can't decide what to watch. I have a handful of these types of movies, but this one always seems to come to the top. It has everything, comedy, action, adventure, romance (kinda) .. and Clint Eastwood in a Gold Blazer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absotutely positively Love love love this game! :D the picture quality it's pretty good, and the game itself is really easy. Definitely for all ages.although, one downfall is, is that it doesn't really have a plot...

B00CL8D83U|5.0|Electric is the Pet Shop Boys first release since their break with Parlophone, the label they have been with for pretty much forever. It is also the follow-up to the relatively sedate Elysium (2012). Electric is really the flip-side of Elysium - high energy dance electronica as opposed to the somberness of Elysium. Chris Lowe is quoted on Stereogum as describing the Elysium v Electric dynamic as: \\"[Elysium] was about being old and all that... whereas [Electric] is all about rediscovering your youth.\\" Many of the tunes on Electric were reportedly written simultaneously with the songs on Elysium and while some folks are calling this a \\"return to form\\" record, contrasting somber albums with high energy ones is not new for PSB; compare, for example, Introspective (1988) with its follow-up Behaviour (1990).  Producer Stuart Price brings a freshness and vitality to the classic PSB sound on Electric, while the Boys bring a maturity that can only come from 30 years in the business.<br /><br />Although Electric consists of only nine tracks, these are long tracks, with the majority clocking in at well over 5 minutes and three over 6 minutes.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a bang with the \\"electric energy\\" of the first single, \\"Axis.\\" This largely instrumental tune is techno dance and has a classic PSB sound. It's fantastic and I imagine most PSB fans are already familiar with it.<br /><br />Track 2, \\"Bolshy,\\" is another very electronic song which sounds as though it could have been lifted from Bilingual (1996), while the intro hearkens back to the synth in \\"The Way it Used to Be\\" from Yes (2009). It has a nice tempo and I could see it getting some club play, at least in clubs where they still play PSB. The lyrics are weak by PSB standards, loosely referencing Marxist Bolsheviks, but are catchy nonetheless.<br /><br />You know the third track is a PSB tune from the title alone, \\"Love is a Bourgeois Construct.\\" The lyric is reportedly based on \\"Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds\\" from Michael Nyman's score for the 1982 film The Draughtsman's Contract.<br /><br />\\"Fluorescent\\" is a slow-trance 80s house sounding tune characterized by an \\"airhorn\\" like synth. Reportedly it was the last song written for Electric.<br /><br />\\"Inside a Dream\\" is one of the less memorable tracks on the album, in my opinion, though it is nice to hear some vocals by Chris, especially after his silence on Elysium.<br /><br />\\"The Last to Die\\" is a slower track and, unusually for PSB, a cover of a Bruce Springsteen tune (from 2007's Magic). It sounds a lot like a Killers tune, as interpreted by PSB, of course.<br /><br />\\"Shouting in the Evening\\" is the shortest track on the albums and is a very dance-oriented buzzy electronic tune which is largely instrumental. It has a nice, slowed down synth section in the middle before driving back up to a frantic, Skrillex-like conclusion. Incidentally, \\"shouting in the evening\\" has often referred to acting or performing on stage.<br /><br />\\"Thursday\\" is one of the best tracks on the album, including a great vocal by Neil and excellent backup by Chris, much like his contribution to \\"Paninaro.\\" The song is also reminiscent of their first hit, \\"West End Girls.\\" Example provides a rap at about 3:30 into the track which meshes perfectly with the rest of the song. This should definitely be single #3!<br /><br />The album is bookended by singles; the second, \\"Vocal,\\" is the closer. It begins with a hypnotic lyric by Neil which segues into a rave-like tune.<br /><br />In summary, in the modern parlance I'd say this album is \\"bangin!'\\" It really is an excellent PSB album and much more what you'd expect from the Boys than what was found on Elysium. I can't recommend it enough. Finally, if you're one of those people who usually hold out for the release of the PSB 2 disc special editions (as I am), word has it that there will not be such a release for Electric, so go ahead and buy it already!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves this movie. I also think its a pretty cute movie too. Fun to watch. My daughter loves the thought of monsters now.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love this game.  It is so addicting. I like that it forces you to be observant and think outside the norm to find the numbers.<br /><br />definetly recomend it!!!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Well written, was hard to put the book down. Not the typical ending which I didn't like but that's just me, I like a little predictability
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|One of the best movies I've watched this year. Denzel Washignton played the part very well, and the film did a good job focusing on alcohol abuse and the distress it causes to everyone around the abuser. Worth every dollar.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie is wonderfully presented. It tackles a touchy subject that is part of our history using great humor. Love that the hero is given a chance to change his destination when presented with an opportunity.  Also loving the great display of positive black love as this is usually not exhibited in movies today. Tarantino rocks!!
B005544V6A|4.0|It's like House, but for lawyers! These guys are the best lawyers in town, they always get away with stuff and their egos are extremely high! Very fun to watch.
B003VANOFY|5.0|PROS:<br />-Nice sound<br />-Nice isolation<br />-Beautifoul design<br />-Excellent microphone<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The headset batteries could be 2xAAA to be replaced when finish. Buts its ok.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My first Vince Flynn book and it was a page turner.  Could not put it down.  While a fiction, it does give you real insight into the mess that is Afghanistan and Pakistan and why, perhaps, in the real world, it is not possible for any type of normal peace or good outcome from our policies.  This book would make a great movie!!
1594746036|4.0|I liked this because it was an imanginary, different type of novel.  A bit on the &#34;too  unbelievable&#34; side, but interesting.  It was even more &#34;way out&#34; than a Stephen King novel.  The photos made up for it though.

B000IDEORY|5.0|The film is about Frances Houseman (Jennifer Grey), nicknamed Baby, a pretty middle-class teen-ager who finds her adult identity in her first love affair - with Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the hotel's dance instructor. For a girl of Baby's conventionally liberal, Jewish background (she's planning to study ''third world economics'' in college), Johnny, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks, exemplifies the freedom expressed through a new and as yet socially unacceptable form of dancing. This ''dirty dancing,'' a phrase used only in the film's title, features a lot of steamy body contact and pelvic thrusts, which unleash emotions supposedly left withered by mambos and cha-cha-chas.<br /><br />Taking a formula that is itself creaky of joint and infirm of body, Eleanor Bergstein, the writer, and Emile Ardolino, the director, have made an engaging pop-movie romance of somewhat more substance than one usually finds in summer movies designed for the young.<br /><br />I suspect that one's responses to ''Dirty Dancing,'' to its period details, even to its state of mind, will depend on the associations one brings into the theater. What is undeniable, however, is a basic decency of feeling, shaped, in part, by the film's obligations to its optimistic genre.<br /><br />Baby, as written by Miss Bergstein and played by Miss Grey (''Ferris Bueller's Day Off''), is no bubble-brained teen-ager, but a bright, inquisitive young woman who's on her way to being her own person. Miss Bergstein is much better on creating character than in re-imagining formula events. Baby's liberation comes through her forbidden association with the womanizing Johnny Castle, after his partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), becomes pregnant and Baby agrees to substitute for her in a mambo demonstration at another hotel.<br /><br />There's a really quite awful subplot about Penny's abortion, financed by money that Baby has borrowed from her conventionally liberal doctor-father, and about the arrogant young Ivy League fellow who is responsible for Penny's condition.<br /><br />Given the limitations of his role, that of a poor but handsome sex-object abused by the rich women at Kellerman's Mountain House, Mr. Swayze is also good. He's even convincing when he must admit, in one of the film's lesser moments, that ''the reason people treat me like nothing is because I am nothing.'' He's at his best - as is the movie - when he's dancing.<br /><br />The movie makes a lot of good use of period music, to which some not very evocative new songs have been added. The dancing itself, especially the dirty dancing, choreographed by Kenny Ortega, looks very contemporary, or, at least, as contemporary as ''Saturday Night Fever,'' but it has a drive and a pulse that give the film real excitement. Though the film takes place in 1963, just a year after the twist was all the rage, the twist itself seems already to have come and gone at Kellerman's Mountain House. The women's clothes also look surprisingly mid-80's and, in 1963, would anybody have used the term ''wimp''?<br /><br />These anachronisms aren't especially important, except that Miss Bergstein has been so specific about the film's period. She seems to want ''Dirty Dancing'' to be seen as a fond goodbye to a comfortable, liberal American way of life before the country was radicalized by the assassination of President Kennedy and by the increasingly bitter anti-Vietnam War movement. That's loading a small movie with rather more than it can carry without a lot of highly detailed program notes.<br /><br />''Dirty Dancing'' works best when it's most direct and unpretentious. It has the kind of sweet simplicity that somehow always eludes John Hughes (''Sixteen Candles,'' ''Pretty in Pink,'' ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off''). Mr. Ardolino, whose background is in theater and in television dance films, doesn't clutter the film with extraneous, sentimental detail, nor even with too much colorful (and familiar) detail about life in yourusual Catskill resort hotel. He also obtains excellent performances from his cast, which, in addition to Miss Grey, Mr. Swayze and Miss Rhodes, includes Jerry Orbach, as Baby's father; Jack Weston, as the owner of Kellerman's, and Lonny Price, who is especially funny as Mr. Weston's arrogant, wimpish grandson.<br /><br />''Dirty Dancing,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''), includes some vulgar language and a lot of dancing that is comparatively erotic. Watch Your Step DIRTY DANCING, directed by Emile Ardolino; written by Eleanor Bergstein; director of photography, Jeff Jur; choreography by Kenny Ortega; music by John Morris; edited by Peter C. Frank; produced by Linda Gottlieb and Ms. Bergstein; released by Vestron Pictures.

B006HGXGWU|1.0|People who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars had to be paid by the movie company to increase DVD Sales.  don't waste your money or time. The actors were all great the story failed.  In the end the family stays together being washed away by a tidle wave?  Glad I saw it on Showtime.  I was wishing for a happy ending<br />or was it that all of them were going nuts.  I feel nuts now
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|I found this very entertaining as well as my wife and 12 year old. Definitely get the HD for the graphics, because they have a great effect in the movie.

B00821PCJS|5.0|Aliens and apocalypse seems like a warn out idea, but I really liked it.  I like the characters and the story lines.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Loved it. It will be a classic. The characters come alive and are multidimensional. The best read in a long time.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|The World According to Bob, much like the previous volume, is an absolute delight. You just can't put it down! I loved every single line of them both, but I think I liked this one better because we get to find out what happened to those two after the first book. Truly heartwarming. I suppose the only flaw is that I was left wanting for more Bob stories! :)
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I'm sure that this movie is meant for older people and it is a good choice for those who have thought about having to enter a nursing home.  Though most of us would not have the resources to choose such a lavish place as this one, the point of the movie is not that, but the idea that life, even at its end, can have meaning and joy.  Embrace your life up to the end with humor and grace.  Someone might say &#34;But you can't be happy with all kinds of aches and pains&#34;, but this movie tries to prove that you can.  It is truly a charming movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesomely fun game. Just a bit challenging but no hard if you have to hard of a time there are great walk thrus
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved the existing episodes. The show was cancelled long before any story arc could have been completed, but the 14 episodes at least give an indication as to what could have been possible.  The commentary was insightful and fun, but I would strongly recommend watching all the episodes first before playing them with commentary.  Highly recommended.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Best show! Love. Can't wait for season 5 to come out on DVD. Can't wait for the season 6 to air in the fall!
B000P0J09C|5.0|A great movie with a lot of stars.  It is definitely one you have to have if you are a collector.

B008JFUR10|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Guillermo Del Toro's work.He has a unique directing style.He provides good character development with breathtaking action scenes.I first became aware of him because of the work he did with 'Blade 2'.The best of the Blade series in my opinion.Last thing I saw was 'Pan's Labyrinth' and the creatures in that were uniquely horrible and grotesque and brought a new and disturbing style to the big screen.<br />You can see that style in these monstrous creatures that appear in our realm and they are wonderful to behold, as are the giant robots that battle them.Just about everything in this movie appealed to me ,from the character development to the fight scenes arising from conflict between the characters ,to the battle action with the monsters.I guess it was only a matter of time before humans driving massive robots was brought to western cinema as this sort of thing is quite common in eastern entertainment, especially in anime.<br />The acting was top notch.I hadn't seen Charlie Hunnam before and he did a great job as did the rest of the cast.<br />I have one complaint though.Two of the main characters were Australian.Being Australian myself,I won't say I was insulted,let's just say I was very disappointed that they had American actors portraying them and THIS happens EVERY time .....  OUR ACCENT IS BUTCHERED.A major plot shift occurs in Sydney.Why would you take the time to shoot a great scene with a monster rampaging past the Sydney Opera House and not have Aussies playing these characters ? We have a WEALTH of talent here.The rest of the world knows this.I don't need to list the many actors from here that are working in the states today.<br />In my opinion it's a bit of a sledge against our film industry and the Australian actors themselves.It detracted from my enjoyment of the film and I'm sure a lot of Australians will feel the same way.It's disrespectful.<br />Anyway , I'll get off my soapbox now and state that the film is well worth seeing, especially on the big screen.Check it out and ignore the Australian accents.The film is a ton of fun and it reminded me of those old Asian flicks you used to see on black and white TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon as a kid.The giant monsters battling it out or just one destroying a whole city brought back fond memories.With the special effects the way they are today,I was glued to the screen as I'm sure you will be as well.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Fantastic, we are hooked, have been watching it every night.  Some situations seem to be a bit contrived but the action is great.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this game. But I wish the updates could have new vehicles and &amp; such but anyway this game is FLIPPIN AWESOME! Also Adventure Time fans Cartoon Network has a new game featuring the characters of Adventure Time. You'll love it.

B00008S2VG|5.0|When this album was released back in 2003 it wasn't very popular. In my opinion this Madonna's best album of the 2000's. Much better then her latest effort MDNA. What draws me to this CD is the political messages of each song. The only song I guess that doesn't fit in with the rest of the album is Die Another Day. If your an fan of Madge this is an must have.
B004JK61K0|1.0|got it for the Doctor Who reference and I needed a Kindle mail app that worked with Gmail's ActiveSync service.  the Doctor Who reference was great, but adding my Gmail account to it just sucked.

B008C20TDG|5.0|This book explains in a simple, entertaining way why and how some of the foods you eat make you &#34;less healthy&#34;.<br /><br />I started off weighing 270 pounds. Over a year, I lost 40 pounds eating a &#34;conventional healthy diet&#34; low in fat and high in vegetables and whole grains and exercising. I was hungry all the time, with cravings and guilt when I'd indulge, not to mention weighing myself daily and keeping an excel spreadsheet of my progress and getting upset when the scale didn't move.<br /><br />Then I discovered It Starts With Food and jumped head first into my first Whole30 (turned into a Whole60). I lost 15 pounds in those 2 months, was never hungry, had no cravings or guilt, and developed a healthier relationship with food. My journey is not over, but thanks to this book, I feel better than I ever have before and have no intention of stopping eating a paleo diet.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book.  If you have read the other 2, you will enjoy this one too.  It is intense but worth the read to finish the three books.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game just epic! I like the easy controls and how fast you can level up. I just got this game yesterday and I am enjoying it. I would wake up in the morning just to play this fun game. Recommended to people who like war games also if you're ready for some excitement and Blitzs Brigade. Get it and ENJOY it!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This series is fun to watch. The dynamic between the two leads is interesting. I look forward to watching season 2.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|You can't beat the ladies of Cranford for their combination of excentricity and kindness. The moral values of the era are reflected in the decisions the characters make when faced with adversity. An enjoyable journey!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Good imagination mingled with our truths. Kept me wanting to read the next chapter and the next. It's creative and a fun read that takes you into their world
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I thought this game might have been for kids, but soon realized it was like a \\"Sim City\\" game but instead of a city, you build a giant coral reef. Game graphics look exceptionally great and game has all the characters from the movie. I'm impressed and would recommend. Also, save your \\"Pearls\\" in game, they are highly valuable.

B00BSN0K1C|3.0|I ended up really enjoying Man of Steel as a movie.<br /><br />Being a lifetime Superman fan, I felt I needed to get an item as my \\"souvenir\\" of the film. I chose this after a lot of personal debate. The alternative being the $100+ statues, maybe soon.<br /><br />This isnt a bad figure at all but not my favorite Superman figure that I own either. Articulation is good and the figure is poseable enough to have him look more natural. The benefits...the cape is long enough to support the figure, which comes with an \\"S\\" shield support base with the peg that goes into the bottom of the foot of the figure. Can you picture what Im talking about? The colors are great and I like that the fold for the cape sort of bows in a bit between his boots this helps support the figure.The size is perfect and better than the early release figure Id seen at a local department store, which was crazy small.<br /><br />My complaint, maybe just one, the face is NOT the one pictured on the listing. Look to the photo of the figure in the package this is closer to what I received. Also, mine does not have the somewhat goofy expression (almost like a smile) as the one in the listing package picture shows. I found the face on my figure somewhere between both the pictures shown.<br /><br />Over all I really like it, and Im glad its added to the collection.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|When I was young I was not a fan of grouping the super heros together like the 'Justice League' or 'The Avengers'. Each super hero had to fight alone for them to be interesting.  But have to say this movies brings everything together with great action, great characters, both good and evil, and great surprises.  You won't be disappointed seeing this movie!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Excellent!  Can't wait for Season 3!!!!  Have to watch one episode after another because you want to see what happens next!

0765334798|3.0|A novel with 3 codas.  The novel part had me laughing several times.  An interesting enough story.  What to do when you figure out that your life is controled by what happens to secondary character in a bad TV show where the secondary characters drop like flies.  The codas fill in some details on the life's of the individuals who play the secondary characters. Not up to the standards of Old Man's War but a quick amusing read.

B003XDVVO0|5.0|I love the Shayna Flat; I have this style in four colors and wear them all the time. Seriously, all. the. time. Around the house, in the yard, out on errands... I even have a black pair and a brown pair I wear in the office when I don't have clients coming in! (And this might sound crazy but the days I wear my Crocs to work I'm always in a better mood!) :)<br />The Shayna Flat has a nice wide toe box, so you don't get cramped toes like in sneakers or some of the pointy-toed Crocs flats. The slingback Mary-Jane style is very comfortable.  The only time I ever had issues with this shoe was when I wore them flying my feet swelled so they became tight. :(  Otherwise, awesome comfort at a great price?  Just buy 'em and try 'em; worst case I think Amazon has free returns on shoes... not that you'll need it! :)

B008I34ZFW|2.0|The point of this movie is not the moon Nazis or what they represent. In fact, the moon Nazi's pose no real threat to the world that has moved beyond them technologically so far that a cell phone seems like magic to them. They come in giant blimp shaped spaceships that are the carriers for disc shaped vessels that look like typical UFO's, but shoot out bullets like WWI fighter planes. Meanwhile, the other countries of the world have been building up for a star wars type action for years, and have constructed space going vessels armed with nuclear devices that easily destroy all the Nazi ships and their moon base in one action.<br /><br />Instead, this movie seems to be a spoof of the American political system. The President in the movie is a Sarah Palin type character who cares more for reelection than anything else. She uses Nazi type propaganda speeches to help win support. She has a shady campaign manager who is a master at manipulation. She toys with the fact of starting a war to strengthen her chances for a second term. She says things like, \\"You all broke you words; it's okay for us to do it because that's what we do\\", and later, she and her secretary of defense start a fist fight in the United Nations over their claim of the moon.<br /><br />Also, James Washington's character only serves to reinforce negative racial stereotypes. Although he is an astronaut, he still uses urban dialect. When he makes his escape early on in the movie, he adds a \\"you'll be sorry you did that, white boy.\\" Later, when he gets his color restored, he comes onto the scene looking like Eddie Murphy playing Buckwheat.<br /><br />I will not attempt to address the scientific inaccuracies, because I don't think that was the point of the movie, nor is it my field of expertise, but other slight gaps I will mention. For example, when Adler, Renata, and James come to Earth for the first time, they land on a farm in upstate New York, where a lady with a shot gun sees them come out of their spaceship and chases them off her property with a shot gun. In a later scene, that supposedly takes place a few months after that, Renata and James take that same ship back to the moon. This whole time, the farmer that chased them away did not report that giant space ship sitting on her property? Also, when Renata sees James on the street as a homeless man, he has about 3-4 years of hair growth in what has only been a few months.

In a later scene, that supposedly takes place a few months after that, Renata and James take that same ship back to the moon. This whole time, the farmer that chased them away did not report that giant space ship sitting on her property?

B0046B1KHG|3.0|This movie was cute. The antics of the minions are the best part. It moves slow. A good movie for the 3-5 age group.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and I loved almost everything about this movie.  The plot was fun and creative.  The characters were fresh and believable.  And the content was family friendly.  The only thing we could have done without were Vector's disgusting hip thrusts.  Other than that, we'd highly recommend for adults or children and we're looking forward to the sequel.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The wonderful wizard of oz was written so you could relate to the characters easily it was very descriptive but not enough to make it bland. All in all a wonderful book
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|You have to be logged into internet service to play it.  Not an option for me as my internet service is limited!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Very insightful and hopefully it makes everyone want to become more knowledgeable about what we put into our bodies and demand better from our farmers and food (if you can even call some of them that) companies
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun! Really makes you think! Starts out simple and progressively gets more involved. Great game to use your brain!

B001DF68MA|3.0|For the parent, the fit of the seat on the bike is good, you dont really have to adjust much of your riding to accomodate the seat. Installation was straight forward. 3 items a can be improved, the attachement to place seat on bike mount is a hussle, have to figure where the hole is while you cant really see. The hips part of the seat is a little too tight for baby, my 2 year old just fits and she is not overweight but just big for her age, and she JUST fits, the foot rest is a little too hight, should have been adjustable, i feel like her knees are too high!<br />Other than this i love it so far, for the cost its just fine!
