B00005JMYI|1.0|Do not waste your time - this has to be one of the worst movies of the decade. Not a moment of humor, the acting is pathetic and there is no story line. It is a stupid movie and obviously is aimed at those with an intelligence level below an ameba.
B0000542D2|5.0|A Hard Days Night, the Beatles first film, became a classic quite by accident. Filmed in black and white(because it was cheaper) and short on plot, United Artist was simply trying to cash in on the wave of success that the Beatles were riding in 1964. The film was meant to showcase the Beatles music more than anything else, because that's what the fans wanted. By not having a heavy plot, John, Paul, George and Ringo were able to act more naturally and that resulted in the film looking more like a documentary of the bands' daily life in the throes of \\"Beatlemania\\" rather than a pop band exploitation film. <br />  Director Richard Lester left it up to the Beatles, through their energy and sense of humor, to keep things moving and they delivered. Throughout, you get a slice of their individual personalities, Johns' sarcasm, Pauls' charm, Georges' elusiveness and Ringos' wittiness.The interaction between them and their\\" manager and roadie\\" in the film give a glimpse of what being on the road constantly must have been like. They gripe, they snipe at each other and they get into mischief just to releive the boredom of travel and being stuck in one place until it's time to go on stage again.There are no tv sets flying out of hotel rooms but there are hints of what would come years down the road when r&r bands began trashing their quarters due to pent up energy and frustration at being \\"stuck\\" in one place for too long. <br />   The Beatles and their music are the stars of the movie. Songs written for the film are interspersed throughout, culminating in a concert at the end. Unfortuanetely they lip-sync the performance but that is probably because the audio technology available at that time would not have served the Beatles well if they actually had played \\"live\\".Even so, you get the idea what a live performance of the Beatles was like at that time with fans screaming and jumping throughout. <br />   These days Hard Days Night in seen by many film critics including Roger Ebert, as an art film.What was probably thought of as a teen throwaway film in it's time became a film for all times.Of all Beatle  films, this is the best but I would recommend pairing this one with their swan song film, \\"Let It Be\\", if you can find a copy somewhere. Currently that film is unavailable for some reason but it shows where the Beatles went as a band in just a few short years. In the studio they bicker, they look bored and they seem to be tired of each other and the whole idea of being Beatles anymore....quite a contrast to Hard Days Night, where they are fresh, exuberant and still hungry to be the greatest, which they were and still are....
B00006L83N|4.0|I purchased this album on a whim and I must admit that it was a pleasant suprise.  When I first played the CD, I thought to myself \\"What the hell is this!\\"  It was that good.  The album is well produced and each song is powerful.  As a die hard Dream Theater fan, ~Symphony X with \\"The Odyssey\\" proved that there are other progressive metal bands worth searching for.  If you are a progressive metal fan, you will not be disapointed!
0790744295|4.0|I want to start out by saying to anyone who hasn't seen the movie that it is not particularly scary to anyone over 10. It is, however, a fun movie that is sure to entertain. The movie is made up of 5 short stories out of a comic book a boy's dad throws away at the beginning of the movie.    Father's Day:   This is the campiest story out of the bunch. A lot of people don't like it but I think it's good because it doesn't try to be anymore than it is: a fun campy little story. It is about a disturbed woman named Bedelia Grantham(Viveca Lindfors)who became enraged at her father years earlier and killed him on Father's Day. Now years later the Grantham family have gathered for a dinner and are waiting on Bedelia to arrive. When she finally arrives she goes out to the graveyard and accidently spills some liquor on her father's grave and somehow this brings him back to life and he proceeds to take revenge while looking for his Father's Day cake.    The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill:  This is hands down the worst of the segments. Stephen King stars as Jordy Verrill who discovers a meteor in his yard. It cracks open and causes everything in sight to start sprouting plants including Verrill, who touches it. This is supposed to be funny I guess but it is just a waste of time. Whenever I watch this movie I always skip this segment.    Something To Tide You Over:  This,along with the last story,is probably my favorite segment of the movie. It is about a sadistic millionaire Richard Vickers(Leslie Nielsen) who finds out his wife,Becky,is having an affair with a man named Harry Wentworth(Ted Danson)and exacts revenge on them by burying them up to their necks in sand and letting them drown in the tide. Nielsen and Danson both give great performances. I loved seeing Leslie Nielsen as the villain. He's over the top but not too much and Danson is solid as a guy who made a bad decision but doesn't deserve the punishment he receives.    The Crate:  This is another great segment and while it's not very scary compared to some other movies I've seen it is probably the scariest out of all these stories. It stars Hal Holbrook as Henry Northrup, a meek college professor who spends his time thinking about killing his incredibly obnoxious wife Wilma(Adrienne Barbeau)and playing chess with his friend Dexter Stanley(Fritz Weaver)who is also a college professor. One day Dexter gets a call about a mysterious crate that a janitor has found under the stairs. The janitor and Dexter open the crate I find a very hungry creature inside of it. After it eats the janitor and Charlie Gereson,a student,Dexter drives to Henry's house and hysterically tells him the story. Henry gives Dexter some pills to put him to sleep for awhile and leaves his wife a note to meet him at the college(so he can feed her to the creature) and cleans up the mess before she arrives. Everyone involved gave great performances. Holbrook was excellent as the wimp who ends up resolving the whole situation, Weaver was solid as the dignified Prof. Stanley who turns into a hysterical mess after his contact with the creature and Barbeau was way over the top as the wife who you really want to see gone.    They're Creeping Up On You:  This is either my favorite or 2nd favorite of the stories. A heartless insect phobic millionaire, Upson Pratt(E.G. Marshall) is having a particularly bad cockroach problem one night. That's really all there is to the plot, but it's the most famous segment in this movie. The reason is probably because of the disgusting ending but what makes the story so good is Marshall's ourageous performance as a heartless man who rejoices when his main competitor commits suicide. It's an outstanding performance.     FINAL WORD: This is not a work of art just a fun enjoyable movie that will definently entertain you.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|<br />\\"Pocahontas\\" is the first Disney movie aimed at the adult audience rather than kids. While previous animated features were filled with lots of humor, talking animals/objects/cartoonish-looking characters, \\"Pocahontas\\" is a complete opposite, therefore it's got many people complaining about. Aside from the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith, the main theme of the movie is the strong message of tolerance, harmony and wisdom. Some viewers need to understand that this film was created to teach our minds and touch our hearts, whereas the entertainment value is not the most important this time. <br /> <br />\\"Pocahontas\\" brings honor to the Native American society, perfectly reflecting the beauty of their world, that was so different than the \\"civilized\\" one. The Indians are presented as the spiritual people, respecting their land and all the forces of nature. In the most memorable sequence, Pocahontas is singing: \\"I know every rock and tree and creature has a life, has a spirit, has a name/ And we are all connected to each other in a circle, in a hoop that never ends\\". This message is very inspiring to both adults and children, as nowadays, in the world ruled by money, we're so blinded and preoccupied with the material values, that we forget what's basic and ultimate. In terms of giving a valuable lesson, \\"Pocahontas\\" is probably Disney's most important movie to date.  <br /> <br />Animation and the backgrounds are just stunning. Pastel-dominated color palette makes the film a wonderful visual experience. Unlike \\"Aladdin\\" or \\"The Little Mermaid\\", \\"Pocahontas\\" has far more realistic character design. No huge eyes, no too big heads and anorectic postures; all the characters seem to be made of flesh and blood and are so perfectly animated, that sometimes you forget they're just hand-drawn cartoons. All the animators (we have an excellent opportunity to \\"meet\\" them, thanks to the bonus material on the dvd) captured the personalities of the characters, transfering their own vision, emotions and sense of style into paper. The most wonderful of them all is, of course, Glen Keane, the Pocahontas' animator who has made an impressive progress since the plain Ariel days. While \\"the mermaid\\" definitely didn't look top-notch, Pocahontas looks just too good! She's anatomically perfect, she has a beautiful and sophisticated facial features and looks like an extremely talented actress - if it wasn't for the fact she's animated, she could be Hollywood's hottest lady. Oh, and that voice... <br /> <br />The voice actors - while the animator provides the looks, it's the actor who captures the spirit. Spirit of Pocahontas is simply beautiful, thanks to Irene Bedard, who's voice sounds maturer and deeper than any Disney heroine before. Irene, a Native American actress (who looks surprisingly similar to Pocahontas), did an outstanding job making her character unique and multi-dimensional. Irene also hosts \\"The Making Of Pocahontas\\" available on the 10th anniversary dvd, so we can see how beautiful and lovely she actually is. Another surprise is David Odgen Stiers, a Disney veteran, who's credits include many many characters (f.ex. Cogsworth in \\"Beauty & the Beast\\") - this time he's a villain,  Governor Ratcliffe, as well as his servant Wiggins (!!!). Ratcliff is a perfectly arogant and wicked huge man, while Wiggins is an annoying little guy - I can't help but admiring this extremely versatile actor. Mel Gibson does a great job as John Smith - I really liked his performance. Pocahontas' father, chief Powhatan is voiced by Russel Means - his deep voice perfectly fits the character. It's no secret that Disney voice casts have always been flawless and this time the voice makeovers are just perfect. <br /> <br />If you're not an animation fan, the reason you should see Pocahontas\\" anyway, is the amazingly beautiful music composed by a musical genius, Alan Menken.  \\"Pocahontas\\" soundtrack is mellower than any of previous Disney soundtracks, as the movie is rather adult-themed. I'm pretty sure that if it wasn't for Menken's music, \\"Pocahontas\\" wouldn't have been such a remarkable work of art as it is. The soundtrack is engaging on each level - both musically and lirycally (Stephen Schwartz wrote great lyrics). It truly reflects (or maybe creates) the atmosphere of the story. Instrumental tracks are the perfect background to the events of the story - they're very cinematic and telling; there are several moments in the movie when the characters don't need to say anything, for the music says it all. The Broadway style musical numbers are very important to the action - they establish the characters' point of view in a unique and memorable way.  <br /> <br />The \\"Pocahontas\\" leading lady's songs are the true standouts - Pocahontas got to sing the most beautiful and valuable songs the Disney heroine has ever been apriveleged to sing. \\"Just Around The Riverbend\\" is a lively manifesto of Pocahontas' independent and adventurous spirit - it's the first time in a movie when we begin to love the character. But the strongest moment comes with \\"Colors of the Wind\\" - Pocahontas' anthem of wisdom, love and harmony - the message of this song is ultimate to our world and all the universe. Listening to \\"Colors of the Wind\\" is nothing short of unforgettable EXPERIENCE and I believe it's one of the best songs in history (well deserved Academy Award). Pocahontas' singing voice is provided by a Broadway veteran, Judy Kuhn. What's very interesting, she had been casted before they even found a speaking voice of the character. Hearing her voice I can easily see why - Judy has this unique ability to give a strong, emotional performance without getting whiny or trying to hard. Everything's in control yet honest, humble yet impressive, mature yet youthful. That stands for Pocahontas' personality - Judy makes her sound like a self-confident, unapologetic young woman who doesn't want to prove anything, but demonstrates her beliefs andwants to be taken the way she is. I also adore the Polish version of singing Pocahontas, beautifully sung by the wonderful Edyta Gorniak, who sounds different than Judy Kuhn, but is equally perfect. <br /> <br />If you complain that \\"Pocahontas\\" is not historically accurate, note that in fact it wasn't meant to be. It's based on a legend of Pocahontas, who was the inspiration to make a valuable movie with strong message. So perceive this film as a whole new story and open your mind to enjoy it the way it deserves.  It's a little uncoventional for a Disney film, but that only makes it special. <br /> <br />\\"Pocahontas\\" - this movie is the paradise to the eyes, heaven to the ears, and bliss to the soul. A must-see masterpiece!
6303148352|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  No other dinosaur movie quite matches Jurassic Park.  Combined with Spielberg's fresh and ingenious plot and script, along with the wonderful acting (and/or scream antics:)) of Sam Neill and Laura Dern (the main characters, Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler), and the incredible CGI techniques for the dinosaurs, this movie comes alive with realistic settings and edge-of-your-seat surprises.  I haven't yet seen numbers 2 or 3 of the movie, and I'm sure they won't quite match the 1st.  Please buy this movie if you haven't already.  I guarantee that it'll be worth all the money!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is the album that completed my Radiohead album collection. It is also one of my favorite albums. The minute I put this album in my cd player and heard the amazing song 2+2=5 (the best opener for any Radiohead album) I knew there was something special about it. My love for the album only grew after hearing songs like \\"There There\\", \\"Myxomatosis\\"( My favorite on the album) and the beautiful \\"A Wolf at the Door\\". Some other highlights include \\"Go to Sleep\\" and \\"Sit Down. Stand Up.\\" I only had a problem with two of the songs, \\"Scatterbrain (As Boring as Leaves)\\" and \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" Those two dropped the album flat but other songs were able to rebuild it. Overall, this is Radiohead's third greatest album (behind The Bends and OK computer), but still a treat for the ears.
184121602X|5.0|\\"I have this little sister, Lola. She is small and very funny.\\"<br />Charlie and Lola are two siblings who live in a flat in London with their Mum and Dad. Charlie is the older of the two, he is responsible and quite a clever chap. Lola is the younger sibling, she is small, funny and proves to be quite amusing. In this particular story Charlie uses his creativity/ingeuinity to get \\"picky eater\\" Lola to eat her dinner. The story is fun for both grown ups and children. Lauren Child is both the author and illustrator of this series. She combines mixed media for the illustrations, which are just fantastic! There are three books in the series \\" I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato, I Am Too Absolutely Small For School and I Am Not Sleepy and I Will Not Go To Bed\\". Charlie and Lola are also the stars of their own television show on Playhouse Disney weekdays. Charlie and Lola are the best British import since Harry Potter!
B0009KA7BS|2.0|Constantine was a big disappointment to me. Unlike many other reviewers, I had never seen this in print. Reeves does a fair job in his role, but Rachel Weisz fails to deliver here. Her character is unconvincing and \\"wooden\\". The story is a remix of story lines from other stories, and it fails to bring much that is fresh to the screen. The theology is strange, Satan looks like a retired guy from Florida, and the \\"balance between good and evil\\" rule seems contrived.<br /><br />The story was not compelling. I almost turned it off out of boredom.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|As everyone's heard before, you either love it or hate it. I thought it was the most hilarious movie I've ever seen, I've rented it 10 times, and will buy it once the price comes down below 19.99 ;) I just found Napoleons response even to a simple question hilarious! WOW, I still laugh when I just think about it.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|\\"Shall We Dance\\" is alarming with how calm a film it is.It starts off in a manner unknown to me.Using directional synchronisation,it somehow collides with the monotonity of a certain month in a middle aged man's life that isn't going too well. He travels from work to home via a train. He notices Jennifer Lopez standing on the balcony of a dance school. The next day, he notices the same and this time he notices she's looking to the darkness within and  beyond  (Yeah I've read Ayn Rand)Like most curious men would do but be discreet about it, he decides to check up on it.He joins the school and thus begins some fun.<br /><br />There is strange comedy in the eyes and facial expressions of Richard Gere. I laughed a lot in the first 45 minutes. The best scene in the film was also the only swearing used in the film at all. I won't spoil this movie for you and I'm sorry if my comprehension makes it any less interesting.<br /><br />I'm usually very strict on movies with fairy tale endings but I'll let this one be because it is done with an extremely laid back screenplay. I don't think it would make any difference to my movie experience if I deleted the last 300 seconds or so.<br /><br />Anyhow,there's a certain dialogue in the film by Susan S. which describes marriage. Look out for that.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to everyone though because a few have the power to observe. Also a slight flaw lies in how quickly Richard Gere gets results on everything he does. He gets a letter from Paulina and more. It seems a bit too movie like for me to swallow. I can only wish people were that non complacent in expression of their emotions, verbal or written.<br /><br />Enjoy it anyway
B000063DI9|5.0|Ok, so I read most of the reviews below that other people wrote and thought that some truth needs to be put on here! All those other reviews pretty much are terrible! I am going to go through each track and as I review each one separately, I'll be listening to them. I'm going to make sure everyone knows just how good this album is, which is probably they're best one ever or in The Top 3.  <br />For the opening track, Moonchild. This song is just beautiful to start off with, once we have the Hell readings done, and reading about 7 stuff, haha. First Dave Murray and Adrian Smith do some amazing guitar strings for the first moments. Then Bruce starts to sing as if he's the Moonchild and then during the chorus, he's like looking at it from 3rd person, it's interesting... <br />Infinite Dreams, possibly the most amazing track on here, is just amazing. Just amazing. Its hard enough to describe but this is good for multiple reasons. It has its heavy parts, it has its slow and light parts. Yah, its one of those good songs. It sounds as if Bruce is a psychologist at parts... asking you what are you, spiritualist, or an unbeliever, and asking if you'd rather end up in Heaven or in Hell. Its very much so like this. And so far, from all of my friends that I have that like Iron Maiden, they all love this song, because it's GOOD, PERIOD. <br />Concerning Can I Play With Madness, one guy said something against this song, if the band found out a fan didn't like that song, they'd have it be arranged for him to be shot. That is how good this song is. The band jumps out at you with question, Can I Play With Madness? But please, don't talk to your CD player or iPod, whatever you have, they are not going to respond. Hahaha. The bass on this song is just amazing, Steve is keeping up his usual constant speedy, RARE, bass playing, not many bass players are as good as he is. And the lyrics are so catchy, you'll get up and start singing along and forget about the instant messages you are getting on your computer. <br />About The Evil That Men Do, it starts out slowly at first, but then, very quickly, it speeds up and leaves everything behind. It gets all those headbangers out there like me to start haha. And it has you asking, what is this evil that men do, that lives on and on, should i worry? YES! You should haha! But so this a very good song.  <br />Now, for the amazingly long, beautifully done, epic, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son! *Crowd goes wild!* First of all, this has an awesome background sort of choir, going all ooooooaaoooooaaooooo. Something like that haha... But so, the drumming is very neat in this song. And like the other reviewer put it, sounds like Bruce is reading out of some sinister like ancient book or something of the same nature. This song also has Christians, at least ones like me automatically liking it, because its about 7 and everything is awesome, so basically, not even a minister could complain about this song. When Bruce is done singing, at about the 5:30 mark, out of about 10 minutes of song, it goes to full instrumental. And from then on its just have fun with your air guitar or air drums! IT IS VERY NEAT SOUNDING, CANT DESCRIBE!!! <br />For The Prophecy, it sounds like continuing from where they set off on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, light and nice. Not the heaviest of songs really... You need patience to go through the last quarter of this song. <br />The Clairvoyant, one of their other top songs on this album, the bass playing is amazing! From the beginning to the very end, you can hear it a lot clearer than any other song. VERY catchy chorus! VERY good song. I don't have much time left, but this song would need more review. <br />Only the Good Die Young, is not as good as any of the other songs, but is still very good. So, I don't have as much to say about it. I'd just say, good chorus, good story to it. <br />Out of 5 stars--  <br />Moonchild- 4.5 stars <br />Infinite Dreams- 5.5 stars <br />Can I Play With Madness- 5.25 stars <br />The Evil That Men Do- 5 stars <br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son- 5.75 stars <br />The Prophecy- 4.75 stars <br />The Clairvoyant- 5.25 stars <br />Only the Good Die Young- 4.4 stars
B000001FFJ|5.0|I mean the title of this review as a complete compliment. This album undresses my socks with a furious punch and leaves me wandering in Singapore, Hong Kong, New York wondering why I left my heart on the subway, on the elevated train, and if maybe that harlot in purple may be coming back to me with more lip gloss and cheap cigarettes. An acquired taste for some I guess, but I find Tom Waits and this album in particular to be one of the most astounding artistic statements ever made in rock music, an art form dying for truly profound artistic statements. \\"9th and Hennepin\\" is one of the greatest marriages of poetry and words ever achieved in rock music, when Waits says that steam is rising out of the belly of the city you really SEE it, just as you really see the downtown trains, grimy old dimes and Cincinnati jackets his musky, creaky old voice wails of.  A brilliant downtown album (at least a downtown late 19th early 20th century album) that will enlighten and confound your brain without cessation.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|In my last review I stated that I was angry FOX took off 'Dark Angel' to air Firefly. Then another reviewer gives this big long explanation on why it was cancelled. Let me tell you something KAD, Dark Angel could have lasted at least 5 seasons. If FOX was serious about Firefly they should have aired the episodes in the correct order. FOX should have known Firefly wouldn't last if the story arch was out of order. So basically they took off a show that would have lasted to put a shown on that would be aired out of order. I think maybe if FOX aired Firefly in order it might have lasted 3 seasons, but since they didn't the world will never know. I'm sorry that I'm a hard core Dark Angel fan, but I don't know hy Firefly wasn't aired on SCIFI in the first place. It would have saved DARK ANGEL fan a loss of a great show. <br />The only reason why I gave this show 2 stars is because it was very creative of Joss to think of a Space Western
B000001AI7|5.0|GOT TO BE THERE will always hold a special place in my heart. It was the very first album I ever purchased when I was a little kid...the VERY FIRST!! I was already a die-hard J-5 fan by 1971, and as hard as it was to save my allowance to buy GOT TO BE THERE, it was worth every penny! It still is.<br /><br />Michael Jackson...my first crush, the first singer that really and truly moved me because he was only a few years older than I was, and this was his first solo album!! Forget what SOME people will say about OFF THE WALL being Mike's first outing away from the Jacksons (or should I say the Jackson 5, as they were still being called in 1971). Those people obviously don't know anything about the solo career MJ had on Motown; they simply group his solo work with that of his brothers - which there is nothing wrong with that, but Mike DID do solo work. So what if his brothers were singing background on those solo cuts?<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Got To Be There\\" was Michael's first solo single, and his first hit. The rest of the album does not disappoint. All of the soul, passion and energy that was evident on MJ's J-5 work is present here: From the breathtaking reworking of Bill Withers' \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" to the funky remake of Bobby Day's \\"Rockin' Robin\\", to the James Taylor classic \\"You've Got a Friend\\", the young Michael displays an amazingly mature vocal style that only showcases what would come in later years for him. One should not dismiss this as just another \\"bubble gum\\" pop/soul offering from a kiddie artist, which at the time, the industry seemed to be overrun with them (i.e. Donny Osmond, Foster Sylvers, Chee Chee and Peppy, etc.). It was, and still is, appealing to adults as well. Everything on this album (CD) clicks. Anytime I want to take a trip down memory lane, I play this and remember how much I  loved Michael back then.<br /><br />Standouts are \\"Maria (You Were The Only One)\\", \\"Girl Don't Take Your Love From Me\\", \\"Wings of My Love\\", \\"In Our Small Way\\" and Mike's second hit, \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\", but like I said, everything is enjoyable on it. Michael Jackson is a legend! No matter how history may try to smear his image or what he has done to himself over his adult years, NOTHING can change the fact that he was/is a remarkable talent. He made wonderful music, influenced and inspired millions of kids over three generations. GOT TO BE THERE is where it all began. It's a true classic, a must have.anna Be Where You Are\\", but like I said, everything is enjoyable on it. Michael Jackson is a legend!

B000021XS0|5.0|Since I first heard Dream Theater, I've been hooked, recently I had the chance to listen this CD, and what a masterpiece!! It tells us about Nicholas, who is having visions of a woman called Victoria, Nicholas is with the Hypnotherapist, which transports him through time to 1928, where Victoria was murdered. <br />The music is spine - chilling, I'd highlight Strange Deja Vu, The Spirit Carries On, Home, The Dance of Eternity and Fatal Tragedy. <br />All songs are excellent, but those are the ones that made me chill with emotion and feeling. <br />These guys are just gods with their instruments, Portnoy in his majestic drums, Myung in his 6-string bass, Petrucci-sama with his guitar, and Jordan Rudess, also called The Key Wizard. <br />All the CD tells the story of Nicholas, how he tries to uncover the mystery of Victoria's murder. <br />I will not go in-depth in the story, you must listen (And read) it all by yourself. <br />This CD can't be described with words, buy it if you're reading this, and listen it all way through, until you reach the cryptic-spine chilling ending phrase... <br />\\"Open your Eyes Nicholas...\\" And then?? Nicholas is dead.
B000068FY1|5.0|My favorite album. Every song is perfect and listening to it always takes me back to the days when nothing really mattered but the music. <br />
B00079ZACM|5.0|A.E.W. Mason's great adventure story has been filmed several times from 1921 to 2002 but never better than in this 1939 Korda British production. Another reviewer said MGM should be ashamed of the quality of this DVD but we must have seen different releases, although in reality there has only been this one! This transfer is extremely clean, no dirt or scratches to speak of and the three strip British Technicolor looks about as good as it can for a film of this vintage, at least without a frame by frame restoration as was done with \\"Gone With the Wind\\". It's the best quality I've ever seen on this title and I've seen it on cable TV, on Laserdisc (big disappointment there!) and on 16mm and 35mm film. It may be a little dull for modern audiences used to carnage and explosions every five minutes but if you enjoy good acting and a well crafted production, this one is well worth the low price. The original theatrical trailer is included, which gives you an idea how bad some of the prints of the feature used to look!
B00005NNMK|1.0|HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Man this album is so bad i can't see why anyone would take these guys seriously.  They can't write songs to save there life.  I'm not even going to say anything else about it.  All I can say is this is some of the worst metal I have ever heard.  They should put this crap out of print.  This is so bad it really deserves no stars but amazon is making me give it at most one. (...)
B00080ZG10|1.0|I don't like Scorsese; I like some of his movies, \\"TAXI DRIVER\\" for example, but who doesn't?<br /><br />However, since I like flying very much, I watched the movie before buying it -suddenly I got old and became a logic person when it comes to buying things!!- again I got another logic reason for not liking Scorsese.<br /><br />Then I was astonished by the number of reviews in Amazon. And trusting that I would not add new negative things about the movie, I collected all beautiful ideas from previous negative reviews and revive it here (since positive reviews are repeated stereotypes); enjoy it, and don't buy the movie:<br /><br />\\"I LOVE Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, but as Howard Hughes' mental state starts to decline, so does the movie.\\"<br /><br />\\"And then there is the acting. Every time Leonardo opens his mouth we are reminded, not of Howard Hughes, but of Leonardo DiCaprio pretending to speak with a Texas accent. DiCaprio is never convincing as Hughes\\"<br /><br />\\"I now see why \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" won Best Picture..., ...Because \\"The Aviator\\" loses major steam the second that Cate Blanchette (Hepburn) disappears from the screen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Simply put, the movie completely ignores the drug/psychiatric connection to Hughes' eventual collapse. Always an eccentric Hughes became a morphine addict after his near fatal crash.

B000063DFN|5.0|If I had to pick a best Iron Maiden album I would probably say this is it.  Every single song on here is a winner and has great album cover art.  Iron Maiden is my favorite metal band and Bruce Dickinson is the greatest singer in metal.  The albums starts off with a punch with The excellent opener Aces High.  Definetly and head banging piece.  Two Minutes To Midnight is about just as good.  Another great one which is the other hit on the album.  The Duellist is one of my favorites if not my favorite.  And man Flash Of The Blade is some of Steve Harris's best writing.  the last two songs the title track and Rime Of The Ancient Marriner are the perfect closers and many meiden fans say that Marriner is the best song.  I won't argue with them but to actually say the best song on here.  I just can't right now.  I want to say The Duellists but then there's Aces High and Flash Of The Blade, and Powerslave and Rime Of The Ancient Marriner and well you get the idea.  Anyway if you are wondering which album to start with to get into Maiden I would totaly recomend this one.  It was my first one and is so far my favorite.  Probably the most important metal album in 84.  Buy this album to start your collection.
B00082IJ08|2.0|The previous Gorillaz-album derived its sound for at least 80% from The Automator's deep & heavy beats, which gave most of the tracks a dark twist, contrasting well with the cartoonish image of the band. Now... it's just pop, with very generic beats, at that.  <br /> <br />So, it looks like this is a typical 2nd album after all. Hopefully the successor will be better.. perhaps they can sway The Automator to come back?
B0002OERI0|1.0|I was a fan of Green Day but only for the album dookie..sadly with this album came out I no longer liked anything my green day.Seeing 9 year olds with their American Idiot shirts running around made me want to puke. <br /> <br />When the video American idiot came out,I wasn't that eager to hear it(since i was only a fan of dookie) and after hearing it, I instantlly knew that people who had never heard of green day in their lifes would instantlly eat this up.Billie and his band had sold out.(I knew someday it would happen).This cd is supposed to be *punk* but its nothing close.They came out with a lame pop punk cd that had sell out written all over it. <br /> <br />But of course selling out maybe the best for them since they got more fans of this than they ever had in the past years.I'm 14 but I seem to now that this is onw lame cd <br /> <br />green day 1 star for getting as many fans as you did.I applaud you,you sellouts
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is a very comical, very dark look at American society through the eyes of two teenage misfits.  Recent high school graduates Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two girls who are outsiders, and that's how they like it.  They can't stand America's obsession with pop-culture, non-conformism, and retro styles.  They try to seperate themselves any way that they can.  They like to play cruel pranks on people they don't like or tell people awful things, true or false.  They hassle a boy (Brad Renfro) who works at a convenience store, they make fun of the valedictorian (Rini Bell), who is in a wheel chair and neck brace due to an accident involving alcohol, and they show up at Wowsville, a 50's nostalgia cafe that plays rap and techno music, just so they can mock the establishment to the waiters.   Neither of them are virgins, but I think that they were only messing with the guys that had sex with them (it's never directly stated, but I came to that conclusion myself, especially since their personalities would drive most guys away).  While most of the people/things that they attack deserve criticim (the valedictorian states in her speech that she no longer needs drugs, she is later seen drinking from a flask, and Wowsville is a poor excuse for a 50's diner), they still focus their time and energy on these things.  They even buy food at Wowsville, thus supporting the very thing they make fun of.  It seems as if even they can't seem to completely detatch themselves from the things they claim to hate so much. <br />Neither of them plan on going to college, probably because it's what \\"everyone\\" is doing.  Instead, they try to find jobs so that they can move in together.  However, while Rebecca gets a job at a coffee shop (not Starbucks, but the same kind of place) and begins to grow up out of her high school persona, Enid is unable to either hold a job or outgrow her old, sarcastic self (which is part of the reason she can't hold onto a job).  She is perfectly happy going through life, criticizing the people and things she finds to be stupid (which is nearly everyone and everything).  Then she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-aged record collector who turns out to be a target of one of her pranks.  Even though she looks down on him, thinking he's a loser, she can't help but become somewhat attracted to him, both mentally and physically.  As she later states, \\"He's the opposite of everything I hate\\". <br />Ghost World follows Enid, Rebecca, and Seymour over the course of the summer following their graduation.  Enid must attend a summer school art class (she failed during the year, and probably because even though she is a great artist, she doesn't conform to the teacher's nonconformist ways, if that makes sense).  Rebecca searches for apartments, while Enid shoots down her every suggestion, and the two best friends begin to pull apart.  Enid also spends a lot of time with Seymour, trying to get him to go on dates, but secretly hoping that he will ask her out. <br />Not everyone will understand this movie.  Some people who do may find it to be too dark, or depressing, or pessimistic.  Personally, I found it to be hilarious and somewhat poignant, which is strange, seeing as how I am probably a likely target for one of their pranks.
B000000993|4.0|I am a fan of both chevelle and a perfect circle.But if you ask me to choose between them?I would say tool.why?because chevelle and a prefect circle have similar vocals.But,Tool blew me away,the first time I heard sober I knew that this band was way better than chevelle and a perfect circle.That doesn't mean that they aren't any good.I recommend Point #1 and Wonder what's next by chevelle and everything by a perfect circle if your fans of this album. <br /> <br />The reason I would pick Tool over Chevelle and a perfect circle is because of their unique sound that overruns the other two.maynard is in a perfect circle but was the best in tool.This is a great album and tool has easily become one of my favorite bands.
068987474X|2.0|Relationships dont work when a man and women are totally equal 50/50. Too much tension, and power struggling. The most successful marriages I know are when either the man or woman has slightly more control. This book is for women who are \\"man-haters\\", or soon will be. I can sum up this book with one thought. When a man does one stupid thing, dump him. Thats the message here. DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU ARE MARRIED, WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
B0000025BL|4.0|this cd is one of the best I've heard.Every instrument in every song just seems to fall into place.The vocals are remarkable and the lyrics make sense for every track.It's unbelieveable how many times I can listen to this album.i highly recommend this album.Of course the best tracks are bat out of hell and paradise by the dashhboard light.pick this cd up now!
B000A0GP0Y|1.0|I saw \\"The Wedding Crashers\\" the other day. I had a great time and thought it was very funny. It's important to point this out because I want to give an example of a recent comedy I thought was good. Later on that night I watched the Adam Sandler remake of the 1974 Burt Reynolds comedy \\"The Longest Yard.\\" Adam Sandler is not Burt Reynolds (who is also in this version) and he never will be. If he has acting ability this movie doesn't make it known. Don't get me wrong. I liked some of his earlier films such as \\"The Waterboy\\" and \\"Happy Gilmore\\" but this is too much of the same thing and sandler knows it. He looks like he was too tired to phone it in and had his cousin do it. The rest of the cast is filled out with Nelly(yes, that Nelly - and no it's not that hot in here), professional wrestlers Goldberg, Steve Austin, and Kevin Nash, James Cromwell (a good actor in a bad role), Tracy Morgan (one of the few funny elements), nicholas turturro (not so funny), Chris Rock and Brian Bosworth(it's enough to say that if they didn't make bad movies he wouldn't have any work). Chris Rock as the inmate with a reputation as a pushover known as Caretaker generates some of the only funny lines in the film. If they used him more this might have gone better. The plot, such as it is, seems to have been written by three people (it kind of was - check IMDB) who didn't bother to talk to each other about what they had written. As it stands the movie starts out as a bad comedy about a guy in prison, moves into drama about inmates playing football to get revenge on sadistic guards, never mind the fact that nobody is likely to get paroled, and ends as pure sporting event with an entire 40 minutes plus featuring the main event. The game itself involves plays that could never be considered legal in the NFL, although Paul Crewe is supposed to have been an ex-pro, and it ends so abruptly that you wonder why there wasn't more of a payoff at the end. But i've said enough- Sandler had his shot andhe chose to coast instead of making it something better - he should try something new more often that he does and it hurts career to ignore those possibilities. Burt Reynolds can do what he wants though, at least he earned it.
B00064WSNW|5.0|When Adrian Belew joined this band, he made it fantastic.  Fripp sure can pick 'em!  Bill Bruford is still great on the skins, and if you want to try and pick a favorite song, go ahead and listen to the disc about a million times, then flip a coin twice as many times and then throw a dart at the song list.  You'll change your mind anyway.  It's a great album from a dynomite band.
B00006EXL5|5.0|this cd is amazing. i love it. <br /> <br />but i find it odd that there was more profanity in this one than revenge, yet revenge got slapped with a parental advisory label and this one didn't? eh well. it's amazing. unfortunately *sob* i found them through 'i'm not okay' but after listening to this one i wish i had heard of them before that. amazing cd, worth the money for sure.
068485743X|5.0|This was the first book I read after deciding to write professionally. I doubt there could be a better book for a brand new writer. <br /> <br />Apparently many, many years ago if you had a good idea and wrote a story around it. A publisher would snap it up and put an editor to work polishing your work. Nowdays nothing is further from the truth unless you are a top tier author with many millions that buy whatever you write. <br /> <br />Even now people tell me not to sweat the spelling, grammar etc. \\"Doesn't the publisher fix that for you?\\" Not unless you are Koontz. <br /> <br />This book set me on the right path to become a published author. The rest is up to me.
0142001104|5.0|I first picked up this book casually because I was intrigued by its title, and because  I  was trying to deal with a number of difficult issues that hit me all in a short space of time.  After reading through it, I realized it was not just one more \\"pop psychology\\" self-help book--but rather, it is a unique and potentially transformative book.  It spoke personally to me and to members of my family (all musicians)--and over the past six months, I have purchased and given more than 20 copies of this book as gifts to friends, family and business colleagues.<br /><br />The practices in this book are so much needed now by both kids and adults in a time where there's much too much \\"binary\\" thinking going on all over the world (and all too often, not even mindful thinking, at that).  The examples that both Roz and Benjamin Zander bring from their own practices, especially those of Ben Zander as both a teacher at the New England Conservatory and as music director/conductor of both the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and multiple youth orchestras, are wonderful...and often, inspirational.  Anyone who has ever felt limited in their own views of what is possible (and that's just about all of us) can benefit from the stories and practices outlined in this book.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough:  The best review comment I can give it is that it's the book I wish I had been able to write, but since I didn't, I'll keep giving it to those I work with and care about.
0064430227|5.0|I can remember reading this when I was younger. And loving it. A fantastic childrens book, one that never gets old no matter how often you read it. <br /> <br />Just seeing this makes me want to go look for my old copy.
B00005JNTV|3.0|Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance you have of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voiceover narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but are instead distracted by a never-ending string of \\"hard boiled\\" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed truly to capture them. These could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - nor himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page, he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual style. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film that's technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core.  And violent. Violence is justifiable in the context of a story, but this whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity and meaning.  And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it.  Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it, nor refresh it by flipping it into an unexpected context (as Rian Johnson did so effectively with \\"Brick\\".).  Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love.  But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take that claim seriously.cked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it, nor refresh it by flipping it into an unexpected context (as Rian Johnson did so effectively with \\"Brick\\".).

0784011680|5.0|We live in a time when actors have their faces, butts, chests, and legs, digitally improved for the movies.  Chaplin had none of those tools and was on the ground floor of the movie industry.  This picture shows the genious Chaplin on the cutting edge.  Some actors can barely say their lines today, while Chaplin directed, acted, did choreography, and even wrote and sometimes played the music for his movies.  The greatest hollywood talent of all time; it's not close.  The movie of course spent more time talking about his private life which also was very interesting for the public.  It talked about his love for young women and his court battle with the famous paternity case.  At that time even with a blood test, the court wrongly said that Chaplin was the father of a child from a deranged ex when he was not.  He was forced to pay child support.  It was a landmark case.  Robert Downey Jr. was amazing and stayed dedicated to Chaplin while his family watched on during filming.  It showed the best and worst of him.  Like the movie &#34;Hoffa&#34;, a fictitional character; which wasn't needed; was used during the film and it slightly clouded up the story.  It also talked about his relationship with J. Edgar hoover and the night they became enemies.  Chaplin was also ahead of his time hating the Nazi's when in the 30's many Americans admired them.  From his terrible childhood as a poor English kid with a loving brother and a mother who was losing her mind, to the great break in the &#34;flickers&#34;.  I watch it all of the time and am now a Chaplin fan.  I've never had anyone that I've recommended it to not like it.
B00005JNJT|5.0|For years if you wanted to see a good Batman movie, you watched either the original Tim Burton movies or the excellent animated movies (you skipped the last two live action movies all together).  Finally, Batman has been made the way it should have been.  Batman Begins puts Batman into the real world, while at the same time perfectly capturing the mystique of the comic.  Congratulations Christopher Nolan.  First the casting of Christian Bale was right on.  I've seen Bale in many pictures from Shakespeare to psycho, so I was confident he would do a good job, but he did better than expected.  He captured the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly.  The rage that shows on his face is at times totally intense, but he easily plays the fop (the scene where he pretends to be drunk is fantastic).  This movie dazzles in its simplicity.  The story is strong,the special affects are not overdone and the acting is perfect.  Plus it sets up perfectly for a sequal.  Well done all involved.
B00004Z400|5.0|well lets see...like most people who \\"got\\" into the deftones, i started with this album. the track, \\"digital bath\\", was the song i fell into. <br /> <br />over time you start to define your musical tastes, and catagorize albums by favorites and least favorites. unless you just stick with the radio as your musical guide. COME ON PEOPLE, TRY AND READ ABOUT MUSIC SOMETIMES!!!  <br /> <br />this album ranks in my top 5. first is the smashing pumpkins \\"melon colie and the infinite sadness\\", second is U2 \\"the joshua tree\\", third is radiohead's masterpiece, \\"ok computer\\", deftones are fourth, and in fifth place is rage against the machines 2nd album \\"evil empire\\". <br /> <br />why state my passions over this review? well i just wanted to state my love for this work of ART. <br /> <br />everybody has \\"their\\" album to hold onto during those \\"years\\" that we all remember. i got this when i was in 11th grade, and played it to death. every song is great, and the atmosperic music makes me feel at ease.  <br /> <br />i love music that scorches across soundscapes, and engulphs the listener into eternal bliss. bands that come to mind in this catagory are, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, SONIC YOUTH, RADIO HEAD, TOOL, TV ON THE RADIO, SMASHING PUMKINS, ECHO AND THE BUNNY MEN, U2, PINK FLOYD, and even THE BEACH BOYS with their masterpiece \\"pet sounds\\". <br /> <br />the wall of sound is great, and the flow takes you over the hills, and far away. (zeppelin pun intended) <br /> <br />you feel something when you put this album on with big headphones and just space out. <br /> <br />since i love this band so much i went back and purchased their catalogue. this is still my favorite album by them, just because of the nakedness and the attitude of not really caring about the evil nu-metal trend at the time or about making a hit, which it became. <br /> <br />on the label of nu-metal, i will only say this. the deftones came out when the stuff was popular. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't call them nu-metal. the don't rap and the don't cry about disfunctional lifestyles. they are not korn and deffinitly not limp biscuit. <br /> <br />this band is seriously underated, just like sevendust or scatter the ashes. <br /> <br />they were ahead of their time, since all this emo/metalcore/hardcore/vans warped tour/ozzfest crowd stuff, that is popular right now, sounds like the deftones.  <br /> <br />who didn't like poison the well's  last album? those old school hardcore kids didn't. they couldn't place their new sound. well poison the well were showing their love for the deftones. <br /> <br />finch, glassjaw, poison the well, thursday, thrice, and almost every emo/screemo/metalcore/hardcore/mtv band, owe something to the deftones. <br /> <br />i love this band, and will always love them, no matter what they do. <br /> <br />heck, i hope they do a radiohead, and totally change their sound and landscapes. <br /> <br />i wish them the best of luck. <br /> <br />
B00005JOGE|5.0|Anyone who saw the July 2nd Live 8 shows was undoubtedly extremely disappointed by MTV and VH1's coverge of the show. They hardly showed any full performances since the veejays kept cutting them off (they even managed to cut off Pink Floyd) and didn't show about half the acts (I wasted eight hours of my life waiting to see Duran Duran, Def Leppard and Motley Crue, none of whom were shown). Hopefully, they will release the full shows on dvd, and if they have to cut any performances out, make it Green Day's version of \\"We Are The Champions\\". Now that was awful. I will be buying this when it is released.
B00067BBQE|3.0|The rapid editing in this video is a shame, and totally uncalled for. If you want to see GREAT concert editing, (and camerawork) watch the best one I have seen yet: <br /> <br />Pat Benatar Live In New Haven. <br /> <br />ALL concert videos should be judged using the Benatar concert as a reference.  <br />
B00006JDS4|5.0|I'm not going to go over the plot. It's pretty much a rape victim's nightmare times 3. High on exploitation with 3 brutal rape scenes and some very gruesome revenge sequences but it all feels so real. These no holds barred scenes make it oh so real which was probably the director's intention. To show the true brutallity of rape. If you find these scenes stimulating you have some real issues. They leave you with a total feeling of disgust. I alway have had an eye for cinematography and camera use and I Spit on Your Grave makes good use of these with a skilled eye by the director. It's really much better in this regard than Last House on the Left. Which looked like it was filmed by high school kids. I thought Camille Keaton had a presence well worth the price. When I purchased this on DVD, I was expecting some cheap movie with one of those lousy 70's soundtracks but what made this film more effective was the haunting silence during the rape scenes so all you hear is the screams of the woman.  And again, the camera work is exquisite. Not everyone will have the stomach for the plot, but it is actually a well made movie. Buy the special millenium edition. It has some very good commentaries from a denounced movie critic and the director.
0099450259|2.0|I bought this book because of all the great reviews attached to it. However, I just finished it and I can't be but disappointed at it. It is a well researched book indeed, with all its maths and logic problem, but that is basically it. I didn't find it insightful in any way. I guess the way it was written was boring.<br />A good book leaves emptiness in your life after you finish it, this one hasn't!

B000002NJS|5.0|And completely deserving of the Grammy win for Pop Album of the Year. The songwriting is top notch ( Madonna here teams up again with frequent early collaborator Pat Leonard on a few of the best songs ). William Orbit's production is state of the art techno, with a warmth and subtlety missing from most of that genre's offerings. Madonna's lyrics are more mature, more focused and more rewarding than any she has done before or since. And this cd captures her most assured and most confident singing ever. A complete triumph, and the perfect balance between art and commerce. Even the  album cuts are stunning   ( the ballad \\"Little Star\\",  written for her daughter,  is perhaps the album's shining moment, and the opening track \\"Drowned World\\" is a touching lament on the loss of true love and companionship in the face of worldwide fame .) Taken as a whole, in a critical sense, this is Madonna's finest moment. Unfortunately, she hasn't released anything near as good since then. But I have faith that something will strike a nerve in her that will bring out the kind of greatness found here. If you are not a Madonna fan, if you  are put off by her sometimes outrageous antics or her public persona,  and don't have Ray of Light, you will be pleasantly surprised  when you hear it. A few of the songs grab you immediately ( the first single, a Pat Leonard collaboartion called Frozen, is one of her best singles EVER ) and a few will take a while to sink in ( \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" features backing vocals from Donna and Nicky, her backing on many of her best latter day hits, from Vogue to Deeper and Deeper, and SHOULD have been a huge hit single, but I think that one was held back by the deliberately and self conciously weird vieo that promoted it.) Get Ray of Light. It will put a smile on your face, it will put your feet in motion, and it'll make you think a little bit along the way. Very Highly Recommended.
0380002930|5.0|I am typically more of a fan of fantasy style stories, so when a good friend recommended that I pick up a 500 page book about rabbits, naturally I was more than a little skeptical.  I figured it was some children's story, and the foreward seems to allude to that as well, but at 500 pages and no \\"Harry Potter\\" in the title, I don't think many kids pick it up.  After finishing the book, I couldn't agree more that this is indeed a must-read.  As the book reached its climax, I couldn't put it down.  For any fiction fan in the mood for a change of scenery, this book is a very safe bet.
B000002LOE|2.0|I remember it like it was yesterday. Working as a DJ for a small Georgia college radio station, I opened up this package, put it in the cd player , and was blown away by \\"Losing My Religion\\". I promptly told the radio programmer ( a stuffy, uptight 60 something year old man who wouldn't have known a hit if it bit him on the ass ) \\"Listen up - you better put this in rotation, and fast, because once this hits pop radio, it'll be HUGE and REM will no longer be college radio darlings.\\"  I was right. This is REM's best known song, and rightly so. More hooks than you can shake a stick at. Wonderful production, very rootsy without sounding hokey or old fashioned. And a mandolin, for God's sake, features prominantly. A great video, if that has anything to do with the quality of a song ( I'm not convinced it does, but it is icing on the cake , so to speak.)  The remainder of this album, unfortunately, is saddled by novelty songs ( Shiny Happy People, anyone? I thought not) jokey duets ( the KRS One collaboration is laughable) and a few half baked ideas diguised as songs. It seems they shot their wad on the one brilliant song and hoped it would carry a rather mediocre album.  By all means, buy the recent greatest hits collection for the single, and leave his one where it rightly belongs - in the bins.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|\\"May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds.\\" Thus spoke Agamemnon at the start of this film, yet his words are strangely applicable to all men regardless of the age in which they were born. The same can be said of the epics of Homer. The working title of this film was The Illiad, but there are some major departures between the landmark of literature and the script from which the movie was made. Without the gods as characters, a great deal of the story loses its meaning. Furthermore, a \\"war, what is it good for?\\" angle has been introduced and instilled within the characters. In my humble opinion, such a stance concerning battles and death is strikingly misguided in relation to those who lived in the classical world. Sons and husbands dying was a daily occurrence, and many of the conversations in this movie are more reflective of twentieth century therapism than anything to do with the Greeks or Trojans.<br /><br />However, despite one's historical objections to the interjections made by the characters in the name of our times, Troy is a very entertaining movie. Its 2+ hours float by, and I can't recall a film that was so pretty. That sounds condescending but it isn't. Its colors are vivid, and the views engaging. It pleases regardless of how disjointed the narrative may be. As for Brad Pitt as Achilles, if you ask me, he is the best part of the movie. I know some people won't buy him in such a role, but I was quite impressed. He won his acting bona fides with me years ago in Kalifornia and stood out in Snatch as well. Additionally, I thought Sean Bean as Odysseus was outstanding.
B000002MG1|5.0|\\"Drive\\"  \\"Everybody Hurts\\"  \\"Nightswimming\\" \\"Man on the Moon\\" \\"Try Not to Breathe\\"  There is a wealth of top rate matrial on this album, surely one of the most consistantly rewarding REM albums out there. Just when you thought REM hadn't anything left to say, and no good way of saying it, they come out with Automatic For the People, and just NAIL it. Everything falls right into place. The songwriting is spot on, the performances are full of passion and conviction, as if they knew they were on to something brilliant. The production is fully layered, with  nice subtle touches of string arrangements courtesy of legendary Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. My third favourite REM release. Newcomers to the band should definitely give this one a try. You could do a whole lot worse.
B00003CX9E|4.0|I've seen Citizen Kane three times now, and there is no question that its arrival in Hollywood had to be greeted with the same kind of bewilderment one would expect from going back in time and giving the Incas a microwave. Its technological advancements are notable as the artistic talents of the director still us dazzle today. The choice of camera angles, the settings for the scenes, and the entire idea of a film-long treatment of a man's psychological makeup illustrates just how innovative and unique this classic is. The \\"rosebud\\" mystery holds our attention throughout. Outside of the film itself, the history of its production and release is nearly as interesting as what transpires on the screen. Frankly, I was surprised that Hearst did not sue Orson Welles for defamation, but then I read an article showcasing all the differences between the life of W. Randolph Hearst and those of Charles Foster Kane; so now I'm not sure what to think about the controversy. Anyway, it adds another level of allure to this masterpiece.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a powerful film that deserves to be studied for another century or more. I  recommend it, but, in my opinion, it is not close to being the greatest film of all time. Although its worth is undeniable, I can only place it in my Top 30 list. It manages to be brilliant and overrated, which is as difficult and unprecedented a combination as there may be. Others from the period, like Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon outshine the Welles effort.
1573223026|5.0|I think that if you are going to read Hornby, you should start with High Fidelity, but A Long Way Down is my favorite (Note: I have not yet read About a Boy). Hilarious, touching, and featuring masterful characterization.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|&quot;Love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you&quot;<br />I have been listening to this CD every day for the past two weeks and I'm just in love with it.  The songs on Back to Bedlam are beautiful, emotional, honest, and touching.  If you're a fan of the song &quot;You're Beautiful&quot;, you won't be disappointed with &quot;Goodbye My Lover&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, and &quot;Cry&quot;.  &quot;No Bravery&quot; is an insightful song about war and  &quot;Wisemen&quot; is truly a wise song.  &quot;So Long Jimmy&quot; is a lighter, more upbeat sounding song.  All the songs sound great (there are no &quot;filler&quot; songs on this album) and the lyrics are intelligent.  I have heard other people say that his voice takes a little getting used to, and having had my friends listen to the album, I would have to agree.  His sound reminds me a little of Keane, Coldplay, and Damien Rice, although I don't really want to compare JB to anyone else. <br />Get this CD, you won't be disappointed!
B00008YLV2|2.0|After watching this movie, you'd wonder how any barking-mad political conservative could complain of a pro-liberal/anti-conservative/anti-government/anti-big bidness/anti-military/anti-God's Will bias in Hollywood. <br />Europeans used to be fond of saying, and not without some justification, \\"To Americans war is just a John Wayne movie\\". But times have changed, the Duke's long dead, and what with Arnold as Hizzonor the Gubner in California and Clint having lost a step or two, whatcha gonna do? Well...fill the screen with muscular non-entities who look good in camo-gear, add a lot of pyrotechnics, throw in some foreign (read: non-white) devils to kill, tag on \\"Based On A True Story\\", and wrap it in Old Glory. Supposedly, this thing won a couple Oscars. Changing times, I guess. <br />If, like many True Americans, you remain caught up in the rampant militarism and government-sponsored xenophobia of post-9/11, you'll love this movie. If not, you'll probably dismiss it as shameless sucking up to the Pentagon and The Powers That Be. And since this IS America, you have every right to that opinion. For now.
0780626966|5.0|I bought this boxset about 5years ago now, & i am still very happy with them. I just wish ALL of the Elm Street films had a lot of extra Special Features on them. I wish Elm Street 1 had the same Special Features the Elite Video VHS Version had, that had an extra video cassette with heaps of features including deleted scenes. The 8th disc is a little puzzling to walkthru but fun nonethless. Also i wish they were all in 2:35:1 Widescreen Format. Other than that, these are in my top 3 favorite horror movies list. Love these films so much. I can't understand why they are not released in Australia on DVD yet.

B000000WA2|4.0|Of Blur's english trilogy \\"The Great Escape\\" has alway struck me as the less inspired record probably because of the two or three annoying songs it has in it(the Ray Davies aping \\"Ernold Same\\"at the top of them) and at the same time for sounding less fresh and a bit more designed for success than previous efforts.<br /><br />While far from being a bad record \\"The Great Escape\\"doesn't seem to recapture \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\"s innocence or to present a band at the absolute top of their game as \\"Parklife\\"did.<br /><br />But all this is forgotten in the presence of the several cuts that do honor their name.And they're not as few as one might think since there's about 8-9 songs that are actually compelling and, as usual with Blur, fun to listen to(Stereotypes,Entertain me,He thought of Cars,Top Man and Fade Away among my favorites).<br /><br />A more than worthy addition to their catalog though  not the best starting place for beginners.

0375507256|5.0|Without a doubt, CLOUD ATLAS is one of the most innovative, ambitious and creative novels I've encountered in years. Admittedly, it takes some time and patience but for most readers it will prove to be quite rewarding and satisfying in the end. CLOUD ATLAS is six stories in a single novel. The stories and characters, which seem only loosely related at first, turn out to be subtlety and intricately interconnected - at least to the careful reader. For the first part of the novel, the action jumps forward in time until, at the end of the sixth story, where it begins to zip backwards. And it is there, at that moment of turning that the fascinating pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place. Other reviewers have done a fabulous job chronicling the action of the plot, but very briefly and without spoilers... <br /> <br />\\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" both begins and closes the novel with the mid-nineteenth century tale of a Christian, hypochondriac at sea. Journeying back to his native California, the protagonist chronicles his illness and treatment (at the hands of the compellingly suspicious Dr. Goose) as well as the Mellvillian politics of an American Schooner. <br /> <br />The action suddenly jumps to the early 1930's in the utterly delightful \\"Letters From Zedelghum\\". This section, inspired by the relationship between the aging composer Delius and his assistant / amanuensis, Eric Fenby, is voiced through the droll letters of the imaginary composer Robert Frobisher to his best friend and one-time lover. Personally, I enjoyed this section and, as someone at lest mildly acquainted with classical music, must say that Mitchell does a mostly credible job with musical terminology and language. The first part of the Frobisher story features Robert's discovery of Ewing's journal and the latter part explains the title of the novel itself.  <br /> <br />Frobisher's friend, Rufus Sixsmith, leads us to the third section, \\"Half Lives: The First Louisa Rey Mystery\\" This isa standard, but well-presented thriller about a young reporter, Louisa Rey, who discovers what could prove to be a very deadly cover-up at a nuclear power plant. Unlike the first two installments, this section is written in third-person and almost appears to be a novel in and of itself. It is in this section that the reader is exposed to Frobisher's music.  <br /> <br />In fact, in the fourth section, \\"The Ghastly Tale of Timothy Cavendish\\", the Louisa Rey mystery IS a novel read by the whiney and ill-fated titular protagonist as he endures threats, strokes and a \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" type incarceration. In some respects, I enjoyed this section the least, but I will admit that it was, at times, quite funny. <br /> <br />The fifth section takes a familiar science-fiction theme: the enslavement of what at first appears to be quasi-humans and makes it entirely it's own. \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\" is, in some respects the heart of this novel. Somni is an endearing and compelling character who helps lift this story out of it's obvious debt to Auldous Huxley and Margaret Atwood and keep the reader enthralled. I loved her, I really did. <br /> <br />Much to my surprise I also loved the final tale, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' An' Everythin' After\\". Do not let yourself get bogged down by the language of this - just read it. Let the speaker's voice resonate in your head and soon you'll fall into the sweet rhythm of his story. It is here that the puzzle pieces fall into place. Notice the names, \\"Prescient\\" \\"Meronym\\", etc.  <br /> <br />As you read this watch for recurring motifs and appearances. Yes, the characters in the later stories encounter those of the earlier ones, but there are other interesting signs as well. For example, a temple mentioned by Frobisher makes a unique appearance in the world of Somni-451 and Ewing's ship appears later as well. Birthmarks, Swannekke Island and an animist place of worship appear several times as well. Themes of enslavement, elitism (both corporate and racial), pacifism, the role of the soul, and governments both good and bad swirl about this fascinating and well-crafted novel. As many have suggested, it is not a novel for everyone, but for the patient and the detective-minded, it is one not to be missed. I may not have enjoyed every section equally, but I truly loved the whole thing.  <br />

6305075492|4.0|\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" (1919), directed by Robert Wiene, is one of the best examples of German Expressionism. This film has the distinctive mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of that movement, with a scenography characterized by geometrical lines and sharp angles that along with a good use of light and darkness give the spectator the feeling of being immersed in a nightmare. Even though this is a silent movie, the viewer is never bored, but rather feels like part of what is happening, due to the fact that the story isn't slow, and also because the music helps to build the tension in the different scenes.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of a young man who saw his life almost destroyed by the main character, Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss). Caligari visited his town and brought death with him, in the form of a somnambulist who predicted the future , Cesare (Conrad Veidt). Dr. Caligari was intent on studying the effects of somnambulism, because he wanted to know how far a sleepwalker would go if persuaded to do some things that would be contrary to his nature while awake, for example murdering someone. Of course, the whole thing was nothing else than a experiment for Caligari, a mad doctor that would have done anything in his pursuit of knowledge.<br /><br />All in all, I think that this is a fairly entertaining film. It is short, but has an interesting plot and a twist at the end that you will never guess. \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" isn't likely to be similar to other films you have previously seen, and even if you are familiar with German Expressionism, I sincerely believe you will enjoy it.<br /><br />Belen Alcat

Although they have; being unbelievably whiney, and plugging up the channels with this so called \\"music\\", they do NOT get my vote.

0780619587|4.0|Before I watched this movie yesterday, I knew this was Geoffrey Rush's Oscar-winning performance, that Joel Siegiel considered it to be one the greatest movies ever, and that it won plenty of trophies.  But I had no idea what the movie was actually about.  I'd seen no trailers and knew very little about the actors' resume (even Rush's movies I can only count to about 10).  So I was fortunate to watch this DVD with a fresh perspective.    This is the fall-and-rise (that's not a typo) of David Helfgott, a very gifted pianist who is trained since he was a boy by his deeply disturbed father Peter.  Eventually, after enduring unbearable turmoil within the family, teenage Helfgott attends the Royal College of Music, and practiced Ragmaninoff's \\"Rach 3\\" (supposedly the most difficult piece in the world) with such determination and focus that he perfected the technique, while the emotional ride eventually broke him.  When the movie first introduces us to Helfgott, he is a rambling confused man, who finds his way back into a small Australian restaurant and starts joyfully playing the piano.    If this sounds like another version of \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" have no fear.  This movie wisely ignores the psychological talk, and focuses on the emotions of the characters.  \\"Shine\\" does not care about what's going on inside David's mind; instead, we see how his somewhat abusive childhood and unattended confusion affects his interaction with the world around him.  The facial expressions tell the story, not doctors' diagnoses (which there is none).  Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Peter Helfgott is absolutely marvelous.  He is a man capable of loving his son, but is so intense (and sometimes violent) that he can't embrace his gifted son the way David needs.  John Gielgud gives another great performance as David's College professor, who also pushes David to reach his potential, but with more balance and affection than Peter does.  Lynn Redgrave is also excellent as the woman who befriends and helps heal (in a way) David.  Geoffrey Rush is terrific in \\"Shine,\\" but the movie could've better defined him.  You see, Rush is kind of the lead role, but we don't really get into his performance until the second half of the movie.  We begin \\"Shine\\" by seeing this bizarre, over-friendly stranger who wanders into a cafe -- we're supposed to think, \\"Who is this baffling man?\\"  I actually find Noah Taylor's turn as the teenage David more compelling and moving than Rush's portion of the character.  Which is probably why I don't like this movie quite as much as most do.    You see, \\"Shine\\" is actually two stories.  The first act focuses on the tension between David and Peter.  This is very well-executed, because Mueller-Stahl's intensity opposite Taylor's innocence and desperation is absolutely amazing.  Even when the two characters aren't together, you can still feel the anger and conflict.  David and Peter must have felt those same strong emotions...day after day, night after night.    The second story is Rush's half of the film, when the grown-up David Helfgott is trying to cope with the world now that he is alone.  Director Scott Hicks makes it very clear that the people in David's life helped him reassimilate into the world, but what about David's efforts?  Instead of feeling genuinely moved, there are times when adult David is used simply as a mentally-damaged man who has difficulty compiling a comprehensive thought.  We share the frustration and test-of-patience the characterx feel, but it's almost too effective.  When Peter coldly tells his rambling son, \\"Get to the point,\\" the monstrous antagonist became my hero for a brief moment.  The second half of \\"Shine\\" is several genres of movies crammed into a hour-length.    Don't get me wrong...this is a well-made movie.  There are no plots holes or character inconsistencies whatsoever.  Hicks has great control of the camera and wonderful attention to the simplest detail.  His timing is dead-on, and listeningto his interviews on the DVD merits a second viewing.  I just felt that the comeback part of the movie needed more story.  This movie is only 105 minutes including credits.  With actors like this, I would've gladly taken a 2-hour picture.    However, Rush and Redgrave are still heart-warming in their roles.  When the world applauses David's skills in a concert, and we see his tears, we are relieved that pain and suffering have ended...even if for only a brief moment in time.  Very few films invoke a stronger sense of hope.    FINAL NOTE - If you're wondering why the movie is called \\"Shine,\\" Scott Hicks answers that question on the DVD.  But you should watch it for yourself, because you'll understand soon enough.

For people who already loved musicals this one's no exception, but it's kind of a musical for people who don't like musicals as well. No one can resist it! It has awesome music and a extremely creative plot. Anyone who's seen it will agree it was fun and interesting, because everyone could relate to the characters. You could relate to Glinda: the beautiful, priveledged,loved girl who thought she had everything/ Elphaba: the intelligent, friendless outcast...etc. I thought it was a great show and I think it has some of the best music I've ever heard.It's amazing and any one who says otherwise should be instatutionalized! I say definately buy the CD and see the show if you can! <br />_+* SilveR SlipperS*+_

0007140843|5.0|This gifted author weaves a mesmerizing tale around Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, creating an incandescent and luminous work of her own. His painting is a simple, though enigmatic, portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, about which little is known. The author, however, a born storyteller, creates a living, breathing story around it, using a singular, first person narrative. Told in spare, elegant prose, the author leaps into literary renown with this book.<br /><br />The events in the book are viewed through the eyes of Griet, a sixteen year old Dutch girl, whose changed family circumstances force her into taking a position as a maid in the home of a renowned painter, the taciturn Johannes Vermeer. There, the painter resides with his tempestuous wife, Catharina, their brood of unruly children, his commanding and shrewd mother-in-law, Maria Thins, and their loyal housekeeper and cook, Tanneke. The author lovingly details seventeenth century life in the Dutch city of Delft. It is here that Griet's story unfolds.<br /><br />Sensitive and perceptive, Griet is attuned to the under currents in the Vermeer household and, at first, takes care not to draw attention to herself. Still, she, the daughter of a tile painter, is curious about Vermeer's artistry and is drawn to his work and his methods. Vermeer, sensing a kindred artistic spirit in Griet, draws her into his world of paint, color, light, and beauty, creating an intimacy of the spirit between the two.<br /><br />Still, Griet, a girl on the brink of becoming a woman, finds herself confused and breathlessly desiring more than she may have. Her longing for more than a communion of the spirit with Vermeer is palpable. It is, therefore, not surprising that the undercurrents in the Vermeer household should come bubbling to the surface and engulf Griet, much to her consternation.<br /><br />This is a stunning literary work that fully realizes the promise that the author showed in her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count. Deliberate and spare, her prose is lyrical in its simplicity, weaving a tale that will keep the reader spellbound. This is historical fiction at its finest. Bravo!The Virgin Blue\\".

B00006SFBD|5.0|In my mind, this band can do no wrong. Mikael Akerfeldt is a musical genius and there are very few people that can match his unique style of songwriting. The whole band seems a little tighter and more focused for some reason on this album. The musicianship is as always amazing. Every song is a highlight.<br /><br />\\"Wreath\\" starts off with some heavy riffing and nice double bass from Martin Lopez. Speaking of Martin Lopez, he probably gives his best performance on this album. He always knows how best to add to the song. The guitar work is astounding on 'Deliverance', from the heavy and melodic riffs, to the very emotional leads, to the beautifully arranged acoustic passages. In fact, 'Deliverance' also contains some of Opeth's most beautifully done mellow moments. Such moments occur toward the end of 'Wreath', two soft passages both toward the beginning and end of the title track, and the most heavenly one of all, I think, toward the middle of 'Master's Apprentices'. Its one of those moments that gives you chills. Even the short and melancholic instrumental 'For Absent Friends' is gorgeous.<br /><br />The last standout trait for this album that I'll mention is Mikael's singing, both the growling and clean vocals. In my opinion, it is his finest performance to date. His growls are some of the best in death metal, sounding evil and just plain inhuman. Meanwhile, his delicate clean singing will appeal to nearly anyone.<br /><br />This was my first Opeth album, along with 'Damnation', and I feel it is probably your best place to start with this band. If not this album than 'Blackwater Park', as it is just as amazing. There are many reasons why Opeth remain my favorite band, and this album is one of them. Highly recommended.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is a charming film.  Barrie seems to have found Never Land and considers his mission in life is to guide others to this magical place.  It appears to be less of a biography than a kind of road map to what many would consider to be a fantasy world. <br /> <br />It would be nice to find a refuge from our corporeal world, where we can live out fantasies and reconnect with those who have departed.  It is also refreshing to find a story of this search for Never Land without the injection of a divinity or mention of religous values.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Gorillaz technically 3rd album leaves the happier days of sunshine in bags and cool shoe-shines behind. Not greaving the departed Dan the funky homosapien and the automater Gorillaz step into there own world of hedonism and dark apathy (all with a danceable beat!). This is a much blacker album and even the Gorillaz art reflects it. The cover being ripped from the Beatles \\"let it be\\" album shows the band in a much less child-like form and a much more serious tone. They no longer play games vocally or musically. You wont find songs like gravity with 2-d in a higher tone singing \\"gravit-a-a-a-a-a-a-ayyy, dont let me down\\". The puns are gone, the smiles are now menacing and now present themselves in a straight forward manner. What they now expose to you is a darker sound with techno overtones. The album is much more concentrated on a certain sound then the previous, with much less rock-then rap- then weird techno-then rock flow. Its all blended together now. The album feels conected and because of this give you a sensation the other did not. A sensation of experiencing something. You didn't take 50 seperate paths and chose which one best suited you. You were on one and experienced all of it. The worst part of this journey, the new rappers with Gorillaz definetly lack the talent of the previous. De La Soul can carry a decent sound but the only real inpreasive poet with a flow would be MF Doom - who gives a gorillaz sized performance in  \\"November has come\\". The fuzzed out now phoned in vocal of 2-D throughout 2/3's of the album also leaves more to be desired from the singing. This experience also brings amazing tracks like Dare, Last living souls, O green world, Fire coming out of A monkey's head, and Kids with guns. Theew all this what was lacking in the self titled album is more than made up for here, but it does not have the strengths of the self titled also. Once Gorillaz and find a way to bring there two sides together (combine Danger mouse who worked with then on this album and the Automater from the self-titled) they'll reach what they are fully capable of. This album is definately worth buying if you heard them before or not. But if your a indie rocker I would suggest the first album before going into the world of demon days to warm yourself up to such a giant leap as this. 4 stars total.<br /><br />Orignality - 5  Vocals - 3  Music - 4  Consistancy 3 2/3his album and the Automater from the self-titled) they'll reach what they are fully capable of.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I realize that's a tall order I've written in my title for this review, but its not an exaggeration-- Joss Whedon's \\"Firefly\\" is one of those rare things-- the right combination of concept and execution that ends up producing something magical. <br /> <br />Captain Malcolm Reynolds (playing by Nathan Fillion) commands a Firefly-class starship (which he dubbed \\"Serenity\\") and a small crew-- first officer Zoe (Gina Torres), pilot 'Wash' (Alan Tuydk), engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite) and hired gun Jayne (Adam Baldwin).  Reynolds and companies take whatever jobs they can find-- everything from legitimate business to smuggling, impolite odd jobs, and so on.  The large, centralized government can't quite provide for its citizens, and sometimes desparate measures are necessary.  Still, legitimate business is a good thing when available, and a Registered Companion (a legal prostitute named Inara played by Morena Baccarin) travels with the crew to give them some respectability.  One day, they take on some passengers to make some extra cash-- a shepherd, sort of a modern preacher, by the name of Book (Ron Glass) and a young doctor-- Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and it pretty much all goes downhill from there.  Along the way, they meet the doctor's sister (River, expertly played by Summer Glau) and discover they've gotten a bit more than they bargained for. <br /> <br />But what makes this any better than any other science fiction show?  What separates out \\"Firefly\\" to have all these dedicated fans who organized letter writing campaigns and will tell anyone who listen about how wonderful the show is?  What makes someone like me, who never saw it during its first run and was given a copy of the DVD set for Christmas, go out and buy sets for other people as a gift and tell everyone I know they need to see this, including finally sitting down to write this review? <br /> <br />Well to put it short, it's not a standard science fiction show-- its not glamorous, there's no incredible high technology, there's no aliens, there's no dramatic space combat.  It feels more like  a bunch of lower-middle-class folks trying to find a way to survive in the world and get by.  Sometimes they do things that aren't great, and a lot of people look down on them, but they can hold their head up high knowing they maintain their diginity and respectability. <br /> <br />Add to this a series of superb scripts, absolutely brilliant acting across the board, and a chemistry between the cast that is so rarely found anywhere and you've really got a reciple for brilliance.  By the second episode, you know each of the characters pretty well, you understand them, by the middle of the season, you get bummed when one of them has a bad day.  By the end, you can't believe that Fox was naive enough to actually cancel this show.  <br /> <br />This is really essential viewing, not just for fans of science fiction.  Anyone who enjoys good drama should check out \\"Firefly\\" (and the forthcoming \\"Serenity\\" movie).  This is among the best material ever committed to celluloid.  Highly recommended.
B00006FXB6|5.0|What does it take to make a perfect album. If your Queens of the Stone Age it just takes a year in France (where they recorded much of this album). The was the first Queens album that Josh Hommes and Nick Oliveria spent a long amount of time making, and it paid off. Perfecting each song, each chorus, each riff, and detailing each chord. Radio broadcasts throughout the album give it the emotion that the whole world is listening to it with you. Verses taste like the desert floor, while the crescendos feel like water on your dry, dirty mouth. Its perfectly balanced for you appretiate all aspects of the envirorment Hommes and Oliveria mother with crunchy guitar distortion, violent-calm solos and pounding bass tones. Headbangers such as You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar,  Six Shooter, and A Song For The Dead  make it edgey while pliable songs like Mosquito Song, Another Love Song, Gonna Leave You give it dignity and grace.  The Highlight of the album...Song for the Deaf. Starting out with a bass line from hell transfering into the childhood dream of a axe murderer. Hommes' vocals tear threw the choatic mess with extrodanary apathy and knowledge. The song makes you feel as if the storm of the rapture is starting outside, then ending in a atrocious held out note. Welcome the 8th deadly sin - the gods of acid rock.<br /><br />Creativity: 5  Vocals: 5  Catchiness: 5  Immorality : 5
B000683VI4|5.0|Having seen Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls, and loving the trailer for this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. Our two leads (older and younger) were breathtaking. I did feel The Notebook could have been edited some more since it is quite long and slow in places but I give the director the benefit of the doubt. Since The Notebook is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, I do compare it to A Walk To Remember, and I do think A Walk To Remember is a better movie, but this is a close second. Recommended for the romantics. And even more recommended for the non-romantics since we need more romance in the world.<br /><br />Watch out for the Rachel McAdams screentest on the DVD where you'll really get to see how much of a beautiful and awe-inspiring actress she is. 4 stars for the movie and other special features. 5 stars for the trailer and Rachel McAdams screentest.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Words can't describe how I feel about this amazing film. This is the only movie I have ever seen that caused me to rethink the way I was living my life and without this movie I would be heading down the path the characters in the movie were heading. I feel that this is the most realistic, beleivable story about drug abuse. I felt like I was watching real people live their lives and never have I cared so much about the choices they were making and the outcome of everyones choices than while watching this. I have seen many sad, disturbing, and heartbreaking movies, but none have affected me like this. When it was over, I just sat there with a feeling of hurt in the pit of my stomache, thinking about what I just experienced. Even though they weren't real people, I wanted to know what happened to the characters and hoped that they escaped the hell they were stuck in. I was addicted to meth when I first saw this and it opened my eyes to the reality of what I was doing to myself, changed my entire outlook on drug addiction, and gave me the motivation to turn my life around. I am forever changed due to this film, and if you are having drug problems I highly suggest watching this. What happens to these people can happen to anyone and no one should have to go through what they go through.
B00005JM0B|5.0|So here we are- T3. And boy does it have a lot to live up to after the flawless T2. But hey- here we go!<br /><br />Set early on in the 21st century, today, John Connor (Nick Stahl) is in hiding. His mother Sarah Connor who died of Leukemia a couple of years ago, lived long enough to make sure that their actions in T2 had been successful. Still, John Connor had never trusted that it was truly over. We will later discover that neither did Sarah Connor. Now hiding so that the machines could never ever find him, John Connor encounters Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). So does the Terminatrix, a future cyborg with a hardened endoskeleton, liquid metal covering and on board weapons- her mission is to terminate all of John Connor's lieutenants from the future war with the machines. Should the Terminatrix happen to find John Connor, she is to terminate him too along with Kate Brewster (his future....). To complicate matters, a T-101 Terminator (Arnie) has also arrived but is he here to kill John Connor or protect him? An answer we will soon discover, along with the realization that today is in fact Judgment Day (it had only been delayed by the events of T2), and not only do John Connor and Kate Brewster have to save themselves, they have to save all of humanity, or do they? Was humanity meant to be saved? Was Judgment Day meant to be stopped?<br /><br />T3 is simply amazing. I actually prefer it to T2. It has action, excitement, revelations and a heart felt ending. The acting is great, particularly from Nick Stahl and Claire Danes, and even Arnie who gives his best portrayal of the Terminator to date. The ending has set things up for Terminators 4 & 5 if they get made, but even if they don't, T3's conclusion is quit possibly the most appropriate conlusion to the Terminator series there could have been.<br /><br />The movie on DVD is accompanied by Dolby Digital 5.1 sound which does a very good job- no need for dts here. The extras are a bit bare, but still above average.<br /><br />One of the best movies you'll see. Enjoy!<br /> <br />One of the best movies you'll see. Enjoy!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I thought that with everyone at school telling me how funny it is and quoting the dialogue non-stop that I was in for a real treat. Everyone said that this was the funniest movie ever and that you are crazy if you dont like it. Well, I am crazy I guess, because I absolutely HATE this movie with a deep passion. I saw this like seven months ago or so, and I am still trying to figure out what people see in this. There is absolutely no point, the characters are bland and boring, the so-called \\"jokes\\" sound like stuff a kindergardener would say, and it feels like some immature teen just filmed his day and then randomly edited his favorite scenes together. This is by far the most overrated piece of crap I have ever seen and I swear that if I hear one more person quote any line from this film, I will claim insanity and admit myself to a mental hospital just so I dont have to hear another quote ever again.
B00005JNJT|3.0|I consider Batman Begins to be a whole new Batman franchise- absolutely no relation to Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.<br /><br />Baring that in mind, I approached Batman Begins with fresh perspective. I found it to be good but not great. No fault to the actors really. The film just didn't excite me much since Batman is not my favorite hero.<br /><br />I'm sure there are lots of people out there that loved this movie. I simply liked it.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|Oh Mercy is in my opinion his best album. The 80's may have been Dylan's worst era. The writing was lacking, and disapointing (although to my knowlage it was on purpose). Anyway this album is beautiful and incredibly underrated. It starts with a strong track Political Wolrd. Then goes to another strong one Where Teardrops Fall. Next is the hit Everything Is Broken. Then the best song on the album Ring Them Bells, a beautiful piano song that should be more popular. This is where the allbum becomes more mellow and haunting. Then the haunting ballad Man In The Long Black Coat, which is another highlight. Then the incredible underrated song Most Of The Time. Again followed by a beautiful song What Good Am I? Then a good piano one Diseice Of Conceit. What Was It You Wanted is a combonation of the songs in the beginning of the album (Politiacal World, Where Teardrops Fall, Everything Is Broken) and the rest (Ring Them Bells, Man In The Long Black Coat, Most Of The Time, What Good Am I?, Diseice Of Conceit). Then Mr. Dylan ends it with the immortal Shooting Star. This is an incredible album. One thing on here that gets me is his haunting harp on Man In The Long Black Coat and Shooting Star. It's a must buy.

B00079FUI6|2.0|I have yet to see more than one or two episodes of this show, so I am not familiar with it. But from what I've seen, the opening title sequence really is fantastic artistically. And I can see it in my head like it exists already what the DVD packaging SHOULD look like: the same kind of clear plastic as \\"Sex & The City\\" where it folds. And it should be covered with the Adam and Eve-type of art from the opening, like Hieronymous Bosch's art (Garden of Earthly Delights). It should focus on the large apples and the nude figures with the figs/bushes/trees. This would be fantastic packaging. Don't you think??
B000089CJI|5.0|This albums is absolutely amazing. If you like Death Cab and don't have this album, get it NOW. You won't regreat it. Also chech out the remixes available on the singles. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight remix is amazing.
0316172324|2.0|The basic ideas of Blink are that people make snap judgments, some people are good at it, sometimes snap judgments reflect prejudices, sometimes too much information can cloud thinking, using both snap judgments and deliberation can be effective, and it's never too late to give up our prejudices (well, that's how Thoreau put it).  Gladwell documents these banalities with anecdotes (some interesting, some not) and bits and pieces of marketing analysis and/or research.    Really, there isn't much more to say about it than that.  There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or original.  In essence, this New Yorker writer wrote an extended magazine piece and put it out as a book.  I think a better title would have been Snap!, but I'm not a marketing analyst and that's just a hunch!    Borrow it and pass it on.
B000059TEQ|3.0|I know it sounds very sad, but I saw \\"Love Story\\" on WE. That is the ultimate lonely woman scenario. I'm a fan of classic romantic movies like \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" and I'm a pretty big fan of sophisticated, classy chick flicks. But  <br />Love Story was just to saccharine, too perfect, which I find revolting. It had its nice moments, but it just dragged on and became revolting. But I was born in the late 80s, so you might understand my opinion that I'm not from this 70s era. The Jenny character I found quite annoying, with her constant pestering. But some positive notes, I liked the opening scene and Oliver's opening statement. I also liked the concept of how the only thing that would reunite the father and the son, is Oliver's love for Jenny. I suppose it was a pretty good movie when you're bored. Obviously, its pretty predictable.
1400032717|4.0|Absolutely fascinating to see the world from the point of view of an autistic boy. This book has made me understand in a much clearer way the way our world can look - threatening, confusing, overloaded! It pulls on your heart when you, the reader, understands the situation and our protagonist does not.
0385338686|3.0|I was anticipating this book ever since I finished Shopaholic & Sister.  The premise is interesting enough.  Over-scheduled, over-stressed and savvy corporate London lawyer Samantha Sweeting commits a catastrophic error.  She retreats to the Cotswolds in order to take some time out.  She literally walks into her next job as housekeeper to the Geigers, a quirky, nouveau riche couple.   <br /> <br />Of course, Sam doesn't know the first thing about domestic engineering and nearly falls apart.  This is where the comedy comes into play, as Sam finds herself embroiled in a variety of uncomfortable circumstances.  Nathaniel, the Geigers' handsome gardener-slash-bar-owner (random, I know), sets Sam up with his mum so she can acquire the necessary skills to do the job.  In an implausible handful of weeks, Sam transforms into the picture of a domestic goddess, whipping up all sorts of fantastic meals.  But, the memories of her old London life still remain and Sam must decide if wants to continue hiding out in the countryside or reclaim her illustrious career. <br /> <br />This book is midrange in Kinsella's collection.  I liked Nathaniel, Sam's love interest, leagues more than I did Jack Harper from \\"Secret\\" or Luke from \\"Shopaholic\\" - Kinsella did a great job of developing their early relationship.  However, Kinsella rushed the last phase of its progression; as others have said, their relationship seems a bit too convenient.  The fact he moonlights as a bar owner was a tad odd, too.  And I highly doubt he would have just shrugged-off the fact Sam's a lawyer - Kinsella missed the opportunity to inject some drama here.  The Geigers were fun, but I felt Kinsella was setting the reader up to expect Sam to help heal their discordant relationship, but nothing really happened.  Sam's third job as a waitress was just unnecessary.  Kinsella's description could have been more active and vibrant with the profusion of \\"There's\\" preceding every noun.  \\"Lady\\" Freya, Sam's best friend whotraipses off to India early on, served the ubiquitous role as the glamour-girl, but it seems a bit worn.  In these various examples, Kinsella left a lot of potential threads unexplored.  Unlike the laugh-out-loud moments in the Shopaholic series, I found most of Undometic's humour to be mainly witty, but nothing uproarious.  In the end, The Undomestic Goddess is a fun and interesting way to whittle away a few hours, but really not on the same level as Becky's forays.

B00001OH7N|4.0|The Man Who Sold The World (1970.), David Bowie's third studio album<br /><br />With a solo career spanning nearly 40 years, David Bowie is one of the most successful artists of all time. In the very early part of his career, David Bowie did not have the great fame and following which would come to him with the release of his all time classic in 1972, `The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'. However, the simple fact was that Bowie had already released four albums before this, of which the previous two were awesome, classy efforts. The first one of these was `The Man Who Sold The World', David Bowie's third studio album, released in 1971 and over time, with Bowie's increased popularity came to be seen as one of his finest and most respected efforts.<br /><br />Every one of David Bowie's albums, to me and many other fans have a refreshing uniqueness to them, due mostly to the fact that Bowie has tried out so many styles (i.e. folk, glam rock, electronic sounds) during his career. `The Man Who Sold The World' is no exception and this is essentially, Bowie's hard rock, predominantly guitar-based album. This shift in sound, which was far heavier than his early work was due more than anything to the arrival of guitar genius Mick Ronson who, just to note hails from my home town of Kingston Upon Hull in England! Teaming up with the rest of Bowie's backing band, Mick Woodmansey (drums), Tony Visconti (bass) and Ralph Mace (synthesizer), Ronson's commanding guitar play was what added the harder rocking element to Bowie's music. `The Man Who Sold The World' is Bowie's first great album and marked the start of a run of top notch music that he would sustain right into the mid-70's and this is in part due to having a guitarist as good as Ronson in his band. This album also marked the start of a number of controversial (at the time!) acts that Bowie was to make during his career. The original album cover (which is the one you get now) depicting Bowie in drag was frowned upon by many at the time and was withdrawn shortly after release and replaced with a black and white cover showing Bowie playing guitar. If you own an original LP with the withdrawn cover, count yourself lucky (especially if you live in England) as they are rare and would fetch a tidy sum if sold, not that you'd want to sell off your Bowie albums of course!<br /><br />In the past ten or fifteen or so years, the David Bowie album series has undergone a number of remasters. The first of these was the 1990 remaster series which features the original 9 track album and bonus tracks including songs `Moonage Daydream' and the glam styled `Hang On To Yourself'. Since then, an enhanced series of Bowie albums has become available and this is the version you're most likely to find on the CD shop shelf. These new versions have awesome sound quality for the original albums and come with well constructed booklets of lyrics however the enhanced CD's have no bonus tracks featuring like the earlier version. This is a shame because the remasters are excellent and it seems strange that they miss off extras that feature on an earlier version!<br /><br />`The Man Who Sold The World' is hard rocking in nature but has an essentially dark and troubling undercurrent to it with themes of madness being woven into Bowie's songwriting. The album kicks off with Bowie's timeless epic, `Width of a Circle'. This is one of the picks of the album with some timeless guitar playing from Ronson and a great overall atmosphere to the song, it's a perfect track to begin an album. `All the Madmen' follows this, a particularly dark song where Bowie sings about people who are afflicted by madness and depression. The exit to the track is interesting where Bowie sings in French over a great guitar tune. Next up is `Black Country Rock', another hard rocking song which also has Bowie singing in a Marc Bolan imitative style. `After All' finishes the first half of the album in a very haunting and suspicious style; everything slows down for this one. Opening the second half of the album is `Running Gun Blues'. It is one of the weaker tracks on the album but is still excellent. It has a great, spacey sounding style with Bowie singing in a jovial but haunting style and it builds into a heavy guitar rocker which is a little repetitive in parts. Following from this is `Saviour Machine', a track which some are not to keen on for some reason. I personally think it is excellent; a little experimental with some whirling keyboard usage but it gives the song a great uniqueness. However, things take a little downturn with `She Shook Me Cold'. I have very much a love-hate relationship with this song. The start is just too mingled and over-produced with no real theme however the track is saved by an excellent closing effort on the guitar from Mick Ronson. Next up is the famous song from the album, the title track. The riff is timeless in itself and the droning end to the track is something unique. However, for me, Bowie saved the best till last with this album. `The Supermen' is remarkable, a four minute masterpiece. The wailing singing over some killer bass and guitar work is chilling to say the least and Bowie's vocals are excellent to say the least on this song, as is Ronson's guitar solo mid-way through.<br /><br />`The Man Who Sold The World' is David Bowie's first classic album in my opinion, even if it is a little flawed on a couple of tracks. Bowie's fusion of hard rock, dark themes and atmospherics is a result to behold and this is deservedly hailed as one of his finest efforts. This is definitely an album to add to your collection, Bowie himself would, after this album move onto other styles, such as glam rock, and so `The Man Who Sold The World' stands as his brilliant one time effort at hard rock music.own for this one.

6305161879|4.0|I bought \\"Fierce Creatures\\" ages ago which I highly enjoyed, but after watching it I stumbled across some really negative reviews on the web, saying that compared to its predecessor, \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" it was really not very funny. I personally thought \\"Fierce Creatures\\" was really good and made me laugh a lot, so I thought \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" must be amazing. I have to admit it didn't make me split my sides, but there were some memorable and funny bits, such as Michael Palin [what a guy!]who plays ken, an animal lover with a stutter, trying to assassinate and old lady and killing her 3 dogs instead by accident, also Kevin Kline rugby tackling John Cleese, shouting \\"I just want to apologise\\" and then aiming a gun up his nose when he won't shut up, unknowingly watched by Cleese's character's wife, who doesn't care. Another comical bit was Kline screaming at Cleese's character's wife about her englishness.  <br />John Cleese has written a brilliant film, and the casting is superb, and even if you dont find it as hilarious as some did, it is certainly enjoyable.

Next up is the famous song from the album, the title track. The riff is timeless in itself and the droning end to the track is something unique. However, for me, Bowie saved the best till last with this album. `The Supermen' is remarkable, a four minute masterpiece. The wailing singing over some killer bass and guitar work is chilling to say the least and Bowie's vocals are excellent to say the least on this song, as is Ronson's guitar solo mid-way through.<br /><br />`The Man Who Sold The World' is David Bowie's first classic album in my opinion, even if it is a little flawed on a couple of tracks. Bowie's fusion of hard rock, dark themes and atmospherics is a result to behold and this is deservedly hailed as one of his finest efforts. This is definitely an album to add to your collection, Bowie himself would, after this album move onto other styles, such as glam rock, and so `The Man Who Sold The World' stands as his brilliant one time effort at hard rock music.s down for this one. Opening the second half of the album is `Running Gun Blues'. It is one of the weaker tracks on the album but is still excellent. It has a great, spacey sounding style with Bowie singing in a jovial but haunting style and it builds into a heavy guitar rocker which is a little repetitive in parts. Following from this is `Saviour Machine', a track which some are not to keen on for some reason. I personally think it is excellent; a little experimental with some whirling keyboard usage but it gives the song a great uniqueness. However, things take a little downturn with `She Shook Me Cold'.

B0009YA37W|4.0|Editor's The Back Room is a solid debut.  Though it's steeped in 80s pop culture, and is sure to be dismissed by Interpol-fawning goth kids, it's an intensely focused work for such a young band.  And though their influences are there on the surface -- Joy Division, The Cure, Nick Cave, and many more -- their songs are sharp, their lyrics meaningful, the production crisp without overwhelming the passion.  The music might be depressive -- or, at the very least, minor chord -- but the lyrics have an outreach beyond the navel-gazing of most of what passes for \\"goth\\"; and those are certainly pop hooks I hear on the 11 tracks of the formal CD.  And, for good measure, there's a bonus CD called Cuttings with six tracks of thrash and drone.
B0006213WG|4.0|Sum 41 are sometimes attacked as being 'posers' but I have to disagree.  Apart from a brief moment in Chuck on track 11 (Pieces), they rarely stray from their heavy / punk style, although tracks like Pieces and deeper lyrics (no more toilet-bowl humor) throughout suggest they're maturing as a band. <br /> <br />On Chuck, 11 of the 13 tracks are possessed with raw, pulsing energy.  Especially on tracks like 'There's No Solution,' we are reminded how grating singer Derek Whibley's voice can sound, but it manages to work well with the guitars and blend in without any ill effects. <br /> <br />The influences are obvious showing through and the faux Metallica guitar solo on '88' and lines like 'Just for one day / I wish I could disappear / Just take me from here' can become cliched, but it's not honest to say that this really detracts in any way from the listen.  The album benefits from 'borrowed styles' and it's original enough to make Sum 41 their own name but at the same time bring lots of other outfits to mind.  It all fits together. <br /> <br />The outstanding highlights on Chuck are the opening single 'We're All to Blame,' which summarises the album, the heavy 'Open Your Eyes,' which ventures in a more hip-hop direction and 'Pieces' - cherish the soft side of Sum 41!
B00003CY6M|4.0|The plot premise, in a particularly streamlined nutshell: In holiday-season Manhattan, Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) and Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) meet cute and, although they both have Significant Others, they end up spending a charming and romantic evening on the town (including coffee and dessert at the aptly-named Serendipity III restaurant). Despite their obvious chemistry, Sara insists on leaving their future up to fate (she turns out to be a therapist, so you'd think she'd know better, but more on that momentarily), whereupon they get separated in the Waldorf=Astoria. Fast-forward a few years: Sara and Jon are both engaged to others, but can't stop thinking about one another, so they each take a last stab at finding each other again before their respective nuptials. Knowing I'm a big John Cusack fan, a friend of mine recommended I rent SERENDIPITY. Between a parade of people phoning us and our own busy schedules, however, I had almost as much trouble getting to finally sit down and watch the DVD from start to finish as Jon and Sara did trying to get back together in the film itself! But it was worth the effort: even though I was growling at Sara under my breath for being so stupid as to leave their budding romance up to fate instead of running off with Jon when she had the chance (and was Sara so new to NYC that it never occurred to her that other people might take Jon's elevator in the Waldorf=Astoria during their decisive elevator race? Do fate and common sense have to be mutually exclusive?), I found Cusack and Beckinsale so endearing and so full of romantic chemistry (and they both looked yummy, I might add) that I found myself forgiving a lot and rooting for them to get back together. Marc Klein's script is so chock-full of funny and frustrating near-misses that at times I found SERENDIPITY as suspenseful as a Hitchcock film! :-) NYC and San Francisco locations are used wonderfully (I was pleased to see that although the second floor of Serendipity III as shown in the film was quiet enough for Sara and Jon to hear each other talk, it was still as crowded as it usually is on a holiday week). Cusack and Beckinsale are surrounded by a delightful supporting cast, too, particularly Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon as their respective best friends and the scene-stealing Eugene Levy as an officious, self-serving Bloomingdale's salesman. I also found it refreshing that the filmmakers didn't take the obvious route of making the leads' current Significant Others so horrible that you can't imagine what attracted Our Heroes to these creeps in the first place (that sort of thing always makes me lose respect for both the protagonist *and* the screenwriter). Bridget Moynihan and John Corbett (did the casting directors just stroll on over to the set of SEX AND THE CITY one day and say \\"Who's free to make a movie?\\" :-) were appealing enough that I could understand what Cusack and Beckinsale saw in them, yet they were just self-absorbed enough and not-quite-on-our-heroes'-wavelength enough that I didn't feel bad when they got dumped. The extras on the DVD are worth a look; the scenes that were deleted were pleasant enough, but I agree that the film works better without them. If romantic whimsy is your bag, give SERENDIPITY a try.II as shown in the film was quiet enough for Sara and Jon to hear each other talk, it was still as crowded as it usually is on a holiday week).

B000001ESJ|5.0|In the pre-Spirit of Radio days, most of Rush's albums contained tracks that were basically long suites. This album (1977) and \\"Hemispheres\\" (1978) are no exception. The lyrics are written adventure where one could feel as if you were traveling through an exotic place such as the lost Xanadu or traveling through space toward the black hole of Cygnus X-1. Prior to the release of \\"Hemispheres\\" most Rush fans who followed the lyrics of \\"Cygnus X-1\\" were probably eager to find out what would happen next after they read the last words \\"will be torn apart - (to be continued)\\". That happened to an old friend of mine who could hardly wait for the release of \\"Hemispheres\\", which contained the continuation of the story on \\"Cygnus X-1, Part II\\". Listening to both these tracks is almost similar to watching \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) when Dave Bowman was sucked into the stargate heading for a destination unknown.    Both \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\" are in conjunction with one another, which could have easily been one double album, but that takes out the excitement of having them as separate albums. If you're into reading the lyrics, I would recommend purchasing \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" prior to buying \\"Hemispheres\\" unless you are inclined to buy both at the same time, but listen to this album first. You won't be disappointed.
B0009W5JS2|3.0|After assassins infiltrate his secret government agency, Agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) seeks out a new XXX agent to help him investigate a growing conspiracy plot. Gibbons turns to Darius Stone (Ice Cube), a falsely imprisoned soldier who is looking to exact a little revenge on the general (Willem Dafoe) that put him behind bars. Armed with weapons, sassmouth, and unlimited resources, Darius infiltrates government levels his own way in an effort to find out who is planning to take over the presidency in the name of homeland security. +<br /><br />If you can get past the endless racket, thunderous balls of fire, frightful acting, lousy special effects, monotone rap soundtrack, Dafoe on auto-pilot, wacky plot, a Casio-meets-Steve Vai score, some shameless pandering to the urban audience, the glorification of illegal lifestyles, and the fact that every female character has stilettos and Himalayan-like cleavage, you might enjoy one of the most needless sequels around, \\"State of the Union.\\" Of course, even at its lowest point, \\"Union\\" is still resoundingly better than 2002's original, and appalling, \\"XXX.\\"

B00027JZ3E|5.0|It's hard to believe that THE LOST BOYS, was done in 1987. The main giveaway is those rockin roll poofy hairdo's and feminine apparel that rockstars wore in the 80's inluding short little tops, leather, and fish nets. Oh and alot of earrings, and maybe some makeup. But anyway i own the lost boys on dvd, use to watch it non stop in the 80's, and this classic vampire movie is the best of the 80's in my opinion. I really admire the makeup that the vampires had to wear (when they turned into vampires) and the visual effects need to be appreciated considering the time that this movie was made. Cults, satanists, all that was extremely popular in the 80's, and you can find many movies of this genre that are dated back to the 80's. The critic who reviewed this movie on amazon, said it kept getting sillier and sillier, but not really. It wasn't unintentional humor. There were parts that were meant to be funny, and in no way is this movie cheesy. The main reason why many 80's films are not cheesy, but some people think they are, is because they had fun with movie making back then. Nowadays our movies are way too graphic, and lack any plot, and these writers nowwadays try way too hard. But back then, things that were considered humorous or entertaining, isnt anymore to alot of people because people are more ignorant. The lost boys will always be a good and remembered movie. It's pretty dam good for 1987. The acting is fantastic considering how young these boys were. The directing deserves an oscar in my opinion. And i love the tribute to JIM MORRISSEN, like his photo in the vampire den, and his song people are strange at the beginning and end of this film. How can you not love the lost boys. I guess people take things too seriously. But this will always be a classic, it's as good as it was back then. And i love the theme song THOU SHALL NOT KILL. Perfect for this movie, and it played at the perfect times when the mood was right. Well let me rephrase my earlier comment about this being the best vampire movie of the 80's. I take that back.. IT'S THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER MADE. There, i think i did this movie justic because it is my absolute favorite.
B0001O3YC6|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece of Science Fiction and an interesting study in human nature with profound messages similar to those in films such as Fahrenheit 451, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Metropolis, Logan's Run, and Blade Runner.    The internal struggles of the characters (spirituality, self-sacrifice, temptation, suspicions, addiction, guilt, mastery of fear, human kindness, self-interest, resourcefulness, etc.) add a tremendous amount of depth to the story.  The guilt of the captain over her early impulsive actions and the penance she ultimately pays for her mistake are deeply touching and almost made me cry.  The stark landscape setting really allows us to focus on the characters - their personalities, motives, relationships, actions, etc.  The emulation of Jack for Riddick is beautifully done, very quickly and easily charming us to both characters.    The story is very well written, with the acting equally well done, showcasing the relationships between the characters.  The Riddick/Johns relationship is interesting, particularly their respect for one another: Some kind of \\"code of ethics\\" between bounty hunters and the convicts they pursue?  Also of note is the hero worship of Jack for Riddick, and the hero's subsequent defense/protection of her several times, in various ways, against multiple threats.  Additionally, the interplay between the captain and Johns (his manipulation of her, and her judgment mixed with empathy of him) really adds dimension to these characters and the overall story.       This is one of the few films I have seen that seems absolutely perfectly cast, particularly Jack who is difficult to distinguish between boy and tomboy - she is very believable.  The creatures/monsters are extremely well done, both their appearances and movements.  I think this is a much better story than the Alien and Predator movies, though I enjoy those as well.    The humor in this story is exquisite; the \\"looks clear\\" scene is one of my favorite bits of this movie.  Given the intensity behind Mr. Diesel's acting, it is amazing that he is capable of adding this type of \\"lightness\\" to his work. And the tension present throughout the film is tremendous.  We are literally \\"on pins and needles\\" as we watch the action from our observer position and instantly recognize the mistakes of the characters (delay, poor choices, etc.) leading toward their doom with no way to warn them or urge them to hurry.    I don't understand the term \\"cult\\" applied to this film because that seems to imply a select viewership; and I believe this movie has the power to please a variety of peoples, though especially fans of Science Fiction and human psychology stories.      I call this one of my \\"treadmill movies\\" (to watch while exercising) because the miles pass in a non-painful flash.  A special thanks to the many people involved in making this movie for the wonderful quality of distraction and thoroughly engrossing entertainment.    I am unable to choose a favorite between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick.  I am pleased they are remarkably different from one another.  I believe they are both equally significant in their contribution to great classics of Science Fiction.    J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I have been a fan of SOAD since Toxicity came out 4 years ago. I then aquired their other albums ever since. They are hard to categorize...metal, thrash, progressive..whatever. In my opinion this is they're best effort to date. I've been eagerly awaiting this for along time and I'm not disappointed. I was pleasantly suprised how melodic and alternatively hard this album is. It just shows they're amazing range and depth. The lyrics are political, and sometimes weird as previously mentioned by another reviewer, but never boring. I'm looking forward to the second half, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, coming out this fall.<br />This album and the follow-up have been a painfully long time in coming, but well worth the wait. If you are a SOAD fan you'll love this album and if you haven't heard them, check it out.
B00005QK3D|3.0|After the highly successful Keeper I and II releases, Helloween were put on ice with a lawsuit from their distributor Noise for nearly 3 years before recording Pink Bubbles Go Ape.  Gone was founding member Kai Hansen, who showed his displeasure with the band through the song I Want Out on the Keeper II album.  His replacement, Roland Grapow, proved worthy to hold the vacated guitar spot in Helloween, and Grapow contributed much to Pink Bubbles Go Ape.  However, a battle of sorts ensued between Michael Kiske and Michael Weikath as to the material on Pink Bubbles.  Kiske did not want to do another concept album like Keepers, but Weiki felt the new material was not strong enough to follow up the Keepers II success.  Kiske won out, and the material Weiki had written for Pink Bubbles would later surface on Master of the Rings and Time of the Oath. A departure of sorts from their early thrashings, Pink Bubbles Go Ape does reflect the band's improved songwriting.  Kids of the Century, Someone's Crying,Mankind, and The Chance are standouts here.  Granted, some of the tracks like Number One, I'm Doin' Fine Mr. Crazy Man, and Heavy Metal Hamsters should have been released as b-sides.  If the b-side You Run With The Pack and the unreleased City Cries would have been included on Pink Bubbles Go Ape, I believe the album would not have received the criticism it did.  Of worthy note, the production on this CD is not very good.  EMI paid Chris Tsangerides (Judas Priest, Overkill, Prong) $400,000 to produce Pink Bubbles Go Ape--the most expensive production cost of any Helloween album up to that point.  The drums and vocals are at the forefront (Kiske sounds phenomenal on this album), while the guitars sound muddy and flat at best.  While some of the tracks on Pink Bubbles are worthy of criticism, the album as a whole is pretty good and deserves to be in any Helloween fan's collection.
B000066NW0|5.0|I instantly became a HUGE Avril fan when i heard 'complicated.' She doesn't take no for an answer, she cool and she marches to the beat of her own drum. Her music is cool and most importantly real. I wouldn't let younger kids listen to it, though, some of the lyrics aren't appropriate. Avril is amazing, I highly recommend this one!
B000002W9P|5.0|Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part I and II were orginally to be released as a double album; however, the money mongers at BMG and Noise refused to do this.  As a result, we get two great albums.  Kai Hansen was the original lead vocalist for Helloween, but after three days of singing, his voice would be trashed.  Enter the into the fold 18-year-old Michael Kiske who has (as we know) a magnificent singing voice.  Kiske is a combination of Bruce Dickinson (maybe not as powerful) and Geoff Tate of QueensRyche.  And if you are a fan of bands like Maiden and Priest, you will enjoy Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part I.  A bit more refined than Walls of Jerico, Keeper I flexes its muscle with tracks like I'm Alive, Twilight of the Gods, and the 13+ minute opus Halloween.  Included are the mid-tempo romp Future World--a happy little number about a utopian paradise for us all, A Little Time, and the power ballad A Tale that wasn't Right.  The outro Follow the Sign is not a full blown song, but it hauntingly sets the scene for the follow-up Keeper, Part II album.  The production is pretty typical for the time--analog--and it has a tin can quality to it (I know, Keeper I was recorded in 1987,so I shouldn't be harsh!) But don't let that stop you from enjoying it.  This is an album that put Helloween on the metal map and set the stage for current bands like Hammerfall, Primal Fear, Iron Savior, and Rhapsody.  Definitely a great metal classic!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie! it has an excellant cast with Johnny depp and the wonderful kate Winlset. It's a cute, touching story about the creation of 'Neverland' and children's classic Peter Pan. I highly recommend this movie it's great!!!
B000002WCJ|5.0|Upon its initial release in 1988, Keeper II almost instantly went gold (250,000 units at that time) in sales in Germany alone.  Keeper II also garnered praise around the globe and made Helloween a contender among the metal heavyweights of the day.  The production of Keeper II is greatly improved over its predecessor Keeper I, thus giving Keeper II a bigger, fuller sound.  There are many classics on this album.  Eagle Fly Free is a great song with all the power, tenacity, and melodies of a terrific power metal song.  The title track Keeper of the Seven Keys is obviously influenced by J.R.R. Tolkien (he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy if you didn't know) and is very epic in its orchestration--truly a fantastic song touching every musical facet that Helloween does best.  The song is almost 14 minutes long after all!  You Always Walk Alone is a good, heavy track about the solitude one faces if he chooses to walk in the shadows of life.  Save Us and March of Time are both fast and beautiful songs tempered by the ballady We Got the Right and the hilarious Rise and Fall.  One of Helloween's more famous tracks, I Want Out was somewhat prophetic in nature for it was written by Kai Hansen who had had enough of Helloween's constant touring, and he did in fact want out of the band.  The first single off the album was Dr. Stein.  This is a cool track foretelling the evils of genetic engineering, but it was a track lucky to make the album cut, for Michael Weikath originally wanted to release Dr. Stein as a b-side.  I cannot say enough good things about this album.  It has everything a truly classic metal album should have.  For its day, Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part II was one of the best and still holds its own today.  Necessary for any Helloween fan, or metal fan in general.
0671042858|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that when I originally read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I didn't care for it.  I didn't think it was too scary and the climax was anything but.  Looking back through my bookshelf this past weekend, I came across the book again and decided to check it out once more.  Turns out I liked it a ton more than I thought I did.<br /><br />The book is scary but not in a nail-biting, Desperation or Shining, type of way.  To coin a phrase that video game players will recognize (but not for the same reason), this book can be classified as Survival Horror.  It brings in elements of survival from books like The Hatchet while maintaining the horror of King's more subtle works.  Reading it for the second time really showed me how well King reduces us to the level of a 9 year old, lost in the big scary woods and having to fend for ourselves.<br /><br />The only lifeline Trishia has is her walkman and its radio presentations of the Red Sox games.  Without that connection to reality, she is at the mercy of the forest and not only its natural dangers but also an unnatural one.  The fear of the unknown fosters many books and movies about terror.  What we don't see is pretty damn scary (as evidenced in the horror craze Jaws created back in the day) and its even more scary when you are a little girl who just a backpack and a walkman in a dense forest.<br /><br />As the novel progresses and the fear takes hold of Trishia, we feel her disoriented mind, the possible hallucinations, the remains of some horrific scenes and the pestering bugs.  How will she ever escape?  Is there a way she can pull out of this situation?  Or will she end up like many lost children?  If the novel grabs you with this tension, I promise you you will feel like you are poor Trishia, lost, scared and alone.  And every little achievement she makes will make you silently cheer while every little detour, problem or danger will make you quake.  If you aren't grabbed the story (as I wasn't the first time I read it) you will most likely not care for it.<br /><br />But my recommendation is to try it once more if you've read it before, or give it a chance if you haven't.  It can be pretty terrifying in its realistic depiction and horrific unnatural situations.  Its also been picked up to be made into a movie with director George Romero attached.  Hopefully it won't become marred in developmental Hell, because it would make quite a good movie.I wasn't the first time I read it) you will most likely not care for it.   <br /> <br />But my recommendation is to try it once more if you've read it before, or give it a chance if you haven't.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Sorry, as great as I thought T. Nakajima's Spotlight review was for this wonderful movie (great idea to give tips for non-Japanese viewers!), he made an error in his Tip #4, Haku's real name.     And as I love Haku's gentle (JAPANESE) character too much, and Chihiro and Haku's relationship is so vital to the story, I had to correct it and add additional insight. (Also Disney BUTCHERED the English version giving Haku a commercialized \\"Hi! I announce the rides at Disneyland!\\" voice with butchered dubbing....sob).    OK! So the correction:  \\"[4] Haku's real name is \\"Migihayami Kohakusui.\\" All the Japanese audience, as Chihiro in fact was, would be surprised to hear this long and old-fashioned name, which clearly suggests his ancient and aristocratic origin.\\"    This is incorrect.      Haku's real name is.. (drum roll please...) NIGIHAYAMI KOHAKUNUSHI.  (nee-gi-ha-ya-mee ko-ha-ku-nu-shi)    And he is, in case you missed it, a river god. Nushi, in Japanese denotes deities and spirits. Haku was the god that protected the Kohaku river until (urban development) filled the river and it was no longer. See Miyazaki's message here?    Chihiro tells Haku that her mother once told her that she fell into a river when she was a child. She remembers this when she clings onto Haku's horns (when he is in dragon form). It brings back the memory of when she fell in the river and Haku guided her back to shore, saving her life. She says the river no longer exists because they built apartment complexes over it (in Japanese, called \\"mansions\\"), but that the river was called.. the Kohaku river (Kohaku-gawa, \\"kawa/gawa\\" = Japanese for river).    There is a fan on the web who managed to transcribe Haku's entire name to be \\"Master of the peaceful and swift-flowing small white river.\\" (...) which I think is pretty close to the fact. Haku, means White, in Japanese. Plus I mentioned the Disney travesty for more than one reason. The original Japanese voice for Haku, is that of a YOUNG boy (well, young \\"god\\" boy). Haku, is a young river spirit, as far as spirit years go, hence he is a young boy in human form.    It would be worthwhile to see the subtitled version of this movie, as even not understanding Japanese, you may catch the softer inflections in his voice when he speaks to Chihiro, and also enjoy Chihiro's young, NON-whiny voice.
B00005JNZ4|3.0|Must Love Dogs was written and directed by Gary David Goldberg.  What does this mean exactly?  Well, Goldberg has spent his career writing and directing sitcoms.  From creating Family Ties, to Spin City, from writing for MASH to Battery Park, Goldberg only has a handful of actual movies under his belt.  The truth is that sitcoms and movies are two entirely separate beasts.  A sitcom is about 20 minutes in length and is there to elicit candy corn laughs that are helped along by a laugh track to tell you when to laugh.  A movie does not have the benefit of a laugh track and is considerably longer than sitcoms, meaning that the hour and a half of sitcom laughs probably won't cut it.      I don't mean to be down on sitcoms, in fact I like them.  But there is a difference between the dialogue and humor of a sitcom and the dialogue and humor in a movie.  From the first scene and before I knew who directed and wrote Must Love Dogs, I felt like I was watching a sitcom where sarcastic characters sit around and make barbs at one another.  True, I chuckled at some of the lines, but realistic or even reelistic it wasn't.  At times, it felt like the scenes were mostly there for a witty repartee with each other.  Particularly John Cusack's friend who is a complete stock character and offers up such witty sayings as \\"Hey....hey....hey!\\"      And then there's Diane Lane's friends and family who flit in and out of the picture, either to add unhelpful advice or date options or to try and flesh out the story a bit.  But they don't add much, even when in scene.  By far the more interesting character was Stockard Channing's Dolly, a woman who uses the online dating services to try out different personalities and attract different guys.  There's even an awkward scene involving a 15 year old who meets up with Dolly (who's like 61 in the movie).  The scene doesn't work right and comes across more weird and stilted than funny.      Diane Lane is lovely and John Cusack is always a favorite of mine, but even they aren't enough to keep this movie going.  The lines just don't sound right coming out of their mouths.  Granted, they do a better job than most of their costars but it still doesn't feel right.  With a better script, this movie would be more enjoyable.      All of the romantic comedy conventions are in tact.  You have Diane Lane's love triangle with John Cusack and Dermot Mulroney, one of who is perfect for her, the other not so much.  There's the misunderstanding and the eventual realization.  All standard, romantic comedy stuff.  In the right hands, it works.  In the wrong hands it doesn't.  In my opinion, this movie does not work as well as some of the others I've seen.  It's more intent to be an hour and a half sitcom than a movie.  And we all know those sitcoms that try and stretch the humor from 30 minutes to an hour generally don't succeed.  My recommendation is to miss this one.
B000068IEU|3.0|My first reaction to this film was to want to puke. I have seen pretty bad horror stuff but this one was filmed in such a deliberately believable/documentary style with a chillingly believable premise. There is something about this film that is just wrong.<br /><br />At the same time, if you read this review carefully you'll hopefully see that this film is more complicated and metaphorical than one would give it credit for. For example, notice that:<br /><br />SADI(e/st) is appropriately named.<br /><br />Some have remarked the soundtrack seems out of place, but the soundtrack matches perfectly with the scenery and with Mari herself; it all represents beauty and innocence, or being carefree. The soundtrack NEVER plays while the girls are in Manhattan; the city represents dirtiness. Later, natural and lyrical beauty is chillingly juxaposed with the most evil violence possible.<br /><br />When the girls are together drinking wine Mari is talking about the onset of winter and her breasts filling out. This is a scene of dark foreboding, though we won't realize it in the first viewing. Winter is the season of death, and Man's fall from grace in the discovery of sexuality (depicted here as Mari's womanhood) is a well known theme from the Biblical the Book of Genesis.<br /><br />The lines \\"and the road leads to nowhere\\" plays by itself at one point while the girls are driving into the city. The road to nowhere is the road to the city, the city is \\"nowhere\\" (when the gang's car breaks down one of them sighs, \\"Great. We're a million miles from NOWHERE, too\\"). Alternately, \\"nowhere\\" symbolizes death (the line is playing again when the parents are running down the road to the lake).<br /><br />When Krug sticks out the revolver for the first time to shoot Mari, there is one arm shot which is an exact imitation of the infamous 1968 photo of a South Vietnamese officer executing a Viet Cong. The gun used is the exact same type of gun. If you think I'm overanalyzing watch the Vietnam video or look at the photo in contrast to the scene; you'll understand.<br /><br />When he shoots Mari, she turns around to look exactly like Ophelia drowning from Hamlet, especially as depicted in Harold Copping's and John Everett Millais's famous paintings. She has long brown hair just like Ophelia's. If you don't believe me Google the paintings, especially Copping's. She's even facing in the same direction.<br /><br />Sadie is the only one to go entirely into the lake to wash herself out after the killings, afterwards she reaches her hand out and says \\"Help me out\\" because she can't get out of the water. Later she dies in just the same way. This symbolizes the inability to truly escape from the crime.<br /><br />When the criminals are eating at the parents' house, the red wine symbolizes blood while the meatballs and spaghetti symbolize blood and flesh. It shows them cutting and drinking heavily.<br /><br />When the mother asks Phyllis what her parents do, she says they are in \\"the Iron and Steel business,\\" the mother replies sarcastically \\"Iron and Steel together, how unusual\\" and she explains it stupidly as \\"My mother irons and my father STEALS.\\"<br /><br />Later when the father asks the criminals later what sort of business they are in, one says \\"plumbing\\" and the other says \\"insurance\\" and Sadie explains it that they sell insurance to the plumbing companies, adding stupidly, \\"You know, in case they STEAL some toilets or something.\\"<br /><br />This parallel is significant because both Phyllis and the criminals later represent \\"Trojan horses\\", harmful people from the inner city intruding on the pure rural home in the guise of respectability.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie Mari is debating the band \\"Bloodlust\\" with her parents, her father asks \\"Don't you feel sorry for the chickens?\\" and Mari replies sarcastically, \\"I couldn't tell you the nights I cried myself to sleep over that CHICKEN (emphasis Mari's)\\"<br /><br />Later, in the scene immediatelyafter Mari's death, the police officers cannot get a ride on the black woman's truck because she's got \\"11 crates of chickens.\\"<br /><br />The semi-toothed black woman's plot role is as a target of impatience/resentment here. It is just after the worst killing and the viewer is emotionally most upset, the last thing we want to see is someone laughing at the incompetence of the police. We desperately want people to respect and help the police so they can do their job and bring these bastards to justice. There's a similiar scene just before the killings where some hippies scream \\"We hate cops!\\" and give them the finger instead of giving them a lift. But it's the viewer who hates the hippies and their attitude. After all there is a girl being raped!<br /><br />Most controversially perhaps I will claim that there is a definite hard-right political edge running through this film. Besides the overarching vigilante theme (which is consistent with the backlash against crime more openly portrayed in films such as Dirty Harry (1971) or Death Wish (1973)), targets of impatience/resentment or symbols of foolishness include hippies, the city, a black woman, a drug addict, and most of all the rebellious daughters themselves. The police are also objects of derirsion but it's because they don't take crime seriously enough, they aren't hard enough on crime. Phyllis is punished for her rebelliousness wanting to buy marijuana and biting Krug when he opens the trunk (otherwise the cops would have found them), and Mari is punished for being with Phyllis and defending her against her parents' wishes. But Mari's death is more dignified in that she is spared the disemboweling. By saying the Lord's prayer she has cleansed herself of the rebelliousness displayed in the opening act.<br /><br />But the only unblemished dignity for most of the film is found in the conservative parents, representing traditional family values. In the end they are driven to craziness by the craziness around them... Much as American society is driven to the craziness of making films such as LOHTL as a response to the spiraling crime of the 1970's (The theme of vigilantism and the descent into insanity shows up in other works of this period, such as the much more appreciated Taxi Driver (1976)). Society was breaking down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Everything previously taken for granted was being ripped into a million pieces. It's impossible for this movie not to reflect that, and perhaps not to be a part of the violent backlash. Later this quintessential model would be made more acceptable and repackaged, sparking off the 1980's horror genre, a kind of mass social therapy provided by Hollywood.r, in the scene immediately after Mari's death, the police officers cannot get a ride on the black woman's truck because she's got \\"11 crates of chickens.\\" <br /> <br />The semi-toothed black woman's plot role is as a target of impatience/resentment here.

B0000029AL|4.0|Aerosmith's debut is the epitome of raw, bluesy rock n' roll. This album isn't as hard as Rocks or Toys in the Attic and not overpolished as some of their 90's releases. These songs are rough around the edges, but in a good way. There is such energy and joy to these songs. Everyone knows Dream On and one of the greatest riffs in rock music, Mama Kin. But Movin'  Out, One Way Street and Write Me a Letter are 3 of my other favorites. Write Me a Letter is a stomping blues song that some people don't like, but I love it. Tyler's vocals are different here than on any other Aerosmith release. It's a fuller sound, not as much screaming, like he hadn't decided to really let loose yet. Some people don't like it, but I do. It's one more thing that makes this CD interesting and sets it apart from all other Aerosmith  music.
B00005CDNI|5.0|Conociendo la discografa del grupo puedo decir que, en mi opinin, \\"Voulez Vous\\" es uno de sus mejores trabajos. En plena poca disco lograron modernizar su sonido, adecuarlo a su tiempo, pero a la vez conservando un estilo clsico de pop, que provoca que cuando uno lo escucha 25 aos despus, an es vigente y ha superado exitosamente el paso del tiempo. En cuanto a la seleccin de temas es impecable, cualquiera de los diez temas originales hubiera sido un seguro hit de haberse editado como single. Adems de los clsicos ms conocidos como Voulez Vous, Does your mother know, Chiquitita y I have a dream, el disco contiene canciones como If it wasn't for the nights, Kisses of fire o The king has lost his crown, que demuestran la esencia de ABBA: melodas fcilmente reconocibles combinadas con unos arreglos vocales impresionantes, adems de la combinacin perfecta entre las voces de Frida y Agnetha. Sin duda un excelente disco que muestra al grupo en uno de sus mejores momentos, y que quin quiera escuchar pop del bueno debe conocer.
B00000J7SS|2.0|I remember listening to this album when it was first released.  The hippie heads told me this was \\"jazz\\".  Well it really wasn't then, nor is it now, and time hasn't been very kind to this album either.  It sounds very dated in 2005; hell by 1973 it sounded pretty badly dated for that matter.  This might have been a soundtrack for the Woodstock kids who finally made their way home from the festival, but to the rest of the world this should be little more than the link between Miles' classic 60's acoustic jazz and his fusion classic Jack Johnson released in 1971 and his other electric fusion work in the 70's as well.<br /><br />I can't even imagine buying this album in the expanded box set either.  Why would you want to?  I mean I have a ton of respect for Miles Davis, but Bitches Brew was a product of its' times, and those times are long gone.  Contrary to what Columbia tells you on those stickers found on every Miles re-release....this is NOT a \\"classic\\".
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I see that several people that have reviewed this album said mostly negative things.  I just don't understand how anyone in this world could not like this album.  It's sheer brilliance!  I am a musician myself; perhaps that's why I find more creativity out of it than a lot of people.  John Myung didn't shine as much on this album as he used to on previous albums.  I love James Labrie's voice, but I've never seen this band live; I've heard bad things about his live voice.  But back to the review: <br />\\"As I Am\\" is a brilliant song overall: Fantastic lyrics, powerful kicks and one hell of a guitar solo from Petrucci.   <br />\\"Endless Sacrifice\\" and \\"In the Name of God\\" are also extremely creative and heavy songs that have a style that you won't hear on any other Dream Theater album.   <br />As for myself, in terms of the music, this is my favorite album.  As far as lyrics go, Scenes From a Memory is the best lyrical album I've ever heard in my life. <br />I guess it's just this simple: If you're a person who enjoys metal and guitar solos, this is definately the album for you regardless if you've listened to Dream Theater in the past or not.  However, if you are used to older Dream Theater I doubt you will like this change.
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton is an amazing presenter and has finally actualized his lectures into a book that can more effectively reach a vast number of people. If you've seen the movie \\"What the Bleep Do We Know,\\" you'll want to read this book. Bruce was interviewed extensively for the movie and much of the info in the movie will be expanded upon in the book. Bruce comprehensively explains through a wonderfully understandable version of biology how each individual has the ability to control the quality and experiences of his/her life.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|<br />This is one of those CDs that I describe as \\"my wife's\\" but that I'm known to listen to from time to time. These ladies have a fine thing here and I hope they keep it up. <br /> <br />I'm kind of old school so my favorite is Danny Boy, though I do like the newer stuff too. <br /> <br />I think it's well worth your time to give it a listen. It's good enough that I'm here looking for their other CDs - for my wife... <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|but you really need to get over your youth.  Yes I'm talking to you J.M Gifford.  YOu are the typical old fogey who cannot get over how great music was in their youth and how bad the music has become today.  What a bold statement you make, I've never heard that before!  Sure Coldplay aren't the most original band out there but you can't deny they write some great tunes.  No they are not the highly-experimental sophisticated \\"prog\\" (YES) that you seem to be so in love with, but I Think they are one of the better bands out there today (if not one of the best) in that they 1) write great anthemic tunes and 2) don't rip off eddie vedder (creed, nickelback).   <br /> <br />X&Y is as good a follow-up as a Coldplay fan could hope for, I was not in the slightest bit disappointed.  Definite faves are White Shadows, Square One and Fix You, however there are bucketloads of great songs. <br /> <br />Grampa Gifford I also suggest exploring music NOT in the top 40 charts before making a statement about modern music.  For all the Maroon 5s and Nickelbacks out there, there are great bands like A Perfect Circle, Interpol, Doves and The Mars Volta that are still giving the new millenium a decent name.   <br /> <br />PS. U2 have only written a handful of decent songs in their whole career, and THE WALL was the album that cemented Pink Floyd's transformation from legendary to turgid.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Action packed sequel, that overall is enjoyable, but the story could have been told better. In this one Bourne has lost his memory and is being pursued by assasins while being framed for murder at the same time. Usual espionage stuff like double agents and car chase scenes that would have been musch better if the director knew how to tell a story. Matt Damon did a good job, if you like him check it out.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This is one of those films that it's unfair to accurately judge after just one viewing, much like there are some albums that you just have to listen to a few times for them to fully sink in and make sense.  The plot of this film itself is little more than a soap opera set in a circus sideshow, and given the short length, there isn't much room for a very complex plot or a lot of character development apart from the top main characters.  It's kind of unfair that some films have such unquestioned reputations; naturally some people will feel let down or that the movie's overrated after they finally see it for themselves if it didn't blow their minds or keep them riveted throughout.  The film's greatness and classic status go deeper than the hype and its reputation (in large part due to having been banned in England and a number of other places for over 30 years and what a major box office bomb it was in many places).  It's a revolutionary concept not a lot of people were ready for in 1932, presenting the \\"freaks\\" as the normal ones, the good guys, and the \\"normal\\" people in the circus as the evil bad guys up to no good.  Today you also would probably never get away with making a movie like this, since it would be seen as cruel to the disabled.  As it's pointed out in the excellent documentary and the audio commentary, for most people who had physical abnormalities in those days (such as the quite sweet and charming microencephalitics, or \\"pinheads,\\" Prince Randion, the living torso, the dwarves, the armless young ladies, and the \\"half-boy\\" Johnny Eck, who was very charming and good-looking), a circus sideshow was really the only place they could make a living and feel like they belonged and were wanted somewhere.  They looked after their own, even if they were seen by most of the public as hideous horrific \\"freaks.\\"<br /><br />Today the film doesn't seem quite so scary, since many people are used to seeing people with such physical conditions (dwarves, people missing a lower body, armless people, people with unusual physical characteristics but who have nothing physically wrong with them otherwise), even interacting with them, although the climax during the thunderstorm, the freaks crawling after Cleopatra in the mud, armed with weapons, is still some pretty creepy stuff.  It's also very unfortunate that it doesn't have as big an impact as Browning probably wanted it to have, since about 30 minutes of what he intended as footage are gone.  If there had been no strict censorship or Hays Code, this could have been that much more of a shocking compelling movie.  At times it also has that stilted feel a lot of early talkies do, such as how the camera isn't able to move around as much as it could just a few years back.  At times it's also hard to make out what some people are saying, due to some of the problems with early sound recording that hadn't been quite ironed out yet.  Besides having the feel of an early sound film (a medium, it's pointed out in the audio commentary, that Browning was never fully comfortable with or enamoured of), most of the actors also weren't trained professional actors.  Still, in spite of some technical problems, issues with censorship, and not having a fully professional cast, it does start to seem better when given more than just one viewing.a lower body, armless people, people with unusual physical characteristics but who have nothing physically wrong with them otherwise), even interacting with them, although the climax during the thunderstorm, the freaks crawling after Cleopatra in the mud, armed with weapons, is still some pretty creepy stuff.

B00003CX9E|5.0|There has probably been more pearls of wisdom cast at CITIZEN KANE than any other movie.  I just did a book search on the title here on Amazon and came up with 43 results.  There are `Perspectives on,'  `Focus on,' `Casebook on' and a `Making of' or two, as well as a waggish `Raising Kane.'  Tossing out the strays - Jeffrey Archer's `Kane and Abel,' for instance -- that haven't a thing to do with Orson Welles' masterpiece, you're still left with a shelf full of books on the movie.  And that doesn't even begin to count the magazine and journal articles.<br /><br />  So what's a rube to do?  Any `insight' I might offer on CITIZEN KANE has undoubtedly been gurgitated and regurgitated a dozen time.  The best I can come up with is this: The last time I saw this it was a cheap vhs tape and I remember disliking it quite a bit.  The Warners' Home Video disk is extremely clean and the movie benefits tremendously.  You've really got to watch a clean print of this one to appreciate it.  This will never be my favorite movie - or even my favorite Orson Welles movie - but I've watched it three times (the disk has a separate commentary track with Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert) and I've seen something new in it each time.  Not just because the commentators point it out, either, although the commentaries help in appreciating the nuances of Welles' direction and Gregg Toland's camera-work.<br /><br />The two-hour long `The Battle Over Citizen Kane' documentary on disk two, an episode of PBS's `American Experience,' gives a welcome and complete overview of the controversy surrounding the production and distribution of the movie.  The clutch of specials on disk one - ad campaigns, call sheets, etc. - are interesting but, unlike the `Battle' on disk two, unessential.  CITIZEN KANE, however, is essential viewing for anyone with an involved interest in movies beyond the current hits.  I didn't love it, but after watching it three times in a short span I can now appreciate why it's considered by many the greatest movie ever made.ny the greatest movie ever made.
B00007LTIA|4.0|I really liked Radiohead's Kid A. My friends and I had discovered the amazing things that can be done with a simple delay pedal, and we recognised a lot of the effects on that particular album. Anyway, in a review for Kid A, an indifferent journalist tossed out a few wild recommendations for the few that could possibly of enjoyed it. One: Yes's Tales, Two: Brian Eno's Another Green World. <br /> <br />Next time I visited the CD store I bought, of course, Tales, and also a Brian Eno recording called \\"Neroli\\". The latter turned out to be one of Eno's most minimalist pieces, an hour-long repetition of a single scale. Needless to say, my teenage brain couldn't handle the fact that there was nothing happening on \\"Neroli\\", and I was naturally launched on an odyssey through the exciting realm of progressive rock of the early seventies. <br /> <br />My point in the backstory is that I feel that I could have gone two ways at that point: Yes or Eno. And I chose Yes. Funnily enough, I've come full circle and found myself becoming more excited and interested in Brian Eno, via the Canterbury family tree. <br /> <br />And here's the kicker. If I'd chosen Eno instead of Yes, I don't think I would have gone back to investigate Yes. <br /> <br />Eh? Mm? <br /> <br />Anyway, the album itself isn't their best. It lacks the focus of Close to the Edge, and the intensity of Relayer. While the double format allows a lot of space, creatively, for the compositions to explore themselves, there is almost no spontaneity. Oh, there are solos, and the chord progressions are quite pretty for most of the records, but there aren't many real epiphanies, and the feeling never builds, only shifts. <br /> <br />It's still a bloody good listen, however, and a fine way to kill an afternoon. Or a party!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had always liked the song 'I don't wanna be' but after hearing the song 'follow through' I was hooked. I love this album, Gavin possesses an amazing song writing talent, lyrically and melodically, along with his strong and sweet voice.  <br /> <br />This is the kind of album you'll listen to a million times, leave for a bit then come back to it and fall in love with him all over again. And the stripped version of the CD is also worth getting, the live and slightly alter versions of all the songs are great to hear. <br /> <br />From the funky out their theme of 'Chemical party' to the sweet, realistic but no body ever written a song about, 'Nice to meet you (anyway)' and hopeless romantic lyrics of `More than anyone' Gavin will have you wishing he was yours. <br /> <br />This album is definitely worth getting, you'll fall in love with his voice and lyrics over and over again.
B000002UAX|5.0|George Martin (in the &quot;Anthology&quot; DVDs) and others have said that the White Album could/should have been edited down to a single album, which, if done well, would surely have placed it along with Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper's as one of the finest albums in the history of pop/rock.  I agree, but the downside is that by so doing, you would lose so many of the quirky but wonderful songs that are on the album, songs that don't have &quot;hit&quot; written all over them, but which are nevertheless memorable.  Some of the songs we might not have gotten if this had been cut down to a single album might include &quot;Wild Honey Pie,&quot; which is nuts, but I love it anyway (Paul showing us he's capable of dementia too, and not just carefully-crafted great pop hits), &quot;Don't Pass Me By,&quot; a derivative piece of C&amp;W fluff by Ringo (but which is nevertheless unforgetable; I find myself belting it out for no reason at all while on road trips, much to the consternation of my kids), &quot;Revolution 1&quot; (acoustic version of Lennon's hard-rockin' classic, slowed down a bit, and still great), and &quot;Good Night,&quot; written (I'm guessing) by Paul and sung by Ringo in what is arguably the most overproduced song the Beatles ever did.  Basically, it sounds like it was recorded in the 'forties, complete with syruppy strings and heavy, roller skating arena reverb.  Again, it's strange, but I'm glad it's there.<br />Maybe the most interesting thing about the White Album is that it shows just how far apart John and Paul had grown, artistically and, as we found out later, in other ways too.  A lot of the songs are basically solo projects by either John or Paul (John:  &quot;Julia;&quot; &quot;Cry, Baby Cry -- Paul: &quot;Martha my Dear;&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot; &quot;Rocky Raccoon:), but mostly, I'm struck by both Paul's artistic range -- he shows us once again that he deserves to be included amongst the best pop songwriters in history, with songs like &quot;Back in the USSR,&quot; &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot; &quot;I Will,&quot; &quot;Mother Nature's Son,&quot; and &quot;Honey Pie,&quot; but he also shows us he may arguably be the most versatile pop song writer in history too, with &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; (which is hilarious), &quot;Why Don't We Do It in the Road&quot; (this too is hilarious, but in a different way; again, Paul draws on the demented part of his personality!), &quot;Birthday&quot; (again, Paul summons up the dementia within; I love it!), and &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; the most racous, crazy, lettin' it all hang out, doing permanent damage to the voice song Paul ever wrote.  Fantastic stuff.<br />John, on the other hand, is not really in Pop mode at all on this album, with a couple of possible exceptions (&quot;Bungalow Bill&quot; might be considered poppish, but with John's wonderfully cynical twist).  &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; is similarly satirical and brilliant, and includes John rapping (well, at least talking).  But he's clearly in a lot of pain here, and laying bare his heart for the world to see; &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; is a scary cry for help (&quot;The eagle picks my eye/The worm he licks my bones/I feel so suicidal/Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones/Lonely wanna die/If I ain't dead already/Ooh girl you know the reason why&quot;).  Pretty heavy stuff.<br />The most unusual piece on the album is not a song at all; it's &quot;Revolution #9,&quot; which, when I heard it as a teenager (only about thirty years ago; not long, really) I thought was just too strange, and I couldn't appreciate it.  But now I appreciate even that; it's pretty avant-garde, experimental stuff, probably the first time a pop group had included &quot;Musique Concr&egrave;te&quot; (taped sounds manipulated to make art music) on a record.  Who's idea was this?  I'm curious.<br />The White Album is by far the most unusual Beatles album of all, but it also covers the widest artistic territory.  Well worth having, if you're a Beatles fan.th having, if you're a Beatles fan.
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton is a revolutionary in the best sense of the word. <br />His knowledge of cellular biology is undeniable and his explanations of what actually goes on inside the cell are crystal clear. I had to overwrite all I had learned about cell biology and the way our bodies are designed to work. It was so empowering to learn that our brains can actually control our body and that we are not victims of our DNA. His book should be required reading in every biology classroom.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Basically thats how I was to some of my friends.... How can I tell them to watch this  <br />show that got canceled before it even finished its first year run.... they must have thought I was nuts... But after all the pleading they watched it and Loved it. Not just loved it really thought of it as up there with the Big ones like Trek... the 1966 version. and SW. I thought the Acting and the Music were some of the best I have seen on a TV show. I'm a fan now I never watched it when it was on TV. After the first DVD I was hooked.... Hope you are too. If your a fan of Star Trek, Star Wars or looking for a well done SMART TV show please take my word and give it a try.
B00081912E|5.0|Everyone has a movie that sort of takes them back to their childhood. The type of movie that makes you feel young again. The Mask is that movie for me. And to be completely honest--I really don't find it all that comical. Im not much of a Jim Carry fan and from a technical standpoint--the scripting is pretty bad. But somehow great imagery, fun characters, and funky big band music make it more enjoyable to watch. The movie's just got a good feel to it. I can still watch the entire thing with a smile on my face. I remember seeing Cameron Diaz for the first time and thinking she was the most beautiful woman on the planet. Haha! Its just a fun lighthearted movie and it puts me in a good mood every time I see it. Recommended.
B0000584V3|5.0|Well, I do. And it's that this album is shiny gold playing in your cd player, or lying in your cd collection. Preferribly in your cd player. This album goes from everything a rock fan can want.It comes from everything of metal, death vocals, beautiful singing, progressiveness of course, killer solos, and just more of that. The lyrics are very dark, yet very interesting. I have way too much love for this album than to review it, but I hope this was helpful. Although a lot of this info. was the same as most other peoples were. <br /> <br />Eddie
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Words cannot describe how masterful this film is. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are one of the best duos to ever hit the big screen. They're chemistry together is uncanny. The cinematography is great. The scripting is right on point. And the characters actions are justifiable. Shawshank sucks you in from beginning to end. From the moment Tim's character enters the gates--you feel as though you're being sucked in with him. You feel his pain and you begin to relate to all of the inmates. The movie is very inspirational and offers some form of hope to a brighter better future. I love it. I just love it.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I liked this movie very much, being a fan of vampire movies and books, I got this movie as a present and really enjoyed the visuals, action and the goth-like presentation.And using the film to explore race and social issues in a vampire/werewolf context was very interesting, good movie for a rainy day.
B00003CWL6|5.0|-I remember seeing this movie for the first time in grade 5. And believe it or not--the storyline is just as clear now as it was then. Lester is unhappy with his life and makes an effort to change it. A previous reviewer went on about how Lester wasn't a true protagonist. I beg to differ. Lester represents about 95% of the middle aged men in America. He is sexually frustrated, he has an awful relationship with both his wife and kid, plus he wakes up every morning to work a dead end job that makes him unhappy. Other than continuing down this miserable path, he does something about it. He chooses to better himself, and that ultimately makes him a hero. In my opinion, he's the bind that holds the movie together. He uses a very dark, morbid sense of humor that cracks me up every time he's on screen. His actions are justifiable. And also somewhat relatable.  <br /> <br />-Another thing I like is the movie's incredible use of imagery. American Beauty has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. The scenery is absolutely breath taking. And it's simple--not too over the top. They didn't have to travel across seas to find amazing landscapes. They just took a contemporary American home and made it both symbolic and beautiful.  <br /> <br />-The scripting is also right on point. Today's movies have way too much dialogue. But Beauty's characters say more through their actions than they ever could with words--and that's a rare find in recent cinema.  <br /> <br />-American Beauty is just that. A beautiful film that centers around a dysfunctional American family. It's dark, depressing--yet realistically portrayed. I would definitely recommend.
0895260131|2.0|We all fear what we don't know -- we always have and we always will.  This books teaches us that, and this book preys on that.  My problem with this book is not primarily its historical accuracy.  The issue is its normative suggestions.  This books tells us to be scared of Islam and by effect Muslims and that is the tragedy of this book.    This book is Robert Spencer's attempt to join the line of Islamic theologists from Malik to Rahman.  Spencer takes Islamic sources and interprets Islam for us and then gives us historical events to prove that Islam is a thing to be feared.  In my opinion this boils down to McCarthyism.  We had the Brigate Rosse, and the Baader-Meinhof Group in Europe and the Symbionese Liberation Army in America and people were scared, they were even more scared before when they feared Congressmen might be associated with leftists.  And surely those groups were to be feared, but are leftists in general?    Islam has its horrible elements and much Islamic theology can be disturbing.  But this book treats Islamic theology as a cohesive unit.  The mention of \\"sharia\\" as if all Muslims follow the same madhhab (school of jurisprudence).  Muslims can be violent as with Christians and Jews and every group before them and people find it easier to label Islam as inherently violent than deal with it.  Read Fazlur Rahman, not Robert Spencer.  Spencer is a sensationalist and time will pass and his works will have no meaning.  Islam is no more inherently violent than Christianity or Judaism and only someone completely against all religion should accept this book's theological assertions.    I am not going to define what Islam is, because that is an idiotic thing to do.  Islam is as varied as Christianity.  We have everyone from our Teutonic Knights to our Liberation theologists.  Islam has its societally acceptable and unnacceptable incarnations.  We must learn to discern between them, not fear the entire entity even if that is easier.  Economics will help the majority Muslim lands as it helped the Christian ones.  Hermeneutics also evolve and so does exegesis and higher criticism is being applied to the Qur'an as it was to the Bible.  Islamic thought is closely tied to where a group falls on the UN's \\"Human Developmment Index\\" and how close one's ties are to areas that suffer.    So, how does that tie into the book?  It does because Spencer portrays the problem as Islam in almost good verse evil terms.  And we do need to be afraid, but not of Islam, the issue is conditions that lead to terrorism and violence.  Islam is just a justification.  The Tamil Tigers have another justification and FARC too has their own.  You will see that Islam is just convenient and any group that feels oppressed will lash out.  Spencer equates this problem to Islam (as an entity).  This is a way to create further strife instead of resolving the world's problems and that is why I strongly recommend that no one buys this book (libraries are far better).  So, take the fear that Spencer gives you in context and think about what the real problems are and don't attempt to deal with them on a purely religious basis -- this has been tried many times and failed.    Generalization is harmful.  Islam teaches nothing, humans interpret Islamic text in different ways as we have Christian texts.  Do I go to other Christians and ask them why Moses had 3,000 killed when he came down from Mt. Sinai? or do I ask why Second Timothy states that no woman can teach a man?  No, we have accepted things that seem brutal in Christians texts in preference to reading them as a peaceful totality.  Why must we pick and choose these statements from Islamic texts instead of reading the totality?  So don't listen to apologists -- Islamic history and theology has its harmful aspects.  Don't listen to Spencer either -- Islamic history and society has its good too.
B000099T2L|3.0|This was a good solid album. It was very captivating in a sense that it kept me listening from beginning to end. The title stays true to form, since most of the songs are all about love and headache. Lots of collaborations--maybe too many. I understand that Ms. Knowels wanted to work with other talents on her debut album--but it kind of took away from what SHE had to offer. The spotlight shifted a little toward a few of her guest stars (Jay-Z, Sean Paul, ect) rather than doing HER much justice. I didn't buy the album to listen to OTHER hip hop artists.  <br /> <br />Another complaint--a few of the tracks sounded similar, which is common on any pop album I suppose. Beyonce also needs to tone her voice down a bit. She tends to get overly soulful and hits all kinds of crazy notes. Some may find it appealing. I find it rather annoying. But overall the album had a very smooth relaxing vibe. I prefer her slow r&b tracks over the up beat hip-hop ones. <br /> <br />My picks: <br /> <br />Be With You <br />Me Myself and I <br />Yes <br /> <br />3.5 out of 5 stars
0385338686|5.0|Samantha Sweeting is a high powered lawyer on the verge of making partner.  But when she makes her first tiny error it turns into a monumental disaster for her company.  Stunned and shell-shocked she runs with only her cell phone on her and boards a train.  When she emerges she's in a small countryside town and asks directions at the first house she sees.  This is when the shenanigans ensue; she is mistaken as a potential housekeeper and hired.  Samantha welcomes the opportunity to escape the stress of her life.  Only problem is she can't cook or clean and reeks havoc in the household.  It also seems that the cute gardener Nathaniel is onto her game.   <br /> <br />The Undomestic Goddess is hilarious. Sophie Kinsella has a knack for getting her characters into outrageous situations and making fun of their flaws.  This book reads like a movie and was too much fun to put down.   I loved it!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I think this is one of Dylan's better CD's in the past two decades.  Why people are complaining about his voice is beyond me. It's deeper, yes, btu it's also more distinguished. Another fantastic thing is his band. They are phenomenal on this album. If you listen to the song \\"High Water\\" pay close attention to how well the banjo performs. It's excellent. Having seen him perform quite a few times since this album came out, I can safely say it is absolutely tremendous. Five stars, no questions asked.
B000067J1Y|4.0|I recall first watching this movie with my ex-friend and I took a trip down the coast. I wasn't really expecting much, pretty much just another slapstick, stupid comedy. But to be totally honest, this movie is really awesome! \\"Hotshots,\\" ought to have you rolling around the floor in some instances. But first, a look at the \\"storyline.\\"<br /><br />Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the son of a famous air ace who died um...tragically in an F-15 crash landing and a terrible mix-up regarding moose hunting season. He decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a flying wonder. This briefly sums up the main \\"story,\\" but there are many other smaller stories including that of Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) and Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) who fights his own personal war against the terrible ailment of Wall Eye Vision. That aside, Topper Harley must find out what really happened to his dad and help both his friends and himself to achieve their dreams, even if it goes to ridiculous proportions.<br /><br />You may think that this is a movie that merely takes the piss out of movies like \\"Top Gun,\\" \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" and \\"Kickboxer,\\" but...well, you're right. But the satire is clever (yet decidedly idiotic), and it certainly succeeds in making just about everything totally ridiculous. Don't expect realism, objectivenes and logic in this movie - that's not the point of it. It's there as a satire, and really is a classic satirical film of the 1990's. The appeal of \\"Hotshots\\" is the sheer stupidity and absurdity of many of the events that take place in the movie, and of course, if you've watched the movies that are being ripped off, you'll really laugh your head off.<br /><br />The best character has to be Adm. Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges). He performs the role of a supposedly \\"hardened\\" war-veteran and a man who has seen much conflict with great gusto. It just goes to show that some vets get more violent, others more angry, some sad - and Benson just gets dumber. He's even better in the sequel, which is surprisingly better than the original (Hence the reason why this only gets 4.5 stars.)<br /><br />All in all, \\"Hotshots,\\" is a moronic, silly, yet extremely funny and witty slapstick comedy. If you like Monty Python style humour or just love classic slapstick, this movie is undoubtedly for you. Otherwise, if you like intelligent comedy, stay the hell away from \\"Hotshots.\\" It's not meant to be intelligent, so remember that. But at the end of it all, it'll always be a classic slapstick, silly comedy! Buy it, rent it, steal it today!He's even better in the sequel, which is surprisingly better than the original (Hence the reason why this only gets 4.5 stars.)

B000002I6T|3.0|Those who bought this album when it came out were either unrepentant hippies or nostalgic for a time soon gone. CSN (Y) had huge hits and all went off to do whatever they thought would be their own ...gift. Steven Stills had a contract and got lucky with a minor hit, Graham Nash hung w/girls  either he wrote about politics or they wrote about him (check Cananadian/American/LA canyons references), Neil Young  continued to write  explore and push the 70's to 80's and beyond.  <br />But this album, obscure for most, lies mostly in the temper of the times. A snapshot of early 70's whirlwind of Crosby's wandering. His vocals are pristine, his lyrics  unknown. Muscianship is evocative and definately Nor. California. India beaded drapes, bong infused, and one-eyed opened in the morning. <br />Brick bookcases and a turntable ... <br />and the the best part is the  <br />ache of Crosby  \\"I Swear somebody was here\\"
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am a guy. I am a guy who likes heartfelt and engrossing acting and plot and I dont mind a bit of romance. I am absolutly amazed at the brilliance of this film. It is difficult to name many other films that have taken film to a new level of artistry. Thank you to Moulin Rouge for doing just that. Watch it with your partner and let the love and wonder take you away.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This movie is the best comic-book movie I ever saw. I have to say this was Keanu Reeves's best preformance ever in a movie. Who ever has been saying that this is a bad movie or that the acitng or script sucks has probably never read the Hellblazer comics or graphic novels. This is truly a work of genius and I'm glad to have purchased it. After watching the Special Features disc, I admire Francis Lawrence for his work in Constantine. Whoever says otherwise does not admire the work directors put in movies. <br /> <br />Thank You
B000001ESF|5.0|If you've never heard any Rush, this should be the one where you should start.  Don't get hesitant because of the massive 20 minute 2112, the whole thin will entertain you.  Overall this CD is excellent, I have listend to it non stop since I got it.
B000000OAA|5.0|queen's 3rd album, like \\"a night at the opera\\" and \\"a day at the races\\" is a perfect mixture of music, from the guitar god brian may, who wrote the rockers \\"brighton rock\\" and \\"now i'm hear\\" to freddie mercury's \\"killer queen\\" and \\"flick of the wrist\\" a rock fan can't go wrong with this collection, also you'll find the popular rocker \\"stone cold crazy\\" here.
1567184855|5.0|I finished my book \\"Journey of Souls\\" and even though I already suspected all that I read because of what I have read or heard psychic's say, it was better to hear it straight from the horses mouth so to speak. What these people had to say was just total confirmation of what I had already heard and it was wonderful to hear them confirm it.  This author is fantastic I love the way he writes, it is like he is talking to you personally.  I definitely would recomend this book to everyone to read if they are interested in the afterlife at all.  I plan on loaning mine out to anyone of my friends who would like to read it, this is a book to share.  I'm so looking forward to getting into the second book now \\"Destiny of Souls.\\" <br />RS
B000000OAH|5.0|i think the first 8 queen albums are vintage, but jazz is probably the least perfect. don't get me wrong, jazz is still a  great album, my personal favs are \\"mustafa\\" \\"dreamers ball\\" and \\"don't stop me now\\" also \\"fat bottomed girls\\" is pure fun, what queen does best. my least favorite is \\"more of that jazz\\" but still is not bad, all in all, jazz is a great album to listen to, a great party album.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Star Wars. It really has tested my patience over the years. The God-awful prequels for one (although Ep3 was alright), and of course, proof positive that George Lucas' beard had taken over his brain - the Special Edition cuts.<br /><br />Don't shrug your shoulders and go \\"ah, it's only minor little cuts, it doesn't really matter.\\" YES IT DOES. It matters because George Lucas is NOT giving you the movies that YOU want. George Lucas is telling YOU, the consumer, what to buy. Even though every Star Wars fan wants the movie they grew up with, the living beard wants to shove HIS inferior, and make no mistake about it, they are VASTLY inferior, versions down your throat. It's the sign of an ego-trip like no other, and you should NOT have anything to do with it.<br /><br />But what do you do if you want the movies? Simple. Ebay. They're some pretty good bootleg sets going around, with all the extras and the laser disc (so still excellent picture quality) ORIGINAL versions - of the movies YOU want.<br /><br />Please note I HATE piracy with a burning passion, but this is the ONLY way to get the REAL Star Wars. And give Lucas the finger while you're at it.<br /><br />Star Wars - quite simply one of the best things ever. BUT DO NOT BUY THIS BOXSET.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B00097A5I6|5.0|Previous to this Cd, I was a little skeptical- I had been spoiled by &quot;Morning Glory&quot; and disappointed by &quot;Standing...&quot;<BR>Heathen Chemistry seemed the right direction.On first listen,I thought ok not bad- but from the starting notes of &quot;Turn Up The Sun&quot; to the last bars of &quot;Let There Be Love&quot;, I became amazed that The WHOLE group could put something out so consistent.Real contributions From Liam and other members in writing really impressed me.There is no filler on this one.Personal favourites:&quot;Keep The dream Alive&quot;, &quot;Lyla&quot;,&quot;Part of The Queue&quot;,&quot;The Importance Of Being Idle&quot;,&quot;Love Like A Bomb&quot;, &quot;Let There Be Love&quot;.If there is a replacement for&quot; Morning Glory&quot; THIS is it!One thing I found a little cool: Zack Starkey(Ringo Starr's son) played the drums on this one.he plays well- Noel will have to put up with further comparisons to The Beatles-.
0446677450|2.0|This book was recommended at an investment seminar so I checked it out at the library (thank God for libraries!).  The one good but certainly not ORIGINAL idea is that you shouldn't work for money but let your money work for you.  And that's true, if you have any savings, it's folly to leave them earn 2% somewhere and then be taxed on that \\"income.\\"  Anyway, the tone of the book is most irritating and condescending, but there is one part that is extremely telling, when he advises an author to take a sales course if she wants to sell her books.  She gets annoyed at him for suggesting such a thing to a litterata, but that's exactly what Kiyosaki has done with his books, he's SOLD them well despite all the drivel.  Live and learn...
0312323859|4.0|Darcy was such a difficult character to like in \\"Something Borrowed,\\" and I found her just as difficult to like for the first third of \\"Something Blue.\\"<br /><br />Darcy is having a difficult time moving on and not wallowing in self pity with the betrayal of her best friend with her fiance, Dex. She is sure that it was a one time only hook up, after all, Darcy is beautiful, and Rachel is plain. Never mind that Darcy is pregnant with a baby fathered by Dex's former college roommate, Marcus. Darcy assumes that she and Marcus will marry, but it does not take a rocket scientist to see that at his first taste of freedom, Marcus will bail. Dumped and heartbroken, Darcy tries to win back Dex, to no avail.<br /><br />She flees to the home of childhood pal, Ethan - the first man to come between Rachel and Darcy. He now lives in London, and thinks she's staying for a couple weeks; she plans to stay until the baby is born. As she settles in, she's still up to her same old narcissistic tricks - like shopping for herself without a thought to the child she is carrying. After a blow up, she finally gets her comeuppance when Ethan tells it like it is to her, and she finds herself attracted to him, but could it be too late, since both of them are dating others?<br /><br />Author Giffin manages to make a thoroughly infuriating and self centered character capture your attention and then your heart, making you  believe that even someone as nasty as Darcy deserves a happily ever after. \\"Something Blue\\" does what few sequels are able to do - continue the quality storytelling while also being able to stand on its own merits.
B00092QRGK|5.0|Okay. To be honest it's good to see Mariah back in the spotlight especially when she is, for the fourth week on the top with \\"We Belong Together\\" here in Malaysian Radio Stations. Malaysian fans are cracking thenselves at whatever anything to do with Mariah now! Anyways with all the hype it's not hard to question. What happened with Glitter and Charmbracelet? Why were they considered \\"crap\\"? Because of Mariah's voice! It was so whispery. My goodness it was so WEAK! I wanted to give up listening to Mariah after those years. But when her new album came out it chnaged my outlook at her. I paused whether or not to her new album (Here in Malaysia), because I was so disappointed with her past albums so far. Of course I understood her situations at those times. But I couldn't understand why she pitied herself so much. IT WAS A MICTAKE! Anyways when I lisntened to her new album. I never put to CD off the hook. Not Once! I just loved her new material. her voice seems to be much, much better actually. In addition that her music sounds like her ground and not being so POP-ish like before. This album brings back her reminscence of \\"Daydream\\" if you listen closely. Only look at it from a mature side. That's how the album is on a plus side. But the minus of this album is that some of the songs require soul. (E.g. \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Circles\\"). Now for Mariah to sing soul songs would require her not to scream so much. Yet in those two songs we see her doing so. she struggles to reach those notes. AND she shouldn't! Mariah can sing soul but to a certain extent only. Now whether or not I pass judgement or not. I love her new album anyways a big extent. That was just a minor perdicament. There are just some songs not meant to be sung by her that's all. Don't get me wrong her new stuff is fantastic!!!!!! I Love it!!! Don't let that put you all off. I recommend you listen to these songs from her album to be listened to.  <br />(1) It's Like ; (5/5) ;Good Club Track if anything else goes!* <br />(2) We Belong Together ; (5/5) ;The One song we all know be now! Loved it everytime I listen to it!!!!\\"Underneath The Stars\\" and \\"Always Be My Baby\\" together from DAYDREAM.     <br />(3) Stay The Night(5/5) ; Welcome back Classic Mariah! A Classic Mariah track reminscence to \\"Melt Away\\" from her DAYDREAM album.  <br />(4) Wish You Knew (5/5) ; A Good live track! Reminds me of Alicia Keys live though. But A VG effort!!!! <br />(5) Fly Like A Bird (5/5) ;A Good close to her album! A Gospel song to herself!!!! <br />(6) Say Somethin', Get Your Number and To The Floor are club burners!!!! If you wanna burn the night away these tracks will take you there!!!! <br />There are two bonus tracks for her album that I got on a normal issue here in Malaysia for some reason but it was the last copy in that shop! SPRUNG and SECRET LOVE are both good tracks to listen to if you get the chance! Over all the album lends a bit of all sides of music!! But you won't find yourself pressing the skip button though 'Cause I NEVER DID!!!!! <br />So go ahead and give this album a spin! It's your choice!  <br />*****But A word of warning to old Mariah fans. You may not like this album's content SO PLEASE LISTEN TO IT FIRST!!!! Don't condemn it!!
B000000WA4|5.0|physical graffiti? the white album? the wall? sure, these are treasured double albums (i personally do not enjoy the wall though), but this one really puts the others to shame. the mellon collie era of the pumpkins career was perhaps the creative zenith of billy corgan's career thus far-and this is scary good. not only did he almost single-handedly construct this double album himself, but he also made a double album of bsides (titled aeroplane flies high and split up into eps, but is really 28 tracks, just as long as this set), in which half the songs approach the quality level of this double album. from the cover art and liner notes alone, you can tell this album was ruthlessly, meticulously combed over, processed from the rawer, more grungy rock of siamese dream and gish to a both more accessible and yet still adventureous state. <br /> <br />both discs alone are 5 star albums, and it is incredibly hard to choose which album is better. each has its wierd elements, each have a commercial song or 2, but they are never formulaic, and each has a little something that'll get you hooked. <br /> <br />dawn to dusk is a bit more commercial than starlight to twilight- not to say its worse. the album starts with a piano instrumental, then the sweeping, majestic, unforgettable orchestrally-backed tonight, tonight. (speaking of which there is an acoustic, low-fi beautiful companion to it called tonite reprise on aeroplane) After that, the rocking side of the pumpkins comes back with perhaps their heaviest song ever-jellybelly. a stunning rocker, with an intro and outro that'll leave you stunned. then its zero- an anthemic, grindy and catchy short rocker, one that is reportedly very good in concert. here is no why uses multi-layered guitars and an awkward but loveable chorus to good use. then, of course, its bullet with butterfly wings. *drools* then we have to forgive, a heartbreaking ballad in the vein of soma's beginning from siamese dream. an ode to no one explodes then hits home with a beautiful spoken word rant in the middle, love and cupid de locke are industrial-style electronic expiraments-muzzle...well, theres a reason billy corgan says its his favorite from the album, simply because of the beautiful lyrics. and then the expirament porcelina (which succeeds), and the serene take me down. <br /> <br />Disc 2 takes a different approach-much more out there. where boys fear to tread and bodies are both grindy, incessantly heavy rockers, 33 and in the arms of sleep are softer acousticy numbers, 1979 is a bizarre effects-laden alternative classic, tales of a scorched earth just blazes around with deranged electronic vocals. thru the eyes of ruby is a siamese-style rocker done amazingly, stumbeline is another beautiful acoustic song, xyu is a brutal last gasp of metal, and then it goes from beautiful to calming to more beautiful-we only come out at night may be the dark horse of the set, it is beautiful, anthemic, uplifting and definetly unique. beautiful is like love, except nicer, lily, by starlight, and farewell and goodnight are laid back, calming and, well, lullaby-type songs that'll send you off in a great fashion. <br /> <br />the singing? sucks. the lyrics? amazing. the guitars? great riffs, some good solos, overall above average. the drums? amazing, great free-form style stuff. the bass? holds it all together. song structure? the simple stuff is kept simple (thank god), the longer numbers are written in a way to always keep it fresh and new (something that plauged hummer from siamese dream).  <br /> <br />this is one of the few more recent albums i can say that are masterpieces. after 95, and this album really, music has taken a turn for the much worse. the only albums i can say since then that are masterpieces would be lateralus by tool and degradation trip volume one and 2 by jerry cantrell, both of which should appeal to you if you enjoy this. <br /> <br />lets just hope the pumpkins can come back and rock again!

B00063MBU8|3.0|You know I'm sick of all of these people complaining about these genre of bands like Avril Lavigne and Simple Plan. Who CARES how they dress? Who CARES how you think they act?  <br />The whole point is what you think of their music, and honestly I think they sound good. They're not the best band out there, but I like them, and that's why I bought this c.d. I mainly bought it for their three songs Shut Up, Welcome to My Life, and Untitled, because those songs were just so addictive for me. I love their lyrics on the songs as well, and as I heard their c.d., I grew to love the song Crazy as well because again of the lyrics. Not that their sound is bad and only the lyrics are great, heck no, they sound good, but a few of their songs on here just do not match up to the hits they put out. They sound fine, but I usually skip a few of the other songs to get to the good ones like Crazy and Untitled. You'll notice there are a few songs that stand out on this c.d. more than the others.  <br />I think with this band though I love their lyrics more than anything else. Especially Welcome To My Life, I mean that just hits to my core honestly. Fine, call me a whiny teenager I could care less, but that song talks about me totally and like a million others out there both elderly and young. Thank You and Crazy's lyrics just take me as well, I can relate to their lyrics on a lot of these songs so closely, and that's what I think I love about this band is how they see what I see. They are not whining, like so many people on here are WHINING about, they are stating the obvious and a lot of people cannot stand it.  <br />I don't care if they're posers, or whatever everyone is saying they are so harshly. They're a good band, with great lyrics, and I happen to like this kind of music so just, in the words of Simple Plan- SHUT UP and go to your own music genre, stop hating!
B0002PZVHK|5.0|There really isnt any other recording quite like this one...I rememeber when we first got this..this recording blended so well into our urban environment, that we kept going over to the sound system and turning it down to see if the sound was in the recording or part of our city environment...An incredible piece of work.
0553573411|4.0|Farseer as a total work has and will continue to inspire a large fan base. Royal Assassin is an accomplished sequel to Apprentice that fans will attach themselves to it with great fervor. Yet as world-building fantasies go, aside from setting a tremendous example in how first-person story-telling should be executed we don't see a great impact on the genre as a whole at least as a result of this book. While Hobb's concepts of the Skill and the Wit are interesting, they are not substantially different from many other tropes in the genre. While the \\"forging\\" of prisoners is sickening in its way and emotionally charged, the theme of a completely amoral people and their effect on a civilization is not well-explored. The political structure of the Six Duchies is a bit sketchy in places and seems to lack internal causes and volition among its various factions and doesn't break new ground. In our assessment of works in how they will change the course of the genre and the effect on future writers, Royal Assassin has not convinced us it is groundbreaking in any way. As a book for entertainment, and passing time, and growing to understand characters that Hobb has created, it is exceptional and far superior example of many other fantasy novels that are not so skillfully executed. But the lan of works that garner our highest ratings require a creative force that Farseer, for the moment, lacks.    WHO SHOULD READ    The problems we had with this book were ones that can easily be overlooked by the great majority of buyers. That Fitz is a bit too noble, that his romance seems a bit too ideal, that the antagonists headed by Regal are a bit too caricatured, are all items of small interest to those craving a good, straightforward, exceedingly well-written saga. To these readers, Hobb will be a great satisfaction and a joy. As we mentioned, this is a book that can readily stand on its own and doesn't require any prior knowledge of the Six Duchies nor any especial knowledge of the fantasy genre in general. It is an excellent book for lighter vacation reading, for the precocious adolescent looking for something a little more substantial than Harry Potter, and certainly will deeply satisfy those readers who pine for romantic entanglements in their heroes.     WHO SHOULD AVOID:    For readers of more sophisticated taste or those weary of the fantasy genre and looking for something unusual or less predictable, Hobb will be faintly disappointing. Where Apprentice teased with a mention of more complex themes--of sibling rivalry in politically powerful families, of deeply held convictions and a fear of new things, of loyalty, allegiance, and how they clash when duty seems at odds with personal beliefs--Hobb dared to grasp at them in Royal Assassin and disappointed a bit in the follow-through. There is some tremendous material here but the book has lapsed back a bit in to more conventional storylines and more conventional themes. In many readers looking for something more than a story well-told it will bring some interest but no dedication.     (...)
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Plenty of people have given Sufjan Stevens favorable reviews I totally agree with.  He is very talented and even if you agree with what I have to say you should still listen to his albums if you haven't heard them.      Usually I have no problem with his music, but when I am not feeling tolerant, Sufjan Stevens' music reminds me of rare occasions when I forget my MP3 player & I have to scan through radio stations to see if there is anything that catches my attention.  Every once in a while I'll find something that sounds oddly nave & nostalgic of the indie music I love, so I listen to it until the singing kicks in.  Then it is painfully obvious it is Christian rock and I shut it off immediately.  I resent being duped into a medium for the Christian agenda.    While most of Sufjan Stevens' music is nothing like Christian rock, it does walk a thin line by sentimentalizing a Christian message.  He is a religious person.  I don't respect that, but I certainly accept it.  I listen to plenty of contemporary music inspired by religious faith (Talk Talk, Steve Reich, Arvo Part, to name a few), but for some reason they never bothered me.  So I have to ask myself, why does Sufjan Stevens' singing about Abraham or bible school bother me?  Are the vocals so clear I cannot opt not to just listen to the music?    Maybe I always thought of Indie music as a refuge from irrationality. Maybe it feels a little slipped into the mix.  Maybe I find it hard to swallow that the person who wrote something this good believes in something I find absurd.  Most likely the problem is just me.  Previously I was more tolerant because I wasn't feeling as sickened by the current religious trend that is captivating our nation.  I don't know if I can reconcile his sentimentality within the current socio-political environment.  But something tells me even in different times, really delicate/intimate songs about a love for big foot or UFOs would irritate me too.
0790742780|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It was awesome and very powerful! The movie was also hilarious! Michael Douglas gives a great performance as William, a layed off engineer who has a meltdown and a very hectic day. Will is stuck in awful traffic because of pointless road construction and just leaves his car. He wants to see his daughter on her birthday but his mean ex wife won't let him and threathens him. She was a character that I dissliked and I felt great pity for Will. Will has a crazy day where he revolts against society. This movie is very powerful as it shows some of society's problems. Will teaches a Korean guy that the prices in his store are all wrong, beats up some mean gang members trying to steal his briefcase, holds up a McDonald'sish store because he wants a breakfast meal and not lunch, destroys a payphone and much more. The classic golf sequence and the construction site scene are awesome and hilarious and worth it alone. Robert Duvall gives a good performance also as a cop. The movie is hilarious but also sad and makes an important point. It shows how society is srewed up in so many ways.  <br />Here's my advice. Don't rent this movie. Buy it. It's worth it and is a remarquable film worht rewatching over and over again. I loved it and it's even in my top 25 movies of all time! Please check them out on my about me page and listamia list under my top25 movies! It's changing sometimes but I really recommend these movies to EVERYONE! So, if you want to see some excellent movies that I really enjoyed, check them out! I think that you'll really enjoy them!
0440180295|5.0|An aspect of SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE that's not often discussed is its focus on writing about trauma.  The novel is about Billy Pilgrim, but it is also about the narrator who is trying to find a way of coping with the absurdity of war.  In this sense, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is similar to J. D. Salinger's short story \\"For Esme With Love and Squalor\\" and Tim O'Brien's THE THINGS THEY CARRIED.  Writing about trauma objectifies it and it helps the writer to heal.  Thus the narrator of SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE can say by the end of the book that he's now going to write something happy.  Therefore, not only is this an important book for its grand themes dealing with war, it's a handbook for writers.  John Gardner, the great guru of creative writing, said that one creates from a \\"psychic wound.\\"  SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE instructs us in how this may be accomplished.  Quite possibly, this novel can help writers more than 100 How-to books on the subject, and this is why I make it required reading for my university creative writing students.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I would have given this movie 4 stars but Christian Bale's performance made me change it! Wow! Any of you giving this a bad review should be ashamed! Even if you dissliked the movie, how about Christian Bale's performance? In American Psycho, he was all buff and tough but in this one he's so skinny it's disgusting. You can literally see all of his bones! So, you know what? For his performance and his effort, he deserves an oscar! Where is it? I thought he deserved one for American Psycho! You think I'm crazy? Well, you know what, this man has the right tone, facial expressions, and everything! In American Psycho, he was a mean, freaky guy who could also be funny. In this, he's troubled and you never quite know what's up with him. Also, I've had enough of everyone giving away the endings of movies! For all of you saying that it copied off a certain movie gives away the whole movie. Why do you people have to ruin the whole movie for us? Thankfully, I didn't come across any of those reviews before watching it! But, reviewers like you guys ruined Hide and Seek for me! <br />Oh, and this movie was not very predictable! Come on! Like any of you knew the exact ending! James Bond movies are predictable. Why? Because you know what's going to happen! James Bond is going to kill everyone and be alive in the end! No! This movie isn't like that at all! And it's not predictable! <br /> <br />Now for the actual movie. It's about Trevor Rezneck (Christian Bale), a guy who hasen't slept in over a year and who weighs barely anything. It's frightening to see him shirtless! Well, anyway, he's a solid worker, working with machines but he is a troubled man haunted by a mysterious man that no one else can see. And when Trevor causes an accident at work, things get more awry! Why can't he sleep? Who is this mysterious guy that no one else can see? All of this will be resolved in the end with a horrifying twist. The movie was very suspensful and intriguing and had me entertained all the way. It makes you think a little and it's memorable. I recommend it for a rent to everyone but not necessarily for a buy!
B00000099Y|5.0|Powerful music, thought provoking lyrics.  Original, Abstract, cool.  It's dark in an artistic way but if you listen to the lyrics humorous as well.  These guys are the oasis of quality music in todays music scene where MTV image, hip hop, and formulaic crappy bands that all sound the same saturate the market.  You see all the 5 star reviews with the occasional 1 star review.  thats the sign of a great work.  Stravinski and Beethoven also had scathing reviews for their most groundbreaking work.  If everyone likes something than it appeals to the lowest common denominator and probably sucks.  There will always be people who \\"just don't get it'.  For those people, go pick up Creed or Stained or Puddle of Mud, or some other formulaic, pseudo alternative crap that all sounds the same.  For those with music that actually sais something, and means something listen to Tool.  I rarely hear anything in the top 40 or on Mtv that is worth anything musically.  Several Tool albums in 20 years I think will still be remembered as important musical statements.  King Crimson or Zappa, Mahavishnu, or Stravinski never were easily digestible or commercial but have so MUCH more depth, that people still listen to them 20 years later.  Thats a sign of great music.  This is one of the best albums to come out in the last 10 years and Tool is one of the best bands to come out in the last 10 years.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|When I saw that \\"Constantine\\" was coming to the big screen I wasn't all that excited at first.  Mainly because I had never read the comic book 'Hellblazer', that inspired the film.  Then I saw the preview and it looked like a very entertaining sci-fi/religious thrill ride in the vein of 'The Prophecy' series, \\"End of Days\\", and \\"Hellboy\\", plus Keanu looked pretty cool in one of his first post-'Matrix' action films.    \\"Constantine\\" is based on the popular Vertigo/DC Comic 'Hellblazer', which follows the demon hunting exploits of its hero John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).  Constantine is a chain smoking, wise-cracking, selfish demon hunter, whose primary goal in life is to send as many of Hell's minions back to where they belong and hopefully work his way into Heaven.  During his quest he is aided by Chaz (Shia Lebouf), Papa Midnight (Djimon Hounsou), and a seemingly duplictious angel named Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).  When a cop (Rachel Weisz) discovers her twin sister has seemingly committed suicide, she enlists the aide of Constantine in discovering what exactly happened to her God-fearing sister to cause her to end her life.  This mystery only deepens as Constantine discovers that demons are attempting to crossover into Earth's realm, and this cop, when coupled with the mythic Spear of Destiny, is the key.    With terrific special effects, most notably the imaginative interpretation of Hell as being an alternate reality, so that it appears to be a constantly buring Los Angeles.  Pitch-perfect performances by the cast, that bring depth and reality to their comic book counterparts, and fast-paced editing and directing from first time movie director Francis Lawrence, \\"Constantine\\" is sci-fi/religious thriller that is guaranteed to keep you entertained.      Though, not entirely faithful to the comic book according to fan boys and the movies own making of featurette admits this, the film is an enjoyable comic book adaptation.  The theology for the movie is steeped primarily in Catholicism, even then it's not an accurate depiction of the faith, definitely not a movie to base your religious beliefs on, but then again it never aspired for that purpose.  As I said earlier, it appeared this one would be another one of the great sci-fi/religious thrillers, and I was right.  If you enjoyed 'The Prophecy' series, \\"Hellboy\\", 'The Omen' franchise, or \\"End of Days\\", then this movie is for you.    With the great success of \\"Constantine\\" hopefully Warner Brothers will realize the potential in this film for a franchise, especially since Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, and Djimon Hounsou have all expressed interest in returning, and treat audiences to more demon hunting with \\"Constantine 2\\".    \\"Constantine\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00003CXA3|5.0|There are many great old films that I've never seen, and I'm finally making up for lost time.  I was 12 years old when this one came out, and just saw it for the first time.  I'm truly amazed at the style in which it was filmed, and amazed that no one else has been able to duplicate it.  In the first place, it's so gritty that you can feel it between your teeth.  Subsequent cop dramas have reached this feel in different ways, but \\"The French Connection\\" is that rare film that doesn't feel like a film at all; it feels like the viewer is along for the ride, eavesdropping on the characters, and taking part in the action.  Really remarkable.<br /><br />Gene Hackman's star-making role as Popeye Doyle is the dictionary definition of \\"unblinking,\\" as this womanizing, racist, over-the-top violent slob pursues a hunch that leads to a huge drug bust, all while an unfriendly fellow detective reminds him often that one of his past hunches had led to the death of \\"a good cop.\\"  No detail is given, just as would not be given in a real-life situation.  The willingness of the director and screenwriter to not overdo these little details is a joy to behold, while the pace and texture of the entire movie are perfect from start to finish.<br /><br />Anyone who likes action films but hasn't seen \\"The French Connection\\" owes it to him/herself to do so right away.
6305079811|1.0|I was floored to see so many good reviews for this trashy movie! <br /> <br />I saw it when I was thirteen in 1980 for no other reason than I was a STAR WARS addict and would have seen ANYTHING that was sci-fi!  But even at that young, inexperienced age I could see this movie was over-the-top-campy, badly acted with bad dialogue. <br /> <br />Flash Gordon is probably one of those rare comic book characters that deserves a fresh new perspective; to be remade into a darker, more serious type of film with good dialogue and action, as in the spirit of BATMAN BEGINS or X-MEN.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's the TRILOGY on DVD what is there to say!  I really wish they had an option to remove the scened that Lucas added with the help of digital video or whatever....
079284131X|5.0|I wouldn't go so far as calling this movie funny exactly, but it does have some funny parts. I just think of it as comic relief, which this movie definitely needs. Some people may think this is stupid or more of a comedy than horror, but those people probably don't like horror in the first place, or were never scared of dolls like I was and, frankly, still am. But for a horror fan this is a must have. The dolls is quite frightening and the story line is creepy. This film also has good atmosphere and suspense, which, I don't care how \\"A-quality\\" a movie is, if it doesn't have those two qualities, its crap. Saw, The Ring, Scream, Urban Legend, etc all suck because of the lack of these two qualities(Ring is probably the best of these and Saw is definitely the most stupid, laughable, and boring wannabe horror i've ever seen). So if you like horror movies and like to be scared(but with a spoonful of fun), this is for you. Not as scary as say Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, The Haunting, original Texas Chain Saw Massacre, the Shining, or Friday 13th, but more on level with Fright Night, Cujo, or My Bloody Valentine.
B00023B1A8|2.0|This CD purchase was not one of the best I've ever made. I didn't realize it was recorded in the 90's. CSN just couldn't sing by then.
0940985691|5.0|I have read or rather, TRIED to read several books on Jyotish.  Each one either left me utterly confused or feeling like I had just read a guide to the best flavored chewing gum on the market.  <br />Light on Life is clear, comprehensive, well written and absolutely the real deal. My only complaint is a less than perfect reference at the back of the book.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I saw the originals on the big screen and consider myself an old fan, but let's face it, something had to be done. There are just too many people who turned STAR WARS into THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. While it's OK for little kids to memorize every line from THE LION KING and then recite them when they watch for the 50th time, it is absolutely infuriating to attempt to enjoy one of the STAR WARS films while others are reciting all the dialog. If Mr. Lucas did nothing else, at least he tripped up these noisy folks. I don't necessarily like the changes, but the chanting straight-edge legions really did need a little splash in the face.
B000002JEV|4.0|I have Led Zeppelin albums 1-4 and Houses of the Holy and i thought i should add a greatest hits album to my collection. I looked at the early days and the latter days and i realized, they were missing many great songs and was somewhat pricey. I then chose this album. Its live(my preference of listening) and some of the great songs such as stairway to heaven and black dog even sound somewhat.. better. If your just getting into Zeppelin or need something to your collection, this is the album for you. Lets look over the songs <br /> <br />Hits- I can't Quit on you baby, Communication Breakdown, Dazed and Confused, What is and What Should Never be, Whole Lotta Love <br /> <br />Those were the hits on disc 1 it also includes other great songs such as Somethin else, and one of my personal favorites You Shook Me <br /> <br />But Disc Two is the disc that really shows Zeppelin's Greatness <br />It includes the super hits Immigrant song Black Dog Stairway to Heaven and Going to California. <br /> <br />This album is great except, unfortunately its missing the Battle of Evermore and Rock n Roll which is why i gave it 4 stars. I highly recommend a combo of this album and Led Zeppelin 4 so you can have ultimate Zepp experience.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is perhaps Radiohead's greatest effort. The melodies found in each song are like nothing you've ever heard before. This CD was a must in my car, portable, and home stereo for nearly five years. I still can't go a few months without listening to it. The lyrics are nothing short of phenomenal, and the music will make you feel tingly all over (just listen to 'Exit Music - For a Film' from start to finish and you'll see what I mean). Thom Yorke pours his heart and soul into every song on here (minus 'Fitter Happier'). What I especially like about OK Computer is that nearly every song has a crescendo that is so moving and so powerful, it'll leave you feeling like a superhero who can't be stopped (e.g. - 'Lucky'). If you're new to Radiohead, I would recommend starting off with this album and then maybe follow it up with 'The Bends' and their debut album, 'Pablo Honey.' If you get past those, and want to hear something far different from this, check out 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' together (I have to give credit to Thom Yorke for going in a completely different direction with these 2 albums after the release of OK Computer - a truly original sound and stroke of genius if you ask me). If you get past those, you're left with 'Hail to the Thief' - a culmination of 'OK Computer' and 'Kid A' with an Orwellian message (if you're an automaton, chances are you're not going to 'get' this album).
0316776963|5.0|Very well written, a great read.  Many of my friends seem to think this is the best book ever written, which I think is a little over the top.  Nevertheless, it is a wonderful book.
0060763280|4.0|T. Harv Eker presents his way of thinking in a humorously straight forward yet simplistic way.  The book is a quick-read, makes a lot of sense and tempts a person to check out the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar.  I'm waiting for the millions to roll in with my newly trained mind!

0553582461|5.0|After reading Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series, I felt certain no other tale would rival it anytime soon -- I was wrong. Hobb's Tawny Man trilogy pulls you in and never lets go, leaving you wanting more even after the very satisfying conclusion. I can't wait to read Hobb's other books now.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Kowalski a good role model NOPE (drug addict, violent and sociopath)  But you can see how someone would end this way.  The sixties were over, Vietnam is a big disaster and drugs were going to be an issue.  I said that and still love this film; he gave all those around him the finger and went for it into the wild blue yonder.  I still want that car!!!
B00001OH7U|5.0|Much like Diamond Dogs served as a slow transition from glam rock to disco for Bowie, Station To Station served as the transition from disco to the yet unknown genra of new wave. Bowies next three albums Low, Heros, and Lodger or the 'Berlin Trio' would epitomize what would become new wave music in the early 1980's. Though I am more of a fan of David Bowies glam style with Mick Ronson on guitar I love all of his music. This album does a good job of piecing together all the styles of Bowies carear so far, New Wave, Disco, Soul/funk, glam-ish rock, and even a little folk, and doing so well in just six songs!<br /><br />Station To Station opens with the Anthemetic and highly original title track, 'Station To Station.' The song is somewhat of an epic clocking in at over ten minutes, Bowies longest song to this point and I think of his carear. As the song begins it is slow and reachs a highly dramatic peak creating one of the all time best songs David Bowie ever created. The semi-disco dance track 'Golden Years' became a minor hit for Bowie and becoming held as one of his all time best. A true classic in the Bowie cannon. Through Bowies carear he flirted with religion, even being quoted as saying Ziggy was the only Christian name he could find that began with the letter Z. 'Word On The Wing' is no exception. The song features some of Bowies all time best lyrics as well as his most sencer. The man pores his heart out about how though he belieaves he also has a mind of his own. 'TVC15' is my favorite song on the album as I'm ssure it is for most who own the album. 'TVC15' has since its release become a Bowie classic and at the time became a hit for Bowie, the biggest one off the album actually. It's a hard rocker, the hardest on the album. Heavy distorted guitars fuel the song as well as Bowies catchy hook. 'Stay' isnt a bad song at all it's just not one of my favorites. The lyrics suggest his relationship with someone (male or female?) is falling apart and though he wants that person to stay he realizes that, that could cause even more problems. Bowie's cover of 'Wild Is The Wind' is the best cover song he ever did. It's a nice mellow ballad and a nice calm ending to Station To Station.<br /><br />As any real David Bowie fan well tell you Station To Station is one of David Bowies all time best albums. While other albums had more hits like Young Americans, this is a better album. Do yourself a favor if you are a Bowie fan and pick this up. If your just getting into Bowie however I would recomend starting where I did, with the glam-rock. Albums like Ziggy Stardust and Alddin Sane are great places to start.ts that person to stay he realizes that, that could cause even more problems.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Stupid Keanu Reeves horror film that is as bad as the word of mouth. Keanu was miscast and he gives a very tired performance with a one-note character. The script itself is so poorly written that you will be astounded by some of the dialog that is spoken by the characters in this film and the plot really does not make a lot of sense once you try to put two and two together. Rachel Weisz does in fact give a riveting and haunting performance but she's the only actor in the film who dares to give one while the rest of the actors in the film fall flat on their faces with their one dimensional characters. (Peter Stormare does do well in his small but pivotal role but he's only in the movie for about three to four minutes) The visual effects are a let down compared to the films that have come out recently in the cinema and they get repetitive after a while. The direction is a joke with certain scenes that are shot so poorly that you have no idea on what is going on from scene to scene. A better director would have tried to make some sense on what was happening but this director only adds to the confusion that is already in the script. If you like to make fun of bad movies, then this movie is for you because other than Weisz's gutsy and complex performance, the movie has nothing to offer in the form of real entertainment.  <br />
B0007XT7V8|4.0|This album by far is a great follow up to Theory Of A Deadman's self-titled debut album. You can really tell they have grown and matured as a band by listening to this album &quot;Gasoline&quot;. If you like Nickelback, Default, Our Lady Peace, or that kind of music, this album is a must have. Great work by T.O.A.D, what will their next CD sound like?
020530902X|5.0|I bought this book when I changed careers from a high tech exec to an inspirational writer and speaker.  I used it constantly while writing both books I've had published.  It's and easy-to-understand, small and portable book that's chock full of useful reference info.  If you'd like to read two books with two different styles (memoir and self-help) that were written with a lot of help from this book, I recommend \\"Vita's Will: Real Life Lessons about Life, Death & Moving On\\" and \\"The Goddess of Happiness- A Down-to-Earth Guide for Heavenly Balance and Bliss\\".
B00005JNSK|4.0|Some fans of the 1971 movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" were not happy to find out that Tim Burton would direct a remake even though Burton had said that this remake would actually be more faithful to the 1964 children's novel by Rolad Dahl (which was, like this new version titled \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\").  Indeed this version is more faithful to the original novel even though it does take a few liberties.   <br /> <br />But all of that is really secondary.  Sure, this new version succeeds on those counts but the real story is the AMAZING performance of Johnny Depp in the dual role of WIlly Wonka and the smaller role of Charlie's mother.  He handles both roles with an aplomb that explains why he has evolved into such a respected actor.  Not many actors can pull such a trick of playing two roles in the same film, but Deep does it, and makes it look easy in the process.
B0000025LS|5.0|yup - santana's guitar tone in this album is amongst the most distinctive you'll ever get to hear in rock music (dont know if he had already embraced prs guitars then).    apart from the killer tone, the music in this album is as good as you can get from santana. e papa re, searching, love you much too much, american gypsy, sensitive kind (cover of jj cale's original) represent some of santana's most inspired fret work. the band is great too - the vocalist showing his mettle in \\"brightest star\\".    probably the only album in santana pantheon, which can truly compare with the magic of abraxas (though the latter's best were all covers!).
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I 'liked' the movie, but was not moved or engaged by it. The performances were adequate but not stellar, I was desparately trying to feel something for Constantine, and the other characters but just couldn't. The movie didn't reel you in like some thrillers, it was like being on the outside watching people do things that didn't seem to make much impact on their environment. The special effects were 'good', but nothing new.<br /><br />I guess some graphic novels don't translate well to film or the wrong person was doing the screenplay. I had hoped this movie to be intriguing, thought provoking, with action added to improve the flow, but got none of that...a disappointment at best.
0767818040|5.0|Great stuff that keeps the audience interested at all times.  Can you say that about most movies?  The plot is great, the acting is over the top, and the cinematography is fantastic.  It has the feel of an 80s horror flick which means it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It also feels like two movies in one.  The first movie is sort of a voyeristic creepy movie with that 80s feel and the second half is a sordid mystery with that 80s feel.  There's the 80s again!  It's definitely worth a watch. Enjoy with a movie loving friend! <br />
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Considering that Keanu Reeves is the lead, which is the only reason this got four instead of five stars.  (I can't stop picturing him in Bill & Ted)  I really don't know how so many people could hate this movie.  Admittedly, if you're going to see a movie that's deep and entirely filled with philosophy on the nature of god, yada, yada, yada, this is probably not the movie for you.  However, if you're looking for classic good versus evil, and a good time with a few humorous moments thrown in, then I would definitely recommend this.  I'm not going to compare it to the comic because I've never read it, but even so I think this is a good stand alone film because it explains all you need to know, and understanding is not dependent on being familiar with the comic before you watch it.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|yeah that is the worst thing you can say about this show, given the galaxy of stars and the performances!    i'm a huge fan of clapton of the late 60s and early 70s and i'm glad that it is in that spirit that he plays here. his jam/duel with carlos santana is itself worth the price of this dvd.    the sets of the blues greats - bb king, buddy guy, hubert sumlin are awe inspiring. multiple jams between them and clapton - great stuff!    eric johnson, robert cray, robert randolph and john mayer show that axe slinging is still alive with the younger generation. the first two put on an inspiring set.    the exotic piece is the hindustani piece played by vishna mohan bhatt from india with his self-invented/styled guitar which he plays with a slide.    the highlight of the show (imo) is the piece by john mclaughlin who is the guitarist's guitarist. such control and feel at such speed! unbelievable! i'm sure every guitarist out there was in a state of daze/shock after that 7 minutes of shredded melody!    james taylor is boring. and so is jj cale (though he is saved by clapton), larry carlton and steve vai. jimmy vaughn is not great - but i dig him for his spirit (one can only imagine what a show it would have been if his younger brother had been alive to play here - we miss you stevie)!    towards the end david hidalgo and joe walsh set the stage on fire and the concert is brought to an end by zz top (a mediocre set).    i hear that jeff beck and neil schon got edited out - a pity - as there is some stuff here in the dvd which could have easily substituted for those!    btw this review wouldnt be complete without a mention about the guitars used in the show : the fender stratocaster seems to reign supreme in this show - everybody from clapton to walsh to robert cray to jimmy vaughn to buddy guy is shown playing one. surprisingly very few gibson les pauls. john mclaughlin has a weird but solid looking guitar with only one pickup. hidalgo shows off a rare gibson firebird. likewise joe walsh, a brand new black rickenbacker. but imo the guitar of the show was the beautiful leaf shaped red gretsch with its trademark thumbnail inlays, sported by billy gibbons.    if you're a fan of the guitar, get this dvd!
B0002OERI0|1.0|I'm not a fan of this group at all (other than the album Warning. I like Warning), but I decided I'd give them ONE more chance after suffering through Dookie. Oops, my mistake. Of course, Billie Joe Armstrong STILL cannot sing, but that's not exactly news. He can't exactly make good music, either.<br /><br />Yes, there's a bit of experimentation - Extraordinary Girl had a cool worldbeat thing going on at the start, but quickly melted (for lack of a better term) into the group's usual unvarying power-trio look-at-us-we're-pop-punkers formula I know all too well. But unoriginality's still the name of the game - Are We the Waiting kicked off with a drum solo lifted from When the Levee Breaks, and Give Me Novocaine has a drum intro ripped off of Are We the Waiting. So they rip off their Led Zeppelin ripoff. Interesting...<br /><br />Okay, I haven't even gotten to the most annoying parts of American Idiot yet. No, it's not even the four awful hits that are contained here (the unusually political title track and Holiday, whose big statements - America is practically run by the media and the Iraq War is going wrong - aren't exactly big-time relevations; Wake Me Up When September Ends, smarmy even by their standards; the ludicrously overplayed Blvd. of Broken Dreams, an unlistenable self-pity fest in the form of a power ballad), though those are close. No, I'm talking about the two nine-minute \\"epics\\" (Jesus of Suburbia, Homecoming) which rummage through a pile of different parts that sound conspiciously alike (as usual, they sacrifice creativity and technical skill for speed and volume) while trying to tell some sort of story. But the story's just plain BORING - more of the \\"I'm a whiny suburban kid who's mad at my mom because she won't take me to the mall\\" dreck that makes up a big part of why I hate this band. Sorry Billie Joe, but you ain't Pete Townshend, and American Idiot ain't Tommy. And, of course, none of these guys can play their instruments. But you knew that.<br /><br />Okay, when am I gonna stop being so negative? Right now. I actually LIKED the closing song, Whatsername, surprisingly tuneful for the band. But to hear it you'll have to suffer through the rest. No thanks..., when am I gonna stop being so negative? Right now. I actually LIKED the closing song, Whatsername, surprisingly tuneful for the band. But to hear it you'll have to suffer through the rest. No thanks...
B000000ZGO|5.0|This is one of the best cds I own. Issac Hayes has a great voice and knows how to make great music. All four songs are epics and have good things about them. I recommended this to anyone who likes good soul music. Issac Hayes' true classic. Highly Highly Recommended.
0064407667|5.0|I started reading this in a checkout line at the store, and I was so intrigued by it, I bought it and rented the movie that night.  I am so thrilled to have stumbled into this series and I am going to buy all of them.  This 38 year old is reallying enjoying these books!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Let me just say that I fell in love with Almost Famous when I saw the previews for it about 5 years ago. I new that it was destined to be a great movie and it was. I loved the Original Version but would only let myself watch it like once a year because I was afraid if I watched it too much it would start to lose it's luster.  <br />Anyway, I bought the bootleg version a couple of months ago and put off watching it because I thought that the movie couldn't possibly be any better than I already thought it was. <br />Damn, was I wrong. Everybody has pretty much covered what features the bootleg version has so I won't go into detail. But, I honestly was pleasantly shocked and surprised at just how wonderful this movie really was.  <br />I highly recommend the Bootleg Version for anyone who is a fan of the regular movie. It definitly changes the movie for the better. Now, I watch the movie about once a week instead of once a year.

B00000J7SS|5.0|This is Miles Davis' true masterpiece. Kind of Blue is good but this stands out more to me. Listening to the music on this record calms me and chills me at the same time. The whole cd's good I would recommended this for fans of jazz or of music in general. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This movie was hilarious, what more can I say?<br /><br />Based on \\"Red Alert\\" by Peter Bryant (AKA Peter George), Dr. S. is a movie about a USAF General who goes \\"a little funny in the head\\" and sends all the B-52s in his bomb wing to attack the USSR.  A frantic president and Soviet premier (who we never see or hear, but the president is talking to him on the phone) try to avert the attack.  The result is a comedy with a bang of laughter.  More or less just like \\"Fail Safe\\" in that the president and the premier must work together to stop the attack from triggering nuclear war, only in Dr. Strangelove it makes for an absolutely hilarious plot, something Fail Safe doesn't even attempt to do.  The movie ends, not with a whimper, but with a bang.
0805047905|5.0|We have every Eric Carle book and this is our favorite.  The illustrations are colorful, simple, and fun.  Our son quickly learned his colors with Brown Bear's help.  Definitely recommend.
0679720200|5.0|As other people have stated, this is definitely a powerful book.  I love books that really make you re-evaluate your life and what components define you, and this is one of them.  As desolate as this sounds, the existentialist pattern of this book entices you to realize how trivial we are in the great scheme of things.  How many of us remember stories about or have even heard of the unremarkable \\"normal\\" people from 100 years ago?  Hardly anyone, I would assume, unless you're into genealogy.  The main character's indifference with the world is more honest than I could imagine.  When his girlfriend asks for him to marry her, he basically says OK, and when she asks him if he loves her, he tells her that he doesn't really love her, and then she asks him why he would marry her, and he tells her because that is what she wants.  In modern times, how many people can be thought of that get married for that same reason?  It's the same thing when he's in jail.  He says that it doesn't matter when he dies because he's going to die someday anyway.  This is definitely a book that leads the reader to new thoughts about life.  Since this is such a short, interesting, and easy read, I highly recommend it to anyone, from the non-reader that wants to experience a new kind of philosophy, to the ardent reader that doesn't have a lot of time on his or her hands.  A truly wonderful book.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is an astounding novel. I found that the events Charlie describes with innocence and truth seem incredibly real. It is a novel composed these events, which Charlie recounts to an unknown person. In choosing to leave the person unknown I unconsciously took up the identity of that person and was drawn into the book. I have since read The Perks Of Being A Wallflower several times and have also shared it with many of my friends. I always find myself going back to the poem that Charlie's best friend left as his suicide note. That poem has so much depth and meaning it has caused me to study it again and again. I happened to read The Perks Of Being A Wallflower while I was surviving through a particularly painful experience. I found comfort, understanding and beauty encapsulated within the pages of this novel and I hope that others will be able to do the same.
B0002858YS|1.0|These dipsticks are so into makin their video all fancy they don't stop to think about the one thing in music that is truly important...TALENT. Although, that truly doesn't matter today because people will buy anything as long as it's on MTV. This has to be the worst thing I've heard in years, and I predict these guys will go out of style quicker than you can say Hanson or Spice Girls. Yeah, I said it, bite me. Forget listenin to the \\"popular\\" stuff such as this, most of it's absolute garbage. <br />I think if you look of the word popular in the dictionary of MTV and VH1 it simply means HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. Don't be part of a fad you'll look back on in 5 years and have to kick your own @$$ for.
044024157X|1.0|I am a huge John Grisham fan, but this book was not worth the paper it was written on.  He seemed to lose interest in the story he was writing about half-way through.  Once the trial was done, he diverted his attention to a lashing of Vietnam and Wal-mart (not so cleverly hidden with another name, but he threw in every cliche the liberal media uses against Wal-mart.  It made me ill).  These were not relevent to the story, and served no purpose other than to be a pulpit from which Mr. Grisham could vent his personal views.  From there I lost interest in the story, but finished reading just to see where he would go from there.  Mercifully, he got off the puplit at that point and got back to story.  The wrap up was boring, and poorly conceived.  Not at all the thriller fans have grown accustomed to.  If this is a preview what Mr. Grisham has left in him to write about.  I won't be buying any more of his works.
B00099BPP6|5.0|Years ago I had a cassette of this recording and it was always one of my favorites. The sound on this digitally remastered version is fantastic. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was always one of my favorites, but he did not record much Italian opera. His baritone has a unique timber and he gives a powerful and dramatic performance as Rigoletto. Bergonzi is in excellent voice and makes a splendid Duke. I was never a big Scotto fan, but she too is in excellent voice in this recording. Her voice is more beautiful than I remember it when hearing her perform in the 70's and 80's. The rest of the cast and overall performance are top notch. I was so anxious to get this new version and was not disappointed.
6305882592|5.0|How can anyone complain about the soundtrack of Harold and Maude? Cat Stevens was a perfect pick. This movie is colorful and creative. It deals with meaningful issues such as self fulfillment, the spontaneity and wonder of life, death. The movie is commical but what moved me most of all was the bond between the characters. This is a think-outside-of-the-box movie and the character bond that I'm talking about is quite provocative (if you so choose to frown upon it).  <br /> <br />I felt lifted after I watched Harold and Maude. It's a movie for idealists and people who enjoy symbols and hidden meanings.
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|Bond is one of the best groups I've ever heard.  Beautiful and powerful music. <br />This Cd is ok.  I think it could have been better.  I know it was supposed to be \\"The Best of Bond\\", and I don't think there are any songs of theirs that I dislike, but I do have my favorites and many of them weren't on this Cd.  I loved the three new songs they put on the cd: caravan, sugar plum, and carmina.  I'm so ready for a cd of theirs to come out with all new music on it though. A \\"best of\\" album kind of is like putting it off.  They redid \\"Wintersun\\" into a much better version than their original. I really like it now.  And they put it on this Cd. So that's cool.  As far as the DVD side goes, I love the videos, but I would have liked more of them. And I'm not sure the 5.1 surround sound is all it's cracked up to be although Bond's music is so powerful I doubt they need it.
B000A2RRF4|1.0|Why does Michael Jackson keep releasing the same concert. I want to see the Bad tour, HIStory tour, MSG 2001 concert. I'm really seriouse.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I had heard an interview with Michael Buble in which they played the first track, \\"Feeling Good.\\"  It was jazzy, full of big band sounds and great original-sounding vocal styling.  I bought the CD thinking it would all be like that.  I was just underwhelmed.  The covers are not as good as others that have done them, e.g.,\\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" is like a kitten mewing compared to Michael Bolton's lion roaring.  His \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\" was a complete rip off of Sinatra, virtually in every detail, including orchestration.  It's okay, but not what I was expecting based on that first track.
B000003BF4|5.0|`Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out' is one of the most famous live recordings done by a major rock group and it is probably the very best one done by the Rolling Stones. And, its fame has less to do with the fact that it is by `the greatest rock and roll band in the world', than with the fact that it is a concert done on the tour where the Rolling Stones and a whole generation of rock fans lost their innocence at the Stones headlined free concert at Altamont raceway near Los Angles. It is this whole tour which is chronicled in the movie `Gimme Shelter' which shows on stage performances in several cities plus off stage hijinks, leading up to the events near the stage at Altamont perpetrated by the Hells Angels while the Stones were on the stage.<br /><br />As this album deals exclusively with the performance in New York City, there is nothing on the album which deals with the Altamont concert, so it can be enjoyed with no guilt. But, it was many months between the time this album was originally released in 1970 and when I could bring myself to buy it on vinyl, so alienated was I from the Rolling Stones. In fact, I was listening to `Let It Bleed' daily up to the time the news report came out about the Altamont events and I was so revulsed by the event that I gingerly removed the album from my turntable, filed it away, and did not listen to it or any other Rolling Stones album for several months. All this is simply to put in perspective how important this particular album is in the history of the Rolling Stones, especially for me.<br /><br />Otherwise, this album represents the Rolling Stones at the very apex of their stage presence and power. I still remember articles in Rolling Stone magazine stating that Mick and Keith appeared totally mature for the first time. And, it stated that the show was pretty much all about Mick, and the rest of the band was quite happy to let him carry the day.<br /><br />At this point in their career, the Rolling Stones had the enormous luxury of picking numbers from an enormous number of major hits written by both Jagger and Richard and by classic rockers such as Chuck Berry. Needless to say, their choice of the selections and the order in which they are done are excellently played out on this CD. There is none of their dimly remembered experiments from `Their Satanic Majesties Request' and not too much really early stuff, except for the cuts by Berry. The musicianship and audio engeneering is a very good balance between the energy of the live performance and a relatively high quality of live musicianship. You can even appreciate the piano by premier rock sideman, Nicky Hopkins who, according to reports at the time, was banging away at the keyboards from behind the stage, out of sight from the audience.<br /><br />Oddly, the quality of the performance means that it may not be enormously different from their studio versions of the same material. There is none, for example, of the long impromptu explorations such as you find on the great Who record, `Live at Leeds'. But, this is a very good album none the less.ous number of major hits written by both Jagger and Richard and by classic rockers such as Chuck Berry.

B00005JL78|5.0|A few unfortunate children were born with psychic ability to see the future. Unfortunate, because they saw only the most shocking events, murders. Once this ability was realized, they became organic components in a massive machine. The Pre-Crime machine's purpose was to stop the murder that was about to happen, rather than solve it after the fact. Once the system is put in place, the murder rate goes to zero - the system is perfect.<br /><br />But of course, it's not. In fact, this movie turns into a murder mystery of the kind that the perfect system was meant to end. It's a thoughtful movie, with cause and effect rattling backward and forward through time. There's one good action sequence, though, when Tom Cruise (playing John Anderton) runs from arrest for the crime he didn't yet commit. Saying more would say too much, but Max von Sydow (as head of Pre-Crime), Samantha Morton (as one of the psychics) and others all put in good performances.<br /><br />The movie ends on a hopeful note. People can see mistakes and fix them, even mistakes on so huge a social scale. Maybe the system isn't perfect, but it keeps trying.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah came back hard. This is the first Mariah cd I have actually bought..the rest of them..well you know...., and it didnt disappoint. Beyonce needs to take a few pointers. She is a great singer also but her material is so childish. I cant imagine her singing the same songs Mariah wrote..that would be crazy...until then she cant even touch Mariah...I love the entire CD..you can play it from beginning to end but my favorite is Circles..if you are a true Mariah fan you wont be disappointed.
B0007P3582|1.0|I remember seeing an ad for this in a magazine, but it was the \\"St. Valentine's Day Massacre,\\" which kind of went along with his mob themed shoot and interview in XXL.  I can't say as I particularly cared, but then I saw the album on shelves a few months later.  I don't know what kind of business move this s%!# was, but his aesthetic on this b!%#$ is wacckkkk.  Look at the cover... he looks like he smoked some fake buds, took a phat a!# stack of steroids, and got a Cleveland steamer from Eminem.      Back to the point; I don't really understand why our nation picked this guy to be the next new thing in Hip Hop... I don't really consider the beats or the rhymes very infectious (they sound dry, brittle, and very disparate and mismatched along the duration of the album).  The whole thing just seems kitschy as f%!# to me, and not in a good way.  I mean, honestly... who elected this #uth!f!#%a.      I don't think anybody really made a choice here... I think the label he's on and his business practices have forced this record onto shelves (if you saw this the first day out, it was about 1/4 of the record store in a lot of places... and I don't know about where you are, but a lot of places around here this is still sitting there, probably some of the same copies).  If everybody who thought they were going to buy 50's joint went for last year's Masta Killa LP instead, they would either have no luck finding it in the store or about 1 or 2 people might be able to buy it.  50's shelf presence is so much that he constitutes half of the Hip Hop section.      His marketing campaign is built on the premise of his first record, and that what he's done with that is brought a kind of bravado to the top 40 that made people who didn't give a f!%# before start to get into this gangsta ish (don't believe me?  talk to somebody who likes 50 and ask them what else they like).  Releasing those videos ahead of time didn't hurt anything for him, either.  It's all image, but when that image isso ridiculous, I don't even know what to think.  I obviously didn't buy this %#!# and hope you don't either.  Late.
B000002ORU|4.0|This is a big pill to swallow.  It is a huge pill.  Five hours of a band that has built the reputation of being the hardest rocking band out there.  The Who have been around since the early sixties, and this box captures it all.  Not every track, but plenty enough to capture an acurate picture of the band at every stage of their career from The High Numbers through the 1989 Reunion Tour.  In addition to the unforgettable and unforgivable songs in their illustrious catalogue, this collection is peppered with amusing snippits of concert dialogue, comedic radio sitcoms, and studio false starts.  Alternate versions of already familiar songs help keep this collection fresh, and the book that comes with it is detailed and enlightening.  There is more than enough here to introduce the uninitiated to The Who, and there is certainly enough unreleased material to keep the ititiated interested.  This is comprehensive.  It is what a box set is supposed to be.  However, don't expect to be listening to it start to finish repeatedly.  Rather, it is like a cherrished book that is lovingly read every once in a long while and fondly remembered in between.
0061020710|3.0|I'm a great fan of humor, fantasy, sci-fi and many other kinds of literature, and so for some time have wanted to begin the journey into Discworld. I finally figured out that this was the first book in the series (though I understand that one does not need to read them in any particular order--I just wanted to start with the first book first).<br /><br />The book does have some wry humor, though not as obvious as, say Douglas Adams (nor as funny in this reader's opinion). Humor goes only so far, though, in any story. The solid-ness of the book is its interesting and engaging story and characters, which is what any good book needs.<br /><br />I found the book difficult to get into at first, but persevered; I'm glad I did. I still found myself reading some passages over and over again, just to figure out what the author was saying or describing. Some action sequences totally confused me and so I read them several times to figure out what was going on. This happened many times with simple descriptions, too. It is a simple lack of clarity in the writing.<br /><br />So the book was fun and interesting, but sloppily written. I found some passages to be very funny, but didn't find the book to be as humorous as I had expected. But then again, maybe I'm just getting grouchy in my old age.<br /><br />I will probably read other books in the Discworld collection, but I'm not, at the time of this writing, planning on doing so soon.
B00009V7P8|4.0|As Many probably did, I found out about Damien Rice from his single \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" being featured in the movie Closer. <br /> <br />After hearing it and thinking, \\"God, what a beautiful song!\\", I had to investigate. <br /> <br />This CD will not disappoint! The songs are simply lovely to listen to...and talk about expiramenting! Damien Rice uses chanting at a point in the song, \\"Cold Water\\" and has a Opera singer doing back up vocals on \\"Eskimo\\". <br /> <br />There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like! Damien is completely refreshing to most music acts out there! What a great find and definately a great CD to have in your collection :)
B00005LQ04|4.0|With lots of similarly infamous films, there is that divine rule of \\"either you love it or you hate it\\". This applies to such masterworks as 'Requiem for a Dream', 'Fight Club', and 'M'. But with 'Suspiria', it's more of a question of \\"either you get it or you don't.\\"<br /><br />After some shaky dubbing and a confusing murder in the first 25 minutes of the film, 'Suspiria' quickly redeems itself and becomes one of the most haunting and original horror films I have ever seen. Images from 'Suspiria' will remain in my thoughts until the day I meet my maker, especially scenes from the shocking final act.<br /><br />Which brings us to the reason you either catch on to the film or you miss the point. There is no sense in trying to hold up the storyline to scrutiny, as there really isn't one. Why would a coven of witches run a school of balet just to kill off their own pupils? This is not the point of 'Suspiria', which may come as a shock to those acustomed to boorish, paint-by-numbers shockers of recent years (Saw, White Noise, The Grudge, etc.).<br /><br />Director Dario Argento's main purpose is to show us startling images accomplished through over-the-top lighting, eerie music, and brutal camera angles. The movie is like a frontal assault on the senses, stabbing away at you relentlessly until the final frame of the movie, doing anything in its power to get a rise out of you. The things you see in this film are unlike any that you will see anywhere else, even in the obligatory Hollywood-ized remake that is almost certain to upchuck itself into cinemas in the next few years. There are secret passages, rooms full of barbed wire, angry bats, knife-weilding demons, living corpses, and, most notorious, a still-beating heart stabbed repeatedly.<br /><br />'Suspiria' is not for everybody. Some will be completely lost and will run back crying to their mundane slasher franchises. But for those that have the stomach and the brains, 'Suspiria' is one title worth checking out.out.
B000022TSY|4.0|Where Easy Rider is concerned, what can be said that hasn't already been said - it is both a metaphor and a history of its time... and of today, if you're still part vagabond and spend any real time in the saddle - poseurs need not apply, this movie isn't about them.   <br /> <br />The superb music sounds like a replay of AM radio of that era, and the scenes still bring a hunger and longing of wanderlust and desire to crank up the bike.  The acting is, of course, what it is - a tad contrived in spots, artful in others, but comes together in mildly appalling reminiscences of those smoky campfire scenes of yore - how did we ever survive those years! <br /> <br />Although the couch potatoes often think so, the movie ending hostility and brutality wasn't all that contrived, and I can vividly recall being bodily run out of a much needed gas-stop in rural Mississippi back then, just for the crime of showing up on a bike wearing leather (it was November...) -- and even today, not every motel looks kindly on bikes unless they're of the Tupperware barge variety.  Never mind that Easy Rider starts with a drug buy, we were pretty naive back then, the general peaceful wandering of the two says as much about the era, and those of us who were too wiped out to truly remember the 60's, as, say, Star Trek says about the social issues we attempted to wrestle with... <br /> <br />Not real history, but well worth the time, even if it really isn't much of a motorcycle movie... <br /> <br />
B00097A5HW|4.0|\\"Fijacion Oral\\" is a new album from Shakira, who became an internatinal pop-star, let's face it, after becoming a blonde hottie. After rather disappointing, however best-selling \\"Laundry Service\\", Shakira finally comes back with a fresh breeze of originality. \\"Fijacion Oral\\" offers variety of genres and moods, reflecting Shakira's own musical taste. This time she certainly feels no pressure from the record label and is allowed to sing what she really feels like, with her rough unpolished, yet warm voice. The singer gets back to her roots with solid song writing. Very enjoyable music for the hot summer days.
B000001OAA|4.0|Garbage's first album is a bridge between the simplistic (but still fun) garage rock of vocalist Shirley Manson's previous band, Angelfish and the Pro Tools meandering of her bandmates (well, at least one bandmate). But I'll bet you'd rather have me cut to the chase and tell you why you could fall head-over-heels in love with this album: <br />\\"Supervixen\\": OK, this is not really a great song, but the aggressive guitars and Manson's invitation to worship her make it worth listening to.  <br />\\"Queer\\": For me, this is where the album really starts. The juxtaposition of the relatively light instrumentals with the biting, innuendo-laced lyrics is great. <br />\\"I'm Only Happy When It Rains\\": A delightfully ironic song that will make you want to wear all black and dance around the room. <br />\\"As Heaven Is Wide\\": Chilling instrumentals and vindictive lyrics make for an amazing song. <br />\\"Not My Idea\\": Not really my kind of song at all, but it has good lyrics and a better guitar riff. <br />\\"Stroke of Luck\\": Calm, cool, and nebulous... a nice break before: <br />\\"Vow\\": Another rip-out-his-heart-and-stomp-on-it song, the loudest and most plain spoken on the album. It would be very ordinary except for the historical references. <br />\\"Stupid Girl\\": How many people do you know who can sample the Clash so well that you're disappointed to hear the original song?  <br />\\"Dog New Tricks\\": Somewhat akin to \\"Not My Idea,\\" but more feedback. Whether or not it is any good depends on your mood. <br />\\"My Lover's Box\\": Here, Manson does a workable job of being lonely and desperate. <br />\\"Fix Me Now\\": The worst song- no one wants to hear Manson as a penitent girlfriend with lame background music. <br />\\"Milk\\": The eeriest, most beautiful ballad I have heard in my life. <br />On the whole, it isn't my favorite Garbage album (the hyper follow-up, Version 2.0, holds that honor), but it is a very good album in its own right.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I saw the first two Austin Powers movies with a British friend, who was practically rolling in the aisle the whole time. I enjoyed them too, but about half of the British humor went over my head. But I still thought they were funny. And my friend definitely did. In fact, sometimes I was laughing just because of his infectious laugh, to the point where I had to use my asthma inhalor a couple of times. :-)<br /><br />But I enjoyed this film more than the previous two, except for the character of Goldmember, who just wasn't funny at all. Goldmember was more like Goldloser. I mean come on, I'm not even a comedian and even I could think of funnier things to do with the Goldmember character. He didn't even have brass (or gold) balls that clanked when he walked. :-) But the other funny characters and throw-away gags still make the film worth viewing.<br /><br />In some ways, Michael Myers reminds me a little bit of our David Letterman in his approach, whose humor ranges from the cerebral to the low-brow and to cheap, throw-away gags that still get a laugh as in the ones in this movie. In that sense, the low-brow sort of British humor is somewhat incongruous, if you consider how prim and proper and upstanding the British can be on the one hand, and yet on the other, their low-brow humor can be even cruder than the American sort. :-) So overall, a pretty funny flick despite Myers missing the mark completely with the Goldmember character.
B00000099Y|4.0|Dark, eery, & thoughtful, Tool's nima is a modern metal how-to guide, providing some blueprints as to what a rock album should be.  All musicians possess something truly special and are able to bond together beautifully.  The songwriting is cleary top-notch, something rarely seen in a genre like this.  Get rid of those Tool rip-offs the mars volta and replace it with the record as soon as possible.
B00014X8KO|5.0|5 stars! and that's just for Magnetic Rose, the first of three stories told in Memories. With three different directors all putting their own specialities into Otomo's work, it creates an amazing and diverse experience in watching.They are put in an order that i found to be the order in which i liked them. I was blown away by Magnetic Rose, so just buy this set and watch them.
B00005JNTX|4.0|thanks to Frank Miller, Author of original Sin City Graphic novels who have directed this movie too, Ciertaily it's one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen. I'm not a cinema guy cause I can't watch a movie from beginning till the end without delay and I used to play back some scenes to watch them again and if I couldn't, It would sure made me rattle and nervous. but this movie is different. I just coudn't stop it even to use restroom! It was great, the only problem I noticed was the boold. In some scenes it was white, in some it was silver and in another some it was yellow and that made blood scenes less impressive. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, they should've shown the bood in black, not any other colors. and another problem of the movie was the Junior, at the end. they colored him and his stuff in yellow. that was inducing that the Junior is an alien not a human. but he was a maniac human and this movie was not star wars or star trek. we expected to see living dead & Unvulnarable Superhumans but not an alien like creature. and the third problem is not this movie's problem in particular! It's the next sequel's problem and the problem is, they'd gathered all suitable stars in this movie. Bruce willis, mickey rourke, Benecio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba and more but most of them died in the movie. so there is not much stars left for the sequel I hope they make it as soon as possible. Cast selection for this movie was extremely accurate and I'm afraid for the next sequel if they'll not do their job as good as this one. and at last it's not bad to mention that this movie was a big credit for Rodriguez after making some horrible movies like Spy Kids trilogy and I hope he continue to making movie with his original talent that we've previously seen in Desperado (1995).
0312323859|5.0|This book was a great follow up to \\"Something Borrowed\\".  Althought I didn't like Darcy at the beginning, she grew on my through out the book.  I would recommend this to anyone!!
B000000H66|4.0|this is a 4.75 stars in my book.. not perfect but so damn influential as to be considered a classic of the genre.  Chuck is full borne here, balancing insane riffs with heaviness.  Absolute clasics: 1,000 eyes, crystal mountain, without judgement.  Those tunes alone show what this album is.. a vision.  it is progressive enough, death enough, metal enough... it doesnt go to far in any category.  The vocals are clean enough to hear everything, the drums are just right (and interesting)... The guitar work is absolutely superb throghout, fills, solos, acoustic interludes, harmonics...  This album is a showcase of Chuck and his vision.  Where early Death albums were mired in speed, this one lends itself to beauty, much like carcass of the same era (except this album might be more \\"progressive\\").  Opeth fans take note, listen to this album. <br /> <br />back to my tag line... you can hear the fury of deicide and the drum complex of Nile here, this platter crosses borders.. and I say it ends perfectly, the album \\"feels\\" complete which many great albums fail to accomplish.
0881889148|5.0|Be sure to get the entire two-volume set.  You not only get songs the Beatles wrote, but also their versions of covers they did such as \\"Kansas City.\\"  The sheet music is clear and quite easy to follow, which makes learning the songs easier.  Beginners may have some trouble with this, but certainly intermediate players will be able to take off.<br /><br />The harmonic treatment of the songs is stellar.  For those who are \\"multi-lingual\\" musically, chords, notes and tabulature is provided.  That way everybody who can read at least one form of music can really put this book to good use.  I am also delighted that the lyrics are included.  That way, people who either don't know all the words or who want to learn them can sing along.<br /><br />Another excellent feature is that the instrumental sections of the songs are included.  This book is a must have.  Be sure to check out the Beatles' Complete Scores and the finger pickin' guitar book of Beatle songs as well.  However, of the choices presented, this book is your first choice.<br /><br />Guitar players, make this book your best friend when you want to play and/or learn to play Beatle songs the Beatle way.  Not only will you derive a lot of satisfaction, but others will enjoy your playing as well.  Don't be surprised if you get lots of requests to play some Beatles!
B0006L16N8|2.0|I am a Coldplay fan, but most of the arrangements on this album are very similar & even similarly whiney.  I was sorely disappointed!
B0000JCFPE|5.0|This movie Stars very good characters for the plot,The movie starts out with a grusome murder (If you have the unrated version)and a detective is sent in to figure out who did it and after some facts were discover they go to a supects house and from then The detective meets a woman that has some thing to do with it but can't figure it out because of the twist and turns she puts in his head and then she slowly seduces him.But the detective does not lose his thought's about what she's up to which makes the movie interesting to see. The dvd comes with lots of stuff so don't worry
B0006L16N8|5.0|So check it out:  I am pretty much a music snob.  I can tell quickly whether or not certain music is worth my time.  It's like I have musical itch I am looking around to have scratched.  I can tell quickly if a CD is scratch-worthy. Are you this way?  If you are discerning, I invite you to give this CD a whirl.  It's one of the best I've heard in a few years, other than Keane's Hopes and Fears (another gem!).  It is a rare day when I grin and glow over a CD (particularly these days).  I've listened to nothing else since it came out.  Enjoy!
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Gothika is not scary at all it's mostly base on events that pushes it self to the anwser. The movie is very dark and blue and takes place in a mental hospital ,Halle berry plays a doctor that helps mental patents like penelope cruz who does great in this movie by away.When Halle goes home she see's a girl on the road When she tries to help her she all of a sudden wakes up in the mental hospital as a patent the rest of the movie is really good and a big must see.
B00026W82U|4.0|With all of the grinding rock and roll and pulsing electronica about, it's nice to catch a breath of fresh air with The Kings of Convenience.  Their latest offering shows the Scandanavian duo to have absolute mastery of their indie-folk palette as they lay down a charming collection of lighthearted and introspective tunes.  It's a stylish blend of coffee-house rock, frisky lounge jazz and Simon and Garfunkle-esque intertwined vocal harmonies.  Songs like the whimsical \\"Misread,\\" the snazzy \\"Live Long\\" and the dramatic \\"Suprise Ice\\" will leave you quietly mesmerized.  Don't be fooled however.......The Kings are far from one trick ponies.  For proof, the lads offer up the wincing and humorous \\"I'd Rather Dance With You,\\" featuring an infectiously intoxicating vocal hook, and the seductive and compelling \\"The Build-Up\\" that paints a picture-perfect scene of romantic longing and intrigue. Armed with an ample mix of acoustic ambience, the occassional horn interlude and two equally talented and angelic voices and the boys easily lay claim to their crown as the \\"kings\\" of mellow.
B00000JCOV|5.0|this is still slipknot's best album.  the only thing better then listening to this is watching the disasterpieces dvd. to see most of these songs live is kick a$$
078681859X|3.0|I read Diana Wynne Jones' Castle in the air before this one, and I have to say that, while Bartimaeus is the bright point in the story, with his snotty footnotes to the reader, the djinn in \\"Castle\\" is every bit as funny and the rest of the characters in \\"Castle\\" far outshine what poor old (very) Bartimaeus had to put up with. <br /> <br />Nathaniel, Bartimaeus' main compatriot of sorts, is misled and misunderstood, but he is not very compelling.  You sort of root for him, but wish you could like him more.  He does learn along the way, but somehow falls flat on the likable scale. <br /> <br />The world of modern London with magicians vs commoners (and \\"magic\\" being primarily a matter of controlling magical beings, or \\"elementals\\") is a good concept and well done.  This different \\"take\\" on magic and Bartimeaeus' footnotes make the book worth reading.   <br /> <br />You can tell the second book in the trilogy will have a larger focus.  Maybe with this, and a few more characters, it will have more to draw a reader's compassion.
0380789035|5.0|American Gods is perhaps one of the most explosively quotable books ever created. Gaiman's masterful style lends itself beautifully to this dynamic tale of an ex-con struggling to come to grips with his life, his past and his dead wife in a land inhabited by defunct old gods.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, this book is insanely quotable. There isn't a single chapter that isn't replete with lines you can repeat to friends and family with a grin on your face. From Wednesday's description of roadside attractions as holy places, to Mad Sweeney's wake, the dialogue and narrative pick you up and sweep you along.<br /><br />As for the plot: A Thirty-Two year old man named Shadow gets out of prison only to discover that his wife and best friend were both dead. Suddenly single and jobless, he gains employment from Mr. Wednesday, the massive man he met on the plane, who knows altogether too much about Shadow.<br /><br />Although the book does diverge a lot from the main story, the divergences are all interesting and well written. I would happily read them over again.<br /><br />This book is a masterpiece. I have read it over and over, and it gives me something new each time. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I will say that this is a wonderful album.  It is much more reserved than most DT albums.  It is not nearly as flashy as albums like ToT and I&W.  Root of All Evil has some recurring themes from Glass Prison and Dying Soul but it is supposed to have that because it is a mini-series.  Nobody complained when SFAM had recurring riffs and even recurring solos.  It is moderately heavy but still fits LaBrie's Voice.  He has a very pretty voice and sometimes does not fit with the heavier stuff.  That is not the case with Octavarium.  I was very impressed on this entire album how they had some heavier stuff but still fit their singer.  The songs are catchy and progressive.  The riff and tempo changes are not very extreme which adds some flow to the songs.  There is some slower softer stuff on this album as well.  The songs are all well written.  The biggest complaint of mine for this album is the epic title track.  It has some really cool stuff in it but it sounds like a forced effort.  In other words, it is good but I doubt I'll listen to that song hardly at all if ever.  Root of All Evil, These Walls, and Never Enough were the stand out songs for my taste. <br /> <br />As for the future of DT, they need a change-up.  They always have mixed things up with new members.  One thing that I always wanted to hear was another album with Derek Sherinian.  FII is good but not very progressive.  Sherinian would do wonders for the band's current musical direction.  Ruddess is nothing but amazing but he would be better suited doing his own thing nowadays.  Virgil Donati has been playing with Sherinian in Planet X for the last few years.  They recently lost their virtuoso guitar player and haven't done anything since.  Donati and Sherinian ought to join up with DT.  As for Portnoy, his work on OSI and John Arch's solo album were two of his best works.  Portnoy should stick with Jim Matheos.  They compliment each other's sounds very well.  Now that Ray Adler is joined with Redemption and Mark Zonder is inconsistent Fates Warning is pretty much done with, unless Portnoy and Arch join up.  OSI or FW is cool with me for Portnoy.  Most of you may not want to see that happen, but I think it would be awesome.
B00006YXEK|5.0|I have been a Beatlemaniac since age 5, when my parents gave me my first Beatles Album (The Beatles Again; 1970). I purchased this album on recommendation from a fellow Beatlemaniac. I have listened to this album virtually every day for a year and a half. George left it all on the vinyl, and most lovingly. Thank you George, for this musical treasure.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay rocks..... beautiful music. Its also a great alternative than the other emo/punk/screamo/whatever rock bands. Buy this album!
B00008CLIP|2.0|MTV Unplugged 1 was a great album, that blended very well. Unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs.
B00005JNTX|4.0|For anyone who is interested in reading the graphic novels of this movie after watching it, which I highly recommend, the three books are \\"Sin City\\", \\"The Big, Fat Kill\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\".  As a fan who has read all three of those stories many, many times, I simply felt that the proper titles should have been given, since the editorial review, and another review mixed up the titles.  Marv was in \\"Sin City\\", Hartigan was in \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" and Dwight was from \\"The Big, Fat Kill\\".  Unfortunately, this was not a direct translation, and as always, the books are far better.  I look forward to the director's cut to see if some of my favorite lines that were absent make it in.  At which point the movie will reach five stars.
0743454537|2.0|The book is long, but I'll be brief...Interesting topic. Middle falls flat. Written in fits and starts with flashes of artsy philosophy and continuous medical procedure that eventually loses its relevance. Characters lose credibility half way through. The side plots devolve into cliches with no climax---Jesse, Campbell and Julia, the cold-hearted mother, Judge De Salvo...blahblahblah. FILLED with melodrama, no surprises. Not only could I see the ending coming a mile away, I could see the entire book unfold half way through and thought it was intentionally written that way to build to something less trite. Chicken Soup for the Soul, but with the occasional F-bomb (which really is not a problem.)Critics say that this book was not as well written as her earlier work, and I might give another book a try---it just seems like she got tired around page 250. Disappointing, considering a strong beginning.
0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown develops a fairly good story in this novel but the plot is kind of hard to believe. Maybe not as good as The Da Vinci Code but it makes good airplane reading.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I had a date with a young lady doctor yesterday and we went to hear the San Francisco Opera perform an afternoon of arias at the Stern Grove Festival in San Francisco; a perfect setting on a foggy Sunday afternoon for an open air concert. Later, my date invited me to her new home in the Marina district of the city for dinner. As you might have guessed, during the dinner the background music was Yo Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone. I was so moved by the intimate compositions of Ennio Morricone and the graceful interpretations of Yo Yo Ma that, I could hardly concentrate on our dinner conversation. I felt so relaxed, it felt so surreal. The emotions that this CD has stirred in me, made me to go online and buy immediately on Amazon.com this beautiful Disc once I returned home.
B0002I831S|5.0|What a treat it is to have Star Trek on DVD. Spock, Jim and Bones in digital quality.<br /><br />I grew up watching Star Trek. Every aspect of the series worked in near flawless cooperation with one another. The music, acting, drama, fight scenes, romance, politics, ethics, etc., merged into one big hour of television that was impossible not to watch.<br /><br />Star Trek was literally a culture changer, opening up a new genre of television and movies. Sure, we had space aliens and space travel in movies and on television, but Star Trek was so much more. It was human drama - real human life - in the midst of chaos. And the setting just happened to be space.<br /><br />The cast and stories of Star Trek could have been ported to any other genre and the show would have been successful. After all, Star Trek was about the human condition. After watching any given show, I was always left feeling that I had been right there in the midst of the crew's struggles and triumphs. I was sucked into the stories, and they became a part of me.<br /><br />The first season is timeless, and should not be missed. It ranks among the top 10 \\"first seasons\\" in television history. It was more than a good program, it forever changed sci-fi culture.
B000002JOH|5.0|Get this album if you like Heavy Metal and aggressive powerful music.  Also, it's great to listen to while working out.  I have Cowboys From Hell, Far Beyond Driven, and The Great Southern Trendkill in addition to this title.  Get all four if you can.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was amazing.  Great cast, funny, dramatic, creative, and addictive.  By the time you get to episode 14 you feel a little let down because you don't want it to end.  All in all this was an excellent purchase and I'm extrememly psyched for the movie to come out!
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton has done a great service for the world by showing exactly why mind/body health technologies like Tai Chi, Qigong, Yoga, and Meditation, are so effective on a cellular level.  This knowing will add to the emerging natural health revolution of mind/body sciences. -- We've known for years through emerging medical research that Tai Chi, Qigong, Yoga, and Meditation positively affect the physiology in profound ways, boosting the immune system and improving well being, reducing depression, anxiety, etc.  We've also know that these mindful exercises can have a powerful physiological impact on systems within the body, blood pressure, arterial health, bone density, etc. etc. -- But NOW WITH MR. LIPTON'S book we begin to understand through the science of cell biology why that happens, and as Traditional Chinese Medical practitioners have said for centuries, \\"when the patient understands how and why the therapy works, the therapy works more effectively.\\"  After reading this powerful book, anyone practicing Tai Chi, Qigong (Chi Kung), Yoga, or Meditation will likely see their practice become even more powerfully beneficial because the energy of their thoughts will more deeply resonate the knowing that their practice is affecting their cellular systems in a very real and tangible way.  THANK YOU Bruce Lipton.
B000068TPN|5.0|I am a current military wife, my husband is on his second tour in Iraq and I have to say this is one of the only war movies out there that correctly portrays what we wives go through. I Love the authenticity of the women and men in this movie. I may have not been alive during this war but from what I have heard from my elders who have experienced it...this is the real thing. I can watch this movie millions of times and still feel the same way i did the first time. Thank you to all of those vets who have made this nation the way it is today. And thank you to all of the women who stood behind them and kept it real back home.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book in 6th grade as an assignment, and have revisited it every year yet.  All my peers loved it, and everyone i know who's read it loves it also.  It is a great book for children and adults alike.  Lowry is a fantastic writer, she brings this book alive for you and although deemed a children's book, adults will love it also.  It really brings up issues and makes you think, but some children (up to about 10 or 11) might not totally grasp the depth of this book at the first read.
0786856297|4.0|Rick Riordan steps into the world of children's publishing after a successful adult writing career with the very well imagined new fantasy adventure; \\"The Lightning Thief\\".  Percy Jackson is a 12 year old boy who up until he finds out that he is a half-blood (the son of a mortal and a god), thought that he was just a stupid loser with ADHD who kept getting thrown out of boarding school after boarding school.  After a disaster filled year at his latest boarding school where he accidentally vaporizes his evil math teacher; Percy finds out that his best friend Grover is a Satyr, discovers the wonderful Camp Half-Blood where kids like him go for the summer to train against monsters, and also that he is accused of something so terrible that it just might cause the war of all wars between the gods.  Percy is a realistic character who has a tougher edge than most fantasy characters out there with a sardonic undertone.  He's been through a lot of bullying at his many schools and he's no whimp which makes reading about his adventure all of the more exciting.  The supporting characters however are not as realistic and 3-dimensional.  Grover the Satyr and Annabel, a daughter of Athena, accompany Percy on his adventure to stop the war between the gods and that seems to be the only reason that they are there; to make a trio.  They do have some back story that makes them almost interesting, but not enough to reach the caliber of Percy.  The real power of this story that makes it so great is the element of Greek mythology that has never really played a main part in books before as much as it does in this one.  The creativeness that Riordan uses to blend the mythology with modern times is what really makes this book enjoyable for all children everywhere.  This book is a great original read for kids, with a movie version already on the way.  Although it has some flaws, it is very enjoyable, action packed, and full of creative ways that modernize the classic Greek myths.  Children everywhere are sure to be clamoring for the sequel.
0060007737|5.0|First, you have to understand why some brands are successful and others are not..This is the right book for that purpose. I am sure that you will get some critical hurdles for creating your own one. <br />
0553062182|5.0|In the short time since I have owned this book, it has explained some of the most unexplainable contradictions in my life and helped to provide solutions, including for a sleep disorder.  I have recommended it to several others who are all reporting the same thing.  In the vast field of self-help books, I have never come across one which addresses this topic.  Dr. Aron's website has a quick self-test and for those who suspect they are HSP, I would urge you to get this book as soon as possible.  It is truly life altering.
B00006LLOB|5.0|I don't get all the criticism for this collection.  It is a beautifully put-together collection of one of the best blues collaboration with British rockers.  I thought this CD is stellar - both discs.  There are not many recordings where you get to hear the musical giants we admire conversing among each other in the midst of a jam session.  This alone makes this set extra-special:  the conversations during Red Rooster and Who's Been Talking false starts.  The sound quality is superb.  I thought it was remarkable in its own right that these guys were even able to cut such a record within something like a week.  Playing with new people in unfamiliar environments can easily wreck a musician's ability to perform well.  I was amazed that it was possible to get the right set of musicians together in such a hurry and work out their differences.  I think when you take into account all the adversity that these people faced to make this record, you get amazed at what sort of musical talent was gathered for this record.  The remixes and alternate takes on the 2nd CD are great.  In fact, I like a few of them better than the originals.  My favorite songs are \\"I Aint Superstitious\\", \\"Rockin' Daddy\\", \\"Poor Boy\\", \\"Red Rooster\\", and \\"Goin' Down Slow\\".  But it's kind of hard to pick - I love all the songs on both the discs.  And I thought the producer did great with splicing in the horn arrangements later on - in my opinion, they were quite tastefully done.  The Keyboards that were added later on also provide a soft, classy touch to already great music.
B000002AS3|2.0|what the hell is it with americans? why cant they like GOOD music?> this band is awful, theres only one good song on this and that's the anthemic live forever, which is about the closest they got to a decent tune. every other song is idiotic, bash you over the head with a repeated riff rock that shouldn't ever be compared to the beatles EVER. the gallagher brothers are crap, in their attitude, their look and their songs. this is crappp. morning glory is a good album i admit, and that will be the only reason people care about them,,,,accept and move on
B000929AJQ|4.0|there is no truer statement than this when thinking of \\"with teeth\\".  its also something that few fans seem to realize.  not everyone can be like Kurt Cobain and go out (er, so to speak)in their prime, leaving behind a few samples of amazing youthful angst that still inspire generations of teens.  if trent renzor had dissapeared after \\"the downward spiral\\" he would be a hero and his music would be legend.  but he's still here, he still wants to make music, and too many people give him hell over that.    <br /> <br />personally i have a lot of respect for this album. trent's trying to combine his prior works while coming from the mindset of someone who has kicked the negative forces in their life.  the combination is far from perfect.  but it does have this amazing nack to grow on you.  the first time i heaRD with teeth i thought it was decent, but plain.  But i listened to it more and more, and after about 5 times i really liked it.  its sort of like \\"pretty hate amchine\\" in that its a collection of songs, not so much a long story.  this is kind of a good thing.  it makes it so you can pick out tracks you like, and so the whole thing doesn't seeem to drag (for instance you have to have patience when listening to the fragile as a whole, and (though i do love that record) that's something that i'm not always up for).   <br /> <br />as for the individual tracks on 'with teeth'.  there are heavy songs, and eery songs and boring songs.  so everything really.  if you like the singles ('the hand that feeds', 'only') then there are definately 5 or so songs that are reminisent of these.  the latter half of the album is ok.  its not memorable.  Except the final track which is very cool, a lot like \\"hurt\\" but still with its own individual beauty.   <br /> <br />in all this is a good rock-industrial record.  i think die hard NIN fans will injoy it.  others may be hesitant, it all depends.  don't expect 'the down ward spiral', but don't think that means this is crap.  you just have to appreciate that trent's sober and happy (god forbid!!!).  people's music will always change as they get older.  just accept it for what it is and what it means to you.

B00007AJF9|5.0|This movie is in my personal list of the top twenty films of the Nineties decade. A superb script supports a dramatic and decisive historic period in England.<br /><br />The hard conditions in which Elizabeth an impure heiress of the British Throne; in the middle of political turbulence signed by tacit agreements, pacts. Her painful access, after be injured and almost sentenced to death  by her own half sister. The daughter of Ana Bolena who was decapitated by Henry VIII, will be under the pressure of all nature to get married and so to hold a major political stability: the fury of Maria de Guisa and the power appetencies of Norfolk Duke, her sentimental disappointments, her sense of living in the most absolute void without being able to trust in practically no adviser, and the gradual transformation, personality and emotional intelligence and maturity that these wounds and disenchants generated are impeccably told by a elegant and sober handle camera, a discrete golden illumination, custom design, an impressive make up triumph, an enviable artistic direction and a glorious cast make of this artwork one of the diamantine jewels in years.<br /><br /> I haven't recovered yet about the denied Academy Award to Cate Blanchet for this performance. But certainly I don't want talk about sad things. Please watch and enjoy this superb film and then convince by yourself about the towering acting of Blanchet. And Geoffrey Rush as his most reliable adviser.<br /><br />Elizabeth ruled according Machiavellian principles; but overthrew all the possible obstacles, and allowed England to display all the hidden potential.<br /><br />My only complaint about this brilliant picture is in the dialogue's first lines between Queen Mary and Elizabeth, Mary affirms she is dying of cancer: Well, well, Did it exist this term in 1554? Hard to believe don't you?
B000268QB2|4.0|They're great. They have awesome lyrics and a mellow fell. The only thing that was off putting about this album was the fact that they sound so much like Coldplay. Apart from the flasetto there's little separating them from Coldplay. Other than that there's no reason why you shouldn't buy this. It was so awesome. You totally give them a try.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I would recommend this version of The Phantom of the Opera to anyone who is deeply moved by romance, pain, passion, beauty, love, and music.  Gerard Butler gives an oscar-worthy performance as the Phantom, particularly in the scene on the roof, when he picks up the rose Christine rejects, and, again, at the end, when she places the ring in his hand.  I think because he does not sing the way Michael Crawford did in the stage version, his performance in this classic Beauty and the Beast tale, minus the happy ending - at least for the beast, has been less than fully appreciated.    Emmy Rossum is magical, singing and acting with equal beauty and skill.  Patrick Wilson is the perfect Raoul, brave with the sword but not always sensitive to the danger in which he places Christine.  He has a fine voice and performs the role admirably.  Miranda Richardson, head of the ballet at the opera house gives a stellar performance as keeper of the phantom's secret.  Minnie Driver, as the opera diva, and Ciaran Hines, as one of the new owners, provide humor, perfectly balancing the movies serious theme.    How can anyone say enough about the power of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  Words are simply inadequate.  It is beyond extraordinary.  He and Joel Shumacher, as producer and director, remained true to Gaston Leroux's original novel, The Phantom of the Opera.  I cannot fathom that anyone buying this video or dvd version could be disappointed.  It is simply wonderful.      Frances
0895260131|5.0|If Robert Spencer is really so wrong, let \\"moderate\\" Muslim groups prove him so by expressly renouncing the ideology of aggressive jihad and the desire to impose sharia on the whole world.  Let's hear it -- without any weasel words or evasions of the kind for which they're known.  Let's hear an express disavowal.  It will never come, and that's confirmation enough of what Spencer is saying. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the book's playful title: this book raises serious and important questions about Islam that cannot go unanswered any longer.  And you don't have to believe Robert Spencer, since for most of his claims he simply quotes prominent Muslims. <br /> <br />Suppose 19 of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity had flown planes into buildings.  Christian groups would have been front and center in the relief efforts and in UNAMBIGUOUSLY denouncing such terrorism.  Years later they'd still be denouncing it at every opportunity, leaving NO opportunity for wiggle room in their statements. <br /> <br />Muslims who are upset about the image of Islam in our day need to do something more than condemn Robert Spencer.  They need to answer his arguments, and give us the unequivocal condemnations I mentioned above.  If they cannot do these things, then they have no right to complain about Islam's image.
B000002UAT|5.0|It was in 1966 The Beatles created what should be known as the first psychadelic rock album, entitled Revolver. The influence that particular album managed to garnish forced the Fab Four to pull all strings on their next studio effort, and the result was a revolutionizing masterpiece, which can be defined as the most influential album of all time. During the time of its release, The Beatles were competing with a stardom filled music industry, which included most importantly The Beach Boys, who had just released what many call the greatest pop album of all time, Pet Sounds, who Brian Wilson ironically said was influenced to produce from listening to Revolver.<br /><br />Perhaps Sgt. Pepper's created so much praise for the first three tracks alone, but nevertheless this an album of many experimental, fascinating and imaginative tunes, which each have their own element, or charesteristic to differ it from the next. That is in my mind what will always seperate The Beatles from The Beach Boys. Their continuous search and strive for recording fresh songs embracing different sounds to them, and over the years they shifted their sound drastically with a great deal of effective artistic experimentation. Meanwhile, although \\"Pet Sounds\\" was their most ambitious, passionate recording, The Beach Boys never experimented with any new musical styles. So reaches Sgt. Pepper, and the review of the music that lies on this album.<br /><br />Opening with the self-titled rocker which explores a plethora of heavier sounds while incorporating crowd noise, it is a genuine album opener, and is easily one of their best. This track makes a smooth transition to the cheery \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\". A masterful pyschadelic trip follows, with Lennon painting brilliant sound scopes through our ears in \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\". \\"Getting Better\\" is a satisfying pop-flavoured song, with a sing-a-long chorus. Fixing A Hole features some of the best guitar work on the album, and follows appropriately. She's Leaving Home poses similarities to the Beatles early-era of ensemble singing, while also bearing an illustrious melody. \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\" is an album highlight for its carnivalesque feel and beautiful vocal. Within You, Without You is like \\"Love You To\\" part two. A trippy acid soaked track, with superb citar. \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is the most delightful track on the songlisting, with very digestable verses. The reprise of the self-titled track was an exceptional idea, and it effectively shifts to the ultimate epic song, A Day In The Life. The dark, passionate feel to this song makes it(in my opinion) the greatest to ever be recorded in music history. The moving vocal and lyrics, the enrapturing melody, the concept, and the orchestral dynamic explosion at the end leaves me in awe everytime, and is solely worth the price of the album.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that The Beatles had an artistic vision while producing this album, and it comes together like no other, changing the face of music for eternity. Essential by all means, and a work that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone with ears. Recommended along with any other album in the Beatles Catalog with the exception of Yellow Submarine.<br /><br />Note: Sgt. Pepper's IS NOT my favourite Beatles album...ly.

B0007P3582|1.0|Seriously, everybody who actually listens to this crap is seriously retarded, im sorry, but you are. Rap (or cRAP) is probably the worst genre, but wait, would it even be considered a genre? id think not, since i wouldnt even consider it music at all, i mean people talking into a microphone with some fake drumbeat and (...) \\"turntable\\" sounds or whatever you call them..that is not music. Rap, Hip-hop, Disco, Dance, Pop, Emo, and Goth \\"music\\" are seriously a joke. If you want real music, try Nirvana, Metallica, Queens Of The Stone Age, HIM, System Of A Down, Guns N Roses, Velvet Revolver, Foo Fighters (even though theyre an MTV band), Iron Maiden, Judas Preist, Static X, Murderdolls, Fuel, Avenged Sevenfold, Alter Bridge, Misfits, non-american idiot Green Day, CKY, Rancid, Ramones, NOFX...well i think you get the point. before you start bad-mouthing real rock, you should actually try listening to it first. Has anyone ever looked at other reviews by \\"MTV rocks\\"? His Guns N Roses review for \\"Appetite for destruction\\" was so retarded. I almost smashed my computer screen, but at the same time almost died  laughing of his stupidity and knowledge of music. He said that they dont look anything like the MTV fags so they must suck. HES NEVER EVEN HEARD THEM!!! Plus he called Steve Vai a poser, plus classic artists (Mozart, Vivaldi, Beethoven, etc), plus he said that Kurt Cobain (even though hes one of my biggest role models) is the best guitarist ever and said the Teen Spirit solo is the most amazing thing hes ever heard. He also said that Nirvana saved rock in the 90's. I mean, even though they're one of my favorite bands and pure amazing, they actually killed rock because everyone afterwards tried to write songs like Kurt, but sadly failed at it. Other fag bands include Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Simple Plan, etc....Its pretty sad how (...) people are these days because of their retardedly stupid opinions on music. Anyways, i think im done here for now.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath will always be considered tops in the genre of metal, but the most impressive aspect to their music, is while it does feature awesome head-banging songs, it also merits some impressive lyrical qualities, strong musicality, and powerfully catchy riffs. Paranoid captures the band at their prime, and is without a doubt their best release. Now, to review some of the classic metal on the album.<br /><br />War Pigs is a brutal opener, with strong, almost over-powering guitar riffs, making it an immediate highlight. Paranoid remains popular, and rightfully so with its intense, and at times melodic feel to it. Planet Caravan is a dark, distorted track with a deep, soothing guitar solo, containing a slightly Eastern feel. Iron Man is the second big Sabbath hit on the album after the self-titled track, with a drum pounding introduction into a fiery rocker, featuring a sensational, and immediately catchy guitar hook. The lyrics aren't by any means genius, but they don't have to be as they are simply a device adding to the rawness of the track. Electric Funeral has a lower-key riff, with threatening lyrics, making it a scary rocker. Hand Of Doom has the most powerful drums of any track on the list, with solid verses too, and quick changes of pace, both in tempo and dynamics. Rat Salad is the shortest track on here. Does it leave the listener wanting more? Possibly, however it has effective soloing and classy instrumentation, to satisfy any metal fanatic and/or Sabbath fan. The album closer, Fairies Wear Boots has some impressive moments of soloing (that includes guitar and drums), and all-in-all rocks out pretty well.<br /><br />To conclude, no true metal fan should be without Paranoid, a metallic, riff-infused trip, which in many ways helped to define this genre. No song is worthy of a skip, and as for Sabbath fans, you can't call yourself one if you don't own a copy of this. Highly recommended. DON'T LISTEN TO LINKIN PARK!
B000002L68|5.0|I was in seventh grade the year Purple Rain came out. It was a time of making out with girls, riding my bike around the neighborhood after dark, hanging out with my best friends in our clubhouse, and just generally trying to gain more freedom from my parents. But the one thing that really stands out about this formative year is how much my friends and I utterly loved Purple Rain and its accompanying soundtrack. Stretching an extension chord from the garage to our clubhouse, my friends and I would watch the movie and listen to the soundtrack just about every Friday night for that summer. While probably somewhat of a bizarre thing to admit now, it was truly a great time which I'll never forget.  <br /> <br />As it stands today, the Purple Rain Soundtrack is still one of the best albums I've ever heard. The nostalgic qualities it possesses after just a few notes into \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" are very powerful to me and remind me of those days camping out in the backyard on weekends. And I could even care less if Prince ever made another album after Purple Rain. It's the one! Sign of the Times was a fair effort, granted, and his first couple albums have charming appeal, but everything after Sign of the Times just missed the boat or ventured too far into insipid R&B territory. <br /> <br />So what exactly is it that makes Purple Rain so much more enjoyable than the rest of his catalog? What makes it the indisputable stand-out? For me, I think it has a lot to do with the Revolution's sound. They had a huge influence on the aesthetic of Prince's early albums, particularly from the input of Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman (a/k/a Wendy & Lisa). Furthermore the production and instruments used by this group of musicians were less polished than what you'd hear from Prince today. And therein lies the primary reason for his decline over time.    <br /> <br />The moment \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" opens with its funeral-esque keyboards and Prince's dialogue about life, there's a certain prevailing darkness. It remains until the ending moments of \\"Purple Rain,\\" which I'll get to in a moment. And even though this is a pop record by design, there isn't the sugary sweet coating typically associated with this sort of music.  <br /> <br />\\"Computer Blue\\" is another Purple Rain highlight. With a solo from Prince and an unobtrusive rhythm section, we get to hear the intricacies of his guitar skills. The song leads directly into the infamous \\"Darling Nikki.\\" It's usually a favorite among the female crowd, but I find it to be one of the best due to the screeching vocals that have become synonymous with Prince. \\"When Doves Cry\\" is self-explanatory. \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" shows the same keyboard flair Prince possessed when writing the music for Stevie Nicks' \\"Stand Back.\\" It glides along effortlessly and stands as one of the best tracks to grace this 40-minute experience. <br /> <br />Ending with Prince's most recognized song, \\"Purple Rain,\\" I can't help but declare this one of the most perfect pop songs ever recorded. It's been played to death and just about everyone knows it, but that doesn't mean a thing to me. I'm talking about a song that should never be mentioned without words like iconic, transcendent, or epic attached to it. It also happens to be a gripping part of the film, in which Prince dedicates its lyrics to his father who has just committed suicide. Very few songs have since matched its beauty or timelessness.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, I'd admit that it's inconsequential to review an album like the Purple Rain Soundtrack. It had such a huge impact on '80s culture and is still one of the most highly respected soundtracks in the history of our generation. It doesn't need press and it certainly doesn't need justification from me, but it's certainly worthy of celebration from time to time. And really, that's all I'm here to do. Well, that and maybe to relive my past a bit.
0060005696|1.0|Don't bother reading these praising reviewers; they're being paid by advertisers. This book is nonsense. I would recommend it to grade school pupils writing their first social studies paper. It consists of 90% common sense knowledge that every American consumer already knows, which he redundantly spews out with tedious examples chapter after chapter, and the rest is elementary social and economic vocabulary juxtaposed with a few statistics which are openly available to the public. Just another personal journal from a charlatan who landed a publishing deal. I can't believe this guy calls himself a professor.
B00000JTB2|3.0|Both Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King are royalty, and I am aware that criticizing either one of them is punishable by death.  What I am about to write is not a criticism.  I am merely saying that it is not among their best projects.<br /><br />Very mellow and slow paced. I'm not going to sing alabanzas about this CD. The selection could have been more energetic as well as the playing.<br /><br />Seeing SRV in concert or hearing his live performances via DvD, VCR or CD causes will cause your fists to clench and your eyes to squint. But this CD can't be compared to the driving excitement of SRV live.  It just doesn't have the excitement and electricity of their other releases.<br /><br />SRV and Albert King are great musicians and deserve all the praise they get, but compared to their other work, this CD is a yawner.<br /><br />If you like Stevie Ray Vaughan, then get Live at Montreaux or Live at Carnegie Hall.  A good studio album of his is Couldn't Stand the Weather.  If you like Albert King, then get Wednesday Night in San Francisco or Thursday Night in San Francisco.<br /><br />But, hey, if you like watered down studio performances, then get this CD or perhaps try Ashlee Simpson.
B00005JNZ4|2.0|I'm sad to say that this movie doesn't live up to even modest expectations.  Diane Lane and John Cusack are SUCH appealing performers, and the idea of the two of them paired in a romantic comedy was enough to make my wife and I eager to see the film on opening weekend.  We didn't expect Best Picture-like entertainment, but we did expect to laugh and enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br />The movie does have some laughs, no question.  But it has long stretches that simply are unbelievable enough that you are unable to suspend disbelief enough.  Many, many movies have similar plot holes:  for example, Lane's character lives in a beautiful, bungalow style home with exquisite furnishings.  She works for a day care.  Well, perhaps her ex-husband was rich?  Nope...a fireman.  Yet they could afford this sweet home.  John Cusack builds, by hand, row boats from wood.  Actually, I should say \\"boat\\" in the singular.  At the beginning of the movie, he's built one.  At the end of the movie, he's still looking to sell that FIRST boat.  Yet he lives in a large place with a large workshop...and pays alimony!  RIGHT!!!  I know a lot of romantic comedies expect us to believe ridiculous things...like Will Smith's character in HITCH could exist in real life, for example.  Yet we happily suspend our doubts because the characters are so appealing. <br /> <br />In MUST LOVE DOGS, our central characters are wrecks.  And in John Cusack's case, not very likeable ones.  He never smiles and he seems to have almost no internal censor on his speech...he just rattles on annoyingly.  I have always LOVED John Cusack...he's always a delight...HIGH FIDELITY, SAY ANYTHING, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY...heck, even BETTER OFF DEAD.  But he actually wears out his welcome in this film.  Dermot Mulroney plays a \\"we're trying it apart\\" separated dad who puts the moves on Lane...and we can see almost right away that he's shallow and disingenuous.  He's looking forward to trying the life of the bachelor again.  Yet Lane develops an interest in him, and pursues him even when she believes he can't be trusted.   <br /> <br />Lane is pretty good in the film, but her character is a bit ill-defined.  She feels like a retread of her UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN character, before finding the healing Italian climate.  Her \\"laugh\\" lines often feel delivered like a piece of standup...not as actual human thoughts.  She's a highly appealing actress, and her innate appeal keeps the movie afloat.  Not much else does. <br /> <br />Christopher Plummer, as her father, is charismatic and totally unbelievable.  A father like he is would never have children like he does.  Elizabeth Perkins, as Lane's meddling sister, is totally unappealing and unlikable.  If she were MY sister, I'd smack her.  And Perkins is usually so tart and funny...here's she's just irritating.  The wonderful Stockard Channing simply looks WEIRD...what did they do to her??  I thought she was a man in drag! <br /> <br />Speaking of drag...why do all single women who feel doomed to a life alone have a wonderful gay couple as their best, most understanding friends?  It's become a chiche now in these films that the leading lady confides primarily with a male gay friend.  And the friend is always the most warm, understanding, caring person in the film.  It's beginning to stretch credulity. <br /> <br />We did have some good laughs in the scenes were Lane and Cusack are trying to find an open store where they can buy a condom.  That's funny and actually feels a little believable...even though it borders on slapstick.  It's funny, original and has some energy.  Lane has some funny encounters with butcher at her grocery store...cute but very short.  And one or two of her \\"first-time\\" dates are funny, but forgettable.  The whole movie...sadly, is forgettable. <br />

0790729652|5.0|It seems Burton and Keaton had a good time together in 1988 with Beetlejuice and decided to team up a year later with Batman. Good call! Michael Keaton plays The Dark Knight in this deliciously gloomy take on the caped crusader of Gotham City. The film begins right in the middle of Gotham's seemingly hopeless ring of crime as Batman drops in for a butt-kicking session with a couple of crooks. And before long, he faces off with Jack Napier at Axis Chemical. Through a freak accident, Napier falls into a vat of toxic chemicals. He is presumed dead, yet actually escaped through the sewer system. He survived, but not without a price. His skin is bleached chalk-white, his haired dyed green, and his facial nerves severed, creating a permanent ruby-red grin. Batman must now face the man he thought was dead, as Napier (now known as The Joker) unleashes pure chaos throughout Gotham with his deadly Smilex gas. The Joker has lost his mind and wants to destroy Gotham, and especially Batman. Thrown in the mix is Vicky Vale, caught in between Batman and the Joker. So not only must Bruce Wayne save Gotham, but also his new love who is oblivious to his hidden superhero identity.<br /><br />It is absolutely undeniable that Nicholson stole this movie and ran with it. He fit the part so naturally well, managing to throw in his own style for The Joker. Tim Burton certainly noticed this, as he gave about half of the scenes to The Clown Prince Of Crime. But, while Nicholson may be the main reason in my opinion to see \\"Batman\\", he's not the only reason. Obviously stretching far from the squeaky clean Adam West era, here we get the darker side of Gotham -- as well as a darker vision of Batman. Burton's visual style, mixed with Elfman's brilliant score, is a formula for a wonderful cinematic treat that everyone should see at least once. And if you're a fan of Batman (or the Joker, heheh), then you'll be watching it until the DVD wears out. Five Stars, Two Thumbs Up, and one big maniacal last-laugh for Batman!or Batman!
B000002LRX|4.0|An intelligent and creative mixture of sound and fury. Patton and pals tear through both the beautiful and brutal in this astonishing effort. Very original and effective with inspired vocals and musicians who were on a mission and struck a bulls eye. Bravo (4.7)
B000002UDB|5.0|At first glance, I thought I was looking at a Banana Splits album.  Little did I know within the cartoonish album artwork were the star-studded encryption of BEATLES embedded within the front of the record.  MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is the album between the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band masterpiece and the WHITE ALBUM (that is, if you don't count yet another cartoon contribution, YELLOW SUBMARINE, that contained previously released material as well as a couple of new compositions and the movie's soundtrack).  This record is the record after Brian Epstein's death, which compiled singles and EP material into one package.  From a broad perspective, this is the record that represents the Beatles' continuous musical transition, experimentation, and maturation.  The album's tracks offer a glimpse of things to come.<br /><br />The unforgettable songs on MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album speak for themselves.  This is the record that highlights post-Beatlemania and the \\"what next\\" after Sgt. Pepper -- where they've been and where they were going.  This is no doubt the continuum of Sgt. Pepper, and by no means the end of their creativity.  When one speaks of innovation, just listening to \\"I am the Walrus\\" shows the creative and poetic gibberish that John Lennon was known to display, and he basically did a little \\"rapping\\" throughout the song.  The songs resonate a time and place with mentions of John and Paul's post-World War II childhood and the places where they lived and played - \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  The psychedelic tone of \\"Flying\\" shows the song's straight-forwardness of time and measure and credits each band member's contribution to the composition.  The remaining tracks offer a sense of showmanship with its whimsical \\"the show must go on\\" type of attitude.  The songs,\\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and the title track, \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" present a quandary that existed amidst the summer of love and drug hallucinations that came with \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"All You Need is Love,\\" and the beginning of another chapter of the Beatles' musical journey \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Hello Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is a record that any Beatles aficionado should not miss as well as for anyone who would like to understand the evolution of the Beatles' music.  Word to the wise, listen to this record before venturing out to watch the DVD of the same name.

B000002HEP|4.0|A solid sounding symphony of melody and mayhem. The space between the notes act as a tendril seeming to lure the ear torwards some unseen oasis. Each listen seemed only to increase the infectiousness of this music. Beware the addiction of kyuss. (4.5)
B00005JNBQ|4.0|After reading the first 100 reviews of ND, I am perplexed by all of the hatred expressed towards this movie.  Hey folks, it's just a movie and a funny one at that.  A lot of the humor can be subtle and sophisticated (which takes the movie beyond most of the under-13 crowd), but it is a well made film and pushes a lot of buttons as far as high school memories (especially if you were a nerd). <br /> <br />One aspect of the movie largely unmentioned is the excellent soundtrack, particularly the \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra which is heard after Napoleon's dance sequence.  I think the choice of this piece of music is inspired brilliance and is one of the best musical \\"fits\\" in movie history.  However, for some reason, this track is not included on the movie's soundtrack CD.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|XXX state of the union reminds me of those old 80's action flims that had the main hero flying over helicopters, survive many explosions, survive a barrage of bullets, and escape death about 30 times and then at the end all he has is a little scratch on his cheek. That my friends, is XXX:state of the union.    Ice Cube plays the role of XXX this time and i really wish Vin diesel would have not been so damn greedy and just accepted the offer that the XXX production company was offering him to be in this sequal.  With a government themed conspiracy plot that would make tom clancy  break into tears of laughter, XXX 2 has William Dafoe playing an evil Secretary of defense who has a plan to Kill the president and the vice President during the night that the president is delivering the state of the union address, Alas the title XXX:state of the union.    So Big time War Criminal Ice cube is chosen to be the new XXX by his old commander(Samuel L jackson) and must team up with Xzibit from pimp my ride and a NSA agent and convicts and try to stop this evil plot themselves.    The Negatives-One big negative of this movie is ICE CUBE!!!!!  Come on Ice cube as XXX?? the big bad XXX? Ice Cube??  If this movie was real life Ice Cube would have had a heart attack in the first 5 minutes of action, as he looks kind of on the chunky side, even though he does have muscle, Ice Cube is not Action hero material.    Reality check- Okay now i know this is a movie, and movies stretch reality sometimes but COMEON, this movie breaks the rules of reality and it makes the movie seem very fake and it takes away from the experience.  I'll give you 2 examples!    1-XXX must have a new gadget it's called BULLET PROOF BUBBLE!  Ice cube is swimming away while bullets are being shot at him and 20 bullets whiz by his head, legs, and sides and not EVEN ONE hits him????? COME ON!!!!    2-I didnt know Cars can ride like trains if you put them on traintracks. XXX is chasing this high speeding train and what does he decide to do? of course he throws his car on the traintracks and goes so fast that the tires burn off and only his rims are left and his car is going as fast as the train on the railroad.YEAH RIGHT.  I'm on a roll i'll give you one more example!    3-XXX has been through war world 4, has survived gunfights, knifefights,explosions,car accidents and at the end he only has a little scratch on his face?? a scratch? just a little BOO-BOO?  Wow he really must be tough.    Another thing this movie should have been called  XXX:Pimp my ride Edition.  Xzibit??? Xzibit is going to save the country with ICE CUBE?  hahahahahahahahahaha  And with all the cars that were being modded and showcased i swear i thought i rented a movie of pimp my ride.    Positives-I did like the scene where XXX breaks out of prison with Ice cube running on rooftops and reaching for helicopter in midair(even though it was unreal but hey it looked cool)  and the opening scene with the NSA agency being attacked was good.Also when a very annoying character gets finally killed i was so glad.    Conclusion-Bad Casting, Unreal action scenes even by movie standards, Cliche' action movie ending is XXX:state of the union. Rent if you want some good laughs though.    2 stars out of 5    The Opinionated One has Spoken
B0008G2IRO|3.0|The music CD was good and I enjoyed the overall selection of songs.  The \\"Bonus DVD\\" however was a real disappointment.  Only one song video and a bunch of \\"interactive games\\" that were more marketing oriented and a waste of time (I don't want or need a discount on buying the Gorillaz action figures!)  Buy the CD - don't waste your time and money on the DVD/CD package.
B000002JS6|2.0|this only got 2 stars because its the best album by acdc... which isnt saying much. they are soooo overrated its not even funny. angus young is a terrible guitarist. this album is full of crappy commercial songs with simple riffs, horrible vocals, and subpar soloing. do not waste your money and time getting this album, its a disgrace to rock n roll. if you want real rock... where they actually can play their instruments... go pick some beatles, hendrix or rolling stones. two stars and lucky to get that.
006441034X|5.0|I got Howl's Moving Castle for my girlfriend and myself since we loved the movie. The book is excellent and quite different from the movie. So even if you think you know the story it is worth checking out. My only problem with the story was that the ending was very convoluted, I had to reread the last few pages to figure out who was doing what. Otherwise the story was very enganging and the characters likable. I think the story will please both children and adult fans of fantasy.
B00004W510|5.0|\\"The Band\\" was the Band's second album, and probably their most consistent and influential. At the time of its release in 1969 nothing quite like it was heard before; apart from, of course,  their first album \\"Music From Big Pink\\", which is as close as it gets to being an equally strong release.<br /><br />What makes the Band's early album so great is the simple fact that they have it all. Great songs, concerned lyrics, 3 outstanding lead-singers, brilliant musicians, inventive arrangements and tight playing.<br /><br />All songs on this album are very memorable, many of them classics like \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", \\"Across the Great Divide\\" and \\"Up On Cripple Creek\\".<br /><br />Some of the quieter song that may not hit you the first times you listen to them, may grow to be favourites like they did for me. \\"When You Awake\\" and \\"Rockin' Chair\\" belong to that category. A shame the Richard Manuel eventually lost faith in himself as a songwriter, but on this album he still contributes to the song-writing on songs like \\"Whispering Pines\\", \\"Jawbone\\" and \\"When You Awake\\".<br /><br />He may have felt it too burdening to live up to Robertson's prolific songwriting.<br /><br />The bonus track features the great outtake \\"Get Up Jake\\", known from the \\"Rock of Ages\\" live album.<br /><br />The other bonus songs are alternate versions of songs on the original; all interesting and most of them almost as good as the originally released versions.<br /><br />A highly recommended album!
B000002UAU|5.0|A superb album. Used to listen to it non-stop when making jigsaws with my Dad when I was young. Brings back fantastic memories. <br /> <br />To enjoy it properly, leave it a few years before you listen to it again. The longer you leave it, the more you enjoy hearing it again!
B000002JS6|1.0|How can you people say that ac/dc is good?How can you say they are legends?No,they aren't,they suck.Every single ac/dc song has the same sound to it.The difference between all their songs?The lyrics.Thats it,just the lyrics.Hells Bells sounds strangely familiar to Back in Black and wait!Haven;t I already heard you shook me all night long???I thought that was the first track on this cd!!!If no one sang on this cd I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between all the songs.ac/dc +overrated=sucky cd
B00097A5I6|2.0|This review is coming from a somewhat experienced Oasis fan.  I own 4 albums (this, morning glory, def. maybe, and heathen chemistry) and I consider this one to be the worst. <br /> <br />There are 2 reasons why I don't like this album: <br /> <br />1.  Noel's vocals are horrible.  Don't get me wrong, I love some of his other songs from past albums like \\"Don't look back in anger\\" and \\"Little by little\\" but his voice is very annoying a lot of the time and clashes with the music too much. <br /> <br />2.  I know Oasis rips off the beatles, but they do it WAAAY too much on this album.  I don't really like the beatles too much, but what oasis has done on past albums is taken some of the best parts of the beatles music and added a modern touch to it.  On this album... they just rip them off part for part. <br /> <br />3.  Those 60's style organs sound really dumb and are overused throughout the album. <br /> <br />As for the songs: <br /> <br />Lyla is a great song, by far the best on the album.  I know it's just a single and it's supposed to be catchy but that's what oasis does best.  It's one of their best hits yet and is almost worth the cost of the entire album. <br /> <br />Let There be Love is another good song but the organs ruin it.  If a guitar was used instead (ex: replace the organ solos with guitar solos) this track could've rivaled \\"Champagne Supernova\\" in terms of greatness. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is pretty much junk and that's all I have to say.  Save your money and buy the Lyla single.
B0002O06N0|5.0|This album is in the great tradition of stripped down rock like The White Stripes (before their latest crap album), yet it's much more focused in it's attack than most of the retro rock that seems so afraid to be placed into a genre that it all ends up bluring into ambiguity. This album is unapologetically Blues Rock. Not that it's unoriginal. It just is what it is. Flat out, warm tubes and a funky drum kit laying down thick, crunchy songs.       <br />   <br />There are definately a few misses on the album. The first track is an easy pass, as are a couple tracks in the middle where the guy just goes on and on with lyrics like, \\"hey hey hey hey hey,\\" and \\"girl is on my mind, girl is on my mind...\\" but with the exception of those everything else will find you either: a) wishing you knew how to play electric guitar or drums, b) wishing you knew how to play electric guitar or drums better, or c) wishing you could spend the rest of the day jumping up and down around the house and striking your best rock star poses while singing along to lines like \\"you've got pains/like an addict/ten a.m. automatic!\\" (10 A.M. Automatic) or \\"saw you talkin'/heard the sounds/but you just couldn't tie me down!\\" (Just Couldn't Tie Me down) or \\"Stack Shot Billy to the back of the head/Stack made sure Billy Lyons was dead/.45 pistol down in Stack's right hand/sent him away to the Promised Land\\" (Stack Shot Billy - probably the best song on the album, little dark, but very cool). <br />   <br />Dan Auerbach plays the guitar and sings. His guitar style isn't completely unique, but enough to where you find yourself constantly being pulled back by his simple, yet highly compelling riffs. His voice is very pleasant too. It's good on all of the songs, but I enjoy it's quality the most on the most gentle song on this album called The Lengths. It's a vulnerable country twinged love lament which opens with the lyric \\"tell me where you're goin'/or what is going wrong/I felt you leavin'/before you'd even gone.\\" If you're in the mood to feel completely sad while being romanced by a wonderful melody and lap steel, this is the song for you. Auerbach is in great voice, whether singing or playing guitar. <br />   <br />Patrick Carney is the drummer and all I can say is if you appreciate no-nonsense, but highly skilled drumming that sounds like it's coming from the garage next door, Carney delivers. He kicks ass. <br />   <br />That's all. I didn't give the album 5 stars because it's perfect. I gave it 5 stars because it's great, and the two aren't always the same thing. <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I heard this DVD when I was attending a meeting for my job and I was hooked.  I had to purchase it.  Every song on this DVD is great and never gets old.  I have let many of my friends and family listen to it and they also decided to get it.  If you like the Eagles, this is a must buy item!!
B00097A5HW|1.0|naaaaaaa This girl can't sing , i just like her into dancing! her dances Rocks! but is she a real singer?
B0009MAO46|5.0|I can't believe it's already been 10 years since Toy Story came out! I loved it then and I still do {along with the sequel}. Toy Story has wonderful animation which started the infamous computer-animated trend in kid movies, tons of great characters, and an original plot. The whole concept of toys talking and having 'lives' is so fun for any child..and adults alike :)  <br />Toy Story mixes humor, action, adventure, and even the tiniest bit of horror {that Sid kid is creepy!} ;] All the qualities needed to make an instant classic! <br />I would definately recommend this film to children of all ages!
B000A59PMO|5.0|... but she doesn't think you're stupid.   This is a fantastic new show that (unlike a lot of the current American tv), assumes it's viewers are intelligent people. It doesn't hold your hand, explain every detail, or dumb down the dialogue. The charactors are layered - flawed and human, but immensly likeable. While the script is superb, with a lot of emotional truth and biting wit, show creator Rob Thomas expects his actors to convey a lot with their acting, facial expressions and body movement.   Luckily they are up for the job. The whole cast, even the bit players, is great. Of particular note, star Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) is excellent in her role, portraying the strenth and vulnerability that embody her charactor with ease. Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), one of the best new actors on tv, is outstanding as a bitter young man lashing out (in a terrifically funny and snarky way) at the world around him. He and Francis Capra (Weevil) both overflow with charisma.   Watch Veronica Mars Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm on UPN (season 2 starts September 28th), and buy the DVD set, because this one show you will want to watch again.
079284131X|5.0|This is a horror classic! You need this in your collection. Wonderful, creative movie plot. Very clever thinking! Also, pick up a copy of Child's Play 2!
B0007XT87G|5.0|You know really all that I can tell you is that if you are new to this band and you hear it you become hooked. I let 5 people listen to this CD and they all loved it. The music is in so many different layers that its phenominal that it works and sort of incorporates some of the 60's harmonizing in to todays delivery. Its great seeing a band breaking away from the pack with its own unique sounds instead of playing it safe, in this case it paid off!! Some write-ups didn't appear happy I just know for each one that said no there had to be 25 that said yes. Awesome music!
6305508550|1.0|Do not buy this DVD if you are an aspect ratio purist. I believe this is one of those tragic cases where the FULLSCREEN version was cropped to create a fake widescreen version (as was done with Terminator 3) . You are getting a twice cropped film here, and thus, much less picture than the already cropped fullscreen version.  <br /> <br /> This \\"widescreen\\" version has chopped off heads in every shot and in a couple of scenes the characters are chopped off from left to right. NOT WHAT THE DIRECTOR FILMED. <br /> <br />The news is that Office Space Special Edition is due out in late 2005. Wait for it....HOPEFULLY it will be in the true theatrical release aspect ratio.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have listened to some of Green Day's prior work (Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod), and it is good but does not match the uniqueness and prestige of American Idiot. Yes, I know that after the release of this CD Green Day has been critisized for being sell-outs and hypocrits, but one must understand due to Green Day's popularity and the action's of today's music industries it is not surprising that a lot of publicity and hype has been attatched to this CD. I'm sure Green Day was aware that this would happen and was willing to take the gamble in order to share thier punk rock masterpeice with the world.  <br /> <br />I find this CD to be great mixture of deep lyrics and hard hitting instrumentals which help tell a story of one person's journey through a society of chaos and revolution. Listing to Billy Joe's voice, Tre Cool's amazing drumming, and Mike Drint's stellar bass playing makes the listener feel as if he/she is experiencing the emotion going on through the main character's head.  <br /> <br />Although some may be weaker than others each song has a place within the CD and does not seem, at all, like a track filler. Some of my favorite songs include \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Tales of Another Broken Home\\", and \\"Extraordianary Girl\\", but because each song is so unique and tells such a diferent part of the story it's hard to pinpoint an exact favorite. In other words if you buy this CD you will not get bombarded with songs that are eerily similar and boreing. <br /> <br />American Idiot is a CD that packs a punch. It will satisfy any Green Day fan who enjoys their work from the 90's and will hook anyone who is not familiar with the band, but is willing to give them a listen. I defintely feel Green Day has delievered much more than a punk rock CD when they released American Idiot, and I am very eager and hopefull for an even better follow up. <br /> <br />
B0002WYS6S|5.0|<br />Yes, you read it!!!... It is the best DVD Album of Dream Theater.  But As I have no money I can`t buy it :-( ....  You can realize the frustation for a Dream Theater's fan since there isn't the available money to buy it new.  <br />So if anyone of you could colaborate sending to me a original LIVE AT BUDOKAN DVD, I will appreciate it very much.  If you want to help me, pls send it to this address:  16373 SW 27TH ST MIRAMAR FL 33027.    <br /> <br />Thanks in Advance. <br />
B000002J09|5.0|We all recognize the tunes, they defined rock and roll forever.  I admit, I didn't start listening to rock or metal until I was about 14 or 15, I was more of a modern rock and pop fan (I don't listen to either anymore), Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Extreme (aah!), and Red Hot Chili Peppers introduced me to rock music.  In Spring 1992, I didn't even know what \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was nor did I care, I started listening to Z-Rock in Houston in Fall 1992 after hearing Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\" and Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", little did I know that while listening to the now defunct rock station that I would be exposed to such diverse acts as Blue Oyster Cult, Rush, AC/DC, and Megadeth to name a few, but most notably of all Zeppelin.  I came to identify and love almost all of the tracks on Led Zeppelin IV (or Zoso, as it is sometimes referred) by listening to them numerous times while doing my homework and chores around the house. <br /> <br />My favorite track on this album is of course \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", it really defines the spirit of rock and roll in its purest form.  Robert Plant's mellow, then electrifying vocals show overwhelming range and ability to send shivers down your spine, and Jimmy Page's divine guitar work make \\"Stairway\\" the best and most identifiable rock and roll song of the 20th Century.  It's a shame, with the passing of John Bonham in the late '70s, that the world will never see the original lineup again.  Page and Plant, when they tour together anyway, still show signs of brilliance in their now much advanced age.   <br /> <br />I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys good rock and roll, you can listen to it all the way through, and leave it on repeat, it never gets old even after all this time.
0895260131|5.0|An absolute must-read for those interested in the so-called War On Terror, shows step-by-step, with historical accurracy, how Islam is not the Religion of Peace that President Bush claims.<br />With an exploding Muslim population in Canada this book should be a wake-up call for an end to high immigration laws.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|All of my music listening habits rotate around my ipod and itunes music library. Whilst i am sure this is a great album, i refuse to pay for a CD in which i will actually not have full ownership rights to. <br /> <br />basically, If I pay for it, then i expect to be able to listen to it in anyway i please, otherwise i will just turn to Kazaa for assistance. It's as simple as that!
0684803356|5.0|Poor Papa has become such a caricature, it is easy to forget that he was the source and inspiration for countless writers.  On rereading For Whom the Bell Tolls, I was reminded of what thrilled me long ago when one could speak of \\"serious\\" fiction without ironic intent.         Exoticism       All of Hemingway's work has an exotic locale with an unusual American driving the narrative.  In this novel, Robert Jordan, a professor from Montana, is a demolition operative with a group of guerillas in the Spanish Civil War.  He lives in the mountains, eats rabbit stew with partisans, is fluent in the dialect, makes love with a senorita in his sleeping bag, destroys bridges with steely skill and faces death with aplomb.           Style       Hemingway's direct and lucid style is in full form.  It sounds great when read aloud.  Nobody did it better.         In this novel, much of the dialogue is memorable because of the literal translation from peasant Spanish.  No English speakers would carry on as they do, and the arcane cant with its earthy directness permeates the whole novel.         In 1940, Hemingway was unable to use 4-letter curses.  He had to substitute the word \\"obscenity\\" or \\"nameless\\" yielding something like \\"I obscenity in the milk of your nameless mother.\\"  Well, it's not very shocking, but I'm happy old Hem was stuck with that translation.  Had the Bell been fouled with English vulgarities, it would have come off today as quite common and the exoticism would be considerably dampened.         Women       Maria is Robert Jordan's love, but she is unremarkable as a character.  In those times, a warrior's love interest had to be air-headed and adulatory.  However, Pilar, the woman who commands the guerillas is an unforgettable person.  She is too fat and ugly to bed, but her skill as a story-teller and judge of people are superb.         Politics       In politics Hemingway was pro-peasant and he fought facists throughout Europe.  In his latter years he complained about J. Edgar Hoover tailing him, and perhaps it was not delusory.  Americans who assisted the Republicans (they were the good-guys in that time and place) were branded as Commies and were forever on the FBI trouble-maker list.  It was courageous of Hemingway to make a collaborator like Robert Jordan his hero.         Buddhist Touches       Robert Jordan is no monk, but he does live by some prime Buddhist principles.  He goes on for some length about living in the now- there may be no tomorrow.  Just before his death, he explains to the Maria that wherever she goes, so will he be there.  A mystical touch that cannot heal their parting.         And So       Read this novel to be transported to a time and place beyond the memory of all but the very old.  Human nature is displayed in the extreme- both base and uplifting.  It is one of the last great war novels that told its story without a blink.       Hemingway's appeal is not very complicated.  Growing up I knew some outdoorsmen and war heros, but they tended to be illiterate or mute.  I knew some good writers, but they tended to be bookish dweebs.  Ern could negotiate both camps, and he was the first writer to seize my attention.  I think he'll be charming readers for a long time.
B000687M48|5.0|This is a great CD! Harder rock, more songs, everything! I love two of the new songs(Farther Away and Thoughtless) I hate the other two  (Missing and Breathe No More) and I really like the way My Immortal has even harder rock at the end than on the radio. The other songs are well sung by Amy Lee and her true voice, and all in all this CD is quite worth your $15. 99 or whatever. The only thing I would, if I could, change about the much better \\"My Immortal\\" is that part of it where Amy Lee forces herself to be polite to the audience and let them sing the first chorus. If I could get the attention of the audience, I would thunder: \\"WILL ALL OF YOU JUST SHUT YOUR (BEEP)ING TRAPS AND LET THE POOR LADY SING THE SONG HERSELF!? I CAME HERE TO LISTEN TO HER, NOT YOU! YOU ARE ALL SO (BEEP)ING RUDE AND CRUDE AS SO TO FORCE HER TO LET YOU SING PART OF THE SONG THAT SHE CREATED WITH HER BAND! AND IF ANY OF YOU EVER (BEEP)ING DO THIS AGAIN, I'LL GO (BEEP)ING INSANE!!!!!!! LEAVE HER ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br />But, overall, this is a terrfic CD, and I recommed it to all of those who are Evanescence lovers. Anyway, I think you get me.
B00005JMX6|2.0|Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldnt find his car.    But seriously, there is a movie viewer segment of such limited intelligence that they have never been able to experience a movie that actually insulted their intelligence. I understand that \\"The Girl Next Door\\" was made as a public service to these viewers and deliberately featured a screenplay so dumbed-down that even those just slightly above the moron level could have their first-ever intelligence insulting viewing experience.    Start with a mix of \\"Risky Business\\" and \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\", extract all elements of intelligence and charm that characterized those films, and then further dumb-down the story as a public service to the brain-activity challenged members of the audience; and you have a good description of \\"The Girl Next Door\\".    But it sure has a nice promotional poster. Elisha Cuthbert looks good posing and she does a decent job playing Elisha Cuthbert (who just happens to be \\"The Girl Next Door\\"), but her range as an actress is too narrow to even be measured. Unfortunately for Cuthbert, \\"This\\" girl next door (a part most talented young \\"actresses\\" would love to play) is supposed to be a multi-dimensional character (for those in the target audience this means that the character is really two different people: \\"a girl next door\\" and a \\"young but hardened by experience porn star\\"). If you have seen the movie and are still confused don't be embarrassed, nothing in Cuthbert's performance would lead anyone to believe she is a \\"young but hardened by experience porn star\\". That is because Cuthbert herself is not a \\"young but hardened by experience porn star\\". She would have to \\"act\\" differently than \\"the girl next door\\" to communicate this dimensionality to the audience. To do this she would have to be an \\"actress\\".    So give Cuthbert credit for being able to pose for pictures and for being herself-she seems like a very nice girl that I would welcome as my neighbor. For some people that is enough, for those busy with the experience of having their intelligence insulted for the first time it is probably not important. The rest of us we would be hard pressed to find a worse way to spend our time.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Yeah this CD has some decent beats - so what.....thats the problem with rap fans nowadays, most just want a nice beat that they can shake their ass to in a club - lyrically the artist doesn't have to say a thing, which is the ONLY reason why this record has sold 4 million copies.  <br />50 Cent is a joke....anyone who has seen the MTV special \\"All Eyez on 50 Cent: The Sequel\\" knows what a sellout and hypocrite 50 really is. He tears into Ja Rule because he apparently makes girly songs and sings on records...then releases \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" and \\"Candyshop\\" (aka Magic Stick Pt 2), dancing and singing on both.....then he has a part in Yayo's single \\"So Seductive\\", and yep, you guessed it-he sings. Follows up by releasing the \\"Outta Control Remix\\", which he also sings on, not to mention that the video is a direct snatch of \\"In Da Club\\", Mobb Deep's \\"Get It Twisted\\", and countless other rap videos - if you are so great 50, why cant you come up with an original concept for your video?  <br />All of G-Unit is trash now that Game is out of the group - Olivia?! Who the F*** was the genius that decided to recruit an ugly Ashanti - yeah, that's REAL gangsta guys, add a second rate R&B singer to your lineup. Not to mention that \\"Twist It\\" is one of the worst songs I've ever heard and it has an even worse video (No surprise that 50 directed it). Game's CD is the best since Get Rich or Die Trying (see - this is why i, and numerous others, feel the need to tear apart 50 for his change of style - after an exceptional first major label debut, how do you put out such a piece of garbage?) and unfortunately, because they now have beef, most people who are \\"on 50 cent's side\\" will immediately write that CD off and not even give it a chance.......your loss. <br /> <br />Open your ears and hear the lack of talent that 50 Cent really has........G-G-G-G-G-G-UNOT!!!!!!!
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This is a must-have for everybody on Earth.  Its songs are incredible inspirational, like SWEATING BULLETS and SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION.  Even the name \\"Megadeth\\" is an inspiration to keep living.  I pump this baby through headphones every night while I'm asleep, and it has helped my bed-wetting problem over the years, in that I wet my bed much more now.  I've learned the meaning of life with this CD, it's much better than my old Color Me Badd CDs.
0224071262|1.0|With the release of Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's book `Mao, The Unknown Story', there has been no shortage of craven reviews, content, without a shred of substantiating evidence to accept the B-movie villain claims made within.  Fraudulent historians have always presented their new and outlandish allegations as being the result of having uncovered `shocking new evidence'.  However, having read Chang's previous book, `Wild Swans', the deliberate manipulation of facts and the misquoting of Chairman Mao himself suggests that the conclusions of this current book had been decided over a decade ago.   <br /> <br />This latest biography of Mao, co-written by the daughter of two allegedly corrupt officials (a common problem in post-revolutionary China), reads more as a hysterical rant by Chang against the man she blames for her family's downfall.  By Chang's own admission, during the Cultural Revolution that was inaugurated to root out \\"capitalist-roaders\\", her own brother was involved in the black market, her other brother being a criminal gang member.  Not surprisingly therefore, like herself, all her siblings she informs us, are currently doing well through their own capitalist enterprises.   <br /> <br />Although there are numerous outrageous charges, one of the more serious is that Mao was directly responsible for the deaths of around 70 million people, an apparently randomly generated estimate.  Most of these were apparently accrued during the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60.  Hostile western scholars have in the past, estimated that between 16.4 million and 29.5 million people died in the Great Leap, a common argument being that this was due to executions ordered by the Chinese Communist Party.  However, in more recent times it has become accepted that the deaths at this time were due to famine, natural disasters and starvation. Halliday/Chang however, attempt to attribute these starvation deaths to malicious programs and mismanagement of industrialisation and the distribution of goods.  As always, the first problem with such myths is that they are based on inaccurate statistics that compare projected population size with actual population size.  This method assumes constant population growth, which is far from reality during tumultuous periods in history such as revolution and population displacement.    <br /> <br />In reality, the deaths attributed to the Great Leap were mostly due to starvation in the Great Leap's aftermath (1960-1), when flooding and drought seriously affected over half of China's landmass.  The Soviet Union further aggravated this situation when it withdrew its technological aid in 1960, causing a virtual halt in most of China's industry. Thousands of Soviet technicians who were in China to assist with industrial development left within the period of a month, taking with them their blueprints and stopping supply shipments.    <br /> <br />Of course, there have been numerous anticommunist accounts of the life of Mao in the past.  None however, have had the gall to fabricate the outrageous claims made by Halliday/Chang, comparable as they are to recent claims concerning WMDs in Iraq.  Although Mao himself advised that, `we should seek truth from facts', Chang especially, with her all too obvious hatred of Mao, seems incapable of taking this advice.  Also one can only wonder at the timing of the release of Halliday/Chang's book, appearing as it does, at a time when Maoist rebels are coming close to seizing power in Nepal, control large parts of India and are once more gaining influence across South America.   <br /> <br />James Campbell, Dublin
1401301010|4.0|When I first checked this book out of the library, I was a little skeptical as to whether or not Anthony's life story could hold my attention during its 500+ pages. Well, surprisingly, it did.<br /><br />I think the I'm on drugs/now I'm in rehab gets a little redundant but what can you do, it's his life, it really happened. I found his crazy relationships very entertaining as well as the history of the band including intimate details. I'm glad I took the time out to read this because it was thoroughly enjoyed. I would give this 4.5 stars but, alas, I can not.
0765309408|4.0|I admit it, I bought the book because Amazon gave me a discount on deliver charges if I bought two, and I was already committed to another book (by Chales Stros). <br /> <br />As it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised by the development of amiable characters in the \\"Old Man's Wars\\" ... and what a great title that was! <br /> <br />Sure, there's a little of Heinlein's juvenile fiction efforts/accomplishments here.  I wouldn't compare it to \\"Time Enough For Love\\", because the breadth of \\"Time\\" just isn't here. <br /> <br />Certainly it's not \\"Starship Troopers\\", because the action scenes are as uniformly gripping ... but that may be closer. <br /> <br />John Ringo's books are a whole new generation, and those of us who have been reading him are reminded of his work ... but that's not quite the flavor. <br /> <br />I would be more inclined to compare the book to John Barnes, especially \\"Candle\\", one of Barnes' \\"Meme Wars\\" books.  Why? I can't tell you.  It's not a matter of substance; it's more a matter of style and the reader's impression. <br /> <br />The book was \\"a good read\\", and the characters were likeable.  Perhaps a little to shallow, in the sense that they were line-drawings rather than full portraits.  Perhaps that's a sign of a Good Writer, rather than that of an Excellent Writer. <br /> <br />It's probably unfair to compare the author to Heinlein, who could draw a character with a dozen words and make you remember that character for the rest of your life.    <br /> <br />John Perry is drawn as the sort of person you would instinctively like.  I had to go back to the book to refresh my memory, before I could quote is name.  It really doesn't seem important.  I read the book yesterday (in on sitting, which should give you some idea about its readability).  I'm certain that many of the scenes, such as the personal combat with the Consu and the unfortunate episode with the Slime Mold, will stay with me for a long time.  Perry is such an unassuming character,he's easy to forget against the backdrop of the action scenes. <br /> <br />Still, I do hope that Scalzi finds a similar theme and works it just a little bit harder. <br /> <br />In the meantime, \\"Old Man's War\\" will stay on my bookshelf.  I'll read it again the day I order his next book.
B00000AFFI|5.0|PJ Harvey has said that she tries to make every album distict from her previous ones.  While  this is debatable, she certainly succeeded with Is This Desire?  It is a mixture of eliptical, non narrative story songs, all song by characters who are not PJ Harvey, making it harder to find her than on her previous or subsequent albums.  The music and the lyrics here are bleak, partially because the songs are so contained.  It is also a mostly minimast use of sounds that are tremendously evocative.  It is worth repeated listenings.
0385338686|5.0|As an attorney that occasionally fantasizes about giving it all up and and embracing the \\"simpler\\" things in life, this book really spoke to me.  Sophie Kinsella's writing style and wit make all of her books fast-paced page turners and I love them all!  This book was certainly no exception.  Some might dismiss this book as being predictable, but you know what?  That's okay because you feel just plain good when you finish it and its a pleasant journey getting to the end.
B00004T9VY|5.0|This order was a gift. I have had the CD for years and like it so much I shared it with my niece. I would like more of the Cat.
1400031087|5.0|Update:<br /><br />Now that we know this guy's a big liar, I wouldn't recommend this at all.<br /><br />First review:James Frey's debut is really something special.  His writing is stark and simple, yet completely descriptive and powerful.  I really could not put this book down and recommend it completely.<br /><br />This was an absolute bonus.  I purchased this book (and his second, My Friend Leonard) after seeing Frey on John Stossel's Addiction program.  Frey stood by his belief that addicts make a choice to drink.  Yes, it's a compulsion, maybe, and there may very well be a physical component. However, he believes that he and only he is responsible for his addiction. Not a higher power.  And, I admire this about him and immediately ordered his book.<br /><br />Because he survives, it is easy to see much of what he goes through at the treatment center with a bit of dark  humor.  He, too, sees the lunacy in his situation and with the people he meets. Although he mentions a few of the less colorful characters, he really hangs around the hardcore addicts.  And, seeing what happens to all of these folks at the end is more than a little heartbreaking.<br /><br />I've been reading a lot of addiction memoirs recently, and this is one of the best.  If you're thinking of purchasing this, get his follow-up memoir, too, My Friend Leonard.

B0002KPIQY|5.0|This movie was really good. I cannot believe how much Angelina looks like Gia. SHe did an awesome job capturing Gia's image and personality. This was a graphic movie but it really showed the emotion behind all the pain and sucess of Gia's life.
B00004RF9B|5.0|A classic that I've enjoyed from my youth. It is great to see <br />it again and to share with friends.
B000003TA9|5.0|I bought the CD for the first time after getting used to liking their other CD \\"Experimental Jet Set, Trash, And No Star\\" and I was in for a huge surprise.  The songs were easier to listen to and I enjoyed their hard thrash alternative and their signature screeching guiters.  The best songs to listen to are \\"Wish Fulfillment\\", \\"Sugar Kane\\", and \\"In The Strip\\".  Definitely worth a listen to.
068987474X|5.0|This is a great read for the single girl who's had her share of the shifty guys.  We all know better than this, but this just kind of reminds us how much we should value ourselves.  Very funny,entertaining, I'm reccomending to all my friends.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Brando brilliance. Pacino perfection and the un-deniable de Niro. Coppola's directorial vision and production of Mario Puzo's the Godfather leaves you with you with all your emotions entangled. Love, hate, honor, respect, sadness, happines and fear is all part of this great 3-part epic. The life of a three generation Mafia family binds you from the opening line till the gripping ending of part three. There has not since been another Cosa Nostra epic of these proportions. A fouth DVD gives you a very indepth look at the making of the Godfather. Interviews, production sets and much more gives you a pretty good idea of the brilliance of Coppola. Enjoy.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving pictures is one of the finest progressive rock albums from this legendary rock band from canada and is one of their best.this terrific album contains masterpieces like Tom Sawyer,YYZ and Vital signs.hugely recommended along with fly by night.

0060922583|5.0|I felt the book was extremely intresting, not only because of how it explained quantum physics or a new understanding of brain and body but also on paranormal phenomena (a personel curiosity of mine) I would recommend this book to anyone intrested in the nature of reality.
B000002ADT|5.0|An album that must be on anyone's desert island list.  If you could only take one, it's between this and Beethoven's Ninth.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|As Fox normally does with great shows, this series was cancelled after just a couple of shows.  This series has already become a cult classic and this box set is great for anyone who enjoys this sci-fi classic.  The set isn't cluttered with large boxes and doesn't take up half my shelf.  The show itself is just plain out fun with a fantastic cast.   <br />The show isn't about a totally optimistic future where everything turns out great.  Instead the show tries to stick closer to what the future may very likely be.  Add to this the humor and action everyone can appreciate and you've got a great show.
B0008KLW7W|4.0|A lot of people, my mother and brother included, did not like this movie as much as the first two because it deviates from the books a bit. But let's be realistic, the director is never going to be able to cram all of the book into a movie.<br /><br />It's good, but the book is still better...
B00008976Y|3.0|Slow paced bordering on boredom. Events are almost predictable (apart from the sexual choices of the heroine..!). I prefer Red over Blue.
B00005UOXN|5.0|If you want the best output done by Billy Idol-this is the album for you.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I was first introduced to A7X through their music video for Unholy Confessions, which I thought ROCKED. I bought this cd and I must tell you, if you want to listen to real music, buy this cd. <br /> <br />It seems that lately in today's world, a lot of popular music (rap) is just a beat repeated for 3 minutes with someone singing about partying. I miss the days of Van Halen, Metallica, Kiss, Motley Crue, etc etc etc when it was REAL MUSIC and REAL EMOTIONS. <br /> <br />City of Evil brings that all back to me, with many guitar rifts and lots of emotion. I have never bought a cd with so many guitar solos in my life. That's why most of the songs are 5+ minutes, with the shortest one \\"Burn it Down\\" being 4:58 which is still close enough :P. <br /> <br />The songs in this cd are generally pure metal, with a few accoustics thrown in and the occasional western theme, or other theme to break it and spice it up. I know it sounds kinda strange, but it is performed in such a way that you'll still love it. <br /> <br />Burn It Down, Bat Country, and Strength of the World are my three favorites. <br /> <br />If you want to listen to some real music, buy this cd. Otherwise, go party in your club. Highly recomended, buy it ASAP.
B0009AM5JA|1.0|This album is a piece of crap...I don't see how anybody could give this five stars unless they're are just as empty and devoid as this cd. I happen to like Coldplay's last two albums but the music sounds as formulaic as the album title. I thought that Coldplay would try to branch into a new sound that could inspire me more than their more deliberate commercial release of Rush of Blood to the Head but X&amp;Y is as lively as a rotting animal curled up by the side of the highway.
B00000DHRX|4.0|The only song missing was the original I WANT YOUR SEX.Good listening CD.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This cd is fabulous.  I was never a fan of big band or the Frank Sinatra era.  I purchased this cd after hearing \\"Home\\" playing on every radio station.  I didn't know what to expect.  I had not heard of Michael Buble before then.  His cd blew me away.  I can't get enough of it.  I got the opportunity to see him last week while in New Orleans.  WOW!!!  This kid is spectacular in concert.  He has so much personality and some great moves.  If you get the opportunity, go to his concert.  It's worth whatever you pay for it.  I'm looking forward to see what he does next.
0684859106|2.0|I must agree with others who found that the recipes simply do not work. I have been baking for over 30 years and have had great success with other cookbooks, but the recipes I have tried in this book are *complete disasters*.  The cakes and cupcakes come out flat and dry.  The icing recipes are very sweet and make very large amounts.  I would caution cooks too not use these recipes for special occassions, bake sales, etc. unless you have first tried the recipes so you can make adjustments.  In all fairness, it seems to be a problem caused by adjusting recipes to smaller batches coupled with insufficient testing.  My supermarket flour and home oven have worked fine with baking recipes from many other chefs.
B0000256VK|5.0|There are two schools of thought on the eighties. The first camp tends to think that the eighties was a complete musical wasteland. The second camp, usually more musically astute, were the lucky recepients of some masterpieces of rock. Avalon and Roxy Music are both testament to the kind of stellar production we got out the eighties. Avalon is simply a lush album. The production is pristine would be in excess for any other band. But Bryan Ferry's voice and Phil Manzanera's guitar work demand this kind of polish. The musicianship and the songs are first rate. It's a departure from the wierd campy-ness that you get from the earlier albums. It's the more accessible sound that made this album so huge.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is so much smarter than most shows on TV today or in the last few years. I just don't understand why it was cancelled. It's a wonderful show and this DVD boxset is more than worth buying. The show is addictive.
B0009XNUK0|3.0|This album is a cruel trick in it's title. This is NOT an essential album to add to your Michael Jackson collection. While this one does fill in most of the gaps the other greatest hits collections have missed (especially \\"Human Nature\\"), people who already have his albums or one of his other three greatest hits compilations (\\"Number Ones\\", \\"Ultimate\\", or \\"HIStory\\") will find this disc redundant. Do yourself a favor: If you are starting a MJ collection, begin it by getting \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\", easily his two best albums. After those two, then pick up \\"Bad\\" and then this one up to fill in the gaps of the other albums he has released.
B000002UAU|5.0|If you grew up in the 60's you had to have this in your album collection. This was a defining work by probably the most talented and experimental group of it's time. Truly a classic from beginning to end. All four Beatles contributed songs that would become classics by their fans. This rates right up there with The Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\". If you don't have this, get it.
B000089RVX|4.0|well, i was pretty surprised with some of the reviews out there. it IS one of the better albums in the pop-rock market. let's start naming tracks.    Going Under- well, i wish it was less edited, but besides that, it's pretty good. i watched the Yahoo exclusive music vid, and she does have trouble getting that E...well, it is low, i'll give her that. 8/10    Bring Me to Life- well, if she hadn't said that they weren't a Christian band, this and Tourniquet would have been the reasons why i would think they would be.  it is really well sung, but i wish that wind hadn't come when she sang her first note. 9/10    Everybody's Fool- the music vid is so sad...she sings so well, it makes it even better...*without the mask, where will you hide?* 9.5/10    My Immortal- i liked the band version better, but coordinating the piano and the vocals must have been very challenging. i was amazed at how well she controlled her voice while playing piano. 8/10 for this version, 9/10 for the other    Haunted- i scare easily, this really freaks me out, and i wish she wouldn't have used \\"rape\\" in the song. well, always the halloween choice. very aptly named. 7/10    Tourniquet- it says \\"the pain\\", but it sounds like \\"our pain\\"...(...)    Imaginary- i don't get the song at all. the lyrics are like she's daydreaming or something...the only song that i think is worse is Haunted. 7.5    Taking Over Me- this really caught me with the lyrics: they're really strong. 9/10    Hello- after auditioning for the talent show with this, and after finding who it was dedicated for, it became even better... 9.5/10    My Last Breath- strong lyrics like Taking Over Me, with a dash of haunt...9/10    Whisper- my fave song in the entire album, it helps conquer fear anyplace if you start to think of the chorus. 10/10    avg. of 8.6/10...
B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" is a sequel to the simple love story \\"Before Sunrise.\\" This time, Jesse and Celine only have an hour and a half in which to get reacquainted, catch up, and go from there. The film is set on a gorgeous afternoon in Paris where golden light spills onto every rooftop and alleyway. Like the light, this film has a transitory brilliance that must be taken in slowly, gently, to appreciate all the different nuances and layers taken to create it. What makes this film work so amazingly is its simplicity; these characters walk around, discuss everything from world politics to the meaning of life, and realize how important they are to eachother. From that is borne the film's main strength- we care so much about these people that their pending seperation creates an overwhelming amount of tension, making the film consistently entertaining and a joy to watch. There is also a well-executed sense of melancholy with Jese and Celine, apparent through great acting and writing. They meet, get coffee, talk, wander around, and all the while chance and fate continue to work, until the ending arrives on a note of beauty and complete grace. A deeply good film.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This movie is a classic. It is one of the best sci-fi movies from the 1950's. Besides Walter Pidgeon - you will see many recognizable faces in the cast (if you are 40 years or older). <br />It won awards for special effects and it introduces \\"Robby the Robot\\". A \\"remake\\" of Shakespeare's Tempest - it is a great movie.

B00005JNZ4|5.0|Diane Lane plays a believable 40 yr old pre-school teacher, Sarah Nolan, who recently got divorced. She is receiving all kinds of help and suggestions for finding a date from her two sisters, three brothers, widower dad, and even an elderly Aunt. Sarah resists all of their efforts until Sarah's sister  completes an Internet Dating service questionairre on her behalf. She describes Sarah as \\"voluptuous\\" and also adds the sentence \\"must love dogs\\". The only photo she has of Sarah is her graduation pic which she places on the site. In the meantime, Sarah is also introduced to the dad of one of her students who is handsome, Italian-looking, and with whom Sarah exchanges compliments. There is obvious chemistry between them but Sarah made a vow which she intends to keep to never to date one of her student's dads. Yet, she develops a crush on him. The real comedy starts when Sarah answers one of the 18 voice messages she receives on the computer dating service. She agrees to meet with Jake, played by John Cusack. They meet at a park for walking dogs, each of them had \\"borrowed\\" a dog for the occasion. The lines they exchange as they check each other out are hilarious ... Their first date to an ethnic Armenian restaurant is fabulous and so realistic. The conversation between them is great and memorable. Other amusing moments in the film are when Jake and his lawyer friend are watching \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" at home, discussing its merits related to modern dating. Just the fact of two guys viewing Doctor Zhivago ... when neither of them has a date is amusing and their rating it as the ideal romantic film is highly ironic.<br /><br />This film is laughing out loud funny as it mimics real world ironies on many levels for adult dating, whether divorced, single, or widowers, the film works for them all. Many experiences between Sarah and Jake parody real-life and are hugely funny. Sarah and Jake stop seeing each other due to a misunderstanding where a love triangle develops, involving Bob, the pre-school pupil's dad. After breaking up with Jake, Sarah answers many internet dates, each one is worse than the next. Sarah eventually sleeps with Bob but under false pretext ... which she eventually realizes and drops Bob, accusing him of having \\"used her\\" when she was vulnerable. He acts innocent of all charges hurled verbally at him. Sarah's dad inadvertantly meets Jake outside a coffee shop as Jake is taking his hand-made row boat out for the last time .. before it is sold to be mounted on a wall. Jake shares some of his sentiments of lost love with Sarah's dad - not knowing who he really is. Sarah's dad quotes Jake to her and Sarah then realizes whom her dad had met ... She awakens to the fact Jake truly cares for her and she pursues him. The film is completely satisfying on all levels. It has technical merit, great comedy because it mimics real life so well. The actors and actresses are all perfect for their respective roles. Although this film is comparable to many \\"formula\\" films of \\"boy meets girl\\", \\"they fall in love\\", and \\"they live happily ever after\\", the most important aspects of this film are its modern twists and unique differences, making it a summer favorite worth discovering for oneself.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)Bob, the pre-school pupil's dad.

B000003TA4|3.0|Kurt Cobain, a guy who listened to his Vaselines and Wipers records and his Black Flag and Melvins records and decided he wanted melody and anger and speed and ferocity. Of course, there's nothing strange about this. Many people want to do things like this. And, just like Lou Reed could apply Burroughs lyrics to Ornette Coleman backing, Cobain was lucky enough to be able to combine his influences. So what he did was write some pop songs with a bleaker lyrical outlook on life and a meaner musical backing. Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic were there to give his songs above-average rock instrumentation.  <br />          Nevermind was the first bubblegum/hardcore fusion and it worked in the bands favour. Smells Like Teen Spirit is a hit. The work is done. Marry a rock-star wife, take up junk, blast yourself, become immortalised in rock history. God Bless Cobains family, it's a tragedy he got so caught up in success. When thinking about these things, it's a good idea to listen to The Smiths song 'Paint A Vulgar Picture'... gee I've lost my point.... NEXT PARAGRAPH. <br />           So Q Magazine readers voted this The Greatest Album Of All Time back in January 2003. Balderdash. Pure and utter balderdash. Cobain had a decent melody or two, but he was no poet. The lyrics are but shallow, meaningless couplts knocked off so he'd have something to sing that sounded 'depthful' and 'artistic'. In reality they're random words that sound good together. I think, deep down, Cobain may have been lying when he wrote 'I'd rather be dead than cool' in 'Stay Away'. If you want a top-class Cobain work, richer lyrically and musically, get In Utero. Nevermind is a stepping stone. A man of great talent on the road to artistic maturity. There was something in the way alright, but soon he blew it out of his way and went on to write accomplished works like 'Scentless Apprentice', 'Very Ape' and 'Serve The Servants'.  <br />           I am not, I repeat, not saying Nevermind is a bad album. It's an above-average early nineties classic. It's better than most in its league. It beats a lot of its derivatives, though Nirvana came nowhere near The Wipers in terms of pure mastery of craft. Greg Sage was the man behind the genius of The Wipers and if you want great pop-punk buy the first three Wipers albums, three complete masterpieces, available in one box-set. So, if you don't own Nevermind, buy it, forget about the myth and just enjoy it's simplicity and pop-appeal. Eventually you'll get tired of it, then you can buy In Utero, which you won't ever tire of, if you're like me. Overall, Nevermind makes quite a soundtrack to adolescence. I don't listen to bands like Nirvana much nowadays, but they were very important, so respect them for now, and you may soon love them.
B000819PKC|5.0|This is by far the best album Jamiroquai has produced since synkronized.(Not saying that the others sucked but they were good too!) I am a Jamiroquai fan and this album lives up too discoesque-funky feel good groove sound that you would come to expect from Jay Kay. Do you your ears a favor and get this cd. They will thank you for it!
0060594888|5.0|I have been a student of personal development for over 30 years. This book is the best overall that I have ever read and studied on the subject.<br /><br />Jack Canfield has really hit a home run in my opinion. Every aspect of personal development and improvement is focused on in depth.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This was by far the best present my son got for his 9th birthday.  He is enjoying in temendously.  He watches at least one of these movies a day with his little brother.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|My friend described this as Queen meets Radiohead, which peaked my interest.  Little did I know that this would be one of my favorite CD's ever.  Get it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I believe this concert by the King of Pop is simply his greatest, an unmatched performance by MJ that no other artist could even come closer... <br /> <br />The songs performed are a perfect choice, each song is a story; very interesting & magical, the concert is full of fireworks, stunning magics, terrific effects, and i believe Michael Jackson is the greatest dancer the world has ever witnessed! <br /> <br />I still can't believe how he performed these songs on stage that way they were done!  <br /> <br />A must a have DVD for all music lovers, the DVD is worth every penny, its 2 hours long, the quality is great!
0064430170|5.0|We have loved this book so much over the past 5 years that we had to buy a new copy :)
6305320802|3.0|I have always loved the soundtrack to \\"Oklahoma\\".  These are delightful and memorable songs ... and I don't think there's a bad one among them.  They tell the story ... as perhaps a good musical soundtrack should ... and a person who has never seen the movie or play could get a fairly good picture of the story by listening to them.<br /><br />The movie's quality is not, however, as thoroughly good as its music.  I wonder who made the decisions for this picture ... as there are some pretty big flubs and a distinct lack of understanding of what makes good entertainment.<br /><br />The bright spots include ... \\"Everything's Up To Date in Kansas City\\".  Gene Nelson, as Will, may actually be the best entertainer in the picture, and his talents are showcased in this number.  \\"Poor Jud is Dead\\" hits the bull's eye in matching a song to the particular action in a scene ... and we get to laugh at the movie's bad guy.  \\"The Farmer and the Cow Man Should be Friends\\" is a fun number, \\"All or Nothing\\" is carried off nicely, and \\"Oklahoma\\" is an excellent and uplifting song to end the movie with.<br /><br />The performances vary.  Gordon MacRae had one of the purest most enjoyable singing voices I have ever heard, but here, as Curly, he is not a great actor ... though he does get the job done.  Shirley Jones, as Laurey, is OK ... she does all right ... for a rookie.  Gloria Grahame, as Ado Annie, was a good choice for the part ... a bit old perhaps ... but definately a good fit.  She's a little tight early on in the movie (for some reason) ... but then she loosens up nicely and does her best work.  Rod Steiger is Jud Fry, and he is scary here ... a good performance ... maybe the best in the picture ... but very unsettling.  Eddie Albert is solid (as he was in all his TV and motion picture appearances) as Ali Hakim the Persian peddler.  And James Whitmore does a nice turn or two as Andrew (Ado Annie's pa).<br /><br />Now for the criticisms.  The movie makers' failings can perhaps be best summed up in three words ... The Dream Sequence.  The Dream Sequence occurs when Laurey daydreams about marrying Curly ... and it is not pretty.<br /><br />The film's choreography is up and down.  When they stick to dance steps that are Western in style ... all goes well.  But often they use classic ballet movements ... and it just doesn't fit.<br /><br />A couple of scenes are hard to figure.  Prior to the big \\"Box Dance\\" everybody rides over to Aunt Eller's house.  OK so far.  Then all the women go inside and ... disrobe.  Laurey sings \\"Many a New Day\\" and we get more ballet.  (Did they do that in Oklahoma when it was just a territory?)  Then everybody goes outside and ... picks peaches.<br /><br />The Jud Fry character is allowed to be pretty evil ... sometimes incredibly so ... and I question the entertainment wisdom of doing this.  The two instances that stand out (for me anyway) are ... riding to the box dance, Laurey arrives late and alone and upset (she had begun the ride with Jud).  Curly knows she's with Jud and he knows she is late, but he does nothing about it when she finally shows up.  Later, at the dance, Jud accosts Laurey, and Curly, who was nearby just a minute ago, again does nothing.  I just think there were some serious lapses of judgement on the part of the movie makers.<br /><br />So, we get all those great songs, but they are wrapped in paper that is sometimes pretty, sometimes unusual, and sometimes ugly.  \\"Oklahoma\\" could have ... should have ... been better.... The Dream Sequence.  The Dream Sequence occurs when Laurey daydreams about marrying Curly ... and it is not pretty.    The film's choreography is up and down.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|These women have the sweetest, most lyrical voices that I have heard just about anywhere.  The music is exciting and soothing and often exotic.
B00005JNTX|1.0|This is only the second movie in my life that I have walked out of (the first was Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls, which bored me to death).  I have to admit that the creation of the comic book atmosphere is well done, and the acting isn't bad within the requirements of the plot.  What turned me off was the over-the-top non-stop sadistic violence, and the total lack of any character that one could empathise with.  The film works startlingly well at creating its sick dirty world.  It just isn't a world that I think any mentally healthy person would want to spend time in.    PS Judging by the percentage of people rating this review as unhelpful, I guess only fans of the film are reading this review!  Well, it's your mind...
B0006L16N8|3.0|<br />Great Lyrics; <br /> <br />Nice to listen in the car while traveling down the NJ Turnpike. <br />Soothes the soul. I had not listened to this popular group before <br />but I am glad that I did. Definitely a Coldplay fan.. <br /> <br />Jeffrey
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton's book is a must read for anybody who is serious about their health.  His ground breaking work needs to have text books re-written.  If everyone had the knowledge he shares in his book, then we would all treat ourselves, each other and the world much better than we do. If you haven't read it yet, then now is the time.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I did not see this movie when it came out in theaters, because like so many \\"Phantom\\" stage fans, I figured it would be a disappointment.  My only disappointment, having seen Phantom on DVD about 25 times now, is that I didn't get to see Gerard Butler play the Phantom on the big screen.  For those who criticize the film for being \\"too different\\" than the play, I say this:  IT IS DIFFERENT!  It's a film! And while Phantom was always my #1 favorite play (until I saw Wicked last year), I love the film 10 times more.  Gerard Butler was SO PHENOMENAL as the Phantom that I had to immediately look up his bio, as I had never heard of this actor.  I am now his biggest fan. His voice is incredible, both melodic and manly, mysterious and realistic at the same time.  The chemistry between Gerard and Emmy Rossum (whose performance is beyond words)is so powerful that you can feel the heat coming off the screen.  It is by far the BEST romantic pair casting I have seen in years.  No one shows more than a bit of bare shoulder or a bit of bare chest, and there is hardly any physical contact, but Gerard and Emmy nevertheless drink each other in and leave you yearning for just a taste.  I read one review that said that Gerard had the unfortunate job of being \\"the guy who isn't Michael Crawford.\\"  Are you insane?  I would say that Crawford has the unfortunate job of being \\"the guy that Gerard Butler buried.\\"  Other critics say Gerard's Phantom is too young and sexy - these critics must be jealous old guys.  The Phantom should be young, forget what the book says - an older Phantom in love with the teenage Christine is just creepy.  As for sexy, THANK YOU Mr. Schumacher for finally giving us such a sexy Phantom that you don't even mind the disfigured face - I'd still kiss him without flinching!  Gerard's innate sensuality is evident in the way he uses every part of his body to display his passion for Christine: the way his cheeks tremble with sadness made my heart break for him and movedme to tears several times;  the way he glides, hips first in an almost cocky swagger yet possessed with regal confidence and pure carnal machoism - will make every woman want him and every man jealous of him.  I could go on and on about the gorgeous cinematography, the costumes, the scenery, etc., but just GO SEE THIS MOVIE.  <br />
0975991477|5.0|I never thought I'd enjoy reading what could be classified as a biology lecture as much as I enjoyed reading this! Not only did I learn a LOT about cell biology, but Lipton does a great job translating the lessons of biology to everyday life and how we can use those lessons to live happier, more successful, more harmonious lives. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone seeking to live a happier, richer, more productive life.

078322933X|3.0|I'm on the fence with this one.  It's certainly watchable but ultimately it's exploitation crap posing as an important cautionary tale.  The film starts off promising enough with the nubile but virginal Nicole(Reese Witherspoon) falling for brooding grunge boy David(Mark Wahlberg) starting with whispering sweet nothings to more intimate contact on a rollercoaster.  Daddy Steve(William Petersen) objects to David but can't exactly put his finger on it.  Maybe it's the fact that David pummeled Gary, Nicole's platonic friend, and blackened Nicole's eyes in the process.  Whatever subtlety there was in the film is thrown out the window with an extended siege by David and his grunge buddies of Nicole's house that plays like a junior version of \\"Cape Fear\\".  It's a shame because this film has a pretty good pedigree with it's cast and director James Foley(\\"At Close Range\\", \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\") at the helm.  The film can be recommended for some pretty good performances by Witherspoon and Wahlberg.  Just be forewarned that this is thriller-lite.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|My cousin and I were in blockbuster the other night looking for  movies and we happened upon Crybaby. We both had seen it a long time ago, and noticed that Johnny Depp was in it, so we decided to give it a chance. <br />   What we did not anticipate was the endless laughter and joy we found while watching this movie. The satirical element of it is hilarious, and the music is amazing! We found ourselves walking around quoting the movie, and showing it to all of our friends. The cast is perfect for their roles, and the plot is so far fetched that it all fits together. <br />  Some of the lines from the movie are similar to those of Napoleon Dynamite....so hilarious you can't believe it just happened....and then you find yourself quoting it all the time.!   <br />  Crybaby is one of my favorite movies now, and I think you should all see it.... <br />
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Dreary action thriller that would like you to believe that its about something when it's really about nothing. Keanu Reeves gives another one of his great wooden performance as a supernatural detective who helps a cop (Rachel Weisz) try to solve apparent suicide of her twin sister unknowing of the dark forces that are at work. Safe to say that Keanu is ready to save the world again but when he does it, you don't believe a single thing he does because you don't believe him in the role. The movie would have been better served if they got an actor who would have played the role a bit more maturely and with a bit more feeling but Reeves just seem more like a cry baby than a man who know what he is doing and he just does not come across well in the role. The script unfortunately adds fuel to the fire with its unfocused story and lousy lines of dialog, which is literally over juvenile for a movie that has such dark themes.  The direction also adds nothing in terms of helping the movie out of its dilemma with way too many unfocused shots and too many unnecessary scenes that adds nothing to the movie at all. <br /> <br />There is some good in this movie and it comes from Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie's only stellar performance. She's so good that you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen while you know deep down that the movie is not as good as her performance.  Another good performance comes from Peter Stormare who is criminally underused in a bit part as the devil himself. His performance is ten times more potent than the lousy performance of Keanu Reeves as the lead and he's only in the film for about five minutes. <br /> <br />I don't know exactly what went wrong with this film but if the producers of the movie wanted to make a better film, they just could have cut Keanu out all together and just focus on the great performance of Weisz and Stormare. Add a director who knows what he is doing and a script that makes sense and you have a greatmovie there. This movie unfortunately is not very good and you can thank Keanu and the director for that.  <br />
0345440900|1.0|After having read all of the great reviews for this book, my husband and I purchased it a little before giving birth to our first child.  Although Tracy Hogg's method probably worked for a lot of people, it definitely did not work for our family. I serously regret having followed her advice despite what my mothering instincts told me. For countless days and nights my husband and I needlessly let our infant daughter cry because of what Ms. Hogg had advocated. We had so much hope that if we just followed her methods our baby would fall into the E.A.S.Y. routine. Not only did this never happen but our daughter (who is now two) grew to be distant and untrusting of her parents because we didn't respond to her needs. Some people would say that this isn't necessarily because of the E.A.S.Y routine, but from my personal experience, I honestly believe that my parenting abilities improved the minute I stopped following Ms. Hogg's advice. In retrospect, I now see the E.A.S.Y. method as another way of advocating for babies to 'cry it out'. Not only is this dangerous to their health (because of dehydration and stress) but it is also dangerous to the parent & child relationship. Secrets of the Baby Whisperer told me to not trust my own instincts and to disregard what my baby had to say. With all of the knowledge that I now have as a second time parent, I would recommend any of the Dr. Sears books. Good luck to you on your parenting journey!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|SPOILERS!!! l finally saw this excellent movie, both versions - the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Release. l also read all the bickering about which ending is better, and as far as l'm concerned, either one will do. Why? For the very simple reason that Evan did NOT do any time-traveling whatsoever except in his own twisted mind, being a patient in a Psychiatric Facility!  <br /> <br />The key to the movie is the Psychiatrist's absolutely stunning revelation to Evan that there are NO notebooks, that he used these in his imagination in order to create Alternate Universes. Why? So as to escape the guilt of having been the instrument of killing his neighbor's young daughter for whom he had a puppy-love crush. l repeat: there were NO notebooks! Thus - no time travel except in his twisted mind! Evan is a certified crackpot, folks.  <br /> <br />As for the endings, 6 of one, half a dozen of the other: Director's Cut - he escapes either by killing himself (in another Alternate Universe)at birth and, it has to be assumed, fully withdrawing into himself for the rest of his life in the Sanitarium; or - Theatrical Release - as a youngster, he detaches himself fully from the young girl and her family, and everyone goes on to lead their own lives - no dynamite, no beatings, no killings, no prostitution, etc. Either way, nothing happens to Evan and his 3 friends.
B00005JNSK|2.0|Not a family film in anyway.  This film is just weird, scary and not really entertaining.  Why film makers of now-a-days think that they can outdo something as wonderful as the original production is way beyond me.  I was not impressed, if anything the film was extremely distorting.  I should have realized that Tim Burton does not have a grip on reality anyway.  Hollywood gets more weird each day and i believe that i will be staying away from Hollywood/american entertainment of film making.  No wonder less and less people are viewing american films.  It seems that whatever is produced in Hollywood should stay in Hollywood.  It would be a blessing if someday the state of California just breaks off and falls into the ocean.
0446677450|5.0|Truly one of the best books I've read for bringing big thinking ideas to the masses.  Anyone, at any level, can benefit from the insights brought forward in Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
B0000025T6|5.0|Unlike everyone else on the planet, I am not a huge Springsteen fan. That being said I love this album.  So full of soul, it even rivals Van Morrison's Astral Weeks as one of the top soulfull albums ever. You also know you have done something right when Johnny Cash covers your song, as he did from one of Springsteen's songs here. <br />Enjoy.
1881273156|5.0|Upon the recommendation of several friends, I bought this book. Although I have been married for 5 years, this book was very helpful for us. It helped us understand each other's point of view (\\"love language\\"), rather than assigning ours to one another. The short quizzes in the back were very helpful.
0385513755|5.0|This book was kept proped open in my desk drawer so that I didn't have to stop reading it at work.  No matter what your beliefs are this is an amazing read full history, fiction, mystery, adventure, and hope.  This is a sparkling diamonds amonge dime store trinkets.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|How I waited for a new SOAD album, and I was not disappointed. I don't believe it is a 5 star one, but not being able to vote 4.5 stars means I must err on the side of caution. <br />Where to start??? Well BYOB, Revenga, Violent Pornography and Cigaro are all instant classics, Revenga for it's sheer theatrics. <br />One thing I will say - give it several listens before giving it a thumbs up or thumbs down. It really does grow on you. <br />The album does seem to end with a whimper, perhaps it is a lead in to Hypnotise. <br />If you are not a fan I would start with Toxicity and Steal this Album (or Toxicity part 2 as it could also be called), rather than going backwards. <br />
0156027321|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The ingenuity Pi used in tricking a tiger amazed me.  A must read.  I have recommended this book to many.
0393039765|5.0|Unbelievable book.  I've seen the movie about 45 times then found out it was a book!  And like usual, the book was better.  There is such force and direction behind the writing.  The ideas that this book contains are simply genius.  Everything comes together for one reason or another.  It's a mind bending, mind enhancing, mind opening book that will, in one way or another, change the way you view things.  Definitely worth buying because you will read it over and over again.  The story is original and Chuck Palahniuk delivers one punch after another.
1400032717|5.0|What a wonderful book.  I work in a school with Autistic children, but do not work close enough with them to understand their world.  This was an amazing book.  I read it in a matter of hours.  Not only did the author portray their perceptance of normal events (not including the impaled dog), but he allowed one to contemplate the outcome without the outcome being obvious.
B000069AUI|4.0|I wasn't sold on this band at first. The singles were nice but I felt they lacked depth. But the wistful quality of Martin's voice, coupled with the simple piano found on \\"The Scientist\\" finally pulled me in.I finally broke down and bought this one because I realized I really liked this sound. The songs are melodic and have a real texture to them; there are layers to the sound that reward repeated listening. While lyrically the concepts are very basic and presented that way; it works very well in this setting. They are just a very likeable band.
140003180X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. It is well-written and very wholesome.  I have read some of the other books in this series and feel very at home with the characters. I look forward to being with them again in the Full Cupboard of Life.
1558908382|5.0|I love this dark comedy, it reminds me that high school reunions should be attended at your own risk.  Martin Blank is a professional hit man, who goes to his ten year high school reunion.    There he discovers that old flames can be rekindled, old friendships can be found again, and that time changes everyone. The fact that he is being shadowed by several other hit men intent on killing him, just adds to the fun of the event. Seeing this you might discover that your high school reunion could never be as interesting.
B00006RCSR|5.0|This moive is one movie that I will always have in my collection. The charming Drew Barrymore and the most handsome Dougray Scott make for a perfect couple. My granddaughter loves this movie very much. She says that this must have been the real story because it's nothing like a Disney movie. Don't worry.. I try to tell her it's the same story told in a different way.. yet she protest.. in wishful thinking that Gaberilla is real.<br /><br />I think that the Book the character's father brings her to read moves her to be who she is, which is a gripping person who you'd like to know. Dougray is so enchanting that you'll want to find other movies he is in.. which I think this one is his best! I only own two of his movies. I don't know how many he actually made. I love both Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott in this movie!<br /><br />The character of the Fairy God Mother is a great surprise.. and an artist who sees the beauty in Cinderella and portays it not only in what he has to say to the prince about her.. but what he paints. I would recommend this story to anyone of any age. It has a few gems in it that you will want to look into once you see the movie. It's more then charming and enchanting.. it's positively everything that romance and love should say. You will wish that you could find them in a follow-up movie.. \\"Where are they now\\" type thing. I would love to see them in another movie together!<br /><br />Buy it.. it won't regret it!
B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie was full of great special effects and just plain breathtaking disasters that make you stop and think: is there really something to all those warnings those global warming scientists have been yapping about?  While the plot is a little too far-fetched for reality, it's a touching story in the end.  \\"Twister\\" on steroids is how I might sum it up.  I would recommend this movie for anyone in the mood for cool special effects.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie wasn't bad at all it just doesn't have the classic original Star Wars feel to it!!! It was entertaining though especially Jar Jar Binks. The movie gives you an idea about how life was before the rise of the Empire. It shows how the Republic has grown corrupt and reveals the return of the sith, and the begging of the end. <br /> <br /> Once you see episode 2 and 3 you'll see the whole cycle and see how it becomes a story. This movie shows Dart Vader/ Anakin Skywalker as a little boy and from the very begging he shows how powerful he is by: winning the intense pod race(great part in the movie) and being a major factor in the battle of Naboo!!! <br /> <br /> This movie widens the universe of Star Wars and shows the difference between 1977 from 1999.Episode 1 features some awesome computer generated material, and visual beauty. This movie also gives you the origns of characters: like Darth Siduios/The Emperor, Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, R2D2, and C3PO!!! The movie gives you the basic idea of how the Star Wars universe is and what it will become!!! It was indeed important to release this movie!!! <br /> <br /> The movie starts off when the droid armies of The Trade Federation/big players in episode 2 and 3/ threathen to invade Naboo!!! Jedi Knight Qui Gon Jin and his padwan Obi Wan Kenobi go to force a negation, as you imangine things don't go as planed!!!  <br /> <br /> From their the movie takes off in a mix of action adventure and some comedy. Anyways, they manage to make their way on Naboo and help queen Amidala escape and break through the blockade, thanks to R2d2 of course!!! They must then land on Tatoonie for repairs: Qui Gon Jin, Jar Jar Binks, and Padme (the real queen) set out and meet Anakin and C3po, imangine the thearpy sessions if C3po ever found out that Darth Vader was his father, that would be some great material to film... huh,    *cough*  <br /> <br /> Anyways, Anakin shows signs in the force from the very begging, with the pod race, and has the highest midiclorian account in the history!!! He then comes with Qui Gon Jin , then their is the first encounter by the mysterious Darth Maul!!! Well... you get the point this movie tells you about the history of Star Wars at the beggining. I do think they could have made the movie better, though!!! <br /> <br /> Overall, to understand the full saga of Star Wars this is a must have and it's also a great action packed movie, so it is a win, win senario!!! I give this movie a 3.5/5!!! This is a great film but, is over shadowed by the rest of the saga!!!  <br />  <br /> In my opinion, they focused too much on the special effects and story, which led to the movie's downfall!!! <br />
B00009NHC5|5.0|This movie is a captivating thriller that I enjoy watching over and over again.  You see a different side of Audrey in this film.  I was thrilled to add it to my DVD library.  An all around great movie.
B00003CXA6|4.0|Turner production. well made awd fairly accurate. Good acting and good direction.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have always loved the Eagles' music and this tops everything.  They get better with time and they have such a great backup orchestra.  They sing all their best songs plus some wonderful new ones - one of the best being\\"There's a Hole in the World Tonight\\" in tribute to Sept. 11th.  It will get you \\"right here\\". <br />You can't go wrong with this DVD.  I have already bought 2 and will probably get more for birthdays coming up. <br />Jan C. <br />Scottsdale, AZ
0345451325|2.0|*Sigh*, where to begin?  *Possible Spoilers* <br /> <br />First, and foremost, this novel is rife with editing errors.  As a journalism student, I picked these up easily.  They are so abundant as to be glaring, which shows a blatant lack of professionalism.  Sure, any author can make typing errors, but come on.  Don't they pay editors for this stuff? <br /> <br />Second, the writing is amateur.  Certain parts of the story lag, others seem rushed.  It also appears, at times, that Nylund simply did not do his research.  To the best of my knowledge, naval officers do no salute indoors.  This is also assuming that this navy of the future kept with old traditions.  Yet at other times, it seems Nylund would like us to do the research ourselves.  For instance, there is one point where the Master Chief is referred to as \\"Petty Officer.\\"  Yet about 2 pages later, in the same chapter, Nylund refers to him as \\"Master Chief.\\"  This was confusing to me until I found out that the full title of a Master Chief is, in fact, Master Chief Petty Officer.  There are many other errors, such as giving the MC command of a \\"squad\\" of 75 \\"soldiers.\\"  Typically, also to the best of my knowledge, the group would be divided into 5 or possibly 6 groups, each with it's own squad leader. <br /> <br />Third, and last, there are a parts of the story that just don't seem to mesh.  The ending seems rushed.  For those who've played the game, the MC seems to be a mysterious character, with little to no contact with the ship's crew, just the captain and soldiers.  However, this book makes it seem as if he and his team are fixtures on the Pillar of Autumn, with their own quarters.  I can't figure out a way to properly describe this, suffice to say that Nylund gives this point a different feel.  And, to end this with a glaring question mark, am I to believe that these children were taken from their homes and put right into military training without complaint?  How about a little realism?  Not a single \\"I wanna go home\\" or \\"I want my mommy\\" from any of them.  They're six years old! <br /> <br />I digress.  As I stated, an interesting story, but I believe Bungie should have fought for some creative control of the story.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I saw Sufjan Stevens (pronounced soofyahn) perform live last night in Phoenix and was simply blown away. I have to mention that I only discovered him about 2 months ago while browsing Amazon for a new Iron and Wine release. Stevens was recommended and an \\"If You Like... You'll Like..\\" artist. I listened to some samples, bought \\"Seven Swans\\" and played it about 30 times! Then I purchased the all the rest of his CD's including this latest one \\"Illinois\\"<br /><br />Sufjan Stevens is on his way to becoming a major artist. Think - a mix of Iron & Wine, Simon & Garfunkel, early Beck, early CS&N, with a healthy dose of Phillip Glass. Stevens manages to expand the boundries of each of those artists. Just as Beck experimented with sampling, Stevens experiments with time signitures, instrumentation, structure and harmonies. He'll take the long repeating chorus which is usually at the end of a song (ala Hey Jude) and put it at the beginning of the song instead. Paul Simon's poetry is rooted in Grenwich Village; Stevens' is rooted in Flint, Chicago, Detroit.  He uses brass that sometimes sounds like a Salvation Army Band. He'll switch from a plaintive banjo to a blistering electric guitar. The music is not spit-polished with 28 overdubs to get 1 note right - it is recorded in churches, basements, livingrooms... It's raw, its real and it is intoxicating. Stevens' music is INTERESTING, FRESH and UNIQUE!<br /><br />His live show was a real trip... back in time. I felt like I was in a 1st period high school assembly/pep rally and the drama club was putting on a musical presentation! As cheesy as that may sound, It's NOT. The music is inspired, played by inspired musicians. His poetry is patriotic, unpatriotic, biographical, sad, inspiring. \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr\\" sends chills up my spine.<br /><br />SUPPORT THIS ARTIST!!!! BUY HIS CD's!!!! You will be getting in on the ground floor of a major musical force.
0316172324|1.0|A mis-mash of other peoples findings, not even pulled together into a cohesive whole.  Thought the book might have some original ideas about how to change our snap judgements - NOT SO.
B000002OTL|4.0|All I have to say is, what a great movie soundtrack. However, in order to get full enjoyment from this CD, you really need to see the movie first. By doing so, when most of these tracks play, you then should have a flashback of the very scene in which was happening during THAT certain song. 'PulpFiction: Music From The Motion Picture' features a variety of surf, funk and guitar rock tunes. Some of the better cuts include Dick Dale's \\"Miserlou\\", The Tornado's \\"Bustin' Surfboards\\", Dusty Springfield's \\"Son Of A Preacher Man\\", the twist song Chuck Berry's \\"You Can Never Tell\\" and the unlikely Neil Diamond cover \\"Girl\\" done by Urge Overkill (remember those guys?). Well worth checking out.
B0001EKZOQ|4.0|If you like traditional Flamenco singing accompanied by piano with Jazz overtones, this album is for you.  The best part of buying from Amazon is that it costs 23 euros in France (about $28) and less than half of that from Amazon.
0060751967|5.0|Warning:  Contains spoilers <br /> <br />Roman Draganesti is a storybook white knight, who would like nothing better than to take a bite out of crime when he encounters a damsel in distress.  Actually, that should be black knight, and he can't take a bite out of anything because he loses his fang at the beginning of the story.  The only person who can help him is a squeamish dentist who doesn't know he's a vampire.   <br /> <br />Roman is a fresh take on the modern day vampire.  Having taken advantage of his eternal life by earning several advanced degrees in science, he has spent his time perfecting synthetic blood to feed vampires who must have the substance for survival while also saving potential human victims from his customers.  When faced with the possibility of a vampire war, he adamantly refuses to risk any lives, if it could be helped.  His genuine caring for others is evident in the way he hypnotizes Shanna Whelan so that she will replace his missing fang.  Instead of simply bending her to his will to do as he wishes, he actually helps her overcome her fear of blood with his suggestions.   <br /> <br />Shanna Whelan is the perfect mate for Roman.  She is headstrong and bold, even if a little fearful of the Russian mob members who wish her dead and the vampire friends of the man she falls in love with.  Her encounters with Roman remind her that she doesn't really belong anywhere since being placed in the federal witness protection program, and her feelings for him make her want to be a part of him.  She is never able to convince herself that he is the demon that vampires are supposed to be, not only because she is so dangerously lured to him, but also because she knows that regardless of his circumstances he is a good and honest man.  <br /> <br />Kerrelyn Sparks handles \\"How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire\\" with expert fluidity and wonderful storytelling.  The novel moves seamlessly between hilarity--such as when Shanna believes Roman is \\"dead\\" and thinksshe has killed him--and moving poignancy as Roman finally discovers the depth of a gracious God's forgiveness.  In between both extremes are pages upon pages of hot, steamy sexual attraction between Shanna and Roman.  This is a must read, not only for romance lovers, but for all readers who enjoy a story well told with laughter and tears. <br />
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril performs a function. She plays music for the kids who have outgrown Spongebob Squarepants and Barney but aren't ready for the likes of Strapping Young Lad or Wilco. The kids are too young to go to clubs to see real bands.  They're too young to understand more mature bands or music. How could they when the only thing they are exposed to is the mind numbing commerciality of MTV and commercial radio? How could they when the lyrics might be about love or loss? I don't think most kids have any experience with those kinds of adult themes. So I can't blame them for liking Avril. She has great songwriters to provide her with meaningful teenage and preteenage material about Sk8ter boys and such and a competant band of studio musicians to back her. For Junior High or Middle School kids Avril is entirely age appropriate and I can't begrudge the kids their fun. Eventually when they get into highschool they'll move on to more \\"mature\\" bands like Good Charlotte or Interpol or maybe even Elliot Smith or classic bands like Black Flag or Led Zeppelin. Until then, have fun wearing ties and T-shirts, I know my twelve year old does. But seriously if you're over the age of 18 and think that Avril is one cool and righteous babe, it's is definitely time to open up your eyes and get off the farm.  If you want righteous music made by strong, intelligent women who rock I'd get some Ani Defranco or Sleater Kinney and leave this commerical, manufactured kid stuff behind.
B000002HFU|5.0|ODB's first joint is amazing. Lyric wise not one of the sharper swords in the WU he makes up with it, with his unmistakable energy. Of course, stellar production throughout the entire LP makes this a definite own!
B000002540|5.0|Almost all the songs are from BOC's first three and strongest albums: the black and white albums; so called because of their incredibly cool black and white covers. The three songs not found on those albums are the covers: Born To Be Wild  and Maserati GT(I ain't got you) and the excellent instrumental showcase Buck's Boogie. Every song on this live album is better than it's studio counterpart. They're much more powerful, better sung in most cases, more emotional and the solos more heady and wild. There's not a bad song in the bunch, oh yeah and unlike today they didn't overdub the songs in the studio to fix live mistakes. Which makes this album the finest in BOC's career and one of the best live albums of the seventies. It's just that good.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Ghostface & Rae once again bringin us a hip hop classic. A lot of cameos by the WU but not taking the show away from ghost. When he gets on he kills it everytime. Cop it!!!
B00029LNHS|5.0|When the Black Eyed Peas suggest \\"Lets Get Retarded\\", you better listen and start smashing your head against the pavement, because lacking a few billion brain cells enhances this album no end! In fact, if you do like this album, keep smashing your head all the way to the record shop and buy 10 copies of this album, the Black Eyed Peas deserve all the money they can get, after all they're not in it for the riches and fame, but for advancing the culture of modern music.
B0000024LN|5.0|E double hooked Reggie up with the perfect beats for him to run through. Redman's lyricism is better than anything you have ever heard him(or anyone else) do before. Plain and simple.....its very much HIP HOP!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I do not know how I missed \\"The Machinist\\" when it first came out, but am glad that the current interest in Christian Bale brought it to my attention.  Bale is always someone you cannot take your eyes from when he is on screen, and no more so than in this movie.  He is skeletal and weak, as a man who has not slept in a year, but oddly determined to solve a mystery that unfolds to him as it unfolds to the viewer.  Everything \\"works\\" in this movie-the color palate, the supporting characters, the atmospheric score.  There is not really redemption in the end for anyone, but there is palpable relief.  So I recommend this movie-it is well-written, well-constructed and entertains and one can watch the career of a truly wonderful, potentially great, actor progress.
B0000024JA|5.0|Method man's flow........ Need I say more! Backed up by witty punchlines and that early 90's production from Rza and company this is a must have in your collection.
B000002WYT|4.0|The album was decent but the best song on the album was crash into me.  The other songs were ok but nothing to write home about.l
047119350X|1.0|In fanciful dispensations, Voet and Voet smarmfully eludicate the chemical Wilberforce in high cheeky hotshot wowness.  Let it be said, that Biochemisty hipness and spongecake sheets are as tasty as a Walrus in cherry frosting.  Nevertheless the principles forsoothed may swoosh the sandy breezes and jumpin beans through the tight green pants.    Did you understand any of this?  Neither will you understand Biochemistry by Voet and Voet.  This book would be more useful as a library reference than as a textbook, because the detailed double-column pages tend to dilute the biochemistry relevant for beginners. If your chem department is using Voet and Voet, it means they want to cast a spell over you and mystify your mind.
0767802470|5.0|My two uncles were german submariners in the 2nd WW. Both survived, and I had the opportunity to meet the one that was a commander. Although he would not talk much about his experiences, I was able to extract from him his opinion of the TV Mini-Series when it came out. With the exception of the noise levels that crew members made in the movie (for drama purposes) he told me that it was a very faithful depiction of the life and hardships a submariner lived on a U-Boot. <br /> <br />I personally have always admired the film because it depicts war without glorifying any of the participants. You are not guided by the director or the plot to identify with any particular character - you can actually relate to many of them, and therefor immerse yourself in the claustrophobic experience they live. <br /> <br />Its an excellent piece of film making that combines drama and action into a very powerful anti-war message. Although I personally prefer the original mini-series, the directors cut with its remastered sound is also a great experience.
0792839730|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Attenborough weaves a fascinating story, containing rich characters, that moves to a satisfying conclusion. Goldman's script doesn't give short shrift to the Americans, Brits, or Germans. The actors' performances are first rate. Connery, O'Neal, Gould, Caine, Bogarde, and Hopkins are at their best.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is great....all the songs are awesome. Christina really tells it how it is in this CD if you are looking for some good music to listen to this CD is one for sure.
B0009H1CK6|4.0|I was excited to purchase a live CHIC dvd especially since I have an immense respect for Nile Rogers.  The band is tight, and well rehearsed, and they play the songs with love.  The rhythm section is great, Omar Hakim is a great drummer and plays the songs as they should be.  The Bass player, is also very good, and plays the songs the way Bernard would have wanted him to.  The female vocalist do an excellent job, and the female keyboard player is also very good.  The male keyboard player was, not so impressive.  The sound quality for a live performance, was above average but not excellent.  This performance is good, but do not expect it to be better tham the original.
950491036X|3.0|<br />Following the enormous success this book has had in Spain and abroad, I decided to purchase it. And the novel it was not a dissapointment at all. Ruz Zafn has written a nostalgic, hard and grey story. Exactly as it was Spain after the civil war. And that is probably one of its main values. The ability for depicting the misery and lost that people felt in those terrible years. La sombra del viento drinks, literally and literarily in the sources of the most classical tradition of novels in Spain. Since Pio Baroja, to Galdos and the whole generation of the 50's. A careful depiction of sceneries and people that helps the reader to get into the story. And even when this is a mistery novel we can find also some slight touches of the traditional \\"feulletin\\". So I would say it is a very enjoyable novel. Easy to read, very well written and I had a great time reading it. But, yes there is always a but , there is not so original as the beging made me thought. The idea of a cemetery of books was really appealing but slowly the story turns to be a good thriller written with a very good style. And the end although correct for the developement of the story left me wanting more. No more drama or story but depth. I have the feeling the writer wanted to end as soon as possible, and this is really disapponting.  <br /> <br />Ruiz Zafn has the skills and the manners but I think he could be more adventurous and reach the last consequences of the story.  <br /> <br />
0060930187|4.0|Victoria Lucas wrote this fictional novel, but it is based on Sylvia Plath's real life. Which makes sense, considering Victoria Lucas is only a pseudonym for Plath. This is the closest anyone will ever get of an actual Plath autobiography, which is sad, because The Bell Jar ends leaving many questions unanswered. <br /> <br />Plath's own scholarship was at Mademoiselle Magazine, where she was a guest editor for a month. Esther's patron, Philomena Guinea, is based on Plath's own patron, Olive Higgins Prouty, best known for writing Stella Dallas and Now, Voyager. The individual who was the character base for Joan later sued after the book was published under Plath's real name following her suicide. The court ruled in her favor that she was unfairly branded as gay in the novel. Esther's suicide attempt is a mirror image of one of Plath's own. Both the main character and the author under went electroshock therapy, which also links the protagonist with the Rosenbergs, who Ester refers to in the opening, reflecting on their execution in the electric chair. Coincidently, Plath left two children behind after her suicide, as did the Rosenbergs.  <br /> <br />Its disturbing to read the Bell Jar, knowing how true to life it is and what happens to Esther in real life. Plath continues to be an enigma and the Bell Jar does not offer any insight into who she really was. It is difficult to connect to Esther Greenwood. She follows through life, disconnected, winning awards for her writing and flying through college on scholarship. Eventually, she wins a chance to spend a summer working at a New York magazine. Her first friend is Doreen, a \\"dirty common slag\\" that Esther would rather not associate with but wants to emulate. Losing her virginity to punish her boyfriend Buddy Willard for losing his becomes an obsession for her.  Not that she really loves or even wants Buddy to be her boyfriend. Unfortunately, she feels that she is unable to leave him once he is diagnosed with tuberculosis and sent to a sanatorium.  <br /> <br />The novel is going along well until Esther is sent home. Up until this point, the character is realistic and sympatic. However, once she moves back home, her motives become unclear. Mental illness, depression included, is always unclear, but it is difficult to understand Esther. Before, the reader felt as if they were experiencing all this with her, as if they were there. Afterwards, we are just watching her go through things, not really getting a chance to feel what she feels. Esther, upon returning home, suffers insomnia and sees a psychiatrist who gives her electroshock therapy. Esther makes several suicide attempts, the final being when she crawls into a cellar and swallows 50 sleeping pills. She is sent to a mental hospital, where is meets and makes new friends, including Joan. <br /> <br />The Bell Jar reads as two books. The first book is a character study of a young girl in New York. I enjoyed this half. The second half is a confusing mess. However, it is not bad. As two separate books, both would stand on their own and would be very good. However, the tie between is leak and together, two excellent books become a merely good one. Three stars for the book itself, the extra star for the impact it had on society. <br />
B0009IW88A|5.0|Two Superb Composers (and friends) combine to create an excellent complimentary score for the film BATMAN BEGINS. Rising to heights at proper points ... laying in wait in others. The Music does not overwhelm the drama.
6305428042|5.0|We love Hocus Pocus because it's entertaining for both my 3 year old and for us adults.   I love seeing Bette Midler and SJP play such croney characters.  It's a really cute movie.
0007165013|5.0|This book is fabulous! It's my favourite novel lately and I can just recommend this book to everybody liking humour as well as heartshattering stories... <br /> <br />Well, why this book is one of my favourites: <br />Alex Steward and his best friend Rosie are growing up together. Their connection is strong enough to stay years and years of pain, luck and the most irritating thing... fate. When he moves to Boston one year before graduating at High school,Rosie can be hardly happy. When Alex is supposed to come over for the debs ball, something keeps him at home. But that night should change Rosie's life. The hotel - fanatic girl planned to move over to Alex in Boston, where the two of them  wanted to study. Instead Rosie becomes pregnant and nine month later little Katie is born.  <br />What I can report now is - without telling the whole story - is that Alex is getting married twice and Rosie once. And though, through all those years they loved each other with all their heart. They just had a bad timing.  <br />At the end a small surprise waits for the reader, a surprise that perhaps nobody would have expected and I do not mean the final love meeting between Alex and Rosie, but find out yourself and feel the joy of being taken onto a rollercoaster of emotion.  <br /> <br />Don't be surprised, the book includes a lot of emails,letters, etc... <br /> <br />Have loads of fun with WHERE RAINBOWS END!!!
B000021YQV|5.0|This album for me gives me hope that more bands like these guys pop up. As for the review that says this album is in \\"some bratty ten year old's room\\" dude get a life. Maybe if you pay attention to what the songs really say you may get it. It takes an open mind to get what Serj is saying in the songs.  <br /> <br />       1.Prison Song- A great song about the prison system, corrupt police, and what the government really does with drug money. 10/10 <br />       2.Needles-A song about addiction. Takes a few listens to get what it means and then you are still a bit confused.8/10 <br />       3.Deer Dance- A classic SOAD song, with a lot of aggression and a slightly political message. They should have put this on the first album though. 7/10 <br />       4.Jet Pilot- This song confused me until i found out that its about a horse longing to fly. They must have been smoking something and then wrote this song. Definitly should have been on the first album.5/10 <br />       5.X- one of the shortest songs besides deer dance and jet pilot.this song really seemed to have no point. 3/10 <br />       6. Chop Suey- One of the best SOAD songs. Its also one of the singles of this album. 10/10 <br />       7. Bounce- A happy little ditty about an orgy. Gosh what were they smoking when writing some of these songs? 8/10 <br />       8. Forest- This is a good song. It means a lot of things to different people.You have to listen to it and draw your own conclusion. Love it though. 10/10 <br />       9.ATWA- Sounds like a song about a breakup. Serj's voice sounds so sorrowful and Daron's backing vocals make the song perfect.10/10 <br />        10.Science- a song about science missing the most potent element of human existence. Which is Faith. love it. 10/10 <br />        11.Shimmy- Has a great message. Don't be late for school again!8/10 <br />         12. Toxicity- The title track off this album. Its about the city life poisoning its inhabitants , which i take to mean is their home townof LA. One of the best singles off the album. 10/10 <br />         13. Psycho- The only thing memorable about this song is Serj shouting \\"Pyscho!Groupie!Cocaine!Crazy!\\". 3/10 <br />         14. Aerials- The best melodiac/hard rock song out there. No other band can make a song that will even come close to it.100000/10 <br />  All in all this album is way worth buying at any price. I do reccomen picking a copy up. get mezmerize with it because you can't have one without the other.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy.  The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie.

0393324818|4.0|I just finished reading this book, and it is fantastic.  It is well written, intriguing, well developed.  But there's one fault.  Everyone is quick to rate Billy Beane as a genius, and ask how does he do it?  But keep in mind, as well as the A's have done, what has playing 'moneyball' done for the Oakland franchise?  If I recall correctly they made the playoffs for four or five straight years under Beane, but failed to advance, or threaten seriously. Is on base percentage more important than average? Ground ball outs more important than ERA? Is Beane better than Steinbrenner?  Their jewelery would say otherwise.  Before we annoint Beane the crown prince of baseball we must remember that although his teams are built well to win in the regular season, he has yet to get a sniff of any success in the playoffs.
B0001CCXY8|1.0|Cannibal Corpse.....now I know these guys are supposed to be the next big thing in Death Metal, but honestly, this band is bad. Yes, the guitar solo's are good, the guitars are good, the drummer is alright, and as for the bass player, you could never hear him becasue of the guitars. There are too many times in their songs where they sound as if they're playing any random note or chord. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of heavy metal...but this stuff is just horrible and stupid. How perverted are these lyrics....constantly talking about all of this gore crap in ALL of their songs? I mean ask yourselves, what is the point about CONSTANTLY singing about raping, tortuing, and beating women, killing people, ripping out people's insides, ripping off people's skin, talking about certain body parts, butchuring and killing babies, talking about maggots, venom, and death? (just to name a few of the VARIOUS gory topics they talk about) and just writing horrible music like that? I mean these guys think its cool and think it's a joke but it isn't. The guys from Cannibal Corpse keep talking in their interviews about how their lyrics aren't supposed to be taken seriously, but if that's true, then why are so many people mad about it? I thought heavy metal lyrics were supposed to be about your emotions and feelings, or about how you're angry at life, how you're sick of certain things. I thought lyrics were supposed to be meaningful. Cannibal Corspe is heavy no doubt about that, they're probably the heaviest band you'll meet. But I don't feel right listening to their songs, realizing that this is the stuff they talk about. You can be able to tell that this is a putrid band just by looking at the artwork on the CD cover or the song titles. But you know something, I think these guys are doing it just for the attention, to be honest. No one else has written these kinds of lyrics before, no one has made violent graphic disturbing artwork on a CD cover like this. I really think this is done only for attention. Everybody likes them because of how \\"cool\\" and \\"tough\\" Cannibal Corpse looks. Cannibal Corpse probably thinks that takling about beating women, killing babies, and all of that sort makes them look tough, and is a way of selling albums. Oh yeah, that's tough, but I bet that they never have the balls to do that in real life. It should be illegal to write music like this. Why write lyrics about things that happen in for other people's unfortune in real life? This stuff shouldn't be taken lightly and taken as a joke, it shouldn't. The band Cannibal Corpse has been a band for about over a decade, and made LOTS of albums, but the sad thing is, they haven't changed their lyric style AT ALL. A whole decade of nothing but \\"GRRRRR EEEEEEEE, smelling a girl's insides, it was so enchanting, EEEEEEEE, I raped her and then beat her on the head with shot gun, while masterbating to it, EEEEEE OOOOOOOOOOH, and it was exicitng, then I go outside, and see zombies, EEEEE, with venom and blood dripping from their heads, and maggots flying out of their skulss, EEEEEE then I hack out their brains then eat the brains, the gooey water flowing from their insides tasted good to me as I drunk it up, GRRRRRRR, OOOOOOOH, EEEEEE\\" in ALL of their songs. I mean how stupid is that. See, even I can write a Cannibal Corpse song, I just did when I just gave you that example. Seriously, anyone can just sit down and write gory scary lyrics like that, I bet even a 6 year old could do it. I mean I'd rather listen to Avril Lavigne than to listen to this. And their music is not THAT great. The solos are good, but just the music they play in general gets old after a while, becuase all of their songs sound the same and you can't tell the difference between any of them. This isn't good music at all. This band would be a whole lot better if it wasn't for the extremely perverted lyrics, and if they started being more organized with their music, becuase like I said, their are parts in their songs where it seriously sounds like they're just playing any random note/beat/chord. This is not worth your time listening to at all. Listen to some good metal bands like Lamb of God, Black Label Society, As I Lay Dying, Trivium, Rammstein, System of a Down, Static-X, Necrophagist, Mastodon, and the best guitarist ever, Jimmy Hendrix. Just don't waste your time on this...it's not music, just garbage.heir songs where it seriously sounds like they're just playing any random note/beat/chord.

006097625X|5.0|A Must Read Book for any person interested in Sequential art and in particular essential for Comic Aficionados. It covers far more material than what its suggested by the title. In synthesis, BUY it!, you won't regret it...
B00004TWZF|5.0|Great music, beautifull senery, nearly a comic but with sutch a sad ending... <br /> <br />Directors cut additional 45 minutes explains the story so much better!!! Don't even consider buying the shortend version. <br /> <br />One of the best movies I know.
B00005RG6B|5.0|One of the few prog metal released that deserve a five stars rating in my opinion. But this album is probably the best live album I have heard(and seen on DvD). It was after the release of the Empire album, that Queensryche decided to promote the band's previous album and well appreciated masterpiece, Operation : Mindcrime with a sequence of live performances of the whole album on stage. In this album, Queensryche prove that actors or special setting are not required to set up a theatrical, dramatical background for the album's scenario. Just a not so used video-wall, and an amazing performance by the band's lead singer Geoff Tate. The songs are reproducted amazingly, as in most Queensryche concerts up to that date, and Tate's vocals are not only reaching up to the album levels, but also moving further, as his voice combined with his movement on stage and the general aspect of acting, promotes the results to the greatest. Starting of with a sample of I Remember Now, the band enter to the second track Anarchy X, and then Tate comes on stage for Revolution Calling. Notice the change of lyrics to be fitting to present circumstances, as critisism goes on. Operation Mindcrime, Speak and Spreading the Disease in a frenzy atmosphere with no mistakes at all, and then a rather theatrical version of the Mission with Tate singing on his knees. The highlight of the concert is definitely Suite Sister Mary, with Pamela Moore on stage. This one gave me the thrills, really, I almost cried with seeing this one. Then, the needle lies and the frenzy goes on. The album live reproduction proceeds until the end with breathtaking carry outs of I don't believe in love and Eyes of a Stranger. Then the album ends, leaves you there, wanting for more, and really not aware of what has happened. In the DvD version of the album, there are some information that explain part of Operation: Mindcrime's story, for those willing to find out more about the album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A good DVD collection of the short-lived TV Series. A fine ensemble cast of unique characters with believable strengths and weaknesses. The series is set in a SciFi universe which is more believable than the \\"gleaming future\\" where technology solves all problems (and resolved unresolveable plot problems) and enlightened mankind lives in harmony with everything but sometimes evil aliens and sometimes unenlighted humans who haven't seen the light yet ... well you get the picture.   <br /> <br />A gritty bunch of lovable anti-heroes. Highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you haven't seen this mini-series, buy it today.  It is without question the best Mini-series in the history of Television.  Steven   Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced this magnificent show based upon the incredible book written by Stephen Ambrose.  This true story chronicles the experiences of the men in easy company of the 101st Airborne division during WWII.  The show begins at boot camp and takes you all the way to D-day and then to Hitler's lair at the end  of the war.  The acting, special effects, video quality, sound quality, charachter development, writing, and direction are equal to the best hollywood has ever produced, for the big screen or small screen.  It is an incredible journey; one that I will never forget.  There is a documentary at the end where they interview surviving members of easy company.  I literally had tears in my eyes as I listened to these heroic and humble men tell of their experiences.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I like the Phantom of the Opera, I really do.  The key word here is \\"Opera\\" which the director fails miserably in capturing by casting Gerard Butler.  He may be a good actor and acted out the part of the Phantom well, I must say, but the Phantom is supposed to have a soaring, operatic, wonderful voice.  Butler, sadly, just is not a good singer.  Before you jump down my throat about being a purist, I'm NOT a Michael Crawford fan.  I don't think he can sing either.  Why didn't they cast a real operatic talent for the film?  Australian star Anthony Warlow, for example, would have been an ideal choice with his classical operatic training and experience as the youngest Phantom ever.  I'd even take Colm Wilkinson over Butler. <br /> <br />Butler's inability to sing aside, the sets were marvelous and the rest of the cast was superb, especially Christine and Raoul.  I'm glad they cast Raoul with a good singer and not a squeaky weakling like so often done on the stage.  Carlotta was hilariously perfect and Piangi was, well, Piangi. <br /> <br />For those who want to see a beautiful cinematic portrayal of the musical, this is the movie for you.  But when the beauty falls in the background and you focus on the main character, don't blame me if you cringe during Music of the Night.
B00005JNZ4|3.0|Quirky John Cusack and lovely Diane Lane: seems like an interesting pairing by anybody's casting standards.  Trouble is, this movie just doesn't seem to be the vehicle for them as a couple.<br /><br />I love watching Diane Lane on screen, and this movie was a visual feast for Diane Lane fans.  She's a fascinating beauty, and delightful in every way, yet in this movie I couldn't help noticing how contrived her scenes (or was it the director's touches?) seemed to be.  She seemed posed instead of natural in almost every scene.<br /><br />I've also enjoyed John Cusack's energy in every movie he's been in, and this was no exception.  In this movie, however, his scenes showing his angst about dating often seemed overplayed in relation to subsequent scenes that indicate he's suddenly transcended all his own internal questions, and then fallen into them again shortly thereafter.  Again, this confusion stems from a director's choices, not an actor's.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was fine, but used very conventionally.  I was even dismayed by Christopher Plummer's Irish accent, which seemed non-existent in his first scene but blossomed thereafter.  The only reason I felt compelled to think about it at all was that the dialogue reflected his Irishman status...<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney was such an obvious plot foil it was painful when he showed up.  Yes, the audience should often have an advantage over the characters in a story, but this was used again so conventionally that his role was more of a backhanded effort to add spice to a predictable plot, and, as such, failed.<br /><br />Disappointment in this film comes from a director who is TOO conventional with a conventional plot.  I don't fault the actors, though, so if you like this cast, see the movie for what THEY do, not what the director does to them.
0316776963|3.0|I purchased this book because I am a fan of Christopher Moore (Fluke, Lamb, Practical Demonkeeping, etc.) and a friend who also enjoys CM recommended David Sedaris. Well, the Me Talk Pretty One Day is adequately entertaining, but nothing spectacular. If you are a fan of light humor, or are interested in reading from the perspective of a gay man who doesn't make his homosexuality the focus of every short story, you might enjoy Me Talk Pretty One Day.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this show when it came on TV and now that I own it, I'll probably be watching it all the time.  I managed to watch this whole set in 3 nights.  Joss Whedon is the greatest creative mind since George Lucas!  Serenity - September 30th!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I think her voice is amazing, so soothing. I love her songs from Bob Dylan and Hank Williams.  She is great.
0739316478|5.0|I haven't finished listening to the entire audio, however the story is a compelling travelogue of life in Italy, which is lots of fun to follow. Im certain that the intrigue will have me sitting at the end of my  chair, as I delve further into the story. At this point, I'm savoring word by delicous word.
0060090383|5.0|My first book by Keyes was \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" -loved it.  Than it was \\"The Other Side of the Story\\" -loved it.  \\"Sushi for beginners\\" was slow, I did not like it as much, but was not as bad as that awful Weiner and her awful book \\"Good in bed\\", that people love and I could not finish.  I was on a roll with reading Keyes, so I was a little hesitant to buy \\"Rachel's Holiday\\"- totally worth every cent!  It is such a thoughtful, inspiring book.  I just loved it.  Well, I am off to go buy another Keyes book!
0486411818|4.0|The service is excellent, the price of the book is according to the product, the content is good. I live in Chihuahua, Mexico and I am very satisfied.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is my first Josh Groban cd and I LOVE IT !!! His music is spectacular. It definatly calms me down on those hectic days.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|I was a real fan of the original tripple X.  Finally, we had a spy, although unlikely, was a bit more believable than Bond.  The plot, other than a comic book type crazed killer, was intruigeing, the tempo was beyond belief, the sound track was good, and the hero was a stand-up guy.  I liked the concept of a protagonist that began as a self-centered thrill seeker who gradually turned into someone that saw true evil and decided it was up to himself to make things right.<br /><br />  I was anxious for a sequal, and upon the previews, wondered why Vin did not return.  After seeing the film, I soon discovered why (he most likely vomited while reading the script).<br /><br />  The film started with a gripping plot.  Gibbon's (Samuel Jackson) branch of the NSA is attacked by unknown high-tech assailents.  Most of the branch (made up of Gibbon's military team)has or is in the process of being assasinated.  Gibbons decides to go further out of the box, and recruit a member of his former SEAL team (Ice Cube), who is currently searving time in military prison (for insubordination and punching his commander, portrayed by William DeFoe).  A prison break is exicuted, and Ice Cube becomes the new xXx.<br /><br />  From therein, the plot and Ice Cube's charactor becomes downright offensive.  In a nutshell, William DeFoe's charactor is planning to unseat the president...why?  Because the president is a Clintonista liberal who wants to understaaaaand our enemies, turning the other cheek to attacks and showering them with aid.  The \\"evil\\" DeFoe, instead, wants to strengthen the military enough to be able to properly defend the country (this is evil?!?  Apparently so, and why terrorist attacks seem to continue.)  DeFoe's charactor believes the only way to do this is to enact a small coup on the capitol building.  It's up to a bunch of unrepentant gang bangers/car theives to save America.  Unlike the original, where there is charactor developement, it is absent in the sequal.  Other than a side National Security head man, no one else seems to care why they are trying to rescue the president, just what's in it for themselves (especially the gang bangers; they are in it for the right to jack cars in D.C.).  Oh, yes, did I mention ample gratuitous black on white racist cracks (especilly comapiring an NRA chairman to a Ku Klux Klansman)?  I used to like Ice Cube (in movie roles), but after starring in this garbage, well, I have to throw him in the same bin as other Hollywood RDDB's (I'm very surprised someone the caliber of Samuel L. Jackson would appear in something like this unless he was bound by contact).<br /><br />  Well, guys, if you are going to make another xXx similar to this debacle, here's your plot:  Right wing radio talk show hosts have invaded the capitol.  Gibbons goes further out of the box and springs an ex-Al Quida member from Guantanimo Bay.  Together with the help of the ACLU and GLAD, explosions and lawsuits fly and anyone to the right of the loony left is overcome by compassion.  The president disolves all the armed forces, and every dictator in the world is so overcome by our understaaaaanding, that they all throw down their guns and step down from power, and the world is at one with peace.  Hey, it's in line with the sub plot of this movie, and the way a certain group of writers in Hollywood seem to think.  And they wonder why box office reciepts are down.  Please excuse me while I snap in \\"Seargent York\\" so I can see what Hollywood was at one time and feel like an American again.a side National Security head man, no one else seems to care why they are trying to rescue the president, just what's in it for themselves (especially the gang bangers; they are in it for the right to jack cars in D.C.).

B000002UEB|5.0|This album has it all and so does the group. It's a conceptual album as all the songs are related to the story. This album makes Pink Floyd's the Wall look boring in comparison. The story is dark and the music is addictive.When I first listened to it I really didn't pay that much attention to the lyrics because the music blows you away. But eventually the words will take hold of you. The album is like a heavy metal version of Phantom of the Opera. The lead singer Tate has an operatic like voice. The drummer Rockenfield is one of the most creative drummers in rock. And the guitarists & bass player are instrumental to the songs. In fact everything they play makes the songs what it is. This album is so good that the band Queensryche has a cult following on this album alone.
B000002J2F|4.0|I guess you could say Duke is where Genesis invented neo-prog--simpler playing, stripped down arrangements, but enough originality and complexity to keep you interested. I envision a host of semi-pretentious, somewhat talented musicians at the dawn of the 1980s, listening to Duke, saying, \\"Hey, we can do that!\\" and ushering in the love it or hate it neo-prog movement.    Of course, no one would ever do neo-prog better than Genesis and Duke is proof. It's accessible--heck, it's even got a couple of hits on it--but there is still plenty for the prog enthusiast to digest. For many fans of the genre, it's the last Genesis album they can stomach; indeed, there's a lot to like here.    Key to the strength of the album are the pieces that bookend it, \\"Between the Lines/Duchess/Guide Vocal,\\" and \\"Duke's Travels/Duke's End,\\" two major parts of what is commonly known as \\"The Duke Suite.\\" These two extended pieces stand up to anything the band has done in their career.    \\"Duke's Travels/Duke's End\\" is a kind of pared down, neo-prog parallel to \\"Los Endos\\" which ends A Trick of the Tail--a long instrumental with a dramatic build up, culminating in a dynamic re-phrasing of themes from other parts of the album before it fades out.    The opening three pieces, which flow seamlessly into each other, demonstrate the essence of what makes this album work for me--the band sounds passionate and absolutely committed to the music. This is especially true of Phil Collins' vocal delivery. He communicates the yearning of the fan in \\"Between the Lines\\" with such fervor it seems to come out of a spiritual hunger, which explains why for years I thought the song presented a somewhat nebulous illustration of a person struggling in his relationship with a higher power.    Collins' singing also contributes to the success of \\"Duchess,\\" which may be my favorite Mike Rutherford song despite its simple structure. Phil infuses this tale of a fading diva with a fair amount of desperation, pathos and power. Rutherford has mined similar territory before, most notably in \\"Ripples,\\" but never in a way that cuts so directly to the emotions of the listener.    As for the hits, well, \\"Turn it on Again\\" manages to be quirky and catchy at the same time, and is probably the archetype for what a neo-prog single should be. Collins' \\"Some Misunderstanding\\" doesn't fare as well. It's a little too basic. The same can be said for the drummer's other solo songwriting credit, \\"Please Don't Ask,\\" although that song is made poignant by the sadness that Collins manages to get across as he anguishes being separated from his wife and son after their divorce. These two songs provide an indication where Genesis would soon go, and for prog fans it wouldn't be pretty (\\"Man on the Corner,\\" anyone?)    The rest of Duke falls somewhere between the highs and lows, with enough highs to provide a pleasant listen. I haven't really gotten tired of the album since I re-discovered it a year ago, and this is coming from a guy that considers \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" to be the ultimate.    There are other drawbacks. Departed guitarist's Steve Hackett's influence on the sound continues to be missed (it's very rough) as is his technical skill. And there's that matter of the drum machine (!) But Genesis always rose to its greatest heights when the band played with feeling and commitment. And there's plenty of that to go around on Duke.
044651652X|5.0|I read High Plains Tango recently and enjoyed it very much.  Up to that point of time, I had avoided reading or seeing the movie of The Bridges of Madison County.  That avoidance probably was related to a number of reviews or complaints that I heard in the past.  However, in traveling through Iowa about three times in the past year and noting the signs for the Covered Bridges of Madison County, I developed a new interest in them as well. <br /> <br />I read this book in two days, and I found it to be poignant, witty, controversal, brilliant, and well written for a first novel.  The manner in which the story is told is deftly woven by Waller - he has it told from narratives of Francesca's children, from writings of Robert Kincaid, from an interview with a jazz musician and by letters from Francesca to her children, among other forms.  We are in wonder as to whether Waller is writing his own memoirs or just putting himself in the place of narrator. <br />Regardless, it is extremely well written in that respect. <br /> <br />The book has flaws, though not as many as a number of other reviewers have noted.  It is a love story about magical moments.  It contains adultery, but that subject is a way of life, whether we like it or not.  It is a touching story, and it reaches out and grabs the hopeless romantic in all of us that wants to believe in a love that is that strong. It is also a story that can see different turns or alternate endings contemplated. <br /> <br />I am glad that I read the book for myself and did not rely on various critiques of it.  I will now watch the movie to see how Mr. Eastwood has dealt with the subject.  What is amazing is that both Eastwood and Redford are always criticized for their attempts to bring poignant novels to the screen, and that criticism is usually not warranted. <br /> <br />I would suggest that anyone wanting a magical mystery tour ride on love should read this book.  It is magical and haunting and makes us think about the pathswe wander all too easily in this thing called life. <br />
B0002NRRAG|5.0|As people probably know by now, Madeleine Peyroux took an eight-year hiatus after releasing Dreamland in 1996. But now she's back with a cover album, Careless Love. Now, in this day and age, making an album full of covers might seem like the easy way out, but she still does an excellent job on these standards.<br /><br />One thing I noticed, though, is that a lot of the negative reviews are saying that Madeleine isn't Billie Holiday. I don't exactly know why people think she's trying to BE Billie Holiday, but nonetheless, there are good covers in Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" and Hank Williams' \\"Weary Blues\\". Another good track is the French-language \\"J'ai Deux Amours\\".<br /><br />Madeleine also does well on the one original song, \\"Don't Wait Too Long\\", which is what I suggest you do when it comes to buying this album. Pick it up for some smooth sailing.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0385513755|5.0|I can't imagine reading this book without these pictures.  If you are not especially knowledgable about art or art history, this book makes a world of difference.  Everything else about the book is the same as the standard version, so I will leave it to those reviews to rant and rave about what an awesome  read this is.
B00000F14B|4.0|The Music Man is one of Hollywood's music Classics.  Robert  <br />   Preston's performance is superb, along with Shirley Jones  <br />   who help make this film an all time classic and one for the <br />   DVD library.  <br /> <br />   Eric
0783240236|2.0|Hints are dropped in virtually every significant scene in this film that Melanie Daniels is in fact Mitch's sister; one could easily pick it up on the first viewing. So you can imagine the surprise when I searched for this movie online and saw virtually no discussion of this mystery. Let's overview the scenes:<br /><br />CATHY'S PARTY SCENE<br /><br />Melanie tells Mitch that her mother \\"ditched us when I was eleven and ran away with some hotel man in the East,\\" and that she does not know where her mother is. This opens up the possibility.<br /><br />Then she says \\"Well, maybe I ought to go join the other children\\" drawing a parallel between herself and Cathy. Also note that Cathy is turning eleven, the same age as Melanie when she was abandoned. After this scene we cut to a shot of Lydia with a cold, worried glare at Mitch and Melanie. Immediately afterwards is the most violent bird attack by far up to this point begins. This should hint us that what has just transpired is an important scene.<br /><br />ANNIE & MELANIE DISCUSSION SCENE<br /><br />What is behind Lydia's worried glare? Listen carefully to Annie's mysterious speech to Melanie in their night together. Annie explains Lydia was hostile towards her because Lydia was \\"afraid of any woman who can give Mitch the one thing Lydia can give him--love.\\" Melanie suggests that Lydia is jealous/possesstive, but Annie emphatically denies this two or three times. So why is Lydia so keen on giving love to her son? Could it be that she feels the need to compensate for a child she didn't give enough love to? Also, why is Lydia hostile to Melanie when her hostility to Annie was heavily influenced by the recent death of her husband? Annie says that \\"it's probably different now\\" since years have passed since that death, until Melanie corrects her. What other factor could be driving Lydia's hostility now?<br /><br />MITCH & LYDIA KITCHEN SCENE<br /><br />It's clear here that Lydia already knows more about Melanie than Mitch does, though she's afraid to show it. Mitch tells her they met in a bird shop, and Lydia asks incredulously \\"She was selling birds?\\" even though she already knows that wasn't the case. This is revealed later when she asks \\"She's very rich, isn't she?\\" (Lydia already knows Melanie is), Mitch says \\"I suppose so\\" and Lydia then reveals that she has read a detailed article on Melanie's antics in Rome. Mitch knows about this too, but his worldly professional life in San Francisco enables him to recognize a wealthy heiress. None of the other people in the town or film who she is at all. Why is Lydia the only Bodega Bay resident to know so much? Why does she try to hide it? Could it be she knows something about Melanie that the others don't, and is trying to keep it a secret? What secret could that be?<br /><br />LYDIA & MELANIE MEET SCENE<br /><br />When Lydia is first introduced to Melanie, she is so shocked she cannot even respond to a \\"How do you do?\\" In fact throughout the whole scene while Mitch and Melanie are talking, the camera REPEATEDLY cuts to Lydia's face, which remains just as shocked throughout the whole conversation; her mouth is slightly parted the entire time. This clearly goes beyond merely the suspicions of a possessive mother, especially for a first meeting, since Lydia doesn't think there's any romantic between Mitch and Melanie's until she mentions the lovebirds, later in the conversation. Melanie clearly notices Lydia's intense stare, for she turns to Lydia and says \\"A gull hit me Mrs Brenner, that's all\\". Why is Lydia staring so intently at Melanie? Why is Lydia so shocked at first she can't even speak? Could it be that Melanie was once an important person in her life?<br /><br />LYDIA & MELANIE CONVERSATION SCENE<br /><br />This is the scene which clinches it. Lydia almost breaks down mentally in a near convulsion of extreme guilt over her children, without obvious cause. She berates herself \\"I'm not like this you know, not usually. I don't fuss and fret about my children.\\" Why is Lydia acting this way and confessing these intensely personal things to Melanie--a person she has barely known for one day? Which child did Lydia not \\"fret and fuss\\" about enough?<br /><br />Later when Melanie asks to go, Lydia begs \\"No, don't go. I... I feel as if I don't understand you at all and I want so much to understand.\\" Melanie is clueless here, she asks \\"Why, Mrs Brenner?\\" After a moment Lydia replies cryptically, \\"Because my son seems to be very fond of you, and I don't know quite how I feel about it.\\" But the highly emotional Lydia of this scene is not acting like a woman who is sizing up a potential daughter-in-law. Her line \\"I want so much to understand\\" is heartfelt and passionate, not calculating. Why does she want so much to understand Melanie? What does this have to do with her paroxysm of guilt over her children in this scene? Could Melanie be the child that Lydia is guilty about and who Lydia wants to understand?<br /><br />One could say Lydia's action are simply because she is just possessive and doesn't want Mitch to become attached to any woman. But Lydia says \\"I want to like whatever girl he chooses\\". What about Annie? It's made clear in this scene (and supported by others) that Lydia cannot stop Mitch from getting a woman if he really wants it; Annie had overstated Lydia's importance in the failure of her own relationship with Mitch because she loves him and cannot stand his rejection. Go back to Annie's confession scene and see that her answer to Melanie's question about why her relationship with Mitch failed is very weak. So we have reason to believe Lydia here when she says \\"I want to like whatever girl he chooses\\"... so why is she so upset about Melanie? On her way out she calls Ms Daniels by her first name. Why has Lydia suddenly gotten so personal without solicitation if she's suspicious of Melanie? It's not the experience with the Birds... Melanie continues to act extremely politely; their bonding does not really come until the very last scene.<br /><br />Lydia is a complicated, mysterious figure who goes around most of the film with a look of worry or even horror on her face. Many have remarked on her resemblance to Melanie. It is made clear that she is a widow of a wealthy man, and small hints in many scenes build up to the conclusion that Lydia has some special reaction to Melanie associated with guilt over her children, and an inexplicable wariness over Mitch and Melanie's relationship. Many mysterious and diguises abound in this film; certainly it is not really a film about birds but about people. But more deeply, certain mysteries are never explicitly solved at the end of the film. Yet they are thrown out there quite obviously. Watching the scenes and listening to the dialogue carefully informs one that Lydia's behavior is indeed explained by her knowledge that Melanie is her daughter.<br /><br />I give this movie two stars for its ingenuity.personal things to Melanie--a person she has barely known for one day?

B00005JNBQ|3.0|Okay, I liked this movie. But two things got me to start hating it.  <br /> <br />First, TOO MANY GODDAMN 10-16 YEAR OLDS LOVE THIS MOVIE. Everybody has Napoleon's trademark \\"God! Flippin' idiot\\" on iPods and such. It was funny the first time. Now everyone's going around wearing shirts that say \\"OMFG TATER TOTS\\" and it's really starting to piss me off. I don't see people wearing shirts related to more independent, even cult, movies nearly as much. <br /> <br />Also, it wasn't as funny watching this the 2nd time. In fact, it was really boring. Because \\"Flippin' idiot\\" isn't funny the 19th time around. Most scenes dragged out and the good scenes weren't as often as the annoying quotes. <br /> <br />If you are a half-minded idiot who likes movies with half a plot (well, I will admit that's kind of like me) you will love this movie. But if you hate hearing the same lines repeatedly, you probably won't be able to bear it.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|can it get any better than this?   i dont think it can!  PLEASE pick this CD up TODAY!  also...if you like Ryan Adams you need to pick up something by Jesse Malin...too good!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is by far one of the funiest movies I have ever seen.  Taking the zombie genre and turning it on its ear, by using the gore and some mudane references to the best use.  While the movie does loose some steam halfway through, it picks right up at the end.  The extras are funny, and some of the cut scenes actually add to the final result.  Add this movie to your colection!
0966638328|4.0|This book was good. But I don't care for the color combination. They arn't practical. Every color combination is missing a base color. And the colors in the book don't reflect the colors on the screen. <br /> <br />But it's the best book on color that I've seen yet.
0060254920|5.0|This book was a favorite of our little boys 40 years ago.  It is still the perfect baby gift for your friends who have boys.  Max was naughty and his mother sent him to bed.  This is the story about how little boys use their imaginations to conjur up adventures even in their bed rooms, at night, with the lights off!!  Delightful
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Oh my God!! If you're a Slipknot fan, this CD is definitly something you people should buy!!! <br />I bought this CD a couple months ago and it's one of the best albums ever! Though, I gave only 4 stars because I wasn't too happy with the acoustic songs, I found them too slow for Slipknot. <br />My favourite songs on the album were definitly<br />- Duality<BR>- The Opium of the People<BR>- Vermillion<BR>- Pulse of the Maggots<BR>- The Nameless<BR>(and it I'm in the mood for softer music) <BR>- Danger, Keep Away<br />The lyrics in the songs were very well writen, &quot;The Virus of Life&quot; has fairly creepy lyrics like 'I can see you but you can't see me' and 'It's unbearable, it's almost worse for me <BR>I'm gonna to tear you apart and make you see'. I loved the lyrics for &quot;Vermillion Part 2&quot; with lyrics like 'She is everything to me, The unrequited dream, A song that no one sings, The unattainable' which seem to have a lot of meaning. I especially loved the lyrics to &quot;The Nameless&quot; with parts like 'Obsession, take another look. Remember, every chance you took. Decide, either live with me, Or give up - any thought you had of being free'.<br />To top in all off, the songs were very awesome! Talk about 'ear candy', almost all of the songs on here are so creative, and the fact some of the songs can be a totally screaming competion and then turn into complete harmony and then switch to eerie whispers and rap which is actually good!<br />Personally, I think this album is one of the best ones I've heard though I would of gave the 5 stars if they didn't have the accoustic songs, I felt it was a major turn off. But, please, if you are a die-hard Slipknot fan, you should buy this!!
B000002KKD|4.0|It's a fun little album.  I enjoy all of the songs there, and actually like The B-52's version of \\"Downtown\\" better than anyone else's.
B000687M48|4.0|If you love Evanescence check out this DVD/CD!! You wont be too dissapointed!<br />I love this DVD/CD a lot, and I enjoy watching the live concert and the behind-the-scenes stuff! Though, the life vocals of Amy Lee in the concert can be a bit of a let down if you just listen to the CD. If you buy it, you should really watch the live concert first to see why her voice sounds a bit weaker, I mean if you were jumping around like that on stage you'd get pretty weak vocals too! But I wouldn't say it's a waste of money like some people say, it's an awesome DVD and Evanescence should really be proud of their newest creation thus far! <br />I'm definitly looking forward to more CDs by Evanescence!
B00005JNZ4|2.0|Admittedly, I am not the demographic for this film. As hard as it tries to cross over and appeal to guys, it can't transcend the boundaries of \\"chick flick\\".<br /><br />And it isn't even a good `chick flick' at that. Yes, I've seen my share.<br /><br />Sarah (Diane Lane), a recently divorced preschool teacher, is lost when it comes to the dating scene. Her `crazy family' comes over for dinner carrying pictures of eligible guys they want to hook her up with. Her brother-in-law doesn't know of anyone, so he brings a picture of a model from a magazine. After dinner, as they leave, they each pin their picture to her refrigerator. As her father (Christopher Plummer), older sister Carol (Elizabeth Perkins), and other brothers and sisters leave, she begins taking the pictures down. Carol also posts Sarah's profile on a singles website under the heading `Must Love Dogs'. She goes on a couple of dates, all of which end in disaster. One day, at the preschool, she realizes that Bob (Dermot Mulroney), a single dad, is really attractive and they begin flirting. She also goes on a strange first date with Jake (John Cusack), a recently divorced wooden scull builder (no, not kidding) who answers her ad.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Dogs\\", which is actually a very apt name for the film, just remove the `s', is that the screenplay is terrible. Diane Lane and John Cusack are very likable actors and this story would seem tailor fit for their personalities, but they both are simply boring. The story is about Sarah, yet, the only thing we ever learn about her character is that she needs a man in her life to feel happy. Not very enlightened or interesting. We never learn about her hobbies, her interests, anything except that she needs a man. Her character serves as a vehicle for writer/ director Gary David Goldberg to introduce all of the other wacky characters in her life. Except that they aren't that wacky. Dad is an aging widower who lies on his singles website profile, he also juggles three women at once, one of whom, Molly (Swoosie Kurtz, er... actually, it's Stockard Channing, but it's difficult to tell them apart these days) really falls for him and sticks with him even when he has a harem of women around him. Carol buys meat for Sarah to give to each of her dates. Are you laughing yet? I know, I wasn't either.<br /><br />When Sarah and Jake meet for the first time, each of them borrows a dog. I guess Sarah loves dogs so much she doesn't want one in the house. Jake borrows the dog of his friend/ lawyer. The dog is really cute, but their dialogue, which is supposed to smart and witty, is just painful. Jake questions why Sarah put voluptuous in her profile. She gets offended and they make more pained small talk before she leaves. Remarkably, she goes on another date, with similarly awkward circumstances. Then, inexplicably, they are racing around town looking for a condom. This scene might have been funny, if the two characters even seemed remotely interested in one another. Instead, Lane's Sarah is depressed and dour all of the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Goldberg seems stuck in the TV landscape he has lived in for so long, he created \\"Family Ties\\" and worked on many others. He feels it necessary to create wacky situations rather than to create real characters and let the situations come from their real lives. The father's harem, the condom race, Sarah's riding a boat out to meet Jake, all of these situations are so contrived. Normal people don't act like this. Normal film characters don't act like this. TV characters act like this. I half expected Plummer to do a pratfall and land at the feet of a blonde and brunette who console him by rubbing up and down against him.<br /><br />Yes, you \\"Must Love Dogs\\" if you are going to like this film.e also juggles three women at once, one of whom, Molly (Swoosie Kurtz, er... actually, it's Stockard Channing, but it's difficult to tell them apart these days) really falls for him and sticks with him even when he has a harem of women around him.

0805076476|5.0|Few books feel like a punch in the face when read, but Fight Club, by Chuck Palahnuik, definitely hits you hard. Depicting our world as a lost one, one without hope and compassion, it tells of a insomniac who uses support groups, and crying, to fall asleep at night. Until a woman shows up, another healthy person touring the support groups to find a one night band-aid for her emotional problems. Thats when Tyler Durden, a man who makes soap out of human fat, and uses the money to fund his anarchist ways, steps in. Together they create Fight Club, and off the story goes. The ending is a good one, one most wouldn't have thought of by the time the Narrator and Durden are standing in the building they've rigged with explosives. It's not a happy book, and it tells no lies, and Palahniuk proves that nihilism can come from strange corners.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Live Aid. All of the disks are great, especially the first one with all the British acts that were popular at the time. The documentaries about the famine and relief efforts were very dramatic and touching.  <br />After watching the DVDs, I only wished that there was more. I know there were a lot of performances missing and I would love to see them. But I am not complaining much because the quality of what is available is so great.
0440217563|5.0|Another great book in this series. It's amazing that Diana Gabaldon can keep a story line going without losing quality, interest, novelty, or suspense. I highly recommend all five in the series....this third one is wonderful.
6305144176|5.0|i love good morning vietnam because robin williams does an amazing job of balancing humor and drama. this is one of my favorite movies of all time, and i highly reccommend it to everybody. you've got to watch it more than once, because you'll see something new or catch another sly joke each time.
0792151712|5.0|the title says it all. I loved the part where Rose & Jack were running through the halls of the titanic while it was sInKiNg. that was so funny! the visual effects were clearly amazing and took a while to do-and the acting was believable.
6305696071|5.0|ever since watching pretty woman, i've harbored a secret desire to be a prostitute... but only if richard gere will be my knight in a white limo! richard gere and julia roberts are great together, and this is a movie i have watched over and over, most recently just two nights ago. the music is great, and i love the brown dress vivian wears to go see the polo match. all in all, this movie is a must-see!
0596007124|5.0|This book is great at making the concepts stick.  This is great for anyone wanting to learn more about OOP design.
0553212621|1.0|This book was SO moving. It brought up a few important issues, like sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, and guess what?Sex!It is disgusting how the world has become nowadays. It's disgraceful!  God-fearing people, stay away from this book!!!!<br /><br />It's trash for your mind and brings up perverted topics. You shouldn't read this book. We didn't. It's a book of scandal, corruption, seduction, and SIN!!!!
0385513755|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is not as good as Brown's previous novel \\"Angels & Demons.\\"  In fact, the \\"Code\\" could be considered \\"A & D Light\\" because of parallel storytelling that resembles initial conventions in \\"Angels & Demons\\".<br /><br />The previous book is much more suspenseful and has a better villain in the group known as the Illumanati.<br /><br />The Code is still a good read, however.  And the illustrated edition is worth it for the prints and pictures alone.  The illustrations almost make the book an educational resource in allowing the reader to see prints, artifacts, etc. as they are discussed in the book (hence the 4 stars - the story deserves only 3).<br /><br />Brown does a good job in bringing out the mystery surrounding the \\"sacred feminine\\" that runs through the plot with emphasis on Da Vinci's many secrets. Still, as thrillers go, the plot is a bit weak and the suspense is forced.<br /><br />Worth a look although the reader will be disappointed if Angels & Demons is read first.  Try the code first and then prepare for a roller coaster ride type thriller in Angels & Demons.
0292701934|5.0|I think this book is amazing. The stories really gives you a deeper understanding of why Richard Avendon picked his subjects. Laura Wilson does a great job documenting the step by step shoots of Richard subjects \\"In the American West\\". I really felt after reading the stories and looking at the pictures again, it meant so much more. These pictures showed the truth and some of the people in the photos agreed that \\"It's how I feel\\".<br /><br />I recommended this book to anyone, who is looking to find a sence of meaning to their craft as a artist. This book makes to think about yourself, and what you can do to give depth to your work.<br /><br />I wish other art book would explain the process of their work. Then more people would enjoy what they see instead of brush it to the side.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I haven't bought a Foo Fighters CD since their debut album, and if their latest is any indication, I think I've been missing a lot. This collection of songs is fantastic, and if it had just been released with the first CD it would've been great. But I have to applaud the efforts of Dave Grohl and the gang for trying out the much slower paced second CD. It succeeds beyond my expectations. Dave's voice has a lot of range, and the songs are beautifully written.
B000001ZSE|5.0|The cd is among one of my best purchases of music over the years: made me wonder why I have not bought it earlier. My opinion is - if music makes you feel happier do not spare the resources to get. And that is exactly how my husband and me have been feeling - happy - since repeatedly listening to Jarre's collection. It mentally transfers us to the years of our youth - the fabulous eighties. A great buy totally worth the money if you are into cosmic, electronic, computer music.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I was introduced to this band about 1 year ago and bought their 2nd release, entitled Waking The Fallen. I was quite impressed and eventually considered them one of my top bands to listen to and when i heard about their new cd, i was quite excited. The things i loved most about their previous release (WTF) was the texture of the songs, not only the vocals, but the music. It was metal. It had feeling, it showed emotion. I cannot seem to find any of this emotion in the new cd.  <br /> <br />I really do not know where avenged sevenfold has gone! The ballad of \\" I wont see you tonight\\" is possibly one of my favorite songs. But i hear NO songs like this on the new cd, in fact, it seems to me that they have tried to speed everything up and take away the slower, more epic/emotional sounding tracks. And if you think that seize the day would be one of those tracks, i think you are totally wrong. I think that they should have credited Guns and Roses with that song, because i consider it a total rip off of their style. <br /> <br />As a musician, i believe that Ax7 decided to set the metronome during the writing process to blistering speeds and said, hey, lets write really fast sounding songs and throw in unnecessary lyrics about demons and \\"making a beast out of myself to get rid of the pain of being a man\\". What the hell are you talking about?  Did i miss something here? <br /> <br />This album is good to listen too, but compared to the last album, it isnt worth my time to compare.  <br /> <br />Give me a break
B00008YJH5|4.0|The front of the case had a somewhat large crack down the middle of it. Otherwise, perfect in overall condition.
0312330529|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  It was a great read, and had a riveting story line.  The characters were very well developed and well rounded, and you just had to love all of them.  The language was wonderful, if at times florid.  This guy reminds me somewhat of Thomas Wolfe.  Also, it is a nice long book which gives you a lot of time to love this protagonist, the characters, and really get into the story.  I just finished this book and intend to reread it very soon.
0975991477|5.0|Greetings, <br /> <br />For many of my 64 years I have wrestled with the quandary posed by apparent contradictions in my reality, that of accepting my experiences in both the physical and the paranormal (paraphysical?) realms. <br /> <br />Bruce Lipton's The Biology of Belief has changed that. I find there freedom. I find the freedom to BE a player in a very large game. <br /> <br />May all always be happy! <br /> <br />Love <br />David <br />  <br />[...]  - Empower Unity <br /> <br />\\"So, why not choose a future that works for all?\\"
B00005JNTX|1.0|When a studio releases a quickie bare bones disc then a special extended edition later it's called \\"double dipping\\". They expect Sin City fans to shell out once then when the cool edition comes out to shell out again. <br /> <br />This practice is becoming increasingly uncool. Tell them you aint gonna play by passing on this disc and picking up the special edition when it comes out later this year. <br /> <br />What can you expect on the special edition? Well, if it's anything like the two \\"Hellboy\\" releases, everything that's on this plus a little bit more. <br /> <br />Worth the wait? Up to you.
0060752610|5.0|A must for amataurs, professionals, finance students worldwide. The text covers a lot of ground - not just common stocks but all types of bonds also. Personally I enjoyed reading the 1970's edition with Warren Buffet, but this edition looks better on your shelf! You won't be disappointed with this book, Graham's insight and writing style suit all ages. He takes a long run, value driven approach to investing that you will find expands your view on investing like no other book written before or since.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'd never really listened to Green Day much, I heard a bunch of songs when Dookie came out, and I was mildly amused by their three-chord anthems, but basically passed them by, but still thought they were good musicians writing clever music. Then someone told me to get a copy of American Idiot. I hear so many different genres referenced here, from pop to classical, and I'm really impressed. Listening to this music, I starting thinking to myself...\\"I Smell Thesis!\\"...and I'm still kinda thinking that. <br /> <br />Anyway for everyone who says that Green Days fanbase is mostly 13-21 year olds, take it from a guy who is almost thirty, this is a great album. <br /> <br />And for everyone who says that they've jumped on the f*(k Bush bandwagon, this is what has happened throughout history. The country gets polluted by evil people, and they start making bad decisions and the people start realizing it, but how much of our frustration gets out there? Not as much as you think...so artists start saying what so many of us want to say, but our voices aren't loud enough. If you don't agree that's fine, but just remember that these songs reflect what a great deal of people in this country feel is going on, both here in the US and abroad.
6305971099|3.0|Part five does not have the atmosphere as part four but it keeps the mood the film starts off wih a quick recap.  The main reason this film does not succeed as well as part four is because Dwight Little was not the derector some french guy was and he made this the goriest so far (Later sequels got even gorier)this was a fun sequel with some scary scenes (the luandry shoot and Tina being all by her self after the party)Killing off Rachel was a mistake (Mostapha Akkad said killing of Rachel was the bigest mistake in the series) I really liked her charecter in part four but the film is still good I would recommend it if youre a Halloween fan
B000A6CLL0|5.0|One of the best seasons of ANY Star Trek series.  It's an amazing and fun comeback that gets better as it goes.  Season 3 contains some of the better elements of the Deep Space 9 arcs and rectifies some problems with Voyager (like the ship never showing damage).  The minor character casting and chemistry problems were less noticeable in Season 3.  The Xindi arc was exciting and original (5 species forming one race) and the effects were exceptional.  The acting was excellent and alive, thanks in no small part to a great supporting cast.  If this had been season 1 of Enterprise, the show would still be on.  You'll be thrilled and amazed with this set. It's well worth the price!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />great supporting cast<br />Sphere Builders and Xindi = great, classic aliens<br />brilliant effects<br />excellent writing, good emotional scenes<br />Trip is a character instead of the village idiot<br />the ship takes on serious damage<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />some episodes feel like filler<br />virtually every alien species is hostile<br />tacky sexploitation of Jolene Blalock<br />worst theme song in history<br />writing falls back on cheap tricks like erasing memory and time travel<br />the Xindi weapon looks like the Death Star
B000683VI4|4.0|This movie really touched my heart.  The story line was awesome but the ending was a little bizarre. I have recommended this show to everyone I know as a real \\"rainy day show\\" and to definitely have a tissue close.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best Science Fiction series ever.  I have watched many and I can honestly say it really is wonderful.  Why?  Because it doesn't rely so heavily on special effects or a lot of hype.  It simply is great characters, interesting plot progression and a decent story.  The actors are excellent and have a wonderful dynamic.  There is something for everyone no matter what kind of person you are or what kind of character you like.
6305428050|5.0|I would have to say that this is one of my favorites.  Highly recommended to everyone.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There are several reasons why I have to say I appreciate Coldplay.  Yes I realize that their sound is similar to other bands, but then again, there is hardly anything new under the sun and many bands exist in a cliche.  For example NIN's repetitive nihilism and fatalism and curse words laden songs are insulting and worthless and each song TR writes sounds the same because of these factors. If you listen to one album by NIN, yes folks, you listen to all the albums.  Yes you can say that about Coldplay, but as I will now demonstrate, CP is far more superior to NIN and that like.<br /><br />First and foremost the songs themselves have intelligence within their structures.  Wisdom is found in what we see of the written lyrics, both thought provoking and humorous.  Whether the songs are written to question life and existence and nature or the songs are written to reach out to lift someone out of their darkness, there is appreciation to be found within CP's song ideology.<br /><br />Second of all, every other lyric isn't a curse word (like System of Down) or sexists (like Eminem) or written just to insult Christians and Christian parents (like Marilyn Manson).  Parents can honestly trust and listen with their kids to the CP works, and many of the songs have wisdom that can be discussed between fans and parents and teens.<br /><br />Third, the sound is in itself esthetically pleasing.  Such a consideration is last because I realize that you can say the same for other bands, but as you can see, I think CP is superior to many of the other bands you see now on the MTV or VHS.  The songs weave together a tapestry to create awe inspiring sounds and effects.  Adding this factor to the first two factors, one cannot help but be drawn into the weave world that CP is able to so easily create.<br /><br />Here are some other bands I have found to be worthy of a listen to, yes these are Christian rock bands, but that's not a problem: Newsboys, Sonicflood, Third Day, and Philip, Craig and Dean.lip, Craig and Dean.
B00000DHRX|5.0|great cd - has all the hits and more! the liner notes and picutres are also outstanding.
1591396190|5.0|This is a significant book that will shape the way we think of innovation, technology, and getting out front of the competition.  I recommend it for anyone who aspires to build a company, change a company, or just see the future unfold.
B000031WI8|5.0|thank god for imports - great cd! really brings together all the great wham! songs from the '80s. i highly recommend this to all!

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I'm not one for purchasing female vocals, but I heard these angels sing by chance and knew I had to own it to repeat the pleasure again and again.  They are as pure as chimes, bells, a harp song...you get the picture...pure and smooth.  A joy to listen to and affordable.
0671027344|5.0|One of the best YA books I've read.  I loved Charlie so much, I thought it might be weird that I was so involved in his life.  I couldn't stop thinking about this book and about Charlie--even days after I'd finished it.  And then like Charlie, who gives his favorite books to his friends I had to give this one away to one of mine.  It was hard.  I loved this book!  More please, Mr. Chbosky.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera was an excellent film. I'm not a big fan of opera or musicals but this movie really caught my interest with the great music and singing. As soon as I finished watching it on PPV I knew I wanted my own copy. I found everything about this movie to be outstanding, including the settings, the cast, the music, the acting and much more. Another plus is it was all done without \\"Adult\\" language being used in every other line. <br />Bravo for the movie The Phantom of the Opera.
B0009XRZ9W|5.0|This movie is destined to become a Christmas classic for all ages. The effects, narration, and the very overall integrity of this movie lends itself to \\"classic\\" status. We took our grandchildren (their first visit to the movie theater ever) and they were totally enthralled with the movie. Finally, someone has put out a product that all ages can enjoy without fear of some adult themes creeping into a scene etc. If you want to turn back the hands of time in your own life, or you just want to enjoy a Christmas movie with your family and friends, then by all means, please, get this movie. I'm 51 years old, and you can bet that when this becomes available, I'm buying this movie!
B000059XUO|1.0|Stop giving this movie a high score just because of the circumstances, does it all of sudden make this movie great? You know it doesn't deserve a 7.x on IMDb. It's a stupid, worthless movie. This fails on several, if not all levels. I couldn't even finish watching this cheesy movie, half of this juvenile trash was enough for me before I finally gave up being sadistic enough to torture myself with this.<br /><br />This has such bad and unconvincing acting, especially by the star of the film, Brandon Lee. A movie with a poorly executed story is made even harder to watch when the star of the movie couldn't act his way out of a house with no walls (therefore no roof, think about it). His wife got raped and killed, what is he supposed to be, angry or campy? Why is he making jokes as he toys with his victims? This is like a damn cartoon for 10 year olds. If the movie didn't take itself so seriously, then I wouldn't mind that performance choice so much. Everything from the script and the dialog was formulaic. How can anyone think this is a great movie? It's not 100% horrible, but it ain't Spider-Man, it's Elektra, enough said.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Listened to this song in my car after purchasing. I bought it because I liked the first album and I liked the song feel good inc. I was not to impressed the first time listening to this album because it is different from their first. Darker and more original is the best way to describe it. After listening a 2nd time with my Senn hd650 headphones I was was stunned. Details and sounds were revieled that I could not previously hear. All I can say is the second time I listened to this album I loved every second of it (though I didnt car for \\"Dirty Harry\\"). \\"Fire Coming out of The Monkeye's Head\\" and \\"DOnt get lost in Heaven\\" are two increadible pieces of music (especially with a good setup). Honestly this is one of the Top 5 albums I have every heard (Behind Pink Floyd- Wish YOu Were Here, Oasis- Whats the story mourning glory, Jimmy Hendrix-Band Of Gypsies, Shpongle- Are You Shpongled, then Demon Days. Most of the music on this album can be MUCH better appreciated with good headphones, however if you give this album a few chances its melodic beats and vocals will reward you greatly. Get this Album now!
B000044TZU|1.0|Well, this is just going to tee off all the Merchant fans. My wife was looking for a version of \\"When They Ring The Golden Bells.\\" I searched around and found the one on this album. Merchant's voice is paired with that of Karen Peris. The arrangement is direct, uncluttered, backed by excellent musicians. The result is sublime.  <br />   Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Red Alert, Red Alert! Reality Disconnect! Earth to Natalie! PHONE HOME! <br />   If Merchant ever wants to be anything but an ethereal voice meandering among the clouds she needs to do more work like \\"Golden Bells,\\" over which her fans are probably scratching their heads. But I doubt she will, based on the CD photos of her, which are as shallow and pretentious as her music. Proof she knows how forgettable this CD really is: \\"Golden Bells\\" is the only track that cannot be purchased separately. It certainly is the only one worth buying. That rates it one star.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|An excellent concert with exceptionally gifted guitarists playing at their best.  Many different styles are played but all done well.  Good but not ideal camera shots at times, but the quality of the music and the performances make up for it.  An amazing collection of artists worthy of any rock/blues collection.  I'm glad it is on DVD because I'd wear out the tape with all the playing. <br /> <br />I'm an old aspiring guitar player that gets inspiration from watching good artists.  This is good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ever since a certain late 60's sci-fi sitcom (*ahem* trek) laid the groundwork for the genre, we've gotten more of the same: cheesy, heartwarming, and optimistic to the point of idiocy. This is nice in some cases (Star Wars), but, let's be frank, we've all had enough. This is the 21st century and we can handle something more than that.  <br /> <br />So along comes 'Firefly'! It's irreverent, playful, and funny, but it maintains a realism and seriousness that gives much more weight than most sci-fi. Kudos to the writers for having the courage to put characters and relationships before mindless techno babble! Sci-Fi isn't really about realigning the Tacheon pulse beam or what will go wrong with the holodeck in the next episode. It's about creating a world different than our own, but one inhabited by people not much different than us. This way, no matter how foreign the world is, we feel a connection to it and are drawn in. That's what 'Firefly' does and that's what makes it so satisfying to watch. <br /> <br />And check out 'Serenity' in your local theathers on Sept 30th!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am always intrigued with the creative sensibility of Japanese anime movies.  I believe this one tops most of the criteria of an artistic expression of the people who made this.  I could not believe myself fixated thru the whole movie even for the realization that it is for one, &#34;animated&#34;. I'm also a Disney fan in which Walt Disney created Snow White to push the boundaries of human emotional experience through a connection of related life's experiences. He succeeded in that endeavor that audiences laughed and cried to an animated movie. Snow White however still possesses the human qualities in each character. In Miyazaki's Spirited Away, the elements of human qualities were mashed up with fantastical beings and still delivers the emotional connection to the audience. This is one of the best animated movie due to its creative, imaginative, and intuitive story and animation style. The DVD version, which this one is, still resulted in a very clear picture even in a big screen TV. I'm sort of interested to see the bluray version if it actually going to have a great impact since the DVD is already of great video quality. In any case, this movie is a classic Miyazaki collection.
B0001YRVN4|3.0|The discs seem to be of poor quality.  My son who is 3 watches these movies over and over again and I think by the 6th time he watched it they get stuck or scratched or damaged. <br />So I only give it 3 stars because the discs are not very durable.
B00004YA66|5.0|Loved this movie.  So intriguing.  Kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering how it would all end.  With computer literacy, shouldn't this be possible?  Science fiction at its best.
B00005QFE5|5.0|What a sweet story. What wondeful restraint and gentle performances. This one is for lovers. It shows that sometimes less is more. This movie reminds me of why I married my wife. Seeing it for the first time made me go out and buy it right away. This one is not for the cynical. If you're a true romantic, I hope it will touch you like it did me.
B000088E6D|5.0|This is one of the best cd's in my collection. And I have a lot. He is a mixture of the best of Sinatra, Dean, and Harry Connick Jr. Absolutely marvelous.
B000002KHF|5.0|This album was a masterpiece thirty years ago. It still is. It holds up so well.
0743455967|5.0|Half story, half guidebook, all wonderful. Mr. King loves writing and inspires one to read and write, face hundreds of rejections, and have a great time. He gives a few very helpful don'ts, but mostly he fans the flame and shares the love. I'm sure my copy'll look worn soon enough.
B000085RTX|5.0|I prefer Epica and The Black Halo over Karma, but this is the first one that got me into Kamelot so it deserves its place right below those outstanding albums. Khan's voice is still great here and Thomas Youngblood has some really tasty riffs and solos.

B00006J3WH|5.0|A must have for any Buffy fan!  The majority of BtVS fanatics love the Once More With Feeling episode so, of course, those fans will LOVE to be able to hear the songs from the show.  But these songs are awesomely cute (good music too!) and I think would appeal to those who are not even familiar with the show.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|DAS BOOT -- Hands down the best war movie I have ever seen. The actors do a fantastic job and the director makes the viewer feel as if they are in the sub as part of the crew. I think the question is ... is this version worth the purchase over the previously released \\"Director's Cut\\"?  For those of you like myself who love the movie, my answer is confidently YES. You get more insight into the characters.  For example, we learn more about the navigator and the first watch officer. The story is also told from the perspective of the navel correspondent, thus making it more similar to how the story is presented in the novel. However, if you are enthusiastic to have your friends see Das Boot ... show them the Director's Cut because it's approximately an hour and a half shorter. Wathching the uncut version straight through is a tough time commitment and the last thing you want to do is watch this movie over the course of a few days.  For some reason I found the picture quality of the uncut version to have been slightly inferior to the previous release.  As well, they changed some of the subtitles and how they are presented. Nevertheless, this version still gets four stars.
0975991477|5.0|This book is a must read for every individual who wants to understand the potential of their body! Bruce H. Lipton presents his material in a form which lay people can understand. Parents should read this book to realize the effect their beliefs program their childrens physiology.
B000005IZ8|5.0|Powaqqatsi is my favorite of the the three qatsi films (although I haven't seen all of the last one in the trilogy). <br /> <br />This is also my favorite piece of music of the movies, and the best word I can think to describe is \\"glorious\\". <br /> <br />Philip Glass has created something enormous here.  He plays with 2 or 3 themes and repeats them over and over again in different ways, yet the music never becomes dull.  Listening to it on CD, it sounds even better than what I remember from the movie ...
1591396190|5.0|Finally a new view on strategy since M. Porter's Competitive Advantage. This book is a must have and must read.
0446677450|4.0|Great interesting book - gives you alot of knowledge on how to manage your money so you can strive to be rich. wonderful story of robert's two dads, and an eye opening look at why the rich are rich, and the middle class are not. although this book does not give you an detailed instructions on how exactly to become rich, it is a starting point. really simplifies the accounting structure - especially for me, i cant even do simple math! but i could understand most of the concepts in this book. however, if you are already experienced in brokerage, money management, etc, you may find this book too simple. either way it is a great way to think outside the box when it comes to investing... i only wish robert would give us a more detailed path to follow... exactly where to invest etc... but then again, i guess he cant give away all the secrets! the point is that you learn for yourself and do your own thinking! a great quick and easy read..
B000002L9W|4.0|This should have been VH 7 because the next best thing is this cd. not 5150.any way this disk is solid if you like DLR and the orig. Vh<br /><br />I like it, after this the quilty starts to slip for DLR on his next albums ,but I am a fan of his music and will get more anyway.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|An excellent DVD. The Eagles are in rare form for sure, but lets compare it to the Hell Freezes Over DVD. *** = Winner <br /> <br />Freezes: 4:3 ratio only <br />Melbourne: 16:9 ratio only *** <br /> <br />The size filling my 16:9 HDTV is a welcome change for concert DVD's. Seeing this concert in full glory does bring a better experience than a 4:3 ratio concewrt <br /> <br />Freezes: 5.1 Dolby Digital EX *** <br />Melbourne: Dolby Digital DTS <br /> <br />You'd think the true separation of the 6.1 separate tracks in Digital DTS would be superior to the sound quality of the 5.1 Dolby Digital, but only the format is superior, NOT the actual sound quality of the recording. I think the Hell Freezes Over DVD was recorded using free mikes mixed with the line level input from the stage mikes -- you hear the audience when they aren't quiet, and you hear the amient sound from the concert hall. Although this could be distracting with a lesser quality mix, the Freezes DVD is done VERY well and sounds better even on my 7.1 Denon component system. While the Melbourne does have a better format, the sound quality sounds more like a mixed CD because it seems very little ambient \\"concert hall sound\\" was allowed into the mix, making it a very \\"sterile\\" studio recording sound. So, while it is a good DVD, I think the \\"live\\" audio recording quality or realism was lacking a bit. <br /> <br />Freezes: Best songs of the tour from different venus. (?) <br />Melbourne: Best entire concert of just one of the venues. <br /> <br />Hard to say which is better here, but each song seems to be better performed in Freezes Over.
0613206339|2.0|This is a great book, however if you are looking for a complete set of the HP books in hardcover this is not the version to buy.  This version has a very poorly made hard cover with no sleve and is much smaller then the hardcover version of the later books.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When Soundgarden disbanded in 1997, singer Chris Cornell ventured into his own side projects, but they were less than a success, so when Zach de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine three years later, Chris found himself a new home. The band adopted the name Audioslave when it came to them in a vision, and, after Chris left and rejoined the group, they released their debut album in 2002.<br /><br />It may be because I loved Rage so damn much, and I wanted Audioslave to pick up where Rage left off, but it took me several listens to warm up to this album. I actually fell asleep the first time I listened to it, and even though I was well rested when I listened to it the next few times, I was still very lukewarm on this C.D.. But, about a year after I gave up on it, and after Audioslave's sophomore album was released, I eventually gave this disc another try. When I did, I was blown away.<br /><br />Audioslave do not pick up where Rage Against the Machine left off; they are two completely different bands. This is mainly because, unlike Zach de la Rocha, Chris Cornell doesn't have a voice born to rap. If he tried it, it would probably be hilarious. Also, his voice isn't strong enough to yell over heavy rock, so Tom, Tim, and Brad have to play somewhat restrained. But, even though this C.D. is more alternative than anything Rage put out, it isn't 100% Soundgarden, either. It's a lot less grungy sounding, and guitarist Tom Morello can still wail, and he isn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />1. \\"Cochise\\" is the first single, a personal favorite of mine, and probably the heaviest song on the record. The first fifty seconds or so is a slow drum beat, but then the guitars go wild in typical Tom Morello fashion, while the bass omits a slow wah-wah sound, and Chris lets loose a few pretty big yells.<br />2. \\"Show Me How to Live\\" begins with a few riffs and a catchy drum beat, then the guitar riffs become faster and Chris makes some humming noises. The guitars make a beeping sound in the verses, but the choruses explode and both Tom and Chris wail.<br />3. \\"Gasoline\\" features a brief wall of guitar crunch at the beginning. Chris then proceeds to sing properly in the verses and, even though he raises his voice in the choruses, he doesn't ever yell. There's also a brief wah-wah guitar solo after one of the choruses.<br />4. \\"What You Are\\" has calm, restrained verses, making the riff heavy choruses kind of surprising.<br />5. \\"Like a Stone\\" has choruses which have moderately sized riffs, but the verses consist of a repetitive drum beat and light, spacey guitar plucking which almost sounds acoustic at times. Another guitar solo is thrown in here, as well.<br />6. \\"Set it Off\\" is a good choice for the fifth single. It has a weird, almost robotic guitar noise at the beginning and a really catchy chorus (where Chris yells \\"Set it off! Set this f-cker off!\\")<br />7. The first 45 seconds of \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" has light guitar strumming which almost sounds like a piano. The bass and drums kick eventually kick in before the chorus, where the guitars make a low buzzing noise. Chris' yells in the choruses are catchy, but his voice almost borders on whiney. This song seems restrained until the end, where it finally opens up and Tom gets to do his thing.<br />8. \\"I Am the Highway\\" has twinkling guitar noise and proper crooning. This song doesn't detonate like tracks 1-7 did, but it's not supposed to; this song is almost a semi-ballad. It's still catchy, though, thanks to the vocals.<br />9. \\"Exploder\\" sort of makes up for track eight's lack of riffs. I enjoy how Chris sings during this song's chorus, then the chorus suddenly begins and he yells over loud, downshifting riffs.<br />10.\\"Hypnotize\\" features beeping guitars which makes part of this song sound like a laser/light show.<br />11. \\"Bring `Em Back Alive\\" has light dwindling guitar notes, making this song sort of sound like the old RATM song \\"Born of a Broken Man.\\" The vocals in the verses are extended and sound like a vocal synthesizer, but the choruses are a lot louder, with big, stop-start riffs.<br />12. \\"Light My Way\\" is another restrained rocker, with wah-wah guitars and a low, rumbling bass. The choruses again jump in volume, when the crunchy, almost pounding riffs make an entrance.<br />13. \\"Getaway Car\\" has a great melody, with soft guitar notes and good singing (Chris sings the catchy line \\"Ooo-hoo.\\")<br />14. \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" is another sluggish song, with good melody. It has a slow, thumping drum beat and a guitar which sounds like a synthesizer.<br /><br />So, Chris joining forces with Tom, Tim and Brad was a big surprise, but it was an even bigger surprise that Audioslave's debut was so good. This album was an experiment, but the results were uncannily great. Audioslave might be the best alt metal band since Tool, and this is the best debut I've heard since Rage's 1992 self-titled album. I suggest this C.D. to fans of both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, as well as all fans of alt metal. And, as always, make sure you listen with an open mind.uses are a lot louder, with big, stop-start riffs.   12. \\"Light My Way\\" is another restrained rocker, with wah-wah guitars and a low, rumbling bass.

0446691437|4.0|I started reading this book and couldn't put it down - except for the fact that it prompted me to immediate action and I HAD to put it down.  The author identified such obvious truths that have gone undercover for way too long.  Now that they have been identified and named, they can be overcome and annihilated.  This is a 5 star book that I gave 4 stars only due to the sparse vulgar language that keeps it from being as universal as it should be.
B000065DWH|5.0|simply randy's best album along with sail way, my favs include \\"marie\\" and \\"guilty,\\" but every song is tops from this underated album.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|This CD s very good. Plant uses African beats like few other musicians. Last track, Brother Ray, is a \\"surprise\\" with nice beats... Robert Plant fans, this is a must.
0764113496|5.0|624 pages of necessary grammatical study: verbs in the perfective and imperfective aspects. Conjugated in the infinitive, presente, past, future and condicional tenses. <br />In english and cyrillic letterings !!! <br />With a page layout that is easy to find, read, memorize. <br />Really perfect for those who study the idiom in a serious way.
B0002IQHZM|4.0|This is some fine music from Donovan. I remember his early music with Gypsy Dave. This new album is no match, but it is a worthy contribution to the style and spiritual nature of blending style, spirit. and nature. If you have not heard it you can sample some songs. If you have not heard early Donovan, then you have no idea of what you missed.
B000059TEQ|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. If you are channel surfing and it is showing it is so easy to get sucked in no matter how many times you may have already seen it. The setting is Cambridge MA in the late 60's at Harvard University. The handsome and wealthy Oliver Barrett IV meets the brainy and beautiful but poor Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" Cavilleri at the library. Ali McGraw is so wonderful in this role as the sarcastic but endearing Jenny and Ryan O'Neal is perfect as the hockey playing jock/scion of an old New England family. This tender love story unfolds behind the ivy covered gates and the winter scenes and Francis Lai's soundtrack are exquisite. The movie takes you from undergrad, to law school, marriage and to the tearful conclusion without missing a beat. Ray Milland is brilliant as the snobby and class conscious Oliver Barrett III. A visually appealing movie that I highly recommend.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This a fantastic buy for blues fans and rock and rollers alike. There is some great guitar playing on this one. Even if it was just B.B. King, Clapton and Santana it would be well worth buying. But you also get some of the old school blues players as well as Z.Z. Top, a cameo by Joe Walsh, the guys who did the music for oh Brother where art thou and on and on. You won't be disappointed a two dvd set for a great price!!!    <br />
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Nice to see this film on DVD at last. Lee Marvin reunited with Angie Dickinson once again, having previously appeared together in The Killers (1964) and Point Blank (1967). Bronson's role is similar to the one he played in Chato's Land.
0345440900|5.0|This is a great book, expecially for new parents.  I used her E.A.S.Y. method with my daughter and she was sleeping through the night by three months.  She developed a wonderful sleep pattern and never fusses when put to bed.  Great advice, great shower gift.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Five stars for Buble and this cd.  <br />He's taken the greatness he showed in his first offering to us and raised it up a notch. It's Time is a celebration of songs sung by perhaps the most highly regarded male singer of our time. Critically acclaimed and beloved by millions of music fans around the world this cd is a testament to his vocal talent and the sensibilities he has regarding song choice and styling. A range of songs from slow to fast but all showcasing his rich and warm tones and sung with a passion that just demonstrates that Buble is worthy of such high praise. <br /> <br />Adding this cd to your playlist is a must and if the chance to see him perform ever comes your way ----- take it! His show in Houston was our second, and like his cds, he just gets better and better AND better.
B0009NSE1K|3.0|Still rockin', but not as ballsy as the last album. Less metallic more funky. Save it for a rainy day purchase. I'll still continue to buy anything Clutch puts out. Check out neil fallon on the mastadon album 'leviathan'. That F-ING RAWKS!
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|This is a good dvd for Eagles fans. It is an acoustic version of thier greatest hits. The photography is crisp and clear and the sound is very clean. Joe Walsh is clean shaven and his hair is short so this must have been the Corporate tour or something. I love electric guitars but this dvd is still well worth investing your hard earned dollars in. It looks great on a big screen T.V. the group is very well polished to not have toured together in ages.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I will admit I am late on the Arcade Fire bandwagon.  I learned about the band via word of mouth and decided to give Funeral a shot.  After listening to the album one time through, I did not listen to it again for a while.  The album just did not make an impression on me first time.  Another friend told me to give it a second chance and I am glad I took the advice.  Funeral is an exceptional album.  It is one of those records that will hold up after repeated listens.<br /><br />There is not a bad song on the album.  My personal favorite is \\"Wake Up.\\"  The song has a great change 2/3rds through.  I have never been a particular fan of Modest Mouse, but the Arcade Fire definitely share some similarities.  Fortunately, the Arcade Fire magnifies everything I like about Modest Mouse.  Comparisons aside, Funeral has its own distinct sound.  The only disappointment I have is that I did not get this album sooner.  The Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" is a great record and hopefully we will hear a lot more from the Montr&eacute;al based band in the future.
B000000HTM|5.0|It's a huge thrill for an old time fan like me to see so many still discovering and attuning to this absolutely unique and powerful relic of the prog-rock era.  No, not everyone can get on Van Der Graaf's singular wavelength, but as the prior reviews attest, those of us who can find something in Van Der Graaf, and in Pawn Hearts in particular that no other band can match.<br /><br />I agree that this may not be the best \\"starter\\" album for someone new to Van Der Graaf.  For that I would recommend \\"The Least we Can Do...\\" which features (among other things) the beautiful by any standard \\"Refugees\\" as well as the opening track, \\"Darkness 11/11\\" (Peter Hammill's birthday, by the way), an excellent 6-minute precis of what the band is all about.<br /><br />Even if you find \\"The Least we Can Do\\" tantalizing, \\"Pawn Hearts\\" may still not work for you.  It is indeed jagged, raw, dissonant and jarring.  You may not like it at all at first; stick with it--in time it will reveal itself as one of the most profound rock albums EVER--I agree totally with a previous reviewer's ranking in the all-time prog top 10.  This is a work of intense depth and perception, and Hamill's lyrics & songwriting are in absolutely top form.  I especially want to express my own fierce admiration for \\"Man-Erg\\"-musically, lyrically and emotively one of the most powerful cries of existential pondering ever!  The stately vocal/piano intro \\"falls off the cliff\\" into an inferno of blasting staccato sax, to be overlaid with Hammill's throat-ripping screams, \\"how can I be free?  How can I get help?  Am I really me?  Am I someone else?\\"  This section yields to a less urgent midsection highlighting Banton's organ, Peter's less frantic but no less intense wordplay, concluding with some beautifully melodious saxaphone flourishes by Dave Jackson (with restrained ornamental riffing by that Fripp guy on electric guitar).  All of which eases us back to an even more dignified restatement of the opening verse, this time opened up on the back end to another berserk crescendo of voice and band jacking it up to 11 for a thunderous close.  Lyrically, it's all about exploring the nature of the human condition--\\"A killer lives inside me, I can feel him move...\\"  It's all subjective of course, but to my ears no one has ever captured the riddle of living so succinctly as Peter Hammill did in this song.  Does it provide answers?  No, of course not--but in the act of articulating a sense of humanity I'd never felt captured before, Hammill surely enriched my life in a way that still moves me.  This is not just a pop song, it's art.<br /><br />I too lament the absence of \\"Theme One\\" from all CD editions of this recording.  This was one of the few times the American LP was better than the import--the US version dropped \\"Theme One\\" between track 1 (Lemmings) and track 2 (Man-Erg), and gave the whole album a shot in the arm.  Yes, it was written by the Beatles' George Martin, but it's a kick-ass instrumental number with sinew & muscle to spare.  The band really shows some swagger that very few of Hammill's compositions allowed (well, perhaps until \\"Godbluff,\\" anyway).  I should also briefly mention that another \\"little\\" song, the INCREDIBLE song \\"W\\" was also recorded at this time, and we can only hope that some future CD reissue will gather all these tracks in one package.<br /><br />\\"Pawn Hearts\\" may never find a wide audience, but those of us \\"on the inside\\" recognize just what a pinnacle it is.  The word \\"Masterpiece\\" has been debased badly by overuse, but I can think of no better title to bestow.  Five supernova stars.his time opened up on the back end to another berserk crescendo of voice and band jacking it up to 11 for a thunderous close.

B0007M22TI|4.0|This video is for those lovers of Celtic music and beautiful, talented women.  It is entertaining and conforms to the Celtic tradition.
B000089RVX|1.0|So I gave this a shot, against my wishes (didn't have much hope for them in the first place) and boy, was I right.  All I see in Evanescence is a rip off of so many other bands from before their time.  Its unoriginal, uninspired, crap.  Amy Lee has a nice voice, and thats where it ends.. it seems that the music was created to appeal to a particular type of listener, instead of created by themselves, for themselves (something that most good bands do).<br /><br />If you liked this album, or any of their other albums, I suggest to try listening to something new.  Check out Sirenia, Nightwish, and Lacuna Coil.  If you like female vocals, in these bands is where the true talent lies.  They make music for themsleves, and its more beautiful, than any crap that Amy Lee could concive of.
B000089RVR|1.0|Quite what we did to deserve Dido is anyone's guess, but she certainly doesn't seem to be going anywhere, as housewives everywhere flock to buy every dull, inoffensive dirge she spews out.<br /><br />What is this record like? I'd compare it to gruel, the slop served in Oliver.  Or grey wallpaper in an old classroom. Or that brown wrapping paper you put parcels in. Bland, boring and very, very tedious. Perfect for a suicide attempt, but would you really want Dido to be the last thing you'd ever hear?<br /><br />Exactly. No point buying this, then. Move along.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk

0671027387|2.0|I first read Angels and Demons. I could not have loved a book more! Then I read Digital Fortress and I wanted to start working for the NSA. After that I read Da Vinci Code. It was quite a good book. But lots of things were kind of predictable. I would still give it 4 stars. Then I bought Deception point. I read through it. I found it to be too predictable and too Dan \\"Browny\\". All the typical stuff. Last minute saves, things fall into place for the hero and the heroine. Same old stuff. I still give it 2 stars out of respect to Dan Brown for doing an excellent job on the other three. If you are a Dan Brown fan, i recommend you start reading the book without any expectations.<br /><br />I tend to believe that if this is your first Dan Brown book, you will enjoy the ride.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Rita Hayworth is at her sultry best in a role that was made for her in Charles Vidor's 1946 film noir classic \\"Gilda\\".<br /><br />Glenn Ford playing gambler Johnny Farrell has a chance encounter with arrogant Buenos Aires casino owner Ballin Mundson played by scar faced George Macready.  Ford eventually gains his trust and is charged with running the casino.  Macready returns from a business trip and much to Ford's surprise reveals his new wife and party girl, Gilda.  Little did the intensely jealous Macready know that Ford and Hayworth had been lovers and still had feelings for each other.  And so began a rather sticky and tortuous love triangle, although with Ford being respectful and keeping his distance.<br /><br />We later find out that Macready's business extends quite a bit further than gambling.  He is the head of a cartel controlling the metal, tungsten.  He apparently acquired this from German sources during the war and they wished to reclaim it.<br /><br />The story proceeds with suspense and some torrid scenes featuring Hayworth performing provocative song and dance routines.  The Argentine police are aware of what is transpiring and a sympathetic detective Obregon played by Maltese born Joseph Calleia assures that the story has a satisfying ending.<br /><br />Director Vidor does a nice job in showcasing Hayworth who turned this role into a signature piece of her acting ability.  Ford and Macready do very well in their roles but Hayworth lights up the screen with her presence.  The plot while not overly dramatic does enough to plausibly tie the action together.
0975991477|4.0|To be honest I am only half way through the book. But so far I am finding the inforamtion valuable. And interesting that he shares the juxtapostion of his academic life with his personal life.<br /><br />I am reluctant to put this in as of not having completed the book, but I will say I am itching to finish it as it has grabbed my attention from the first pages.<br /><br />I am not an academic by any means but I don't feel inhibited by that at all in regards to this book. User friendly....
B000A1ENCU|4.0|Though I agree this is a great movie due for DVD release, it can't be anamorphic widescreen as it came out in 1951, two years before \\"Widescreen\\" movies debuted  (excepting early experiments like 1927's Napoleon or 1930's Big Trail with John Wayne).
B00080ZG1A|3.0|Leonardo DiCaprio did not make the proper lead for this film. <br />I was very disapointed.
B00004U8JV|3.0|This installment in Jurassic Park is dinosaur overkill, and a little comedic, the T-Rex running through the streets as Japanese people run away...But, it's entertaining, and a must to buy if you're a Jurassic Park fan. It's the same with Indiana Jones, the second movie was lacking, but if you're a fan, you end up buying the box set, and watch it anyway along with the other two...Still a good film, albeit a little over the top and silly...
0316172324|2.0|Blink is worth the read, but only for the paper back price. It's very easy to follow and a quick page-turner. However, it's a bit shallow. <br /> <br />Blink's basic premises is: intuition is real, it's been scientifically proven, and you too can learn to use it. Most people feel there is something more to the \\"gut feel\\" or the \\"intuition\\" a person has. This show's that's true. The proof's Gladwell outlines are fascinating but the point is made too many times. However, I was disappointed to finish the book and not learn anything about honing one's own Thin Slicing capabilities.  <br /> <br />Read Blink, but borrow it from a friend or buy the paperback used.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|All these \\"Priest fans\\" who give this album bad reviews, I just wanna say that you suck, and should not be considered a Priest fan, or in that case be taken seriously.  This album is just as good, if not better, then Painkiller, British Steel, SFV and DOTF!  Anyone who dares to call themselves Priest fans, yet chooses to put this album down, should be stripped of their Defender badges!!  This album has it all for Piest lovers!  \\"Angel\\", which is sounds like \\"Before The Dawn\\", \\"Hellrider\\" which sounds like something form the Painkiller album, \\"Eulogy\\" which is like SWOD's \\"Epitaph\\", Judas is rising\\" which is sonds like \\"Freewheel Burning\\" and \\"Between The Hammer And The Anvil\\".  This album is great, pick it up if you don't have it already, buy 2 copies, one of each to help get true metal bands into gold status again.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|OK, I do! It is enough that she is incredibly gorgeous and seems level-headed and intelligent on top if it...but a talented musician and singer??? Geez, a mortal woman can only handle so much. <br /> <br /> <br />OK, look, she ain't no Mozart style genius but she has a beautiful voice and genuine emotion and...sorry, she is great! Am a fan (if a jealous disgruntled achiever one...)

1400032717|5.0|If you read this book with the expectation that it won't be written like most of the other books you've read, you will like it much more.  It is written from the point of view of a teenage boy with a form of autism.  There are stereotypes present in this book.  That is probably because most people's knowledge of autism and Asperger's syndrome is limited.  Give it a try.  I liked it, but if it's not what you're looking for find something else to read.
B000053V7Q|5.0|He is absolutely the best at what he does.  This dvd doesn't have the interviews of the video version, which is fine it gives more time to see him in action being candid and doing the rehearsals. This dvd gives you the chance to see Elvis fooling around and just being himself.  Would recommend this dvd to everyone young and old doesn't matter.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This has been one of my fav. movies since it came out.  The wonderful story would make anyone seem good, but Tom Hanks kicks it right threw the uprights with his wonderful, talented turn as the title character.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great, awesome, spectacular! Joss Whedon really is a genius. I watched every episode while the series lasted on TV, but I didn't remember how inspired it was. Watching them again is sheer joy, plus the DVD has three unaired episodes. What a treat. Can't wait for the movie this fall!
0800177177|5.0|Gary Oldman is so deliciously sexy in this movie it is hard to turn away from it.  Anthony Hopkins and Winona Ryder are also excellent in this movie.  I agree with all other reviewers, the weakness in this movie is the choice of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. Terrible Choice!  This movie is visually stunning and keeps you spellbound from start to finish. Tom Waits is amazing as the deranged Renfield.  One of the best Dracula movies I have ever seen.  Sadie Frost performance is superb as  she goes from sweet ingenue to Dracula's sexy concubine.
B000002LAB|5.0|This is a great jazz record. Sure its more poppy than his earlier stuff but he was just trying to be heard by that generation. This record has won many awards and has been sampled by many people. I like all the songs on this, but my favorites include Tutu, Portia, Backyard Ritual, Don't Lose Your Mind, and Full Nelson. I recommend this to anyone who loves music.
B00005UW9T|4.0|This is definitely one of the better recent animated major-studio films.  In fact, I personally liked it better than many recent efforts by rival Disney.  The story of the young girl trying to find herself, an innocent victim of history, is beautifully told, with a great cast of voices.  Maybe not as great as it could be, but the haunting song \\"Once upon a December\\" alone is worth the price of the disc.  PARENTS NOTE: Although this movie is rated \\"G\\", I would not recommend it for young children; the character of the undead Rasputin is quite intense and scary.
0975991477|5.0|Excellent scientific explanation of quantum physics, biology and how our beliefs alter our physiology.  Does get a little scientific for the average layperson but overall excellent.  This book provides the basis for the miserable failure of our current medical system as allopathic medicine is based on Newtonian physics and therefore a chemical(drug) approach to disease.  This book opens the door to the future of healthcare and is years ahead of its time.
B00004HYLF|5.0|I have the original album - vinyl. It is the most unusual awesome sound of jazz, funk and big fusion rock!! <br />Good vibrations and sounds!! <br />A thought of prominence and evolution to the new presences of expressions that would transpire to a new age of an enlightened few! <br />The soulfulness of a new jazz to the sounds of a future of fusion cooled. <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|All the energy and brillance of the live performance! Defying Gravity was uplifting and empowering, Popular is funny, perky and clever! Loved it! My daughter has memorized all the words to all the songs.
B0002OERI0|1.0|ok...let me say wow, ok now this sucks, its not actual expression, or art. what it is is an attempt to cash in on the i hate bush frenzy right now, cuz theyve never done anything political before to my knowledge, but then at the height of this its so cool to hate bush time, ha ha i dont know why i hate him but man he sure is stupid blah blah blah im a stupid little ignorant kid. Bottom line is that the political lyrics are bull****, the music isnt the least bit origianal or interesting, and i dont think they just got bad cuz i dont think they were ever that good. If its political *punk* that u want, then get informed on bushes policies and check out some anti-flag, strike anywhere, bad religion, or (off topic) get Mars Volta-Frances the mute or At the Drive-in. all those bands blow this away, musically, lyrically,everything. and the list price on their cds isnt $19.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens is easily the best in the whole quadrilogy. It has some of the suspense and horror from the original mixed in with loads of action.All which add up to be a great movie. Sigourney Weaver deserved an oscar for her wonderful reprise as Ripley. And Carrie Henn,Newt,acted amazing for a child her age and melted the audience's hearts in the process.If you enjoyed Alien, and love a good action movie, Aliens is for you.
B000002B5L|1.0|I dont know what this \\"Wayne Maye\\" Guy is talking about but the fugees are far from a \\"monumental\\" Group. Its a surprise to me that this is even considered Hip-Hop. 1 catchy radio single sells alot of records as the fugees and many others have shown but I wouldnt even consider their name when thinking of a influential or even a player in the game of music. Obviously Wayne doesnt know ANYTHING about music or he wouldnt have commented that \\"Nas reigned supreme\\". Are U kidding me? Nas? Thats a horrible joke I hope many eyes and ears dont have to hear or see. Giving credit to Nas, some (and I mean very few) of his songs are alright, but I wouldnt even say his name when asked who I thought did anything for rap. The Fugees can make good noise together and sing in harmony but Its far from what I would consider \\"monumental\\" much less mediocre.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This CD is super awesome and really kicks ass!  Any Foo fan should purchase this!
B0000CBHOI|5.0|Five stars is just not enough.  This collection is a MUST HAVE forn all blues fans and, in my opinion, should be mandatory study for every student of music.
B00012FXB8|1.0|This is the worst of the four. If they hadn't killed off the three wonderful characters introduced in Aliens it might have been an ok movie. But no, they make their ship crash on this planet of \\"celebate\\" prisoners and make Ripley the only survivor. And then, we get to watch as they slice open Newt's chest to see if there's a chestburster inside. And the rest isn't even worth talking about. I was really disappointed with this movie and you will be too. Rent it(if you must)first before you buy it.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This horror film is a classic. No doubt about it. It may not be my fave horror film like Elm Street, An American Werewolf In London or the Thing, but it's still a classic. Apparently there is an Extended Edition on Anchor Bay DVD, in fact there IS an Extended Edition on Anchor Bay DVD, because i have it. (It goes for 104 mins) The music score is an instant classic movie score too, not relying on Symphonys or anything else, just John Carpenter's brilliant mind of making an unforgettable score on just a synthisizer. Donald Pleasance will be remembered mostly by horror fans as the brilliant (& never giving up) Dr. Loomis, who is the only one who thinks Michael Myers is heading back to Haddenfield to kill again. All in all, one of the best horror films in movie history. A true horror gem.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|OH MY GOSH! Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason is 10 times funnier than than the first one!! I just couldn't stop laughing ! It's soooooo funny! I almost laughed EVERY 5-10 minutes! It's fabulous! U should NEVER miss this film!!
B000058BGZ|5.0|I have heard many recorded and live performances of the Berg Sonata, but this is the first which, in my opinion, gives us what Berg intended.  The sonata is underrated by many, who clearly have not studied it carefully or listened to it repeatedly. It not to be merely knocked off,as with so many performers(e.g.,Perahia, Aimard, Gould, Nin An, et al.). Berg's score is richly detailed with clues to his intentions which,  when followed (as here), result in an illuminating and accessible performance. And only an elitist would quarrel with accessibility. The artist's accuracy, particularly in the difficult development section (usually muddied up by others), and her sensitive interpretation throughout, make this the choice of the litter.  <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|Everyone raved about this cd, and it certainly got plenty of publicity -- particularly about the cover art, but apart from a couple of songs, I wasn't overly impressed with this cd.  A lot of the songs sound virtually identical. <br /> <br />If you really like specific songs (noise, fix you), buy the songs online and download them to your MP3.  Don't waste your money on the whole cd.
B000000W5L|4.0|The Rolling Stones, led by Mick Jagger have been playing for 40 years. This was one of their better albums over that period. Turd on the run, loving cup rocks off and other great songs were on this album. I don't think i need to write a long review for this album. A must buy to add to your stones collection.
B00005OAA6|2.0|This album is not very good, i gotta say... I just don't really like it... The only 2 songs that i think it's OKAY are \\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\" and \\"Mind Of Its Own\\", the others are not very good. I don't even listen to this album that often... Kinda wasting money.... If you are willing to buy this album, why not buy Emma Bunton's album? She's also one of the Spice Girls and her album rocks!!
B00003CXD5|4.0|We have nametags/badges where we work. Occasionally someone forgets to wear it. When admonished by the managers, the phrase, \\"Badges? Badges?? We don't need no stinkin' badges\\", is usually the response. Curious about the origin of that phrase, I purchased the Treasure of the Sierra Madre just for the context.  <br /> <br />The movie is dated, but still worth watching. It was surprising to see Humphrey Bogart not be the hero. The ironic ending was also a big surprise to me. The movie resolves itself in a fitting manner. I would have to say that I'm glad I got it. By the way, the actor with the \\"badge\\" line was really quite good. <br /> <br />Paul <br />Somewhere in northern Illinois

B000063T0T|5.0|Moulin Rouge already is a very very very good film, and so do the music in it! Moulin Rouge Collector's Edition include all songs in the movie! Including the killer track, Lady Marmalade and Come What May. This album is totally fabulous!  <br />
0783233477|5.0|While it isn't a perfect movie, it's the most stunning portrayal (by Claire Forlani) of the Divine Feminine I've ever seen.  Goose bump material.  The thing is, because it shows a feminine version of real power, most people look right past it and don't see it.  Bless this actress for not doing it like a male would.  Anthony Hopkins is his usual wonderful self - i.e., you never feel like you're watching Anthony Hopkins, just the character.  Brad Pitt does okay at what must have been a very awkward role.  But Claire Forlani's character. . . have your women friends watch it, have your men friends watch it.  Then watch how many people don't see it, don't see the immensity or the courage, and think she's weak. That's the Feminine - the part you don't see.  I consider it a real contribution to our culture.
B0009H1CKG|1.0|Wow....remember how you'd watch your favorite sports idol in their prime? Just simply dominating their chosen sport( Ali in boxing, Jordan in basketball, Yankees in the mid 90's to 2000).We all couldn't picture our heroes becoming a shell or parody of themseleves, hoping they would go out on top(Mash, Seinfeld). Well, i used to be the BIGGEST P. Funk fan. During the 70's i felt no band could touch them. Be it Rock, Funk or Soul. They just destroyed the competition. <br />   After viewing this sad DVD, all I could say is..\\"You have to know when to hang up da gloves\\" These guys were just going through the motions. Many of the band members( The older members) looked like they just stepped out of bed 15 minutes before the show. The vocals and musicianship were so sloppy! These guys really looked like they experimented with every known drug and it finally caught up to them. Every song and lazy drum beat had a BPM of around 86bpm. Valiums for everybody!!!!! Avoid this trainwreck and look for a P. Funk concert in the mid-70's. You'll love the energy, solos, genius, and wackiness.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|One of the most satisfying CDs I've purchased in years.  Stunning arrangements, great selection.  I've given this CD to several people as a gift.  They all loved it.
0399241515|4.0|Man, I didn't see that coming. Horowitz may pull out some kind of save in Ark Angel, but it looks like Alex Rider has run out of luck. Great book, read it if you have read the rest of the series. Astounding ending.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Excellent video and audio quality. For a middle of the road Eagles fan, this DVD was a turning point. I am hooked. <br />
B00005JKG9|4.0|Most probally know that this movie started out as a play. It is apparent with the abundance of dialogue. Al Pacino is such a great character in this movie and Alec Baldwin cleary steals the movie in one scene. His classic lines are quoted amongst sales professionals throughout the world.  <br />ABC baby! Great movie, ending kind of stinks. Its too abrupt, but the Alec Baldwin scene is worth the price of admission on its own.
B00005LB9O|4.0|While not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music: melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song'. <br /> <br />If you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent, then I confidently recommend The Invisible Band to you.  <br /> <br />Rating each song individually for one's ipod:  <br />1. Sing, Side, The Cage, Afterglow and the Humpty Dumpty Love Song are each worthy of four to five stars <br />2. Pipe Dreams, Flowers in the Window, Safe, Follow the Light, and Indefinitely are three to four star songs <br />3. The balance are two to three stars each. The only poor effort is probably \\"Last Train\\", which is too plodding relative to its counterparts <br /> <br />The Invisible Band is basically a healthy mix of folksy, hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy. Nowhere is this better reflected than in 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song', which defines this mix perfectly. While this is the best of the album, the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly.  Highly recommended.
1573223085|5.0|People change out of inspiration or desperation. Occasionally the two meet in a well-written, provocative, and helpful book like A Whole New Mind.<br /><br />On the desperation side of the equation, author Dan Pink points the reader to more than a few disturbing facts. First, is the peril of abundance. Why would the abundance of our society threaten my job? After the author explains how companies are building brands on great design and experiential savvy (think<br /><br />Target) along with what respected leaders say they value going forward (think GM's Robert Lutz), you quickly get the picture.<br /><br />Next, Pink introduces the reader as to where routine, white-collar work is increasingly being done in large amounts; for less than large amounts of dollars. Hint: It starts with an \\"A\\" but it isn't America. Asia is now becoming the center where knowledge workers are hired in large numbers to serve the companies of our North American economy.<br /><br />Another dark cloud of painful reality comes when Pink looks at the friendly computer on your desk. Our generation of white-collar workers will join the previous generation of blue-collar workers as together they lament the power of Automation. It will take more than brawn or brains to find a job when computers do for free what today's professionals do for fees.<br /><br />The research is there. Pink's argument is well documented without altering the real value and purpose of the book: to inspire change in today's worker and business leader.<br /><br />Inspiration for meaningful change is the greatest strength of A Whole New Mind. It is full of meaningful action and applications any reader can implement. For me, this is what makes it such joy and a must read for anyone I care about!<br /><br />Pink has identified six aptitudes/concepts for what he calls the Conceptual Age: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning. He has not only illustrated them, but also included what the reader can do to acquire these skills. Why? - Because with them you grow your value as employees. Without them you lose your competitive edge. It is that simple.<br /><br />A Whole New Mind strikes just the right balance. The dark truth is revealed in sufficient quantities to get you moving, and an inspiring future, along with \\"first steps\\", is supplied in order to keep you moving!these skills.

B000002I6V|5.0|I'm convinced that Graham Nash had the best voice of Crosby Stills & Nash, even Young!<br /><br />This is a great mix of old 70's toons that is part ballad, part rock and part war protest!<br /><br />Now that I can't wear out my CD like I did my LP, and I have ripped it to my I-tunes and I-pod, it will get a LOT of listening!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Good selection of musics and a great version of \\"All You Need Is Love\\"!!
B00005UW9T|5.0|I don't care how unaccurate this film is. I just care that it is a great movie to watch. I love the characters, the animation is spectacular, and the songs are unforgettable! I always believed in the stories of Anastasia, but I was sad when I learned the truth about her and her family. If this movie was real, it would really convince me that Anastasia would be a true princess.  <br /> <br />The story begins in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1916, as a ball is being held in honor of the 300th anniversary of the ruling of the czars of Russia. One of the guests is the Dowager Emperess Marie (Angela Lansbury, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Murder, She Wrote, Beauty and the Beast), who loves her youngest granddaughter, Anastasia (Kirsten Dunst, Jumanji, Mona Lisa Smile, Spiderman). The emperess is leaving for Paris, which makes Anastasia sad. So, the emperess gives her granddaughter a music box to remember her by, as well as a necklace that reads \\"Together in Paris\\". The party is interuppted when Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd, Angels in the Outfield, Taxi; sung by Jim Cummings, the voice of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger), an evil holy man, sends a curse upon the Romanov family that they will die within the night. After the party, the revolution begins, and the Romanovs are trying to escape. Anastasia forgets her music box and runs off to her room, with her grandmother running close behind her. Suddenly, the protesters burst into the castle! A small servant boy helps the princess and the grandmother into a special door hidden in the wall so that they could escape. Rasputin meets the two on the ice, where he is sure that Anastasia could not escape. But then, the ice breaks, and Rasputin drowns to his death. By the time Anastasia and Marie get to the train station, the train is already leaving! Marie gets on, but Anastasia is running as fast as she can so she could get on, too. Marie grabs onto her granddaughter's hand, but it slips from her grasp, and Anastasia falls. Since then, Mariehas been searching for granddaughter, but all she finds are frauds. Can she ever see her granddaughter again? <br /> <br />10 years have passed since the revolution, and a rumor has been started that Anastasia is alive, and the Dowager Empress Marie is offering 10 million rubles to anyone who can bring Anastasia to her. Two men, Dmitri (John Cusack, Must Love Dogs, America's Sweethearts) and Vladmir (Kelsey Grammar, Frasier, Cheers) are willing to take that chance, but only for the money since they are con men, or those who use fake people to pretend they are a real person. Meanwhile, at an orphanage, an 18 year old girl named Anya (Meg Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail) is sent off to go get a job at the fish factory. She has no memory of her past, except a necklace that reads \\"Together in Paris\\". She can't shake off the feeling that she may be someone special. Anya doesn't know what to do. Then, a little encouragement from a stray dog leads her to St. Petersburg, where she decides to get a ticket to go to Paris. But she has no exit visa, which she can't get a ticket. So then, she goes off to the old palace to seek out a man named Dmitri. While exploring the palace, she imagines herself at a ball, dancing in the arms of those who love her, feeling safe and warm. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Dmitri and Vladmir appears. As Anya tries to run away, but is stopped by Dmitri, who looks at her while standing at the painting of the Russian family. She looks a lot like Anastasia. Anya tells her story to the two men, who want to help her get to Paris, but the third ticket is reserved for Anastasia. Then, they try to convince her that she could be the princess. Anya catches on, and agrees to go with them. But, unknowingly, a bat named Bartok (Hank Azaria, The Simpsons, Bartok the Magnificent) watches from above, and realizes that Anastasia is alive. The reliquary, which belonged to Rasputin, plunges down to the underworld, taking Bartok with it. When he tells Rasputinthat Anastasia is alive, he is enraged and vows to kill the remaining member of the Romanov family. Will Rasputin get his revenge? Is Anya really Anastasia? And what will Dmitri and Vladmir do if they get the rubles? <br /> <br />This movie is fantastic. I loved every minute of it, except the part where Anastasia learns that Dmitri is a con man. The songs are simply lovely. I love Aaliyah's version of \\"Journey to the Past\\". She did a great job. I'm sorry to see her go unexpectedly. I also liked \\"At the Beginning\\" by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis. And a big shout-out to the composers. They rock!  <br /> <br />It doesn't matter if this movie is historically correct or not. It matters that you learn a big lesson from it. A couple, actually. The main lesson is follow your heart. It will guide you to your true heart's desires. Buy Anastasia today! The special features of this DVD are good, too. It's a real journey to the past!
B00023BLXK|5.0|Another great movie thats worth watching. Great love story of people from different worlds coming together with one common ground - Dancing! The movie is fresh with the gorgeous scenes and backdrops of the beautiful city of Havanna, Cuba in the 50's. Definitly worth watching again. I recommend it!
B00005MP58|5.0|Very good!  This movie follows the novel almost to the tee, and is really good at depicting the characters.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is the best batman movie ever, its how it should be. I thought this one was a classic, added to the first 2 films. (Chirstian Bale) did great! (Michael Caine) did a great Alfred as well as the last one. (Katie Holmes) did a nice job as Bruce Waynes close friend and love interest. There was something about her that reminded me of (Kim Basinger) from the first movie.   The villains were awsome, (Cillian Murphy) he did a termentious job as Scarrcrow, he was my favorite. He played the guy like a normal person but with a twisted way that you knew he was crazy. Thats how the bad guys should be, not cheesey like in the last batman movie, with (George Cloony)and (Arnold Schwarzenegger)as Mr. Freeze give me a break. Batgirl played by (Alica Sliverstone) was one hot chick, but her acting was terrible and she was way too stiff when fighting, and she did not have much of a big part in that last film. Posion Ivy was great, she was the only one who did a great job, while everyone else went down with the Titanic because of the  ice burg (Schwarzenegger) built with his stupid gient freezing gun made from a teleiscope and with dimonds he stole from an over sized jewler. (Uma Thurman) known as the plant lady. She was the only survivor left, that did not hit Arnold's Ice burg. The last movie was a horror, I  don't know why (Tim Burton) did not direct the last 2 films? I don't get it why (Joel Schumacher), had to finish the last 2 batman movies ??? Thank God (Jim carrey) as the Riddler was there to rescuse the 3rd movie. If it was not for him, it could have been much worse.  (Tommy Lee Jones) as Two-Face did not do that bad,I give him some created for taking on a crazy role.  For the last movie , I could see (Jack Nicholson) lauhing his ass off, so hard cuz that last one was a real big time joke. (Micheal Keaton) would have said , what the hell are they doing, if I would have stayed with the contract things probibly would have been better.  The other villians in Batman Returns (Danny DeVito)as the Penguin and (Michelle Pfeiffer) as Catwoman oh ya baby! Were a bad ass kicking team.  I liked the new car, in Batman Begins but I wish they could have made it alittle fancier,like in the first movie, but don't worry, this one is going to maybe lead to a sequal??? I hope. I know they are going to do the whole series over, which is good, they better stay with the same tone and Gothic style as the original movie.  I did also here they are going to do the all the villians over from scratch.  I wish the other cast member would return to do over there parts, everyone except (Arnold Schwarzeneger). (Chris O'Donnell) did a great Robin, for his first apearance in Batman Forever, but for his second time around in the last one, oh boy, did they turn him into a real spoiled brat and like a smart ass know it all. Let me say one thing, he was obesseded over poison Ivy like she was a real hot stuff and thought he was really in love with her but mostly likely wanted to kill him duh. As like most high schoolers today. Little did he listen to batman as a best freind or a big brother to seek help like most teenagers today in some relationships over girl/boy stuff and stupid things not like oh I know about trust someone. I know the true meaning of  love and all that  lecturing crap. How to become the bad boy on campus. They made that movie so bad, it does not go well with the last 3 movies.  Batman Begins is 100 times better, most of all it true to the Comic book story the way they should have made it a long time ago. The comic book verison is darker and more fast pace and enjoyable and  go to show you his true Origins, how he came to  to be who is he as a famous icon of all time. This movie is not some screen play or writen up story.  I gave this one 5 stars because its how batman has Returned, not only that but how he will remain  a LEGEND Forever!!!  Go see this, trust me, its a whole new Gotham, with a new all star cast with a new set of wings !!!! Then you will be walking out of the theartre saying HOLLY RUSTED MEDAL BATMAN!!! OR WAIT TILL THEY GET ALOAD OF HIM...
B000001FS3|5.0|I remember the first time I listened to this album, I was amazed at what I was hearing. The bundle \\"Where the streets have no name-I still haven't found-With or Without You\\" is still unmatched and it's just the beginning of one of the three masterpieces that U2 has released. <br /> <br />In eleven songs Bono & co. somehow manage to include all the topics that have been a constant in U2's career: Hope, spirituality, love, politics, et al. <br /> <br />Still today the first three songs are the most anticipated songs in every U2 concert, being \\"Where the streets have no name\\" everyone's favourite.  <br /> <br />But this album has more to offer: Mothers of the disappeared is one of the most underated songs of U2; Running to stand still is a sad little song, and so on you will find something to relate in every single piece of this album. <br /> <br />It may not be the best album of U2 from a technical standpoint  (I think that place belongs to Actung Baby), but definitely this one has more heart and soul than any other U2 record. If you haven't heard it, what are you waiting for?.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This collection is my ultimate favorite greatest hits album. It captures every bit of Blondie's style that changed the sound of rock. She made punk rock cool before it was popular. All of the songs on this album are a must for any rock music fan!!!
0790729628|5.0|This oldie can hold up to all that have come after it.  In fact, many try to emulate it in numerous ways.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is tight and Late registration will be also. But this is not Kayne's first cd. He had an underground cd in Chi-Town called The High School Graduate.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Released the year I was born, this film has been with me all my life.   <br /> <br />The story is brilliant, the puppetry spectacular, and David Bowie plays perfectly the dark character of the Goblin King Jareth. <br /> <br />I recomend this film to all lovers of fantasy, young and old.  It truly deserves its cult status, and with any luck a collectors edition will be out soon. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this program when it was on T.V. even though it was undeservedly short-lived. This DVD series is even better (no commercials) especially with the upcoming \\"Serenity\\" movie. Buying the complete series gave me a chance to re-fresh my memory. This is a must buy!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Faceless is my first taste of Godsmack, and I have to say, I love everything on this cd. I don't understand all the bad rap about this disc. No, I haven't listened to the previous Godsmack cd's yet, but if you like hard- hitting, can't sit still, in your face rock then you should love this disc. Yea, a few of the intros sound the same, but this cd rocks hard, just how I like it. And Sully Erna's voice, damn, he makes me want to @$#%$%. Anyway, I love it, I could give a flying f*** if it sounds the same, it delivers.  I don't like soft or mellow rock, boring. I like it heavy, to hit hard, and be little bit dangerous. Faceless satisfies my heavy hitting rock hunger. I can't wait for the next Godsmack masterpiece.
B00080EU58|5.0|I love this Cd!! It has the Vol. 3 Subliminal versus disc 1, and on disc 2 it has 2 songs that were supposed to be on the cd but nver made it, a remix of Vermillion, A full length version of Danger-Keep away, The Blister Exists live in stockholm,Three Nil live,Disasterpiece live in London, and People (...) live in Chicago! Nobody listen to that  D.J cornwell or what's his face. Backstreet boys are for 5 year old girls who think care bears are cool and think nothing is wrong in the world...Wrong! Slipknot doesn't let you wallow in your troublesthey let you release that negative energy through music. If you're a true slipknot fan get this cd!
0451169514|3.0|Stephen King's novel 'It' is a book that in my opinion does not live up to its purpose.  While the narrative is enjoyable, it takes far too long to get anywhere, and tells the same story from far too many perspectives. <br /> <br />It is not terribly frightening (I find it hard to feel any fear at a clown called Pennywise who turns into mummies and warewolves), and the writing is not concise enough.  It becomes an irritating read because you keep expecting the plot to move along, and it doesn't. <br /> <br />I can understand why this book has had such little commercial success, as it is far too long to be the kind of book to just pick up to pass the time.  And the length I found to be completely unnecessary.  The story could have been told, perhaps even more effectively, in half the words. <br /> <br />That is not to say that this book isn't enjoyable.  It is a fun read, if you can get past the dragging first half of the book.  When the seven return to Derry, the novel really picks up, and the narrative finally gains some sort of flow, even becomes a little alarming in places. <br /> <br />It is by no means a terrible book, but in no way is it a literary masterpiece.  I recomend this for a bit of light reading, for the reader who has a lot of extra time on their hands.  If you don't want to need to think while reading a novel, this is the book for you.  Don't look for any depth, you won't find it.  What you will find is a sense of nostalgia for your childhood, and the fears you had and took for granted.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Any scientific movie when it gets to Hollywood becomes terrible. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" by Ron Howard is no exception. While the book by Sylvia Nassar was very good, the movie changed the story and cast the wrong people. Firstly, the story, Nash was divorced by his wife but she continued to take care of him. I do not know why they had to change the story, having the original story would not have diminished his accomplishments in any way. Though he was outstanding in his work, he was portrayed to be a gentle, bumbling person. In reality he was a pretty mean person who was incredibly jealous of his colleagues. He was also racist and used to remark about his Jewish colleagues who were brilliant. This is especially true in the area of economics as more than 45% of the Noble prize winners are Jewish. Hollywood movies are terrible at portraying how scientific ideas are arrived upon. The part where he comes up with the idea in game theory in a bar was the silliest. In reality, it was a culmination of a lot of work started by great minds such as John von Neumann. I have taken courses in this and found the whole thing ridiculous. <br /> <br />Next the cast, I do not think that Russell Crowe to be the wrong person for the role. Firstly, he is too musculur to be an MIT professor, they did not have time then to work out in gyms for 2 hours a day. While professors come in all types and can be eccentric, they were rarely muscular. Crowe's accent does not go well with that of Nash also. He is better suited for movies like Gladiator and L.A.Confidential. He was miscast in this role. Jennifer Connelly did a terrific job as his wife. The direction was terrible though. Ron Howard is not suited for such movies and is more for run of the mill movies. In general, I do not think that this movie deserved the best picture award. I guess that it was a weak year.
B0000DBJ2B|3.0|This is one of my favourite films of all time, which in itself I give a resounding 5 stars.  The Collectors Edition however is a disapointment, the only difference being essentially an extra booklet with concept art and production notes. <br /> <br />For anyone who owns The World Of The Dark Crystal, paying the extra money for The Collectors Edition is unnecessary.  Save your money, buy the regular film, and spend it on the sequel which Brian Froud and the Henson Company currently have in discussion!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|20 years ago George Lucas set out to make a space western with unparalell success. <br /> <br />3 Years ago Joss Whedon set out to make a spaghetti space western and even though was somewhat unsuccesfull the short lived series managed to become a cult item. <br /> <br />The series follows the adventures of nine persons who can not be more different but with one single thing in common, Serenity. <br /> <br />I have but one problem with this series. it ends too soon with so many questions and situations unresolved, that a feature film was in order BIG time. <br /> <br />Unforgetable characters like Inara, a companiant with an angel face. River, a troubled kid with amazing supernatural powers which we were only shown a bit. Keeley a girl mechanic who is in love with love and with Serenity; Zoe the right hand of the captain who is not only though but tender with her hubby (the pilot no less) All guided by Mal Raynolds, a former soldier turned pirate, but with a heart. <br /> <br />The ship is amazing and the series deserved better luck, hopefully after \\"Serenity\\" hits the theaters it will catch a second wind. <br /> <br />We can only hope.
0062502182|4.0|This is a book to read for the journey, not the conclusion.  Santiago, referred to simply as `the boy' for virtually the entire story, goes through a series of travels, with his flock of sheep in Spain and to North Africa and so on, and along the way meets a number of fascinating people.  The writing is gentle and the ideas, spiritual or religious or lifetime philosophical, give one pause to ponder often, and are, in many ways, the highlight of the book, the thing that makes it so well worth reading.  If the measure of a book is its bringing you to see things in a different way, this one succeeds gently and thoroughly.  If it's to tell an interesting yarn, this does it well for a significant portion of the novel, but fell a little bit short with an ending I thought disingenuous.  I would, nevertheless, comfortably recommend it to someone who enjoys thought-provoking reading as a part of his or her \\"Personal Legend.\\"  (As explained warmly in the book.)
B0000669JL|5.0|If this review was based strictly on the material included, that would be five stars. No Woman No Cry, I Shot the Sherrif, Buffalo Soldier, Get Up Stand Up, Jamming, Exodus, Stir It Up, Redemption Song, Waiting In Vain and Punky Reggae Party are all, thankfully included. Butif I were to rate based on what it DOESN'T have, Trench Town Rock, Roots Rock Reggae, Lively Up Yourself and Rebel Music have all been left off for some reason. Still, Bob Marley is essential listening for all music fans.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|... and this release is certainly not a failure.  <br /> <br />Firstly I must state that \\"Apollo 13\\" is one of my favourite movies, therefore I was both favorably inclined towards this release and disposed towards being critical of substandard features. <br /> <br />This release is technically excellent, both the Theatrical Release and IMAX versions are clean prints with good quality sound. The menus are clear and work well, allowing easy navigation of features. The case and slip cover are high quality and use some of the original imagery from the theatrical release posters. <br /> <br />The commentaries on the Theatrical Release are an asset, particularly the one by Jim and Marilyn Lovell. Their comments underline the fidelity of the movie to the events depicted and the recreation of the hardware and the procedures.  <br /> <br />Although I won't deliver any spoilers, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is that there is genuine suspense regarding the ending, even though I - and most people who were around in 1970 - know what happened. This is testimony to the writing and to Ron Howard's direction. <br /> <br />This is also reflected in the documentary \\"Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13\\" where the crew and cast members come across as being absolutely commited to portraying events accurately, but in a way that underscored the innate drama of them. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris particularly stand out in this regard. The interviews with the people they portrayed are thought-provoking and make the viewer re-examine the way in which many recent mainstream films have mangled history \\"for dramatic effect\\". \\"Apollo 13\\" is proof that that doesn't need to be the case. <br /> <br />To Quote Jim Lovell: \\"Gentlemen, it has been a priveledge to fly with you.\\" <br /> <br />Highly recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in the space program.

His ability to then take it to the next level of quantam physics is very smooth and logical. <br />I am still processing all the info and looking at where I am stuck in my beliefs.
B00003CXA2|5.0|My God, if you don't have this classic of a movie in your collection what the hell is wrong with you.  I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks and I thought he did a superb job of playing Forrest Gump.  If you thought this movie was dumb or just plain stupid, you have issues that should be dealt with right away.  I was about 14 or 15 years old when this movie came out and even then as a young teenage girl, I knew that this movie would be a classic.
0195067142|4.0|This is the first book I have read about the War in the Pacific as faced by the Marines but what I have heard about this theater previously was put into even more harsh words from a participant (Sledge).  This text is definately easy to read, Sledge is not a very verbose person, but this makes the book quite enjoyable and I have had problems putting it down since I picked it up.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Pacific Theather.
0975991477|5.0|I would not miss this book for the world! This brilliant man is bringing forth knowledge in a way that anyone can understand it. <br />We so need this kind of information for the evolution of  our planet. If I were to clone someone, it would be a person like Bruce Lipton. We need to spread the word far and wide! Thank you for giving us the opportunity to voice our praise.I have some of his videos and now I have his priceless book to add to my collection. A must have book by one of our most important visionaries. <br />Suzy Star

1932100385|3.0|A well documented study by the author justifying the importance of a vegetarian diet. I feel the content of the text could have been reduced in half and still met its mission.

0671027387|4.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is a fine thriller that arrived before Dan Brown took up the religious themes that catapulted him into the realm of the Left Behind. I enjoyed this book much more than \\"Angels and Demons\\" or the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", if only because he wrote his characters much more fully and believably. \\"Deception Point\\" is another \\"conspiracy\\" novel, but in this novel the conspirators are elements within the good old American government. His \\"bad guy\\" government agency is a little hard to swallow, and the character written as the president of the United States is a little improbable, but otherwise his plot moves at a good suspenseful clip and his characters are developed better than anything else I have read by this author.<br /><br />The real revelations in \\"Deception Point\\", though, are the technologies Brown describes. He writes in the beginning of the book that the technologies he describes exist today, and are, presumably, currently in use by our government. Conspiracy Theorists could launch a whole new wave of paranoia based upon some of the elements within this book, but I just enjoy a good suspense story from time to time.
0060229357|5.0|I bought this for my Godson's first birthday.  It was one of my favorites growing up and since it was the 50th Edition, I had to buy it.  It was a favorite of mine and definitely a classic for the kids of the future.
B000000WA4|5.0|From metal anthems to quiet harp melodies, playful romps to power ballads, alt-rock to soul, Smashing Pumpkins' double album opus (also considered their best ever) Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness has an amazing array of musical styles that totally differ form each other, yet still holds together in a way that you know \\"XYU\\" and \\"Cupid De Locke\\" are on the same album.  <br /> <br />Billy Corgan still amazes; his passionate voice that goes from whispering to screaming in an instant, his utterly enthralling, poetic lyrics that Kurt Cobain wouldn't have touchedwith a 10-foot pole, and as a guitarist, he plays scorching, dextrous riffs effortlessly. (Is that him playing that riff on Jellybelly?) James Iha plays great lead guitar, Jimmy Chamberlin is one of the most amazing drummers I've ever heard, and D'Arcy, well...D'arcy plays the bass guitar. <br /> <br />Oh, and Smashing Pumpkins totally beats Nirvana. Well, Krist is a better bassist than D'arcy, but that's it. Jimmy > Dave, Billy > Kurt. Want creativity? Don't listen to \\"Lithium\\", listen to \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\"! Want rock? Listen to \\"Jellybelly\\" not \\"On A Plain\\" or \\"Territorial Pissings\\". I'll admit, Smells Like Teen Spirit is a pretty ass-kicking song, but the lyrics suck. And Kurt's voice makes William Hung sound like Frank Sinatra. I'm just saying if you're a Nirvana fan, it's time to check out some real music and lyrics without \\"A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido\\" crapola. <br />\\"My little group has always been and always will until the end\\" is no \\"and what you never knew can never get to you so fake it\\". <br /> <br />Alright, now that i'm done with my Nirvana lecture, let's get down to business.  <br /> <br />disc 1 <br /> <br />MC&TIS-10/10 a beautiful piano song with some violin. <br />tonight, tonight-10/10 another beautiful, glorious song...fantastic in every way <br />jellybelly-9/10 near metal anthem...almost perfect. fantastic drums and guitar. <br />zero-9/10 the song featured whenthe pumpkins appeared on the simpsons...very dark, very confessional, very cool. <br />here is no why-8.5/10 alright song during the song part of the song, but the chorus is enthralling. it saves the whole song from mediocrity. <br />bullet with butterfly wings-10/10 the pumpkins most famous song...another dark one with great lyrics and an explosive climax. <br />to forgive-8/10 truly 'mellon collie' indeed...but the lyrics...they're so infectious... <br />an ode to no one-9/10 a new one for the pumpkins-a faster paced, more punkish song. my favorite lyric? \\"galaxies full of nobodies...\\" <br />love-8/10 a big surprise...electro metal! <br />cupid de locke-10/10 floating harp and violin (i think) in a truly pretty song. eat this kurt...yeah your music was so creative... <br />galapogos-9/10 soft alt rock...but theres something about how it's so soft, yet so ready to explode...like soma... <br />muzzle-8/10 pop. but the drumming redeems it. its something you can play along with. <br />porcelin of the vast oceans-10/10 the pumpkins 9-minute altrock opera. <br />take me down-7/10 james iha's voice has a close, warm feeling to it, and thats all thats okay about the song. the weakest on the album. <br /> <br />disc 2 <br /> <br />where boys fear to tread-9/10 alRIGHT! now were down to business! very solid song. great vocals. is that darcy in the background? <br />bodies-9/10 passionate vocals and the song rocks hard, but theres a softer tone to the guitar...its not as jagged and ear piercing as songs like geek usa... <br />thirty three-11/10 flawless. perfect. in every way. <br />in the arms of sleep-8/10 nice calming song. <br />1979-10/10 classic song. <br />tales of a scorched earth-5/10 the crappiest song on the slbum. <br />theres nothing good about this song. <br />thru the eyes of ruby-9/10 a magical song. a little overlong, but thats alright. <br />stumbleine-10/10 a gorgeous acoustic song with thoughtful lyrics. <br />x.y.u.-N/A i could give this song a one or aten. i could say its just a screaming rant, or i could say it's an anguish filled, enthralling experience. you have to decide for yourself. <br />we only come out at night-9/10 dramatic vocals for such a childish song. very very creative. <br />beautiful-10/10 i cant describe this. its just too great and well, beautiful. <br />lily (my one and only) 8/10 childisdh song but still a classic. <br />by starlight-7/10 for a sp song, shapeless, and frankly, kind of boring. <br />farewell and goodnight-10/10 perfect finale <br /> <br /> <br />okay im getting tired of writing this review by now. ill keep it frank. if you want one of the greatest albums you'll ever hear, buy this now. if you're even thinking about buying this album, buy it now. i dont want you to miss out on this enthralling, magical, dramatic, creative, bautiful experience. <br /> <br />oh and guess what billy corgan wants to reunite smashing pumpkins. new album? a us tour? hmmmm... <br />

B00005JNBQ|1.0|To enjoy this movie you either need to be, A) so bored by life that this film is somehow funny to you, because the characters are that pathetic, OR B) you feel sorry for them... again, because the characters are really that pathetic. Neither of these is a reason to waste your time watching the movie, much less be obsessed with this film. Watching a dog do it's business or watching paint dry is more fun. The intro of the movie with all the creative ways they display the credits would be the only good part of the movie. People, go live some life... don't waste it on this film. Strive to be more than this.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This is so far my favorite of the Alien series. It wasn't as good as Predator 2, mind you, which I would give a 10, but I would still  give this second Alien movie a 9 out of 10. The fight scenes were really cool, intense, and wicked stellar, the Alien's themselves were scarier, nastier, and more vicious and bloodthirsty than ever before(as well as bigger and stronger!)I loved the team that Ripley and Newt made(I love it when I see girlpower, being a female lover) and I thought the other soldiers were wicked awesome, especially with a large gun in their hands, be it flame-thrower, shotgun or a grenade launcher. The Alien births were cooler and bloodier than the first movie, and there was tons and tons of suspense, as well! Oh, and to you who love to curse, this movie had a lot more language than the first one! (Hot Dog!)Anyway, this is the second best space monster movie I have ever seen next to Predator 2, and I recommend it to all who like or love bloody and action packed science fiction movies.
0694524743|5.0|We heard this book on tape, and my kids absolutely loved it!  We were sorry when it was over, and wanted to hear more.  We often sat in the car still listening even when we were done driving.  It is a wonderful, magical story, and now we want to hear the other Chronicles stories.

1559949902|4.0|We purchased this story on tape after hearing many other ones by Roald Dahl, and we were not disappointed.  It is an abridged version, which is too bad, since great details from the book are left out, but still it was a great story.  We wished it was longer.  All kids would love this.
B00005JNTX|5.0|If you've ever read the comics, you would know that this movie is frame-for-frame, line-for-line (almost) accurate. There has never been a movie adaptation this close to a comic book before, and that's a good thing.  <br /> <br />I saw the movie first, then bought the graphic novels, and now I'm in love with Sin City. Do yourself a favor and pick up the Sin City Graphic Novel Library. Amazon sells it for $125. It's worth every penny.
B000088E6D|4.0|I really really really LIKE this CD. I can't say I love it though. Many of the tracks are fantastic--especially Kissing a Fool and Come Fly With Me. However, some of the tracks have a little bit of an American Idol feel to them. Other than that, the vocals are outstanding and the CD is very well produced. If you're a big fan of the standards, then this is definitely worth owning. Just be prepared for a little bit of that American Idol feel.

0141439513|5.0|I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.<br /><br />It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.<br /><br />We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.<br /><br />In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.<br /><br />I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen.
078322737X|5.0|Im 17 years old, and have watched this movie as a little kid millions of times. My dad LOVES this movie. I got so sick of it that each time we watched it, i was always \\"daydreaming\\" of other things. <br /> <br />I wanted to give him a good gift and get him his favorite movie. I automatically thought of this movie and bought it instantly. <br /> <br />Well, I decided to watch it. (now that im older, able to understand what all the \\"kids\\" are going through.) It really hits home for a teenager to be graduating because all your friends truely are leaving and going seperate ways.  <br /> <br />Now that i understand the lines and plot, it has become my favorite movie. The DVD makes the movie easier to follow, it doesnt have a near black scene unlike the VHS where it is amazingly grainy and dark. They even put in a new sky for the opening scene. Go check it out. <br /> <br />This movie is a best buy for any car racing person. The story/plot hits home to just about everyone. If you had friends in highschool, this movie is for you.

1592400876|5.0|This book made me laugh, it made me think, and at times it made me sad. I didn't buy this book as a style guide and I don't think that writing one was the author's primary intention. Truss felt the need to vent regarding the current epidemic of punctuation misuse, and I had several giggles as I vented along with her. Truss allows that some punctuation issues aren't easy to agree on but she also points out that some rules are so simple (think it's vs. its) that there is no excuse for the mistakes we see almost daily. I don't think that a \\"non-stickler\\" would appreciate Truss's humor. However, if you've ever wanted to pull out a red pen and add or delete a comma in public, run--don't walk--to your nearest bookstore and buy this book.
B000929AJQ|2.0|This is not the NIN I grew up with and fell in love with. For all you music lovers just getting turned on by NIN please do not sum up trent reznor's musical genius by this album. It is at the very least an experiment gone wrong. The Trent I know wouldn't allow this type of industrial bubble gum to be chewed on by even people he really dislikes much jess his true, die hard fans. If you really want to know what NIN albums to actually purchase then may I suggest \\"pretty hate machine\\" and \\"the downward spiral\\",\\"broken\\". I even liked \\"the fragile\\". It grew on me eventually. I guess Trent is no longer a perfectionist. I have convinced myself that in this day and age of music swapping that most bands are starting to tour more and release a lot more albums a hell of a lot faster than usual to stay accustomed to living the lavish lifestyle they have grown accustomed to. They are trying to make a living by making music. <br />I don't know why this was even released for mass consumption. <br />If you are looking for good industrial music then also check out <br />ministry \\"kianh(psalm69: the way to succeed and the way to suck eggs) and also a goody by ministry is \\"the mind is a terrible....\\" or \\"land of rape and honey\\" plus \\"in case you didnt feel like showing up\\"...........\\"filth pig\\" and even \\"houses of the mole\\" is less of a let down than this. <br />This album is mediocre at best. Other bands to look up for you youngsters is helmet, tool, prong \\"cleansing\\" , kmfdm, skinny puppy, depeche mode, the cure,the smiths, ministry!!!, pantera, sepultura, janes addiction, porno 4 pyros, alice in chains, nirvana.........etc.......this is the music I grew up being exposed to....I'm what I guess you would call a generation X 'er <br />and there has not been any really good music released since that time when I was a teenager. Before my generation there was a myriad of great music I looked into like new order or bauhaus,the church,the clash , the sex pistols....etc...I thought NIN wouldstill hold true even now in this time of disposable music and american idols but i guess I was wrong.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I hate to be a book snob when reviewing a movie, but when the title of the movie is \\"I, Robot\\" and is said to be \\"inspired by\\" the classic science fiction collection by Isaac Asimov, one would have a reasonable assumption that the movie would bear some similarity and passing understanding of the source material.  Then, when the director of the movie is Alex Proyas, the director of the excellent \\"Dark City\\", there is a level of intelligence that is expected from the film version of \\"I, Robot\\".<br /><br />I don't know what happened.<br /><br />This is such a disappointment.  Without spoiling a single plot detail I can reveal almost exactly how much this movie resembles the book: The Three Laws of Robotics, a couple of character names (most notably Susan Calvin), the title, and that there are, in fact, robots.  That just about covers any similarity the astute viewer may find with the book.  This is unfortunate because any one of a number of the \\"I, Robot\\" stories could have been used as a launching pad for an intelligent science fiction movie.  Or, even the later Elijah Bailey Robot novels would have worked.  But this?  There is the barest framework of a plot, the barest scrapings of Asimov's ideas, and wrapped tightly around this is a silly action movie.<br /><br />The problem is only half about the movie itself.  By calling itself \\"I, Robot\\" there is a level of expectation of what sort of movie this will be and what it will be about.  Imagine, perhaps if Peter Jackson made Lord of the Rings with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Gandalf and Gandalf ran around hitting the Orcs with moves you might only see in \\"Conan the Destroyer\\".  That's a moderately fair comparison in making \\"I, Robot\\" into nothing more than a flashy action movie and how exactly Alex Proyas did this is completely beyond my understanding.<br /><br />My guess is that the studio took a lot of control away from Proyas' vision.  That's the only thing that makes sense to me.  But let's think about \\"I, Robot\\" as something other than an offshoot of Asimov's work.  How does it work as a mindless action movie?  On these terms \\"I, Robot\\" isn't that bad.  It's nothing special and we've seen it dozens of times.  Will Smith does fine as a the wise cracking detective investigating a murder of a human where the only possibly suspect is a robot except a robot couldn't do it because of the three laws.  Smith is actually quite a bit more serious in this role than one might expect.  He cracks wise often enough, but overall is toned down and has a seething anger towards robots just under the surface.  It works.  The action probably works better on a larger screen than a smaller television, but for a simple action movie I suppose \\"I, Robot\\" can pass muster.<br /><br />Forget that this movie is science fiction because it really isn't.  Forget that this movie is inspired by Asimov's classic work because it really isn't.  Forget that this should have been and could have been an excellent, intelligent and still entertaining movie, because it isn't.  If you're looking for just a decent action movie with very few claims to be anything else besides some lip service paid to the plot...here you go.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry\\"I, Robot\\" as something other than an offshoot of Asimov's work.

B0002S947K|5.0|I happen to be (...)on Gomez's artist page when I looked under related artists and found Ray LaMontagne.    Even though I wouldn't compare Ray LaMontagne to Gomez, I was glad to have found out about him.    Trouble is an awesome debut CD. Ray has a slightly smoky, soulful sound to his voice which makes me melt. His songs are likeable right off the bat. It only took me a few listens to love his CD.    Personal favorites of mine are, \\"Forever My Friend\\", \\"Trouble\\", \\"How Come\\" and \\"Hold You in My Arms\\".    Definately a promising artist. I hope to see more of him in the future.

0895260131|5.0|I served as a Foreign Service Officer in a Middle Eastern country where I witnessed black African slaves in Arab households in 1978.  I am also familiar with the history of the forcible domination of Middle Eastern and North African Christian and Jewish societies by Islamic hoards launched by the Mohammed himself, the 800 year Islamic domination of Spain , the brutal Islamic domination of Orthodox Christian societies in Greece and the Balkans until less than 100 years ago and the despicable treatment of non-Muslims in every Islamic-majority country down to the present.  <br /> <br />So what?  Well...  I am constantly and increasingly amazed and dismayed how many friends and acquaintances, many with postgraduate educations, have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what Islamic societies are actually like (subjugation of women, honor killings, etc.) or that any of the events I describe above actually occurred.  Just a week ago an intelligent, educated friend who often visits Europe said words to the effect, \\"Yes, yes, Islamic terror is awful but didn't we start it all with the Crusades?\\"  I was appalled he had no awareness that the Crusades were a much-too-late response to Muslims overrunning the Holy Land 500 years earlier or anything about the historic Islamic quest for world dominance at the expense of all other belief and social systems. <br /> <br />The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is a useful \\"second opinion\\" about to Islamic dogma, thought,  tradition and history for those have only heard the version presented by PBS, the BBC and various Islamic apologists.  It will enlighten any non-Muslim who wants to understand what Jihad is all about.  While arguably superficial by necessity because Spencer covers so much ground in a relatively small space, it provides enough information for most people.  This book can also serve as an introduction for those inclined toward deeper study of religious, historical and comparative social analysis books that treat Islamic topics more comprehensively. <br /> <br />I'm buying copies of this book to give to friends and business associates who need this information.  The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) should be on the desk of President Bush and every one of his cabinet officers. <br /> <br />

0684833395|5.0|\\"Catch-22,\\" by Joseph Heller, follows the activities of a World War II aviation squadron in the European theater.  Much of the novel revolves around Captain Yossarian, a bombardier in the squadron.  Heller has crafted an outrageous satire of the military.  He mercilessly mocks many aspects of the military: rank structure, chain of command, protocol, the military justice system, the chaplaincy, the military medical establishment, and more.  Heller's squadron and its higher headquarters form a world of cowardice, opportunism, and scheming; particularly biting is his portrait of jealousy, vanity, and self-serving ambition among the senior officers.<br /><br />The book is filled with many absurd images and zany situations, as well as with characters who have such names as Major Major, Colonel Korn, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf.  Heller's prose is a delight; the pages crackle and pop with clever wordplay and witty lines.  The book made me laugh out loud.  But the wacky comedy and merry prose style are wedded to a dark vision; the book is full of graphic violence and Kafkaesque nightmarishness.  There are also some vividly rendered scenes of aerial combat.  It's quite a remarkable blend.<br /><br />The story follows Yossarian and his comrades in combat, while being treated in the hospital, during down time on their base, and on their recreational excursions into war-torn Italy.  We see the relationships among the squadron members, as well as their dalliances with the women they meet during their tour.  And we also learn the meaning of Catch-22, a bureacratic clause that controls the destinies of these military men.  Yossarian is a compelling antihero, and \\"Catch-22\\" is a richly ironic work of satire.  The book has endured for decades, and is, in my judgment, more relevant than ever in the \\"global war on terror\\" era..
B0006GVJEE|5.0|`Leon' - `The Professional' was directed by Luc Besson in 1994, and it's one of his masterpieces. This dramatic and thrilling film stretching over 110 min. was filmed in New York and Paris, France. <br /> <br />One day, a twelve -year old New York girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman) find her family has been murdered by a drug dealer, Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his team. Mathilda runs to Leon (Jean Reno) for help. He is her neighbor having an unusual profession as a hit-man, and he teaches her the skills so that she can take her revenge.  <br /> <br />Leon is a sensitive man having the moral-`No woman, No children'-and his best friend is potted plants. As he survives with Mathilda, he gradually discovers the reason for living for someone. Needles to say, his performance is breathtaking. Portman also shows her talent in this her debut work. She portrays her emotions vividly. Moreover, I want you pay attention to Oldman. His psychotic-like performance is impressive. <br /> <br />Each character gives us brilliant performance. This movie keeps us in suspense to the end, and it describes the fleeting weird relationship between Leon and Mathilda well. So, I want to give this film the highest mark and I'm sure that people who like action and thrilling movies must enjoy this impressive movie.  <br />

0790732254|5.0|It would be a dull mind indeed that would respond to this film with anything but respect, awe, and terror.  Unlike many \\"classics\\" that the AFI has rated as Tried and True, most of which are dry as bone and lacking any relevance to the present time, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" explores, through the lens of a demented union between a man and a woman locked in psychical mortal combat, questions (truth/illusion, unhappiness, et al) that will never leave the human mind untouched.<br /><br />Performances on the part of Burton and Taylor are nothing less than bone chilling.  George and Martha are aging members of a prestigious, unnamed University: George is a History teacher, and Martha is the daughter of the University's dean. A true monster of a human being, she takes a inexplicable delight in tearing George to pieces, reducing him to the sum of his failures with her shrill, bratty voice.  George does not suffer quietly for long, as we sense he has been doing for years as the film opens.  His razor sharp tongue and amusing capacity for exposing Martha for what she really is--a spoiled drunk with a lot of undeserved pull--is drop dead funny at times, and ruthless at others.  Ultimately George wins because of his thoughtful, literate nature: Martha's brutality, which is considerable, is finally conquered by his decision to take it all the way, strip all the illusions \\"right down to the bone\\".<br /><br />George is no saint, however; he is built on many of the same  animalistic impulses that Martha is, only we detect a shred of something human in him as the nightmarish evening rolls on.<br /><br />Two guests arive late in the night, and almost immediately things go from 0-60.  The moment that the \\"tall, well built\\" Nick (George Segal) opens the door, Martha yells \\"goddamn you!\\" to George.  For a moment the camera fixes on the young man's eyes, as the beginnings of realization take hold that he is walking into a borderline-psychotic household.  His wife, a secretly mentally ill, delicate, and (as it turns out, victimized) young woman, is the one who suffers the most from the \\"night of fun and games with George and Martha\\".<br /><br />More than George or Martha, I found Nick the most repulsive character.  Amidst the madness and the unbelievably vicious psychological games that Martha and George inflict on each other, more out of need than irritation, he keeps his mind on his career as a professor.  The constantly flowing alcohol fuels the madness, as all of the very nasty warts George and Martha have fermented over the miserable years are exposed. The mystery of this film is that despite absolute mayhem of their relations, George and Martha are held together by something that seems real.<br /><br />In the hopeless night that Martha and George inhabit, the question of whether truth even exists is raised not out of any academic intellectuality, but out of the overwhelming pain and bitterness of their lies.  The ending implies that while they may seem fearless indulging their pathos;they do fear the direction in which they are headed: absolute insanity.<br /><br />The atmosphere can only be classified as horror coupled with black humor.  You feel like you are actually there.<br /><br />It is far, far better than \\"Citizen Kane\\", leaves \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in the dust, and, above all, makes one wonder what Richard Burton could have done with his extraordinary talent if he could have let the booze alone and stopped getting involved in failed marriages and ridiculous movies.  Burton as George, the bookish, alcoholic husband of Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), is as sadly fitting a role in the personal sense as Rock Hudson's in \\"Seconds\\".  Burton was often known to say \\"Wherever the books are, home is\\" and had extreme potential.

Similar to Zen and The Brain in it's implications I found this resource of great use.  I recommend this book to any spiritual skeptics out there, although I found reading a lot of the science a bit dry. What the dry stuff meant in the end was worth pushing through it :OD.  Overall quite a good and enlightening read.

I grew up watching this and will never tire of hearing Manuel say 'que?'.  Some bits may be a little politically incorrect for today's society, but for me that's where the beauty lies.  An excellent series unfortunately cut short, but probably all better for it (and it helps keep the price reasonable).

B000002UA5|5.0|\\"Ummagumma\\" is a watershed recording by this influential band, a pretty good document to the live shows, and a look into what they were all about, individually, in the studio.<br /><br />The live disc, disappointing only by the inclusion of just four selections, and no ability to see the live production on stage that was as much Floyd as the music was, is still a really good thing to listen to; the way they developed the original \\"songs\\" into these soundscapes, is all you need to expand your consciousness, it's not \\"drug music,\\" it's an anti-drug. All you need is a little imagination, and a dark, quiet place to listen, and you will go places you've only imagined. \\"Astromomy Domine\\" is the hats-off this record gives to original guitarist Syd Barrett, playing it fairly true to the original, with an expanded instrumental break that quiets down, to feature only Rick Wright on Farfisa organ, and I would think this has some really spectacular visuals in the light show, sadly not available here. There was talk of including \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" on this disc, and I'll spend the rest of my life wondering why it wasn't.<br /><br />A lot has been said about the rest of the live recordings, how much people in general prefer the live versions over their original counterparts, but I can't pick sides. Every version of all four of these performances has something to sell it over the others, \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene,\\" \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,\\" and \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets,\\" all are masterpieces, and these versions do not disappoint.<br /><br />The studio recordings are just self-indulgent experiments, each member of the band being given carte blanche (spelling?) to do as he pleases. The most impressive sounding, as I see it, is Wright's \\"Sysyphus.\\" An error in the CD formatting has the second half of Part One being titled as Part Two. They split Part One, and Part One actually includes that thundering piano solo. Part Two is actually that noisy piece, with all the screechy noises and double-tracked piano, and if you listen, the piano parts are being played by reaching inside the piano, and plucking the piano wires, like playing a harp. That gives it that \\"twangy\\" sound; it's not normal, anybody can see that. Part Three, on the original vinyl LP, is the quiet, relaxing section, Wright playing mellotron, organ, vibes, bass, and slide guitar,and adding the bird chirps and waterfall sounds, it's so serene, and then...<br /><br />Part Four comes out of nowhere, so loud, so sudden, and as you reach around the room trying to find your heart (because it jumps out of your chest at this point),the tympani and cymbals seem to go on forever. When the music (and your pulse) settle down, an eerie sounding swirl of layer upon layer of organ music is the center of attention, devoid of melody, growing louder and louder, until you start to hear a reprise of the theme of Part One, and it closes with a rendition of the opener, played in the most exaggerated, gothic sounding bit in the whole set. I think it's spectacular.<br /><br />The original LP has Part one being the beginning theme, including the long, thundering piano solo. Part Two is the \\"noisy\\" part, sounding like John Cage, or something weird like that. Part Three is the quiet part, and Part Four is the loud sudden part, through the end.<br /><br />Roger Waters contributed two numbers, the idyllic \\"Grandchester Meadows,\\" two acoustic guitar parts played by Waters through overdubbing, and he does the two-part harmony vocals the same way. It's quiet, relaxing, you can almost see morning sunlight, dew on the grass, birds in the trees, just a gentle ballad. This, of course, segues into \\"Several Species...\\" I'll let the reader read the whole title off the CD label, or from other reviews. What is it with Waters and long titles? This is nothing more than an experiment in recording techniques, the sound of birds at the beginning being the only real animal sounds. The rest is tape-loops that Waters made of his own voice, sped up way past David Seville's \\"Chipmunk\\" speed, and it puts The Beatle's \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" in its place. It's a spectacular sounding bit of studio work, a masterpiece in itself. I won't even try to describe the \\"rant;\\" it's practically indecipherable.<br /><br />David Gilmour's contribution (that's \\"G-I-L-M-O-U-R) is the three-part \\"The Narrow Way.\\" The opening part is just a feel-good shuffle on acoustic guitars, with some light percussion and some synthesizer work to break it up. \\"Part Two\\" is a repititious Black Sabbath-type riff, with lots of REALLY STRANGE noises piled on top, obscuring the melody, fading into a single, oscillating note. This begins \\"Part Three,\\" one of the only two real \\"songs\\" on the disc. Gilmour has never been proud of his abilities as a lyricist, and it shows here; the vocals are mixed way down, and the lyrics aren't even printed in the packaging. That said, he shows what a good all-around musician he is. He did all the vocals, all the guitars, organ, piano, drums, and bass himself. A lot of people seem to like \\"The Narrow Way\\" the most.<br /><br />Nick Mason's bit, \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" is one of the most under-rated pieces in the Floyd catalogue. Although he's a drummer/percussionist, Mason is a classically trained violinist. How well he plays violin is yet to be seen, but he has a knowledge of music theory. He wrote the melody to \\"Part One (Entrance),\\" and had his wife, Lindy play it on flute, you can hear that it's two parts recorded separately, and edited together, and Nick then treats you to a collage of sounds(\\"Part Two: Entertainment\\"), some are drums, some are other things, with a bizarre, tuneless melody, probably a mellotron, in the background. The middle section is so ominous and creepy, it could be a horror movie soundtrack. Close listening will show that it's the \\"Part One\\" melody, played backward. He brings it back to earth with various drum and percussion sounds, and what makes this remarkable, is this was all done with analogue tape. There's no \\"sampling\\" here, it's all done by splicing tape (This was, after all, 1969).<br /><br />He then climaxes the piece with a multi-layered drum solo, and even though it is over-dubbed, it shows abilities that he doesn't get a lot of credit for. \\"Part Three: Exit,\\" is a reprise of \\"Part One,\\" only with a little more complex arrangement, courtesy Lindy Mason on flute again.<br /><br />Disc two is not a commercial effort, it's just a chance for the four talents to do as they please, and I think they all do a fine job. Even if you don't like Avant-Garde experimentation, the live portion of this release alone, makes it well worth your time.s.

B0009KA7BS|5.0|Ok I understand this is a bad movie. The story is good, but keanu..................actually Ill cut the crap. I loved this movie, and this is the type of movie I would not be caught watching. It was smart, and keanus character was soo bad ass that well in the end it was very rewarding. Now the movie does not make a hell lot of sence(heh he h eheh get it hell lot of sence) but if you stop to think about it is not completly out of reach of understanding, just use your brain this is not your tipical action movie with no thoughts or feelings, like the movie I will be reviewing next, the fantastic 4.

0060207051|5.0|I originally purchased this book about 24 years ago for my daughter (who is now 24) and because we had pet rabbits. I'd never heard of it but we all immediately loved it. When my daughter was three, we had to move. To prepare her for the move, we explained what was going to happen and gave her a chance to run around the new house. Especially, we read Good Night Moon every night for two or three weeks before the move. After the bunny said good night to everything in his room, I would say good night to all the important things in my daughter's room, pointing to them and making sure she saw them. When we moved, we set up her room first, and that first night, we read Good Night Moon and said good night to everything in her room. Not a peep that first night. Worked like a charm. Very smooth move for her.  <br />The real bunnies are long gone but they helped introduce us to several good rabbit stories. We give GNM and The Runaway Bunny to friends who are new parents. Now we're going to begin adding Guess How Much I Love You.
1573223085|4.0|This book confirmed much of my own thinking about what kind of students should be coming out of university programs and how to prepare them for the future job market in the US. Because, in the arts, we regularly think conceptually, it made me feel good about myself and my family. It has very good quotes and statistics for Strategic Planning or official documents that seem too artsy and vague.
0375422307|5.0|I just happened on the book in my local bookstore.  Its bright red cover attracted me.  I read the blurb, decided to check out the first few pages.  About a half hour later, I realized that I was clearly hooked, and I that I was going to buy the book even though I knew that I would be finishing it that night.  To join the chorus, I learned more about Iran and the Iranian revolution from this one book than from any other source.  It was like a big squegee that cleaned off a dirty window and I was able to say \\"Oh! I see!\\"  My first thought after reading it was \\"this should be required reading in school\\"  I see from another review here that it must be in some!  I also found out from a google search, that it is now required reading at West Point.  That's pretty impressive advertising right there.  The way Iranian history is so incredibly entwined with Marjane's life makes it all accessible and real.  She's just a regular kid, trying to do regular kid things, while all of these horrific things are happening around her.  Friends and Family disappearing while she's at school, a teenage desire to be \\"cool\\" suddenly turns into a frightening confrontation. You feel her family's hope, and their increasing panic, fear and depression as they realize their dreams for their country are not being realized. Meanwhile, life continues, as it must.
B00006879E|5.0|Being of the 40+ age group, I seldom buy anything by 'younger' bands..but I had heard a few cuts from this CD and loved them, so I bought the CD and was very glad I did.  This band has a great sound!  I highly recommend it!
B0002S943O|5.0|First let me say I loved this dvd!  This tour was the first that I'd ever seen the band live so - with repeated playings - this was a thrill for me to relive that.   <br /> <br />Second this tour was when the band's original four members were still together.  Making watching them play together more special for me.   <br /> <br />Featuring many of my favorite songs and the crowd experience on \\"Never Let Me Down\\" I highly recommend this dvd.
0790729628|2.0|I have to agree with the other critical comments here on this director's cut. The audio and video quality are no more than so-so, and although that is somewhat explainable because it was one of the first DVD transfers done, I wouldn't plunk your hard earned cash down for it yet. I'd wait until a better transfer is available.<br /><br />If you do, you'll still be rewarded with a great movie. Dick's vision L.A. is dark, dismal, and fraught with the perils of imperfect science in the shape of the homicidal androids. This future is interesting in that it invites comparison with H.G. Wells's great classic, The War of the Worlds. Few novels in the history of science fiction portray such a dire, dismal, hopeless, and pretty much depressing fate for mankind throughout the entire novel as Wells's book does. In many ways, the sci-fi genre was a literature of optimism as it was believed that science could solve all social problems and the future for humans and for society was bright. Wells's novel is almost unique in pointing out the risks of science and that the universe might be a bigger, more dangerous place than we had thought. Written at the end of the Gay Nineties, Wells's novel sounds an uncharacteristically cautious and sober note about mankind's possible future.<br /><br />In Bladerunner, Dick envisions a similarly dark, dismal, depressing, and in many ways, hopeless future. L.A. is even perpetually rainy, which adds to the film noir like atmosphere. We don't know if this is due to a climate shift or not in the movie, but maybe it's explained in the book. And like in War of the Worlds, science itself is shown to be a two-edged sword at it sometimes creates more problems than it solves in the imperfect androids, who serve well for a time, but then toward the end of their brief lives run amuck. Furthermore, science is unable to solve the problem and bounty hunters must be dispatched to terminate the androids when they do.<br /><br />Besides the androids, even the other humans are often shown as unprepossessing. The great scientist Tyrell is the ultimate nerd with literally coke-bottle lens glasses. And the dowdy technician, Sebastian, who takes the androids in, has some sort of skin disease that ages his face prematurely. He admires the andoids physical perfection since it contrasts with his own imperfection. And the psychologist who gets killed at the beginning of the movie when he gives the android the test seems smarmy and somewhat arrogant.<br /><br />One of the few positive characters, besides Harrison himself, is Sean Young, the beautiful, young android who doesn't even know she is an android. Her design is supposed to fix the problem, perhaps because she's ignorant of her own origins.<br /><br />Anyway, Dick's vision of the future reminded me of the great Wells classic from 1897 in its similarly dark, dismal, and depressing picture of the future.<br /><br />One final comment, if I remember right, Dick was married and divorced several times, and to the dismay of his former wives, there is often a shrewish woman in his stories that is no doubt intended to resemble his former spouse. I didn't see anyone like that in this movie, except perhaps for the Darryl Hannah android character perhaps, who isn't quite the same, but anyway, Dick was an interesting writer whose dyspeptic and dystopian visions of the future and on the dangers of science stood in contrast to much of the sci-fi genre.other humans are often shown as unprepossessing.

I believed it was a true story.  <br /> <br />I have read reviews that query the authenticity of this book. I now feel betrayed.

B0001KZM3O|4.0|Pink Floyd has become an obsession to me over the past year. I am still fairly young compared to their usual demographic, I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur, though I would say I am fairly knowledged in the history of Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd has had several different stages in their career and the stage I most lach on to is the ones where Roger Waters was primarily behind the helm rather than a overall group effort. As being he was the primary lyric writer during the bands most popular albums (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, The Final Cut). His lyrics just paint phenominal pictures. <br /> <br />Now to most 'The Final Cut' is an acquired taste, it is very emotional, dark & unlike any album that Pink Floyd has done. Though while my favorite albums are Animals & The Wall, I can easily accept this album and appreciate it. To some this album is a continuation of The Wall, it just paints this vivid picture of post war life after World War II, a very beautiful concept album.  <br /> <br />I give this album a 4/5. Right off the bat, I don't feel it deserves a 5 for the fact it wasn't primarily a group effort and while I find it to be a fantastic album, it just doesn't have the charm as 'Dark Side of the Moon', in which the band was in full comfortableness with one another. I feel it is an essential part of anyones Pink Floyd collection, though it is a must for any Roger Waters fan. The re-play value is 'often', at least for me. I find myself listening to this album, late at night, in the dark, just absorbing it.

Obviously you cannot capture the entirety of a book in a 2 hour movie; they are different medium. But I do believe the movie is as compelling and fun as the book.<br /><br />The actors are spot on. In fact, now that I am reading book 2 in the series I can't help but picture the actors from the movies. They are convincing, lovable and memorable. Especially Hagrid!<br /><br />I don't know how the rest of the series will turn out, but having seen 3 Harry Potter movies and read 2 books, I think they compliment each other as well as can be expected. Each adds a new dimension to the other.<br /><br />A must see for hardcore Potterite, and casual fan. You will enjoy the immersive fantasy world whether you have read the books or not.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I absolutely loved &quot;Greetings from Michigan&quot; but I must admit, I thought the whole &quot;50 albums for 50 states&quot; was a pretty thin premise and that he'd have quite a tough time outdoing the debut. Then along came &quot;Illinoise&quot;. <br />Stevens' skill as a composer of complex, emotionally-laden melodies is only increasing with time and practice, as is his ability to tap into the legends, triumphs and shames of a populace. <br />The album is a suite, designed to immerse the listener into the cultural identity of the place, and for that reason it is a shame to give any of the songs precedence over the others. However, if there is one song on this album that deserves special mention, it has to be &quot;John Wayne Gacy&quot;, a truly chilling and heartbreaking piece that highlights Stevens' real gift: sympathy - for victim and aggressor alike. He uses simple words and a soaring, theremin-like vocal line to bridge the gap between horror and acceptance, exposing the good an evil that lies in every heart. It still brings me to tears even after repeated listens.<br />Once again, his gentle take on the Christian faith comes to the fore, but as in &quot;Michigan&quot; it is less a cloying tack-on than a simple and truthful expression of thankfulness the source of his immense creativity and hope. It can't help but leave the listener thinking that if everyone knew Sufjan's version of God, the world just might be an immeasurably better place.<br />I came away from &quot;Illinoise&quot; with a renewed sense of faith -- in Sufjan himself. If he continues as strongly down this path he's set for himself we may be seeing the emergence of a true American musical genius, an unflinching Chronicler-in-Chief of the nation's dreams, crimes and acheivements.<br />I live in hope!
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I have enjoyed all 3 Harry Potter movies, but a warnign to parents with small children: view the movie before letting smaller children watch it. The Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the scariest and darkest of the 3 movies (not that I consider the other 2 scary or dark). The Dementors scared me, a little old 37 year old, and they are sure to send small children to bed with nightmares.<br /><br />With that said, the Prisoner of Azkaban does justice to the book. I feel that the movie does Harry Potter justice in form and feel. Obviously you cannot capture the entirety of a book in a 2 hour movie; they are different medium.

0553582445|5.0|Robin Hobb follows the life of FitzChivalry Farseer, who now goes by the name Tom Badgerlock, beginning 15 years after his life in her earlier Assassin series.  He returns to the court with the Fool, who now travels under the name Lord Golden, in order to preserve the throne of the Farseer heir, Prince Dutiful.  This begins a trilogy full of court intrigue, danger, and magic--both the royal magic of the Skill, and the condemned beast magic of the Wit.  Tom uses his previous experience as a young man in the court who was both blessed and cursed to have the Wit, that is, the ability to bond and communicate with an animal, to rescue Prince Dutiful, who is also put in danger because he is Witted.  This book is rich and engaging, full of suspense, yet with attention to well-rounded and complex characters.  The fantasy that Hobb creates is detailed and consistent enough that you can believe in and enter into it completely, yet not so overwrought that the story becomes about setting and spells instead of the central characters. <br /> <br />However, this book was the first Robin Hobb book I read, and that was a mistake.  This book has enough allusions to the Assassin Trilogy that I sometimes got lost.  Worse, when I went back and read the earlier series, major plot points had been given away in Fool's Errand.  So, if you've read the Assassin Trilogy, you will like the Tawny Man books at least as well.  If you haven't, I highly recommend Robin Hobb, but start with The Assassin's Apprentice, the first book in the Assassin Trilogy.
0670033375|4.0|Mr. Jared Diamond (author of that interesting \\"Collapse\\" book) suffers from a lack of imagination.  He should be wildly optimistic about the future of humanity. <br /> <br />Mr. Diamond shows in his book that the Norwegians in Greenland never ate fish even though they were plentiful.  Had they maintained this cultural habit from the homeland, or re-learned it from the competing Inuit, they might have survived a few hundred more years till the Little Ice Age retreated and then I'd be writing this in some Norwegian dialect.  Their stupid taboo has doomed me to write this in English instead. <br /> <br />Mr. Diamond also talks about the current drought in Australia, and the continuing devastation wrought by those pesky wabbits the colonists introduced hundreds of years ago that take the precious pasture from that most favorite of all Australian animals, the sheep.  When full-time drought and famine strike Australia and the rest of the world, and the Americans, Chinese, Australians, Indians, and sheep all eat each other <br />and die, the aboriginal population will survive on those wonderful rabbits and come in time to dominate the world.  They'll spread out from their current base of Australia and the highlands of New Guinea, reclaim Southeast Asia, spread west and <br />north into Eurasia, Africa, make it to the New New World, and dominate. <br /> <br />In the mean time, the last copy of Mr. Diamond's book will burn along with many others in a Parisian library in some riot over confiscated cheese, and much of Western Thought and Civilization will then be lost forever. <br /> <br />... and so it goes, the chasing after the wind, nothingness in newness under the sun.  Introduced foreign species have a role, and kudzu and rabbits will be pivotal in the next surge of civilization.  Count on it.  The future belongs to the aborigines , New Guineans, and the East Timorese.
0767805712|4.0|This film takes place in the near future in a dystopian America, in which most children are genetically engineered to eliminate risks for common diseases and to increase the probability of having desirable characteristics, such as mathematical or musical ability.  Children born the old-fashioned way are known as \\"In-valids,\\" and form a permanent underclass, assumed to be constitutionally inferior to their more systematically planned peers.  In this world, DNA from any source can be easily and quickly mapped to tell you all you want to know about potential employees, lovers, or criminal suspects.  In theory, this world is supposed to create healthy, \\"perfect\\" children, but the cost of this perfection is steep. <br /> <br />I'm not normally a devotee of science fiction, but this film works well as science, fiction, and social commentary.  The genetics is solid.  The claims made are modest and the technology described here either already exists or could exist in the near future.  The effects of genes are expressed as probabilities, which is not only good science but key to Gattaca's attack on genetic determinism.  Westerners have already fallen under the sway of the myth that our genes determine our future health and ability, and this film shows where such a misconception could lead.  I also love the creepy little details, especially the genetically engineered pianist who has compositions written just for him. <br /> <br />As fiction this film includes a love story, a murder mystery, and an underdog story about a man against a whole society that doesn't believe in him, and each of these stories works fairly well.  The three central characters, well-acted by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law, are complex, dynamic, and well-conceived.  They occupy different places in society, determined by the quality of their genes, and demonstrate the cost of rigid genetic determinism on everyone without giving up their humanity as characters and becoming mere puppets for the script-writers ideals. <br /> <br />As social commentary, this film raises issues about genetic engineering, privacy, prejudice, the weight of expectations both high and low, and human freedom in the face of deterministic scientific models.  Check out the deleted scenes.  There's a swipe at some procedures currently done at fertility clinics that was apparently too controversial--or unpopular--to include.  Thought-provoking and original. <br /> <br />I only gave this film four stars because sometimes the dialogue is a little stilted and because the pace drags here and there.  Also, at points the script relies a little too heavily on coincidence to move the plot forward. <br /> <br />However, this is generally an enjoyable and intriguing film.  It is definitely worth watching, and I'm glad I own it.  I've watched it several times.

I like action movies, suspense movies, and movies with strong female leads, so I thought I might like these.  I was wrong.  I hated these films.  The relentless, over-the-top violence and gore was mind-numbing and repugnant to me.  If anything, these films are proof that an NC-17 rating will never be given for violence. <br /> <br />No one can argue that these films are not well-made, creatively plotted and presented, and painstakingly choreographed.  But the violence is far greater than I was prepared for in a film that wins such praise.  Some argue that the violence is so extreme that it can be thought of as \\"cartoonish\\" and therefore not problematic in the way that watching, say, only a tenth as many blood-spurting murders would be.  But be warned:  Kill Bill careens from brutality to brutality.  Technical skill serves up savagery.  <br /> <br />Whether the art makes the splattered blood less soul-searing and more uplifting is a decision you have to make.  I found myself deeply disturbed during the films and long afterward. Caveat emptor.  Although these films have received extremely positive reviews, they are only for those who, for better or worse, can be numb to scores of brutal hand-to-hand murders portrayed on screen.
0671027387|4.0|All I can say is it was another work of genius by Dan Brown.  It was so fast-paced and action-packed that I don't believe there was even a moment I was bored. I highly recommend this book to people who can set aside a few hours to read it (trust me...you'll want to read it all in one sitting! It's impossible to put down!)
B0007M22TI|5.0|This Celtic woman gives high marks for a superb program.  All facets of the program (scenery, instrumental, vocal, etc.) were outstanding and, oh, the beauty of the music.  The clarity of the pure Irish soprano in all the performers assures me that I will play it again and again.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Overall the movie was good.  It is your typical man in power who uses his mind to break the bad habits of rebellious young people ans in the end gets through to them and they all go on to succeed.  Good movie with good acting.
6305014140|4.0|Everything a Manga movie should have. An exciting look into feudal Japan and the ninja way of life and the mercinary aspect of their work. But once Jubei finds himself in too deep into something that puts his very life on the line, he has to commit and see this venture through. What's more, it has loads of blood and violence in it too. a must have for any manga fan, nay any guy!
B00000IQW3|5.0|Loved the movie when I was a kid and love it as an adult.  If you like the 80's style space movies buy it today.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Finally, it came. And i wasn't disappointed! i saw this movie a long time ago on VHS, and the only thing i remembered of it was that i loved it... oh and the whole snowballing thing! but this is a very funny dig at pop culture, so watch and enjoy!

B0002V7OI8|4.0|_ending spoiler_<br /><br />Forget the recent, forgettable cataclysmic films like The Day After Tomorrow or The Core, or this film's '98 summer rival Armageddon, Deep Impact proves to be powerful and moving, as well as intensely terrifying in its realism. You won't see many films of this nature that don't substitute special effects for a substantial storyline or characters. This isn't so much a disaster film as it is a human drama. The characters are played with depth, their interactions between each other seem realistic in the event that something like this were to happen.<br />I hear people talk about this movie being cheesey. Well, these people must have somehow missed a showing of Armageddon or any other disaster movie that has come out since then. Armageddon had a complete bogus storyline about oil drillers who are sent to blow up a comet. Give me a break. At least in Deep Impact they were certified astronauts and they failed the first time they tried to blow the comet up, as well as the government who also failed with trying divert the comet with ground missiles. That's what I liked about Deep Impact, it was so much more real than any of those other films, and it wasn't hard to place myself into this situation and imagine what it would be like for me and my family and what we would do. And isn't that the point of disaster films?<br />So if you go to disaster movies soley on the fact that you want to see some shiz knocked down or blown up and people in peril, go watch one of those other crappy movies I mentioned before, but if you want to see a truly down-to-earth (no pun intended), realistic and emotionally heartfelt movie about the test of the human spirit through an insurmountable problem, Deep Impact is for you.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|If you do not own Ghostbusters on DVD this is the way to go.  Ghostbusters is a great film.  Regardless of past releases I think you should get this one anyway its very low priced which is great for two great movies.  Its like 12 dollars in some places here on Amazon its like only 13 something it is defintely worth buying for the price especially uif you do not won the previous dvd releases.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is the best album that I heard when I was young.Is a classic through the time.
0790740443|5.0|My husband and I watched this show about fifty times for the past few years, or more before we actually bought it.  We would have purchased it sooner but couln't find it in the stores; now we purchase almost all of our movies from Amazon; almost.  I liked the building of the plot; how someone so tough and brainwashed by his superiors became close to being gentle and caring and a protector for the innocent and un-military type; the later fits me even though I do go to the shooting range.  I liked the part of \\"If it isn't broken, don't try to fix it\\" watch the movie to see what it pertains to.  If this DVD ever goes bad, I will purchase it again.  The beginning might be rough for those that don't like violence; but building this type of story-line is important, the point they are trying to create; but hold on to your hats.  I am looking for a part-two, if ever.  As long as they don't mess it up like most sequels.  Everyone has a point-of view; watch and most will grip.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This CD just kept going and going. The audience was alive with excitement that motivated the Eagles and viewers alike to want more and more. A 5 plus work of art for any Eagles fan. You WON'T be disappointed.

0380725398|5.0|The poetic language and tasteful suspense makes Jamaica Inn and Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier two of my favorite books. Jamaica Inn is a brilliant story, made even more mysterious by Tori Amos' song of the same name. It was her song about the book that made me seek out books by DuMaurier and once again Tori is genius. This was one of the best books I have ever read. Both the book and the song reveal the complexities and horrors of human behavior. DuMaurier also has a rich knowledge of the English countryside and uses fantastic imagery to transport the reader to the moors of Southern England.
0007165013|5.0|I loved this book, it's written in such an original way. The story is amazing that two people can remain best friends for so many years even though they're seperated by an ocean. I love it, absoultely love it!!
B0009YA37W|5.0|I know alot of people are thinking, yes they sound kinda like Intepol, which is one of the reason I like them so much. This is such a well put together album. I would love to hear more from this band in the future!!!
B00003CXB4|3.0|I purchased this movie for my son who is 3.  For some reason he is not that interested in it..  I don't know if it's because there is more singing than in his other movies or what.  He loves The Land Before Time and Finding Nemo but this one falls flat.  Maybe he just needs to be a little older... hopefully that is the case because this is a good movie.  Might need an older audience though..
0143034901|5.0|Great story,written in the traditional lyrical style of Spanish authors. Easy to read even though it contains complex plots. Holds your interest, the type of book you never want to put down. Keeps you reading well past your bedtime!
0930289528|5.0|I thought this book was supercool. I didnt expect much when I bought it ,but it really blew my mind. Alan Moore really know how to make great stories. If you like watchmen, Sandman, Preacher etc. you will love this. I was a little off with the pencil work, but I got used to it in a while. What I mean is this book is old, and therefore the drawings are not of such a quality as preacher for exapmle. I had the same \\"problem\\" with the sandman series, but when the stories are good It dosent really matter how the artwork is. V for Vendetta is truly a great book, it really makes you think. Get it today!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I believe this was the funniest movie that was ever made. I think michael moore is a terrible film maker. he was so funny in it. the movie was like \\"bush's family once owned an oil company soo the war must be about oil....dun dun dun!\\" it was hilarious. and the part where the arab guy was sayin that the reporters husband must have a hard time with you almost made me pee my pants. <br />i am very conservative and rented this movie to to see what he had to say. but it was so ridiculous and it made me even more conservative...but this is what makes our country so great...being able to argue about such things...i also believe that this film disgraced and exploited our military men and women...and having 3 very close cousins in iraq (had four but he was killed)...i found that very offending...i would like to see michael moore go and interview my aunt...she wouldnt be none too kind to him...bottom line...if you're lookin for a good laugh...watch it
B0002OERI0|5.0|Another great CD from Green Day. Definitely not disappointing and done in the style that can only be Green Day. Highly recommend this one.
0140177396|3.0|Of Mice and Men (By. John Steinbeck) Reader Review <br />Reviewer: Abigail Ronco <br /> <br /> The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck begins with two men walking towards a farm down a long dusty Californian road. One, George, is \\"short with dark features\\"; his opposite is a giant of a man with a \\"shapeless face\\" by the name of Lennie. Steinbeck set this story in America, during the Great Depression. In a third person point of view, this novel intertwines the lives of two men who share something more than just meals together with the lives of people on this Californian farm. Together their future is shaped by a golden dream, dastardly deeds, and accidents.  <br /> The characters in Of Mice and Men appeal to the time they have been written into. As you see the story progressing you realize these men have retreated into themselves because they are alone. Without companionship these male humans lose feeling. In America today we are becoming materialistic, will retreating into physical objects subject us to losing feelings just as the people in this time period did? Will we be alone by choice? I bet that if George didn't have Lennie he would have become an empty shell just as the other men had become. <br /> Of Mice and Men's plot is centered around George and Lennie, two men striving to survive during the Great Depression of America on a California farm. Other people then get caught up in George and Lennie's affairs. The situation accidentally triggers a rockslide that changes the people's lives forcefully.  <br /> The style that John writes in is a descriptive one. His work can also be a little dry because of lack of action throughout the storyline. Through the entire book John seemed to get a kick out of eluding and teasing the inquisitive mind. Told from a 3rd person view of George and Lennie, Of Mice and Men doesn't get into the inner workings of their minds but brushes the surface by describing fears, likes, dislikes, and their reactions while living on the farm. <br /> While reading this novel I saw that there were many underlying messages and one seemed to stick out the most to me. That one was Candy's dog being shot in the head to put it out of misery. The message was, that once you are no longer useful to society, you become a burden that needs to be gotten rid of. If you read in between the lines you can foretell some of the events or a general idea or feeling that there is something that will happen. I think this way of writing nudges the reader to react to the mental challenge, creating a splendid work of art rather than just a book.  <br /> Overall...John Steinbeck's creation Of Mice and Men is one of splendid perception that more people of our time should engage in reading. <br />  <br />
0887307280|5.0|Outstanding! This is a must read for anyone who is even dreaming about starting their own business and for those who have already started.
B0006U4UAU|5.0|It took me about 3 full weeks of playing the first CD before I even realized there was a second CD.  The first CD's tracks \\"Tribulations\\", \\"Daft Punk is Playing in My House\\" are fantastic, sing at the top of your lungs while driving, dance songs, while \\"Too much Love\\", and \\"Never as when I'm waking up\\" are pretty and clever chill out songs.   <br /> <br />When I finally played the second disc, I was entranced.  I know-the super cool have had these songs on .mp3 for a year, but not me.  \\"Losing my Edge\\" has got to be my favorite track of the year so far.  Experimental and fresh, it laughs at itself even as it demonstrates it virtuosity in evoking, and reinvigorating the exact experimental rhythms  he uses to poke fun at himself.  <br /> <br />And the lyrics are funny, not pretentious.  I couldn't help myself from laughing out loud when I heard the line  <br /> <br />\\"I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody. Every great song by the Beach Boys. All the underground hits. All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagra record on German import. I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87. I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s.\\"   <br /> <br />It's only funny if you've ever found yourself really coveting that weird import box-set from 1982 that's bidding rediculously high on ebay.  This is an album for all those bidders.
0385334206|3.0|It is not popular art, so it isn't meant to appeal to everyone.  It didn't paricularaly speak to me, which doesn't make it bad art, but it doesn't make it good art either.  It really seems (by Vonnegut's outright admission) to be written largely for the author's own benefit.  The problem with believing that is you're never quite sure when to take Vonnegut at face value.  That is a lot of the fun of Vonnegut; reading his books puts you into a state of uncertainty that is unfamiliar and stimulating - it's also disquieting. <br /> <br />Vonnegut has said this isn't one of his favorite novels he wrote.  It isn't one of my favorite Vonnegut novels either.  That said, it gives you an interesting glimpse into the mind of a disturbed genius.
1577312082|1.0|Have you ever had a Doctor talk to you in Medicalese? He drones on with a lot of high tech talk with medical terminology using words he knows that you can't follow the meaning of as he is more interested in sounding smart than really truly explaining anything to you. Ever run in to one of those types? Ever have a Math teacher who is more into his own ego and rattles on sounding all intelligent but never really teaches? Or how about when a reporter asks a politician what he is going to do if elected and the politician uses all kinds of pretty propagandist words spouting off semantics that beat around the bush but never directly answer the question? Usually those politicians all sound so wonderful. They say things like peace and love and \\"God bless America\\". Yet, in the end you are left scratching your head never learning nothing from their interview. This is what Eckhart Tolle does with his book. He is a master manipulator of words and in sounding like a pious guru master. He refers to himself as a spiritual teacher. What he doesn't understand is that teaching is not impressing, but rather expressing. It's not the people who sound smart but say nothing who are intelligent teachers. The smartest teachers in the world are those intelligent people who can simplify so that we can actually come away having learned something. You learn nothing from this book other than this guy, who talks a lot about getting rid of ego, has way too much of it. You must concentrate on nothingness because in the nothingness is all that is for by concentrating on something your thoughts are blocking the inner joy from the body but only by being in the body can consciousness be out of the body but we are the body and we are all connected to joy and love and peace, bla, bla, bla. If you are gullible and like hearing pretty sounding words that do absolutely nothing for you then get this book. If not, you might find yourself yelling at the author saying, \\"Speak English Dude!! I need an aspirin asyour making my head want to explode\\". <br /> <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|You are in for a wild ride with this bullet ridden, gory, riotously funny and politically absolutely uncorrect puppetshow, where a gung-ho team of tough-as-nails cops seriously kicks the butts of terrorists and their celebrity supporters. Trey PARKER and Matt STONE, the men behind the infamous SOUTH PARK animated TV series, have created a true masterpiece, which can be enjoyed on a variety of levels. <br />Yes, there is lots of very rude humour - all stories you have heard or read about are true. There is indeed an XXX rated sex scene in it (surprisingly graphic, and while watching it was easy for me to see why this particular scene had to be recut several times in order to avoid a NC-17 rating for the movie's theatrical release; this DVD however is the uncut version and so a warning is possibly in order: some brief parts of that scene are of a nasty nature, yes, even though it is with puppets). And the dialogue is so over the top explicitly offensive, there is an almost poetic quality to it. <br />What struck me most however was how much effort went into TEAM AMERICA. Clearly a work of love of all involved, the movie and its \\"characters\\" never look cheap. There are lots of very large and incredibly detailed miniature sets (my favorite being KIM Jong-Il's palace). In fact the film has the look and feel of a multi-million dollar action extravaganza. And granted, you will love the puppet characters. Not only are they exceptionally well characterized (you will even find yourself rooting for KIM Jong-Il, when he croons his \\"I'm so ronery\\" song), their acting (so to speak) is very convincing. These puppets have facial expressions (the filmmakers used animatronic devices to move lips, eyes and eyebrows) and lip movements match the dialogue. In fact, there are not so few real life actors, whose acting is more wooden than that of those puppets. <br />Dialogue is also great. Granted, there are some weak jokes (e.g. KIM Jong-Il having difficulties pronouncing \\"inevitable\\" anda returning gag to the effect of \\"It will be 9/11 hundredfold.\\" - \\"That's 9100.\\"), but the movie is full of memorable lines, my favorites being \\"I've got five terrorists going southeast on Bakalakadaka-Street!\\" and \\"Hey terrorist! Terrorize this!\\", followed by a lethal bullet. The excellent soundtrack adds immensly to the fun - the aggressive \\"America! F**k yeah!\\" team hymn, a nice country ballad appropriately titled \\"Freedom isn't free\\", the aforementioned \\"I'm so ronery\\" and a self-referential one called \\"Montage\\" (acccompanying a ...well, montage of puppet character Gary during shooting and martial arts practice), to name but the best. <br />I mentioned earlier that TEAM AMERICA can be enjoyed on a variety of levels. First of all it is a fine action comedy in itself. You will also have fun guessing all the various movie references, which range from James BOND flicks, the 1960ies THUNDERBIRDS TV series, big budget actioners of the Jerry BRUCKHEIMER variety to KILL BILL VOL 1.  <br />Unsurprisingly, in a movie concerning the war on terror, there is a political subtext. Sure, one could argue that is nonsense in the given puppet context, but I think otherwise. There are a few scenes which are definitely not funny, but rather frightening and moving (e.g. the floating \\"corpses\\" after the attack on the Panama Canal). We also see the leader of a rogue state harbouring and arming terrorists and - like in real life -the UN is a powerless papertiger (cf. the dialogue before UN weapons inspector Hans BLIX is fed to the sharks). Contrary to what many critics wrote about TEAM AMERICA the film does not ridicule the war on terror - on the contrary. Amidst all the puppet violence and sex, the fun and the jokes (and despite the abundant collateral damage TEAM AMERICA creates) the movie clearly shows that the war on terror is worth fighting. <br />TEAM AMERICA is presented in an outstanding DVD edition, excellent in all technical aspects and loaded with great extra features. The making-of featurettes are among the best I have ever seen. It is hugely interesting how they built the large sets, designed the puppets, made the costumes, operated the marionettes and did the impressive stunts (one featurette is about the miniature pyrotechnics). It took lots of research for many aspects, particularly for the interior of KIM Jong-Il's palace. Trey PARKER and Matt STONE comment on their movie. In my view they both seem even now a bit surprised how their project evolved and became bigger and more elaborated as they went along with the film. And again, it is amazing how much effort went into the movie. For instance, the prop man had to create four different designs of the glasses the KIM Jong-Il puppet wears! <br />There are also some deleted scenes (I really wonder why they did not enclude the martial arts fight between Gary and the North Korean soldiers in the final cut of the movie, as it looks very cool) and animated storyboards. Two trailers of the film are present as well, as are three for other releases (the LONGEST YARD remake, COACH CARTER and the fifth SOUTH PARK season). <br />Do yourself a favour and buy this DVD! You will want to watch it over and over again!
B00082IJ08|5.0|This is one of those albums that kind of becomes your soundtrack. It's great.
B000001Y79|5.0|If you are hestitating on whether to buy this CD or not, I say you definitely should. Take away all the hype and it's just plain good anyway. The hits are rightfully hits, but the lesser known songs are worth mentioning. i've never liked all the songs on a cd and on this one i skip world go 'round and sixteen.    if you are first buying the cd now, rather than when it came now, it makes a good introduction to ska. since this isn't entirely ska,  it eases you into a great genre of music. it's relatively cheerful and polished, but it's not pop fluff. not only is ska music in general ridiculously catchy and refreshing, but with No Doubt, you have a superior band that can blend their original influences with several different genres, the lyrics are creative and inspired, and Gwen has a unique voice and charisma like no other.
1577314808|4.0|I was so pleasantly surprised on reading this book.  It was everything I needed to hear
B00005AXEL|5.0|I've never really listened to Stevie Nicks or Fleetwood Mac at all. I'm relatively young, so I've never been exposed to it, but I happened to be randomly exploring music and I listened to the samples, and it sounded good. I wasn't disappointed. It was much better than I thought. I guess I'm pretty nitpicky too. I've never had a CD where I like every single song. The song has to be one that I will frequent alot. Sorry if the songs are out of order here. <br /> <br />1) Trouble in Shangri-La: This is really good. The chorus is catchy, almost too catchy, you know? but I love the songs. The sample of this song caught my attention and made me have to have it. <br />2) Candlebright: This song is odd, just the structure. But it's enchanting, and very good. <br />3) Sorcerer: This might be my favorite. Listen too it loudly. It has a certain swagger. No that's not really the word. It has something, and it's wonderful. GREAT. <br />4) Planets of the Universe: There is alot of good things to be said about this song, but also some negatives. It's not one of my favorites. Just didn't catch on. The lyrics are very nice, I don't know, it just tries too hard, if I am extra critical. It's good, though. <br />5) Everyday: Lovely. Sounds very Sheryl Crow, mainstream, maybe that I've heard it before. But it's so good. Her voice adds so much depth. I love this song! <br />6) That Made Me Stronger: One of my favorites. Interesting song. I can see people finding it not very good, but I think it's really great. Very catchy.  <br />7) It's only love: this song is heartbreaking. Her voice makes it sound so sincere. It's an interesting song.  <br />8) Love Changes: My first reaction was that it seemed different than anything on the CD. It seems like she's really open to different styles. I can't help but like it. <br />9) I Miss You: This really sounds like a song I've heard, I just can't place it. But whatever it is, it's great. second favorite.  <br />10) bombay sapphires: Don't like it. ithink the intro raised my expectations too high.  <br />11) Fall From Grace: rocks hard.  <br />12) Love Is: not a fan of this ballad. a little too corny for me. <br />13) Too Far From Texas: kind of altish-country. I think it's pretty great. Her and natalie maines sound really good together. one of the best.  <br /> <br />Altogether, it's one of the awesomest CDs I've owned. Maybe the best. I'm a tightwad, too, so I get kinda mad if the CD is not up to par. sometimes that happens. but go out and get this one!
0440237688|5.0|This was suggested reading when I was in the 6th grade but I refused to read it because my best friend kept raving about how great it was and I can be that way sometimes.  But when I was a sophmore I picked it up in the library one day and couldnt put it down.  If you dont have even a small life altering moment when you read this, you must be a very cold and angry person.  So much of this book applies to our world today in such a powerful way I really wish some of our politicians and leaders would pick it up.  I HIGHLY suggest every child read this as soon as they can handle the reading level (which isnt high), and I would hope that adults would read it as well.  Some life lessons span beyond age groups.  I'd say its the 1984 for kids, with a few new lessons as well.
B000002J27|5.0|An innovative, contemplative album of high art from a group of talented musicians at the peak of their creative powers.  A major force when released in 1976, \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" is ripe with themes and mysticism.  Exploring belief, sense of self, family, love, life and hope, the album is an artistic and intellectual feast.  Themes that are most important, especially in these days of turmoil. \\"Squonk,\\" \\"A Trick of the Tail,\\" and \\"Mad Man Moon\\" are favourites.   Well crafted, relevant lyrics and music make this offering well worth your time and money.
B000059XUP|4.0|After he and his son, Danny, are brutally murdered, Ashe Corven is resurrected by the \\"mystical\\" crow in order to avenge the slayings. He is transformed into \\"The Crow\\" by Sarah, now all grown up and living in L.A. She paints his face to match that of her first Crow, Eric Draven, and sets Ashe on his path to avenge his son and himself and reunite with Danny in death.  <br /> <br />I'm one of the many Crow fans who actually liked the second movie. I thought the visuals were amazing. The colors of the city popped when they needed to and faded into the background when they needed to. The soundtrack was a mish-mosh of artists but the styles of all of the artists blended perfectly with the style of the movie.  <br /> <br />Vincent Perez was great as the grieving father. Ashe wasn't supposed to be another Eric Draven, he is another character all by himself. Stop comparing him to Eric Draven and Brandon Lee!!!  <br /> <br />Mia Kirshner was pretty good as an all grown up Sarah. Sarah had alot of crap happen to her, as we saw in the first movie. My only issue is that sometimes she has an \\"I'm so goth I'm dead\\" complex but that's her style of acting (check out the L-word if you don't believe me). If you read the comics it goes a little more into her character, not much, but enough. <br /> <br />This movie is an entirely different entity from the first movie. I love the first movie and hate that Brandon Lee will never know the acclaim he deserves for his last work, but don't hate the second movie out of principle. Watch the movie as if it was the only Crow movie to ever be made and then read the comic and you'll get a better understanding of the story as a whole as well as an appriciation for the hard job it was to create a sequel to a movie with the legacy left by the original. Plus a few plot holes and subplots may get cleared up, like that whole Ashe loves Sarah thing. <br /> <br />Don't listen to reviews of the movie by other people, including my own, watch the movie andmake up your own mind. Remember that the movie isn't really a sequel, it's just another story in a franchise. Kind of like the comics. <br /> <br />
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is the best mix of Pink Floyd yet.....I'm so glad I purchased it!!  I encourage any Pink Floyd fan to buy this CD!!
B0002IQJUK|4.0|I bought this CD because it has the studio release and live versins of the same songs.  Why not!  They are both good.  It really depends on my mood as to which one I would like better.  I bought the CD for only 1 song and I have found there are at least 3 others that are equally as good.  What a nice surprise.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm planning on not writing a lot because I can write a book about this woman's cd. I believe Christina has gained her respect back by everyone. From the hip hop community and the pop. This girl can sing her brains out. She is the next best thing \\"in our generation.\\" This girl can blow. Her cd is mixed with everything. Literally everything! Any peticular music you listen to she has it on this cd. That's why it contains 20 tracks. Not too many people can pull off what she did with this disc. Meaning have different kinds of grooves. She released 5 videos, more than any artist can do for one cd. She went on tour. All her songs were hits. It would be very hard for her to top this cd. It came out 2002 now it's 2005 and it still is making sells. Dirrty shouldn't never been a big deal. The girl can dance, and she got her own unique style. The song is crazy, good. Really. I wanna know what was all the fuss about. Any body can have peircngs. And it's not on her vagina neither! She is not a freak, she's just doing her thang. Trust me the girl got boundries. Just listen to can't hold us down. Dirrty was a fantastic video. I love christina she's getting married this year and is coming out with a new cd. I have to get ready for this one. This woman can bring anything. She has been working on it for 3 years now. I hope her boyfriend can handle her because he look like a prune! Go christina!!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|What excellent type of group performance and their music still sounds awesome too!  I've been an \\"EAGLES'S Fan\\" off and on, however, in experiencing the spine tingling, arms' hairs-on-end, feeling of this stellar group's performance, I am definite hooked for \\"The Long Run\\"!  Don Henley is great, as usual, in his singing and drums.  Glen Frey is still awesome.  Timothy Schmidt is excellent in his playing and vocals, and specially in the two (2) songs he sings lead.  Don Felder's guitar is NOT missed at all because of Steuart Smith's identical reproduction, when called on!  What a professional job in Smith's performance!  Joe Walsh is exceptional in voice and funny character, but specially with his guitar picking. <br /> <br />This Tour I, as captured in this DVD, is a magical event for posterity.  I wish that the music tracks for this DVD, and specially because of the newer songs performed, could be made available in CD version. <br /> <br />This DVD is much better than \\"Hell Freezes Over\\", by far.  I guess that now with several \\"live\\" performances under their belts after their initial get-together, the group has once again found their \\"click\\".  We, as EAGLES fans, can only benefit tenfold by their continued performances and professionalism of trade. <br /> <br />OVERALL: This Tour I is a great documention of a \\"live\\" event in Melbourne, Australia, performed by gifted perfectionists who cry their hearts out in their music, and in their group performance.  The EAGLES are still soaring high, with no apparent downdraft to worry about.  This is for-sure 1970's music at its extreme best .......... in the 21st Century!
B00008PW2D|3.0|After watching the 5th season of Sex and the City, I believe it's the worst of the six. There's very little substantive character development, if any.  Carrie's self-involvement reaches epic proportions. The fifth season's strongest attribute is that it's the shortest season.
B0002VEX7S|5.0|i absolutely adore this cd. loreena mckennit has a beautiful way of singing and she completely draws you into the music. i cannot say enough good things about her music. i do know that you will not be sorry for buying it.
0975991477|4.0|Great information and insights of cellular biology from a Ph.D in the field.  Doug's life experiences were not key to his development of this theory, but they were fun reading in the midst of biological information. I truly enjoyed the work and his processing in a way that is of value to all readers, New Agers, seekers of truth and scientists.
B000002GHH|4.0|Hiatt is in fine voice and he's backed by the amazing Ry Cooder on tasty guitar, Nick Lowe playing solid bass and last but certainly not least the incomparable Jim Keltner on drums.  The band is outstanding, playing restrained and supportive, but as much a cohesive unit as any group that Hiatt's played with.  The song's are interesting, mature and provide a nice variety within the soul/country/rock genre.  You might be familiar with \\"A Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" which was a hit for Bonnie Raitt but the other tunes are equally fine on a cd which maintains excellence from start to finish and rates a solid 4+ stars
B0009K7RES|5.0|Para todos los amantes de la msica de Mark Knopfler es un disco esencial. Se trata de varios temas del 'Shangri-La' pero tocados en directo en los estudios de dicho nombre. Es una joya por las versiones de dichos temas. Tambin destaca la versin que hace de 'Rdiger', tama procedente de su disco 'Golden Heart'. Su sonido es muy bueno.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|After seeing all the reviews saying how bad this album sucks, how they \\"sold out\\", how letting Daron sing was a bad idea, i had to write a review.    First off, i own all SOAD's CDs. I admit, they have changed since their self-titled album, they have changed since Toxicity. But sometimes change is good. Some of the people complaining about how SOAD changed for the worse, would be the same people that would complain if they didn't change anything in their music at all. I think it was a good idea for them to try something a little different here. I don't mind Daron's singing, but i would prefer Serj being in control. I'm not going to do a rating on each song, but i will say that I can pop this CD into my player and listen to it all the way through. The only problem I have with this CD is that its too short. After a few listens, it left me craving for more. The cd is so fast-paced, at the end of \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", I was saying \\"Is it over already?\\".     If your a SOAD fan, i would highly recommend this cd to add to your collection. If your not a fan and are curious about this cd, download a few songs and base your idea on that. SOAD is an \\"aquired taste\\", you either like them or you dont. They are a little strange at some points. Sometimes i still find myself asking \\"What did they just say?\\"    Overall, this is a great cd.
B000002HRE|5.0|I know that Reload is different than Ride The Lightning, Metallica, ...And Justice For All, and Master of Puppets, but give it a chance!  There is some real good music here!  I would say to all the Metallica fans out there who would like a change of pace, pick up Load and Reload.  Different, but good.  If you want heavier music, then pick up the other titles I just mentioned.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Okay, I see all of these reviews from old people regarding how Michael Buble is a wannabe Frank Sinatra (who the heck is that?? - is what many teenagers will ask themselves!)  Point is, our parents don't want us to listen to Marilyn Manson or Gangsta Rap.  Here comes a young guy with music that truly is something different or new to teenagers and you get people that just trash on it.  Wrong!  Give a cd with a photo of an old man (Sinatra, Davis Jr, etc) to a teenager and they will throw it back at you. <br /> <br />Michael Buble is young and new to me! I like his voice and his music.  All are great songs on this cd, but my favorites are \\"Feeling Good\\", \\"Quando, Quando?\\" (duet with Nelly Furtado), and \\"You don't know me\\".  Everyone has their favorites.  One of the reviews called michael's renditions whinny and a parody.  Wait, haven't many rappers taken old classic songs and added bad words to them? Hmmm, I wonder what is best for people to listen too? You choose.  Michael has a nice clean tone to his voice.  This cd has a good variety of RE-MADE classics that do justice to the old versions (which I have checked out!). <br /> <br />To end this review; If you like jazzy, mellow music, or big band tunes, check this CD out.  It is great!  I downloaded the whole cd for 10 bucks.  Go out and get it!  - 19 year old KID
B000003TAR|5.0|I would say that In Utero is essential Nirvana, but so are a few other albums from them.  If you like Nirvana, you should have this album, Nevermind, and Unplugged in New York.  That should be enough excellent Nirvana music to keep you satisfied.
B000060OFT|1.0|I saw this film laughing until the end because of how ridiculous it is. No one talks like that in the 21st century. Especially not in L.A!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust in Peace is a great album.  I have six other Megadeth albums and am not disappointed with any of them. My favorite is Youthanasia, but I also really like this one.  If you can afford it and like Megadeth's style, I would say pick up as much Megadeth as you can, as I did.  I don't think a bad album from Megadeth exists.  I am pleased with my purchases, and you probably will be too!
B000002H97|5.0|In the DVD version, Metallica explains that they had no idea this album would sell so many copies. So I don't know why people are calling it the \\"commercial\\" album, because it's not. And besides, if Metallica felt good enough to release this album, then that's what's important. And Nothing Else Matters!
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Countdown to Extinction is a great album. I have six other Megadeth albums and am not disappointed with any of them. My favorite is Youthanasia, but I also really like this one. If you can afford it and like Megadeth's style, I would say pick up as much Megadeth as you can, as I did. I don't think a bad album from Megadeth exists. I am pleased with my purchases, and you probably will be too! <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|One doesn't really know how much a musical can elevate your spirits until the music from \\"Wicked\\" is enjoyed.  The unique female duets are almost overpowering.  When one hears and sees (if you are lucky enough to get a ticket) some of the numbers from this outstanding musical you want to stand and cheer (as many have done). <br /> <br />This album is a must for any Broadway Music fan.  Definitely ear candy.
B000002HMH|5.0|This album is not the same as their previous albums, but after such masterpieces as Metallica, ...And Justice For All, Ride The Lightning, and Master of Puppets, where were they gonna go?  This album represents a fundamental change in Metallica's style, but it by no means makes this a bad album.  If you like this album, pick up Reload as well.  They have the same vibe.
0792846443|5.0|This is simply a fantastic psychological thriller that everyone will enjoy. It is based on the best selling book by Stephen King and really does do it justice. <br />Kathy Bates' performance as the crazed Annie Wilkes is absolutely stunning and really gives the film that 5* rating. She deserved the oscar! <br />Not only is this film scary, its fun in a strange way. You really feel like you are in there trapped with no means of escape. This is pure cinema and entertainment in its highest possible form! Watch it, you'll be pleased you did.
B000000OUE|5.0|You gotta dig Rob Zombie's voice.  It is like nothing else.  A Heavy Metal collection is incomplete without White Zombie.  I have Supersexy Swingin' Sounds and La Sexorcisto in addition to Astro Creep: 2000, all of which I like very much.  Pick up at least one of those titles.  This album does rock significantly.
B00003CXCT|5.0|We thought the remastered editions of Episodes IV-VI were fabulous! Not only were the films clearer and sharper than they ever were, the subtle additions of deleted scenes made the whole re-seeing all that much more spectacular. My husband and I saw the originals when they first hit the theaters over 27 years ago. It was great to see them restored so well. We especially loved the end of Eps. VI where Hayden C. was placed next to Yoda & Obi-Wan in spirit form. It just made the melding of Eps. I-III with IV-VI all the more complete.
B000003TA4|5.0|I would say that Nevermind is essential Nirvana, but so are a few other albums from them.  If you like Nirvana, get this album, In Utero, and Unplugged in New York.  That should be enough excellent Nirvana music to keep you satisfied.
0894803123|5.0|This is a wonderful book, not only are the recipes easy to follow but the background info about Ben and Jerry is interesting and fun to read.  Every recipe I've tried has turned out exactly right.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is Nu-Metal at its best. Nearly every track is a good song. Get this and Hybrid Theory to enhance your music collection. Hybrid Theory is equally good. <br />
1881273156|5.0|I found the book very easy to read and very informative.  It definitely helped me identify my husbands love language and what I need to do to make sure his love tank is full.  The book proved a good talking point for us and is something I am sure will help us improve our marriage.  I am now looking at buying the book specific to childrens love languages so that I can be sure to be communicating in my son's love language too!
B000089RVX|5.0|This album touches places within me that yearn for attention, but places that rarely get any.  Fallen is my antidote.  Every song speaks to me in a special way.  I really feel Amy Lee's lyrics, and she has the vocal expertise to send the message home.  Marvelous job on this album guys, every track is a winner.  May we have another?
B00030EIXW|5.0|Thanks to documents like this, Carlos Kleiber's incomparable art will live on into the future and/or as long as great music itself lives on.  --Years ago, this pairing on VHS was my introduction to Carlos Kleiber \\"live.\\"  Over time, the tape stretched a bit, and both sound and picture suffered in those spots.  The digital processing on the DVD for both audio and video is world-class, and now these performances virtually jump off the screen into your lap!  What a loss this man's self-imposed retirement was to music lovers the world over. And, with his death in July 2004, he's truly lost to the world for all time.  <br />I'm saving up to get the rest of Kleiber's \\"new\\" DGG DVDs  while I still can.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I have three other Pantera albums, Far Beyond Driven, Vulgar Display of Power, and The Great Southern Trendkill.  They are all great, but Cowboys From Hell is my favorite.  If you are new to Pantera, but you like Metal, definitely get this album.  If you like it as much as I think you will, get the other three that I mentioned.  Then you will have yourself a nice little Metal collection.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|If you love this film, and own either an \\"official\\" VHS issue or an off-the-air taping, forget about it and order this DVD now, before the supply is gone.  The stunning imagery that enthralled you before is seen in its true glory in the DVD transfer--and it won't fade or blur as the tape does--and will. I couldn't be happier with this disc!
B0002EXH54|5.0|Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? is a great album. I have six other Megadeth albums and am not disappointed with any of them. My favorite is Youthanasia, but I also really like this one. If you can afford it and like Megadeth's style, I would say pick up as much Megadeth as you can, as I did. I don't think a bad album from Megadeth exists. I am pleased with my purchases, and you probably will be too! <br />
0783240287|5.0|I have throughly enjoyed seeing this production of ALW.  The cast is suburb, with Donny Osmond in the role he played for so many years in a traveling company of the show.  My one small problem with this edition, is the risque costuming of some of the women, Joan Collins and her egyptian retinue in particular.I watched it with my grandaugthers and they thought these people were naked ,that took some explaining.  They loved the music, and had seen a local high school production, so they really were into \\"Joseph\\" etc. Since this production is staged as a program at a school,I think these costumes were out of place. Everthing else was outstanding!
B0002EXH4A|5.0|So Far, So Good...So What! is a great album. I have six other Megadeth albums and am not disappointed with any of them. My favorite is Youthanasia, but I also really like this one. If you can afford it and like Megadeth's style, I would say pick up as much Megadeth as you can, as I did. I don't think a bad album from Megadeth exists. I am pleased with my purchases, and you probably will be too! <br />
B0009K7RES|5.0|All at once: the family-man, contented, better-than-EVER virtuoso Mark Knopfler---along with the 70s and 80s Knopfler of high-energy & of quirky/sexy vocal teasing that all the girls 're-wound' and swooned to over and over again.  What could be better?  A great display that the life-refined Mr. Knopfler has left none of his personality behind.  He says, \\". . . the song is what matters . . . \\" and he makes it so by injecting the fullness of himself into it.  True fans can't afford to miss out on the blended-to-PERFECTION Mark Knopfler of \\"One Take Radio Sessions.\\"  And the girls?  Still soooo jealous:  Kitty's a lucky lady to share the life of this complex and amazing man who exudes poetry from his soul.
B000002GK1|4.0|It starts out strong with the first two tracks, then kind of falls apart.  I don't know what happened with the rest of the album.  There are a few parts that are good, but aside from the first two tracks, good songs are pretty scarce.  I still love Soundgarden though.  I strongly prefer Superunknown to this album.  It is so obviously better than Badmotorfinger.
B000003TA4|2.0|Ignore the hype & media of \\"Nevermind\\", ignore the critics, ignore the radio play, ignore VH1 and Rolling Stone magazine... ignore Kurt Cobain's \\"cool\\" look with his sunglasses and ripped clothes.    BUY Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\"... listen to it, listen to it long and often.. I want you to...    BUY Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\".. listen to it long and often...    And you'll see why, with much less promotion.. and much less commercialism behind the album, Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" sold millions more copies than \\"Nevermind\\"... why?  Because Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" was simply the album with better music.  How else could it of sold more copies if \\"Nevermind\\" had more radio play and music videos?    Ignore the hype, like I said.. and be honest with yourself, if you are honest with yourself, and you are not trying to fit in with the \\"cool\\" kids in high school who pretend to be much more troubled than they are, and listen with both your heart and mind... if you do this with both albums, 9 out of 10 of you will agree Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" is far superior.    I guarantee it... You know no matter how \\"cool\\" you want to be, whenever you hear Pearl Jam's \\"Black\\" on the radio, it hits your heart in a way no song off \\"Nevermind\\" could.    And yes, anyone disagreeing with this review are the people im refering to who try way too hard to be cool.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is Nu-Metal at its best.  Nearly every track is a good song.  Get this and Meteora to enhance your music collection.  Meteora is equally good.
0375758992|4.0|I thought this was a well written and most interesting story.  I love reading sumptuous stories about Africa.  This was definitely from a different perspective...the hard life of Africa about a white family without a lot of resources (wealth) who loves Africa and about the very real difficulties of making farm life work there.  Kind of depressing.  Doesn't make you want to sign up for the next flight to Africa, rather makes you think twice about picking up and heading there.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I have six other Megadeth albums and Youthanasia is my favorite.  It was actually my introduction to Megadeth, and at first I was only interested in a few songs from it.  But later on I realized what a gem I had in my possession.  Each track on this album is great!  If you don't own this album yet, get it.  A must have for Metal fans everywhere.
1932100385|4.0|The China Study is probably the best book available describing the benefits of a plant-based diet.  Dr. Campbell is a solid scientist who found himself driven toward a plant-based diet by the compelling nature of the data produced in his research.  Being neither preachy nor pseudo-spiritual in tone, this book is a gift to anyone wondering about the science behind a vegan diet-especially someone with a critical mind.<br /><br />While the book is built around the results of his many years of research on diet and health, it also tells the fascinating story of a scientist whose beliefs are shaken by what he learns.  In the book, Dr. Campbell takes you on a journey back along the path of scientific data that led him to a 180-degree turn in his views on the value of a plant-based diet.  What I appreciated most was his explanations of what nutritional studies can and cannot tell us, as well as how to sift through the claims of the proponents of fad diets.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Campbell gives a disturbing \\"behind the scenes\\" view of the machinations involved in the development of government nutritional guidelines.  This, in itself, is worth the read.
B000002JR8|5.0|I have three other Pantera albums, Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display of Power, and The Great Southern Trendkill, and like them all very much.  Far Beyond Driven was my third Pantera album, and of course by then, I knew I really liked them.  I think if you are a Heavy Metal fan and like Phil Anselmo's vocals, you will like all of the albums I just mentioned.  So go on and buy yourself one, or all four of these albums.  Enjoy.
B00003CX5P|5.0|For me is very fine and you have all idea for the movie.  Is very good and in dvd.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Will Smith reprises his one-dimensional macho John Wayne role from \\"Independence Day\\" in this science fiction thriller. This movie begins by hinting it will be more than man vs. machine, perhaps with some of the intellect hinted in \\"AI\\", but it ends up being a pretty typical (but high class) action mystery with a typical ending.<br /><br />Briefly stated, the plot revolves around a society 30 years in the future where robots are everywhere and are serving mankind as maids, helpers, cooks, etc. Will Smith is a cop that doesn't trust robots for a couple reasons. In typical Hollywood style, his distrust begins as waywardness and ends as prescience when robot-induced mayhem is quelled in the denouement.<br /><br />This movie gets points for not being as predicatable as it suggests in the opening minutes, not to mention its outstanding production values, good musical score and extremely generous computer-generated scenes of robots, the 2035 city of Chicago and other impressive scenes that surely will generate a lot of visceral affect on wide screen television.<br /><br />Yet, in the final analysis, this is pretty typical stuff for both Smith and Hollywood -- a movie about a cop that seems to know something's wrong when no one else (including Ph.D. scientists, Smith's boss and other geniuses) can see the troubling developments. The action and smart pacing of this flick makes it memorable, but not so memorable that you remember everything about it the next morning.
B00080Z53O|5.0|The sea inside is an outstanding moving film, which touches in a very delicate issue of our contemporary society.  The director succesfully manages to represent the diferent views in society today in regards to such sensitive issue.  On the one hand we can see the love of those who love 'Ramon'and want to give him everything he deserves to have a nice and confortable life, considering the circumstances, and on the other hand we can se the views and thoughts of cold institutions such as governments and religious orders. <br /> <br />Those who love him suffer the pain of having to sacrifice their selfish feelings of wanting Ramon to carry on with his life to let him have his way and respect his will. <br /> <br />The sea inside is indeed one of the most moving films I had the delight of seeing in recent times. <br /> <br />I strongly recomend it <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|It's Dream Theater!!! What else will you espect from the best? <br />They only get better and better. Great album.
068987474X|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for.  I tried things they suggested in the book and they were right on.  It will make you laugh and make you say \\"oh yeah, I remember when a guy did that to me!\\"  It's a great summer read.
B0002WZTPC|5.0|Top Gun is a great movie with everything that you can imagine in it!!!!! It has a great cast of sexy actors like Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, and the talented Kelly McGuils!!!!!! It has planes and what more can i say!!!!! The music from the movie is exciting and very hot!!!!!! Like i said hot music, hot cast, and a great film to watch over and over again!!!!!
0767020308|5.0|Kate Beckinsale is pure delight as Emma, and the entire cast is up to snuff in my opinion. The atmosphere is rich with period effects and the clothing is superb. All in all, a great fun time with a satisfying dose of the elegance and formality which Austen fans should relish.<br /><br />Linore Rose Burkard, author, Before the Season Ends
0440241413|5.0|This book is great for light summer reading.  It captures the mindset of someone who can't resist a gorgeous pair of shoes, or sunglasses, or pants, or... As a self-proclaimed \\"shopaholic\\" myself, I can not only relate to this book, but it also teaches me how NOT to manage my finances once I'm out of college.  Kinsella's portrayal of Rebecca Bloomwood is hilarious, and pretty accurate as well, what with Becky's constant rationalizations about her purchases.  Read this book on vacation, or before school begins again.  It's a quick read, so you'll be done in a couple of days!
1593072937|4.0|I would give it a 5 star rating except this edition's size is smaller and I prefer the original covers better. I much prefer the larger size book - the larger the size, the better the drawings look.
0140288503|5.0|This is a first rate account of one of the most intense military firefights in recent warfare. It reads like suspenseful fiction but is historical fact. While the mistakes relating to our mission in Somolia are clearly  defined the bravery of the men who fought there is the take home message of this book.I highly recommend it even to those who have seen the movie.
0975991477|5.0|This book is a must-read for everyone.  Finally, a scientitst has taken the leap to let people in on the new biology.   The world is so needy for major transformation in thought and practice.  It can only come from the transformation of each individual.  As a chiropractor, I share with my patients how healing comes from within.  Now, I can recommend a book that makes the biology clear to them in a totally understandable fashion.
B000003TAR|3.0|After Nevermind, Nirvana's music seemed to grow whinier and whinier and more and more self-absorbed. I guess this had something to do with the sudden shift in Cobain's priorities(addiction, marriage and parenthood, the pressures of stardom), but I think the main problem was that all of it was sort of new to him, unlike during the recording of Nevermind, when he had grown used to the crappiness of his life and kind of displayed an \\"I don't care anymore\\" attitude, which I thought was a lot classier than the pity potty that is In Utero. Still, there are some good songs on this album, particularly Heart Shaped Box, Dumb, and my personal favorite (after a few listenings), Radio Friendly Unit Shifter. Still, I would have been happier with an album filled with bleach-esque noise than songs approaching such sentimentality.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|After Train of Thought, I was hoping Dream Theater would go back to something that was a little more their style, and \\"Octavarium\\" did not disappoint. The album's sound is definitely different from that of previous Dream Theater albums, yet stylistically the same. Save \\"Scenes from a Memory,\\" this is probably the bands best work. My ONLY complaint about \\"Octavarium\\" (and the only reason I didn't give it five stars) is that for inspiration, DT seemed to borrow very heavily from the band Muse. It's uncanny how similar some of the stuff sounds. But other than that one thing, I love the album and am kind of weirded out with how I can listen to it over and over again and not get tired of it. If you're a DT fan you're going to want to pick this one up.
0975991477|5.0|This book pulls all the scientific information together and makes it readable and understandable for the average reader. <br /> <br />Amazing information and accessible for everyone.  Much to consider and use to create the life that you want!
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This is an excellent CD...Herb Ellis' rhythm guitar is so perfect it's scary...they swing so hard without a drummer that drummers should buy this CD up in self defense.  Oscar and Getz understand each other and their dialogue is rich and thoughtful...today's players don't swing like this...this is good, solid, deeply grooved four-four swing which is a lost art...every rhythm guitar player should listen to Herb Ellis (and Freddie Greene)...what an absolute treat...
B000001FMX|5.0|This albumn did not sell well Upon its' release but has continued to influence countless bands since. When you get past the makeup and stuffed crotches what you have is 5 musicians who are not technically great players but when they come together they make one incredible sound.
B000002GJH|5.0|Been Rockin' a long time. This is one of my very favorites. Anyone in the present past in the wake of the demise of Creed should take a heavy eye'd look at this supermen effort by some of the best rock gods of their generation. In weird ways it reminds me of trying to sleep as a kid with my neighbor playing \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" or my love affair with Robin Trower's \\"Twice Removed from Yesterday\\" OK in spirit only...Sure everything later resonates and even some Zep comparisons but such bluesy style of their own, DAMN! You gotta wonder \\"If I went back and talked to these guys who would they say their influences were?\\". Bad Ass! This album is essentialy beautiful bluesy rock with all of these guys at their creative apex. Not a bad track on this baby. Turn it up and find someone tragic to love preferably in a neon backlit room at sunset.
B0002OERI0|1.0|ANOTHER pop band with 12 year old girl fans that will listen to anything they see on MTV. They were decent when they made Dookie way back when, but god, they've just joined the rest in the pathetic MTV line of bands that you'll never see again in 10 years. <br /> <br />METAL UP YOUR ASS.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Well I just had to say something about this cd. I am not a huge fan of Mariah Carey, however I loved this Cd and I think it is probably her best.  The more you listen the better it gets!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I love this movie.  It has the best blues music in it and the final showdown is fantastic.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Star Trek: Insurrection my not be the best Star Trek movie made but it is definitely not the worst (can you say Star Trek V: The Final Frontier).  As for as the story goes it is a great story and it definitely has a lot of humor, which it always a good thing.  So if you love Star Trek in any form buy this movie.
B000001DTM|5.0|A bold statement to say, but nevertheless this album is incredible.  I grew up with U2 so I am slightly bias.   <br /> <br />This album introduced a new generation of U2 fans into the 1990s.   <br /> <br />While the pre 90s stuff from U2 is still excellent, this album stands out because of the different sound.  For 1991 this was cutting edge. <br />
0790729601|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Governor ) proves in this high action drama that he is capable of protecting the state of terrorists. I on the other hand will protect your investment by advising you that this is a superb dvd for your action collection. Aronld's character John Kruger a U.S Marshal battles his tutor in a quest to prevent super weapons from getting in the wrong hands.This has got to be one of the best action movies I've seen.......I'ts a classic!
B000002J09|5.0|First off, anyone who has given this review anything less than four stars needs to seriously re-evaluate their decision. <br /> <br />This album is phenomenal.  Did I spell that right?  Start to finish whatever the true name of the album is, it rocks. <br /> <br />Granted, alot of the songs are overplayed on the radio and alot of people are sick of 'em, they still rock. <br /> <br />One more thing, if you don't enjoy true classic rock, don't review this album.  A lot of non rockers feel their enlightening the rest of the world by posting a review completley ripping an album because it's not their style of music. <br /> <br />Grow up and find something better to do with your time. <br /> <br />As for the rest of you Zep is the greatest and most influential band of all time! Rock on.
067101756X|5.0|I think that Phillips J Corso is a brilliant man & it takes a great man to step forward to try to smash the cover-ups of our corrupt government. I've talked to a few people about this book, as they were the ones who lead me to read it in the first place. There is more to this book than just what's between the covers, you've got to learn to read between the lines. The book alludes to the Space Shuttle Challenger was blown up by aliens, & also there are codes in the book, if you know numerology. There's one particular phrase in this book, a quote from David Crockett AKA Davy Crockett(Yes, THAT Davy Crockett...think the Alamo) that says \\"Be sure you're right, then go ahead\\" which if you take the number corresponding to each letter & add them together, they make a grid coordinate on the map in the Florida Keys. Forbidden Key is a spot where there have been many UFO sightings in the past 50 years. My friend actually traveled to it, & kayaked around the island & said there were forbidden entry, government warning signs all around it & said when he got back to the boat dock, there was a strange man photographing him. Strange....is there something being covered up at Forbidden Key? Guess you can go for yourself. =) If you're interested in talking about this, my e-mail address is spartanking@myway.com
B000002572|4.0|This album is excellent start to finish.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because few albums are deserving of the 5 star rating.  Despite being an amazing debut it falls just a hair short of being \\"legendary\\".
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I loved the Eagles Farewell 1 Tour DVD.  The songs still sound fabulous, the harmony is better than ever, and all of the guys still look great. I watch it every chance I get!  I highly recommend it to everyone!!
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Here's the skinny: In the 1950's, unconventional Katherine Watson lands a teaching position at the exclusive (and traditional) Wellesley College. Her square-peg-in-a-round-hole approach to teaching art history encourages her students to look at life, and themselves, differently.<br /><br />For the most part, I thought this was a pretty good movie, featuring an impressive cast of young female stars. Gennifer Goodwin as Connie was particularly convincing and lovable, and Maggie Gyllenhall was pitch-perfect as the rebel (and token Jew) in the group of tight-knit friends the movie follows. (Both are star material; mark my words.) All of the actresses look GREAT in this movie; the makeup and hair were particularly convincing. Some of the shots of the college campus are also gorgeous as well.<br /><br />There was one thing that really bothered me about the movie, though. Betty (Kirsten Dunst) spends the whole movie hating Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts). Then, all of a sudden, at the end, she decides she absolutely LOVES her. It made no sense.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fun little chick flick. I don't think it would be on the top of my list for earth-shattering film-making, but it's a good movie for a night in with the girls.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I liked the movie. That's why I ordered it. But when I finally tried to play it, the picture and the sound kept breaking up. I wanted to have it replaced, but I can't find a single way to communicate with anyone who can do anything about it. I can't return in unopened because I had to open it to play it to find out it was defective. It's not the DVD player because I ordered two other DVDs that are just fine. <br /> <br />And yes, I'm over the age of 13. I'm over the age of 65 and can't afford to waste money on a DVD that won't work. You give me no recourse. <br /> <br />Please forward this to a human being who can respond to this.
0312265859|5.0|I have read all of the Stephanie Plum novels and can only say they are some of the funniest books I have ever read.  Every book is a treat, and I only wish Janet Evanovich could write them faster.  I look forward to reading about Stephanie's newest disasters, how many vehicles will be demolished and whether or not she will ever decide between Joe and Ranger (but who wouldn't want both?).  Some would probably call these \\"summer reads\\", but I think they're a great read any season.
B0002GTWQA|5.0|Long, long time ago I bought this movie at very steep price in New York as a VHS tape and was glad to have it all this time, but as regrettable as it may be, all good things come to an end and I threw it.<br /><br />The DVD is far better and has an excellent resolution (also due to the fact that it is presented in Letterbox format) and a wonderfully plastic sound.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole is still in his haydays and looks as young as he did in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br /><br />The story is highly entertaining and adventurous and the movie moves with an elegance seldom seen these days.<br /><br />I won't bother you with details of the story. Everyone who is used to read good books and fine literature, already knows from what novel this movie has been inspired (just look at the title).<br /><br />I can only recommend it as a valid complement to every movie collection that deals with well-made pictures and entertaining stories.<br /><br />On my part, I already cherish this as a tiny jewel in the crown of my own collection.
0375830995|5.0|The narrator Ed is a taxicab driver and kind of a loser. When he's not working, he hangs out with his smelly dog and his loser friends to play cards and drink. Then he captures a bank robber and gets messages from a stranger written on playing cards. As he carries out tasks the messages suggest, he helps strangers, his friends, and eventually himself.<br /><br />The book is funny, and the narrator's voice is sensitive and sweet. His three friends' characters are gradually developed very well. The pacing is great, as the reader, along with Ed, tries to figure out how Ed will carry out the tasks suggested to him and who is behind the messages.<br /><br />The ending is perhaps unnecessarily didactic, but I admire the author for taking the risk.<br /><br />All in all, a funny, moving, thought-provoking read.
B000063V8T|5.0|What can I say about a Series of boxed DVDs of \\"Star Trek - The Next Generation\\".<br /><br />Just this: fantastic!<br /><br />I used to own all the seven Seasons of PAL/VHS tapes and it was already an experience then.<br /><br />But now. Wow!<br /><br />I have bought only 6 of the 7 Seasons up to now and I bought them in NTSC format. Since I own a region free DVD player I have absolutely no problem in viewing them.<br /><br />Some may argue that PAL DVDs are crispier than NTSC ones. Well, uless you are a laser scientist, you may not really notice the difference, and in my own personal experience on DVD there's no difference (given that the source is a pristine one).<br /><br />Also, and in many cases it is true, expecially when we talk of Feature movies, the U.S. versions contain at least a second European language (either French or Spanish, sometimes both, sometimes even a German version is added and if not a dubbed version, then simply a subtilted version), which for people like me, who have guests that may not speak English is a great asset.<br /><br />Star Trek alas, has no such luxury, but each box contains an extra DVD section (usually on the last one, which is crammed with useful and interesting information about the entire Season and about some key episodes within it).<br /><br />Sharpness of the image is there (as it was for the Three Seasons of Star Trek - The Original Series). Excellent color balance and contrast information. Compare it even with PAL VHS tapes and you will see the astonishing difference.<br /><br />Sound on all DVDs, has truly received the royal treatment of Digital Remastering and although the first three seasons were produced in conventional Dolby Stereo (at the time of production this was still the standard), they now sound far more \\"rounded up\\" and crisp with the musical track in Surround. Starting from Season Four, you get to be treated with true 5.1 Surround.<br /><br />I am a fan of Star Trek, but a quiet, objective and sometimes overly criticizing one. Especially when it comes to Enterprise.<br /><br />But believe me when I say that they won't ever make such a Series anymore, unless tendencies will tend to sway from simple \\"money-grabbing-stupid-content\\" back to \\"hard-working-well-written\\" ones again.<br /><br />Even a non-Trekkie or non-Trekker will enjoy at least the first two incarnations of Star Trek.<br /><br />The secret being, that these are far less Science Fiction tales, but rather tales of the human adventure in a possible future.<br /><br />The key being very actual problems with which we are all faced in our daily lives.<br /><br />The Alien factor is often used as a \\"replacement\\" for the \\"racial\\" or \\"social\\" denominator, giving the author a certain freedom to tackle with many crucial and controversial social issues.<br /><br />The result is always a very interesting and gripping \\"voyage\\" into the unknown, space being just part of the decorum.<br /><br />The crews of both \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Star Trek - The Next Generation\\" are all highly talented actors, who bring true life to their characters and to the situations they are involved in.<br /><br />There is also a well-balanced dose of humor in some episodes, which is always helpful in order not to fall into a gloomy pit of self-glorification.<br /><br />Although I haven't yet bought \\"Deep Space Nine\\" or \\"Voyager\\" I may not be able to comment on them, but in view of the fact that they too, have been produced by Paramount, as well as their Feature Movies, I can only assume that the quality may be the same as the ones I already mentioned.<br /><br />The boxes are rather conventional, compared with The Original Series which look like the old Medical Kit in \\"three flavors\\" (Golden Yellow, Medical Blue and Burgundy Red). The Next Generation comes in Silvery Boxes, with differently colored fonts, all coded-colors obviously. They are meant to represent the various professional specializations aboard the Enterprise-D.<br /><br />Once opened, tucked in an internal flip box, this time fully code-colored, are the six to seven DVDs (depending on how many episodes a Season had). Generally three on one side, and another three to four on the other. As said, the last DVD always contains the special presentations and interviews.<br /><br />A booklet containing a brief episode description is also \\"tucked in\\" within a special sleeve.<br /><br />Every DVD contains four episodes.<br /><br />The Menus are very intuitive and divided in theme, by Season.<br /><br />One represents the Command LCARS Console, Two the Engineers LCARS Console, Three the Medical LCARS Console and so forth and so on (mind you, I am citing them by memory, the actual order may elude me now).<br /><br />Anyway and in conclusion, this is truly a worthwile set to buy if you mean to entertain your entire family or just your friends with an intelligent, well-written and well-done bunch of TV episodes of one of the most creative minds Hollywood has ever met, (except of course, for others like Ray Bradbury, Rod Serling or Arthur C.

0975991477|5.0|Thanks for the opportunity. My wife and I have been in one of Bruce Lipton's classes and his material is way ahead of the \\"cutting edge\\". As a business consultant for over 16 yrs, I can recommend this new book as essential for everyone on the planet. The lay person can read this clearly written book and understand and learn and change their lives by the simple truths he has uncovered.   Having only a bachelors degree in psychology I can see where he has had to fight innumerable battles but the truth has prevailed and is now \\"light\\" for the reader. Please market this \\"must read\\" for anyone seeking freedom and satisfaction in their daily walk. Yes, Bruce Lipton, is brilliant but I think the brilliance comes more from what \\"diamonds\\" he uncovered by his tenacity and diligence to find what he knew was and is in his heart. Thanks for the opportunity to thank both Bruce and to you for conveying it to us. <br />Ronald J. Powers
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Includes all the themes and music from what I consider to be the most important moments of season 1. The first time through the disc I enjoyed visualizing the scene from the show. The 20th time through I still enjoy listening to it

B0002VKZL6|5.0|I bought and downloaded this album from the iTunes Music Store. In the first two days, I thought that it was a good effort from Mark Knopfler, but not as good as his Golden Heart album.  <br /> <br />However, and as I started listening more and more to this album, i started to appreciate the great music that it contains. To such an extent that nowadays I listen to it at least every day in my car and at home. It is aboslutely great. Although I enjoy all the songs, my favorites are : The Trawlerman's Song, Back to Tupelo, Shargri-La, the brilliant Everybody Pays, the excellent Postcards from Paraguay and All that Matters, and the fantastic Stand Up Guy and Don't Crash the Ambulance.   <br /> <br />The music is mature, sweet and easy going with some great lyrics in places.  <br /> <br />It has become one of those albums that I cannot imagine my life without it. This may sound to many like a bit too much, but frankly speaking, it is true...

038572179X|4.0|Atonement, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, tells the story of Briony, a precocious 13-year-old girl, with an active imagination and a dream of being a writer.  When her tendency to tell stories spreads to real life, the consequences last the rest of her life. <br /> <br />The story is beautifully woven together, beginning with a pre-war warm summer evening, taking readers through the British retreat, and ending at the cusp of the 21st century.  Despite some incredibly long sentences, McEwan's writing is often striking, especially at the beginning and end of the novel.   <br /> <br />The book is a page turner in the first section, with a shocker at the end of each chapter.  The pace slows in the middle, but then ends with a surprise, weavening the moving story together.  <br /> <br />If the entire book had been as good as the opening and conclusion, it would have been amazing.  As it is, it's a well written and intriguing story, well worth a read.  <br />
B00005OMTT|5.0|I have been a fan of Enema for many years, even before they were a group.  There have been many imitators spawned by Enema but they remain the quintessential new age/ambient group.

B0007M22TI|3.0|I purchased the CD and DVD of this concert. The music is wonderful and varied enough to listen all the way through at one sitting. The DVD has some extra music, but is hard to watch, since the staging of the show was inappropriately done like a rock concert, with rotating spotlights that randomly and continually flash into the camera lens and thus into your eyes. This music and the singers deserve better than this.
B000002AH7|3.0|I remember this music from 30 years ago, but this particular rendition is different from what I remember.  I was not particularly pleased with it.   <br /> <br />If you like Jazz, Sketches of Spain is magnificent, but I think there is a truer form of Miles Davis rendition than this one.

6304331851|4.0|In school, we're doing a lesson on the Medieval times. So, for the project, we watched this 1967 musical on the much told tale of \\"King Arthur\\". I was a little apprehensive at first since it was long in length, but then I gained confidence when I saw that the cast was led by Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, to very fine actors. Well, I watched the movie, and now I shall write a review on it.<br /><br />I'm not going to bore anyone with plot details since anyone who knows the legend of King Arthur and Camelot knows the plot of the movie. What I will focus my review on is the music and the acting. The songs are absolutely fantastic. \\"If Ever I Should Leave You\\" remains a classic, but for me the standout performance was \\"The Lusty Month Of May\\". That song was superb. The rest of the songs were also very good. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the movie. The cast is so so. I felt that Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave took turns carrying the movie, since I couldn't buy Franco Nero's Lancelot. The two stars' talent are on full display, as without the film, this movie would have tedious and unbearable. I also felt the film could have been a lot shorter. I felt that it got drawn out towards the end (by the end, many of us were disappointed by the end) and could have cut out some stuff.<br /><br />Well, 38 years have passed since this film were released, and three things are still abundantly clear:<br /><br />1) The music is still superb.<br /><br />2) Harris and Redgrave still shine.<br /><br />3) It isn't as good as many remember it.<br /><br />I'd really only recommend this movie to fans of the genre of musicals. Otherwise, nobody will find this film very interesting.
0553579908|5.0|Simply put, if you enjoyed the first book in this series, A Game of Thrones, you will enjoy this one as well.      It has all of the great plot, amazing action scenes, clever writing, medieval warefare, and cunning characters as before.  All of the characters are back that weren't killed in the first book, and a few new characters are introduced.      It becomes clear in this book that this series is just getting started.  No progress is made in this book to closing any of its many story lines.  If anything, the story has become bigger.      One interesting thing that looks to be happening is the hint of true fantasy and magic being woven into the story.  The first book was pretty realistic as far as the fantasy genre goes.      So, yes, this book is great as well, and it will make you want to pick up the next book in the series.

B0000DIXDR|5.0|Watching this movie brings back all those wonderfull years I spent in the Catskills with my family. I still get tearful when I see Jack Weston who is so lovable as the club owner. There were so many like him. They reminded me of this extended family all of us Italians had back in Brooklyn.....WHAT? HUGH? What am I saying.....I never went to Grossingers or the Concord or Browns or in this case Kellermans. But after watching this wonderful gem of a movie I now wish I had! These people really had something if it was anything like this movie. Imagine top entertainment, impecable grounds, families caring and sharing with themselves and others. What more could a family ask for? Here we have Jennifer Grey as this powerhouse of sexuality in a pint sized package wiggling and strutting her way through wipeout in those now famous cutoff dungaree shorts! And then there's Patrick Swayze in an electrifying performance reminiscient of John Travolta in a star making performance. The only down side is the improbable assortment of dirty dancers who are way too hip beyond the time period here. It seems out of place. Other than that a great supporting cast, a wonderful director, and a competant script make this one of the 50 best made films ever! You can't rent it.....you must own it....it's the ultimate feel good musical. I loved it!
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I'm not going to beat around the bush, this film is good, it's very good, With a exceptional performance from Mostly every actor in this movie, Coach Carter is a sunray admist the darkness of bad and immoral movies that have been released lately and i am very happy that people still want to make inspirational films. <br /> <br />The Plot-The movie starts with The Richmond High Basketball team losing a preseason game against one of their rivals and the team already looks like a mess before the season even starts.With teammates throwing the blame at other teammates, the team is not stable and is in need of authority. <br />The Present Coach has decided that he wants to retire and Has offered Ken Carter(Samuel L jackson) the job of being the coach for his team.After not much of thinking, Ken accepts the job with a fifteen hundred dollar check and takes responsiblity for the team. <br />As soon as Ken begins his coaching session with the kids he is tested very early as a kid named Cruz says he doesnt want to listen to the coach and Tells Ken that he is not scared of him and could knock him out if he wanted too.With Cruz face to face with Ken he makes like he is about to walk away and then tries to sucker punch Ken, But Ken with his quick reflexes catches his arm, twists it around and slams Cruz against the padded wall.This is a early sign to the kids that this coach is different and they will have to earn their playing time. <br /> <br />Coach Carter shows the kids parents that he has contracts for them and they must have atleast a 2.3 GPA, sit in front of all their classes, and must wear a suit and tie on gamedays. <br />To the parents displeasure they do not like this idea and already start to get bothered by Ken's strict policy and list of rules. <br />Coach Carter drills his players by running up and down the court repeately, many sets of pushups, grueling practices BUT what the kids and sadly not even the community realizes is Coach Carter cares for his players andwants them to succeed in basketball but more important he wants them to have good grades and go on to college after high school and avoid the street life. <br />But what happens when the players start to win, become a good basketball team but their grades are horrible and they don't adhere to the contract they signed with the coach? <br />Coach Carter does something very controversial that catches the attention of reporters,  parents, and  community members and you see how it plays out for the kids. <br /> <br />The Negatives-The only minor flaw that this movie has is it drags towards the ending.Just when you think it's over, it keeps going, you think it's over, Nope keeps going.It gets a little annoying but it doesn't damage the movie and the ending is worthwhile to watch anyway. <br /> <br />The Positives-Great performance by Samuel L jackson,Great supporting acting from the team members,Ashanti gets a little annoying with her baby momma drama but this movie does deliver a mostly great acted movie. <br />And to the guy that played Cruz, i have to give it to him he played a great role Dare i say a Best Supporting actor Oscar nomination? <br /> <br />Conclusion-This movie has it all, great acting, good sports action, humour, drama, suspense, And most important a great message.This movie should be seen by you and your whole family and every avid DVD sports fan MUST add this movie to their collection alongside Rudy, hoosiers, remember the titans and all the other sports classics. <br /> <br />4.5 stars rounded up to 5 out of 5  <br /> <br />The Opinionated One has spoken

0553573403|5.0|The writing in this book is incredibly evolved for the fantasy genre.  Not the stereotypical swords and dragons BS here.  Adult stuff, adult language.  The finest and most realistic women written by a man I have ever seen (which many writers, notably Jordan, do a deplorable job with). Real people with real problems, real political intrigue, real scumbags.  People die.  You have your Eddings, Goodkinds, and Jordans, who, while reasonably good writers, are deathly afraid they might offend somebody by randomly killing off characters, who seem to be constantly waving sharp pieces of metal around yet never get so much as a paper cut.  Scads of people perish in these books, with appropriate medieval brutality and realism.  This book sucks you right in, toys with your mind, surprises you with expertly gauged alacrity.  The only bad thing about it is the almost magnetic pull it seems to have on human hands, and the tendency of Martin to take his bloody time in releasing the sequels.  Despite my frustration, best fantasy I have ever read.
B000002KHH|5.0|\\"Paranoid\\" is not only Black Sabbath's most popular and breakthrough album, it is also arguably the best heavy metal album of all time. Saying that it's the best metal of all time should be enough to persuade you to buy it, but if you're still not convinced, read the rest of this review.<br /><br />Black Sabbath debuted in 1970, so they're probably one of the only bands you listen to that you're parents/teachers have heard of, can tolerate, and maybe even grew up listening to. Black Sabbath also saw the beginning of a guy named Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy would be fired from the band later in the 1970's, but he formed his own band, which was equally as successful. Plus, the work he did with BS earned him the title of \\"heavy metal's godfather.\\"<br /><br />Black Sabbath are, to me, the epitome of heavy metal, since (probably) at least 90% of modern metal bands were somehow influenced by them. Granted, Led Zeppelin were probably the band to give birth to heavy metal, but Sabbath are just as responsible for most bands (from Pantera to Slipknot to Eyehategod). And \\"Paranoid,\\" an album which featured five very famous songs, was pretty much as heavy as heavy music got in the 1970's, and was also the beginning of a type of metal known as \\"doom metal.\\" Doom metal is slow and melancholy and has dark and sludgy riffs. Bands like My Dying Bride and Crowbar wouldn't exist if it weren't for Ozzy and the gang. Tony isn't as good as Randy Rhodes, the guitarist in Ozzy's solo band, but he still is pretty great. Plus, he is even more of a legend when you consider Randy Rhodes probably wouldn't exist if it weren't for Tony.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid\\" is plenty old (now), so it's sound quality has definitely taken a dip. Other than that, however, it has aged very well. It is still getting radio play and bands are still being influenced by it. Even if Black Sabbath broke up, their legend lives on through other bands. Thus, if I've ever heard an album that has withstood the test of time, this is it.<br /><br />\\"War Pigs\\" follows the classic Black Sabbath song structure (soft-loud-soft-loud). It begins with a few guitar riffs and a drum beat, before turning to \\"dun dun\\" riffs, with a high hat crashing in between them. Ozzy then starts to sing about witchcraft and war, Bob does some good hand drum work and Tony plays slowly cascading riffs. A wailing guitar solo is included, and the tempo speeds up, but the song ends soon thereafter.<br />\\"Paranoid\\" might be the catchiest song the album. It's very fast paced with groovy guitars (which chug in the verses), has good vocal hooks and a short but sweet solo is tossed in at the end.<br />\\"Planet Caravan\\" is very spacey and mellow, due to the almost aquatic guitar chords, dreary vocals, and soft hand percussion (which almost sound like tribal drums). This song is partially famous because Pantera covered it, and even though they did a pretty good job, there's nothing like the original version.<br />\\"Iron Man\\" opens with a few thumping drums, then a world famous and very catchy guitar riff. The first four words are spoken with a robotic voice, and then the music changes to echo the vocals and lyrics. There's some more good, driving drumming here, but I think this guitar solo is the best on the album.<br />\\"Rat Salad\\" is an instrumental, and Bill's drum work makes it famous. It begins with almost machine gun snare drumming and fast pounding floor toms, and there's a great drum solo around the 1:15 mark. This everything but the kitchen sink solo lasts for about 50 seconds.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid\\" is nothing short of a classic. It is absolutely essential listening, and a cornerstone of any heavy metal collection. Buy this album or forever be un-metal Plus, since heavy metal is an important part of rock's history, \\"Paranoid\\" is a must own for any complete rock collection.. And even if metal isn't your thing, at least give Ozzy, Tony, Terence, and Bob credit for being the influential godfathers of metal, and for making one of the most important albums of all time.
0439679958|4.0|Anthony Horowitz has done it again!  He's managed to begin another series that will entice reluctant readers to pick up a book!!  Although, not as gripping as Stormbreaker (my favorites), Raven's Gate (the series) has the potential to develop into something exciting.  Edgy enough for reluctant boy readers, mysterious enough to keep anyone reading. <br />Anthony has done amazing things in my 7th grade classroom through his books!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Christopher Nolan's version of DC Comic's Batman takes itself very seriously -- it's far from Adam West's TV version in the 60s.  There is no \\"Robin\\" and no \\"Batgirl\\" for that matter.  It is about how Bruce Wayne becomes the Caped Crusader, and the film has enough actions to be called a summer season blockbuster (which it is) though the tone is slightly darker than any other previously filmed versions. <br /> <br />But David S. Goyer/Christoher Nolan gave a decent script for the film, in which we see Bruce as young boy of emormously rich family has to confront his ultimate fear when his parents got killed -- but if you don't like this rather serious 'looking into abyss' part, just forget it.  It is another story about one discontent youth looking for the meaning of life, which turns out being a superhero.  And you know that part before watching the film. <br /> <br />After wondering in Asia, being trained by a mentor Liam Neeson (again, like in \\"Episode I\\"), grown-up Bruce (played by Christian Bale with no British accent) comes back to Gotham City, the city of crimes and injustice. <br /> <br />[BATMAN IS THE HERO]  Of course he is, but in the previous films Batman (or Bruce Wayne) was a curiously umimpressive figure, for the villains like Joker or Riddler stole every scene.  In 'Batman Begins,' Nolan is very careful in making  Batman the center of the film.  It is his film, and Batman is always there, in the middle of good action scenes (including that of souped-up Batmobile). <br /> <br />Two interesting things.  One is that the film repeatedly refers to 'falling' (many actions involve vertical movement one way or another), a clever metaphor used by Nolan.  The other is the cast, among whom you see only two Americans -- Morgan Freeman and Katie Holms.  Londoner Nolan's choice is quite unique -- Jim Gordon is played by another Londoner Gary Oldman; Alfred is by Michael Caine (again, born in London), Falcone by Tom Wilkinson (English), Ducard by Neeson (Irish),  Dr.Crane (aka Screcrow) by Cillian Murphy (Irish), Earle by Rutger Hauer (Dutch), Ra's Al Ghul by Ken Watanabe (Japanese).  Even the homeless guy is Rade Serbedzija (Croatia).  Where is Amreican actors? <br /> <br />The film might be a bit too serious at times, but that is exactly what this new version is trying to do.  But the seriousness does not weigh down the whole film, which has effective actions that do not rely on CGI techniques.  In this sense, and with all name actors, 'Batman Begins' is like Christopher Reeve's 'Superman' -- it takes itself seriously, and very entertaining as well.
0920668372|5.0|My Mother read this to me when I was little, now that I have a daughter of my own I own this book and read it to her. It almost makes me cry everytime. It touched my heart sooo much that I had to own it for my child. My mother-in-law used to read this to the kids at the daycare she used to work at. She was almost in tears by the time she finished it when she first read it. This is the best book for a Mother (or Father) to read to their child(ren). This is a blessing to be able to share it with my child when it was shared with me as a child.
B000A6CLL0|2.0|Series star Jolene Blalock  -who identified herself as a lifelong Star Trek fan - has said that the failure of this series was because \\"The stories lacked intriguing content. They were boring.\\" She felt that the early scripts violated facts already established in other franchise shows and complained that the show substituted revealing costumes for character development. \\"The audience isn't stupid,\\"  she protested. For year three, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman decided that they would finally address some of the fan complaints that the series lacked any sort of continuity and launched a season long arc about Earth threatened by a mysterious race called the Xindi -who were, for all intents and purposes, organized much like DS9's Dominion. Through the next 26 episodes (which then would be cut to 24 due to faltering ratings), Archer and his crew would search the galaxy for the Xindi in hopes of preventing them from destroying Earth. While ambitious in a year before the return of serialized drama, the series quickly fell into the same pattern as the previous two seasons: poorly written stories that said nothing, acting that made most soap stars look like Oscar winners, and an almost F You! to fans of TOS, TNG and DS9.  The show was not grabbing people viscerally, as freakier aliens, lapses in logical story telling, and lack of character growth were taking over. No one, including me, felt a need to rush home and see this show, because it was saying nothing. There was a message there, I'm sure, but it was buried under technobabble and increasing desire to hurt women. I'm often remember Trek motion pictures 1,2,3,4 and 6 because the story had revelance to today. Enterprise missed that boat, even though the Xindi arc was a mushy allegory about 9/11. Archer's moral compass was thrown, but ultimatley, he never any long reaching effects. Some will say a good leader has no doubts, but Star Trek tried to show you through the years that long after an unpopular action, the capatin still might feel pangs of regret. But not Jonthan Archer. He was tough as nails guy. Pfft, I say, as he became a tool of a jingonistic Rick Berman. Still, one thing that came from this season was Manny Coto. He tried to return a sense of balance, but because UPN were more concerned with who was watching Trek instead of paying attention to who wasn't, this series was doomed. And while a letter campaign was started to save the show, in the end, it was not that would give this series one more season. UPN was going to cancel the show after season three, and then Paramount -home of the Godfather franchise -made UPN a deal they could not resist. Cutting the $1.5 million fee UPN paid Paramount to air the show to $875,000 made UPN reconsider airing the show. It would return for 22 more shows, but from that moment on, no matter how much Coto improved the show, Enterprise was doomed. The 10.5 millions fans had dwindled down to 2.5. And the logic that escaped the story telling for so many years, pointed out that if no one is watching, why air it?
0812550706|5.0|I first read the book in eighth grade because my cousin had recommended it.  I hate science fiction, but I read it anyways.  I've read hundreds of books, but this is the only book I've ever read more than once.  I read it five times, and now I'm actually reading it again(I'm in eleventh grade now).  It's very short, it's really simple, and there's nothing that really stands out, but for some reason it's by far my favorite book.

068987474X|5.0|This book guides women to saving time, avoiding heartache, and creating a space for the right man to come into their lives.  The overall emphasis is on the fact that women traditionally rationalize men's behavior and spend years of their lives with a man who doesn't really love them totally. It's like having a big brother who takes you step by step into the world of guys.  There is no blame, there is no guilt, it is \\"just the way it is.\\"  This book tells you not to waste your time with men who say the right words, but don't make the right moves.  It is the END of mixed messages.  Read this book, it will save you YEARS of time spent with the wrong man.  It truly is the best wake up call ever.

B0006399FS|1.0|Since 1991 U2 have been releasing sub par albums!!! <br /> <br />Although Zooropa & Pop were ok, they hardly had the magic of their previous releases. But the band went at an all time low with their first release of 2000, All that you can't leave behind despite having decent single releases was just very bland and void of ideas. <br /> <br />In truth How to dismantle an atomic bombs failings are hardly surprising, there is nothing new, and they seemed to have rehashed old ideas and just basically turning the volume up whilst hoping we don't notice how bad the tunes are. <br /> <br />There is nothing special about this bomb, and though it blasts at times (Vertigo, Because of You) this bomb turns out to have a malfunction and never seemed to have worked anyway!!!
B0001WTVUW|3.0|Maybe the effects are not as realistic as in T-2 (this was 1983)or more emotionally poweful as say \\"Threads\\" or \\"Testament\\" but there are several moments that stay with you forever. <br /> <br />The horrifying emotional cry of Bibi Besch realizing that nothing will ever be the same. Seeing the young girl with her father trying to go down to the basement of a building and when the bomb going off seeing everyone trample on her (notice her dress pattern), hearing the cries of Amy Madigan as she gives birth to her baby, with the sudden silence & then hearing the baby cry with all the close ups of survivors faces (maybe referencing a possible savior of the human race?). <br /> <br />But most of all, watching a civilized society crumble after the attack, whether through lawlessness or radiation sickness.  <br /> <br />Exceptional acting by all, especially Jason Robards, make this a very compelling film, rather than a curiosity item from the 1980's.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is such a fabulous movie!  Every scene is spectacular.   I saw this movie several times in the theater, and was very impressed with how well it was captured on the DVD.  It loses nothing in the translation.  It is well worth the money, and the second disc, showing how they made the movie is wonderful.  If you are a lover of musical theater, this movie is a must!!! If you loved the play, you will be blown away by the movie!
B00061QK02|4.0|Ok. Come on kids! This is a hysterical movie! Will Ferrell is one of the all time great comedians. If you don't find his work funny, then you just don't get it. Mr. Ferrell is the king of random comedy. He can go on and on about a subject and, if you didn't know who he was, you wouldn't know he was making it up as he goes. Not only did I love this movie, but I dig the soundtrack as well. You will not be disappointed if you are a Ferrell fan!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Excellent.  Every right wing conservative should see this film.. Obviously, Mel Gibson never did.
B000089RV6|4.0|This is one of the best remasters I have ever heard.  Every instrument is clear & loud & thunders from my speakers the way AC/DC should.  The booklet is full of great photos & the essay covers the story of this classic album well. The reason I have given 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lyrics (which were provided with the original CD issue) are not included. This should be mandatory with ALL reissues.  <br /> <br />The digipak packaging is better than some previous resissues & overall this fan is extremely satisfied. The music of course needs no review. This is the classic AC/DC album & has never been bettered.
1577311523|5.0|This book is one of the most practical, enlightening and insightful books I've ever read.  If you keep a log of your minds activities during the course of the day, will you discover that a good bit of that time is spent reflecting on the past, or anticipating the future.  Yet, as Eckhart Tolle points out, the now, this very instant in time, is all that is.  Life is the \\"now\\", the needle tracking along a grove in the record of life.  It's the looking back and ahead the generates a lot of negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, etc.  If we can concentrate all our energies into now, how much more fulfilling life would be.  Do you see your mind as a tool to be used to your advantage, or do you give it free reign to dart about the time continuum constructing an ego image that dictates who you think you are?  Can you control your mind?  This book will help you discover who you really are, put you in touch with that person, and from that point on, your life will never be the same.  It's a truely remarkable book.  Everything you read will ring true to you simply because it makes so much sense.  So much sense, you'll end up wondering why you never thought of it yourself.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|After three viewings in the theater,while sadly seeing it do poorly at the box office,as well as hearing both praise and harsh criticism, Nemesis doesn't seem at all like the same movie I saw Dec 13.   The biggest problem(despite a knuckle-headed decision to release it between Harry Potter and LOTR The Two Towers)was the story using ST II The Wrath of Khan as a template.The Next Gereration's final mission as they are led  into a trap by the new leader of Romulus who has a deep connection with Capt Jean Luc Picard.The sub plot of finding yet another Soong android didn't make things any better, as well as a cheat on the fate of Data.   The belief that Romulus would be controlled by not only their sub race,The Remans,but also make the Praetor,a human clone of Capt. Picard,as well as having an agenda to destroy the Federation(A repetitive,yet empty plot device).Nemesis has many great moments as well as the most exciting ship battle scenes ever seen in a ST movie.But as much as the TNG movies try,they are still big screen TV episodes.   Despite the many gapping plot holes as well as hearing fans rip this movie to shreds(It ranks above Search for Spock and Generations),Nemesis is still an entertaining movie(How could you top the collision scene!!!).
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Degrading and down right morbid horror movie that is more in tune with The Rocky Horror Picture Show than the comic book that it's based on. Keanu Reeves was just terrible as the lead character and he should be banned from ever acting again. Sadly, his performance was not the worse in the movie. That honor goes to the transvestite who plays the angel Gabriel, who looks like a reject from a John Walters movie. Her performance is beyond bad and along with the embarrassing performance of the guy who plays a gay devil make this one of the worse films to ever come out of a mainstream studio. The only and I do mean only good performance that comes out of this waste of film stock is from Rachel Weisz and her performance is so good in fact that in makes the movie uneven because you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen instead of the garbage that is right in front of you. You actually begin to feel sorry for her after a while and hope that she and her character was able to escape the movie all together.  <br /> <br />May become a cult classic but it deserves the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment more.  <br />
B0000CDLA7|5.0|There's been a lot of discussion regarding this album's direction and I don't know why.  I'll be direct: it's a great Dream Theater album that shifts the emphasis a bit toward guitar.  That's it.   <br /> <br />I've been listening to DT since about '92 and was able to listen in context of their previous work.  This and Scenes are the best albums they've done since Awake.  Every member shines.  This is Dream Theater for crying out loud!   <br /> <br />I don't see why everyone says that this album is overly heavy.  Go listen to Pull Me Under again and see what you think.  This album has long musical passages with great theme development, and the guitar and keyboard play off of each other like no mere metal band does.   <br /> <br />If you liked \\"Home\\" from Scenes From a Memory or \\"The Glass Prison\\" from 6 Degrees, you'll like this album.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Look to your left, is there a person near by? Chances are, they like Coldplays latest album, or have at least bought it anyway. No, you dont't need to read a review to help you decide whether to purchase this album, you just need to ask yourself \\"Do I sing along to advertisements on the TV and radio?\\" If the answer is yes, buy this album immediately, then find a herd of lemmings and follow them off a cliff.
0786856297|5.0|Riordan is known in San Antonio as a favorite as resident author.  He's taught at both high school and college level and writes mystery books  in the interim.  I'm glad he's decided to create a series for the younger crowd that his Mystery novels don't usually include.  This book shows that he truly knows his audience.  It brings Greek Mythology to kids in a way that is fun and exciting.  It creates interest that makes kids want to learn more about their favorite characters.  Percy's teachers are Gods and Centaurs and his friends are nymphs, satyrs, and demi-gods, sons and daughters of gods.  Percy's dad is ________, one of the great gods (yeah like I'm gonna ruin it).  Join Percy in his climb to the top of the Empire State building and his descent into the depths of hell (in an LA music studio, of course) it's a great ride, I recommend for everyone.

0385510454|4.0|The last several books I've read by John Grisham (Bleachers, for one) have not been to up to the caliber of his early books (The Firm, The Pelican Brief). The Broker, however, breaks this current trend and is actually a great book. Both my spouse and I read it within a week and had interesting discussions about the story. I did get a little tired of reading the Italian/English dialogue (you have to read it to understand), but overall thoroughly enjoyed The Broker!
B0006GAI6O|4.0|This is a great movie to watch if you're feeling a little low. It'll instantly snap you back into a wonderful mood. It's impossible not to laugh at the many wacky situations these characters get themselves into. Richard Gere is as charming as usual and Stanley Tucci steals the show with his over the top portrayal. A romantic riot all rolled into one.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbusters was one of my favorite movies as a kid, so last week I popped my old VHS into the VCR. Here's a movie that never gets old. It's behavioral comedy at its best: you can love it at any age, you'll never forget it once you've seen it, and even after all these years of familiarity, my head nearly burst I was laughing so hard. <br /> <br />I'm a fan of movies in which normal people interact in a realistic manner. Those are my favorite types of comedy. Sideways, Being John Malkovich, Annie Hall, Clerks, This Is Spinal Tap, and (my personal favorite) Pulp Fiction all fall under this heading. Ghostbusters is one of the best executed of this style. They joke knowing they're joking. There's a spontaneity about the characters as they express their fears and desires through humor.  <br /> <br />I don't care what fans of Lost in Translation say. This is Murray's best performance. It works because he's NOT sullen. He's just a regular guy we met one time at a university who went on to be a huge success. At one point, he sings his lines. It's not done in a showtune way. He just expresses that line by singing it. I've done that on rare occasions. Why, you ask? It's fun. The Ghostbusters may be brilliant scientists/bullsh*t artists, but really they just want to enjoy themselves. <br /> <br />The epic sci-fi comedy has been copied many time in recent years. Sometimes it works extremely well, as in the case of the Incredibles. Other times you get the wholly unremarkable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Reitman Keeps up the energy in a way Jennings could only dream of. <br /> <br />This is a film in which nothing feels scripted. New York is attacked by a marshmellow, but we believe it. After the film ends, the characters shrug off the damage, inspiring Winston: \\"I LOVE THIS TOWN!!!\\"
B00005JNTX|2.0|Once you get used to the style, which is great without question, you realize how boring this movie really is. That's except if you love guns, bar fights, hookers, swords, drugs, horror, dead people and every possible combination of these. I guess lot of folks do like to see this sort of stuff, hence the amazing 8.4 average rating on IMDB, amazing to me that is. <br />  Anyway, the one thing I liked about the movie is Mickey Rourke's acting, he just outcooled everybody. Benicio Del Toro was pretty good too. Token appearances by Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer and others. Can't say anything about Jessica Alba, she didn't really have a part in the movie until the end, and by that I just wanted it to be over.
B0002UOK04|3.0|Formerly of Enfiserum, guitarist and vocalist Jari Maenpaa has teamed up with Rotten Sound drummer Kai Hahto to form his new band Wintersun. Rounding out the lineup are Jukka Koskinen (Norther) on bass and Teemu Mantysaari (Imperanon) on second guitar. This is their first disc and expands on a variety of influences. Basically the music is mostly in a Euro power metal vein that utilises incessant double drum bass with highly melodic twin guitar lines.<br /><br />However, there is also some Gothenburg style death metal riffing mixed up with subtle folky passages that Maenpaa seems to have carried over from his former band. Granted this is no where near as Viking-inspired or folky as Enfiserum, there is a good dose of extreme metal injected into their songs, mostly reminiscent of Children of Bodom and Norther. Maenpaa's extreme scream vocals bring to mind Alexi Laiho's vocals on the earlier Children of Bodom discs, but Maenpaa also uses some clean vocals employing a low, deep register. Best exemplified on their metallic anthem \\"Winter Madness\\", he lays down a clean vocal performance over a folky melody during the breakdown that wouldn't seem out of place on a Blind Guardian or Skyclad album. The way the drums and melodic twin guitar attacks blend with a symphonic keyboard backdrop give way to a neoclassical guitar solo with brutal scream vocals on top of it all. \\"Sleeping Stars\\" is another melodic metal number starting with deep clean vocals quickly shifting to the black-ish scream type of singing. The production on this album is mediocre, and it seems the song arrangements needed more work in the studio. This certainly lacks the pristine and smooth sounds of Children of Bodom and Norther, two bands whose fanbase Wintersun must have targeted to some extent.<br /><br />\\"Battle Against Time\\" is one of the longer cuts, spanning 7 minutes. It has a long, drawn-out intro that is centred around fast guitar riffing and some background vocals humming a nice melody. As the keys make their way into the track along with the vocals, it becomes more interesting with nice shifts of melody and tone. The operatic clean vocals over staccato guitar riffs and pounding kick-drums is quite enjoyable and renders this one of the most diverse tunes on this disc. Blazing guitar solos, pulverizing keyboards and an impressive rhythm workout only serve to enhance the powerful chorus sung in a nice counterpoint style. No such album goes without power ballads. Check out \\"Death and the Healing\\" with tons of acoustic guitars, catchy melodies and a subdued folk sadness. The chorus of this song isn't their best, but works well nevertheless.<br /><br />Wintersun's eponymous album is an average album. It sure lends itself to a multitude of genres from power metal to melodic metal to folk, but honestly, this is just a less successful version of Children of Bodom. Future releases will sure find them improving, but so far my opinion is that Wintersun needs to decide what they really want to focus on and take things from there. Otherwise, for the regular Enfiserum fan they won't be Viking-metal enough, whilst the average Norther listener won't find the guitar-keyboard duels as satisfying. On the melodic front however, this album will appeal to many fans.keys make their way into the track along with the vocals, it becomes more interesting with nice shifts of melody and tone.

B00000AFWW|4.0|\\"Celebrity Skin\\" released just four years after the critically acclaimed \\"Live Through This\\" is a totally new experience for Hole fans, one that is much more mainstream and different from their grungy, hard rocking past.  The songs themselves are shiny and slicked back like an Italian man's hair.  It seems that Courtney Love forced her vocals into a strainer to remove the impurities she once may have had.  However, these \\"impurities\\" made Hole a lot more genuine, and this shiny version of Hole isn't the greatest (the reason I am only giving \\"Skin\\" four stars). <br /> <br />Yet, there is no denying that this album can still rock.  The album starts with the title track \\"Celebrity Skin\\" which puts the listener  right in the heart of Hollywood, where plastic surgery junkies strut around fresh from a Botox session.  Some other pop treats include \\"Awful\\", \\"Malibu\\" and \\"Boys on the Radio\\".  The more impressive tracks that contain the extended depth that made Hole famous are \\"Northern Star\\", \\"Reasons to Be Beautiful\\" and \\"Petals\\".  The rest of the songs are good, and continue with the pop-rock vibe. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is a good album.  It succeeds in providing a genuinely pop-rock experience that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people, and of course Hole fans.
B0006L16N8|3.0|When I picked up the albums \\"Parachuttes\\" and \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" by Coldplay, I was fasicinated by how challenging the albums initially were, and then after a few listens how intriguing and listenable they ended up becoming. Chris Martin's distictive British accent soars over melancholy lyrics and a rather downbeat rhythmn, making for a unique and addicting listen. It makes one think, and hurts the mind after a while because of how much of an emotional ride it can take you on. So I picked up \\"X & Y\\" with the same interests and desires, and while it isn't a terrible album, it isn't as great as it could have been. <br /> <br />While past Coldplay albums could be comparable to Radiohead albums in their complexity, downbeat rhythmns, and dark, melancholy lyrics, \\"X & Y\\" is more comparable to U2, and that's not a bad thing, but it could disappoint some fans who enjoyed the more challenging material of the past two albums. The material on this album is more upbeat, pop/rock, and has much easier access to a mainstream audience. Though it does have it's moments of greatness, there are a couple of things that just make me knock off two stars. One, too many of the songs sound alike. Two, the lead off single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", sounds much like a \\"Clocks\\" rehash, though I do like the song, it would have been nice to see them make a little more of a diverse attempt for their first single, not just play it safe. <br /> <br />Again, I'm not saying this is a terrible album. I could care less that it is a popular album and people are picking it up like hot cakes, I'm not one of those types who automatically hates a band or artist because they are popular, they should go for a large audience, because music is their business. However, I know that Coldplay can bend the envelope more than they did this time, and that leaves me a little disappointed. However, there are some good songs hear to listen to, so \\"X & Y\\" could be the transition of Coldplay to a mainstream audience akaU2, or it could have just been a new attempt at something until they go back to their roots.

B00005Y228|3.0|I was saddened to hear of her illness, but she'll be okay. If only I could perform a surgical extraction on some of the tracks on this cd it would get a grand 5-stars. I love the artwork - so sexy. It reminds me of album artwork of late 70's disco albums. Mmmmm, yessss. There are brilliant tracks here. Working with the genius Cathy Dennis (in spite of the American Idol theme) is the best thing Kylie's done. Cathy, why aren't you working MORE, baby? The first 3 tracks make my system BUMP like you wouldn't believe, as well as \\"Come Into My World\\", which has an amazing vidclip by Gondry. Kylie, get well soon - and give Cathy a call when you're ready to move it again...

There are NO full blooded people here that are Americans including Indians and if we all just knew OUR OWN HISTORY we could help our nation. Obama's story is wonderful and all thinking people should read it and I am sure you will find yourself in it and all your family, because we can  tell almost the same story.
B00097A5HW|4.0|I'm a new Shakira fan.  I didn't know about her until her last album, her English debut Laundry Service.  I enjoyed the singles off that album, but I never picked it up.  I'm not a huge \\"pop\\" fan and didn't think I would enjoy the rest of the cd too much.  When Fijacion Oral vol 1 came out, I heard the single Tortura and its remix and was immediately onboard.  The rest of the cd is almost as good, and some even better, than Tortura. <br /> <br />The cd is very interesting mix of genres.  I was expecting more sultry, quicker paced songs like Tortura and was, at first disappointed.  But my disappointment slowly grew into appreciation for the different types of music Shakira is trying out.  Some of the songs almost sound like classic soft rock.  Particularly, song 4 Obtener un Si has the tonal quality, the horns and the beat of some classic soft rock songs.  And, some songs sound like some folk rock American artists I listen to.  Aimee Mann came immediately to mind on some songs.  Not voice-wise, but the way the songs sounded and the accompaniment.   <br /> <br />Ever since I first heard Shakira I have been in love with her voice and this cd just helped my infatuation.  I would recommend it.  If you're looking for a strictly \\"today pop\\" cd, you won't exactly find it here.  Instead, you'll find an artist who is willing to pull different genres, styles of music and melodies together.  It's a pretty decent cd; one that makes me want to pick up her earlier stuff and get to know her as an artist.  Definitely recommend.
0711986746|4.0|This is a pretty good book in my opinion. Although it does contain unusual grammar that bothered me some. This book explains a lot about Freddie's behavior off stage, outrageous nights, ect... I must warn those of you who want to learn about his childhood, the start of Queen, previous bands, ect... This book does not contain this content what so ever. If you want to know about this stuff, I advise that you buy the DVD called  <br />\\"Freddie Mercury, The untold story, by those who knew him best\\" That DVD tells everything starting with birth and ending with death. Only problem is that its hard to find. Anywho, back to this book, it just gives details on tours the band had, FM's lifestyle, his overall characteristics, lovers and what Peter Freestone did as an employee for Queen/Freddie Mercury. It is quite interesting, but also boring in some parts. It necissarily isn't a must have if you want to know all about the beginning of his life to the beginning of queen. I guess it was just fun to read if you want to pass time away.
B000065VA1|4.0|This is one of Peter Gabriel's Best CD's. It has the songs from 1986 that everyone in the US would remember being played all over the airwaves. This is one of my all time favorite albums.
B00005JNSK|5.0|As a mid-twenty something guy who grew up with the original 1971 movie, I was hoping that this remake wasn't going to tarnish the original's memory.  It didn't.  This version stuck to the book in just about everyway form and gave a darker feel to what Rohald Dahl may have originally intended.  It surpassed my expectations, but didn't surpass the original film's flawlessness.  Below are some of my personal thoughts and comparisons: <br /> <br />Charlie- This Charlie was better that 1971's.   <br />Wonka's dad- I love Christopher Lee, but thought the movie could have done without this. (I can't remember if this was in the book either.)   <br />Squirrels VS Geese- Yes there were no geese, but Veruca Salt's(the actress not the band) song, \\"Gooses, Geeses\\" should have been worked in there somehow.   <br />Songs- These songs are a \\"no go.\\"  The first movies' songs were so much better.  I'm happy there weren't as many in this one though.   <br />Moral ideas- This movie didn't stress the moral issues that the righteous child won the prize at the end.  Ehh who cares? <br />Oompa Loompas- I don't like the fact that they were all played by the same person.  However that person was Deep Roy and he is awesome in everything he does, so hats off to Tim Burton.   <br />\\"Cheer up Charlie\\"- THANK YOU GOD, for not putting that song in the remake.  I wore out the fast forward button on my remote from this song. <br />70's Lingo- I know it's 2005, but \\"jumping crocodiles\\" still has a place in this man's heart.   <br />The wall of Schnazberries- Where my I ask is it?  <br />Charlie's dad- Actually I enjoyed his presence.  I didn't think I would, but it all worked out for the best.   <br />Beginning- There was not as much emphasis on the background of Willy Wonka's factory and the golden ticket search, but t did leave more time for the factory, so again, not a problem.   <br /> <br />All in all I did like the original better, but I think that kids today will enjoy the remake better.  IF anybody who has not seen this is reading this while it is still in the theaters.  Please go see it.  This is one of the few movies that come out that needs to be seen in the theater to get the full experience.  <br />
B00000AFGM|5.0|I don't know what the Moral Majority and all those other conservative organizations are talking about.  Calling Manson's music Satanic or Evil.  This stuff is hardly demonic...It's just good rock n' roll with a slight edge to it.  Nothing shocking here, just 14 tracks of listening pleasure.  Much different then Anti-Christ or any of his other previous works.  Don't judge Manson by what you hear about him on the 700 Club, give this a listen...it couldn't hurt!
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles always produce great music, but this one has expressed them as they started to depart from each other forming their own way of music. The songs express themselves very well. This is needed in any Beatles collection.
0790731452|5.0|I have three all time favorite directors and Tim Burton is the first. I LOVED all the movies he has made and I have seen. From one of his oldest, Nightmare Before Christmas, and his newest, Charlie and the Chocolate Factoery, they are all five stars for me! I saw this movie once on television but couldn't really remember it much. Then I saw it in Target for five dollars and I learned it was directed by Tim Burton! I immediatley bought it and watched it. It was great! Funny and action-y, it was perfect especially with Danny Elfman's music!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The songs are alot cleaner and are a pleasure to listen to without the crackling noises of the original. \\"Fly On The Wall\\" really shows an inside look at what happened during the time when they were creating \\"Let It Be\\". The songs are the same except they leave out \\"Maggie Mae\\", but that's not important as long as we have \\"Let It Be\\", \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", and \\"Get Back\\". All the songs are classics. This is a needed factor in a pur Beatles collection.

B00005JLR2|1.0|Of Trash. Michael Eisner is a money crazy freak. Disney is not how it used to be, and this movie shows it. The classic musicals are no more. This movie is a take on of Treasure Island, so why couldn't they just make it treasure island? They have to make everything so \\"Teen\\", because it is not about the kids anymore, or even the teens, just the money.  <br /> <br />PS: Walt Disney would roll around in his grave if he see's his name on trash like this movie, and the disney channel stuff, and the expensive tickets to get into the park he made for ALL kids to enjoy.
B000002L9J|5.0|At the fall of 1985 The Smiths were in crisis!!!    Although their last album Meat is Murder hit number 1 in the UK it would actually proove to be less of a comercial success than its predecessor, indeed it couldn't even produce a top forty hit single in the UK (That Joke isn't funny anymore only reached 47!!)    The press hit the anti Smiths button big time, although their was no doubting their musical quality the press just thought with everyone now at their back Morrissey and co. would crumble and just simply break up and fade away!!!    Early in 1986 The Smiths hit the studio and recorded The Queen is Dead, and finish the albums recording within months. By April the song The Boy with the Thorn in his side would be released as the first single but it peaked at a dissapointing 22!!!    Worse was to follow when the follow up single Bigmouth Strikes Again would be banned on all major UK radio stations for its violent lyrical content which was deemed too hot back in 1986, and therefore the song stalled at 25!!!    But the albums release would actually proove to be a turning point!!!    It would actually be praised by the critics as a masterpiece, and although originally peaking at number 2 in the album charts, years later after The Smiths had broken up the album by 1992 was considered a masterpiece, and for good reasons!!!!    From the clever dear old blightly intro in The Queen is Dead, which then rocks of to one hell of a Jonny Marr riff, the song also highlights Morrisey's unique insight into life, and his amazing wit, for example when Morrisey imagines meeting The Queen he comments \\"So I broke into the palace, with a sponge and a rusty spanner, she said I know you and you cannot sing, I said that's nothing you should hear me play piano!!!\\"    Frankly Mr Shankly is a song dedicated to their former manager, who supposedly cheated the band out of alot of money. Morrisey refers to himself as Shankly \\"I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr Shankly\\" and the song is actually written from the managers viewpoint \\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask, you are a flatulent pain in the arse, I do not mean to be so rude, still, I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly, Oh give us your money !\\"    I know it's over is an excellent song and one of the strongest on the album and has perhaps one of Morrisey's defining lyrical moments \\"If you're so funny why are you on your own tonight.\\" Whilst Never had no one ever follows on a similar road!!!    Cemetry Gates changes the pace, it is perhaps the most clever Smiths song ever, it's basically Morrisey pretending that he is arguing about someone about who has the best books \\"Keats and Yates are on your side, but you loose, cos I've got Wylde on mine.\\"    Bigmouth Strikes Again, and The boy with The Thorn in his side are the singles released on the album which I mentioned earlier, whilst Vicar in a Tutu, is well...basically about what the song title says, then comes There is a light that never goes out!!!!    If there was a Smiths song that best describes The Smiths, then this is it. It has humour, depression, but yet hope, and all this is conveyed in perhaps the greatest chours I can ever remember \\"And if a double decker bus crashes into us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die!!!\\" The song eventually be realsed as a single in 1992 peaking at 16, but was more recently not only voted by Smiths fans as the best Smiths song, but also by VH1 viewers as the greatest Indie song ever!!!!    The album ends with Some Girls are Bigger Than Others, Morrissey points out the obvious, as the title conveys, well as Antony may have said to Cleopatra as he opened a crate of ale (If they were listening to this album) Err...this is a great album, hey Cleo!!!!    And he'd be right to say so!!!    The Queen is Dead is the essential Smiths album to buy, not only because it is their masterpiece, and therefore their greatest album, it also belongs in the greatest 10-20 albums of all time, and is easily the best album of the 1980's!!!     So to conclude, if there's only one Smiths album you are going to buy, let it be this one because it may be the nearest thing to perfection that one may ever hope to achieve!!!!
B00092ZMDY|4.0|They are all older and it shows but not as badly as on some rockers from the same era. The interviews were a terrific part of the dvd as you heard them, wiser, more committed to the music and to the experience of sharing the music with those who love to listen and to sing along with them. If you don't like the Eagles, you probably didn't buy this. I grew into whatever passes for my maturity with them as part of the background music. I like them still and I think they are better musicians now and certainly wiser about what the excesses of \\"the Life\\" can do to one's self.
B000002LBH|5.0|Released late in 1986, Louder than bombs was the US version of the UK album The World Won't Listen. It included all the songs from that album, including most of the songs from Hatful of Hollow (which wasn't released in the US until 1996) and three bonus songs, Is it really so strange, Sheila take a bow (a top 10 hit in the UK), and Sweet & Tender Hooligan!!!    The album would include non-ep singles such as Panic (which peaked at 11 in the UK) Shakespeares siter (#14) the forementioned Sheila take a Bow (10) Ask (#14), and singles from Hatful of Hollow, William it was really nothing (#17), and Heaven knows I'm miserable now (10)!!!    The album also has brilliant moments too, it includes perhaps one of The Smiths most wonderful songs Half a Person, and also includes the delicious Asleep, as well as other gems such as London, You just haven't heard it yet baby, Rubber Ring, and Stretch out & wait!!!!    Although it does include perhaps The Smiths worst song Diamond Lights!!!!    But what's amazing is that this is a B-side collection, again prooving that Smiths b-sides were better than most bands classics!!!    The album would actually proove more sucessful chart wise in the UK, than the US (despite being an import album release) where it would peak at 30, and though in the US it would peak at 63, this would proove to be The Smiths most sucessful chart placing to date beating the previous release The Queen is Dead's 70 chart peak!!!

B000002H97|4.0|Just kidding, Metallica released the Black Album in 1991 to incredible commerical success and mainstream acceptance. Metallica with an aptly self titled album reinvented itself. The song structures are much more streamed down, catchy, and less sprawling and progressive. Unfortunately, this change was not for the better. If Metallica were an electric light burning bright through the glam excess of the 80s, they had reverted to being an wooden torch(sorry for the metaphor but I thought it was kinda cool). Later they faded into the darkness with a string of mediocre to horrid albums (Load, Reload, St. Anger).  <br /> <br />Yet the Black Album isn't all that bad. It's definitely hard hitting. The riffs are still heavy and muscular(though less in creativity and plentiful). The songs are all decent. But they just don't grab my attention as much as previous masterpieces like One. The big hit Enter Sandman is a highlight and simply crushes if you listen to it on a good stereo. But it still pales in comparison to Metallica's past accomplishments. On a side note, the sandman(take my hand...off to never never land) reminds me of Bob Rock's unintentional dragging of Metallica into the spotlight and into eventual into mediocrity. Just a thought. Other tracks like Sad But True, Unforgiven, and Wherever I May Roam are also strong and happen to be big hits. However, some of these songs are just somewhat above normal or painfully average(just about everything else). Compare Fade To Black to Nothing Else Matters and you'll see how the Metallica of the Black Album doesn't quite measure up to the Metallica of old.  <br /> <br />Although this review may make me seem like a jaded  metal crumudgeon who hates change, I really don't hate the fact that Metallica changed. It's the fact that Metallica became less interesting that I'm not happy about. But despite the complaints of a multitude of metal fans, this album is somewhat good. However, you'd be well advised to check out Metallica's previous works. If you thought this was great, you may be blown away by Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning, true metal masterpieces.
B00002E23E|4.0|The Song Remains The Same (1976), the Led Zeppelin movie<br /><br />[This review also refers to the CD 'The Song Remains The Same' soundtrack and so this review appears on that product also]<br /><br />There is little that hasn't already been said about Led Zeppelin. Simply one of the greatest bands of all time, their studio albums are one amazing collection, however, the one thing that lacks with the band's catalogue is recorded live material. Led Zeppelin, for all their popularity and fame, were a pretty camera shy band who avoided giving interviews and releasing live footage of them playing. However, for many years, the one exception to this was 'The Song Remains The Same' movie, released in 1976, which combined the band playing live at Madison Square Garden in 1973 with various other scenes in between.<br /><br />Since this film's release nearly 30 years ago, there have been recent releases of the band live which supercede this DVD. These include the awesome 'Led Zeppelin' double DVD and the 'How The West Was Won' soundtrack both released in 2003. However, in perspective, 'The Song Remains The Same' still remains an awesome live document and should not be ruled out. Some reviewers seem to have bashed this release with comments such as relating to the fact the concert footage is intermingled with scenes of the band at home and fantasy settings. I take these people's points however at the end of the day this DVD is a MOVIE not solely a LIVE MUSIC DVD. Also, when the scenes do eject away from the concert footage, the live music at the concert continues playing and so you still hear Led Zeppelin live even if the scene is concentrating on something else. Furthermore, the other scenes aren't all that bad. Some of them are just fantasy settings, whilst others are scenes of the band members at home and in other parts we even get interviews (including a 5 minute rant from manager Peter Grant at the concert; filmed backstage where he is rightfully complaining about fake posters being sold of the band).<br /><br />For the music on 'The Song Remains The Same' release, you really have two options. The first is to get the DVD, which gives you the full film, and therefore the music played, the live footage and the extra scenes. Alternatively, if you just want to hear what features on the film, buy the soundtrack CD which features the 9 live tracks which are played, plus the Bron-Yr-Aur intro and the 'Stairway To Heaven' studio version which plays at the end of the film.<br /><br />The actual Madison Square Garden concert from 1973 was one of Led Zeppelin's highlights in terms of their live career. All in all, 9 songs which they played there are captured in the film. The highlights have to be firstly, the almost half-hour long version of 'Dazed and Confused', where the band keep the song in suspense in miraculous style. 'No Quarter'. which features some whizz keyboard work from John Paul Jones and some great guitar solos played by Jimmy Page (during ths song, another fantasy scene ensues in the movie). John Bonham's drumming is furious and creative during the performance of 'Moby Dick' and the band's closing showcase of 'Whole Lotta Love' is a memorable finisher. All in all, the music itself is great.<br /><br />Eventhough I would never say this film DVD holds a candle to the recent Led Zeppelin DVD release and the 'How The West Was Won' live set, it is still an excellent film with some timeless captures of the band performing live at the time when they were at their peak. The concert is brilliant, the few interviews are good and the fantasy styled editions, yes are a little cheesy but aren't too bad non the less!

B0009QTS1M|5.0|An excellent solid addition to ones sand and sandals collection of films. I thought that while the premise was a little far fetched the writing, acting and photography over came this problem! I think Ben Hur would of liked this film.
B000003CMD|5.0|This is an old road to travel on, to be sure, but it doesn't hurt to sing praise one more time, in case there are newcomers or young folk happening by . . .  <br />Duane Allman stands as a mighty god in the annals of rock and ranks in the pantheon of the legendary dead young, but people be clear about this, Dickey Betts stands on the mountain, too, and no throwing him out for good for being a pain in the freakin' butt is going to change that. His business here, with Chuck Leavell, to these ears, marks the peak of the Allman Brothers story. Yes to the 'Fillmore' and yes to 'Eat a Peach,' but this one here dispenses with the experimentation and mostly hit, sometimes miss jam passages and opens the revival tent to all. It is an American masterpiece. Mr. Betts delivers joyously one of the most distinctive tones in the history of electric guitar, spinning waves and patterns of lovely melody around the chuggin' Allmans like ribbons of gold. So, too, Mr. Leavell, as beautiful and soulful a piano player as you'd ever want to hear. We don't leave out Greg Allman because there is a, mournful workingman's dead earnestness about his music here, a true woeful blues and lord knows these were troubled times for the family. Nevertheless, look outside the context and just at the album itself. It has lost its cache somewhat over the years, but anyone who has ever professed to love or even know American music, in all its diversity and glory, needs to know \\"Brothers and Sisters.\\" That good. I haven't checked, but I hope Amazon agreed with its little blue 'e.' . . . Essential.
B000000W5B|3.0|Goats Head Soup is a very uneven recording, but it's worth adding to your collection. GHS features the Stones' classic, \\"Angie\\" but there are some lesser known tracks on this recording that are better than I'd remembered: \\"Star Star\\" is a great tune. The lyrics of this tune (the actual title of which is \\"Starf##ker\\") are so off-color that they were distorted and obscured when it was originally released in 1973. On the remastered CD, you can hear Mick deliver what amounts to an amusing and fairly pornographic time capsule circa 1973 (complete with references to John Wayne, Steve McQueen, and Ali McGraw). \\"Hide Your Love\\" is also an outstanding track and it features a couple of really outstanding guitar solos.
B0007QJ1N4|1.0|After just playing the album through for the first time before writing this review, I realize I haven't given what I just heard much time to sink in, but since first impressions are everything, I'm gonna share mine.  This album is boring, it has no emotion, it all sounds the same, and the title was right on the money...\\"lullabies to paralyze\\", because that's all this album will do to/for you...put you to sleep.  I don't quite get why a a lot of the american public has a boner for this band, because if this album has anything to say about it, there's some poor tastes in music out there.  Have I heard crappier music than this?  of course.  could I make a better album myself?  of course not.  but for the hype that surrounds this band, this is unacceptable.
B0001AP12G|5.0|After years as a celebrated producer behind the boards at Roc-A-Fella Records, Chicago native Kanye West finally delivered his own solo debut, \\"The College Dropout,\\" in 2004. \\"The College Dropout\\" really is a wonder of a project to behold, an overblown and at times ridiculous showcase of a man and his life. While the production is the kind of excellent music you'd expect, I think Kanye really made this album special because of his work on the microphone. He's not the kind of street rapper and vocabularist like most of his labelmates, rather, I think he found so much mainstream appeal because he comes across as very human. His verses sound very conversational, a lot of people can relate to his everyday subject matter, and he makes himself look like an underdog in a world full of gangsta rappers. What also makes him endearing is that although he really is a great rapper, he does his best not to flaunt it. Sometimes, he'll rhyme a word with the same word in the next line, or end a verse by flowing off the beat just to show he's human. The journey he speaks of from college dropout to depressed wage worker to lucky hip hop producer is fairly inspiring and part of what makes him so likable. Before the media started portraying him as someone with an oversized character, \\"The College Dropout\\" made many believe otherwise. The songs throughout the album are emotional, thought-provoking, and fun. The production ended up having a wide influence throughout hip hop. Kanye's sample-heavy beats are nostalgic for an earlier era, using squeaky, sped-up vocal samples. His sound is very unique and is almost as friendly as his microphone presence. There are a few very minor missteps over the course of the debut, but \\"The College Dropout\\" is a winner, an unlikely champion and a widely influential album.<br /><br />After the intro, the album begins with the anthemic \\"We Don't Care,\\" an anthem for kids from the wrong side of the tracks about overcoming struggles. The song is funny and very catchy. On the single \\"All Falls Down,\\" Kanye recounts the ways of an image-troubled woman, and his lyrics here might be the best on the album, full of irony and funny one-liners. The beat is also quite clever. Another one of my favorites is \\"Spaceship,\\" a song where a depressed Kanye provides insight into the life of a poor man with few options, another excellent production with an anthemic quality. The hit \\"Jesus Walks\\" was a landmark for hip hop. Despite being a lyrically and musically piece of creative genius, this song really brought Christian influence to urban radio, and Kanye should be respected for that. Jay-Z and J. Ivy guest on the inspired \\"Never Let You Down,\\" a highlight, and Talib Kweli and Common are featured on the light, loopy club track \\"Get 'Em High.\\" \\"The New Workout Plan\\" is meant to be a humorous song, it's a low point on the disc though, it doesn't fit in too well and doesn't come off very well. The classic \\"Slow Jamz\\" follows, the hit collaboration with Jamie Foxx and Twista. The version on \\"The College Dropout\\" is a slightly remixed version from the one you might be familiar with, but it maintains its creative genius and hilarious hook and gorgeous music. \\"Breathe In Breathe Out\\" is another club song along the lines of \\"Get 'Em High,\\" this one featuring Ludacris. It's not my favorite, but a perfectly fine addition to the tracklist. \\"School Spirit\\" is a very ironic look at American culture. Kanye maintains that the structure of high schools and poor people's feelings that they must pay for college is unnecessary, it's a very interesting take to hear. Mos Def and Freeway guest on the rough \\"Two Words,\\" followed by Kanye's classic first single, \\"Through the Wire.\\" I absolutely love this song, a dramatic and epic count of his near-fatal car accident, over a perfect beat anchored with a Chaka Khan sample. This song was infamously recorded with his jaw wired shut, and it was a perfect single. The album closes with the sad \\"Family Business\\" and the 13-minute \\"Last Call,\\" an interesting track where he recalls his entire musical career.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The College Dropout\\" is an inspired, entertaining, and fulfilling debut from a truly multitalented artist. It's received a fair amount of hate for all the success it had, but I think this was undeserved. From a lyrical and musical perspective, this album is excellent from all sides, and I highly recommend it to all hip hop fans.nute \\"Last Call,\\" an interesting track where he recalls his entire musical career.

B000000W6R|5.0|I think this is a great CD. Being a B-sides and rarities collection CD, you'd probably expect the songs to be not so good. However, this is one of my favorite CDs from the Pumpkins. It has awesome hard rock songs like Pissant, Hello Kitty Kat, and Girl Named Sandoz (I think they do an awesome cover of the original version by the Animals). Also, their are peaceful, slower songs like Soothe and La Dolly Vita. Overall, it's an awesome CD and I highly recommend it.
1593072937|4.0|Okay, okay it's not Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard - it's not even over the top anime'. It is a great escapist read. This is truly the kind of comic book your mother would not ever buy for you! <br /> <br />Poor Marv, the lithium deficient protagonist, has a bad case of anger mis-management. On his good days - few and far between - he is merely paranoid. But, just because he's paranoid does not mean that the really dark forces of evil are not after him - they are. Sin City, The Hard Goodbye, is drawn in a jarring black and white of words and graphics - grays need not apply. <br /> <br />So, why read this comic book? If you are an eclectic reader - and I am - I'll bet you haven't picked up a comic book in what? - 10, 20 years. You'll be surprised how this book jars your brain on first read. It really knocks out the dust. It is also a great brain shaker if you are stuck on an overnight plane flight and cannot sleep. Actually, this isn't a cure for insomnia as much as it is a way to blast the insomnia out of your brain. <br /> <br />Read Sin City. Your brain needs the exercise!

B00068NVI4|5.0|I Preordered this DVD over a year ago. I received it on August the 3rd. -that's six days before official release-. I can only tell you: WHAT A TREAT!!!!. Music is food for the soul and Yes certainly is not for Fast Music eaters. Turned out to be Gourmet Music, and obviously, the delays in the release -not being The Band's fault-, are irrelevant compared to the final product. The rendition of the \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" almost brought tears to my eyes, for made me feel like 30 years ago when I was trying to digest the whole idea of Yes music in concert with their thightness, proffesionalism and freshness as if it was just Yesterday. I'm 47, and while watching and listening tho this show in DTS surround, I'm feeling 17 again. In whole this is one of the best YES performances with their all around classic line-up. Combined with the \\"Keys To Ascention\\" DVD you get the original epic YES concept. My only complain: why do they keep leaving out \\"Close To The Edge\\" from this shows on DVD?  Technically, picture and sound are of digital quality, and there are not many extras other than the interview with James Dean which, by the way, is also a treat since there is interaction with band members and it shows some of the staging process. Now, there are plenty of bonuses in all other Yes DVDs.  I'm I biassed? OF COURSE, I happen to have an excellent taste for music, I don't go for the cheap and simple stuff. And Yes for more than 30 years has delivered with perfection and accuracy to satisfy me.  By the way,  This reviews should focus on content not marketing flaws. Please, don't hurt the musicians. If you don't like them, don't buy them!!!!
B00006LI26|3.0|Originally released as a 9 song LP, this version of Walls of Jericho includes the 5 song mini EP and the Judas single.  All in all a pretty good bang for the buck.  This is probably the fastest album Helloween ever did, and Walls rivaled anything from the day--including releases from Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, Venom, and (dare I say) Slayer.  Walls of Jericho is definitely balls out metal.  Lots of double bass and twin guitar work.  The bad thing is, all of the songs (except Gorgar) sound the same.  There really is no variety in tempo between each song.  In addition, I don't particularly care for Kai Hansen's vocals on this album, as he was Helloween's original singer.  Nonetheless, Starlight, Victim of Fate, and Heavy Metal (Is The Law) are cool songs.  Also, $10 for the mini EP, the album, and the Judas single all wrapped together is a good deal.  Check it out--this is the birth of Helloween.
B000001E18|3.0|As the Beatles were, U2 is a band that has, and continues to constantly change faces, which is by no means meant in a negative sense. Part of what makes them one of the greatest rock n' roll acts in history is their all-encompassing body of work. There is a U2 song, and often times an album, for any mood. With that said, it's inevitable that some of their experiments will go wrong.  <br /> <br />While other U2 albums keeps some consistent underlying themes, such as the anthemic guitar playing and effects of The Edge, for the most part \\"Zooropa\\" fails to keep these intact. To put it simply \\"Zooropa\\" has so much less life than the U2 classics of old. It branches off into a more electronic sound, leaving behind the guitar- driven power exemplified on \\"The Joshua Tree.\\" It tries to be discreet in its songwriting, such as in the track \\"Numb,\\" while leaving behind their directness and life in writing that is so well exemplified on \\"Achtung Baby.\\"  <br /> <br />With all that said, \\"Zooropa\\" turned out to be an interesting experiment. The result is that U2 and electronic rambling don't mix. The only true gem on the album, \\"Stay,\\" teaches us a different lesson, however. It's completely stripped of guitar effects, uses little production, and has a redundant lick repeated endlessly in the song. And yet, its simplicity is really its draw. There's no sound to hide behind, which gives the song a truly honest feeling.  <br /> <br />Sometimes experiments go astray. That's completely fair, especially considering the other great U2 releases. \\"Zooropa's\\" existence may very well be the driving force for \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\"(a classic with staying power) because it forced U2 in a different direction. But please, let's not call this their best work, or even a good album. Let's recognize that it is an experiment and leave it at that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Hey, I admit it, I loved Star Trek and TNG, unlike most of the reviewers raving about this show. But I love this show too, maybe more. The blend of western and space genres works for me. I like some of the cliche-breaking, like no aliens and no sound in space. But what really makes this show work is the clever, witty writing and the suberb ensemble cast - interesting characters that interact in interesting ways. The show is not perfect, but close enough for 5 stars.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I was looking foward to seeing this movie when I first saw the TV trailer(teaser).I saw a few more trailers and that reduced to me to a mild interest. When the dvd came out I was sorry I even spent one cent on the rental. The film desperatly reaches in some way to capture the classic image and storyline of a bygone era in filmmaking. It miserably fails. Waiting for it to end was about the extent of the suspense. Gwyneth Paltrows acting was horrendous. Her blank stare and rote lines left me bored beyond comprehension. Jude Law(Sky captain)should never be considered to play any role that even remotely resembles a robust action hero. He is best suited as maybe an icecream man in a lowbudget, British troubled teens film. Angelia Jolie, who was primarily used to sell this film in clips tries , but looks lost, yearning to yank off that eye patch. The story, which is hardly explainable(or worth it)is a convoluted, heaping pile of junk. The film backfired because in its attempt to simulate good old style cliffhangers with futuristic imagery, it actually copied the worst of the films it was trying to duplicate. The old look glow that was intended to enhance the retro feel bugged my eyes out. It is not meant for prolonged viewing. The film appeared very blurry at times because of this. I would have given the movie no stars, but this review system does not allow for that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am ashamed to admit I am one of the ones that did not lock-on to FIREFLY while it was being aired. But viewing this amazing series on DVD not only makes me wish I had been an original viewer, but that Fox had the vision to see what it had and gave it more time to find an audience. A tremendous cast all around, though with extra kudos to Nathan Fillion (Mal), Morena Baccarin (the Ambassador), and (yes) Adam Baldwin (Jayne, perhaps Adam's best role to date). This show is a reminder of how science fiction in its purest form is still about people and relationships (i.e. Startrek TOC) and when writers and producers focus on this, everyone benefits. If you're a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, give this DVD boxed set a try, and be sure to go see the original motion picture SERENITY, due later this year.

015626224X|5.0|This book has become \\"Literature\\" with a capital L for the right reasons, because it's brilliant and a work of art, etc. I do not have the arrogance to use Amazon as a forum to critique a work by Orwell.<br /><br />I only want to add that I am working on several restaurants in NYC as an architect, and I have brought this book along to meetings and given several copies to clients to show them other ways of looking at their business. It is easy to talk about being in someone else's shoes when that other person is \\"down and out,\\" but Orwell manages to sympathetically explore aspects of extreme conditions with incredible empathy. And little pandering or sentimentality. It is not quit poverty he is describing as much as the driving oppression of a job -- especially in the restaurants (and hotel restaurants.)<br /><br />This is why I've discussed the book with those clients. The business has hardly changed in eighty odd years, especially in any way that means anything to the people that are working washing dishes or cleaning hotel silverware. Reading some passages and have them shocked with recognition even now is remarkable.
B00005R24K|5.0|Quality:  I had no problem with the frame of the movie but the imagery was not the best.  It was kind of fuzzy.-2 stars <br /> <br />      Movie:  The movie is very good and has a creepy feeling to it.  If you can't stand blood and guts then don't bother renting.  The movie is so gory its rated NC-17.  There are many suspensful \\"jumpy\\" parts.  Its an 80's movie made by a group of college students so don't expect any special computerized effects.  Instead there is clay animation-kind of cheesy.  The blood is also sloppily thrown in.  The movie gets 5 stars.

It has many of his famous songs and is good to listen to when your in that sixties mood. All Along The Watchtower is the standout, due in part to Bob Dylan's great lyric, but Hendrix's performance does the song justice. Other favourites are Stone Free, The Wind Cries Mary and Angel.
6305971099|3.0|I'm just wondering if I'm the only one who thought this was okay because I saw many of the people trashing it in their reviews.  Its entertaining for the first time but I would only see it once.  After being shot at a couple million times by the police Michael-then in a coma falls into a mind shaft then is carried by a raging stream.  Next a hermit picks his body up from the shore and takes care of him for a year.  Michael then wakes up from his coma on Halloween and repays the hermit by killing him and continues his pursuit on killing his niece.  Well in the ending of the last one Jamie killed someone in the house with scissors.  The Halloween series then turns more fantastical in this one.  SOMEHOW Jamie has a teleketic bond with his uncle.  So it meant Michael controlled Jamie to kill that woman and so they ruined the ending to the 4th installment.  Jamie can also tell what Michael is doing and when he is going to kill someone.<br /><br />  I'm not going to ruin the ending but seeing that I'm the only one that kind of likes it you probably should just catch it on tv usually on AMC so don't waste your money renting.<br /><br />  The acting is not so good in this one.  The teenagers  are just like the typical Friday the 13th cast.  Even Donald Pleasence seams a little enthusiac in this one but Danielle Harris gives her stronget performance.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|Okay, I bought this CD without noticing that little copy-protected sticker on the case. It's the same technology as Velvet Revolver's \\"Contraband\\" CD used, and I managed to burn that by deleting the \\"ScbpHid.dll\\" file the CD sneaks into your C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS folder, then reinserting the disc while holding down shift to prevent auto-run from working. That allows you to circumnavigate the garbling mechanism so you can rip good copies of the songs. However, for this CD I haven't had any luck... I'm not sure if they patched the program to work differently or something. <br /> <br />Either way, I don't like the direction this technology is taking music. Fair use law dictates that if you buy the rights to use this music you can use it however you want within copyright laws, which ripping for personal use does not violate. I primarily listen to music in mp3 format from my computer (faster load times, etc) and on my mp3 player (for portability). Personally I like \\"buying the mp3s\\" through buying an original copy to rip from, so as to ensure getting the best quality possible, as well as a backup if my hard drive fritzes out or something. This new copy-protection technology is unfair to law-abiding music fans and just plain annoying.

B00005JNJT|4.0|Between 1989 to 1997 four Batman movies were released with three different actors (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney) portraying the caped crusader.  We were also treated to a slew of over the top villains including the Joker (Jack Nicholson), the Penguin (Danny DeVito), Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  But, after 1997's \\"Batman and Robin\\", it seemed as if Bruce Wayne hung up his cowl and left Gotham behind.  That was until this year's \\"Batman Begins\\" was released. <br /> <br />As the movie begins, we find Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a prison far away from his family's home.  This is where he catches the eye of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who takes Bruce under his wing and brings him into the fold of Ra's Al Guhl (Ken Watanabe).  During the time of Bruce's training, we also learn a great deal about his past including the murders of his parents, his fears and his relationship with Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes).  However, when Ra's Al Guhl's true plot for Gotham is revealed, Bruce Wayne decides to return to save his beloved city. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Gotham has fallen into the clutches of some sinister evildoers.  Crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has the city under his thumb.  Add to the mix Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) whose seemingly normal patients (mostly thugs of Falcone's) are quickly diagnosed as insane.  However, there is more than meets the eye about the good doctor and it eventually becomes clear that he is only a small part of a bigger sinister plot.  Can Batman save the day? <br /> <br />While some people may have been hesitant about Christian Bale portraying Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman, he seems to be a good choice to fill the shoes of the caped crusader.  Not only does he make the character come across as somewhat realistic but also flawed. <br /> <br />Co-stars Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) are excellent as Batman's allies.  The same holds true for Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy (who originally auditioned for the title role) as one of Batman's nemesis.  When these actors appear in a movie, you expect a good performance and each one delivers with \\"Batman Begins\\".  This is especially true of Michael Caine's performance that shows more of the bond that Alfred has with Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br />The plot of the movie is also plausible.  It takes you away from the comic book feel of the previous Batman movies and seems almost realistic.  This time around, with much of the movie filmed in Chicago, the city of Gotham even looks lighter with more of a metropolitan feel.  A few nice touches to the movie are the explanations of why Bruce Wayne decided to call himself Batman, how he found the Batcave and where his weapons and the Batmobile (a lot different in this movie than in previous films) come from.  It's also good to see that Batman isn't secondary to the villains in this movie. <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" was good but there were some parts that were lacking.  It didn't seem that Bruce's relationship with Rachel added much to the plot of the movie.  This probably could have been dropped altogether or maybe some extra time might have been added for a little more chemistry between the two characters.  It would have been nice to have known a little more about Henri Ducard, who's more than he appears to be, and Earle, the character portrayed by Rutger Hauer.  <br /> <br />Plans are already underway for another Batman movie with most of the cast set to reprise their roles.  The end of \\"Batman Begins\\" should give you a clue who the villain will be in the next film.  While this isn't the greatest movie to ever come out of Hollywood, if you're looking to escape into the theater and be entertained for a couple of hours, then you won't be disappointed! <br />
B00000IQMT|5.0|I tell you: within 5 seconds! As soon as I heard the opening chords of Duel Of The Fates, I knew I was going to love this Soundtrack. <br /> <br />First, and above all, I'd like to point out that this score doesn't sound at all like the original ones from 30 years ago. Obviously not only because of the recording quality, but simply because Williams evolved since then, pretty much as any other composer.  <br />Unfortunately, this is the biggest flaw of Episode I; it doesn't recapture the sound of the originals, but neither does it establish a new Star Wars sound.  <br />Of course that doesn't diminish the quality of the soundtrack, but it is the reason why Phantom Menace ranks behind the first three scores. It is a great John Williams score, but it's not identifiably Star Wars, except for a few bright spots. <br /> <br />The theme for the trade federation is as Star Wars- like as you can get, and I firmly believe that it will be remembered as a classic, just like Anakin's Theme. <br />How the music for young Darth Vader interwines an own motif and the Imperial March is simply pure genius. <br /> <br />There are other highlights on this soundtrack: the reappearance of the noble Force theme, an even more evil statement of the Emperor's theme in \\"The Appearance Of Darth Maul\\" and the funeral music for Qui- Gon. The rest is non- thematic, typical John Williams underscore, but, like I said, on a higher level than usual. <br /> <br />Unlike other reviewers here, I strongly recommend you to buy the single disc edition instead of the Ultimate Edition. The original release provides you with comprehensive suites, unlike the 2 disc edition, which only offers the bad cut and paste jobs from the film edit. Plus, it lacks some material of the original release!
B0001WTWCO|4.0|This is very drama movie. I saw this movie first time when I was 15years old. I didnt know why but I was very impressed.   <br />  <br />I watch it around 50times so far I think, and everytime I realize new things that were not there before. <br />  <br />There was a neighbor who was around 50years old. She said to me  <br />\\"Anne of Green Gables  is worth reading many times.

I wrote I was impressed this movie for the first time but I didn't know the reason. <br /> <br />I think the older I become the more I can understand this movie. <br />May be  for the first, I was just impressed the romance between  <br />Almacy and Katharine, romantic scene of Hana and Kip.

B00007LTIB|5.0|Did you all know that it is possible to synchronize the music of 'Gates Of Delirium' to the ending of 2001 A Space Odyssey - perfectly! <br /> <br />cuz i've only just discovered it, i remember reading on the internet ages ago how both of these beauties are meant to go well with one another and that the song should be started as soon as the words 'Jupiter- far and beyond the infinite' appear, i however have tried this and it is not in time,(incedently these words should appear exactly 03:19 seconds into the song as Bill Bruford hits one of his satifying drums to start the dreamy monolith ascension sequence) i had therefore spent ages trying to work out the perfect point to start the track after failed attempts of searching for instuctions on the internet. i did this by matching the obvious highlight of the track which is the exhilarating instrumental war between the band members at around 8 minutes with the beginning of the multi-light tunnel sequence which is the highlight of the film, did some fine tuning then low and behold it actually worked, amazing! my elation at finding the perfect timing has led me to write this article and that maybe i am the first person on the internet to write proper instructions on how to discover mankinds greatest secret mystery coincidence. i would also like to know whether this is a known fact amongst people of the older generation cuz i'm only 25 and not as knowledgeable as most of ya, the fact is that i am a stoner-so this has obviously blown me away and also made me both curious and scared, the meaning to which i will explain in a minute. <br /> <br />in order to experience this audio-visual delight simply purchase a copy of Relayer on CD and the DVD of 2001 A Space Odyssey from Amazon.com, place the cd in the CD player and press play but then immeadiately pressing pause so that the time elapsed is 00:00 this will give the record an extra second to start and will therefore help to maintain accurracy in synchronisation, then of course press play on the DVD player and then when the film gets exactly 1 hour 48 minutes and 57 seconds in, (this will be the moment when dave is trying to disassemble hal with a screw driver, to be exact it is when hal says \\"I can feel it\\" for the third time), you must then immediately press play on the cd player,if you have pulled it off correctly, then the seconds on the cd player's timer should be exactly two seconds in front of the seconds on the DVD player's timer, also these seconds should be ticking alternately in perfect time with one another so in otherwords the seconds would be ticking to the sequence CD-00:02,then DVD-1:49:00,then CD 00:04,then DVD-1:49:02 etc. this may take practice to get the hang of in your stoned state of mind. now turn down the sound on the film and be amazed at how spookily each sequence goes together exact, and how many of the actual highlights of this track (which is many)get emphasised among this haunting visual display-in turn making it amusing instead of frightening. <br /> <br />an early indication of whether this experiment is going smoothly and according to plan is when the clock on the CD player is on 02:02 (eerie! especially since the clocks are ticking alernatately 02 seconds from each other-i think i think too much) this is the point in the song when a rather amusing series of notes are played on an instrument that sounds like a cross between a violin and a trombone, you should find that each note and the pitch in which they are played exactifies the head movements of Dave as he turns round to see the television that is speaking to him, this is perhaps the funniest part of the sequence as well. <br /> <br />it is hard for me to stress how many amazing coincidences you are going to discover and how this film sequence can be given a completely different story to it if you have an open enough mind and imagination, i will not ruin your experience by telling you each of the ones that i have discovered, but my personal highlight has to be during the multi-light tunnel sequence when the first flash of dave's face goes in time to Bruford's satisfying drum hit,  and how you then notice the same thing happens with the next face and then similarly with the last 2-makes me crack up every time i see it(dave with that manic look on his face).  <br /> <br />Jon Anderson will eventually sing the 'Soon' part of the song just as dave's eye turns normal colour and the song will end just as dave eats his last supper. <br /> <br />now the thing that i am curious about is whether Yes actually recorded this record purposely over the top of this film in order to mess with are heads, if they did then they surely are genius's, maybe this was a master-plan between Kubrik and Yes which they planned in order to create a mystery for us to solve, but of course if they didn't intentionally do this, then this occurance most certainly must be mankind's greatest secret mystery coincidence, what is even more eerie is how it could quite easily be debated that 2001 is film's greatest visual experience and that gates of delerium is also music's greatest listening experience and to have them going together with one another is s**t your pants scary, even more eerie is how the initials to 'Gates Of Delerium' are GOD and that the film is all about evolution, this could of course either be proof of a god by his will-matching mankind's two greatest creations with one another or it could be yes being genius's again by being clever in their naming after knowing that we will think God would have something to do with it after the spectator experiences it. or this could of course simply be another part of mankind's greatest secret mystery coincidence. <br /> <br /> <br />
0800177177|2.0|I saw this movie on the shelf at my local video store and said to myself \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula?Must mean its a faithful adaptation of the classic book. I have read some of the book and well am going to read it in its entirety soon but i know what happens in it and well have to say im disappointed in this movie. I expected a smarter version, one that truly show Bram Stoker's vision on how he viewed Dracula. Even from the opening credits, I had the eeriest feeling that i was going to be let down and well was not disappointed. My biggest pet peeve with this movie is the overplayed eroticism and nudity. I mean is a movie that far gone that you need Lucy and Mina to make out in the rain? I mean for a lot of guys that will draw them to the movie, but what about us chicks. We don't exactly get a lot of eye candy except ,in my case, Gary Oldman. Also why did they make Lucy a [prostitute]? Im every other remake of Dracula, Lucy is a bit nubile and naive but a respectable character.In this movie i was glad she died and that's not the reaction i should have about her. Another this is why did the women's breasts keep falling out of their dresses? Doesn't make much sense. Another peeve of mine is the phony accent by Keanu Reeves. Gee Golly gosh do you honestly believe that the guy that played Ted in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure could pull off an actual authentic accent. My don't directors have better sense NOT to put Keanu Reeves in a extremely serious role. I'll move on now. Another peeve is well why did they kill a baby in the begining. i mean okay i stuck with the movie until Harker(Reeves) got to the castle. Then i started to lose faith. Gary Oldman could not pull off the look of Dracula at that point in the movie. The Harker goes wandering around the castle and finds himself in the middle of a bed and these three women, who im guessing are Dracula's brides, starting dry humping and moaning all over Harker. Then Dracula shows up and gives them a baby and in turn theytear it to pieces. Thats when i decided okay cant get any worse. Well i was wrong. Thats all im going to say on the subject cause im pissing myself off thinking about. Besides i think this review is getting to long anyway. If you don't believe me go rent it yourself.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm not really a HUGE Linkin Park fan, to tell you the truth I'm more into the rap scene, but this Nu-Metal (i think) style of Linkin Park has done it for me. Here is my opinion about each song: <br /> <br />01-FOREWORD-N/A <br />02-DON'T STAY-4.5/5 (flows well with the thingy prior to this. difficult guitar sequence to play though!) <br />03-SOMEWHERE I BELONG-5/5 (i was captivated by this one. flawless) <br />04-LYING FROM YOU-4.5/5 (very nice, but i felt it was too short and the remix in collision course was better) <br />05-HIT THE FLOOR-4/5 (the sequences are structured a bit too clearly and they never say hit the floor anyway, but the chorus makes this one a 4 and not a 3.5) <br />06-EASIER TO RUN-4/5 (this one actually has meaning to it and kind of reminds me of \\"breaking the habit\\" but without the quality.) <br />07-FAINT-5/5 (my FAVOURITE track of the album. have no idea y they didnt make a video for this one) <br />08-FIGURE 09-4.5/5 (has a party feel to it. cool guitar and drum sequence, still couldnt get the chords quite right grr!) <br />09-BREAKING THE HABIT-5/5 (everybodys familiar with this one. could use a little less of chester, though.) <br />10-FROM THE INSIDE-3.5/5 (didnt really like this one as it was so similar to the rest of the songs and didnt have that touch of magic herbs and spices to it the hits and good songs had-could have been better if they tried a little harder) <br />11-NOBODY'S LISTENING-5/5 (i dont no y nobodys listening to this one. IT ROX! rap fans should peep this one. rockers probably didnt like it and i can c y. this one is rap and its a pretty good one for a song on a rock album) <br />12-SESSION-4/5 (they left this one as a beat as they probably found it too hard 2 write lyrics to. it is hard, but i managed to pull it off with some lyrics i wrote) <br />13-NUMB-5/5 (much better than the collision course remix, this is HUGE single, one of the best songs ever made in history. it goes right next to songs as lose yourself, imso fly and keep rollin'. UNFORGETTABLE.) <br /> <br />What I really enjoyed about this album is the level of quality they achieved with only 13 tracks and what a memorable album they produced without any features. NICE. Many songs here deserve to have music videos, but what the hell. It don't matter, baby. I reccommend this album to anyone, big time.

I was happy (to say the least) to hear that they are returning to the studio to record the soundtrack for their upcoming film \\"The Pick of Destiny.\\"<br /><br />I've had the good fortune of seeing the D in concert three times. If you have to, drive all the way to Cleveland to see this steaming hot band. While we wait for more of JB's killer vocals and KG's tasty guitar licks, pop in this disc and rock your socks off.

WHOS WITH ME ON THIS <br /> <br /> <br />PS: Amazon should really come up with a no star reviewing option because I really dont want to give this album one star.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is the greatest LP that the Beatles ever recorded, which is saying something. This record has everything and then some. Filled with surprises, this is as good as it gets in rock/pop music. From the downright nasty rock of \\"Come Together\\", to the insane bass lines and perfect pop of \\"Something\\", to the innovative genius of Side Two (Including what is known as \\"The Huge\\", the suite containing \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\" to \\"The End\\", there is nothing on this record that isn't representative of everything the Beatles were at their best. I could have done without \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", but I'll put up with those considering the absolute greatness of everything else. The lads made sure that the last thing they ever recorded was the best. A must for any collection.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|If you want to feel love, you should watch this movie. \\"Love Actually\\" is the greatest romantic comedy movie that I've ever seen. The film was made just before 2003 Christmas in U.K. by Richard Curtis and the story is also about some couples' happening around Christmas.      In the start of the movie, it shows us many people's hugging at an airport and Hugh Grant who is the movie's main character voices that \\"Love actually is all around.\\" and the movie starts showing us how the love is all around. You should know that this film is not about just one couple's story. There are several couples' story but the stories are not separated. They are organized partially.      The movie has two kinds of version; the original and the asian. The asian version movie doesn't have the story of love between porn actor and actress. I have an unsatisfied of this.      I strongly recommend people who want to feel love or make love to watch this movie, but if you don't have any person who you can meet, it may make you sadder because the couples who are in the film look so happy.      Plus cameos' acting makes the movie more interesting.
0975991477|5.0|Dr. Bruce Lipton brings clarity, depth of knowledge, and a sense of humor to a very serious subject and, in the process, challenges current beliefs about the power of genes to control who we are.  This is cutting-edge science written in clear, concise language.  Dr. Lipton includes his own background and experience, giving a very human dimension to the discussion. While the body of the text is well-grounded in current research, the final chapter asks us to think ahead to the possible spiritual implications of this fundamental research in cell biology.  This is a fascinating read, inviting you to think in new ways about science and about yourself.
B00005JNNZ|2.0|While basketball is used as the backdrop for the movie, it is come to my hault that Coach Carter really isn't about basketball. The real heart of the movie is in the way Coach Carter begins to turn the lives around of the players on his basketball team by showing them that someone actually cares about what happens to them after high school. <br /> <br />At one point in the movie Carter (played perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson) asks a player why he plays basketball and he responds with \\"to win the state title\\" - which of course gets him high fives from the rest of the team. Carter then asks the team who won the state title last year and nobody knows the answer. Carter tries to show his players that high school basketball is not about winning but about discipline, respect and the confidence to accomplish any goal. <br /> <br />If you are thinking about going to see Coach Carter as a basketball movie, I suggest seeing another movie, but if you want to see a truly inspiring story go see Coach Carter.  <br /> <br />If it was about Coach Carter, then the story would focus on more on the character if it was meant to be a biographical movie. Other than that, it overdid it to get attention to cycle to the life of the basketball players too.
0375703861|3.0|After the bombings in London were revealed to have allegedly been committed by suburban youth, I felt that I understood the situation better and in more depth because I had read Ms. Smith's tour de force of a debut novel.  Witty and entertaining, albeit a little loose and perhaps in need of one more edit, WHITE TEETH reminded me of a Victorian novel with a touch of Tom Robbins thrown in: myriad, seemingly disparate threads come together all tied up in a nice, neat bow at the end.  Clever language and interesting characters are icing on the cake.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Not everybody reviews things they like, or understand.  \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" really has to be seen from a kid's eye view to be grasped.  Adult commentaries don't seem appropriate for something like this.<br /><br />Having said that, and also having revealed in this review's title that I don't care much for the story itself, I was much more interested in this version of the film than its predecessor.  I should also mention that I'm generally lukewarm about Tim Burton's body of work as well.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is the film I believe Tim Burton was destined to create.<br /><br />Burton usually finds the dark side of a story to play in, but here at last he seemed to find the exact balance needed to tell this story properly.  This story is about the grotesque character types of childhood - poverty-stricken Charlie observing children over-indulged and overloaded in what they eat, what they play with, what they're presented with, and what they compete for - and Dahl's ways of showing them up for what it ultimately brings them all.  It's aimed at a child's morality and sense of justice, not an adult's.  Adults who dismiss this story as somehow sick or scary really don't get it.  But I think that perhaps Burton does.<br /><br />Charlie, himself, is wonderfully played by young master Highmore without being too gushy or syrupy.  Johnny Depp's (and I imagine Tim Burton's) version of Willy Wonka loses some of the sinister schizoid clown aspect that Gene Wilder had and replaces it with quirks associated with never quite growing up properly.  And who can ever slight David Kelly's performances in anything?  Much more fitting casting here as Grandpa Joe than Jack Albertson in the earlier version.<br /><br />The special effects are relatively tame in this film, but seem to concentrate more on it really being a factory than a theme park ride as the earlier film version of the story always strikes me (or even a psychedelic nightmare at times).  The look feels right for nowadays, and Danny Elfman's score is equally fitting and witty.<br /><br />To the reviewer who claimed that Depp played two roles, look again.  Mrs. Bucket is definitely NOT Johnny Depp, but Helena Bonham Carter, who will do the voice of the Corpse Bride (in release September, 2005) alongside Depp and under the direction of Tim Burton.<br /><br />I expected little from this film, and couldn't even talk my 17-year-old into seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised by it.  I have great difficulty getting through the earlier version with Gene Wilder without falling asleep, but this one kept me interested and involved throughout.  Give it a shot.look feels right for nowadays, and Danny Elfman's score is equally fitting and witty. <br /> <br />To the reviewer who claimed that Depp played two roles, look again.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Shallow and empty horror movie that manages to lower your I.Q. while you are watching it with a flat out horrible performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his matrix performances look Oscar worthy by comparison. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks passion for the material and not to mention professionalism and the script is by far the most offensive thing in the entire film with a very confusing story line that does not make much sense and some pretty incredible bad dialog. My heart goes out to some of the good actors in this film, who does bring their amazing talent to this waste of celluloid especially Rachel Weisz, who manages to overcome the very bad script to give a tight and powerful performance that the movie clearly does not deserved. The one star in this review goes to her for her valiant effort to give a good performance despite the horrible script and her retarded leading man.
B00005JNZ4|3.0|So many movies seem to fall on the fence between \\"see it in the theater\\" and \\"wait for DVD.\\"  This is one of those, and normally I would just recommend anyone interested to wait for it on DVD or cable, but this has been one of the worst movie summers in memory, so my recommendation is a bit different.  If, like me, you've been upset by the incredible lack of decent films to see this summer, you might want to give this one a look.  It isn't great, but neither is it unwatchable.  All in all, it is a pleasant enough way to waste ninety minutes.<br /><br />Though the ads present this as a Diane Lane-John Cusack vehicle, this is very much a Diane Lane film.  The film is largely told from her point of view, the narrative is situated in her world, and she gets most of the screen time.  There is no problem with this if you like Diane Lane, but those who are excited about a new John Cusack film should moderate their expectations.  Both are good in their roles, though together they generate a lot less chemistry than I would have liked, largely because of many awkward turns in the script.  Indeed, much of the film is hurt by poor execution on the production side.  While there are many funny moments, and several satisfyingly reflective ones, as a rule the movie is a tad on the flat side.  Scenes drag on too long or are curtailed too quickly, something that in the end is the result of either poor direction or poor editing (poor writing can be dealt with by a director).  There are several poorly written scenes.  So, many good moments are offset by many weak moments.  This all undermines efforts of a strong overall cast.  In addition to Lane and Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Elizabeth Perkins, and Stockard Channing were all excellent in their roles.<br /><br />This should have been a better movie than it turned out being.  There is a great cast, and the topic of the difficulty of over-40 dating is one that is increasingly relevant as the Baby Boomers all age.  There is a bit of disingenuousness in the central conceit.  Diane Lane is presented as dating a somewhat younger man, but the fact is that John Cusack is only a year younger than she is.  A great deal could have been done with the lying and deception that takes place as people present themselves over the Internet.  Still, despite the shortcomings of the film, it is one of the more palatable options we have seen recently in theaters.  You can do worse.disingenuousness in the central conceit.

0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris, The End of Faith (Norton, 2004)<br /><br />Before you read this review, please go order a copy of The End of Faith. For that matter, order multiple copies to give out as Christmas presents (both because you want everyone you know to read this book, and to revel in the irony).<br /><br />Thank you. Now that you have done so, on to the review.<br /><br />I find it amusingly ironic that the word I kept coming up with to describe Sam Harris, while mulling over what to say in this review, was \\"prophet.\\" Harris would probably slap me upside the head himself for making such a claim, especially in light of his thesis here: that the problems the world currently suffers vis-a-vis terrorism (and has suffered throughout history in many forms) is not because of \\"extremism\\" or \\"fundamentalism\\"-- the problems the world currently suffers spring, fully formed, from religion itself. He then goes on to spend about two hundred pages telling us exactly why he believes this. I can't imagine that the majority of readers who have brains won't be reading this and thinking either \\"I've been saying this for years\\" or \\"I wish I'd thought of this.\\"<br /><br />Documented in exhaustive (and sometimes excruciating) detail, and using sometimes assailable but always compelling logic, Harris outlines the problems with religion throughout history, and more importantly (perhaps) why religion is even more of a problem today than it is usually. He loses a step in the final chapter, in which he proposes a spiritual alternative to religion, but I'm guessing few people will have as much of a problem with the idea as I did; Harris is not far off when he talks about the comfort of religion for the common man, and it does stand to reason that they'll need something of perceived worth to replace it.<br /><br />Perhaps even more amusingly ironic is that two of the three blurbs on the back of the book come from prominent religious figures. One wonders if they actually read it, as the book's whole premise is to tell them much of what they've based their lives on is completely illegitimate.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough; it should be on your short shelf of sacred texts with Peele's The Diseasing of America and Howard's The Death of Common Sense. Oh, there I go using religious terms again. **** ½'s whole premise is to tell them much of what they've based their lives on is completely illegitimate.  <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough; it should be on your short shelf of sacred texts with Peele's The Diseasing of America and Howard's The Death of Common Sense.

B000002UAR|5.0|\\"Revolver\\" by The Beatles - 5 out of 5 stars -    In 1965, The Beatles were already the biggest band in the world by far and had just released \\"Rubber Soul\\", their most sonically complex record - using backward sounds, constant overlays and overdubs over the basic studio tracks, and foreign and orchestral instrumentation - in short, their expanding drug use and Bob Dylan were influencing their work more and more and engineer Geoff Emerick and producer George Martin were well suited to keep pace with the Fab Four's adventurous new mindset (witness \\"Norwegian Wood\\", with its famously unorthodox sitar augmentation, and \\"In My Life\\", reflecting the Lennon/McCartney team's most mature and insightful lyrics yet.) However, the following year they would outdo themselves and everyone else...again...with the stunning \\"Revolver\\".    \\"Revolver\\", their next album and often cited as their best, fittingly opens with George Harrison's bitter and sardonic  rocker \\"Taxman\\". Harrison has three songs on the album and all of them were starting to show the latent talent that would later rival Lennon and McCartney's best work. Paul's blistering solo also was the most flat-out rock that the Beatles had ever been up to that point. The next track, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", is even more dramatic departure. Featuring no regular instruments or drums and only Paul and John's voice on the depressingly morose tale of a lonely woman, it signaled the next major step in their lyrical and musical evolution. Yet more sarcasm and trademark humor is found on John's \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", featuring the Taxman solo backwards and plenty of other overdubs. These tracks alone forever altered the idea that the Beatles were a mere pop band, and were evidence that they had begin to assimilate the pot-enhanced ideas of their contemporaries and reproduce them on record to a much better degree than any of them.    \\"Love You To\\" was another George track, again showing his growth as a writer. Paul's elegant \\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\" was notable for its orchestral additions. \\"Yellow Submarine\\", of course, featured Ringo giving his best vocal performance yet, and the wonderful use of sound effects by emerick and Martin really sold the song's chipper lyrics and atmosphere. \\"She Said, She Said\\" shows John rounding into peak form, with acid inspired lyrics spoken to him at a crazy house party (\\"She said, I know what it's like to be dead.\\"). \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is perhaps my least favorite song on the album, and it's simplistic nature is out of place here. But the following track, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", was a typically catchy warning on the dangers of materialism, further evidence of the influence of marijuana and eastern culture and the changing American culture of the time.    For my money, the strongest tracks are the five closing ones. \\"For No One\\" yet again shows the uncanny ability of McCartney to blend sadness with melody, as the song tells of a crumbling marriage and contains some brilliant and stirring instrumentation in the bridge. \\"Doctor Robert\\" is John's searingly funny and sarcastic rocker about the infamous \\"drug peddler to the stars\\". \\"I Want To Tell You\\" continues the sadness-melody theme, this time done by George (\\"I want to tell you, I feel hung up and I don't know why\\"). \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" is Paul's response to tripping on LSD (\\"I was alone, I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there\\"), with the blaring horns again demonstrating the inherent playfulness of all these songs.    Speaking of drug use, there is the final and easily the most stunning of all the songs on \\"Revolver\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (the title based on a famous malpropism by Ringo Starr). The best possible description of a drug trip ever put on record, with shrieking seagulls and Paul's backwards laughing dubbed over a powerful rock lick and killer drum beat beat - both also inserted backwards - and with lyrics that Lennon found in drug guru Timothy Leary's version of The Tibetan Book Of The Dead on meditation (\\"Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream - it is not dying\\"). This track alone forever altered what was possible to achieve in the studio at the time, for ANY band, and was a major influence on the later Beatles work - echoes of it can be heard all the way from \\"A Day In The Life\\" on the next masterpiece Sgt. Pepper to the maddeningly obtuse \\"Revolution #9\\" from The White Album.     Revolver remains The Beatles' best overall album to me, for all these reasons. If I meet someone who is not overly familiar with the Beatles' work and they wish to know more, I frequently give them \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" back-to-back to start with, and then they can go either backwards into the pop era or forward into the psychedelic era as they wish. Harrison once remarked that RS and Revolver could play as a double album and its hard not to agree with that assessment when heard that way. Of the two however, Revolver remains the most accomplished and cohesive record, not just for The Beatles themselves but possibly for all of rock history. Its overwhelming influence on contemporaries and future generations cannot be underestimated.

Mickey Rourke is dirty and adorable as usual but I wish he'd speak clearer (he mumbles his lines.)  This movie was part detective, part noir ,part occult, and very humid New Orleans.  I enjoyed it, but it has to be watched more than once or twice.

B000002H38|5.0|I fell in love with this album after purchasing it because \\"Sweet Love\\" was my favorite radio single and I needed to hear more. I bought the vinyl album in 1986 because I thought the cold sound of cd's was just a phase and would disappear(!). I realized a couple of years later that the opposite was happening and I needed to convert as many albums as I could to the cd format, \\"Rapture\\" included. Panning forward to 1997 and Anita signed to Warner Brothers with no new album in sight and \\"Rapture\\" getting re-released on Electra's home label, I was curious as to Warner's version of this album. I waited until a few months ago to purchase a new copy of \\"Rapture\\" because it was dirt cheap and already owning the initial pressing of this cd, I had to somehow justify my actions. Comparing the 1986 release on Electra to the 1997 release on Warner, Electra's is better. I thought Warner would at least remaster this cd, it's 1997 for god sakes. The 1986 version is cleaner and more open, Warners is a bit muted. So, if you think the \\"new\\" version of this album is a remaster, save your money 'cause it ain't so. Anita's hits cd features the sound that \\"Rapture\\" could have been.
B000003TA4|5.0|how can some of you people sit there and say that nirvana sucks and didn't change music?  don't you guys get it?!?!  this album came out 15 years ago, and we are still debating, praising, and discussing it!!  whether nirvana sucked or not, the fact is that the album is still generating a ton of hype, and its ranked like #270ish on the amazon.com sales!  this for an album that came out 15 years ago and some of you just want to dismiss it as garbage that did nothing for the music industry?  this website should be proof enough that nirvana was an incredible force in music, and for a reason.  so stop denying it to yourselves. <br /> <br />yes, it is true that nirvana was not the first of its kind.  in fact, alice in chains released their cd even before nirvana did.  and bands like bad religionand the red hot chili peppers  were making innovative music throughout the 80's before nirvana was even around.  however, had nirvana not broken through and become so wildly famous and successful music would not have changed right then and there when it did.  i'm actually certain that we would have endured at least a few more years of 80's screeching hair metal.  i'm sorry, i know some of you guys like it, but i personally can't stand it.  nirvana was it, they had it all, they were the formula needed to change music.  yes, alice in chains and pearl jam were around, but without nirvana, these bands had nothing to pave the way and their music would not have become popular and would have fallen on deaf ears. <br /> <br />the very day that nevermind was released, curt kobain had been evicted from his crusty apartment because he could not pay the rent.  nevermind changed everything.  i believe that the success of nevermind was largely unanticipated.  when big-money producers and execs began to see nevermind take off, they thrust kurt into the spotlight.  he was on mtv, and his name was everywhere.  he appeared on the cover of rolling stone  magazine wearing a home made t-shirt that said\\"corparate magazines still suck.\\"    <br /> <br />his fame and success happened so rapidly and unexpectedly that he did not realize what was happening to himself, his band, and the image and direction that he wanted for the band. he did not say no to big money and endorsements and the corporations.  but in the end, i believe this is what killed him.  the fame, the money.  everything had happened so fast he did not stop to think that maybe this was not what he had really wanted (i know there are websites that show his suicide note, which gives you an idea of what really went on).  i think he eventually hated what he had become but it was too late to turn back. <br /> <br />kurt cobain's death left nirvana on high note.  i know that sounds bad, but imagine if kurt cobain didn't die and nirvana continued to produce albums throughout the nineties.  none would be as good or would have the same effect as nevermind and they would just end up being old washed up has-beens.   <br /> <br />so there!  hopefully you get it now, but this is an absolutely amzing album, and yes, it did impact music.  it changed the sound of popular music as we know it today.

I don't need to repeat the first review. It is a great story that (like the first reviewer indicates) that gives you enough of the misery that exists in India and also makes an entertaining novel as well. Two hours well spent. The author is humorous, educated and knows his country and people intimately.Sad,well-constructed and funny. Thank you from Canada.

Anne died in the hideous death camp at Belsen.<br /><br />In this remarkably intimate and beautifully written classic , Anne documents the two years in hiding - how they survived , amusing observances about the different residents of the house , as well as her own remarkable development , such topics as her sexuality and the development of her relationship with Peter Van Daam , as well as her sparkling brilliant intellect.<br /><br />She reveals the peculiarities and personalities of the people who live with her in the annexe , in a series of accounts and amusing anecdotes.<br /><br />One could ask why the Nazis brought about the death of this good , intelligent and charming child. One should ask what moves man to commit such horrors. What moved the Nazis to kill over a million Jewish children. What moves people  to justify the murder of Jewish children in Israel today by Arab terrorists , or to justify the monstrous tyrannies in North Korea, Red China, Zimbabwe or Iran?<br /><br />The book can equip young people to answer the questions that will be thrown at them today: Why did the Nazis do what they did? Why did the people of Europe allow it to happen? Why do we need the State of Israel?<br /><br />We are living in time when values are distorted , moral relativity and the inversion of the truth are the order of the day.

B000003TA4|5.0|THis album is great.  I don't care what you say.  Call me a poser but you'll only be trying to convince yourself your better than me.  I don't care because I love this cd.  I grew up on it.  When my dad was unemployed and I was 18 months old, I'd stay home with him and he would hang out listening to music while I would go off exploring the house.  The soundtrack to my life back then was this cd the meat Puppet albums my dad had amassed and Soul Asylum,  These bands remain some of my favorites.  And why is that?  Because I have an open mind.  Having an open mind is the only way to listen to true music, and by true music I mean art.  People who listen to music to impress people make me laugh.  I listen to music for the reason it exists know.  For enjoyment.

0465011020|5.0|A tremendous look inside \\"The Hermit Nation\\".   <br /> <br />Chol-Hwan and his editor bring to life the hell on earth that is North Korea and it's brutal prison camps.  The discriptive passages bring NK to life and his excellent use of imagery make you feel as if you're there with him, trying to keep warm through the long winters, or scratching for insects to nourish himself. <br /> <br />The book outlines his Grandparents path from Japan to NK through his internment, to his escape to China and ultimately life in South Korea. <br /> <br />I finished this book in three sittings and could barely put it down.  One of the most compelling books I've ever read.  Can't recommend it highly enough. <br /> <br />
1400034779|4.0|First a bit of perspective. In terms of purchasing power parity, you might be a bit surprised to know that Botswana's per capita income of $7,400 per year is comparable to South Africa and higher than that of Bolivia, Brazil, India, China, Iran, Lebanon, and Jordan. (the U.S. figure is $34,280; Luxembourg is tops at $48,560). Like Luxembourg, Botswana's democratic government has maintained a budget surplus for more than a decade. Botswana's population is 1.6 million; the median age is only 19.1 years. The country covers an area roughly the size of Afghanistan.<br /><br />This is the land where Precious Ramotswe establishes her detective agency. McCall Smith paints her with simple strokes, in a tinted misty atmosphere, essentially impressionistic, often generating pleasant tensions between the realities of everyday life---it's time to eat the pumpkin---and the thrill of the hunt. A romantic to the core, McCall Smith glories in the beauty and comfort of a land where prosperity is still measured by the number of cattle in your herd, where large corrals mark the center of town, and where tribal dialects note your heritage but not your class.<br /><br />The format----in effect, a children's book-----conveys the author's infectious enthusiasm for an idyllic Botswana, a place that is non-threatening, drowsy, without war, without tyranny, without Madonna or Brittney, without Disney, the sort of comfy place one finds within the pages of a nice summer beach book.

Bradley takes an original twist on the familiar Arthurian saga, which has now become familiar to the historical fiction section of bookstores everywhere. The only thing that bothered me was Morgaine's narration; it grated on me that she interjected these passages from seemingly nowhere that did little to further plot or character development, and her caveat at the beginning explaining that she has the Sight (which is why she is recounting conversations and events at which she ws not present) distracted me from being able to enjoy the book as fiction.
055321263X|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber liked the story so much he has based his latest musical on it; you can see it now in London. Literary experts have called it, the very first mystery novel. The book jacket says it is \\" A gripping tale of murder, intrigue, madness, and mistaken identity\\". Never out of print since its publication over 140 years ago, the Modern Library Classic introduction to the book tells us: \\"The Woman in White has lasted, to our great pleasure, because it is a superb storytelling about people who engage our minds and imaginations.\\"<br /><br />The above facts speak to some of the reasons  The Woman in White is considered a literary classic. To be sure, The Book Club enjoys including an occasional classic in its repertoire. Sort of like training wheels, somehow we seem to believe the reading of select classics will assist our powers of discrimination and taste. However, unlike the timeless pieces of Shakespeare and Twain, the challenge confronting today's reader of the very first mystery novel is to be able to appreciate the work's creativity long after other writers have honed the genre to a point where an original, even a great one, can seem a bit hackneyed.<br /><br />The Woman in White may not have been as exciting as The Big Sleep or even The DaVinci Code. But, after reading it, we were left with no doubt as to whose shoulders Chandler and Brown were standing when they achieved their great heights.

0156027321|5.0|You can measure the diameter of a circle. You can measure its radius. You can even measure area. And, if you are careful, you can measure circumference. But you can't really measure pi. Oh, you can estimate pi by calculation, but you can't get an exact fix on it. Pi is, as they say in mathematics, an irrational number. As opposed to rational numbers, irrational numbers go on, and on, and on, forever. Put it another way, belief in pi, requires a bit of imagination. None the less, who here would argue that pi does not exist? This is where it gets interesting. When you say that the circumference of a circle is pi times its diameter, you have to have faith in the existence of pi.  Faith is just that, believing in the irrational.<br /><br />To believe or not to believe, that is the question. Is it nobler in the mind to accept the irrational concept of pi or to suffer the outrageous fortune of trying to prove what amounts to a circular argument? Well, using that same logic, Yann Martel is here to tell you that you have a choice. You can either believe in the irrational myth of Richard Parker or you can go on trying to explain the unexplainable. Get it? Without faith, it's pretty tough to function in an irrational world.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, despite what you may have read about him, Einstein was not an atheist. However, he did believe that God was irrational. Go figure.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|when i first got this cd i had already heard the first 2 songs, holy wars and hanger 18. i must not have let it grow on me enough because i didnt like it all that much. i never heard the orignal so i couldnt tell you where the vocals were replaced and how it sounds, but i think dave sounds pretty good on this overall. i now love all the songs, including the demos and my creation (although a metal song about frankinstein's bride is a little questionalble). the demos are a little different from the originals. i really dont know what makes me like them as much as i do. dawn patrol is a little... song i guess, about air pollution. its just a bass line and dave or someone rapping but it makes laugh, and i dont mean that in a bad way either. i just think it sounds pretty funny, especially the little rat squealing thing at the end. holy wars i a classic and hangar 18 is one of my favorites, the solo battle type thing at the end is awesome, but i love what the song is written about as i am very interested in aliens, government conspiricies, ect. take no prisoners is an awesome war song. poison was the cure is way too short but still great and all the other songs are also excellent. so, if your a fan of thrash and you dont have this, you may want to give yourself a new title.
1881273989|4.0|I read the original THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES by Dr. Gary Chapman when I was a single freshman in college. I don't remember what inspired me to pick up the book, given that the tagline was \\"How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,\\" but I couldn't put it down. I read it in one all-night sitting, crying my way through the sections that illuminated and explained tension I'd had in specific relationships with family and friends. It was dark outside but light bulbs were going off inside my head all night. <br /> <br />\\"Aha! His primary love language is Acts of Service! No wonder he gets so frustrated when we kids don't help around the house.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Quality time! That's what she values, not my professions of appreciation and friendship.\\" <br /> <br />Based on its applicability to my own life, I immediately determined that Chapman's ideas about there being five love languages were spot-on. And so did about a zillion other people since he has sold approximately that number of books. If you're one of the few people who has no clue what I'm talking about when I say the five love languages, let me explain. <br /> <br />In Chapman's theory, there are five ways in which people express and understand love. These five \\"languages\\" are Acts of Service, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch. Chapman believes that while some people can often express and understand love in any number of these languages, we all have a primary love language through which we are most comfortable expressing and receiving love. He goes on to say that tension in relationships often stems from not understanding the other person's primary love language --- not understanding how the other person is communicating their love and how that person needs to be communicated to in order to understand they are loved. <br /> <br />Though Chapman originally framed his teaching on the love languages in the context of marriage, it quickly became clear that people in all stages of lifewere connecting with the concept of the languages. And over the last several years, he has tailored his message for different groups in books including THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES OF CHILDREN, THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES OF TEENAGERS, THE LOVE LANGUAGES OF GOD, and now, THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES. <br /> <br />The United States has more singles that any other nation in the world except for India and China. Four out of every ten Americans are single, so it makes sense that Chapman would choose to address this large audience. In THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES the core teaching of the original book stays intact but he shapes his message for singles of all stripes --- never married, divorced, widowed, separated, and single parents --- by including anecdotes of the unmarried dealing with various relationship issues. <br /> <br />My one complaint about this book is that the bulk of the anecdotes still seem to revolve around romantic relationships and the looming specter of marriage. A couple of chapters are dedicated to the application of the love languages with roommates, co-workers, family members, etc., but in the chapters that deal with each of the love languages in detail, the illustrations revolve around dating relationships. That's not bad per se, but I would have liked to see more diversity in the types of relationships (i.e. best friends, classmates) that are addressed here. <br /> <br />Having said that, the five love languages themselves continue to ring true in my experience and their adaptation for the single audience is welcome. I highly recommend THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES to anyone who would like to improve communication with the people in his or her life. Chapman himself writes: <br /> <br />\\"My desire for the single who reads this book is that you will learn both to receive and find love in all five love languages. I am assuming that those who take time to read a book on love desire to become better persons, to have better relationships, and to reach their potential of leaving a positive impact on the world. It is my sincere belief that learning to speak and understand the five love languages will help you reach that objective.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel
B00006IU73|5.0|One of the fun things about being a pretentious metal nerd is observing how Opeth and Porcupine Tree influence each other.  If you listen closely, it is obvious when Steve Wilson enters the Opeth scene in \\"Blackwater Park\\"; remember \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\"?  And of course the whole \\"Damnation\\" album is taking its cues from the Porcupine, as are songs like \\"A Fair Judgment\\" on the  \\"Deliverance\\" album. <br /> <br />Well, Steve Wilson picked up a few tricks of his own from Opeth.   I chuckled to myself when I heard some of the familiar Opeth chord progressions worked into songs like \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" and whatever track 6 is called.  The result of this Porcupine + Opeth cocktail makes for a great alternative hard rock record with some  definite heroin moments, (see the Cult of Luna review). <br /> <br />Think of it this way: it's an Opeth CD that still rocks but that you can play around your normal friends without them saying \\"Oh my God...\\"

Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster. This is fresh material for the show \\" Mystery Science Theater 3000\\" and I hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is.

B0006L16N8|2.0|X&Y represents Coldplay's failed attempt to imitate the sound and energy that characterized their first two albums.  During the recording of X&Y, the band recorded and re-recorded songs, over and over, in an attempt to get them \\"just right,\\" sometimes trashing months, or even years of work.  My guess is that the reason for the re-recording was to implement a conscious or unconscious desire to make the songs sound more like the ones on Rush of Blood to the Head and Parachutes.  And that's what you get on X&Y -- a group of songs that try, but fail, to rise to the level of excellence of the songs on the other two albums. <br /> <br />The production of the album also contributes to its mediocrity.  The album was produced with what sounds like an intent to highlight Chris Martin's voice over the rest of the band's instruments.  Probably an attempt by the producer (or Capitol Records) to capitalize on Mr. Paltrow's tabloid fame and movie-star good looks.  Some of the songs sound as if Martin is singing along to a karoke track, his sometimes whiney falsetto drowing out the music underneath.  I'd be a little annoyed at how my work was portrayed on this CD if I was one of the other band members.  <br /> <br />X&Y is the album Coldplay thought the public wanted.  Judging by the somewhat puzzling and startlingly consistent positive reviews you see here and elsewhere, it seems that the public has bought it hook, line and sinker.  Next time, let's hope Coldplay advances rather than stagnates, and records a good album rather than one that they think everyone will like. <br /> <br />I gave X&Y two stars though, because it does show brief glimmers of a band advancing their sound.  The harmonies at the end of \\"Fix You,\\" which is the only song on the CD that is even remotely memorable (aside from \\"Speed of Sound,\\" which is memorable only because it sounds like a slow and thoroughly uninteresting remake of \\"Clocks\\"), are innovative, lush, and very enjoyable to listen to.  You just have to labor though the first few minutes of the song to get to them, and then they only last for a few minutes.  The existence of moments like this on X&Y give me hope that everything is not lost for this band.  Hopefully they'll overcome this third-album slump and wow us the next time around.
B000025RX4|5.0|Greeted with much hoopla when released in 1970, Johnny Winter And united the blues guitarist sensation with guitarist/songwriter Rick Derringer. It was a successful pairing, resulting in the immortal classic \\"Rock And Roll, Hootchie Koo\\". A powerful quartet with solid material for the period.  As you might expect, stunning guitar work.  Mostly hard blues rock; but a cover of Steve Winwood's somber \\"No Time To Live\\", the introspective \\"Am I Here?\\", and \\"Let The Music Play\\" lend the album balance.  A mostly forgotten great album from an unfortunately short lived group.

He develops characters that refuse to lie flat on the page and paints his scenes without adjective overkill.  The story flows smoothly and kept me with it for all 600 pages and that's saying something.  Before finishing this one, I already made a trek to the bookstore to pick up two of his other books to take on vacation with me next week.  The problem is that if they are anything like American Gods, I'll have them finished before reaching the beach.<br /><br />I can't recommend it enough.  Spend the time, enjoy the journey.

B000005RFI|5.0|30+ years ago \\"Paranoid\\" was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world, the second album for Black Sabbath after their debut album \\"Black Sabbath\\". The late 60s and early 70s were a great time for experimentation, and rock was heading all over the place as various groups pushed the limits of what rock could be and where it could lead.<br /><br />Paranoid remains a good album after 30+ years, a remarkable feat. \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man\\" are considered primers for metal music, which we called hard rock in those ancient days, with a very basic bass, lead guitar, and drums sound, and the gritty, earthy voice of the Oz-man.<br /><br />Of course some parents and many religious leaders pounced on the group's name and some of their lyrics. On the other hand, the current-day version of these same people complain that Harry Potter promotes witchcraft.<br /><br />The lyrics in this album are mild, almost mainstream by today's standards. Furthermore, the lyrics are not all that breakthrough or novel, but when the lyrics are coupled with the music and Ozzy's voice, you have what was in 1971 a breakthrough album that sold very well, in spite of nearly zero radio play (except on the infamous, but not really, underground FM stations).<br /><br />What else is on this album? \\"Planet Caravan\\" is a spacey tune that is a psychedelic rock holdover from the late 60s. I enjoy this song with its synthesized voice and mellow mood. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is another hard rocker in the vein of \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man.\\" The transition in this song is solid hard rock, bridging a relatively slow beginning to a brief lead guitar solo that takes off into a screamer...and then back to the slow beat of the intro. Ozzy is nearly singing a dirge at the beginning and end of the song, but that's also the point of the song.<br /><br />\\"Hand of Doom\\" starts with the bass, adding drums and then Ozzy's voice. After the intro the lead guitar thrusts into the song and Ozzy starts putting himself into the song. The song switches back and forth between the bass/drums/mellow Oz to heavy bass, lead guitar, drums and Ozzy's full voice. Then the song suddenly changes so that it's almost like a completely different song, another hard rocker that may be the most metal song on the CD. Then about two minutes from the end of the song the speed slows down in a reprise of the beginning. By the way, this song is about drugs; the images are not positive.<br /><br />Next you've got \\"Rat Salad.\\" This song is an instrumental, the excellent drum work (turn up the bass!) setting you up for the last song.<br /><br />I love \\"Fairies Wear Boots.\\" I realize the lyrics are borderline corny, but on the other hand here's Ozzy singing about somebody who's clearly having a trip (chemically induced). Fortunately for many of us, the song is all the trip we need and the chemistry set is not required. This song is fun and good and has excellent riffs and bass.<br /><br />Music has changed a lot in 30 years. But some things remain the same. This album is one of them.

B000268QB2|5.0|Sorry, folks, but I can't agree with the comparisons. A group that uses no guitars and has a lead singer with an angelic voice can't sound like Coldplay or Radiohead. Keane is essentially a ballad band, but an excellent one. There is nothing new in the kind of music they make, any forty-something like me will enjoy it and wonder where he has heard something like it before. Keane sounds a lot like the Raspberries when they did their softer songs such as \\"I Saw The Light\\" or Badfinger doing \\"Midnight Caller\\". One remarkable exception is \\"Sunshine\\", a great pop tune which has an 80's feel reminiscent of bands like Tears for Fears. I wonder whether this album will become one of those classics that makes you think years from now: \\"they never topped that one\\". Most of the songs here could be hits. This is probably the best new album by a new group that I have heard in recent years, but I can't help being amazed at the wonders good marketing can do: is this being sold as a \\"new\\" brand of rock music? For my money, these are just good old radio-friendly ballads  under a cool guise.

There was some use of english slang that went over my head, but I thought I was getting the gist of it!

B000002ITW|5.0|This is a very, very good album.  After so many years, it's easy to forget what a big splash CSN&Y made.  Each member has great moments here.  Of the accoustic songs, my favorites include the Lee Shore, Cowgirl in the Sand, Black Queen.  There is also great group work in the accoustic set.  I love \\"On the Way Home.\\"  On this and on \\"Find the Cost of Freedom,\\" the guitar work with Stills and Young is outstanding.  They play so well together.  There are many other great moments featuring great vocals (Nash is really consistent) and great guitar work.<br /><br />I also love the electric music.  They give an outstanding performance on \\"Southern Man.\\"  The vocals are a bit soft here and there, but as the song proceeds they get better and better and are very emotional.  Again, the guitar work of Stills and Young is incredible.  My guess is a lot of people have forgotten what an excellent guitarist Stills is.  Stills and Young listen to each other and give and take (not just when they're exchanging licks either).  \\"Carry On\\" is also outstanding.  Again, the vocals start off a bit shakey.  But, by the time they get to the change, the four part harmonies are great.  Crosby plays some darn decent rhythm guitar.  Stills and Young again play incredibly well together.  If you like any of these guys, you must own this album.

B000001DYJ|4.0|ALIVE III(1993). KISS' third live record. <br /> <br />There have been several legendary bands out there-The Beatles,Aerosmith,Led Zeppelin,Van Halen,among others,and of course,there is KISS. KISS have put out several live records to this date-and how does their third live record,ALIVE III,measure up? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This record,while it may not have been ALIVE I or Alive II,is the best career spanning live record KISS has ever put out. When KISS released this album in 1993,they had been big for exactly eighteen years,so even though Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were no longer accompanying Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley when this record was made(for those of you who are new to KISS,Frehley and Criss rejoined the group in 1996 and,at different times,both departed from the group in the early 00's),this live album still turned out really good. The lead guitarist in KISS when this album came out was Bruce Kulick,who,in my opinion,was the most talented out of the replacement guitarists KISS has ever had(the remaining replacement guitarists of KISS have been Vinnie Vincent,Mark St. John,and Tommy Thayer,who is their current guitarist)and Eric Singer was their drummer at the time(Singer is also currently their drummer. This album opens with the live version of CREATURES OF THE NIGHT,which sounds killer when it is performed live(Bruce Kulick's guitar work and Eric Singer's drumming on this track are both really good)and that is followed by the live version of DEUCE,a song off of KISS' first album--Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer may not be Ace Frehley or Peter Criss,and the KISS without make-up may not be the KISS without make-up,but both Kulick and Singer do quite a good job at accompanying Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley on this track,and the whole band performs with a lot of energy on this track. As for the other moments on here--well,Gene Simmons helps bring the live version of UNHOLY to life,you feel a little bit of \\"magic\\" when you hear I WAS MADEFOR LOVIN' YOU performed live(I know--Ace Frehley,Peter Criss,make-up,and costumes aren't accompanying Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley on this track-it may seem weird that I say there is magic on the live version of this track--but to me,it sounds true),Eric Singer does a great job at kicking off the live version of I LOVE IT LOUD with his drums just like Eric Carr did on the original studio version of that song on CREAUTURES OF THE NIGHT--in the meantime,the show closes nicely with Bruce Kulick performing STAR SPANGLED BANNER by himself on guitar(awesome job at the guitar part,Bruce!)--I really don't need to say more about this live album itself,but here's another bonus about it:the liner notes are VERY cool. They(the liner notes)feauture pictures of Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Bruce Kulick,and Eric Singer live and in concert(as well as a picture of them together--the pictures of them live and in concert are pictures of Simmons,Stanley,Kulick,and Singer standing away from each other)as well as other rare photos.You even get a thing that shows all of the bands Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,Peter Criss,Eric Carr,Vinnie Vincent,Mark St. John,Bruce Kulick,and Eric Singer were in before/after KISS,the people who they were in the bands with,as well as lines that show what band a certain band member went to after they had left a certain band--now how cool is that?? Very Cool!! <br /> <br />Overall,an excellent live record. The only reason why I am knocking off one star here is because when KISS released this live record overseas,they included a live performance of the song TAKE IT OFF that originally appreared on REVENGE,but they did NOT include the live version of that song here--VERY irritating for loyal and die-hard KISS fans living in America. But otherwise,everything else here meausures up pretty well--check this live album out. You won't be dissapointed.

B0000029GA|5.0|What could I possibly say about \\"Illmatic\\" that the other 450 reviewers haven't said already. Where do you start with an album that has been hailed time and time again, as the best hip-hop album of the 90s. It's a crowing achievement that Nas rests his reputation on comfortably. I was never into rap back in the mid-90s, so subsequently, I slept on this album up until 3 weeks ago. I finally decided to pick it up after I read an interview with one of my favorite [underground] rappers, Mr. Lif. He was grouping Nas \\"Illmatic\\" with classics from Public Enemy and BDP as some of his favorite rap albums of all time. I guess I never got into rap in the mid-90s because I didn't think it was all that great. I was never a very big fan of Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\" or Snoop Dogg's work (although they undoubtedly have their strong points). Needless to say, I'm happy that Nas brought back the street poet aesthetic that hip-hop needed. Not that Nas is completely different from the bunch. He recruited the best jazz-rap producers in the biz, including Q-Tip, Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and Large Professor. The beats are strong, and Nas' lyrics are rough and tough. He really brings rap back to the hardcore street style of Rakim, Chuck D, and Gang Starr. Most importantly, Nas brands himself as a highly literate street poet. The lyrics are observatory reactions to everyday life. His outlook is more interesting than what a lot of emcees bring to the table. Without a doubt, Nas is an emcee's emcee. His fluid flow is nothing less than addictive ear candy for yours truly.<br /><br />You will hear a lot of hip-hop heads going on about how 1994 was the year for hip-hop. I have never understood that. 1988 was the year for rap. But after hearing a record like \\"Illmatic\\", I can see where they are coming from. Although I can't honestly say that this stuff is more groundbreaking than Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Ice-T, Beastie Boys etc.. I will say that Nas has made something that stands strongly next to those talents. But to think that this is more groundbreaking than some records from 1987 or 1988 is a bit ridiculous. Nas might have a state of the art flow, but the beats are hardly groundbreaking (not to say they're bad, because they're great).<br /><br />Since rap moved it's way into the mainstream by the mid-90s, \\"Illmatic\\" was pretty successful on the charts. \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\" reached number 3, \\"One Love\\" and \\"The World Is Yours\\" reached number 6 and \\"Half Time\\" reached number 8. That's pretty substantial for a hip-hop record back then. But I would have to say my favorite cut would be \\"Life's a Bi*ch\\".<br /><br />Nas came in at the right time to stir up the music industry. It was a positive step away from the Chronic-era that brought things back to brass tactics. I can fully understand why this album is at the top of every hip-hop heads top 10 list. But I have a bigger question. Who the hell is going to save us from the bling-bling era of rap. Seriously, is mainstream rap dead? If you ask me, yes, yes it is. It's sad that people hate rap because of the horrible reputation it's been given by artists like Cam'Ron, Chingy, Nelly, and countless other (c)rap artists. That's the way I felt until I discovered underground rap. Rap is still alive, and artists like Atmosphere, Eyedea & Abilities, Brother Ali, Binary Star, Company Flow (El-P), Mr. Lif, Edan, Latyrx, Lyrics Born, Aesop Rock, Sage Francis...etc are as real as it gets. And if you ask this reviewer, the new underground hip-hop brought forth by labels such as Rhymesayers and Definitive Jux is becoming just as influential as old-school hip-hop (late 80s). Don't give up on the genre, just give up on the mainstream aspect of it.that stands strongly next to those talents.

B000002J09|5.0|For the new Zeppelin fan, Led Zeppelin IV is maybe the best place to start.  Picking a favorite Zeppelin album is like deciding which of your kids you like best, but with such instantly recognizable tunes as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\", Led Zeppelin IV is a good introduction to a great classic rock act.  There is not a bad song on this album.  If this is the first Zeppelin album to go in your collection, you'll be adding more soon afterwards<br /><br />The only thing that makes the compact disc edition a little awkward is the continuity.  The vinyl and cassette editions flipped side after \\"Stairway\\" and it was like starting new.  Now the continuity goes uninterupted from \\"Stairway\\" to \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\".  It's a little different, but it's a small price to pay for the convienience of the compact disc.
0399242864|3.0|The colors and illustration in this book are fantastic. The story is pretty slim, however. It's probably a good book for those who want a book to read to small children, but it's not one I'd expect kids to pour over in their own early reading, which is what I was looking for. Though the illustrations were truly lovely, a weak story led me to return this.
B00005YJMX|4.0|This is a film that takes a few viewings to fully appreciate Herzog's attempt at recreating a movie in the style of the German Expressionist film movement of the early 20th Century.  Although very well done, it doesn't quite compare with the creepiness of the Murnau original.  However, this is still a fantastic film and the commentary by Herzog is very insightful for the student of the horror film classics.

B0000025P9|5.0|DUDE--Mr. S. St Thomas \\"suckerfly\\" --you NAILED it better than I could have myself...excellent job! <br /> <br />Most people are just stupid and that's that.  They will listen to the hugely commercial feel of Michael Jackson's Thriller and miss the fact that basically it was TOTO playing those tunes--in fact, Steve Porcaro even wrote one of the ballads if I'm not mistaken.   <br /> <br />TOTO is like the BeeGees--that is, for some reason, maybe popularity or the curse of grammy success, people turned on them, so they just wrote huge hits for other artists. Like Mr. S. St Thomas \\"suckerfly\\" said, if it was a Steely Dan hit, it was cool, but if it's TOTO???  Stupid. <br /> <br />This by FAR, was the most diverse pop band EVER.  That's right, ever.  No other group had the skill of writing songs and the musicianship to play--yes, they actually played on their own records--at TOTO's level. <br /> <br />I saw TOTO last year (2004) and they KILLED with Simon Phillips on drums.  Steve Lukather was ON FIRE.  Bobby Kimball sounded like it was 1984 again.  His leaving TOTO after the epic IV'th LP was a disaster for everyone.  They tried to go too far left with Isolation and lost their fan base, those looking for more of the TOTO IV sound. <br /> <br />Lastly, TOTO I is another classic and Hydra is excellent as well.  If their was a departure, it was Turn Back and maybe Isolation.  Turn Back sounds more like a demo compared to IV.  <br />Probelm is, most have never really listened to all their work.  it is an amazing catalog of music.  Compare TOTO IV to Kingdom of Desire and your head will twist around--Is this the same band?  They changed singers so much they lost their core audience, but it also made them sound so diverse.  Life in the music biz.  They are still HUGE in Europe and Asia.  Go figure. <br /> <br />...and Jeff's hat work on Waiting For Your Love is AMAZING!  Silky smooth dynamics.
B00064WSNW|5.0|Insane wackos disconcert me when they are raging through the spirals of misunderstanding; their phasmagorical cinisisms lead me to believe they have something to gain. But, this is amazon and let the wild misuse, dissalude, and track weary old footprints in snowy screens. @%#$ on all of you and your  reviews too.    It's the weary old argument I have held with my prog-liking friend for the past years: Why do you listen to prog(progressive rock musaaaac!)? He just keeps to himself because he's an obsessive percussionist who worships those who rule his instrument, when I ask him that very question. Yet I probe and probe; where,  why, and how can you listen to what sounds like if Beethoven were to drop his notebook, and all the notes fell out of the pages, and he had tried to cover it up by mashing them all together just before deadline? He never answered my question.    Never mind my skepticism and Mr. 500th reviewer, who's too pigheaded for his own girth-he simply does not get it. Although, that is not say that people like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai ought to be allowed not to be cut in the street-at the beheast of Lord \\"Five-Hundreth Reviewer\\" and myself. I am just saying that he  is obviously a newcomer to music. Borneing upon the same Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin records all your life will only open your mind to your greatest, most greediest opinion: Insert Opinion here.     I, though, see it as international music, like Paul Simon's backing band with its unnaturally white percuss-oh, they're African! I get it now. If you put these guys from King Crimson, at this period 1981, you would find that they are the best dang acting band in Spain or Rio or France(shiver). It's simply a different mindset then we are used to, like where we are obsessed with sixties music still, other places have never felt that exact warmth, so they still like organic music, which is THIS King Crimson all the way.    This music is similar with other light-prog bands. There is another side,of course, which concerns themselves with any European prophet other than Beethoven, on which most music is based in the twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Dream Theatre and all of its sister bands and side projects is one other side of  prog-rock created by the great grandfather: Frank Zappa, and the Greatest Grandfathers: Classical Composers from Bach all the way to Copeland. All of it is the same organic, organized, altruistic-to the Creator-like stuff that has brached off in a tree since those same mind opening sixties. And, although this type of music is akin to intelligence in music, it does not appeal to those looking for emotional strength within lyrics and voice. Why? Because they all use guitars as their main appeal, and the guitar is by all accounts a stepchild instrument that cannot communicate very easily as do violin and woodwinds which closely reflect humanity distorted by metal.     The one mercurial cache is, of course, Jimi Hendrix. He was the only one to really bring everything together, and no one has done it since. Was it mojo? Was it Voodoo Chile? Nary a knower in the world, but most would say that his soul was speaking through that guitar, and the legend lives on. Prog Rock hides from this Human element like a plague, and anyone can tell you that Music as a whole has been on a sharp declavity since 2000, in all its lugubrious drollery.    Now, as far as this King Crimson album goes, it is a taint upon the entire community of musicians prog and other, except for those wonderful, few moments where it is pretty enjoyable. However, you would be better off with In The Court Of The Crimson King, which is one of those invariable experiments gone right. You will not, however, find the face of Hendrix quite on it, but their siamese dream of reaching enlightenment in the late sixties only nearly fails. The last track actually sounds like rapture, it is awsome!    Discipline is really not a very King Crimson-like album, it sounds like they're takinga bite out of something they cannot handle-at first. This may be the absolutely greatest trait of King Crimson, that they can actually absorb themselves into their contemporaries' musical veins and treat prog rock to the great  taste, and wonder. For instance on this they take from New Wave and most noticably the Talking Head's lead singer. That is the bane of Prog rock's existence, to bend itself like plasma or jelly with outside influences and turn it into a complicated symphony that has been made anew with inspiration. Remain In Light  was a thunderous Eno & Heads event that just kind of tipped the hat of its genius into everybody's caps-and it's the direct parent to this album, obviously. Mediocre, you might say, when comparing the two, but it matters not. For it has thus from then on transpired to work on future minds of Progressive Rock with  the continuing chain. It all depends on how you think...    I would not know how this remastering sounds compared to other recordings, except for the fact that they have given center stage to the singing, and that the guitar has been placed in the backround like it were shameful to play. It sounds like air, if air had no depth and we all didn't know how to breathe. Like Megadeth remasterings.  Note: the 5ooth reviewer character refers to dumb reviewers in general, the ignorant man that runs 'round rampant.    The Talking Heads are awsome also: Fear of Music, Remain In Light, Speaking In Tongues, and Stop Making Sense.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|When will Sony release other MJ concerts like the Bad or HIStory tours. If you got the Ultimate collection, you would already have owned this DVD. Besides the rerelease of this DVD all in all it was pretty good. I especially enjoyed the Smooth Criminal performance. I recommend it to any type of fans of MJ beginner to hardcore fan.
6305949980|5.0|I'm sure the majority that have seen this film probably agree with me that this is a classic. And why wouldn't be? It is a Tim Burton production and practically every film he touches turns into gold. As the case with this one. A Christmas like you've never seen. A Christmas with a little twist of halloween. Jack and Sally's characters in this film make the film extremely memorable with excellent portrayals. Who wouldn't like to see the Boogie Man take on Santa Claus? And the music, none the cheesy as it tends to go with some Disney flicks. This tale is  beautiful and original. Including the music, created and sung by none other than Danny Elfman. They even named a band after Jack Skellington. Heck even Blink 182 mentions Jack and Sally in \\"I miss you.\\" If you are looking for a plot, don't dismay this has one as well and a central theme. So no one should feel left out, even those who enjoy artistic features.

0790729628|4.0|This film is one that had a deep impact on me - the set decoration alone is well worth muliple viewings. The dark mood and sad, evocative sountrack by Vangelis add greatly to the experience of one writers bleak outlook on Los Angeles in the second decade of the 21st century. <br />  <br />For those of us who watched the original 'non-Director's cut' many times, the lack of narration at first leaves an empty feeling that is soon assauged by the visuals - this IS a movie afterall - and one can particiapate in the story more intimatley.
0060763280|5.0|If you only read one book this year, it should be this one. Harv teaches you to totally rethink all your attitudes about money and wealth. He teaches you how your current attitudes were shaped by your parents and your experiences in the past. He goes on to teach you how to change those attitudes. <br />I will reread this book often and learn something new in the process with each reading. It is not only educational but fun to read, also.
B00005JNSK|4.0|I really didn't want to see this movie but my kids begged to go. So, I took them and I am SO GLAD I did. I LOVED this movie as much as I did the first one. Johnny Depp did a wonderful job as Willie Wonka. This movie is a MUST SEE for ALL ages. Watch it and enjoy!!
B0009RCPY8|4.0|The outside box does say that GB is in fullscreen and GB2 is in widescreen.  However, that is a misprint.  Originally they did intend to release it this way, but the backlash was so severe that they reversed this (stupid) decision.  I guess the box artwork was already printed by this point.  Rest assured that the actual movies are BOTH in widescreen and there is not even a fullscreen option.  The inside boxes do both indicate widescreen.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This was a great album. I don't buy a lot of hip hop, but this was certainly a great purchase. It's full of clever lines, great songs and excellent beats. A host of celebrities including Jamie Foxx and Jay-Z make appearances on this album. Everything was definitely above par, however, there are a handful of skits that take a cynical view on attending college and they don't really do anything more than break up the rhythem of the album, could have definitely done without those.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Author Frank Miller and director Robert Rodriguez bring to the big screen one of the most explicit, violent and character-driven graphic novels of recent years.  Based on solid performances by a bunch of hot-shot actors (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, among others), and with author Frank Miller giving the proper assistance to Rodriguez, \\"Sin City\\" is a masterpiece of noir atmosphere, since the very first scene to the apocalyptic and self-destructing ending.<br /><br />Violence fills every scene. The monochromatic, grayish shots are almost claustrophobic, and the violence depicted is so effective that you expect a splat of blood or a loose bullet to strike you in the audience.<br /><br />There are three \\"Sin City\\" stories in this movie, that somewhat come togheter at the end. The first one is about Jim Hartigan (Bruce Willis) an aging, close-to-retirement cop that investigates a series of rape-murder-kills, only to discover that the murderer is a very influent person. The second story features an almost irrecognizeable Mickey Rourke - the best actor in the movie -, a sort of unstoppable super-hero-like character, trying to avenge the murder of the only woman that gave herself up to him without charging anything. And the third story is about how Dwight and Johnny-Boy have a curious meeting that may break up the ballance between the hookers, the Mob and the Police in Basin City dark alleys.<br /><br />The direction, the final computer art and the casting is so good that I almost expected to see the text baloons coming out of the character's mouths in the screen. Great effort, great result.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10
0060765798|5.0|I downloaded this book from Audible. My sons and I listened to it in the car and finished the whole thing in one day. When we went on errands, they even asked if they could stay in the car and listen while I did what I had to do.<br /><br />We loved it!! It was silly, educational, and entertaining all at once, with suspense thrown in. The boys' favorite character is Sunny, while I rather like Violet.<br /><br />Especially engaging was the multicast recording.  We have since missed this in the subsequent Lemony Snicket audiobooks.<br /><br />I want to warn those who have seen the SOUE film:  Expect something different in the books.  The film combined three books, and not very well.  The books have much more substance.
0375805613|5.0|My 3 year-old stepson loves bedtime stories and I wanted to get him some new books.  \\"The Monster at the End of This Book\\" was one of my favorite books when I was little and I knew Amazon.com would carry it.  He giggles every time we read it and it brings back such happy memories for me.  \\"Lovable, furry old Grover\\" is a classic and I hope many little kids get to know him through this wonderful book.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Having been a teenager in the 70s and grown up on Yes,The Who,Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull etc. and their own versions of the concept album I was really quite surprised when I heard this CD on my son's player. It almost sounds like they were listening to Quadrophenia drinking a few beers and said hey we can do that and they did.  I have never listened to any of their stuff before but this is an impressive CD.  I like the varied styles and musicianship and I really think it could stand up to the classic rock music of the 70s but with a modern touch.
B00000F169|1.0|Amazon offers many good movies.<br /><br />Dark Star is not one of them.<br /><br />Don't buy it.<br /><br />It really is that bad.
B0007OASII|5.0|The Black Halo is just great as Karma or Epica. Khan has an amazing voice and Thomas Youngblood is the riff king. Some of my friends seem to like this one the best out of the Kamelot catalog. Tastes may vary on which album is the best, but they are all sweet in different ways.
0156027321|5.0|This book took me a while to read because I had a lot going on, and the beginning is also a little slow to get going.<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed the book. Around the middle it became incredibly compelling and I couldn't put it down. I am glad I stuck with it!<br /><br />The book is engaging and just spiritual enough to appeal to those who are into inspiring books, but not so religious as to turn off non-believers.  It definitely doesn't follow a prescribed plot and is definitely out-of-the-ordinary.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
1589269063|5.0|This book was a quick and easy read.  It offered logical principles that can be applied to any relationship (not just marriage).  Great book.
B0002858YS|4.0|If you are a fan of early Cure music, you will most probably enjoy this cd.  The songs are catchy, but not trite.  Admittedly, some lines are a bit hoaky (\\"I got soul, but I'm not a soldier...\\") but they do not detract from the disc.  If you're looking for music that has a really powerful message, search elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for a new band that has strong ties to 80's alternative music but which does not merely copy that era's style, the Killers certainly serve up a worthy disc of music.
B000005DQR|5.0|If you don't know about Solesides, aka Quannum, this is the cat that started it all, the backbone of the crew, DJ Shadow.  Also influenced countless producers with his \\"sample anything\\" philosophy.  This album sets the precedent for many of the DJ instrumental \\"mixtapes\\" that have come out in recent years, (RJD2 comes to mind) and it doesn't disappoint.  If you were expecting a hip-hop album, it ain't, but something very refreshing.  Picture your dad's record collection and then imagine if someone went in there, chopped it all up, then came out with a coherent album with all different sounds that still flowed into one another.  This is that album, and although it came out about 10 years ago, it still sounds fresh, so take a chance and listen to something different.
0688170528|5.0|This book is amazing. I can't say enough good things about it. I liked the ending of this one better than the end of My Sister's Keeper, though I am sure there are those who would disagree with me on that point.<br /><br />The Pact is about Chris and Emily, teenaged lovers who started out as best friends as children and have known each other their entire lives. One night Chris is found bleeding from a head wound next to Emily, who is dying of a gunshot wound to the head. Chris tells a story of a suicide pact that he was unable to follow through on, but a detective immediately has doubts. Their two families, bound by their children and their friendships, are blown apart as the accusations begin to fly about Chris's involvement in Emily's death. This book is equal parts love story, family drama, and courtroom drama. Needless to say I highly recommend it!
B0000DZTIW|4.0|I may be wrong, but my feeling is that 'The Last Samurai' was made in response to the adulation poured on 'Crouching Tiger...' by the western world. As such, it's almost inevitable that the movie, and Zimmer's soundtrack, have to be compared against the follow-up epics produced in the East -- namely 'Hero' and 'Flying Daggers'.<br /><br />As a film, 'The Last Samurai' is flawed, largely because it was in part yet another blockbuster vehicle for Tom Cruise. But I have to admit, as a soundtrack, it works very well, to this western ear anyway. Play this loud -- forget Tom Cruise -- remember the movie, if you wish -- make up your own story, if you haven't seen it. This is wonderfully dramatic music -- partly orchestral, partly synthesised. Zimmer has been sensible and not tried to compose cod-Oriental music. I even detected shades of Arvo Part's Tabula Rasa in some of the strings.<br /><br />Frankly much of this would have sat comfortably in any of the 'Lord of the Rings' films. It is glorious stuff, highly recommended. (And I'd recommend the Hero and Flying Daggers CDs too.)
0060254920|5.0|This is a great book!  My husband & I both read it when we were kids & are excited about sharing it with our kids.
B00000099Y|5.0|First off I want to tell some people that if you are a hardcore Christian fanatic this album aint for you,but for the rest of us this is an album that put tool on the map.This album starts of with Stinkfist,a great and fastest song here.(use your imagination on what the songs about)Next is Eulogy a song that shows Maynard's dissatisfaction with people dying for us so we can blame ourselves for their demise.H is third and a song that goes from light to jeavy in its minute span.46 andTwo is next, one of their best known song and a favorite of mine. Hooker with a penis is a song that tells critics that they did not sell out.Jimmy is a song that he wrote for his son on how he keeps him grounded to the earth.And Aenima, a no holds barred song about peoples deadly sin of pride in Los Angeles and how people are so stuck up with themselves.This album will display this bands great instrumental skill along with some of the best vocals in rock by Maynard James keenan.This is probably their best album that will sound as great as the day you bought it, but for some people it will take time to grow on you.
0743454537|5.0|This book was a very quick read for me, not because it's short but because it's so incredibly engrossing that I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is the story of Katie, a teenager who has suffered from leukemia since she was a toddler, but more importantly it's about her younger sister Anna, who was conceived specifically for the purpose of providing cord blood, and later bone marrow and platelets for her sister. You see, Anna was genetically engineered to be a perfect match for her sister.<br /><br />I don't want to give very much away, so I'll just mention the other characters: Brian (a firefighter), Sara (a former lawyer, now stay at home mom), Jesse (the girls' brother); and Campbell and Julia, two strangers who become intricately involved in the family's lives.<br /><br />I was able to relate to this book on many levels given the medical ups and downs my family has also gone through, but I was troubled by the central question: Is a person who is a perfect match obligated to help care for a sibling who needs her help to survive?<br /><br />This is a terrific book. I greatly look forward to reading more of Picoult's books.
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is one of my favorite business books - the concepts from this book have stuck with me in the years since I have read it, and I put them to practice when I have a big decision that needs to be made at work.      Collins has an uncanny way of providing solid and meaningful business insight in a way that is neither dry nor overly goofy, as so many business books available today do.  He presents the information in a format that is both easy and enjoyable to read.  Yet it is not fluffy - the concepts are fundamental and applicable in day-to-day work.    One of the things I appreciate most about this book is that the claims are made not based on the biases or opinions of the author, but on facts.  He hasn't simply researched companies that were successful on the surface, but that met very specific criteria for inclusion.  He followed a very regimented approach to evaluating what made them different.      This book is well worth the investment.
0671449028|5.0|I love to give board books for gifts - especially this one.  The drawings are so colorful - and the text is something that children and adults alike will enjoy time after time after time after...well you get the point.

Katherine Dewey's books always lead you through the process without intimidating the would be sculptor using the new clays. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to try the new clays.
0739309013|5.0|This book took me at least a month of commute listening to finish.  However, it was worth the time!<br /><br />I guess I was expecting the basic John Grisham legal thriller, but that's not what this book is. It's more of a tale of crime and life in a small town in Mississippi, with wonderfully quirky characters that we have come to expect from Grisham.  Despite the book not being what I expected, I came away from it being quite satisfied.<br /><br />I recommend it -- just be sure you know going into it that you're not reading something along the lines of The Firm or The Testament or the other legal thriller books by Grisham.
B000002UDB|5.0|They just got better and better each time. The beatles, Magical Mystery Tour was my favorite of their albums. Not only did it have a strange theme but it shifted the band to the pshychadelic era of rock n roll. Favorites of mine on the album were  Strawberry Fields Forever Penny Lane and I am the Walrus(corteous of the great John Lennon). I feel not much is needed to say,a  must add to your beatles collections.
0743454537|3.0|I devoured this story! So contemporary in its main issue! So interesting, to read the variety of points of view (though Kate's side would have been interesting--does SHE really want her sister to risk the organ donation or not?). So disappointing, the way Picoult let me down with her conclusion! I was eager to find out which way the story would go, but to let me down in the end like this story does is a true disappointment. It makes me hesitate to pick up another of Picoult's books, wary of a similar \\"easy-way-out\\" ending.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I saw this movie as a teenager, and have bought it now for my kids! I was glad to find it and be able to show them this excelent story of good, evil, and the necessary balance between them that avoids absolutes.

B0009I7O7A|5.0|Well, if you love John Mayer (which you either do or don't) then you will like this dual-disc.  I have the original Room For Squares but bought this as my obsession with the handsome young man has been growing.  Honestly, the DVD was why I got it.  It is a good little synoptic look into the pre-\\"world\\"famous John.  It shows how regular the guy is and that he plays music out of sheer delight, pleasure and talent.  That is why I seem to love him so much.  As for the CD, well it is the CD.  So if you love John you will enjoy the vingette (which seems to be alot of home video stuff so you get a glimpse of the real man... breakdancing, water-guzzling, laundry and all! As for the previous reviewer who is obviously pissed off about the whole dual-disc thing....just don't buy anymore and try to blame it on John.
B000068PQ7|4.0|\\"White Light\\" is often called Gene Clark's masterpiece, but I disagree. It does have several excellent songs, such as \\"For a Spanish Guitar\\" and \\"With Tomorrow,\\" but several of the songs sound too similar to leave a lasting impression. Some songs need a fuller sound to flesh them out.  <br /> <br />Also on the song \\"White Light,\\" the lyrics are rather obtuse and hard to understand. Sometimes if you've got a great piece of music this can be overlooked, but the sparse sound of these tracks call attention to the lyrics. It's a strong album, but it's not as good as \\"Roadmaster\\" or \\"No Other.\\" <br /> <br />As other reviewers noted,the disc reminds one of Dylan's mid-60's period, but that's not a bad thing, at least to me. I rate it four stars on the strength of \\"For a Spanish Guitar\\" alone . It ranks of one of Gene Clark's best songs ever, and \\"With Tomorrow\\" and \\"Because of You\\" aren't too far behind.
B000002OX7|5.0|The best Who rock album ever recorded.  My second favorite is Who Are You followed by Quadrophenia.  Every track is filled with the power and glory of Pete's superb guitar playing, Keiths frantic drumming, John's pounding bass and Rogers rock god vocals.  This should be in the collection of every rock and roll fan, even casual fans of The Who will love this one.
B000005ALP|5.0|I'm not much for modern music. I like classic rock/pop much better. I got in to this CD through the movie Shrek, and the song 'My Beloved Monster\\". Then I checked out the CD, and slowly, it grew on me.<br /><br />  This CD is really a one-time jem. That's not to say that the other Eels albums aren't good, it's just that this one is so much better. It's done perfectly. The songs are tender, and the lead singer, E, puts a lot of feel into them. But, the songs feel somehow wrong. This isn't a problem, it's intentional. The songs are, in general, love songs, but sing them to your girlfriend and you won't have a girlfriend to sing to much longer. There's something lurking in them below the tender surface, like a crazy boyfriend in a stalker movie.<br /><br />  Anyways, buy this CD.
0895260131|1.0|The author of this book uses very questionable sources. Most of the  events he uses to describe what the Prophet Muhammad supposedly did  come from Ibn Ishaq's biography on the Prophet. First off, the author is not necessarily quoting from Ibn Ishaq, but from a translator of his work, Guillaume. Guillaume has been criticized for not translating the work honestly, since he apparently inserts acts of the prophet that come from the biography by Tabari (which is known to be a very weak source). In addition, Ibn Ishaq himself admits in his work that it should be taken with a grain of salt, since he does not verify the source of what he heard concerning the actions of the Prophet. In fact, sometimes there will be two stories in his work that contradict each other, and Ibn Ishaq leaves it up to future scholars to verify which is true.<br /><br />Secondly, if you use common sense after studying the life of Prophet Muhammad (from actual Islamic sources), you'll notice clearly there is a contradiction. According to Islamic biographies on Muhammad, he was an extremely compassionate person who cared for the poor, fought against the unjust acts of the time, promoted women's rights, and spoke against persecuting non-Muslims (he himself says in a hadith that on the Day of Judgment, he will be against a Muslim who persecutes or overburdens a non-Muslim). Now, according to this book, Muhammad was an evil dictator who was hell bent on killing all those who opposed him without showing any mercy. Both cannot be true. One of them is lying. In order to recognize which  one is the truth, we have to turn to a more relaible source- the Quran. Judging from the Quran, which all Muslims and serious non-Muslim scholars do not dispute in terms of its authenticity as coming from the Prophet, it would be obvious that the former case is true. The Quran makes it absolutely clear that justice -even more so than peace- is important and that non-Muslims who do not threaten Muslims are to be protected.<br /><br />In any case, I would not take this book seriously. Throughout the book, the author completely ignores the historical context, and only makes mention of it when it suites his claims. The author even tries to dispute the Golden Age of Muslims- even though serious historians and scholars of Islam (like Bernard Lewis, who is no pro-Islam), recognize it. It would take a whole book to scrutinize each and every single thing this author wrote, so I'll  leave it at that. Not recommended whatsoever.ny case, I would not take this book seriously.

B00001OH7V|4.0|Heros is oftern held as one of David Bowies all time best albums, but to me thats just not true, he had many more better albums. While most of the songs here are great some of the album just drags on. Of the albums in 'The Berlin Triligy,' (Low, Heros, and Lodger), this is easly the weakest of the three. Boasting semi-hard rock with electronica worked well on the other two albums amazingly but just not as well on Heros. I bought this album beleaving the hype and putting the album on I still to this day am dissapointed about it. while some of the album drags on it is still a good album and the musicianship is good if you have the patiants to listen. David Bowies lyrics and Saxaphone playing are amazing as well as the guitar playing on the album, especially Robert Fripp on the opening track. The soundscapes are wonderfull as well, it's just put together as a whole its missing something.<br /><br />The album opens up with the space-aged 'Beauty And The Beast' which features fantastic guitar by Robery Fripp and is a pretty cool track but it also gets kind of old after a few listens. But is a good song to open the album with. 'Joe The Lion' isvery 1980's and very David Bowie, even though this album came out before the 80's. This is one of the better songs on the album. The title track 'Heros' is one of David Bowie's all time best songs and is full of amazingly beautiful lyrics. Truly a classic among classics. I like 'Sons Of The Silent Age' it's a slower almost ballader and Bowie's voice sounds amazing on it. 'Blackout' is one of the better songs on the album, with great guitar and a upbeat almost disco since of flavor to it, it really rocks. 'V-2 Schneider' is one of my favorite instrumentals ever, and is easily Bowies best of his carear. 'Since Of Doubt' is a slower song and is one of the songs that I think drag the album on and could have benifited from having left off. But I will say this, there is some impressive piano work on that song. 'Moss Garden' is a beautiful song, with some Japanese influence and it sounds really nice, one of my favorites on the album. 'Neuk&ouml;ln' is another song that drags on just a little to long and I think that is why they dont let you listen to it cause it is too boring, probably not. 'Secret Life Of Arabia' was the absolute best choice to end the album, after the previous slower tracks it cans speed again leaving you wanting more, more of which you get on the next album, Lodger!<br /><br />While this isnt David bowies best album it still is a pretty good one, I mean I still gave it four stars. No other album features David Bowie singing with such desperation, you can tell he was fighting some inner demons with this one whe he was recording it. This album, even though it's not his best, I would still highly recomend picking it up!ul song, with some Japanese influence and it sounds really nice, one of my favorites on the album.

1573223026|5.0|Another brilliant novel by an amazingly talented writer. In this truly delightful novel Hornby has created 4 completely different characters, given them all their own unique voice and makes the reader care about each of them as if they were an old friend until the very last page. I had a great time reading this book. A perfect companion to \\"About a Boy\\" and \\"High Fidelity\\", and like those two this will also make a great movie. As I read the book I saw Hugh Grant as Martin, Brenda Blethyn as Maureen, Keira Knightly as Jess, and Brendan Fraser as J.J. How's that for a dream cast? Highly recommend!
0060528737|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best I have ever read. It's right up there with Philip Pullman's Dark Materials Trilogy and Harry Potter. The only thing dissapointing about this book is that it is the end of the series. <br /> <br />The book picks right back up where Lirael left off. I recommend reading the series in order starting with Sabriel and then Lirael to fully enjoy it. So Lirael, having finally discovered her true destiny after a life time of longing for what she can never have, has set out with her companions Prince Sameth, Mogget, and the Disreputable dog. They are forced to comfront the greatest challenge hoisted on anyone since the very beginning. <br /> <br />You know what, I'm terrible at writing summaries and if I keep telling you about the book, why would you want to read it? <br />All I can say is that this book is excellent and passing it by would be a big mistake, as I myself came close to doing.  <br />Anyone could enjoy this series regardless of what type of book he or she normally reads. This series deserves the wild popularity that the Harry Potter books have attained because they are just as good. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the entire trilogy.
0780619951|4.0|The Island of Dr. Moreau is a great film.  Dare I say it, a piece of underrated mastery.  Yes.  There I said it.   <br /> <br />Let us begin with the genius qualities this film has within it: a brilliant turn by Val Kilmer (one of his best performances) <br />a decent stretch by Marlon Brando  <br />dazzling special effects by Stan Winston <br />haunting score, one that resembles the original score for \\"Alien\\" <br /> <br />This film is often nightmarish and gripping.  It delivers very very frightening moments, both in and out of reality.  The genius of the late great John Frankenheimer truly runs through the spine of this film.  Even the title sequence is reminiscent of Frankenheimer's abstract \\"Seconds\\" title sequence. <br /> <br />Here's what could get me bludgeoned by reviewers: It has a sociopolitical commentary worth sharing.  A scary comment on human beings and their capacity for feverish violence and rage.  Add that with its wondrous compositions (the film is incredibly shot -it is Frankenheimer, folks) poses a notion about what truly separates us from the animals, is it our ability to reason which we often neglect or is it simply nothing?   <br /> <br />One of the most underrated, stylish gems of the 90s.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Bob Dylan's classic album Highway 61 Revisited is one of the all time greatest albums ever recorded. From song to song Dylans lyrical genius shines through brighter and brighter as teh album goes forth. 1965 marked a turning point in bob Dylans carear, he would no longer be known as a musician making powerful political music on single songs but rather a musican making powerful political music on whole albums, and Highway 61 Revisited can be souly thanked for this, marking a new chapter in the Bob Dylan soga.<br /><br />Long Harald as one of Dylans best albums and his best to some the album opens with Dylans all time best song as well as one of the all time best songs period, 'Like A Rollin' Stone' much like this album marked a turning point in Dylans carear this song marked a turning point in radio, no longer did songs have to be 2:30 in length. This was the first song ever played on radio over three minutes long. 'Tombstone Blues' is a Bob Dylan classic thats obviously a blues song, and also boasts some pretty good guitar played buy the guy from THE BAND. 'It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry' apart from having one of the coolest song titles of all time is one of the very best songs Bob Dylan ever wrote and recorded, its just such a cool song. Great lyrics, nice backing music and great slide guitar set this song apart from the rest of the album. 'From A Buick 6' is a harder rocker compared to the rest of the album and is done very well, with Bob Dylans vocals actually complamenting the songs texture. The next song is one of my all time favorites and is a Bob Dylan classic and should be harold as one of the all time best songs but often gets over looked. 'Ballad Of A Thin Man' is easily the best song on the album, despite critics and other nay-sayers, saying that 'Like A Rolling Stones' is better cause it's not! 'Queen Jane Approximatley' is a slower ballad that could have been a hit single for Dylan had it been released way back when this album was released. It features that signature organ that Dylan made famous in the mid to late 1960's. The title track, 'Highway 61 Revisited' is yet another Bob Dylan Classic and was covered by Johnny Winter in 1970, and is is one of the few Bob Dylan songs that are better not covered, even though Winter did do some really nice slide guitar work on the song. 'Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues' is a nice little ballad by Dylan that helped Keith Richards write You got The Silver on Let It Bleed. It's a nice song with great lyrics like ever other song Bob ever wrote but to me it's  nothing way to special. 'Desolation Row' apart from having a killer title is yet another Bob Dylan classic. The is perfect for closing the album, it features some of Bob Dylans all time best lyrics and certainly some of his most heart felt and sencer, and it's just Bob and his acoustic guitar and harmonica. The Dylan of old if you will.<br /><br />Highway 61 Revisited is one of those few rare albums and moments in rock and roll and music history that no one should miss out on, so do your self a really really big favor and pick up this awesome album.eleased.

B000002U82|5.0|This is a rock masterpiece. One of Pink Floyd's best album IMO. This is the album where Roger Water's songwriting skills take control of what was and forever be Pink Floyd. Waters's bass pumps through most of the tracks. Favorites include Speak To Me/Breathe, Time, Money, Us And Them, Brain Damage, and Eclipse. A album for any classic rock fan. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|If you loved their other albums you will love this one compilation of their best music i loved it this is a must buy with all your favourites together on one disc amazing!!!!!
B00097A5I6|2.0|The CD sounds like it was recorded in 2 days instead of the months and months it's said to have taken. From the song touting laziness, I can only assume that Oasis have lost their enthusiasm and fire. <br /> <br />Previous albums like What's the story, morning glory, Be here now and to a certain extent Standing on the shoulder of giants are such a treat to listen to since it's over-produced and over-arranged by Noel. While Def. maybe isn't over-produced, Noel certainly arranged most of the songs with numerous guitar solos with numerous variations among them. <br /> <br />However, this CD sounds like it was rushed. Half the album sounds like it was a demo take or a bare-bones take before further arrangments could be added but they never bothered with it. The latter half of this album with all the mid-tempo sounds like 1 big song and really fails to hold attention. Where are the solo flourshes from Def. Maybe, or the orchestral instruments from WTSMG and the long eletified wall of melodic guitar wave of Be here now or the touch of electronica of SOTSOG? <br /> <br />On the plus side, it's nice that they fired the keyboard player who recorded with Oasis on the last album; Heathern Chemistry. The multiple layers  of annoying keyboard muck is gone that sounded like the keyboard player was paid per note recorded. There are no godawful songs like 1/3 of Standing on the shoulder of giants is. But, this CD just sounds like a demo CD and not a real CD.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is my favorite Rolling Stones album. It has two of my favorite Stones songs on it, Gimmie Shelter and You Can't Always Get What You Want. These two songs is one of the many reasons to buy this cd. Also the production is good. Plus Mick Taylor's debut. Other favorites include Love in Vain, Country Honk, Midnight Rambler, You Got the Silver, and Monkey Man. Highly recommended
B00092ZL80|5.0|its out of this World Combination. <br />I have been a Chicago Fan since the early seventies. <br />25 6 to 4 is my favourite Chicago song which was the encore song <br /> <br />Philip Bailey singing is also the best in the business singing <br />songs like Fantasy,lets groove tonight etc. <br /> <br />Both bands have their own horn sections,and what a BLAST hearing  <br />them  combine.To sum it up both bands have ballads,soul,funk & rock sound in their system. I have all the DVD by Chicago with new singer Jason Jeff.However I would love to have the early days <br />of Chicago on DVD with Peter Cetera on it. <br />We have seen many bands come and go,especially the PUNK Rockers <br />and Rap music.which I think thet are all rubbish Bands <br /> <br />With Chicago & EWF,all their songs have melody and good lyrics <br />to it. <br />The show start with the two groups combining and later on  their own.EWF sang all their hits which includes claasic like Fantasy <br />After the love is gone,lets groove.Chicago with Hard to say i am <br />sorry,Saturday in the Park,If you leave me now. <br /> <br />Calling all true blue Chicago/EWF Fans this is the DVD you must <br />buy without hesitation.I hope other Bands will also follow their <br /> <br />footstep.What about Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin combine with Robert Plant singing Highway Star or Ian Gillan singing Stairway to Heaven ??? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0345457684|3.0|I have to say, this is an alright story, with alright writing, and a pretty good idea. I just dont think im in to this sorta thing. it was too long to keep my interest. it was really only interesting in the fight scenes.
B000002C1W|5.0|This is a good cd by Pink Floyd. Exit Roger Waters. Enter David Gilmour. Taking control of Pink Floyd their is one major change. More guitar. Some of the best guitar work is found on this album. Favorites include Learning To Fly, The Dogs Of War, On The Turning Away, Terminal Frost, and  Sorrow. Highly Recommended.

0930289528|5.0|.............This was great. V is very enigmatic, and all the characters are memorable. The story actually has a great message. I read this a long time ago, and i want to make sure more and more people read this before the movie comes out. I think the movie will be great. I love the watchowskies, but everybody should read this before seeing that. i heard they were changing the story up a bit.
B000001FTJ|5.0|Tom Waits first album of his trilogy is a classic. Its so strange that you will have to listen to it a few times to get the meaning of the record. Some people hate his voice. I love it. He is probably the most unrecognized songwriters of his time. This record also has some great music on it. Favorites include 16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought Six, Town With No Cheer, Swordfishtrombone,Soldier's Things, and Gin Soaked Boy. The instrumentals and other songs are also good. Highly recommended.
0671027387|5.0|Like each Dan Brown book that I've read, I simply could not put this book down. There are great twists and it follows a similar pattern to Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code.  However, this one concentrates on U.S. politics and bureacracy. Also, the plot involving NASA goes along with some events currently in the news.<br /><br />If you want a fast summer read, Deception Point is a great pick!
B000002WPI|5.0|This is the best of the best. This album has everything. Lyrics, beats, and different styles. All nine members are great lyricists(even ODB). The beats by RZA are rich and dark. Favorites are Bring da Ruckus, Shame on a N****, Clan in da Front, Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber, Can It Be All So Simple, Mystery of Chessboxin', Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F' Wit, C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Protect Ya Neck, and Tearz. Thats basically the whole cd. That's how good it is. If you dont have this, then your collection is uncomplete. RIP ODB!!!
B00005JM1F|5.0|Office Space used to be my favorite comedy but Old School completely destroyed it! It was absolutely hilarious! Just check out the hilarious cast! Luke Wilson! Vince Vaughn! Will Ferrell! Need I say more? But, this is Will Ferrell's movie! He is absolutely hilarious and delivers nonstop laughs every second that he's on screen! <br />We're Going Streaking!!!!!!!! <br />And for those of you saying that this isn't funny, come on! How isn't this funny? What about Will Ferrell naked? The trainquilizer? What about \\"Now drop and give me 10!!\\"?  <br />What about when Will Ferrell gives a 6 year old child a toaster for his birthday? That Luke Wilson had given Ferrell for his wedding present!!!!!!!!! Hilarious! How isn't that funny??? Do you people have a sense of humor? Come on! <br />Oh and for those of you people saying that it's predictable.. NO DUH!!!!! All comedies are predictable! It doesn't matter if they are! They aren't supposed to be unpredictable or have good and original plots!! They're supposed to be funny!!!!! And that's what it was!!!! Hilarious!!! It was supposed to be funny!!!! It was FUNNY!!!! Who cares if it wasn't serious? It wasn't supposed to be! <br />I don't even need to talk about the plot because it doesn't matter! This movie blows away all other comedies!!!!!!!! Including Office Space! This is THE GODFATHER OF COMEDIES AND SHALL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER!! You'll laugh so hard that your stomach will be sore as will your throat!!!! Don't rent this!!!! Buy it!!! You'll want to rewatch everyday! Oh and if you thought that Harold and Kumar was funny, this movie is 10000000000000000000000000 times better! What an awesome movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005U2LM|5.0|This is a good cd. I was shocked that this didn't really sell when it came out. Though no ODB (RIP), they still find a way to hold together. This shows that they could still make good music. RZA does all the production except for one song. Guest appearances include Streetlife, Flavor Flav, and Ron Isley also add new feelings to the Wu Sound. Favorites include In The Hood, Rules, Soul Power (Black Jungle), Uzi (Pinky Ring), One Of These Days, Ya'll Been Warned, Babies, Radioactive (Four Assassins), Back In The Game, Iron Flag, and Dashing (Reasons). That basically the whole cd. Highly Highly recommended.
0684135051|4.0|I loved the down to earth style this book was written in, and the encouragment to try your own things, when so many books are written like a school text book.  I have changed some of my ways of knitting because of this book.  My only complaint, that kept it from being a \\"5\\" is the \\"better way to purl\\" twisted the stitches on the other side.
B0000013GT|5.0|I can't believe Outkast only now is getting recognized because of Speakkerbox/The Love Below. I mean recognized by winning awards, producing other peoples songs, and even becoming movie stars. But this is their true masterpiece in my eyes. Nothing really poppy, straight hard core rap. Favorites are as follow: Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), ATLiens, Wheelz Of Steel, Jazzy Belle, Elevators (Me & You),  Babylon, Mainstream, and E.T. (Extraterrestrial). True Hip Hop Classic. Get this and their other albums before SB/TLB.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|The best way for me to describe this is basketball meeting the \\"Dead Poets Society\\". I like both and this movie gets a five star rating. The biggest draw is the positive outlook, but not through rose-tinted glasses. Good things happen and bad things happen, but nothing outrageous (so, it is more realistic). Maybe a little \\"Stand and Deliver\\" thrown in, too. The acting is good and believable. Overall, good flick.
B000001FSR|5.0|Tom Waits' final in his trilogy is an excellent album. This is some vintage music by Waits. He shows so many sides of himself on this record. The songs were written for an opera and cowrote them all with his wife. He accordion is used very well throughout the album. Its cool that he does a crooner voice like Sinatra too. Favorites include Hang on St. Christopher, Straight to the Top (Both Versions), Temptation, Innocent When You Dream, I'll Be Gone, Yesterday Is Here, I'll Take New York, More Than Rain, and Cold Cold Ground. Get this with the other two. Highly Recommended.
B00080Z53O|4.0|Although the subject of the movie is somewhat depressing - the performances are quite remarkable - The musical score, the cinematography and the direction are all superb. All in all - the film is more than worthwhile.  It deserved the Academy Award - It is special.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits' follow up to Swordfishtrombones is a masterpiece. Lyrically superior than the Swordfishtrombones, also has something else in the mix. Three songs with guitar by Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones! The production by Waits is amazing as always. Favorites include Clap Hands, Cemetery Polka, Big Black Mariah, Diamonds & Gold, Hang Down Your Head, Time, Rain Dogs, Gun Street Girl, Union Square, Blind Love, and Downtown Train (would be later covered by Rod Stewart). Waits version is better to me because he sounds like he's looking for redemption when singing it. The music also seems better because of the guitar. But that's my opinion. The rest of the songs are also very good. Highly highly recommended!
B0009EP020|5.0|Green Day are the best punk rock band in the world and this is there best album yet! There is not one bad song on the American Idiot album & is a great ride from start to finish. I had to buy this Imported version when I saw the bonus live disc included. It has the first five songs and the encore performance of Blvd of Broken Dreams from one of there japan Concerts. SO 6 live songs in total. The Live songs sound like you are there with Green Day at the concert, worth ordering just for these tracks, BUT THATS NOT ALL! I checked out the enhanced section on my PC to find the same live tracks on video as well. 30+ minutes of the begining of that same concert!! Excellent Sound & Video Footage. This Imported American Idiot is a MUST BUY for any Green Day fan and is worth the money to import. BUY IT.
B0000024K1|5.0|PE's second is a work of pure genius. A political masterpiece with probably some of the best songs ever heard. Favorites include Bring the Noise, Don't Believe the Hype, Terminator X to the Edge of Panic, Louder Than a Bomb, She Watch Channel Zero?!, Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos, and Rebel Without a Pause. A true classic in hip hop and should be own by all fans of hip hop. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie needs no review.  It is a classic.  It is amazing.  I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she watches it all the time.  This is one of the best fantasy movies of all time.
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA is one of the best lyricists of the Wu Tang Clan (he is also the leader of the group). His second solo album (first is hard to find) is a lyrical masterpiece. The beats by the RZA and 4th Disciple are as dark as the group's first solo album. Plus guest appearances by the Clan don't hurt either. Favorites are Liquid Swords, Duel of the Iron Mic, Living in the World Today, Labels, 4th Chamber, Shadowboxin', Investigative Reports, I Gotcha Back, and Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth (Killah Priest Solo). This is a classic album that should be bought by any fan of the Wu Tang Clan.
B000002ITM|3.0|TESTAMENT - \\"THE RITUAL\\" : TO THE POINT REVIEW. <br /> <br />Track 1: \\"Signs Of Chaos\\" - A 30 sec. intro that is too short to be worthwhile; they should have turned it into a full length instrumental track. <br /> <br />Track 2: \\"Electric Crown\\" - One of Testament's best songs, flawlessly crafted and executed, fantastic Skolnick solo and Billy vocals. <br /> <br />Track 3: \\"So Many Lies\\" - Another of Testament's best songs, again flawlessly crafted and executed, w/ great solo and vocals. <br /> <br />Track 4: \\"Let Go Of My World\\" - Decent track w/ some good riffs; borderline filler. <br /> <br />Track 5: \\"The Ritual\\" - Epic track that misses the mark in a few spots, but has a great solo section. <br /> <br />Track 6: \\"Deadline\\" - Filler track w/ 2 decent solos. <br /> <br />Track 7: \\"As The Seasons Grey\\" - Decent track with some good riffs and a nice melodic solo. <br /> <br />Track 8: \\"Agony\\" - Filler. <br /> <br />Track 9: \\"Sermon\\" - Filler track w/ a decent but monotonous main riff. <br /> <br />Track 10: \\"Return To Serenity\\" - Yes, it's as good as you've probably heard, beautiful track w/ one of the most superbly crafted solos in metal, by virtuoso Mr. Skolnick. Testament KNOWS ballads. <br /> <br />Track 11: \\"Troubled Dreams\\" - Filler track w/ some decent riffs. \\"Return To Serenity\\" should have been the closing track. <br /> <br />OVERALL: Skip this album, and get \\"The Very Best Of Testament\\" to get \\"Electric Crown\\", \\"So Many Lies\\", and \\"Return To Serenity\\", plus a sampler of some of their other great tracks. <br /> <br />ALSO CHECK OUT: \\"First Strike/Still Deadly\\", \\"Practice What You Preach\\", and \\"Low\\" by Testament.
0060763280|4.0|A close friend suggested this book to me, and I picked up two copies (one for me, the other for my spouse) based on this friend's excitement about the book. I must admit that the information within Eker's book is based on a lot of common sense stuff, yet it has been a frequent conversation topic in our home. It has also caused us to research the source of our financial blueprints and recognize that an financial attitude adjustment was warranted. We've also learned several financial terms along the way! <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers who stated that the book is full of sales pitches for Eker's other products, and it is very blatant self promotion. It is evident that books and seminars are the source of the authors' passive income/wealth. (And I've added to his passive income 4 times now!) <br /> <br />Yet, the information within the covers of \\"Secrets of the Millionair Mind...\\" was very useful, and I recommend it to anyone who wonders why they're not advancing financially and want to learn the answer(s) through an easy read.
0553288105|5.0|I have always been a fan of Asimov. Foundation, Robots, Black Widowers. All of it. The Gods Themselves is different. And is one of his best.<br /><br />The astounding imagination is exhibited in his description of another universe, with physical laws being different than ours. His creation of the beings and their lives, including sex life, is astouding. Asimov at his best.<br /><br />What is truly remarkable is the brutal message that energy is not free and that by not using it properly, sustainability is a risk. This message for conservation is presented in a very dramatic manner and is so subtle that it is difficult to relate it to our current challenges. And that is what makes it so beautiful.
B000669GAI|4.0|Pearl Jam have been around since 1991 and have produced many hits since. Many people compare Pearl Jam to other Seattle breakthroutgh bands such as Nirvana , Alice in Chains or even Soundgarden. I am not one of them. To me every band of the grunge scene had there own style , Nirvana and Pearl Jam had the Punk Rock edge to there music while Soundgarden and Alice in Chains were like the metal heads of grunge. Anyways , Lets get to the point and review this Compliation.<br />                          Disc 1<BR>Disc 1 Goes through Ten to No Code. It has there most Comercaiol songs here such as &quot;Alive&quot; , &quot;Jeremy&quot; , &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Spin the black circle&quot;. Disc 1 also gives us 2 remixses for &quot;Once&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot;. This is my favorite disc out of the two and probably goes for the majorty of people who own this greatest hits compilation.<br />     Disc 2<BR>Disc two goes through Ten to there latest alubum &quot;Riot act&quot;. This disc has some comercial songs (&quot;I am mine&quot; , &quot;Black&quot;) but not as many as Disc 1. However , Some of my Favorite Pearl Jam songs are spread through this disc and is definatley a prettier album. A few suprises here, a new mix of &quot;Black&quot; and some songs nobody ever would have expected ( &quot;Elderly women behind the counter in a small town&quot; , &quot;Betterman) but other then that there is nothing special (New unrealesed tracks , Live tracks , Cover songs besides &quot;Last Kiss). <br />Overall this is a great choice if you want get into Pearl Jam but its nothing special. Oh, and one more thing- the Packaging is great!<br />If you liked this, I would recemend : The Who , Nirvana or any 70's hard rock band.<br />        <BR>        Cheers<BR>           and enjoy
0316172324|2.0|Blink is disappointing.<br /><br />The theme is good. The value of snap judgments and thin-slicing is useful. And enjoyable. And entertaining.<br /><br />So what is wrong?<br /><br />Well, Gladwell says it all in the first 5 pages. The rest of the book is examples, and more examples and many more examples.<br /><br />He should have realized that we will 'get it' in a blink. And then left us alone. Except for the beginning, the book is probabaly aimed at satisfying the minimum word count for publication.<br /><br />Just read the reviews and summaries. The book has nothing to add.
B00007K02F|5.0|I see I'm in the minority here but I absolutely loved this movie, my favorite version of Jane Eyre is the movie with Ciarian Hinds but I saw this movie with William Hurt and I just fell in love with this version too and it's my second favorite. Very, very recommended!
0061015725|5.0|It is difficult to choose from Michael Crichton's works, the man who gave dinosaurs a new lease of life. However, Prey is his best yet.<br /><br />Based on Nanotechnology and its risks, the best part of the novel is the tension and involvement he creates. I could identify very closely with the characters and experienced a lot of anxieties as the climax aproached.<br /><br />What is also remarkable is that he manages to teach a lot while entertaining. This is a useful byproduct.<br /><br />This book also brings the conflict home, as a husband tries to battle not only his wife's company, but his wife too. The dilemma is unnerving.<br /><br />Defintely Crichton's best.
6304698690|5.0|The Secret Garden is a beautiful movie! Absolutely stunning and the little girl who played Mary was superb, one of the better child actors I have seen in any movie and I highly recommend this movie!
B0002XDODU|5.0|This CD continues their track record for excellent listening.  Good beat, good vibe, and true to form if you like this group.
B00005JMAH|3.0|There, I hope I grabbed your attention.  Here we go.  3 stars, because this movie has no replay value.  Once you see this practically 3 hour BEAST, you basically never want to see it again.  How many times can these kids keep going back to this school, playing some ridiculous field game, and then \\"running into trouble\\", without the audience getting bored?  Apparently the answer is 3, I'm over it.
B0002X314C|3.0|Overall, this is a great CD.  The lyrical content of some songs irk me, but overall, it's all good!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys has really cemented herself in the world of RnB megastars among the likes of Aretha Franklin, Prince, Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder.<br />Her piano playing magic along with her soulful crooning have made her a favourite with all ages.<br />One of the reasons why so many people are attracted to her music is that she isn't flaunting her body and is more respectable than many other female RnB artists at the moment.<br /><br />Like she demonstrated on her debut she has an undeniable talent and to me this effort far surpasses her previous.<br />She is more mature and aware of herself.<br />On \\"Songs In A minor\\" she was too dismissive at times yet on this album she confirms what she wants to say and gets her message across without side-tracking.<br /><br />Album opener \\"Harlem's Nocturne\\" is exactly like the intro to her other album yet the piano is better and she seems to have matured alot. Her voice is way more solid and fluent.<br />\\"Karma\\" is a standout on the album with her strong belting during the choruses and the lyrics really seem to come across. The production on this song is superb.<br />\\"Heartburn\\" is an amazingly funky song where Alicia finally breaks out of her ballad persona, this girl doen't just sit behind a piano all day. Man, she has a gusto voice.<br /><br />The next track is a song that is a classic and you will instantly know it. \\"If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By\\" strikes a chord with me as it has funk yet that subtleness that confides within Alicia. \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" is the Kanye West produced track that is just so daring. Not many could get away with a phone conversation during the middle of a song but Alicia gets away with it. Naturally.<br /><br />\\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is the best song on the album and grabbed a GRAMMY nomination for Best Song. It is reminiscent of her biggest hit \\"Fallin'\\" and wins me over again. \\"Diary (ft. Tony! Toni! Tone!)\\" is a very personal track where Keys really connects with the listener. Her vocals are excellently superb.<br /><br />\\"Dragon Days\\" is a great lyrical piece of work that uses superb metaphors and imagery. The beats steal the show this time as they add to the story trying to be portrayed. \\"Wake Up\\" is another song where Ms. Keys gets in the mood for loving. This track is the perfect example of Alicia's talent.<br /><br />\\"So Simple\\" has a great chorus, beats and vocals. But probably the factor that contributes most to this song being so good is the voice of Lellow in the background, it's just so damn cute.<br />\\"When You Really Love Someone\\" is just another \\"Woman's Worth\\" yet it is more daring and has better vocals and instrumentation. On this track she tells you what it's like --when you really love someone--.<br /><br />The interlude \\"Feeling U, Feeling Me\\" has a nice calm beat and<br />a superb piano section and hushed vocals from Alicia. Short and sweet. \\"Slow Down\\" has a nice chorus which pulls the song through from a relatively dull verse. The piano reigns supreme and the chorus beat is just tremendous.<br /><br />\\"Samsonite Man\\" is another of my album favourites and leaves me wonder what a samsonite man does or did to her. I love the whole song on a whole and the vibraphone works well with the slightly creepy piano. \\"Nobody Not Really\\" sounds like a day-time soap theme song. It has this strangely magestic flow to it, with the horn section and the soft, dreamy vocals. Overall very good.<br /><br />Alicia Keys is the saviour for the sex-driven female RnB scene at the moment. She is so well respected and her music is truthful and speaks to you from the heart and is really good.piece of work that uses superb metaphors and imagery.
