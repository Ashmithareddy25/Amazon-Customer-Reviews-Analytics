B009T1TUWK|1.0|When BBC Sherlock became a world wide hit, America decided to have a go at it. They failed. BBC captured Sherlock and Watson in the 21st century so brilliantly, this show is nothing in comparison. If you want a very high quality, brilliant Sherlock experience go to BBC's Sherlock. It is one of the greatest shows ever produced, with amazing actors, a captivating script, a story that stays true to Sherlock and to the 21st century.<br /><br />This show is just a typical American ripoff, about a quirky detective who deviates from the norm always to solve cases. In this weird interpretation Watson is an Asian lady and Sherlock is a formerly New Scotland Yard detective working not in NYC. The relationship between lady Watson and Sherlock is so far from what BCC captures--this show is a joke and an insult to the amazing job BBC did in their Sherlock.<br /><br />I can't believe so many people enjoy this show. If you want some boring crime show to pass the time, watch this one because there are more episodes. But if you want quality story acting and general brilliance, if you want the Sherlock experience--go to BBC's Sherlock and don't look back.

B0089LOKHG|2.0|I loved the first two books and after waiting for a year for this one to come out, I expected a whole lot more.  There are just so many unanswered questions, who did she end up with, what happened to Hana, what happened after the wall came down? I just felt like it needed another chapter or and epilogue to wrap it up and answer all the questions. I am disappointed in how it ended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has me hooked. The graphics are great and keeps me entertained.<br />Lots of hidden treasures within as well! I'm saving up to buy myself a Zebra!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Haven't received this as I just ordered it.  However, saw the concert on PBS and enjoyed every minute, so I am very anxious to receive this CD and enjoy all over again!
B008N2Z1L0|3.0|There are a few listenable songs on this the cd, LOVE IS A COUNTRY is the obvious gem of the album which appeals to me but there are some interesting vibes if you listen closely to a few of the others songs such as FIRST ONE IN THE CAR, WON'T BE LONG that might remind you of some of their earlier songs. I wonder how many will find one of the songs with the same beat as a early Rod Stewart song? I did find a lot of references in these songs to war and soldiering which reminded me of the 60's and 70's antiwar efforts. Their BRINGING DOWN THE HORSE is a much better CD for those with taste for pop music.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was such a light and refreshing read, even a bit suspenseful. I loved the characters, very believable, funny and sometimes sad. I would recommend this to book clubs. I didn't think I would really like it. I actually purchased it on a whim.

B00846REIS|4.0|For those who found Fifty Shades of Grey psychologically fascinating but a bit sexually outside their comfort zone this novel is a great fit.  For fans of  the psychological aspect... EVERYBODY has issues in this series!  It's a great romp.  I can't wait to start book number two!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Absolutely wonderful and SO romantic!  So different than anything he has ever done before.  The mix of songs in Italian, Spanish, French and English are a special treat!  Light a candle, pour a glass of wine and enjoy with someone you love!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a funny book that had lots of detail and really explained Greg's time at the \\" dance.\\" I loved this book.
0984725113|5.0|Today media and politicians seem to thrive on providing a continuous stream of apparently &#34;meaningful&#34; sound bites.  A condition I find similar to what Nassim Taleb points out in his book (Fooled by Randomness) as noise, which we treat as meaningful and react to emotionally.  Race Against the Machine cuts through some of todays noise and brings into the conservation a good view of a rapidly changing world driven by technology and the underlying causes of issues such as job loss.  Not a doom and gloom book, rather a book that helps focus issues in a meaningful context and prods us to think about what is affecting our lives - a refreshing change from floating in a daily sea of noise.  Worth reading.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I LOVE this album. It is perfect. It is a bit different from Some Nights but still an great album.

B00B3MN65K|5.0|On his latest album, Josh Groban does not dissappoint. He once again brings serious, heart felt lyrics, vocals, and arrangements. On &#34;All that Echoes,&#34; Josh does exactly what we Grobanites expect him to do. He's giving the world beautiful music. &#34;Brave&#34; is an excellent lead single, and who doesn't love Josh Groban on a duet? I seriously hope the world loves this album as much as I do.
0307951529|5.0|I received this book for free through a contest on Chris' blog (The Art of Non-Conformity).<br /><br />I have had the opportunity to meet him on both book tours and he is a very inspirational guy!

This book shares the struggles of everyday people and how they build their own small business in good and bad times.<br /><br />p.s. the illustrations by designer Mike Rohde are awesome!

B008220DIC|5.0|A mesmerizing masterpiece wailing away at the sea's edge, or Anderson's madness, maybe both. See the transfer of power between the men, the Promethean endowment given to dominate becomes sex. If you know much about life, that shouldn't disappoint your sense of reality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awsome just like temple run but easyer i highly<br />Recommend it \\"ITS AWSOME\\". You should download it especially if you love to<br />Get your fingers tapping and sliding.!!!!!!
B001B2KXX0|2.0|I love the story Rebecca (it alone receives 5 stars from me), but this edition was so poorly made that by the second time I opened the book the entire back binding had detached. It gets two stars because the pages were actually in fine shape. But I would not buy an &#34;International Collectors&#34; edition again.
1451695195|5.0|It is a very touching account of his journey.  It can make a non-believer into a believer. My husband and I shared many parts of the book together.
B002UNMW7O|2.0|The risk of this franchise falling flat on its face was high.  For one it has been too long since the original came out and second the cast has moved on from that period of their lives and careers.  Add that to the writing/directing/producing behind the project and it was a recipe for a let down.  That being said, it was better then I had expected but fall short of continuing the story of the first movie meaningfully.<br /><br />The acting was flat, the jokes were old, the cliches were over a decade old, and the situations setting up the plot had too many holes.  The movie did do a good job in going over the back story of el Duce but spent too much time on it and not enough time on what the brothers were doing between the movies, or how they fared with their calling going silent after the mission was over.  The new characters were too shallow and at times reaching to mimic their original castings so their story colors were muted and stale.<br /><br />Still the movie was entertaining, had some really funny moments and strung along the narrative in a better manner then today's Hollywood reliance of reboots, formulated sequels, and conceptual adaptations.  There were far less shocking or hilarious moments in this movie from the original but it was better then nothing.  There were plenty of tie-ins with the first movie and nods to past characters that worked well and made the movie more comfortable for a fan of the first, but it just felt like there could have and should have been more, more passion, more humor, more vigilantism, more consequences, more seriousness.  The only thing holding me back from 3 stars was the stilted acting and tired dialogue.
B003L77GGK|4.0|I love this product because I love the show. Jensen and Jared (Dean and Sam) are awesome actors and really make it believable to their audience that they are bothers. They are sarcastic, witty, and just fun to watch, and did I mention how hot they both are? I love Cas too! He is so awkward and it is hilarious to see! I gave it a 4/5 because in one of the episodes the dvd skipped otherwise I would have given 5 stars! Really great show!
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|More an engineer person I am but lately found HTML5 is quite interesting and this book gives a very good perspective!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|cool I have it I can put my music so cool I wake up institly I gave it 5 stARS SOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Could not put it down, loved the twists and turns. Fell in love with these amazing characters. A must read!
0984183523|5.0|For anyone interested in MC, especially at a top firm, this book is a must read. It's far more comprehensive than Case In Point, and after reading it you'll have a real understanding of how to handle all types of case interviews and what firms are really looking for.
B0018M6J90|4.0|I have seen this movie many times, and watching the interplay between Amy Adams and Frances McDormand is worth every cent I paid for the movie and every minute I've spent watching it!  McDormand is a wonderful actress, and I can only hope that one day Adams will get the recognition she deserves as well.  I watch the whole thing with a smile on my face and have become a huge fan of them both -- although I have loved McDormand's performances ever since Fargo and Mississippi Burning.<br /><br />Do NOT write off this movie because of the few negative reviews here.  It is charming, amusing, and a real treat.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|Good info, which is easy to understand.  For a beginner, this is very useful.  It answers questions and gives new information.
0316228532|5.0|Who knew she could write something not Harry Potter?  Never could get too involved in the Potter stories, but when Rowling published this one, I had to have a look. It held my interest, beginning to end.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I have been using this product for the past 3 months with good results.  This adapater is comparable to an internal 1GB NIC.  It has great speeds with no lost packets.
B007WOA1IS|2.0|Was going to London for a first time and bought this book.  Honestly I could have found most of the info on the Internet!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker was an excellent read. I couldn't put it down.  You fall in love with Christian Grey over & over again!
0307949486|5.0|This entires series will keep you hooked. It is absolutely captivating from beginning to end. I would recommend to anyone. Not for children though.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This story is about teenagers so keep that in mind when reading this book as I have seen a lot of people not notice this when buying this book. If you are like me and teenage love stories annoy, bore you or both I would not recommend this. However if you find them sweet and love a perfect romance story with twist that all turns out wonderful in the end you will love this book.<br />Hopeless was super predictable, I knew the plot aside from ****spoiller sky being kidnapped ***spoiler*** from very, very early on. I mean like the first 50 pages early on and yes I was dead on because really the author seems to almost be begging you to figure it out.<br />Sky and Holder were both super annoying at times and there is one dry humping scene that really turned me off but there were some parts of the book that were not so bad.<br />The first half of the book was really, really boring. To be honest I have NO idea why Six was even needed? She could have been left out of all the book and you would not have missed her for a second.<br />I can see why teenagers would fall in love with this book but not me. It was simple, a simple fast read that won't challenge your way of thinking or your mind. Not all together a bad thing but with the subject matter this covers you can do better. Not geared towards adults tho! This is very much geared towards YA crowd so keep that in mind when buying this!
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|I thought it was a decent movie for some action and adventure. Decent story line and plot. Entertaining enough to be satisfied.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this movie was highly entertaining. I certainly recommend it. And the actors were lovely. Sam Mendes did a nice job with this twenty-third (or is it more?) Bond film. The only thing about it that nags at me a bit is that there is so much in the plot that doesn't make an awful lot of sense.<br /><br />The good things first, and there are plenty of them. As we would expect with a Bond movie, the exotic locales and cinematography are stunning, the chase and fight scenes cleverly shot, and the women are beautiful. (Although the ladies, frankly, don't have much to do; this is definitely a guy's world.)  Best of all are the actors (which is nice, since many of us don't bracket \\"Bond films\\" and \\"acting\\" in the same thought). Daniel Craig is quite an effective James Bond. He may be a bit stone-faced, but who wouldn't be, after years in the Secret Service as a Double O agent? He has charisma and presence, and his dry delivery works for the role. I particularly liked his interactions with the truly fun-to-watch M-obsessed villain, Raoul Silva, played to the gleeful hilt by the masterful, versatile Javier Bardem. As M, the MI6 boss with an iron will, and ethics I consider a bit shaky, Judi Dench is also a pleasure to watch. Ralph Fiennes, another renowned thespian, does a turn as Mallory, a government official, in charge of national security, who is both angered by and protective of the indomitable M. Two old-new characters are reborn, so to speak, as young MI6 operatives: Naomie Harris as a pretty field agent--oops, can't give too much away--called Eve, and Ben Whishaw as Q, the Head of Q Branch and purveyor of weapons and tech gadgetry. Mr Whishaw, a stage and screen actor of impressive range and chameleon-like ability, gives Q's youthful arrogance an appealing edge. With a cardigan, rather than a lab coat, draped over his delicate frame, and a flutelike voice that contrasts with Bond's harsher tones, he represents the future of the Secret Service--cyberespionage as opposed to the old-school, hands-on, shoot 'em or shag 'em variety of spying we associate with Bond. As a result, Q and Bond's snarky exchanges have a touch of humor that is both charming and ironic. Rory Kinnear, another acclaimed stage actor, is fine as Tanner, M's stoic right-hand man.<br /><br />As for the holes in the plot, now that I come to think of it, they really aren't much more than a casual annoyance. What's with the stolen Modigliani? Oh well, I suppose it was just another of Silva's sideline jobs. Why leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, when you aren't going to provide Bond with some kind of backup, any kind of backup? Why didn't Bond himself call for backup when he found that his arsenal had been sold, and all that was left to him was a rather old rifle? Why lead the villains to a remote Scottish manor, where there was no likelihood of support from The Good Guys? Why did the old gamekeeper Kincaid--played by Albert Finney--use a very visible flashlight on the moors, for pity's sake?<br /><br />Since this is a Bond movie, I guess those things don't matter. Common sense doesn't really matter in the world of MI6 espionage. We're all just in it for the fun.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have read all the books and loved them. This is an outstanding show, the acting, script, and plot are all better than just about everything else on TV. The Blu Ray quality is fantastic also.
0061191981|5.0|I love, love Gordon Ramsey! Everything he has done I have been in love with and this book is no exception. This is not really a memoir about his life tho. He touches on his life a little but but this is largely about his career. Why he chose cooking and how he got as famous as he is now.<br />This is not going to be for everyone as he talks a lot about Chefs that to be honest with you I have never heard of but then again that does not shock me as the only ones I really know are who I see on TV. If a lot of detail about cooking and Chefs you may or may not know would bore you tho this is not a book you will love.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|OK.  I'm biased.  There is no album this fellow has done that I don't like.  He has one of the best voices around today and I love listening to it.  The album is a pleasure to hear.
B0000039QA|5.0|ok 1st off i shouldnt have bought this in the 1st place cuz i have an amazon kindle fire.  the only reason i bought it is because it reminded me of someone.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is a great gift for anbody who even remotely enjoys this show. I bought this for my girlfriend and she has a hard time prying herself away from it. Lots of bonus features too.
B004N9DVW8|5.0|Very sweet, goofy and simple movie. No matter how many times ive watched it, it is still great, and funny!

B006MW3V6U|4.0|A very good tale and a good representation of an era gone by.  I look forward to watching Season 3.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Love this book I didn't want it to end. Fantastic take on religion and the animal kingdom.  Without a doubt one of my favorites.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|We typically are Denzel Washington fans but the story line and dialogue really turned my wife and me off.  We have no problem with language so long as it supports the story and there is a meaningful story line.  Neither was present in this movie.  I gave it 1-star because that is the lowest you have.  I would expect (& hope) Denzel Washington's future roles are nothing like this.  He is too talented for this.
B00008CMR6|5.0|My personal favorite John Wayne Movie!<br /><br />This film has everything!!!  A train robbery, saloon fights, shootouts, beautiful women in distress, and of course the great John Wayne.  One of my favorite westerns of all time.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read I love the detail and humor it's a ma zing
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This movie is truly a masterpiece. The way the whole story is an illusion is brilliant. I wish there were more movies like this one. Any chance I get I always love to watch this movie.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The story line in this was typical Ian Flemming style with some surprizes as well.  Daniel Craig as Bond is a definite plus for this movie - he is among the best of the Bond portrayers.  There are also some unexpected surprizes in the outcome.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Disc 1 includes the film plus deleted and extended scenes, Disc 2 includes a 7 part 'making of' documentary and many other extras.<br /><br />The sound and picture quality are excellent.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the acting of Robert Downey Jr., Terence Howard, Gweneth Paltrow or Jeff Bridges; the Iron Man comic series or comic book action movies.<br /><br />In addition to the stand out performance by Mr. Downey, Jon Favreau's direction is slick, sharp and fast-paced.  The script is intelligent and fun.  This one is one of the best of this genre!
0525421580|5.0|The book itself, physically was perfect, no scratches or dents from shipping but the story itself was not consistent, it was kind of bad in the beginning but just continue, it will pay, also the ending just made you beg for so much more
B0000DZTIL|3.0|one of them type of movies. It's okay<br /><br />The Wraith (Special Edition)<br />Charlie Sheen<br /><br />How do you rate this product?
0451232852|2.0|I've read Follett's wonderful \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and the follow up book, \\"World Without End\\".  I was expecting much the same. I was very disappointed.<br />My problems with the book are:<br />1.  Tries to do too much with too little. The book starts out as five separate stories which I presume somehow come together. I have yet to read any novel which manages to cover five stories and do them well. It just gets too choppy. This book is no exception. If he had focused on 2-3 stories, he might have carried it off.<br />2. The characters are somewhat wooden. I was never convinced about their emotions. It seemed that much of it was written by an new novelist, not an experienced one. The emotions are never really developed. When a housekeeper get pregnant you would expect a huge scene, but there is about half a one. When one woman decides to give up the man of her dreams, her physical reactions are poorly described.<br />3. I liked the historical content (pre WWI at the start of the book) but some of the conversations seemed almost copied from another source. They seem like history book statements rather than conversatons. I never felt the underlaying tension of the world going to war that was attempted. There are conversations about the reasons for the war and the personalities of the Kaiser and other kings, but it was dull and with little tension.<br />4. Follett uses sexual relationships as almost a required element instead of a conflict. There is little if any real development and it all seems a little silly and predictable.<br />5. Covers too much physical territory. The stories jumps from Russia, the US and England. In \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World Without End\\" Follett has a lot of different stories but they are all in one place. Thus the location untils the characters. Also in these books, Follet was able to give us a sense of place because he could describe the setting in some detail. In \\"Fall\\", nothing seemed to bring the characters together (at least for the time I bothered to read the book). He glosses over the details of the various settings. One exception was the description of coal mining and the dangers. An explosion at a mine and the following strike was handled well, but it was dropped for too long of a time. I wish he had done that with the rest of the stories, I might have continued reading it.<br /><br />I tried to read it until I finally gave up less than half way through. I wanted and expected a page turner like \\"Pillars\\" or at least \\"World Without End\\".  I did not get it. The book will be donated to the library. Perhaps someone else will like it.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Well made. Impressive amount of power in such a compact design. I can see a plethora of uses for this, and it's definitely handy to have such a small PC around. Honestly, I'm still surprised at how speedy it is with Ubuntu.

My entire iracing computer uses nothing but Logitech products and they are the best. I would give it a five star without question if I could figure it out!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't hardly put it down!  I also read Gone Girl and liked it. I will be reading Sharp Objects now can't wait!
0525478817|5.0|This book started my John green addiction, it was amazing as my title stated and it made me cry and felt as though the characters were my best friends and I was so sad when it ended all together the best book I've read
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Waited long time for book to release and was sadly disappointed. The dialog seemed to lack personality. The over book just fell short and I lost interest.
143911000X|5.0|Yeah I know it's a bit of an unconventional gift for a girl to buy for her boyfriend, but we're big fans of the show.  He LOVED it.  I admid I read bits and pieces of it and got a good laugh as well.
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|Love Stargate SG1. Season 2 is just as fun as Season 1. However, image quality on Amazon Instant video is quite terrible.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I like novels that are difficult to put down while reading, and this book did not fit that category for me. I enjoy his descriptive style of writing, though,  being able to invision the town, hotel, diner etc. Would I read another Jack Reacher? - probably.
B008PWUTSI|5.0|great product -- fast shipping<br />works wonderfully with my kindle<br />great construction and colorful<br />would like it to be a little larger though

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I've had my Lifeproof case for about two months and I'm very happy with it. After reading the reviews before purchasing my case, I researched all sites I could find on iPhone four cases and finally decided that the Lifeproof case was the one for me in spite of many negative reviews on this case. I have dropped my phone several times since having my case and my phone and case did not have any damages. I especially like that the phone easily slips out of my pocket when I need it. I would recommend the Lifeproof phone case to others.

B005H9B44A|4.0|The running theme of Thor could have come from a Shakespeare play. Two brothers vying for the approval of their father, the king. Good special affects with a blend of adventure and humor. Not terribly deep, but fun. It does kind of lose steam toward the end though.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|Very entertaining movie!  The state of the planet after humans and machines battle to the death.  Are we living in the real world or a world created by the matrix?  What exactly is the Matrix?  There are some awesome lines in this movie!  Action scenes galore.  Heros to root for and villians to root against.  Blossoming love and a guy who believes already?  Will Neo believe?

B005ETA5K2|4.0|Product is a little difficult to get up and running, its not &#34;plug-and-play&#34; so you will need to understand how to disable your built in wi-fi adaptor and to select the right channel and to do some set up things. It will freeze up a bit say one every 3 days and I have had to just unplug it and let it reset for 10 seconds then plug it back in. Recommend getting the +10db gain antenna for like $6 to go with it, significantly increases signal strengths. It also seems to freak out and be uncompatible with USB 3.0.<br />All in all I am happy with it, affordable, does what it's supposed to, and if you are deployed and don't get a room that wins the &#34;Wi-Fi Lottery&#34; then this can keep you from having to sit outside to talk to your loved ones on skype etc.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Joss Whedon has created what is probably going to be a mainstay for generations to come. Great character development, along with top notch story telling provides for hours of viewing enjoyment if yo are even remotely interested in this genre.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An excellent story about cunning and revenge. Keeps the reader just barely in the loop until the last page. Super main character.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|the whole family loves this movie. If you havnt seen it and enjoy clean humor this will be good one for you to watch.
B0073B587E|5.0|If you have an iPad, and you enjoy playing music then you should get one of these immediately. I've had a Fender accoustic I bought years ago and on 3 seperate occasions I have tried to take it up and learn it. I couldn't make it happen, my hands are beaten up from years of munitions handling, and arthritis, and it hurts to much to build up the strength and caluoses. This allows me to learn, it's fun, it teaches you cool songs right out of the box. Simply amazing and the looks it gets when you bring it out are akin to driving up in a Porshe. I learned &#34;House of the Rising Sun&#34; in two nights!<br />CONS: Wish it was Lightning Port Ready, not enough space to put an adaptor in there. Doesn't effect me I have iPad 3 but it could be a problem for others. Also, wish it had a 3/4&#34; out jack to go to an AMP, as it's loud enough to play in a quiet room, but it's not going up to &#34;11&#34; if you know what I mean. And I wish the materials/build were a little more solid or robust to give it a heftier feel when handlign it. Also big design flaw that their is no acess to your &#34;sleep screen&#34; button. So if you want to take a break you have to open it up and manually push the button to black your screen to save battery.<br />All in All one of the favorite &#34;guy toys&#34; I have ever bought, and only $80!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I like it but it could be better<br />I like the third wheel much better then this book<br />O well

B000GCFG7E|5.0|I'm repeating myself, but I love all of Child's Jack Reacher books. Fast pace, action packed, what else can I say?
B007EECSFA|3.0|For some reason I found that this book dragged during the first part of it.  It definitely was not a book I couldn't put down but I was interested in how it would end.  The latter part of the books kept me interested to the point I couldn't and didn't put it down.  I enjoyed how it ended and sort of took me by surprise.  Maybe I am not a good detective.
1934030198|5.0|Most thorough and comprehensive triathlete book I've ever read. Easy to understand and presented in an easy step by step format. Guaranteed to bring success to those willing to follow the methods and training procedures outlined and discussed in this book.

1451629192|4.0|The story can be quite graphic but at the same time the honest and open testimony helps explain how this young victim survived her captivity.  It is a heart wrenching memoir.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing. This story really tugged at my heart and I felt everything Sky was feeling. I haven't read a book that actually made me cry on more than one occasion in a LONG while - because I was so invested in their story. But that's just a testament to how well the author wrote Sky's story. It's beautiful, and I was pleased to see such a strong female character. Read this book.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Had a hard time getting started on this book. I put it down and kept coming back to it, and after about half way through the plot thickens and you want to keep reading to find out the secret. A little to wordy for me at times, but a good read, and as I said, it takes a long time to get into the meat of the book. Hang in for the first half, the second half is worth it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Boasch grows on you.  Always crossways with his superior.  Always sniffing the murder's trail, even in the cold case.  A quick read because I could not lay it down.  I loved it.

0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light gets into the action immediately and doesn't stop until the very end. Several times thoughout the book, I found myself getting the shivers, stopping and re-reading in shock, and even on the verge of tears at a couple points. This book is a very fitting conclusion to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />Finished by Brandon Sanderson after Mr. Jordan's passing, the book was written with the utmost respect to the source material. Though Sanderson's voice is uniquely his, it doesn't stand out too much from Jordan's previous work, such that it kept me engaged with rarely a thought that it could be a different author writing.<br /><br />This is the book about Tarmon Gai'don, The Last Battle. Sanderson does an amazing job of portraying not only the overall battle, but allied and enemy tactics, individual fights, and other crucial operations. As anyone who has come this far in the series should rightly expect, people will fight and people will die. Their deaths will be mourned, but at the same time, their lives will be celebrated.<br /><br />Though some tantalizing threads are left knotted, the majority are satisfyingly unraveled and concluded. Characters who have sat at the sidelines throughout the series arrive to fight in all their glory. Visions, dreams, and prophecies are fulfilled (though not always as one might expect).<br /><br />Though the decision to delay the e-book release was a huge misstep by the publishers, everything else was done right in concluding this series. Mr. Jordan himself wrote the final scene himself before he passed, and it has been included largely unaltered.<br /><br />Though I am sad this long, long adventure is now over, I am simultaneously glad it was able to be concluded. I started the series about a decade ago, and others have been at it since the very beginning. For myself and many others, The Wheel of Time became a significant part of our lives. And for me at least, it will continue to be.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Jordan for all that you gave us. And thank you, Mr. Sanderson, for respectfully and wonderfully seeing Mr. Jordan's work completed.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Good game.  Good sound.  Good animation. A little harder to control than arrow keys; therefore, a harder to complete levles.
0060254920|4.0|I never actually read this as a kid or saw the movie from a few years ago but was checking it out at the local Barnes & Noble awhile back and after price checking it from my phone to Amazon and seeing it cost a fraction from Amazon, I went ahead and bought it.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to stand out as a favorite with my 3 year old son but he still enjoys it whenever we select it for bed time reading.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is a great movie with an all star cast. This is one of Ryan Philippe's best role in my thoughts. Love It. It has a twisted story line but a good one.
0062082353|4.0|I ordered this book when I heard of Kyle's tragic death at the hands of another soldier whom he was trying to help.  Knowing &#34;how the story ends&#34; made the more personal parts dealing with his plansl and family life a little hard to read.  He and wife Taya had lots of plans, and he was putting them into action when he was murdered from behind.<br /><br />A good read from the equipment and tactics standpoint, and interesting to see short inclusions from his wife, describing the effect on she and the kids whenever he deployed or returned.<br /><br />Here's hoping that the military puts a huge priority on helping returnees deal with PTSD
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great writing style very intelligent without being pretentious. Gives you a great overview of the law. A really great read.

B003Y5HWJU|4.0|The movie was good, and I will order Season 2. A little dull at times, but stay with it, looking forward to Season 2.
031236198X|5.0|this book can be read in one sitting.  It is written simply but can be applied to any group of people.  It helps the reader to understand what motivates different people in a group and how taking responsibility can lead to personal growth.  It also has a message to combat &#34;sameness&#34; and &#34;We've always done it that way&#34; syndrome.  Highly recommeded for anyone working with groups.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|One of the rare times that something works so good that you are surprised. I love this product and use it often.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Atmosphere ... atmosphere ... atmosphere. It looks like it would be hard to say as a potential tongue-twister, but it isn't. However, say \\"Sinister\\" over and over as fast as you can, and ... Class A Tongue Twister. Much like the story that makes up this little gem.<br /><br />There is something to say about movies that can be frighteningly good--the kind that give you shivers down your spine and make the hair on your arms stand on end--without any over-the-top gore or torture porn thrown in to make up for shoddy scripts and poor acting. Classic movies that pulled it off stunningly were \\"The Shining,\\" \\"Poltergeist,\\" and \\"The Exorcist,\\" to name a few.  More recently, we've seen \\"Insidious\\" and \\"The Cabin in the Woods\\" do some magical stuff without all that bloody mess. Now we can add \\"Sinister\\" to that list.<br /><br />\\"Sinister\\" relies heavily on atmosphere, e.g. creepy, looped chanting and menacing music, dark hallways and darker corners, and a story that never gives you what you expect--always keeping you guessing. It was eerie, bizarre, and it kept my attention throughout.<br /><br />The only reason I took off half a star for the movie in general was because the script was cheesy in spots. It was basically some awesome tension-tinged dialogue, and then something totally off the wall that no one has ever said or would ever say given the situation at hand. Those parts should have been rewritten or just edited out altogether because they were few and far between.<br /><br />All in all, I found \\"Sinister\\" to be a well-crafted, well-acted, and well-filmed movie--a feather in the cap of the horror industry.<br /><br />Movie - **** 1/2 Stars<br />PQ - *****<br />AQ - *****
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|We have all the seasons of Sons of Anarchy, and we hope there will be more seasons to come.Keeps you on your toes to find out whats around the corner.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|This is a great cd and it was in perfect condition just as it was described when it arrived.  I love it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoyed the all three seasons. Can hardly wait for the next to start. The depiction of period, artistocrats, the classes and that the classes have classes. I learned quite a bit about the early 1900's. There was nothing I didn't like.
1601254679|5.0|Unless you're statting out a BBEG creating unique and well equipped NPCs is a chore, and that is where this book shines. What it is also surprisingly good for is giving players ideas. If you're uninspired by the core classes and your usual archetypes, or struggling for some unique character concepts this book can help as well. Each NPC is done well enough that it would be no problem to pick them up and play them for a one shot or year long campaign.<br /><br />Everything is brilliantly organized, gorgeously illustrated, and decently written. My only complaint is that there were too few good aligned NPCs. The best 'villains' are the ones a paladin can't smite and a cleric can't stand against on principle.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|it was in good shape,good and clear quality picture and sound.now i almost have whole series but one.for anyone who like things like this get the whole series

B009439HEY|5.0|This disk clearly defines the change that occurred when, sadly for this life long Genesis fan Steve H departed \\"..All Chang'in\\".<br />Steve Hackett clearly redefines the the unmatched multidimensional sound of Genesis and has re-energized the foundations which made Genesis the band that it was.  A music analogy is how Stokowski interpreted the brilliance of J.S. Bach.<br />The timelessness of the what Gabriel, Banks, Collins, Rutherford + Hackett created is louder and clearer, especially when introduced by Mr.Hackett's acoustical vignettes as typified on Th Musical Box.  There seems to be a deliberate poignancy to his selection vocalists, especially on the track Simone Collins sings- father son tradition. The most moving of them for me  was the sound of a female vocal on Ripples.<br />These tracks make up for some lost imaginative and influential lead guitar Genesis has obviously missed, even in the revitalized Genesis of the '80's.<br />Bravo !  Don't \\"just sit there\\" boys. Bring on the Genesis \\"To Revelation \\" tour!<br />Anybody listening out there??
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Could be fun, BUT ridiculous amount of ads. Played for 15 minutes and uninstalled. Most badgering of any game this year.

B006HL9G10|5.0|A girlfriend of mine has one of these glass/crystal bowls that she spent around $200 on.  The sound from one of these is close.  The bowl gives off vibrations which help tune into a more tranquil mindset,  great for meditating.  First thing that I did was make a recurring pattern, saved it, hooked the phone up to bluetooth bose speakers.  It was great!  I used it to study for a couple of hours, then turned the volume down, changed it to 8 hours and slept like a baby.  Great app, thanks FAOTD because I'd have never know this existed otherwise.<br /><br />I rated this based solely on the apps performance.  As others have mentioned, I would also like for the devs to explain their permissions.

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Only disappointing thing was that Edward Norton was not in this movie.  But the  Hulk character  itself was done better than the first two Hulk movies.  I  hope there are more Avenger movies to come.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Do not be fooled by cheap controllers made by 2nd hand producers. While this controller may cost a little bit more...it is well worth it. Other controllers broke, or wouldn't charge correctly. This one is the original and pefect!

B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Yet another great Dr. Seuss movie! The colors and images are very crisp on the Blu-Ray. Great movie for anybody who loves Dr. Seuss stories and maybe even for those who have not discovered him.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading all of the hunger games i have decided this is my favorite and you probably will to i hope.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Love it!!!!!!  Will use it daily.  A must to relieve stress and for some relaxation.  Get while it's free On Amazon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great Great game. Fun for any one six to sixty. If can't  have your own horse in real life this is the next best thing.
B003UM8T3U|5.0|Godard's mastepiece is everything and more.  A landmark in world cinema that put a great big stamp of legitmacy on the French New Wave.  I remember my first viewing of this revolutionary work and saying &#34;what's the big deal&#34;?  But it also left me with the nagging impression that there was something more behnd the &#34;cool&#34; surfaces of its characters, and the otherwise pedestrian, even simplistic, story.  Upon second, third etc. viewings, Godard's genius and true achievement come to life.  It is a film about the cinema and its influences upon us and our behavior.  It is a film about the influences of art in general, and the need to strive for an original statement in the face of such art.  It is a love story that transcends the rapid, jump-cut rhytms for which Godard is deservedly famous.  Notice how the film is all movement, action and speed when outside, but slows down to a languid, dream-like pace when Belmondo and Seberg are togehter in the bedroom.  Outstanding and worth every penny of the Criterion Blu-Ray price.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I know that you can get a laugh out loud if you read this book. I thought this book  was  AWESOME!
0061900656|4.0|Good shape. Some writing on cover, but glued first page and problem fixed.  What do you expect for a &#34;used book&#34;?
1601251556|5.0|Works great!  My player characters love it.  Big enough for most dungeons and the the fact that it is double-sided makes it very versatile.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|With the free version you only get a taste of it, it was fun but not sure I'm willing to pay 2.99 for a hidden object game
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I have just started this game and its so much fun. I cannot wait to finish it. The sound affects are really cool. Especially the little voices that you hear every once and a while. That really creeps me out, but hey really cool app. The down side is, it kind of takes a long time for the data to download after you purchase the app. The waiting pays off. You will get chills when you hear the music and sounds. I hope whoever gets this app really enjoys it, because I did.

0937381888|5.0|Everything you want (and need) to know about home brewing.  I really like how the book is formatted.  It starts out with a high level over view, then goes further in depth. A great resource for the home brewer.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King, but I haven't *really* loved one of his books since &#34;It.&#34; That one was a masterpiece, and I feel like &#34;11/22/63&#34; lived up to the legacy. Beautifully written, and there was one paragraph -- I don't have my Kindle with me or I'd key it in -- that when I read it, I thought, &#34;That has to be the most beautiful paragraph ever written in the English language, or maybe any language.&#34; It was heartbreaking.<br /><br />As with any King story, you really get to know the main character intimately, and this one, I fell in love with.<br /><br />I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it. If you really loved &#34;It,&#34; you will thoroughly enjoy this book.

Saw it on amazon. for three dolllars and two fifty shipping and decided why not I usually keep movies for a couple of days anyways.  Save my cash and get to keep the movie my lady likes. I win
0062082353|5.0|I bought this book for my husband, figuring if he didn't like it my son would..  Too my amazement, my husband started reading it the day he got it and every night after work until he finished it.!!!  Couldn't say enough good about it!!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great book. I was blown away. Just when I thought I had it figured out, I was all wrong.  As a parent this made question how I would react.  As someone who sat in a courtroom once, despising the family of a murderer who killed my friend, this has really made me see things from the parents angle.  Incredible book.  Hope there is a sequel someday.
0670026603|5.0|I received a copy of \\"Me Before You\\" by Jojo Moyes in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />This book was one of the best novels I have read in a long time.This novel is beautiful piece of fiction that deals with the issue of assisted suicide, moral obigations, love, respect and tenderness.<br /><br />Louisa Clark,twenty six years old, has recently lost her job at Frank's Cafe, as it was being shut down.She was given three months pay and one day notice.What was she going to do? She had no other skills.Louisa lived at home with her parents,Josie and Bernard,her elderly grandfather who was recovering from a stroke, and her sister Treena and five year old son Thomas.Her parents minded Thomas after school everyday until Treena finished work at a flower shop.But jobs weren't easy to come by,especially in the middle of a recession.They relied on her wages to help out.<br /><br />Then a temporary position, for six months came up for a care assistant for a thirty five year old disabled man, a quadriplegic, during the day to help feed and assist.Louisa applied and had an interview with Camilla Traynor, her son was the quadriplegic.Her son, Will was injured in a road accident two years ago. He required twentyfour hour care, the majority by a trained nurse,Nathan.Camilla had recently returned to work, as a magistrate.This job paid well, but was about mental attitude.<br /><br />Louisa starts the job, but Will is sarcastic and remote.He had been very successful and dynamic in his former life and was having trouble adjusting to his new one.He did not want to live...and Louisa tried to think of ways to change his mind.<br /><br />Will told his mother,\\" I don't want to live like this. This is not the life I chose.There is no recovery, hence it is a perfectly reasonable request to ask to end it in a manner I see fit.\\"<br /><br />The six month deadline was quickly approaching...and Louisa had to show Will that there is a bigger picture and a brighter picture in his horizon.<br /><br />This was such a moving emotional book, I found myself shedding tears along the way.It is a book with a bigger picture,dealing with moral issues and compassion that you will go back and reflect on for years to come.I am so lucky to have read this book.><br />This was such a moving emotional book, I found myself shedding tears along the way.It is a book with a bigger picture,dealing with moral issues and compassion that you will go back and reflect on for years to come.I am so lucky to have read this book.
B008C20TDG|3.0|This book is interesting, and definitely has inspired me to cut out processed foods. However, the 30-day program has been very difficult for me (especially since I'm doing the IBS and auto-immune protocols). I'll be honest, today, on day 24, I called it quits and had some thin mints. I'll still keep up with eating mostly whole foods, but the restrictive program definitely wasn't a good choice for me (and i'm someone who had managed to be successful with weight watchers for a couple of years).<br /><br />now i'm just kind of scared to eat beans, which doesn't seem right.

Also, Asus customer service is<br />  worthless.  See my review of their ASUS P8Z77-V PRO/THUNDERBOLT motherboard, and the problems I had<br />  with it and their great customer service.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|The stories are so similar. This may be better written, or so people say. I read the other quite a while back so I don't remember. Of course I must say that I have never read this type of book before fifty, and was surprised at how much of it I liked. It did get boring, how much detailed sex can you read at one time. So I skipped a lot of it after book one. The only thing that I found annoying was never finding out what was wrong with Ana.<br />At least this story gives resaons for why What's her hame is screwed up. Brain dysfunttion, sorry.<br />I will finish the trilogy and hope no one writes another one.

B008AUGEFC|5.0|One of my favorite books in recent years. Cloud Atlas is a wonderful story about the value of human life, and our tendencies to neglect that value out of our own self interest and greed. Not only is the book very fun (especially the 2 future stories), but it also points out some very true and disturbing things about the world we live in.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br />The 3 things that vastly disappointed me about the movie:<br />1. It failed to REALLY explain the world of \\"corpocracy\\"(government controlled by monopolistic companies. ex. FORD, DISNEY) and connect how our current society ended up there.<br />2. The jumpy scene changes made it impossible to follow easily.<br />3. The Book is a tale of how humanity chose a path that ultimately lead to the complete and utter fall of civilization, and how allowing corporations to supply everything, leaving regular people as just \\"consumers\\" without any real ability to fend for themselves, lead to a post apocalyptic world where people have gone back to their most primitive ways.  The movie leaves this out completely, using the \\"reincarnated souls in love\\" as the main theme. GARBAGE!<br /><br />Read the book, BURN THE MOVIE!

B004FRX0MY|1.0|The app insists on keeping any downloaded files on internal memory and not on the SD card. There's no configuration option for changing the library location.<br /><br />While the application has settings that claim to limit downloads to Wi-Fi only, and to not automatically download new purchases, my experience has been that the application does NOT respect these settings. I learned this when I found my phone downloading a Handel box set I'd purchased, eating up the remaining internal memory on my phone and using my T-Mobile data plan to do it. If I wasn't paying for unlimited data this bug would have cost me a few hundred megs in overage charges. I tried pausing the active download, but the application kept chugging along, giving me no way to STOP the downloads.<br /><br />The application can't be trusted to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveals Amazon has no apparent plans to fix these problems.  If you install it, be sure to have an unlimited data plan, or you WILL eventually get hit with a large data overage charge from your mobile carrier.<br /><br />I'm going to try and find a resolution for these bugs, but if I can't find one I'm uninstalling the application.

B001GXYBY6|4.0|My favorite cartoon as a kid, I really enjoyed this movie. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that there is a (very) little salty language that I found didn't fit in. Trust me, I am not new to inappropriate language, but I found it was out of place and unnecessary when used in this move. Overall, it was a very faithful rendition of Speed Racer. Emile Hirsch was fantastic as usual. He is a very under rated actor. In any case, if you are a fan of the cartoon, you will more than likely enjoy the movie. Salty language or not.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|I grew up on this music. It's a staple in my collection, vinyl, cassette (8 track too), CD, and download!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the choices and options. I do wish it was easier to get gems though. The graphics are very realistic.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|First of all, I liked the book. Don't get me wrong....BUT, I was highly disappointed with the parallels it draws with a few other supernatural/fantasy/mythical teen novels. I loved the first one, and its originality, but the moment John Breed popped up on his Harley, I contemplated not reading any farther.<br /><br />I will read the rest of the series because I spent the money, but I know that even though I'm an avid reader, I'm only finishing the series because I bought the books.
B000XXLY8G|5.0|Boots look great and are very comfortable. Wish they cost less but I will happily buy another pair when needed.
B008Y5OWSO|1.0|This film was marred by accusations of cruelty to animals during production. One assertion was that live horses were bled from the neck without giving them pain-killers so that their blood could be collected and smeared upon the actors in a scene. The American Humane Association (AHA) asserted that four horses were killed and many more injured during a battle scene. It was claimed that one of the horses was blown up by dynamite. This footage appears in the final cut of the film.<br /><br />The AHA was barred from monitoring the animal action on the set. According to the AHA, the owner of an abused horse filed a lawsuit against the producers, director, Partisan Productions, and the horse wrangler. The suit cited \\"the severe physical and behavioral trauma and disfigurement\\" of the horse.<br /><br />The film shows actual cockfights. There were accusations, as well, of decapitated chickens and of a group of cows disemboweled to provide \\"fake intestines\\" for the actors. The outcry against this film prompted the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) to contractually authorize the AHA to monitor the use of all animals in all filmed media.<br /><br />The film is listed on AHA's list of unacceptable films.<br /><br />Amazon should not support cruelty to animals.  This film should be removed from its salable items.  At the very least, Amazon should include in its Product Description a warning about this film's obscene content.  I was shocked and disgusted when I watched this film.  I would never have bought it if I had known what it contained.<br /><br />(The detailed information of animal abuse and legal actions noted above are quoted from the Wikipedia page on \\"Heaven's Gate.\\")
B0069UP2PI|5.0|This movie does a fantastic job of recreating an epidemic from various events that have occurred throughout history and giving it a futuristic spin. I found the film to be very moving and well done.

B00BETX5PS|2.0|We downloaded this movie on out smart TV, but it froze numerous times. It was not my favorite Bond movie, but that is in part to the horrible uploading.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|This DVD set is wonderful and is of a 2010 production, the latest at the Met.  Just wish the production date was given on ad.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I found that the movie was great! I was an avid reader of Hunger Games (even before it was all public and being made into a movie) so I was a little worried the first time I watched it. A while into it, though, I found it was actually fairly true to the book! The characters were spot on. I think Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress, especially in regards to emotions and facial expressions (especially when she's in the tube, going up to the arena - the terror is SO REAL). There were a few very very minor changes, which I think added to the story instead of being a problem. I do wish there were some more special features. I'm not sure if there are more on the blu-ray copy or not. It seems that DVDs that used to be full of fun stuff are now JUST the movie, while the blu-rays are all fun. Makes sense to the company, but it's a bit annoying to us since we don't have blu-ray yet.
0446310786|5.0|If you like to feel like you're with the character I suggest to read this book its amazing and you get to picture how colored people were treated back then compared to now its amazing how much things changed. GREAT BOOK
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved the first two books. They were fantastic! I re-read them again before this one came out just to refresh myself. I was so excited!<br /><br />The third book left me disappointed. The ending doesn't resolve anything. I finished it and thought, really? That's it? What happens to everyone? Does Lena really choose who she does? Why is Alex all of a sudden different? What happens to Hana?<br /><br />There were times it really didn't flow. Julian basically just drops off the earth from the second book. The whole thing felt rushed.<br /><br />Like I said, disappointing. Blah!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Great book that I could not put down. Marcus tells his story of his SEAL training and little about his family and growing up in Texas. Then he takes you through the operation, the rescue and returning to the USA. I gave it 4 stars since there were some errors and what seemed like inconsistencies in the story. For example at one point he falls over 1000 feet down a mountain but then only has to climb 200 feet to get back up to where he fell from. I have all the respect for Marcus and what he fought through to survive.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun game,but some glitches on kindle. My son really enjoys it. Fun for him to find animals and build his own zoo.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|It seems lady gaga has now thought it was time to release a new record, but what a shock this album \\"Born This Way\\" is an abomination on music as well as her other previous albums, she has brought nothing new to her fans or to the others who could potentially in time become fans. This album has brought the same old formula dance electro pop beats and a weak production on set without any thought put behind the music or lyrics, how people think she's creative and diverse is beyond me in short if your looking for real pop singers or singer song writers i'd recommend artist's like linda ronstadt, lisa loeb, amy jo johnson and tracy chapman to name a few and stay away from gaga she's trash at it's finest giving birth musically to such abomination as these jessie j, rihanna, katy perry, nicki minaj, and ke$ha = trash
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Very easy to play and it is a lot of fun. For all ages-my teenage grandson showed me the game. I am addicted.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like the alarm clock feature but the display is way too bright, even on the lowest dim setting.  It would be great otherwise
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Lots of light but practical science (I'm and engineer) supporting a thoroughly enjoyable story line !  Every time a new challenge meets our protaganist he works through it coming out the other side alive. The character is fun and very earthy - you can so comfortably root for him. Yes the editing is not professional but for the price it's super surprisingly enjoyable.
B0051X56FK|1.0|I use to love beyonce back in the day and for her other obvious assets too, however as the years have passed beyonce's music in general as become stale and mundane as the typical trash passed out as so called music on the airwaves and to be blunt i've gotten bored of beyonce since about her third album \\"I am... Sasha fierce\\" her first 2 albums were good but let's leave it at that beyonce since then hasn't shown any maturity or growth as an artist<br />Beyonce at the start of her career was all about empowering women and making women grow strong into themselves as females and make smart choices as well as making some cliche club bangers here and there, but lately as she released her 3rd album along with her latest release \\"4\\" this album has nothing new to offer and quite frankly think she has sold out by mixing with the wrong element namely lady gaga, nicki minaj,and rihanna to name a few and by making this atrocity with nothing but mediocre club records and meaningless lyrics with nothing substantial to offer
0062215507|5.0|I loved everything about this book . . . the trivia, the keepsakes, etc. It was well worth the money.
B0035O66CO|5.0|One of the best films - ever. I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old, same age as Tatum O'Neal. Funny, touching, exciting and well written it explores the relationship between a very savvy young girl and a con artist that may or may not be her father. Set in the depression, the film really seems to capture the culture of the era - cars, language, music and how people struggled to survive. I remember that Madeline Khan stole my breath away from laughing so much, and the movie stole my heart. Watching it again I realized that it has lost one of it's charm and will remain one of my favorites.

030758836X|5.0|A salesperson in my favorite boutique recommended this book--as she could barely stop reading to ring up sales.  She was right--I sat down one afternoon to read and couldn't put it down until I had finished it.  The twists and turns will keep you guessing on what will happen.
B002L7O7XG|1.0|Neither dvd would play in any of our 4 dvd players and we even cleaned em. I was extremely up set and still no refund has bn recived as of march 7th. I am an extremely unhappy customer.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|While not as fun or as spectacular as their previous album, Gossamer is hard not to like.  I was worried when I first heard Take a Walk (the repetitive keyboard riff is obnoxious), the rest of the tracks are basically an updated return to form.  If you enjoyed Manners (I loved it), odds are you'll appreciate this record.  It basically amounts to a shined-up sequel, but for music this good, the result is great.
0375851569|5.0|All children 2 through 5 should have this collection in their library. Very educational for children! I bought this collection as gift<br />for my first Great Grandchild.<br />Iris Stone
B001ANYDAO|5.0|The book unveils the mystery of mastery. We profoundly look for heroes as super humans and we don't stop to see that the environment, opportunity and effort are the key factors to their success.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is extremely addicting. I love the suspense. I had a lot figured out but it was fun seeing that I was write. This book reminds me of my life. Very exciting, I can't wait to read another one of Colleen Hoover's books.

B00BESM14U|5.0|It was alarming to be thrust behind the eyes of a teenager again, and a troubled one at that, but I truly enjoyed the ride. The writing was beautiful and I was rooting for Charlie the whole time. Might be too much reality of modern teen life for some readers.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I was forced to read this for an upcoming adult book club gathering, so admittedly I am the wrong demographic.  Probably a teenager would adore it.  I thought it was mush.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great movie. Had heard a lot about it and had high expectations.  I was not disappointed. It really brought home the difficulty this man had and the toll it took on him.  The actors were very believable,and did a magnificent job.  Definitely recommend this one.
B001LRJH0K|4.0|I like ed harris,, He has played good guys and bad guys with equal skill...In his film he is hired to clean up a town and he does just that......Mortenstern to me is a very underated actor,
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|You know you're in trouble when your favorite tracks are all the the bonus disc that came with the deluxe version.  While there are only one or two songs I dislike (&#34;Stony Ground&#34; and &#34;Sally B&#34; don't do much for me), there's nothing on this album that rank with his best work.  If you buy it, make sure to get the deluxe version, as all the discarded songs are worth the extra cash.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|And action, this fast dexterity game is lots of fun and sharpens your reflexes as you play against the clock
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. It was a perfect blend between the old world of mysterious antiquity and the current world in which we live, quickly turning into the high-tech future. I think that any bibliophile would enjoy this book, as books and print feature prominently in the storyline. This is the first book that I read electronically, on my new tablet mini. This was very fitting (if you've read this book, you'll know why!). The author has a playful way with words and it was a delightful, eccentric read.
B007L4HET8|4.0|The more movies they make it a series it gets harder to reach the heights of the original..I thought the plot in this movie was weak, but what saves the movie is the awesome special effects...
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I just LOVE these series. This one is yet another one that keeps you interested. Each episode is somewhat connected to the previous one and just as interesting. It is too bad that the series only has two seasons because it is superb. Great special effects, great story lines, great performance by cast members and great scenery and panorama; the location filming sites are breathtaking.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|The Dr is absent again, which is disappointing. I do think it is a great time filler during the break in the Doctor's Schedule. I have seen them all now and the Miracle Day series makes watching the first two seasons as back story worth it.
0143120530|5.0|Overall, Moonwalking with Einstein is a very believable and interesting book. Joshua Foer has successfully illustrated in person that everyone can try to achieve a good memory and it is vital to notice that memory is indispensable. This is a very suitable book for people who are taking psychology class, because except their textbooks, they can learn the entreating part of the brain and memory though this book. For the direction of future research, I suggest that the author can also do memory experiments on students to see if these mnemonic tips also work in their learning of different subjects. This book makes a significant contribution to an existing body of knowledge, because it explained and concreted the use of memory in history, other people's different points of view, and his own impressed experiences. This book makes me realize that people's invisible memory is so powerful and it can actually achieve many difficult tasks, such as memorize long poems, readings in foreign language and thousands of digits. I will definitely using these tips in my future learning, and also improve my own memory.
0446577391|5.0|I read my first D. Baldacci years a go and loved it.  I moved on to others over the years.

I assure you it is all you need<br /><br />even if your a well informed fitness guy like myself, this book is great bcuz it will make u feel confident in ur knowledge when every other source is trying to makw u second guess.<br /><br />this is the correct science right here. the laws do not change. they are like the laws of physics for fitness<br /><br />#iotos

B00119ZMKW|5.0|Stargate Seasons in general are excellant watching.<br />In the two-part season opener the Star Gate is destroyed because of an attack on Star Gate command by Anubis.  In episode 8, (one of my favorites), the brainy combat inept SG scientists, (Feldger, Coombs & Meyers), cowboy on up when the chips are down and perform an impromptu rescue of SG-1; who planned to be captured as part of their mission.  SG-1 gets blackmailed by a reporter from earth aboard the new space-capable ship, \\"Promethius\\". Polical aspirations on Earth threaten to usurp General Hammond's command, Senator Kensey is assassinated in broad daylight on earth and General Hammond decides to inform Ambassadors from other major Countries on Earth of the Star Gate program's existance.<br />  Alot of the episodes in season six include earth politics or other planet politics in relevance to the Star Gate program.<br />  Other episode highlights include SG-1 reviving a frozen 'Ancient' discovered in the arctic and Jack O'Neil consents to become a Tok'ra, in order to thwart a fatal 'Ancient' disease consuming his body. In another episode, Jack O'Neil,(now a Tok'ra), is captured & tortured by  Ba'al.  Everytime O'Neil wakes up revived from death in his cell, an ascended Daniel Jackson appears and speaks to him.<br />In the lead up to Season 7 Daniel Jackson seems unhappy with ascention and appears to other SG-1 team members in an elevator on the base, asking for help.

B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good flick with decent acting..<br />Seem to remember some incongruities<br /><br />Would have preferred something a little closer to the arnold version
B000MD9UJC|3.0|This converted one of my MiniMags for more usefulness. The price was close to a whole new flashlight- that's a wash since I don't need yet more small flashlights. Its so bright that I don't miss the focusing of old incandescent bulb. Nested in my backpack, the exposed switch turned it on- for how long I don't know. Can't store it that way! I haven't had it long enough to evaluate battery life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is extremely fun and vary addictive. especially when you have to work long hours like I do.<br />The game will keep you hooked for hours.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds requires concentration and estamation which makes it fun because yo can try it in so many different ways. And i think that's what it is about goodbye I almost forgot it also requires someone with a sharp mind and someone who likes to have fun.
B008YCMM2A|2.0|I feel like all too often critics are afraid to deliver criticism of artists who are established as the best.  And to be clear, I consider Miles Davis to be the best; he is my favorite musician, out of any music genre.<br /><br />Live in Europe 1969...was highly disappointing.  The band hardly ever jived, and Jack DeJohnette booms over everyone with a horribly manic rhythm.  Miles sounds great when he is playing solo, and watching him on the DVD is cool, but this band has no cohesion - it is clear why there was never a studio album recorded by them.  Some of this may be due to the quality of the recording, being that they were playing large auditoriums, but even if the shows had taken place at the cellar door, I doubt the product would have been much better.<br /><br />I would not recommend purchasing this box set for the music, but if you really want to get another glimpse at Miles playing live, the DVD is pretty cool.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi my name is Haley I think y'all need to give more eggs on the tracks and we. Should be able to sell the eggs for coins. And if we like the Facebook page we should get more than 5000 coins we should get 30000 because it's more of a head start. Oh and that person y'all rate by day like for 95000 coins make it more days than the number of days cause some of us go to school and can't play it and some of us work. Y'all should make it like 70 days because some people get real mad and stop playing. But other than that I LOVE this game I play it everyday.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I have to say that I didn't think I would find any of Jane Austin's books better than Pride and Prejudice but alas, I think I enjoyed Persuasion as much, maybe even a little more. I understand this to have been her last novel; she went out well!

B00BETX5PS|3.0|Typical James Bond movie with the suave James Bond and beautiful women and ugly bad guys.  The action was decent.  They don't make James Bond movies like they use to.  Just okay.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|The connection between the show Castle and the Nikki Heat novels and the skill with which this book was written, makes this a can't put it down type of read.  So many levels!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I love Downton Abbey! Can't get enough of it. We really enjoyed this season just as the others, but there is a lot of sadness in this one  because two  of the best characters die.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I have always like Pete Townshend - he hit those hard times but he helped clarify what happened - I knew he was innocent.  He's had quite the life - doesn't show on his face like Keith Richards, that's for sure.  A good book and I enjoy the name dropping throughout the years.
0062014536|2.0|There is really no way to write this review without giving something away so please know that there might be some minor spoilers but I will try to not give anything big away.<br /><br />I really hate to say it but I was bored a lot during REQUIEM. There are two different POVs and neither of them connected with me. There isn't any romance and we definitely don't get the great reunion we want. There are a lot of feelings and fighting feelings and thinking about feelings but with the huge build up and cliffhanger at the end of book 2 I really was expecting more. The only thing that interested me in REQUIEM was the adventure, fighting scenes and the story's pace was decent.<br /><br />The ending didn't leave me feeling satisfied, it feels like something else should be coming next. There is nothing resolved really and you have no clue what will happen next for the characters (or even if some are still alive for that matter). Its open ended and in no way concluded. I guess I was just expecting more from the ending to the series. Bummer.
B007CGRS7I|5.0|I love this book! It's perfect for any aged woman that has ever found themselves bargaining with their inner self about buying too many things, haggling over the cost versus the need for an item, etc. It's hilarious and the British charm is present!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I kept hearing about this movie and saw that it won major awards so I had to see what all the hype was about. I was blown away, stayed on the edge of my seat and was literally shouting at my television (which I never do when watching a movie). It was a very intense, well played, and realistic movie. If I could give this movie a higher rating, I would.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm one of those 'I never write reviews, but felt compelled to write one about this book' people.  I'm also one of the readers who mainlined the entire book in an evening and early morning.  This by far is one of \\"those\\" books that you will read, gasp, say \\"oh my God\\" out loud about a dozen times.  Buy it, steal it, whatever you have to do - read it. For those of you with teenagers, it will be a wake up call.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Upon reading a brief synopsis of this book I yearned to learn more about a country for which I knew so little. Shin's story is gripping from beginning to end. Heart wrenching to say the least. I was astonished how ignorant I was about North Korea and it's ruthless leaders. Maybe, by reading Escape from Camp 14, citizens from developed countries around the world will ignite their leaders to finally end the atrocities of North Korean dictators.<br /><br />Would love to have this story part of every high schools' required reading list in social studies' classes. The author/narrator does an excellent job in all aspects of superb writing and story telling.

B007FC3AAI|5.0|I was please with this movie and the appearance of the casing it was like buy a brand new movie. Very please.
0812973992|2.0|I wanted to like this book, and I spent the first 3/4 of the book expecting all the tales to intertwine masterfully in the end.  I was left disappointed.<br /><br />There are many reviews, each better than this one, that give detail of the plot and the characters within.  I won't dive into the details--I will merely say that the book is extremely well-written.  McCann has a mastery over the English language and uses it well.<br /><br />My main complaint is that there is little drama at the end, no real climax.  The story peters out, and some of the tales continue and some come to a plaintive end.  They all revolve, in some way, around the tight-roper between the World Trade Center, but that feels more like a plot device than a real focal point.  It just feels forced to this reader.<br /><br />I know many people loved the book.  I had expected great things, and I was disappointed.  Perhaps it does reveal the soul of NYC as I had read in a previous review.  Apart from the appearance of the tight-rope walker, the story may as well have been set in Chicago or LA or any other city packed with various individuals from differing socio-economic states.

B004LWZW42|3.0|I'm rating based on an adult watching a movie that I purchased for my son who is 6yrs old.  Based on his feedback and watching the times he has watched it, I give it the 2-3 star rating.  He much rather watch Iron Man 1 or 2 or others than this.

1616550414|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who love the zelda series. The quality of the book is high and a must have for collectors.
0307463745|2.0|This \\"book\\" the size of a journal article drives home a good point of doing doing and doing first, worrying about details and fancy embellishments later. Were 2 hours of my life worth it? May be.  Hence 2 stars instead of 1.<br />In a nutshell,  totally unsubstantiated.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed book 1 from cover to cover.  Book 2 left me unsatisfied and book 3 had the ending i expected.  Of all 3 books the first of the series was the most exciting.  I have not watched the movie and now am glad I did not.
B0006GANN2|5.0|The French Connection set the bar for future NYPD dramas. This movie will bring you back to a time when New York City had a very tough look to both it's environment and it's detective procedures.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It  was a good book<br />I like it  I loved it it was great book. Yeah would u like it
1451695195|3.0|Although I learned some interesting things in the book, I was left with a question of &#34;did he really approach Heaven, and did he enter Heaven's gate?&#34;  I am puzzled by his &#34;earthworm's view&#34; and &#34;the core&#34; -- terms I have not encountered in any other account of a near death experience.  This leaves me wondering if he was eligible to enter Heaven.  There is no mention of Jesus, who, through Him is the only way to get into Heaven.  In the book &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; the four-year-old boy mentions Jesus throughout his experience and his  experience came across as credible.  &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; fails to convince me that the writer actually &#34;proved&#34; Heaven because his experience fell far short of what I believe Heaven to be, according to Scripture.
B005LAII80|4.0|The movie is pretty good.  The plot is solid and the action is over the top!  The gore level is through the roof on this one.  There is use of slow-mo that is very well done.  It doesn't come off as cliche as to the way it is tied into the plot.  The 3-d is also top notch.  One of the best 3-d experiences I have had this side of Avatar.  The special features are decent, but not amazing.  A fun ride for sure.  The case was a little on the thin/recycled side, so try and keep the hard paper sleeve for storage.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|There is something about this classic film that stands the test of time. Without it there would be no Mean Girls, Easy A or a multitude of teen flicks.<br /><br />The typical five man band plays well together - and who can forget the beautiful soundtrack.
B00008G176|5.0|When I opened my package, it was a nice surprise. The record looked like it had come right out of the record stores from back then, still sealed and untouched. Everything was in perfect condition and I definitely enjoyed my product.
B000003FMY|5.0|The Chicago symphony orchestra is one of the prime orchestras in the world.  This is a good version with a lot of extra music also showcased for a really great price.  Every instrument is clearly heard and the interpretation of the music is generally quite good.  Glad I got it!
B008B68J2G|4.0|I love the set but there are small parts for children for 3 and under.<br />The set is awesome if there were not small parts for young then I would like it better.
1607066017|5.0|After reading many positive reviews I decided to add this to my growing collection. The artwork is stunning and the storyline, although familiar, is still unique enough to grip.<br /><br />An intergalactic war, cats that tell the truth and a floating torso. What else could you want?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really find subway surfers as a very competitive and achieving game because it tries on all concentration and speed and it teaches u to be concentrated when getting away from the guard as the level get more complexes.
B008220C38|4.0|If it hadn't been for the fine acting in this version of Tolstoy's classic tale, the use of the stage as a prop for the whole thing would have defeated it.  But the performance of Kiera Knightly, Jude Law, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as well as a fine supporting cast rescued the film from total debacle.  If you look at it more as a filmed stage play, the use of the stage might be acceptable.  The ending is pretty standard and Vronsky comes off as a cad in this version, but we also see more of Karenin, thanks to the performance of Jude Law, and how the romance of Anna and Vronsky effect Karenin's career.  It is almost as if you need both this version and the Marceau version to get a really rounded look at the story.  And in the study of Karenin, lies the value of this version over all the others that I have watched.
030758836X|3.0|I really liked the beginning of this book. I found that the author had a way of wording things that dug deep into the human condition. Incredibly honest. But as the story continued the charactors began to do a Jekyll and Hyde and I found myself disliking the book more and more. The honesty from the beginning began to be sufficating at some point. I don't like feeling helpless and impotent and that is how I felt. I do think the author is amazing. I'm just not a fan of the places her book takes the reader. I read this for a book club and though most finished it, no one loved it.
B004S3MB2U|1.0|I downloaded this as a free download of the day.  It worked fine that day only.  Now the app says that I am not the owner although it is listed in my purchased apps in the Amazon AppStore.  I read the reviews about onerous DRM with this app but dismissed it as the bad luck of a few.  In the future I'll trust reviews more.<br /><br />Too bad really.  It was a nice app when I was able to use it.  I'm just shocked that companies have still not learned that onerous DRM stifles sales - it's unobtrusive DRM that can help protect and increase sales unlike the DRM NeoCalc seems to be using.  It's only a matter of time until something better comes along without the obtrusive DRM - maybe not even better but just marginally comparative.<br /><br />It has been proven over and over again that customers will tolerate a slightly inferior product over a product with DRM that is obtrusive.<br /><br />Sorry that this is less of a review than a plea to the makers of NeoCalc.  It would be such a shame to see what seemed to be a good product disappear from the market because of something like DRM.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book was terrible. I mean there wasn't a spot where you could look up a word you had to go through the  whole book to find it
B00B2064IY|5.0|I was instantly flashed  back to New Years Eve when I saw the Band of Gypsies live. I also felt I was at the studio with the unadorned takes. Whenever you look at unreleased material you can often taste the groove in the mind of the artist.  Unreleased takes often demonstrate the magic that was captured in the released version. When Hendrix recorded technology was ancient. He created his masterpieces with the most basic equipment.  No racks of gear, no group of techs making everything work and pressing buttons. This was him raw. Hey back in those days you chose your guitar cable based on the tone you wanted at the time (his coiled cord cut highs when he wanted to). Those who can't feel the groove and be transported without making critical evaluations certainly don't like this kind of music. Do you think at lot of modern music years from now will be selling outtakes, and jams/practices? Nope, with all the cut and paste done now and corrections there was never actually nothing to begin with for modern music!  The price for this was a bargain and I am happy to be sitting here at this moment listing to it.  Buy this already.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I loved how this film portrayed how love and being loved can be very scary but with patience and communication those walls can be broken down.  I wish all love was as quirky and beautiful as this film was.
0061692034|3.0|This wasn't an easy book to read, largely because its main theme is the interior life of its main protagonist, Dell Parsons. During the first half of the book, the plot takes second place to the thoughts of this 15 year-old whose parents rob a bank. It's only in the second half that the plot begins to move with more verve. Although the action purportedly takes place in 1961, it has the feel of a much earlier period, like the 30's or 40's. I'm sorry to say that I only got through it by skimming large sections of it. But I'm glad I read it.
1402786360|5.0|Heather has made the standard 'cookbook' into a work of art.  Her recipes are wonderful and creative but it's the photography...how she sets up her food for pics that makes this book more.  She uses vintage as well as contemporary props to accent her beautiful dessert creations.<br /><br />This book makes a wonderful gift for anyone that loves uniquely creative desserts and beautiful photography.
1592407889|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and Sachi did a great job making you feel you were experiencing her joy and pain. My heart went out to her.  I never could understand how Shirley MacLaine could ship her daughter to her father and not have much interaction with her.  What a sad life for both Sachi and her mother not having the bond that daughters and mothers live for and enjoy for a lifetime.  I wonder if Shirley's fame puts a warm glow in her heart in her lonely moments.  I doubt it.  A daughter's love can do that, though.  Another story about how self-centered and self-serving celebrities hurt other people, especially their families -- and mostly, themselves. A very good read.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played and I would recommend this to everyone one I know
B008220C38|2.0|I was so disaapointed with this movie. The distraction comes from the scenes everywhere to make 'all the word's a stage' literally be on the screen. Between the 'look at what we can do with a stage in our movie' and overacting by Keira Knightly (sp), it's just a story of adultery and the sad way it destroys marriages. Like we don't know that already. Everytime I saw a character walk onto a stage or a bunch of clerks beating time on their desks for some idiotic reason, I just had to hit fast forward. The only thing redeeming were the costuming and the one compassionate and honorable man in the movie. It was so memorable, I forgot the guy's name...
B008220DGE|4.0|I'm not completely sure how I feel about this movie.  The acting is fantastic.  Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman were rightful lauded throughout the award season for their performances.  The cinematography works well here, making this movie feel both modern and period specific (in this case the 1950s).  My only real problem with the feel is that I don't understand it completely, but I don't hold that against it.  Paul Thomas Anderson's films have always been a bit oblique to me.  Even if I don't quite get all the messages that the film wants to deliver, I was enthralled throughout, mainly due to those acting performances that anchor the film.<br /><br />The DVD release is good (fantastic picture and audio), but I wish it had more special features.  I liked how the deleted scenes were presented.  Instead of just including the scenes, we get a 20 minute feature that edits together those scenes (including some alternate takes of existing scenes), while dialogue from the movie and music are layered throughout.  I found it to be a good way to present them.  There are also many teasers and trailers for this film included (16+ minutes worth).  Unfortunately there is only a short 8 minute behind the scenes feature, which doesn't go into the film-making process at all.  Instead it is just some footage of some of the sets and then some photos taken during filming.  It is interesting, but I was hoping for some more details on how the story came together or how the movie was shot.  Apparently the Blu-Ray has a 60 minute documentary on how WWII vets were given psychiatric treatments, but unfortunately that wasn't on the DVD.  There is a postcard with Philip Seymour Hoffman's picture on it (or rather, The Master's picture).<br /><br />If I had to rate the movie and DVD on Amazon's scale, I'd give the movie 4 stars out of 5 and the DVD 3 stars out of 5.  I gave it 4 stars overall because the DVD doesn't not diminish the film.
B003L0V758|4.0|I love this album and I find that Janelle suprises me more and more with her talent1  Buy it you wont be sorry!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I finally got around to reading this book after I knew the movie was coming out.  I always like the book better and this read was no exception.  Very thought-provoking and easy to follow.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie before I read the books. Fell in love with the movie, but it doesn't do the books justice. Love the progressions the characters go through. You think you will know what happens next, but you are wrong. Would and have recommend these books to every book lover..
B007BVMVDU|5.0|We love this show.  There are tons of twists and turns that always keep you guessing.  Can't wait for the next one
B00013F38K|5.0|i chose this because i loved it as a child. i recommend it to any viewer at any age. it taught me lessons to use in everyday life.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Cheesy and predictable, but I still enjoyed reading it.  Definitely lighter fair and a typical Nicholas Sparks novel.  Better than the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I flew through it in 2 days.  I liked the characters very much.  The story was very gripping and captured your imagination immediately.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Even better than the first season.  I just wish that season three was out already because I love the characters.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Had fun playing this game had times was frustrated but great fun all in all would recommend to all to play
B00006DEFA|5.0|Blue ray would be the only improvement for this. I love music, and this story. Together it definitely made me happy to order this set.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked it, but was disappointed in the end.  Cannot discuss without giving away the end, but would have liked a different ending.
1451627297|2.0|It was excruciating to read this book, and I found practically nothing interesting, original in the story, in fact, there are too many holes, and non sensical turns that just cannot be materialized in a coherent manner. The writing style is boring and so long, there is no incentive to go on other than the fact that I am usually incapable of giving up on a book.  I have always wanted to read at least one by this prolific author, and I think I probably picked a wrong one.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is addicting. the only issue is that I have read all the books and it takes this guy five years to put one out. I have seen pic's of him he's not fit, what if he drops before finishing? I would go insane!!!!
B00932A6G4|1.0|Didn't care for it, didn't care for it in the least, but then again I thought it was a continuation of the first one.
B000FC1MCS|2.0|Very weird.  I enjoyed it so little I can't even remember how it ended.  It might be good for someone trying to understand autism, but I personally saw no redeeming qualities for me.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very detailed. Has put me on the path to healthy eating and also eliminating chemicals in my daily living. GREAT!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved this book in the beginning! It was the kind of book I couldn't put down. I enjoyed the concept of the story being told from 2 points of view. But after I found out the true character of the wife the story began to drag. I was bored by the end.
B00B7FWWNA|2.0|In my opinion, what is the difference between a surrogate sex therapist and an escort? I don't get it. They both get paid.  Helen hunt was not believable to me and shouldn't of been nominated, just my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  Characters and situations grabbed your attention immediately and didn't let up a second.  Very enjoyable read.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This loose concept album is fantastic. Going from nearly thrash metal to an up beat pop rock song, straight into a doom and gloom metal homage to Black Flag. This album is so fluid and each song invokes a very specific feeling. Light and airy tracks mixed with heavy nearly destructive sounding ones leave you feeling paralyzed and zombiefied! This albums name sake song is probably one of the best rock songs ever written along with a few others from this album; its two secret songs are also a treat...especially song 0 if you download the MP3 versions, an actual song for the deaf!!! 10/10 for this album, nothing is left out, and nothing leaves you feeling disappointing!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Dont waste your money, the pictures are so bad, they are so fuzzy.  Looks like and old camara took the pictures.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|Snugg might be the best case I have tried to this point. Nice and tight from the get go and has staying power.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I've always loved this animated story.  The music and content is great and timeless.  I will purchase this movie for my daughter.
B000001DYA|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this CD, it is great and in perfect condition. I am completely satisfied with my purchase
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey does not disappoint. We all love the series here and hate to miss an episode. By having the season, we catch the ones we missed. It makes for a great weekend marathon!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is great...one I have been waiting to be made for a very long time. I'm glad they waited though the cast is perfect. The sound and picture of this Blu-Ray are as always incredible. I missed the very end got to see it this time. LOL you'll like it. A must have for anyone who loves Marvel Universe, or just a great superhero movie.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Creative cinema display.  At times the movie was a little difficult to follow, but I was able to understand the story line.
B00AEBB8UQ|5.0|Love this movie...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The doctor has been chosen to tell his story so that those who have difficulty getting past what can be seen or touched can believe. I would have wished 4 more descriptions of what he experienced.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|. Love,magic,good and bad what not to like?  5 stars.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is a twilight fan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much!!! It is really realistic and shows great aspects of the real horse world. In a way it teaches you about how to care for your horse which could also help you in real life horse care!! In a way this game teaches you a lot!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is really fun but only works for a little while on my kindle. every kindle User has experienced this for the past couple of months but nothing has been done to correct it. sounds like laziness to me.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Best way to get flash on non flash supporting device, it is a great browser alternative for handheld device. it supports flash and can be installed on any android device, Including amazon kindle's that notoriously do not support flash.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|It was on a list of items personally requested  for a gift.  Item was as described and shipped on time.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I can not get enough of this series. I loose sleep every night because I keep telling myself just one more episode.
1451695195|5.0|The book provided a really unique perspective on the whole...what happens when you die...question.  I normally wouldn't put a lot of credibility into a topic like this but considering the scientific explanation he provides for what happened, I find it hard not to believe it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was excellent and I can't wait to read catching fire she is a amazing writer who made the book real to me
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game so much. I play this more than minecraft pocket edition. I deleted a lot of old games.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I liked Rio but they keep &#34;hooking&#34; you in to BUY more upgrades. You don't have to have to up grades to beat the levels but it makes it a lot easier and faster. I prefer the original Angry Birds where skill rules! Would I recommend it? Probably not.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Have read all of Grisham's work and the only problem I have is he is publishing so seldom.<br />Good story line about the little guy getting back at the &#34;business as usual&#34; authorities.<br />Reading via the Samsung Tablet 10.1 is great, also.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I originally downloaded this for my daughter, now I have taken over. I can't help it, it is addicting! It has a story line and quests to do as well as games to play
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story blew me away!  If you love \\"hard science fiction\\" like I do, you will love this book.<br />I dislike stories that have a plot that could be set in the Stone Age, in Medieval Times, the Wild West or the future.  Sure they have their place but when I want to read Science Fiction I wand to read Science Fiction. I love science fiction stories that could not fit into any other setting.<br />I have been disappointed many times by so called science fiction stories that deal with fantastic, promising settings like for instance orbiting space habitats, or humans trying to settle newly discovered planets.  But they always deteriorate to the common human problems that we are so familiar with, greed, lust for dominance and all the base human emotions and faults.  This is very sad when settling a new planet brings so many challenges by itself.  Humans will pull together on one string to survive.  There is no need for an antagonist in a good survival story.<br /><br />What does it take to survive in an alien possibly hostile environment?  Show some human ingenuity against all odds.<br />This book is all that and more.  The author, I'm sure must at the very least be an active member of the Mars Society [...] if not an engineer or physicist in his own right.  Without pulling out a slide rule all the physics and logic in this book appear to be reasonable and correct.  I never had the impression that something was overlooked or unrealistic.<br /><br />(spoiler alert!)<br /><br />The protagonist, Mark Watney, manages to survive against all odds with the help of his own mind, the NASA crew at JPL and his former ARES 3 crew-mates on the HERMES ship.<br /><br />This is a great read and I am hoping that there is more from this author.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Everything is below the screen and can't even with pinch get it to where you can see to play it
B002ZG997M|5.0|This is my most favorite movie of all time. I must watch it at least once per week. I've had no problems with the DVD.<br />thanks
B00338QENI|5.0|A facinating acccount of how far research was able to go on the cells that began with one woman.  We;; written - hard to put down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|11 yr old grandson playing,  seems to be enjoying, finds it to be minimal challenge, I have not sat down with him to really critique this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Any horse lover will enjoy this game. It is easy, simple, and best of all interactive.<br />Fun game all around.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I'm very happy with this Blu-Ray DVD. I've watch it a few times with my grandaughter.<br />We have used the 3-d glasses with are way kool.<br />Thanks
B008GB2ALW|5.0|One of the best overall books for teaching repetition and colors to children. Predictable books are great for young children. They love this book! Also, this version with the slider is great for interaction.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just a quick pick for free play.  I enjoy it when I want to sit down and not have to think too hard but keep the mind occupied.  Grson was trying to make the game harder than it is, I had to laugh at him when I showed him a few of the games he could not complete. Ohhhhh, grandma showing him how to play a computer game,  awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Basically the game overall is great. There really isn't anything that I can say you haven't thought of. And I love he graphics as well!!! A very fun play!
B008I34ZFW|1.0|I bought this movie based on the independence day meets inglorious bastards tagline.<br />It is one of the worst, pointless movies I have ever seen.<br />You will have more fun watching paint dry.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I wanted to love this. Seriously. I love Lauren Oliver's writing. Such talent. I didn't understand why we needed Hana's POV if I'm being honest. I don't think it added anything critical to this story. And I felt there were several missed opportunities for tension and character development in this. I didn't care for the end either. I wanted so badly to love this. I just didn't.<br /><br />I love this series but I'm left disappointed. I have flashbacks of MOCKINGJAY disappointment. WHY? I think this needed a couple chapters added to the end, then I would have felt satisfied, at least.<br /><br />However. Oliver's writing is beyond beautiful, so having said all that, it was still a decent read ;0)
B0053O89WY|5.0|As always, Big Bang Theory came through with episodes that are funny and keep you in your chair, glued to the 'tube'!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all three of these books in like ten days, they are all I thought about. Very well written, now I'm gonna find more books that Suzanne wrote.
0143034901|4.0|Although not an exciting page-turner, there is something interesting on every page, and I do mean on every page. I'm currently half-way through the book and I'm enjoying the plot and all the characters. I think  the books moves a little slowly for my personal tastes, but it's filled with atmosphere and is always surprising.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|This book is really for someone who is more techno-oriented than I  but I did like the story.  Had to slog thru some of it, not his best read but ok
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This had a slow start. Then I was intrigued, and then confused. But I kept with it. There were some twists that one wouldn't expect.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very high tech calculator that is very easy to use. Love it!!!  Digitally,LLC did a great job creating this app. I highly recommend this app.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This is my third negative scanner.  The other two were given to me and each had flaws.  This scanner is nearly perfect.  The quality of the pictures is very good (as good as the negative you start with).  It is easy to use and you do not have to be connected to the computer.  It will save directly to an SD card, but you are able to see what you are saving with the preview screen.  It is fairly quick to use as well.  My only complaint is that I wish I had more time to use it :)
B003VANOFY|2.0|The sound in it is great and the feature to lift the mic to mute is great.<br />However the headphones are completely unusable because they disconnect every 2-5 minutes.<br />I've tried removing all other wireless devices out of my office and turning off my wifi router but still they keep disconnecting. I'm also just sitting about a foot away from the transmitter.<br /><br />I also had a problem with the software. Randomly it would put the voice morph on, making business calls very embarrassing.<br /><br />If you want to go wireless, I do not recommend these.
0062238868|5.0|A great read of an American hero...A true patriotic hero who loved his Country!  An easy read that flows nicely, and the Author allows you into his life as a SEAL, husband and father.
B001KL3GZO|5.0|Some critics have said that this is the best Jazz Album ever made.<br />I'm not sure about that, but it is most definitely in the top-10 in my collection.<br />It is both a ground braking and (now) a legendary recording.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Completed this book in one rainy day. So many things happen to the main character in such a short amount of time your head kind of spins. Then once you've become accustomed to the pace and a few typographical errors, it ends. What should've been the next chapter is now the next book. However much I liked this one in particular I believe I'll wait for the entire series to finish before continuing on.
6305910324|5.0|This is pretty good chess movie. I liked it when I had seen it several years ago. I purchased it for my grandson who is eight and learning to play chess.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story was fast paced, very hard to put down. I liked the ending, it was fitting...Satisfying! This is one of those series I will read again.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved the story line. In my opinion the book was way better than the movie. The book was well written.
0345404475|1.0|I read some reviews that said this was not the Philip Dick book.  It certainly reads like a Dick book. If this was a rewrite of Dick's book, I am frankly amazed.  While Dick's ideas are good, he does a poor job of bringing them to fruition.  I grew up on Dick's movie adaptations.  The movies have always been much better than the actual books.<br /><br />I picked this up at the library hoping this was the actual Blade Runner.  Sadly, it was not.  It was clearly, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\".  It reads like it was written for the mentally ill searching for their inner self.  Strange and awkward wording was one of the many lowlights of this audiobook.<br /><br />This book was more a diatribe on religion, Mercerism.  On and on it went about Mercerism and the empathy box.  Deckard speaks to Mercer.  Deckard becomes Mercer.  I really wanted to take Buster Friendlily and Mercer and shove them in a dark orifice.<br /><br />I realize there are many who believe these books have deeper meaning, and they should be discussed in an intellectual manner.  Honestly, I find more meaning in the \\"Three Little Pigs\\".  Intellectually, I question why anyone would to read this more than once, much less discuss it.<br /><br />It is old and just bad.  Rent Blade Runner and forget this.
B000W292FA|5.0|Excellent and under rated compilation by the more creative part of TFF.  20 years after its release I still listen to this album frequently.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Thank you so very, very much!<br /><br />I LOVE this movie, and so does my son now!<br /><br />Highly recommend to EVERYONE!
B008RTE09S|5.0|In December 1967,on Boxing Day (The U.K.'s Christmas Day,BTW) This Special was shown,along with their \\"Top Of the Pops\\" Video \\"Hello,Goodbye\\" after Petula Clark's special,but only in Black And White...A Bonus \\"Making Of\\" tells the disasterous results! And there's 4 \\"Easter Eggs\\" hidden in the menu,two in the lower \\"Shooting Stars\\" two more on the Multi-Coloured Bumper at either end of the Main Menu..the transfer of this 1967 classic is startling and Beautiful! Scratch and Blemish Free this is,by far,the best ever version of this,in both sound and picture quality! I Highly recommend this! A Real Treasure!
B003G4W49C|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this but had a hard time believing a 6 year old capable of doing and thinking the way he did. It is one thing to be smart, but another to be emotionally mature and able to come up with ways to deal with the stress he experienced.  i've been around 6 year olds. Ain't no way. Even the smart ones. I am going to read on in the series because the story itself was great.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This was such a terrific movie!<br /><br />Great classic treasure to have.  I enjoy watching this with my son!<br /><br />Thanks so very much!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|It is flawed in Europeans thinking the US cares what they think, even having the president attend what I think is the security council or an expanded NATO.  It is good in the President caring more about grandstanding than actually doing anything, though.  At least it does not have Norway leading the west though.:)<br />Looking past its unavoidable flaws it is well executed and the production values are good.
B00BOL126U|5.0|This show had my attention all 45minutes. Action packed and seems like a few surprises are coming. CHECK THIS OUT!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I am so happy to be able to let my son view and enjoy this wonderful classic!<br /><br />Thanks very much!
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Beautiful looking movie. Action packed through the entire film. However they left out the meat of the story. Enjoy it for what it is, a popcorn movie with a fun take on one of our greatest historical figures.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this camera bag! Its awesome,i love that it has so many pockets and it holds everything i need!!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Thank you so very much!<br /><br />Thrilled to own a Disney classic such as this!  Wonderful for young and old alike!
B009JBZH54|3.0|Movies are nice. Comes with an abbreviated version of the coffee table book they want you to buy. For the price of all three in one package you really can't do any better. The discs are kind of jam packed on top of each other instead of having their own section in the foldable package. It would have been nice for each movie to have their own case.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham had my full attention after page one. That is a very high compliment as I often have a difficult time adjusting to a new book.<br /><br />The racketeer has a great plot, is fast moving, and keeps you guessing till. A great holiday read.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Thank you so very much!<br /><br />I LOVE this cute and musical classic, and I'm so happy I can enjoy it with my son!<br /><br />GREAT in every way!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love the packaging, not as nice as the first season but still attractive. Most importantly I was able to use the digital copy for my itunes account, the ultraviolet, and there was a free purchase for the Amazon Instant Video for the entire season two. Considering you get the Blue-ray and DVD on top of that this is such a great value for the $49.99 I spent. Fantastic purchase if you are a fan of the show. Looks gorgeous on a high quality tv as to be expected.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Although I have read many books about the SEALs and enjoy reading about them, I was a little hesitant to read this book since there were so many negative reviews.  All I can say is that I am glad that I did not trust all the bad reviews.  I did not want to put his book down and finished it in three days.<br /><br />Chris was very upfront and personal in his book.  It's amazing what our troops sacrifice for our country and do to fight for our freedom.  If you enjoy reading about the SEALs, their missions, and would like to get an insight into the personal sacrifices these elite warriors make, you should definitely read this book.<br /><br />RIP Chris Kyle.
0805028846|5.0|The book is amazing, phantastic ideas, not too complicated to do oneself....I tried one straight away...<br />and it arrived much quicker than expected
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|The extra features are wonderful. The postcards are gorgeous. Mine did not come with the digital copy card and a quick email took care of that. The response time was super fast. Not to forget just how beautiful the movie is, and fun the story is. Super happy with this purchase. The vignette on how they made the sets is a must watch.
B00009NQQO|3.0|My son loves anything to do with a ball, so I ordered this for him when he was just about a year old. He enjoyed them in the tub and totally understood making baskets, which was great. I used super glue to cover the holes on the balls, so they couldn't fill with water and get mildewy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the basket doesn't stick very well, no matter what we do. For the price, I didn't expect it to be perfect, so I'm ok with what we got.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|If i was you , I would not waste my money or time on this movie. I watched 40 minutes of it and could bare no more. Very disappointed.
B0006J28BO|4.0|for some reason there were a lot of skips and freezes even though I saw no scratch's  who knows why
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game!  It is fun, takes a short time and is colorful.  The cube is able to accessed from any direction.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|like  everybody  else  im  a  very  bad  twilight  fan  im  making  a  twilight  room  this  will  go  fine  with  my  decore  thank  you
B0001L3LUE|5.0|You have to watch this interview if you even have a passing interest in our political times.  I watch it about once a year, it helps with my perspective.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I was adjusting to yet another actor playing 007, and I was looking forward to watching this after I missed it at the theatre. I was disappointed, but glad I didn't run the expense of going out to see it. I would say more, but it would involve totally spoiling the plot.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game has some nice differences from other games. No, I'm not going to tell you what they are. However, not the best I have ever played. More hidden objects than puzzles, which is a plus to me.Very nice music.  Certainly worth upgrading from free.<br />Update: After finishing the game, I really like the ending and hope to find more like this game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!  I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and have read the majority of all of his books but this one was different.  I couldn't put this one down.  I grew to love Katie and Alex and the kids.  While the plot is similar in that guy meets girl, girl and guy fall for each other and they lived happily ever after, this one seemed to have more to the plot.  With the added mystery as to who Katie really is and why she was trying to run away from her past, the plot thickens when you find out about the domestic abuse that she suffered.  I was thoroughly impressed with how Alex handled the situation that he was thrown into and that he still loved her at the end even after his world kind of crumbled!  Great read and a fast one as well!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|So,I was listening to time by Benny bennassi,it was all like &quot;time is what you need.&quot; You know what? The song WAS right.you need more time on the demo.every time it would end,I'd just start another world.
B002RV01QI|5.0|EASY LISTENING MUSIC.  I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED ENYA.  SHE HAS A GREAT STYLE AND EASE OF BLENDING THE LYRICS AND THE INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER TO PRODUCE A WONDERFUL CD.  CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE.
0823095223|4.0|It´s really nice book. Full of explanations about how to create your action figure.Highly recommended to professionals and begginers. Amazing.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I was blown away by both Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackmans performances. It's emotional and raw which definitely did the musical justice.
B004GJXQ20|3.0|I tried. Really tried. However, the action is dragging and dragging and dragging. And the book kept on jumping and jumping and... (you get it) from place to place and from character to character. The jumps were chronologically accurate but the transition was superficial; a bit like ''cut-and-paste-and-forgot-to-check-it''.  I understand that there are lots of characters in the book and the plot is complicated but I found myself skipping pages in hope of finding a place where, finally, it was going to hold onto the story. Nope. Not a chance.<br />If you are really into medieval stories populated with mythical creatures have a go.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Talk about a thriller?!?!? Not only was the story well written, but it keeps you guessing. Definitely a must read.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really loved the Twilight series. A lot of people try to compare Twilight, Harry Potter and Hunger Games, but you cannot. They are all great in their OWN ways. Twilight is a great story if you're looking for something quick, easy and interesting. It is above all a love story and a great read.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|love this movie great will be  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
0740785508|5.0|An inspirational book with pages and pages of ideas, techniques, and tips and I'm off to find my paints right now...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a fun game and my kids like it a lot too. good graphics. good game for horse lovers for sure
0740797719|5.0|I'm an art student and this book is so much more helpful than just a &#34;how to paint&#34; book. I found the information and examples and tips incredibly helpful. I'd suggest this book for anyone learning to draw or paint.
0062238868|5.0|An amazing life and such a tragic end.  Now reading Last Stand of Fox Company.<br /><br />  Ex  WWII Navy CPOH  USS Boxer CV21  1945-46
B009JBZH54|5.0|To be honest, all ready had the first 2 movies but wanted the new one and this was cheaper then the individual movie when I got it.
B008R65Y28|5.0|Johnny Depp is definitely Hollywoods leading man at best. Currently he has shown complete versitility with the roles he is playing. Although the extreme eccentric is what he plays best. This grouping of movies shows his talent over the large span of his poularity. All three movies are definite must's  for any Johhny Depp collection.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I find that artists music often gets worse over time; but not the great ones.  I feel that Mraz has gotten better each album.  Can't wait to see him live.
B00571F26Y|4.0|But some interesting additional information about modern wheat. Definitely adds to the conversation along with Lustig and others sounding the high carb/processed food alarm.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Downloaded on my Kindle, worked for awhile, then went south.  Wouldn't reconnect, didn't recognize my logon and wouldn't let me download again because I had an account but wouldn't let me open it.  Too much drama, I gave up.
8866130915|3.0|Pro's: Fits well in a purse or bag, forces you to not write too much info in a daily planner<br />Cons: Small size means it may not be useful for those of you who wish to write more detailed notes
B0058X67OM|5.0|I gave this as a Gift to a Fellow Musician Friend. He has confirmed he 'really' likes it. I will eventually purchase it for myself as well. I had their Manticore Boxed Set in the past, and really loved it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|interesting game to play if u want to be stragetic.  Always thinking of a way to increase income. it can be difficult but in other sense, it is a great game to play.
B00ABO573A|1.0|Decided to watch this movie because of the awards it had won and the 3 & 1/2 stars it had at the time. What a mistake! This is almost 2 hrs of torture! For a Gay Movie released in 2012, it tells the same boring gay melancholic cliche story told so many times in the 80's and 90's, nothing new here. Gay life and gay culture is so much more than this. The best parts of the movie are seen in the trailer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You should totaly get this app! It's awesome! Better than the 1st temple run! You should get this app! I give it a five star! And a thumbs up! You NEED to get this app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool. I like working up in levels and making it more like my very own. Very cool game!  If only the ads would stop popping up it would be rated even higher!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Surprisingly fun to read.  Now I understand the explosive behavior in the kitchens on Food Network tv.  I also understand why I got so sick eating oysters from that Mother's Day Sunday brunch last may!  I really enjoyed the book and Tony's candor.
0345803485|1.0|What more can I say.  I don't usually write reviews, but this book was so horrible I had to comment.  Poor writing, predictable plot.  I thought I might lose it if I had to read \\"holy crap,\\" holy sh--\\" or \\"holy f---\\" one more time.  Sad to see that trash like this can make it to the best seller list.
B00160FBWK|5.0|this one is the best out of the Alien franchise, I'm more of a Predator fan. I got this a few days before the Alien Colonial Marine game came out, to get myself ready to kill some Aliens.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I've seen this group on different shows.  I thought I'd really like their music.  I love their name.  Maybe it'll grow on me.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|I wasn't really sure about this at first, I'm not a fan of remakes. But I am glad i gave it a shot.  Kate Beckinsale is HOTT as a crazy chick.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this app!  It changes with each win so it doesn't get too boring.  I would highly recommend it.  It has always been a favoriteof mine and now on my Kindle Fire I can take it whereever I go.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I seen all of the individuals movies beside the Hulk, to me the Hulk will always be Lou Ferrigno. The script was solid, great character chemistry, and lots of action.

B003GXJ072|5.0|It's a good monster movie, the 2nd one was better, this is the 2nd best out of the Alien movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I always play it when I'm bored but the only problem is the prices to buy a character. Is too much please make the prices go down thanks any comments please comment back
B001QC6QRC|5.0|You got TMNT and The Ice Man what more do you need to know. Yes it's not as &#34;dark&#34; as the first one, but that is thanks to parents complying about too much violence.
B005N7CA3A|5.0|I love it. The music is more mature and &#34;sophisticated&#34;, upgrading the already enjoyable experience of listening to his voice!
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|Great,Great album you wont regret this purchase songs are terrific and unforgettable simply a must for Floyd collectors<br />to buy!<br />.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I read it for a book grp and though i liked it I didn't love it. I liked the part of the jfk , but could never wrap my head aroind the fact that there were jump rope girl and the portal. I myself unlike others was disappointed in the ending. I was hoping they would be together forver/ Also I felt lee Harvey oswald was portayed as a human being, with faults and all. The time travel bothered me with the porthoeles. I did like it however, but I will agree with a book clubber who said it seemed like 2 different stories.
B0053FANS6|5.0|The colors in these movies really jump out at you and come to life. made it so much more enjoyable than the originals could ever be a great buy for the $$$
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever invented I love how there is now an egg hunt because it gives you something to work for best game ever yay -written bye an 12 yr old
B007REV4YI|5.0|You be the judge but i personally like the new Bond Series better than the previous ones.<br />There is more Action and Suspense rolled up in this movie than most! just a great film on blue ray disk!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Knowing his history really helps give more meaning to Manson's lyrics. Both entertaining and enlightening. \\"Five more words required\\" Read it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie was such a wonderful surprise. From the directing to the editing to the acting to the screenplay, this team just made all the right decisions. &#34;Charlie&#34; is instantly lovable and relatable, and Emma Watson is very natural and committed to this role. Immediately you forget that it's her playing the role - you just see Sam. The supporting roles are also great. In terms of its portrayal of teenage angst, loneliness and eventual acceptance, this movie is as beloved to me as the classic Harold and Maude.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and could not stop reading until the end! Fantastic cliffhanger that will leave you dying to get your hands on the next book!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Awesome movie. One of the best of all time. Had lost my copy, thanks for the new one amazon. Boom.
098478280X|5.0|First and foremost, this book tends to prepare you for a very generalistic role in Software Engineering. You will need a more specific book if you are interviewing for a more specific role. Even so, this book cleaned out many cobwebs and elightened me on some coding concepts that I may have overlooked.<br /><br />I've been studying with it for about 3 weeks now and it seems to be working.<br /><br />Well... I still haven't cracked the interview -- in fact I also haven't finished the book, nor finished the interviewing process. However, thus far the book has helped me considerably. The chapters that I did review and the programming questions that I did try were very challenging and suprisingly effective brain boosters.<br /><br />Even more relevent -- the parts of the book that I have not yet read were the some of the very questions that caused me trouble in my latest phone interview. Thus, I can plainly see that if I continue to study this book, it will be rewarding.
B006HL9G10|1.0|I wish the developer would explain the permissions the app requires. I am always concerned when an application wants to access the internet at any time. The application may be very good but the rating is based on permissions only.
B008476HBM|5.0|This novel embodies the best of Jane Austen, Wit, insight, charm and romance are all packed into this story of two people who find each other despite their bad first impression.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|a little over the top - too much violence, not enough love.  Bad idea to kill M, she was too important
B007D5E7C2|3.0|Kill Bill 1 makes no sense without Kill Bill 2. Only together they make an OK movie. Recommended for all Tarantino fans since his signature is practically on all the scenes. Action Packed. Thurman is great too ))
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I would play it all day every day if I could ot is so addictive as soon as you play it you will be hooked<br />  have fun playing<br />  and happy subway surfing
B00005JMUA|3.0|Kill Bill 1 and 2 go hand in hand. it is more like 1 movie and not 2. therefore recommended for all who watched 1 and had regrets.<br />The acting: 4/5 Much better than 1<br />the scenes: 3/5<br />costumes: 3/5<br />the script: 4/5<br />Music: 3/5<br />Very recommended after watching Kill Bill 1.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She chose peeta!!! I love it!!!!!they had kids,but I would sooooo miss Gale!!!!I wish there was another book!! I LOVE KATNISS!!!!!#
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think this is probably one of the best action games out there right now.  Love the fact you can conquer level after level, begin again and still move forward with new challenges. Not bored with this game at all.
B0000844M8|5.0|Making a movie based on a real life event is always a challenge,it gets even tougher when you want to make a movie with wild animals like Lion and this entire cast and crew have exceedingly succeeded in their efforts.Hats off to the legendary team,you have done one heck of a job.<br /><br />This is definitely a heart-touching,close to soul story which will remain in the minds of viewers for long time.Definite watch for animal lovers,kids and even for the general audience.Completely breaks all the stereotypes we have in our mind for wild animals.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|I wish I never read this series!!! I thought stories were supposed to have endings. I can't believe I wasted my time on this book. I'm just so disappointed.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Sad story line but by far a incredible awesome movie, love that it is in blue-ray, the only better viewing would be in 3D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this game because it was free and it truely is free and fun I love it its a lot of fun and your able to earn free stuff its so easy a cave man can do it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just keeps me uplifted spiritually.The reading plans are the best and i get to choose topically too. I also love the fact that i can choose whatever version i like of the bible
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|I love this download.  The entire album is wonderful. I first heard about them on NPR and was intrigued and had to buy it.  Very chill, smooth and airy sound.  There isnt a whole lot of change of tempo throughout the cd -it is slow, which I like.  Buy it!
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|At TheBIZRoom dot com I teach my students how to create systems that generate passive income online but recommend They read this book first because you must have a millionaire mindset in order to believe in yourself.<br />Tim Town
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|The main character Kevin Spacey is the Alley McBeal of congress.  The fact that he faces the camera and supposedly gives the audience an inside view of what's happening detracts from the show.  I'm not sure if this is a comedy or a drama.  The casting is all wrong and Kevin Spacey  with a southern drawl is not believable.  The character Claire is predictable and emotionless.  Compared to regular TV this is not a bad show.  But since most people that have Netflix also have HBO or Cinamax, I would much rather spend my time watching Game of Thrones or Banshee.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|At 58 years old and having a pretty wide variety of classic rock cd's and not really impressed with much of today's new music. I was pretty excited to be able to have an opportunity to purchase a cd from such an icon from the past. This cd is awesome the sound is great and every song is great. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone interested in some good old true blue rock and roll.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book. Definitely Funny and entertaining, but serious at the same time. It will make you have a strange empathy for those who suffer from mental illness.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|There are some really great adult comic subtleties in this movie that kept me asking whether I'd really seen what I saw. I went to see this at the theater the first time and am really looking forward to watching it at home again at my leisure.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|So after waiting 2 hours for it to download its 673 megabytes of  data, it does absolutely nothing.  It closes as soon as I press play.  No error message, no nothing.  It would've been nice if it did some kind of test before it wasted my time with that monster download.
B001FB563E|5.0|I really liked this movie despite the overall doom and gloom. It keeps you engaged and the performances were excellent.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have the free version and I love it. I can make my own sound mixes for relaxing or going to sleep. This even seems to calm my dogs down, or at least makes it so that outside noise is blocked out. They do not bark as much at night when this is on.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have three boys and very little time for myself.  Jillian's 20 minute workouts are perfect for getting in a full body workout in minimal time.  Just make sure to wear a good sports bra as there is a lot of jumping.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I had read about the supposed online sale of one of the boxes even before this movie came out. I was interested due to that.<br />The movie is not an award winner but it is good creepy fun.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Xlnt Music - Xlnt Vendor! All Aspects of Purchase in Perfect Order, would definitely do business with this vendor again

B005LAII8K|2.0|II didnt get it. I get the film and what they were trying to do, but why it got so much praise is beyond me. It completly was not what i expected. It started out good, but then it just got wack. And sadly this happened for me when Bruce Willis showed up. And i was waitiing for him because i thought their would be some explosive gun battles between him and JGL. Oh and this freakin kid. I dont see what all the talk is about him. I actually thought this movie would introduce the power and awe of this kid but not at all. Anyway, the movie is just over complex for no reason. And then its like \\"oh yeah in the year 2044 people have telekinetic powers\\". And then the kid is not even a tk he is freakin damien. Everyone one else can only flot quarters while this kid can make bodies explode.<br />I only gave it two stars because at times it was cute the way JGL did capture a young Bruce. Other than that total, total dissapointment.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing!!  I love to complete the missions to get a higher multiplier!!  This game is so cool!!!!!
0525478817|5.0|I love John Green, I have actually been folowing him and Hank on vlogbrothers when they had just started it with brotherhood 2.0. It was a great read, and quick shipping! I was bummed out because I was supposed to get an autographed copy and didnt but when I emailed they about it they were so considerate!! I was sent a autographed piece of paper from him, what an awesome gesture! This book is definitely a read most teens should read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched all three seasons.  All are exceptional.  The acting, writing, directing, and all aspects of the production are superb.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Love the series bought them all lots of action, adventure, and it's funny at times too. I love the magic.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Having the Linked In app accessible on my Kindle Fire is so convenient.<br />And it cose me NOTHING.<br />How great is that?!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|My son loved playing the game until it crashed on his kindle.  He still can nit get into it and is miserable now.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I BROKE THE HANDLE OF THE ONE I'VE HAD FOR OVER 5 YEARS.  I LOVE IT AND AM GLAD I COULD ORDER IT.  I MISSED IT!!
B006HL9G10|4.0|The tones are pleasant, the ability to customize is excellent and the social sharing feels embracing. A very nice companion.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Judging from similar books that I have read, I think you get a more realistic view of what war is like and how the men respond to it.  The wife's comments added an interesting perspective through out the book.  I am the wife in this comment and there were comments that I didn't appreciate in the book even though I understand that this is how the guys talk.  And I also know that such talk occurs more under stress.  I thought the author painted a pretty grim picture of himself, such as his priorities being a little off base for a guy with a family.<br /><br />I read with some degree of sadness, knowing that he had been murdered just when his life seem to be going well as a civilian.  And I have great sympathy for his wife and children.<br /><br />It is not possible for me to say I enjoyed the book but it is a compelling read.
B004ZJZQ5G|4.0|I, like most P&P fans, judge all movies against the iconic BBC miniseries.  (Colin Firth will always be Mr. Darcy!)  That being said, this movie is a wonderful, much shorter, alternative.  Keira Knightly is a believable Elizabeth Bennett and Matthew Macfayden is a solid Mr. Darcy.  The film itself is beautifully set and the score is phenomenal.  There are places where it deviates from the book, either to move the story along or make it more palatable for a broader audience...some of these are okay and some are not as okay, but overall it FEELS like P&P to me.  The worse part of the movie is the ending added for the American audience...its overly sappy and not at all in the spirit of Jane Austen.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great sequel to Beautiful Creatures...the authors delve deep into the underworld , develop deeper character backstories and open up new storylines. I enjoyed it --especially the end. Looking forward to no. 3!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out many, many years ago.  Its funny, sincere and a visual masterpiece.  The Blu-ray was just as good as the originial!
B0042H9YMC|1.0|This movie is remarkably HORRIBLE.  The story is Pocahantas and the \\"special effects\\" are pathetic beyond all belief.  As a matter of fact when it comes to the \\"special effects\\" they look so horrible that they look just like animation.  As in cartoon.  As in I did not know I was going to watch \\"The Song Of The South\\".  This is a total scam.  THESE ARE NOT GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!  EVERYTHING LOOKS FAKE!!!  And yes I saw it in a really splendid theater with 3-D.  Still a failure of epic proportions.  Its is also an environmentalist film which is total b.s.  Read a book.  This is for the illiterate.  It is also propaganda for bashing people who serve in the military.  I dispise this film and everything that it stands for.  At the end of the day it will be you all's loss...NEGATIVE STARS not just zero because of the downright corrrupt manipulation of the viewers and consumers/customers.
B0041VXGRS|5.0|This book is great for beginner in baking it has very detailed information, and all items seem fairly easy to create.
0062082353|5.0|I thought it kind of shallow, but he said it brought home some of the extremely difficult situations the fighting men were facing.  I thought it could have been longer, with more in depth scenes and conversations between the characters, especially the wife.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|Started with the free version, bought this one. Beat it before church got out. It's fun, but it doesn't last as long as I would like.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|I love the Silent Hill movies and this is an awesome movie! A wonderful conclusion to a great movie. I've only ever watched the first movie before getting this, I've never played the games. I love the movies,and this is a movie to watch if you liked Silent Hill!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|she read a book about this dog. Since there was a movie out . This movie is heart warming show.<br />Great for kids and family.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I love love love the Silent Hill movie. However, the way I received it, I didn't like. The case was broken up a bit, with evidence that there had been attempts to cut it open. I was supposed to receive it brand new, but the case looked used, or at the very least vandalized badly.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|This was a boring movie. I didn't bother to watch the whole thing because nothing interesting was happening. At least it was free!
B005LAIIA8|4.0|Anybody who has lost an animal has thought of bringing their lost dog back .<br />to life. The movie brought tears to my eyes when Sparky went out for the ball and did not come back !<br />I think I saw my former music teacher subsitute as a science teacher oh well to that !Made me wanna<br />get out my jumper cables and dig up my lost pet!
B004USRKX8|5.0|When I listen to this album all of my senses travel back to the good old days.I smell incense and taste rice and vegetables and the cheap wine of my youth.Always a favorite!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are very crisp never blurry. The game is very simple and easy to play  my three year old loves horses and so of course she loves to play this game and its not too complicated for her to play by herself.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is a thrilling story about a family working with the court system to defend their son, Jacob, who has been accused of murder. Emotions run strong as the reader hears the story from the view of Jacob’s father, who is strongly convinced that his son is not guilty. Though the story felt slow getting started in the beginning few chapters, this story quickly built up to an intense conclusion that is nothing to be expected. I felt myself diagnosing the characters, rationalizing their thoughts and actions while climbing inside their minds.<br /><br />I was drawn into this book and enjoyed every minute of it! Thought provoking and arranged in a clever sequence of events, Defending Jacob is a worthwhile read. I challenge the reader to predict the ending; now knowing that the twists and quick changes in perspective leave the reader feeling led through a surprising mind game. How aware are parents of their children’s motives? To what extent would you protect your own child? Are your own actions, as a parent, right or wrong?
B005DJGMQE|3.0|This movie was good overall, but very slow moving - almost quit watching but 2/3 of the way it started moving glad we stuck with it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say it was one of the most touching love stories I have ever read. On every level! I highly recommend this read!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is great. Finished it in a day. Couldn't put it down. Characters so well described, you picture all the scenes. Fantastic.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great product and I consider trading with this vendor a good experience. I'd gladly trade with them agian!

B0042MDAL8|5.0|Love this movie have it on DVD but needed a up grade for my hd 3d tv and it looks amazing!!!
B003B02O14|3.0|Not one if Grisham's best but I would rate it a good three stars. Disappointing ending. Dragged in parts, but still a good read.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I can't understand why sometimes Hollywood will take a great book and screw it up so badly.  The book was both extremely interesting and exciting, but the movie plot is poorly developed and much, much more unbelieveable.  I'm sorry I ever watched this video and will certainly never watch it again.  The acting and special effects aren't particularly good either.  About the only actor in the film I did like was Max Theriot as the the younger version of the hero and hope to see him again in something better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am happy that this was produced because my son love's this app. I just got it for him yesterday and its all he play's now.
B00005JKED|4.0|My bargain-rack movie for last knight was the \\"Training Day\\" DVD staring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. It was a police force drama out of south Los Angeles. Hawke played a newbie cop transfered into an under-cover, free-lance unit manned by Washington and his associates. Washington was not a likeable partner and the opening training day got off to a rough start, which was exactly what Washington intended. Intimidation was the name of the game. When the intimidation got down to performing acts that were downright illegal, all in the name of fighting crime and putting criminals away in one manner or another, Hawke began to resist. The resistance led  to an outright  confrontation between about a half dozen so-called cops and brutal  violence ensued. It was not  a pretty story, nor was it particularly interesting.<br /><br />The action was brisk, the filming was good, the acting was good and the story moved right along. The movie was full of weirdo creeps which kept things somewhat interesting but couldn't gloss over the highly improbable story. I started wondering when the drawn-out drama would ever end. Well, end it did. A real tough training day.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|first of all this game is worth every penny.i have been playing for a while and just found out they added another map! also this game is 3D just like the game for the computer,so you dont have to worry about it being a scam. this is a great and fantastic game
B001NZU7GI|2.0|I hate to be the guy who writes the negative review but i found this record to be a righteous drag.<br />To be sure the band is a Swiss watch and Clapton is playing his ass off. I can see why Clapton said that Jim Gordon was the best drummer he ever played with, wonderful uncluttered style and I like Whitlocks voice with Eric's. The problem I have is these songs go on forever. I get the idea of jamming so don't start piling on. The problem is they go on forever and don't really develop. The opening song \\"Got to get better in a little while\\" just goes on and on, it could have ended after 6 minutes and said everything it did in the 14 minutes this thing tracked and unfortunately most of them seem to do the same thing. Keys to the Highway was kept to a relatively short 6 minutes and was all the better for it. The Layla album is one of the 10 best records of all time. Great playing here but just to much drugs and self indulgence and they didn't know when to quit.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because there are 2 more books to read. Totally enjoyed it. Great page turner. I have 3 grown daughters to whom I will insist they read this.
B00846F1YW|4.0|A solid good game much like the typical hidden object games before it. Nothing new but nothing to complain about.
1400063515|5.0|This is a challenging but rewarding book.  Admittedly, I listened to the audio book, but I did so twice (sorry, my entertainment options were limited while deployed to Afghanistan).<br />If you are intellectually curious and a realist--more interested in why the world is the way it is vice the way it should be--I highly recommend this book.<br />The explanations can be a bit tedious, but it is nevertheless entertaining and an eye-opening look at risk and risk mitigation.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved the series, and I still do. The first two books were amazingly well written. The first book, I thought, was an awesome opener, the second book filled me with suspense and several other emotions I don't know the name of.<br /><br />The third book ... I don't know what to say.<br /><br />Well, actually I do, and here's what I DO have to say:<br /><br />Lauren Oliver, I respect you. I love your writing style, your characters, everything. But when you end a book like this, so vaguely, so emptily, with so many blank spaces ... it hurts us. It really does. It hurt me badly. No book should end like this, not even one with good writing to make up for it. Requiem ended TERRIBLY. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-Y. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. Not want, but NEED. What happens to Hana? What happens to the society? To the Invalids? To the Cureds? What happens to Julian? To ALEX SHEATHES???? TO LENA HALOWAY??????<br /><br />On another note, I feel like I know who Lena ended up with: Alex. It ended in such a way that the choice (almost) seemed clear to me. They confessed their love for each other, and while it might not have been the GUSHIEST moment, I appreciated it all the same. It was the little \\"awww\\" I needed. I personally disliked Julian from the start. I could tell where Oliver was going with this, making a love triangle, and then Alex appearing at the end of Pandemonium was just ... UGH! Anyway, in my mind, she chose Alex. That's all.<br /><br />Read at your own risk. I did.
1849163863|4.0|I love a good mystery. Though this was a good read, it did not live up to my expectations so I don't think I will continue with the rest of this trilogy.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is very useful, it is pretty true to my local weather station.  There are even twitter feeds for locals expressing there opinions about what else? the weather!  If my TV antennae isn't working right, I can turn this on & wala I've got the weather
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I have just finished the first chapter, but so far so good. The HO's are pretty well done so as to be a bit of a challenge to find for certain ones.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent! Once I started this book, I was unable to put it down. Highly recommend! Great read that kept you engrossed the whole time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Suggested read for our book club discussion.  Love the characters and the story line.  Switching from past to present and back again keeps it a page turner!
0446585041|5.0|This book is like a personal chat with Ellen. It is fun and full of joy. I passed it on to my daughter and mother. Our family loves to watch Ellen's TV show daily and I see this book as an Ellen &#34;extension&#34;. It is worth your time and your &#34;dime&#34;. You cannot go wrong with this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it and everyone else would too if they weren't to poor and could not because they had no money<br />lolol
0440238609|5.0|Mandatory reading for any fantasy fan! Lyra and her adventures are just awesome, and are comparable to Chronicles of Narnia itself!
B00BESCJII|5.0|This movie is for all ages.  Seems like it might be a kids movie but it is not.  Excellent story and acting
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is a great calculator to have on my phone. Leaps and bounds ahead of the standard one that comes with the phone. I'd almost be willing to tackle calculus class with it
B005LAIIKI|2.0|i left the theatre wholly unamazed by this latest tarantino flick. it was shallow, clever-less, ego barf. c'mon, starting out with the same cheesy theme song to tarantino's produced film \\"django sukiyaki\\" showed this was going to be like an only childs' re-imaginings in the sand box with his tin soldiers and a box of firecrackers...rarely intriguing, senselessly violent, completely impossible, undeveloped, and worst of all: unintelligent. the very quality of tarantino's films that tied it all together and drew us into them wide-eyed with wonder has been drummed out with excess revolver shot and yanks pretending to be southerners in this slave's revenge farce. in direct address to those of you who say \\"95% of everybody liked it, so i must be outta touch\\": just because the masses agree on something doesn't substantiate it as quality or worthy of encouragement, some examples... americans and slavery, germans during the holocaust, macdonalds, apartheid, epidemic obesity rates, jihadism, as well as senselessly violent and poorly conceived films that perpetuate such thoughtless sentiment.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Entertaining and easy to figure out how to play yet still very challenging. I would reccomend this to people who like these types of games.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I really liked this movie.  The actors/actresses did a great job in playing their role.  What I really loved was the ending.  I didn't think the ending would have been that way.  It is entertaining and at time eery but great!  Not a nail biter.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like to play this on my kindle fire. Every single day, several times a day, I have to uninstall the app and re-download the app from my cloud. The problem with this is that i keep having to start from scratch and re-purchase my upgrades. Each time I start making progress I have to do the same thing again. Once this glitch is fixed, I would rate this 5!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Yes, Colin is hot in this movie BUT that is not why I liked it.  Kate Beckinsale kicked BUTT!  I enjoy her movies and she was totally rocking it in this movie.  it was action packed and everyone did great with there parts.  This is a movie a could watch over and over.  a lot better than Arnold's movie.  But, again that could be because of all the upgrade enhancements we now have.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love all things HP, but didn't want all the extras and to pay all that money for the giant box set.  This is perfect and simple and fits nicely with my DVD collection instead of having to display it elsewhere.
B00867GHS8|3.0|I'm one of the fans of this movie so when I've upgraded my TV and DVD player to HD 3D capable it was my first choice to get when I saw this movie exists in 3D version. I guess my expectations were too high (like seeing fish swimming in the middle of the room) so it was slightly disappointing not to have 3D effects more expressed with all possibilities this movie provides. Not sure if it's done on purpose so not to scare kids but comparing to other 3Ds this is almost like a regular movie,great and very vivid, but more 2D. I was showing 2 min previews of 3D movies from Vudu to my 5 year old before that and after watching this movie I asked if it looked like these 3ds to her. She said \\"not really\\". So even as this movie itself great I don't think it's the best 3D implementation of it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book series was so popular and I got it. The book  mockingjay is pretty good. I really like the ending. It made me cry. It is just SO SAD. I thought/think that if you don't like violence, then don't read it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|it works like my phone so its nice when i misplace my phone. i can never hear my husbands phone alarm even though it goes off alot this is just a nice alternative
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I also gave it as a gift to a music lover and he loved it as well
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love it. It is easyto do and lots of fun.<br />I strongly suggest that you get this game if you like puzzles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wish they had a second one because I would totally get it I love this game it is the best game ever
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Amazing album. Worth every penny! I really love how I was able to download it within minutes after my purchase so I could enjoy it even before it came in the mail!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it better than the original I wish there was a temple run 3 because I would get it I love it a lot
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Love this movie and this set was great.  Kids love seeing it on the end table and ask to watch it constantly
B00471JSR4|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  I recommend this movie to anyone that like action
B0094K1WZE|5.0|It was an action packed movie that was great on my TV  and free with Amazon prime with great picture and sound.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|The worst ,most silly, boring movie i'd ever seen. Why make a meaningless movie such as this? WHAT'S THE POINT?
B009CF7GRY|5.0|I love my streaming device and Amazon Prime. It is easy to use and the quality is great! I would suggest it to everyone.
B00AJLHUYO|3.0|Watched movie last night. There's no doubt the movie has it's moments of scares. What could have been done much better was the ghost make up. I think it was a very poor job. I've watched budget scary movies that do a much better job at doing the make up. That kind of killed the whole scary theme of the movie. The ghosts looked more like they were Halloween costumes. The make up artist from this movie should take lessons from the people that do the make up from The Walking Dead series.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was ok. Would I recommend it? Probably Not. You want to watch a good scary movie? Watch The Possession.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is a great way to pass time and I very addicting I play it all the time and works great unlike the other rip offs except for survival craft which is also great buy it it is worth it.
B0000695JP|5.0|This is a movie that our kids loved growing up so I ordered a copy.  For some reason most copies were very expensive but this one wasn't.  Being the cheapo that I am I ordered it even though it clearly stated &#34;Zone 2&#34; on the packaging.  I thought &#34;Zone 2&#34; referred to shipping but it is a country code.  I had to make several changes on my DVD player in order to ge tit to play.  But once those changes were made it played fine.  I know a lot of other people would give this a poor rating because of the zone 2 problem, but really they were up front about it and provided what they said they would.  Just because I didn't look into it further is no reason to give them a bad rating.  So buyer beware, this is for Zone 2, which is England, etc.  It will not play on DVD players in the USA without making changes to your setup.  Then it will only play 5 times before it won't work any longer.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book for several reasons.  First of all, the characters were well fleshed out and believable.  Second, there were always surprises... the plot was not predictable and includes some twists.  Another thing I really liked was the attention to detail historically.  I learned quite a bit about late era Stalin Russia and the conditions then.  The book moved at a good pace, and it was hard to put down!
B004N6369Y|5.0|I was concerned about the reviews but if you enjoy Ms Steele you will enjoy this. To me her books are a small escape from 'normal'.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|There has been too few films that capture both the sprit of the character that they were made for, and successfully reboot an entire film franchise. Christopher Nolan's &#34;Batman Begins&#34; (2005) is such a film. It allows the viewers to go back to the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman, and explains the training that he learned in order to become a heroic symbol for Gotham City. The acting, set design, and narrative are all excellent, with great nods to the comics and graphic novels that have made Batman a legendary character. The film also tracks Bruce's own self development and progress from mourning 8 year old, to skilled crime fighter. Many other viewers simply describe this film as a seminal or &#34;mostly decent&#34; Batman movie, but there are some distinct elements and casting choices that give this film an edge over other Batman films, including the original 1989 epic.<br /><br />1.) Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes--In my humble opinion, (yours may be different) Holmes was the &#34;better&#34; Rachel Dawes. She was not a femme fatale by any means, but she embodied a strong willed, intelligent, and courageous woman with a purpose. This was and still is a welcome surprise to me as a viewer. What had been so repetitive and redundant in the original 1989-1997 Batman series was the fact that the lead female character (except for Pfeffer's Selina Kyle) was often a &#34;damsel in distress&#34;. Rachel also has a distinct function within the film's narrative. She feels obligated to rid Gotham of crime and injustice, but also is very vulnerable, and is a childhood friend of Bruce. Katie's performance was solid, giving viewers the impression that Rachel was both an independent and sensitive woman; one that should not be crossed. Sadly, all that Holmes brought to Rachel Dawes, and in turn the Nolan Batman franchise has been widely forgotten,  ever since Maggie Gyllenhall was cast in &#34;The Dark Knight&#34;.<br /><br />2.) Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone.Looking back on this film, who else could have played the &#34;The Roman&#34; (Carmine's nickname from the comics) anyway? Wilkinson's acting prowess is fully utilized here, despite his brief screen time. His &#34;New York&#34;/ &#34;Chicago&#34; accent was brilliant, why can't he play more characters like Carmine in other films? Tom's take on Carmine was the kind of &#34;old world&#34; gangster, the kind of criminal that cops and other crooks alike could be afraid of. It would have been interesting to see Carmine return in another Batman film, especially if Wilkinson reprised the role.<br /><br />3.) Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth. What else can be said about Caine here? One of the most prolific and imperative actors of his time, Caine embodied a fatherly warmth and comedic relief to his character, which was similar but also different from Michael Gough (RIP) from the original 1989-1997 series. Caine's &#34;Alfred&#34; presented to the viewers a portrait of a butler whose balanced approach to life also provides a great moral guide to Bruce Wayne and his mission as Batman.<br /><br />4.) Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Freeman's &#34;Lucius&#34; serves as the brains behind Batman, the &#34;Q&#34; or &#34;Quartermaster&#34; of the franchise, and also provides the scientific and technological basis for all of Batman's unique gadgets and vehicles, including &#34;the tumbler&#34;. Freeman's performance as Lucius is sharp and witty, providing viewers with a smart, and humorous african american character, which up until this film, was not in any other of the Batman movies.<br /><br />5.) Gary Oldman as James W. Gordon--Who else could have played this Iconic character better? Another one of the most potent and powerful actors our time, portraying one of the most important characters in the Batman mythos. What can be better than that? Oldman remains as the best actor, giving the best performance in this film, as well as the entire Nolan Batman Trilogy. What was most refreshing about Oldman's take on &#34;James Gordon&#34; didn't just come from his performance, but also his conception; which allows Gordon's development as a cop to serve as a parallel to Batman and his experiences as a crime fighter. Gordon is a confident and capable cop in this film, which was more in line with Frank Miller's &#34;Batman Year One&#34; (1987 Comic) and a far cry from the late Pat Hingle's character from the original 1989-1997 Batman film series.<br /><br />6.) Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul. Inspired Performance, Great Character Conception,Ducard maintains both the mentor and adversary role well, and his sense of purpose (destroying Gotham through fear) and it shows in Neeson's performance. Neeson uses a certain craftsmanship in shaping his character, and it presents Ra's as both as a master tactician, and ruthless villain. (Enough Said!!)<br /><br />Overall, Nolan's &#34;Batman Begins&#34; was a classic film, one that deserves more credit, due to the fact it re-established Batman as a tragic avenger, a feared and symbolic creature of the night. Christian Bale gives a powerful performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman that is full of impact. At the time of the film's release, no one that I knew (myself included) could have predicted that the film would not just be successful, but also provide the definitive origin story to Bruce Wayne's career as the Caped Crusader.<br /><br />5 out 5.<br /><br />On a side note, however, one thing that was missed in this film was Talia, Ra's Al Ghul's beautiful, yet deadly daughter. Despite her appearance in Nolan's Bat finale, she would have been better utilized (in my opinion) as a tragic love interest; which would have provided Bruce with a tough choice in becoming Batman, and it would have also given Nolan and Co. another female supporting character who could be tied more closely with Batman and his origins.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is very addictive!  The Cube Attack mode is my favorite.  Neat that you can rotate the cube around to look for matches.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|First of all this is a great app BUT after i had it for a few weeks the software must have disabled the dictionary that my Android uses and now it wants me to pay for a 5$ dictionary \\"plug-in\\"!!! I had been using this app for @ a month with no problems. It ran the spell check with the same interface that I get when I write emails. Now it just shows a popup with a link to their dictionary plugin... I paid 15$ and I have some serious buyers remorse...
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This calculator has just about every option you need, except for graphing.  Got this on the Deal of the Day -- very satisfied with this app!
B00004YA66|5.0|This is one of the best time slip movies I've ever seen.  Brilliantly written.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.  There is never a dull moment here and you don't know how things will turn out till the very end.  I highly recommend it.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Love it.  Can't wait to the final installtaion comes out.  This was great, Can't believe that this is the same girl from the Panic Room.<br /><br />All are great in movie....even got my husband watching the entire chapter after he was making fun that I was a twihard.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Would highly recommend it... hard to put down once you get started. Very heartwarming story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An outstanding well written work.  This novel was as good as, if not better than the first book, The Hunger Games.  Am presently working on Mockingjay and well be sorry when I finish as it is the last one of the series.
B00000DFRS|5.0|This was a good cd. I love Whitney's voice! I got it at such a great price! I'm very happy with my purchase!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved the book. One my favorite books of all time! Every one should get it! So touching at some parts and surprising at others.
B005LAII1C|2.0|Very dissapointed in this movie.I guess I expected more from the actor who is normally in quality films.I would not reccomend this as a buy.I will not watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing. Full of detail,drama,romance,just.......amazing. I was stuck to this book, literally i could not stop reading it. The best book ever
B007REW8DO|5.0|This album is by far the only album I have ever heard that has had me on every song. I was listening to this album over and over again for over a month without getting tired of it. Absolutely amazing. The songs can almost all be related to.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Some of Michael Bloomfield's finest work. Too bad he wasn't available for the whole recording session. That being said doesn't make this a bad album. Stephen Stills' work is also pretty impressive. Much thanks to Al Kopper for making this collection come to life.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I listen to it somewhat, but it gets caught up in the giant list of songs I listen to. Though it's another album that followed their system of a few dirty songs, a couple fun songs, a couple meaningful songs, and some that are in between the others.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Although never being a fan of Star Trek except The Next Generation, I have to say this was an awesome movie.  In the making of the film I did discover why I felt like I was betraying my Star Wars exclusive love though and that reason being Star Wars is more Character driven while Star Trek is just that more Trek gadget and engineering driven, this movie taking all that into consideration was made to appeal to both genres and it did do so just perfectly.  Loved it. I have heard they are making another and for sure I want to see that.  Enjoy this it is great.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|This is an amazing product. Great quality and amazing songs. Anyone who likes Maroon 5 would like this album here!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My favorite all time series, amazing acting and beautiful locations.  Powerful story line all seasons.  Well worth starting from the beginning, which by the way was the day after the Titanic sunk.  Powerful series, now just completed the third season, hopefully many more to go.  This Season, 2 deals mostly with war and the conflicts of a country and its people at and in war.  Buy all seasons you will not be sorry.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is so fun. I like it because I am able to buy extras without real money. The graphics are cool.
B00005O3VC|2.0|Liked the stage version so much better.  Love British humour but this was even a wee bit bizarre for them.  Did not help that the case for the dvd did come damaged as well, could return but probably will give as a gift to someone who will enjoy more than I.  I would skip this and just enjoy on youtube.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Comic almost made me cry, and one I can say is an Adult comic.  I usually don't like comics but this one is a keeper.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|A beautiful and powerful movie.  Heath and Jake and Michelle and Anne do a beautiful job. so glad to have this memory of Heath for he passed way to soon.  Love it and loved the ground it broke, love is love no matter what.  Thought the subject matter was dealt with in deep respect. Never thought I would see something like this in my lifetime, a standing ovation in my book.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Excellent read, exciting, hot sex, and humorous. All added up to a perfect combination. I am ready for more in this series.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|A beautiful series depicting King Henry's life and six wives, Powerfully done, filmed a lot in Ireland.  We were blessed to visit Christ Church in Dublin and see a lovely display of costumes from the series.  If you love history you will love the entire series and learn a lot in the watching.  Well worth the investment. It was the pre-Downton Abbey series that was awesome and now the Downton Abbey series is as well.  BBC does it with class.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|i do like thhis book.. the tv show is way better. its on amc. i hope they kill carl lol it was a awesome and it realy did  gret job
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Not nearly as good as the second film but it had its moments, i couldn't get over banes voice, sounded like a certain well known scotsman with a head cold &#62;_&#62;
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book. If I were to read another book, it would definitely have to be The Son Of Neptune.
B003XF1OJK|3.0|but not great very poor character self development, but still a good enough read to make me want to read the other books .
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I introduced this game to others and they also became addicted. I keep trying to beat my own score. When I let someone play on my Kindle I wish they could record the score under thier name.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Not a normal book that I led read but was looking for something different.....it had me at the very start an I completed it in 2 days.....very good book about inner growth.
1416572287|4.0|After working at a dog camp you really get the point of the dog and how to talk to your dog. Puts physics in a very practical way of thinking
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game. Definitely enjoy playing this game. Love hidden object games and this is one of my favorites. Would recommend
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a such a great game but I wish on creative you get all the stuff from survival. For example there should be shears , animals , and also flint and steel
B005K17RU0|3.0|Last sunday-Monday We had a snowstorm,Accuweather said it was sunny all day here while I watched about 6 inches of snow pile up. The maps were ok,and it gave the weather alert,but don't tell me it's sunny in a snow storm.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book can't wait to read the next one! The movie is great as well! Love love love :-)
1932100660|5.0|I ordered another 2 copies just so I can lend it out to friends and spread the word!  Since reading I've cut down on meat and dairy considerably and feel very good!
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Quick read that is impossible to put down. What's interesting is how far I got into the book still trying to predict what was really going on.<br /><br />You can call it magic or fantasy, but who really knows the limits of the human mind and our connections to other worlds & dimensions?<br /><br />I gave it 4 Stars for suspense, humor, flow and overall entertainment.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A quick, fascinating read. I highly recommend to anyone who's a teacher or going to be. The book was truly entertaining with a satisfying end.
1439152802|3.0|The story started fine, but the middle dragged.  I was often confused by the back and forth of time periods (mother/daughter).<br />I eventually just read the parts related to the senior character (mother) and found it to be a great historical fiction story.<br />Clever ending.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. It is inspiring and teaches important lessons.Great for ALL ages!
0385535147|2.0|I plodded along through the book.  The story repeats a lot, I often wondered if I had already read the pages and started in wrong place. There is not enough story for a book this long.  Would not recommend the book.
B000V7J80U|5.0|Sounds great. the vocals and the music is perfectly heard equally and clear. nothing compressed, sounds great on surround sound. no pops, one of the best vinyl records i have purchased. &#34;Clap Hands&#34;, &#34;Blind Love&#34;, &#34;Time&#34;, &#34;Gun Street Girl&#34; are highlights on this album for me and yinyl is the only format to hear these songs.......
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|For the price it's hard to complain too much.  The tie clip broke quite easily, the mic has lots of noise, there's no LED battery indicator, and the mic can be rather noisy at times depending on how it's attached to your subject and what it's plugged into.  Having a longer cord can be nice at times, but most of the time it just gets in the way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome. Words can't explain how tight it is. Man, when I'm bored I pick up a kindle and play subway surfer. It dope.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great series.  I went to see The Hunger Games movie somewhat under duress but was hooked and had to have this book to complete reading the series.  It was just as good as the first and a wonderful read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was an American Hero. This story doesn't hold back in describing his mistakes and his successes. He was a hero, and he suffered and fought for freedom. He made some mistakes and decisions like every other human, but don't just say he's human, he was an extraordinary human. God Bless Chris, his family and all of our soldiers in each and every branch, and their families for paying the ultimate price in pursuit of what they believe in.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great collection of wonderful stories.  I like that the packaging is compact and doesn't take up much space.  Very convenient to have all the Harry Potter movies together in one set.  Our family will be watching these for years to come.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Great family movie, a lot of humor, fun. It will be watched a lot, over and over. Kids loved it.
0062014536|3.0|I just finished reading Requiem and Im so disappointed To the point that I had to write a review. This is the first time I've written a review and its not a good one. I waited anxiously for the release of this book and Lauren Oliver has disappointed me.<br />The book was interesting, it had its moments where I couldnt stop reading because I wanted to get to the point that we all have been waiting for: when Lena finally makes her choice. Well sadly Im still waiting.<br />The last few chapters are rushed. We stop getting updates from Hana and we never know what happens to her. The ending starts getting suspensful and then it's like a balloon when you blow it up to be good and then let go. Pfft. Definitely not what I expected.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|awesome movie, the actors were great, scenery. Also it was a peek into the French revolution. Will watch many times
B0000DZU4U|4.0|The rest of the concert from December 1973. I think it's killer.  I don't know why the other review gave only one star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was introduced to this by my friend and it is the funniest game on a touch screen device on my opinion and I think this game is way better than temple run and most other games that a lot of people recommend I think it's awesome
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game, but you need more things that are on the computer version like caves and more objects.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best but u guys should really lower the price for characters and power ups and stuff like tht cause u can tht much coins in the game and if u can do this it would be cool and I will tell more friends about this game
1846556007|5.0|I'd been waiting for this book to come out in English for quite some time.  The mesmerizing twisty-plot story stood alone, but also served to answer a lot of questions about Harry's motivations in the later books.  So many issues, such a tumultuous larger-than life he has lived!  I've read and loved all but one of the rest of the nine-book series, and now am waiting for The Cockroach to be translated into English.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This is an ok dictionary , but what would make it better is that you could type the word you want. But it is ok.
B008220B0C|5.0|Katy Perry is just normal as we are but a worldwide successful tour can break you but you become more stronger as you get through out the tough times (missing/wanting to spend time with an significant other, divorce).
0385535147|2.0|I love the John Grisham format.  We meet someone who has been wronged or decides to fight injustice in some way.  His formula works and it makes us appreciate the full legal thriller.  This book just simply falls apart early and keeps on doing so.  The plot is twisted and not in a good way.  The protagonist if you call him that is just plan unattractive as are all characters in the book. It twists and meanders and follows no logical course of action.  It easily goes down dead ends and is just about as  confusing as a book can be.  There is no one to root for and the end is satisfying so the implausible nature of the book ends along with it.<br /><br />I love Grisham and will read his next book.  I will reread some of his more recent books including The Confession an excellent work.  But this one just isn't there.  Wait for the next one.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable is so nice.  It's long, white (as advertised!), and it plugs into things.  I started by charging my kindle with it, but then I realized it has so many more uses!  It can be used for whipping your pets when they misbehave, for fastening your handgun to a belt loop...I even use it to tie off my arm when I shoot up heroin!  Thank you Amazon Digital Services, Inc!  You're making the world a better place, one cable at a time!
0425252868|5.0|I am not one who likes wartime stories that focus on strategy, battles, etc.  I love reading about real people in all walks of life, what led them to make decisions impacting self and others.  This book gives the story of two men in a way that I felt like I knew them.  I really liked that the book was written in a way that I didn't have to know about every WWII turn of events.<br /><br />I was interrupted by a phone call at a critical point in the book.  The story was so gripping, I was eager to return.<br /><br />As others have said, the end of the book was very emotional.<br /><br />My thanks to all our veterans and all the men and women serving in harms way.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|I can't recommend the Dr. Panda games enough. Fun, interactive, clean graphics, easy to understand and plenty of fun things to do. The Dr. Panda games can be a little repetitive and if you are looking for some fun distractions for say a two-hour car ride for your youngster, I would recommend spending the $6-7 and buying all the Dr. Panda games.<br /><br />And if your son/daughter is like mine and loves to play &#34;doctor/vet&#34; on her toys, there is no better game. I tried several others and this is far and away the best you'll find.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Question! Question! Question! That is what Mr. Feynman teaches us.  Never accept without testing to see if it is true. To do what is accepted and normal is not fun. Just because everyone else believes something is true does not mean it is. Pop the balloon that is pomposity!<br /><br />What a treasure.  How do we cultivate more Mr. Feynmans?<br /><br />An excellent book.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Awesome didn't want it to end.  Have bought all of Kings books and willed them to my daughter when I'm gone
1400067820|4.0|I have read all of Taleb's books except for Dynamic Hedging which requires a level of mathematical sophistication I do not have. This is an interesting book with some good ideas but it definitely is not an 'easy read'. The only complaint I have about his writings is that he never gives you advice on how to actually use his ideas.<br /><br />He mentions a barbell portfolio and 'insuring' your portfolio just as you do a house or a car. I have been able to use this advice. I wish he would write something that says, 'you know what I believe about investing and this is how you implement those beliefs'. Then he will have done what so many of us have been waiting for.
1616550414|4.0|I like this one, but so many Skyward Sword artworks and no new content or sketches about the classic ones is a bit odd.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good background to the WW 11, but this time I feel Ken Follett is trying to reach a broader audience by making it too much of a romantic historical novel. Maybe it's me, but I'm discouraged by the constant emphasis on &#34;romance/sex between the principals. The details on the War are interesting and absorbing though.
030758836X|3.0|I purchased this book because it had been on the best seller list for weeks and expected more. I put it down after about 50 pages, which is rare for me. Maybe it improves  with perseverance, but life is too short to read boring books.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  Even though we all know how the story ends I was caught holding my breath several times in suspense not knowing what twist or turn would come up next.  Sometimes when a movie is too hyped up I feel it falls short of expectations; but not Argo.  It really is a must see film.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is the best Christmas Carol movie ever.  Jim Carrey is a great actor and portrays Scouge better than any other actor I have seen.  A must have for every movie library.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This film was a great mix of a good story line, action and thriller.  I'm not big on shoot 'em up films and my husband doesn't like too much sentimentality.  We were both able to enjoy this film!  It's one of those rare movies that seems balances in all areas.  Truly unique concept with likable characters.  Pay attention, it truly does loop and loop around so you don't want to get confused or lost.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|like the game be cool if there was more classes. easy controls and fighting styles. more companions would be nice to. overall good game.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|I was under the impression that the AmazonBasics line of products was designed to offer reasonable quality while undercutting the competition.  But I've noticed at least a couple of 24-packs of banana plugs here that are lower in price than these- not by much, admittedly.  That said, these plugs are of solid enough metal  construction and work just fine.  For about 20 bucks, you get enough plugs for 6 speakers, or a surround-sound system.  The gold plating is pretty standard these days, and you can connect your wire either from the side or the end of the plug. The red and black color-coding is easily seen. They do work best with heavier wire gauges, so do yourself a favor and don't use the thin stuff.  Of course, your equipment needs to have banana jacks, as these plugs will not fit into most standard speaker terminals.  The \\"hassle-free\\" packaging is a plain corrugated box, though the plugs themselves are held in clear plastic trays. Not the cheapest price, but pretty good overall.
0671646788|5.0|I got this book as a recomendation from a friend. I love the book, it is so insightful and simple at the same time. THe author give a lot of good example and hits the topic right on the nail. For me it is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so well written. The story was clever, the main characters were SO lovable, and it captured so perfectly the blossoming of a relationship - No words wasted, every emotion captured and put under magnifying glass...<br />This writer obviously possesses great powers of observation, and is incredibly in touch with emotion, subtleties of both the small but significant and the huge and dramatic incidents in life.<br /><br />There are NO awkward moments, clumsy writing where you're not quite sure what the author is trying to say, or where they can't quite capture the very essence of the littlest things. NO no no. This author does EVERYTHING PERFECTLY.<br /><br />This book made me laugh out loud, grin crazily, cry and grind my teeth, amongst others. It is one to be treasured. I dare you not to fall in love with Sky, Holder, or both.<br /><br /> Put it at the top of your TBR!
0062238868|2.0|While there is merit to \\"service to country\\" and this man<br />served well, of the many auto or bio graphical stories told<br />and books written on war, this story was simply NOT a building<br />block for understanding, contemplation nor mind or soul expansion.<br /><br />All service men serve...and few seem in need of exploiting<br />the intrinsic curiosity that exists in the minds of those of us to 'wait and pray'<br />and this story is more about the 'role' played by ONE(to a few) warrior(s)s<br />amongst the many others who were ALSO dedicated to their own equally heralded roles in the war!<br /><br />This story should have been archived for the family to read in the privacy<br />and exclusiveness of their home...and in REMEMBRANCE of this seemingly obsessed<br />man.<br /><br />He died as he lived...and the odds played against him as he continued to<br />share his skill even with the warriors who would likely have benefitted<br />more from sharing time with those who served<br />and appropriate therapy(PTSD).<br /><br />A visit to the firing range seems a bit like curing the ailment<br />as in<br />a 'bit of the hair of the dog that bit thee'! And this rarely an applicable<br />treatment!<br /><br />GOD BLESS his family and this fallen warrior.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Best Dark Knight movie by far! Highly recommend this product as a gift. Arrived very quickly and on time. Picture quality is amazing.
B00005JPD0|5.0|ACTOR and story line.<br /><br />Excellent...and enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend for all who or who are not Denzel fans!<br /><br />HE 'makes' the movie 'move'!
B007KLY8FA|5.0|i do not have much Ahmad Jamal in my collection so i decided to make purchase after checking out reviews on Amazon and was glad i did purchase it.The music is beyond good.I now understand why the great Miles Davis consider him his favorite pianist.On limited amount of tracks there is some surface noise do not let that stop u from making purchase for the price it is a great,great,great bargain.To me it is priceless.What an extraordinary musician i guess Miles knows what he is talking about.
B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|It's okay.  Typical matchmaking where the main character buts into everyone elses lives and doesn't even realize her own emotions.  Am reading it for a Humanities class.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Even though this movie is in French the story flows so smoothly that you will forget that you are reading subtitles. The actors are excellent, especially Omar Sy playing the live-in home attendant. Everyone does an excellent job and if you watch to the credits you will see a brief shot of the real people portrayed in the movie. Highly recommended as a feel good movie and should of been given an Academy Award for sure.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I don't like a lot of today's country music. To me it's to much pop and all sounds the same.<br />This sounds more like country to me.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Its a fun hidden objects game. They have challenges that keep it interesting.  I would recommend this game to hidden objects lovers.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|We saw it in the theater with one of our boys (6) and we liked it so much we just bought it so we could watch it multiple times.  Our older son (8) loves it too.  It might be a little scary in places for younger kids - Pitch is not nice!  But Jack is a great character and both the boys loved Sandman.  I love this portrayal of Santa as well - who knew he was so tough!
B000P0J09W|2.0|Movie freezes in more than 3 areas throughout entirety which is very irritating! This is one that we will not watch again
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Clint Eastwood in his most recent films (Grand Torino & Trouble With The Curve) plays a similar bitter old man role that I absolutely love. Good movie
0761169253|5.0|Life-changing book about creativity and how it really works.  Very liberating for the artist or would-be artist - would make a terrific gift.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol is one of the best classic books ever written. A multiple time read and will continue to read it again and again.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|works great and i have encountered NO problems.  i only wish i would have gotten this app sooner; that's my regret.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Another timeless classic. Absolutely wonderful. Best of all i needed it for class and my teacher loved the e edition.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This complete collection is a perfect gift for fans. If your a fan of the show it contains every episode (filled with extras) and a few small \\"gifts\\" included in the box. But if your just a superman fan than this set is also perfect, with every episode the legend of how superman became the hero we know and love is captured with every episode, from the crash landing in smallville to his first \\"official\\" flight(lol, when you watch the show you will understand why official is in \\"\\") this item is for you.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Jane Austen hit the nail on the head with this story. Have loved it ever since reading it in high school.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I spend most of my day reading student papers and preparing lessons and activities. When I get home, the last thing I want to read is more of the same. This book was a great break from that. I have enjoyed getting to know the characters and how they are all intertwined. It is helpful that there are maps and genealogies.  There are a lot of characters. Once you are about halfway through, they are much easier to keep straight. I enjoy the writing and the interplay among the characters. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a book that is entertaining but also keeps you on your toes.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An unbelievably powerful novel that keeps you guessing the whole way....Landay poses some serious and intriguing questions about loyalty to family no matter what the cost...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a free app for the Kindle that has been very handy. We used it to set an alarm that would not disturb our dogs but would wake us up to put more wood on the fire. It did just that. The alarm is easy to set, it is easy to read, and the alarm is not obnoxious. Glad that we downloaded it. Also glad to have it when we are concerned about power outages. Have not missed work because if no alarm yet.
0062238868|5.0|Really makes you understand what our military sacrifice for our freedom and what they go through.  Very enlightening.  Easy read!
B009O2XY12|4.0|this is a great game. its just like bubble birds. its just that you have to wait to refill your power. that's why I only put four stars.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game but it won't load anymore it keeps kicking me out...I hate this especially since I have spent real money on the game and now I can no longer play it
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I think if you think this cd will re unite you with the killers and bring you back the the Hot Fuss music and style you are wrong. I think if you haven't liked their work other than hot fuss and parts of sams town that you really do not like the killers and this is a bad taste for you. I have played this cd to two people who &#34;loved&#34; the killers but didn't like the last 2-3 cd's they made and they didn't like this cd even with a lack of truly listening to it. I also played this cd to two others that were impartial and they absolutely love this cd! You will not like the cd if you are wanting your own music out of it. This is the killers and what they create. This is truly music(or at least what it should be) and it leaves me waiting to buy their next album the second it is made.<br />AMAZING!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|To all the true delirium fan who have followed the series from start to it's now end, Requiem has delivered the promise that it has made to us. It shows the different levels of love that people experience, and especially the sacrifices we make for those we love. AMAZING READ and I thank goodreads.com and Lauren Oliver for the great thrill ride you've provided. Now to read 'Before I Die'
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|They are not Led Zeppelin.<br />Otherwise, I like them very much.  They are kind of folky but not not in a way that I would have thought of as folk.  I think they fall into that nowhere between the categories at the music store.<br />It is easy to listen to and likable.<br />It was delivered quickly.
0345803485|5.0|i really enjoy this book i plan on ordering 2 and 3 to come pleat the set cant wait to read them
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|I'm very sick of \\"vegetarian\\" Vikings, Romans, Greeks etc. In otherwords politcally correct stories and scenes where we/screenwriters try to make the protagonists, or the feel of the story, is advancing to some liberal Utopian future. There is one scene where this shines forth in the first episode when the woman fights off two men with the sword and throws them out of her hut for threatening to rape her. I'm sorry but this is getting ridiculous. A generation of little girls are growing up to think they can whack a 250lbs man with a judo chop i.e. Angelina Jolie and the type. Now, I'm all for women being a threat and/or lethal but I'm sick of the seemingly default setting for women protagonist nowadays: they can beat up men. It's harder to write scenes where the woman would have to be clever. So, it's almost a slap in the face to feminism, which strives for Utopia, for making women appear equal in brawn to men.<br /><br />Other than that, I thought it was a good start and looks promising. But, I bet it will digress into more political correctness, when the screen writer portrays the Viking's as more spiritually enlightened than the Christians they are poised to plunder. Movie maker and screen writer types are getting very predictable and after years of going to the movies and watching tv series ...this is what I see. I hope I'm wrong on this one. Can we please have \\"real\\" characters and stories and not look at people in the past with our postmodern eyes and assume they wanted to be like us?<br /><br />The lack of politically correctness is one of the things that made Downton Abbey so appealing, but alas, now it appears headed for the land of PC.
B008220C56|1.0|I'm sure that this is an excellent movie.  However, I ordered it from Amazon, and it does not play.  I wish that I could get a replacement disk which actually played.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I read this book so quickly, I couldn't put it down! Chris Colfer is AMAZING and I love his writing style! I'm so happy I bought this book and I plan on reading it again. It was GREAT!!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Self-help at its core. I found myself slowing down after half way because 1)it is a book that I would like to never stop reading and 2) the will to battle Resistance grew with every page, and with this new found strength I became enamored with my own work.<br /><br />Good for the likes of all professions, not just the arts.
0618918248|5.0|Great book by a very intelligent author who makes logical arguments against religion, often above the level of the average reader.  Richard Dawkins is not as humorous as Christopher Hitchens, but his reasoning is sound.
B003L77G06|5.0|We can't stop watching Modern Family.  This DVD is wonderful.  It is very easy to move through the episodes and the quality is excellent.  I would recommend it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Its fast and easy to use and a waste of money any other calculator wold suffice but its fine and weird looking
B008PZ69Q6|5.0|Somewhere on these review pages a customer asks &#34;Why release this?&#34;  Well, according to a spokesman for SONY ( which owns Elvis' catalog) the reason is to satisfy that segment of the Elvis buying public who don't like remixes of any kind and only want the original vintage mixes.  That's what you get here.  No bright, modern remixes with guitars and drums mixed right up in your face.  Which is what you get with &#34;Prince From Another Planet.&#34;  As someone who only wants original vintage mixes I say, &#34;Thank you, SONY.&#34;
B008GXHOFW|5.0|You should get this game.<br />It is the best game I ever played.<br />If you don't get this game you are crazy.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very well made movie.....very tense and real look to it. Even though you know how it is going to end you felt the drama and worried if they were going to get out Iran safely.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the first book I have read of  g.r.r. Martin's but it won't be . The last!!!!!  Looking for the second one!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book. Nicholas sparks is  my favorite author! This bookwas a little differentfrom his usual books...but very interesting!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app!! Fun for both kids and adults, this is an enjoyable app with few bugs. It freezes occasionally, but it still runs great. I recommend playing it on a tablet, because the graphics look better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have always loved this game. Best thing on kindle fire. Recommended for people with kindle fires or kindle fire hd's.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I really liked Sachi's frankness. Her childhood was extremely unusual A mother who was in competition with her daughter as she became a threat to her lifestyle. A narcissistic mother and a daughter looking for approval. It is implied, but much therapy would be needed to screw the poor girls head on straight.  I am just glad she has found happiness with her husband and children. An insightful read into the life that everyone envies until you have to live it. Go Sachi.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the actual likeness to horses  really good graphics  the competitions are fun to participate in I just like this app
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This dramatic series just draws you in. The deep character development, rich story arch and most importantly politicians behaving as we would expect them to. The acting is top notch across the board and Kevin Spacey is a natural as an ambitious, ruthless, self serving politician who will go as far as using his own family and murder to position himself.<br /><br />What is interesting is the addition of Kevin's character addressing the audience. Is he talking to us or just explaining his twisted moves to himself? This drama is a welcome addition to my library.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I absolutely adore T&S and their latest album is just fabulous! I really like 'Now I'm All Messed Up' and 'I'm Not Your Hero' :)
B005DNOAQY|3.0|Good movie. If you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll like it. Jerry Lacy was great as Bogart.<br />Good movie. If you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll like it. Jerry Lacy was great as Bogart.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great little basic calculator! It was exactly what I was looking for and I use it all the time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had me laughing so hard I cried, and crying so hard I looked like I was laughing! 10/10 Will read again!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is just this dynamic between the characters that makes this something to return to. I have to stop myself because I don't want to get sick of this series. I can sympothize with the characters and enjoy this reality that is so different yet so similar to our own. Never a dull moment.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|ONE of my favorite books of all time, written so well giving insight into  the suffering in that region and how love and hope is present even on the most dire circumstances.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I DON'T NEED TO SEE SINGLES IN MY AREA. As soon as I began the game I had to deal with a full screen ad that was super annoying. Too bad because the game itself plays well.<br /><br />UPDATE: Singles Ads are gone now, but an ad shows after each game in full screen. At least, *most* of the time there is an \\"X\\" to close them. I really like this solitaire game, but the ads are a pain. Getting better though.
0143120530|5.0|Moonwalking with Einstein is an interesting book that contains a lot of information. You may expect that it is a self-learning book that tells you how to memorize or a physics book that relates to moonwalking or Einstein. But, no, this book is not about these topics. But you will be surprised if you read that. This book is about the story that how Joshua Foer, a journalist who was not so good at memorizing, becomes the winner of the USA Memory Championship. More than that, Moonwalking with Einstein is not a dry book that tells you only Joshua's story; there are a lot of interesting facts throughout the book like who is the most forgetful man in the world and normal people can only process 7 pieces of information at once. These things are good to know and hard to find in your daily life, and they can really expand reader's view.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I've had to reset my progress twice: once because a mandatory patch when it was brand new, again because it crashed. If you set the game to high settings but don't have the processor to handle it, it will crash. the catch? once you've set it, it will be forever broken, because you'll never be able to get to the menu to undo it. Only solution? Erase and install and lose all your progress. Not cool.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Just as good as the first time around... I liked it, I would recomend it to anyone who likes good movies...
B005LAIISA|5.0|With the start of the first 'Ice Age' they have just continued to get better and better. I can't wait to see if they will put out another one.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is very fun.On my Kindle Fire it buffers a little but works fine!Its fun because you can raise your own dragons.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Who would have thought an elephant could have so much personality. Well? Duh? Only if he's voiced byJim Carrey. Don't just let the kids watch this movie. Grab a bowl of popcorn and join them. You'll love it too.
B000002PCS|5.0|Words do not convey the intensity of the music or mood.  We have the movie on VHS - Disc and music on Record and CD.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Yeah! I thought it would be hokey, but it is anything but. Everyone will enjoy watching Robots, and not just the kids.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Saw him live - have the album but worn out - so happy to now have in on CD so we can play it anywhere.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting in every role! Interesting to learn about the interaction between the aristocracy and the servants!! Always keeps you wanting more!!!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I'll be honest right off the get-go, if it wasn't for my desire to see the movie and all the awards I would have never made it past the first chapter. Sometimes the author's desire to show Pat Peoples (the main character telling the story)  as a simple, emotionally broken man comes off instead as if Forest Gump is talking. A grown man that says, \\"the bad place\\" like a three year old gets really annoying after what seems like a hundred times in just a few pages. The same goes with \\"apart time.\\" So much so that I would like to go the rest of my life without ever hearing those phrases again. Also really hard to read the parts where he keeps mentioning his \\"black friend\\" and then repeats incredibly stereotypical lines. And one more writing issue- people don't describe scenery and how light spills in through windows when telling stories, specially if it has nothing to do with the story- that's what narrators are for.<br /><br />Outside of that I undersand why a movie was made from the book- the characters and the underlining story takes a hold of you. You're invested. Not just in the main character but in a slew of characters. You're rooting for two emotionally broken people. For a mom. For a brother. For friends and therapist.
1933952806|5.0|One of a kind, in complete detail. I recommend to everyone if you want to master Nikon D7000 please get this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This Book kept me wanting more time to keep reading.  What a wonderfully woven Trilogy.  Just a few more pages to read.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved this book so much! I would read it a hundred times! I CAN'T WAIT TO READ PART TWO MOMENTARILY!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of my favourite apps on ANY platform! I, like millions of others before me enjoy finding things I love and want to share via picture posts on any given item or personality, from shoes to inspiring quotes from famous and not so famous people! I appreciate the ease of use with this app and the response from the developers and customer service members any time I have a problem using this app. Give it a try! Thank you.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game reminds me of gauntlet legends(n64 version). I loved that game from this first level and, after getting used to the controls, I was hacking away just as I did in my youth. The only thing I would wish for is the ability to customize the characters appearance. You know hair, skin color and such. But since that's a minor preference I'll still give it 5 stars. Hack and slash fans should give this a try.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|With this latest instalment of the Ice Age Saga the focus turns to some valuable lessons of family, respect and trust from a young mammoth's standpoint! Great lessons for my kids AND me! :) We laughed a lot to the new and familiar favourite characters that make this series so endearing. It missed the fifth star only because in my opinion a few of the newer characters lacked the depth and sincerity that we have come to expect from the creators but overall a great movie for the whole family no matter what age you are! Thank you.
0439023483|5.0|What I really liked about the book would have to be all the detailed descriptions that the author put throughout. Whereas the movie they left out a lot of detail that was in the book, because that is one thing that I really liked about the book.  What I really did not like about the book is that it was written in first person present tense.  I have read books in my life, and never have I encountered such a difficult writing style that was extremely hard to follow. The book was written like how you'd explain a dream, or a story you'd tell a friend.  An example would be, \\"So, I was shopping at the mall right, and then Gale comes up to me, and he's like all, `Hey Katniss, I love you.'\\" That was the feeling through the whole book. I really didn't like that about it. Another thing that I didn't really like was that Katniss doesn't like Peeta in the end and Peeta is sad about it. This isn't really realistic. If you were with only one person from your district and you had to survive not only by not starving but from other people who try to kill you, I think the company of this one person would most likely get you to really like them because you'd be really close, although I really liked the book overall.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Author: Jamie McGuire<br />Published By: J.M.<br />Age Recommended: YA(some Language)Adult<br />Reviewed By: Arlena Dean<br />Book Blog For: GMTA<br />Rating: 4<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Disaster\\" by Jamie McGuire was something to read especially if you are into a dysfunctional drama(between Travis and Abby) from the beginning till the end. This read was really something to keep up with, which this author did do for the reader. It took me a minute to get into it...maybe a few chapters, but after I didn't put it down until the end, I just had to see what was going to happen next ...Wow, what a read this turned out to be. One with a good plot that had the reader on a roller-coaster ride...with drama and fighting (omg)and the characters were simple good in that they were so believable. Overall, I was able to even saw some humor in a lots of the going on in \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\" Definitely, this title tells it all! Now, if you are in for a interesting read that is full of 'love, hate, jealous, uncertainty, denial and what ever else that comes from a new relationship' you have come to the right place for \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" will give it all to you and even more.<br /><br />Would I recommend? Yes, only be ready for some 'disaster' that will take place.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game. Wish it had multiple levels. I completed it in one day. I like games like this one.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and he seems to really like it.  It has information for the entire history of the Zelda line, with great illustrations.  Good find!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm not sure what I expected from Chris Kyle's book.  I had been wanting to read his accounts ever since it was released, but never pulled the trigger.  Immediately after hearing the sad news of his untimely death, leaving behind wife and child, I decided to escalate my compassion and get an inside look at the man.  What better way.  What I wasn't expecting was to be thoroughly entertained.  Chris had a similar personality and sense of humor that isn't appreciated by everyone.  I also wasn't expecting was truthfulness.  The raw conversation without filter.  It's as if you're sitting down with him enjoying a beer.  Insider look into SEAL training and tactics was a definite plus.  Heck, I even got product reviews from him.  I'm wearing a pair of Merrell hight-top boots right now because of his mention of their comfort.<br /><br />I'm not even done with the book.  Several hundred pages on my Kindle app.  This will not disappoint even if you rarely read for entertainment.
B005FISC52|5.0|Great product. Love the show. really enjoy it. Sad its over. If you love one tree hill buy the show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Both adults and children in the family love this game. Recommend to anyone enjoying a little bit of light gaming. Great fun for all the family.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|I saw Scotty on America Idol and love his singing. We don't have this cd in Australia. If you want a good cd buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Recommended 4 all people who have a life and like books where kattness kills Collins writes with raw power awesome
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I really enjoy this tv show. Now i am hook watching the other series to this show. watch it you want regret it.
B000002GB4|5.0|STYX WAS A VERY UNDERRATED ROCK BAND FROM THE 70'S. THIS IS A GREAT C.D.  KILLER SONGS INCLUDE JENNIFER,PUT ME ON AND CRYSTAL BALL. FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I saw this book never heard of the author or title before. So, i tried it and loved it i couldnt put it down. Wish there was a sequel.
0345803485|5.0|i loved this book and then borrowed the other two books from a friend. This is a book you won't put down. Can't wait for the movie. Though my imagination is much better than a movie could be.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|Great movie and love that it was in blueray for a great price. couldnt pass it up for a grea deal.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|could not use on my kindle fire and would not order this product again. This was very disappointing to me
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Love this movie, its so great. i've seen it multiple times and had to own it. so i did and really enjoy it.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I wish I could give this  book five stars! Although it was a heartwarming story, it lacked in the middle. It had a great start, but lost me toward the middle only to real me  back in with the end. Their \\"relationship\\"  seemed pretty non existent to me for most of the book. That was the  most disappointing aspect, however it is worth the read!
B000SEFNMS|4.0|An interesting tale that at times reads as a personal story; at other times it meanders into related facts and historical personalities. The author offers analysis and commentary but makes this point clear to the reader, he also provides a comparison of his own life and previous reasoning to that of McCandless, a thoughtful and relevant touch.<br />Also in my brash opinion this book successfully attempts to get into the heads of \\"weirdos\\" and explain their reasoning and behavior. I thought this kid was a real idiot at first but also was able to emphasize better in the end, some of his actions.<br />Recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It has been a while since I have had a book capture me from the very beginning to the end. Hopeless entrapped me from the first pages. It is a book that you can draw your own conclusions of what happened and whose who but guaranteed you will never see the biggest surprise coming. It is a romance, a mystery, a tragedy, and a heart wrenching story in so many ways all at the same time. It had me laughing and crying. It had me excited and ready that left with needing so much more. In one word: Fantastic!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This  book was so good! I hope that the next book is as good as this one was! Please keep writing!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book shows a very realistic image of what war is like and how the people in it behave. I know because I have a nephew in Afganistan. I have enjoyed reading the book immensley
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I see why Hollywood liked this movie.  Great story that allowed itself to have fun with the characters.  I recommend it.
B006903GX8|3.0|It was a good look at what it took to create the series and what it was like for the people's lives that it was based on.<br />Not sure I would purchase the follow-up volume. It was not really designed to be on a Kindle screen and the photos do not copy well.
B00328R21C|5.0|The fact that you get many of the characters in this set is awesome. the Landspeeder has the lego terminals on the top, so the kids were able to add &#34;enhancements&#34; to it, and come up with their own Landspeeder/pod version.<br />Cool toy... and dad liked it too :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This freaking book left me with a book hangover that lasted for days!  I literally cried and cried while reading this book.  I wish I could have reached into the pages and hugged Sky and Holder!  Colleen Hoover has a profound gift for writing that makes you feel what the characters are feeling.  I truly loved this book.  My reviews are short, sweet and to the point, so don't confuse my brevity for lack of love.  If you love  The Breathing Series by Rebecca Donovan, you will love this story.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Awesome movie! Thoe I wasn't aware that the characters changes from the others I love it dearly! Action packed and fun!
B006362ZR6|5.0|Like The CD Like The Artist And Enjoyed The Music<br />The Fray Rocks Like All There Songs Are Good<br />Good CD A+++
B005EVVESM|5.0|Wonderful! Thank you for an amazing CD with great Vocals! Listening to it constantly and loving every song! Thank you!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|My original copy of Lilo and Stitch got scratched up by a friend and I almost cried. I love this movie, and can't wait to show it to my kids one day... oh who am I kidding, I'm going to watch this all the time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story is something I could not put down! I owe the kindle version and hard copy due to that fact! Thank you Nicholas Sparks!
B000RZIGUY|5.0|Face/Off is a classic action flick. The story is just so unique and original,that I don't think it could ever be done this good again.I always thought the whole idea of \\"becoming the criminal\\",to catch the criminal,was just so awesome. Travolta and Cage really put on a great performance in this movie. Every action lover NEEDS to have Face/Off in their DVD and/or Blu-Ray collection. Highly recommended.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Songs from Fifty Shades of Grey. Wonderful CD with lots of great songs, listen to it every day now! Thanks!
B007SGM084|5.0|I read this series twice. I love the spicy story line. The story has lots of romance and an amazing plot, it's a must read!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Another awesome cd from a great band! Thank you for making wonderful music that touches so many people! Love it!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was kind of like an R rated 50 shades of Grey. Same little love story on certain conditions. Good quick read. Glad it's over
1616550414|5.0|i just got my book in today and i was pretty excited about it, when peeled the plastic off of it and opened it, it smelled like a classic =)... i flipped through a few pages, and i was pretty stoked about what i saw, the art is on another level, the quality of the book (for 20 bucks is a steal from the regular 35) is nirvana, its a hardbook or textbook (whatever its called its superb) i havent read all into detail yet, but from the looks of it,its gonna be a keeper!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Wow that was cool because the jet pack. Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My only disapointment was that I could not get season 3 on Amazon Prime and had to buy it. When does season 4 start?
0062082353|5.0|This book was one of the best books I read in a long time but two I don't read much but I will read more if I could find more books on that line
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|I read this book in just over one sitting. It is a quick read; mostly because the bulk of the book is dialog and thoughts. The story was enjoyable and well communicated. I hadn't expected it to be a YA book. I probably would not have purchased it if I had realized that it was. It felt fairly limited in scope and depth of character, but did manage to make me remember some of the feelings that teenagers have. Overall, a nice read, but a little too simple. Books like this are a nice change of pace every once in a while though.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is my favorite book I have read the whole series and I loved it. This book is very suspenseful and exciting.
B001XUPD94|5.0|What can you say.  Any movie with the Star Trek name should go down as a great movie.  Roddenbery brought a new future to life with the Star Trek theme. They will live forever in our hearts and memories.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The editing in this movie wins. The editor keeps the pace and the story not only moves, it is thrilling. It won the Oscar. I did not see the competition, but I loved this movie.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|I love Downton Abbey! I watched season 1 on Netflix and was addicted, I needed to know what happens next and Netflix didn't have seasons 2 or 3. So that day I signed up for amazon prime!
B006HL9G10|5.0|I used the free version for about a year, then upgraded to the pro version when it was free, and regret that I didn't just pay up earlier. Pro has options to set intervals within the timer, which is handy for longer sittings and well worth a buck or three. I like that you can set the screen to dim, and ignore notifications automatically while in operation. Definitely had the most options for customization the last time I looked at timer apps. Additional bells are high quality, as in the lite version. No obtrusive visual aids - if you happen to practice Zen this is a plus. No issues using the app on a Moto Droid, Razr Maxx or Sony tablet.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I got a lot of information out of this book. I intend on putting the information to good use. Thank you.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you played Final Fantasy VII or any of its spin-offs and liked it, you will definitely enjoy this. The story of Cloud continues here, its a little confusing but its still a great story. There's plenty of action, and the cg animation is amazing. A definite must own for Final Fantasy VII fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an amazing and addictive game that's free & easy to play<br />Love it :) if your wondering to get this or not i advise you now GET IT!!!!
0062238868|5.0|Great inside look into the world of an elite Navy SEAL sniper and his experiences during OIF.  This book is truly easy to read since it's written as Chris Kyle were talking.  There are a lot of acronyms, but not enough to confuse the average civilian.  Having been there during the initial invasion I can attest to the extreme realism of his accounts...the smells, sights, and sounds especially.  I had intended on purchasing this book earlier, but just never did.  I wish I hadn't waited.  America lost a first class warrior and his family a first class husband and father.  RIP C.K.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I cant say enough great things about this CD. It surpasses any Metallica CD in the last 20 years and grooves you until you explode.  Great F-ing CD guys.  You are still metal/mosh Gods!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Bought as a gift and the children truly enjoy playing with the set and creating more than just the house pictured. Lego seems to have gone to specific items and thus costs more then when my children were young and we could purchase large quantities in Red boxes and let there imagination soar!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I saw this movie first at a drive-in and later got it on VHS.  I enjoy the quality of the DVD and the extras.  Thank you
B00AREIAI8|1.0|this stupid game wont install on kindle fire. don't waste your space.it gets stuck on 43% and wont go any further.
B001HRJG2S|5.0|Start to finish, this is the band's most interesting record showing just how far they've grown. Listen to the vinyl, the music really comes alive.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Elizabeth Haynes'  first novel is a winner! At first, it seemed a bit slow but really got going. I felt like Catherine's character was well developed and relatable especially considering all she had been through. The last hundred pages really had my pulse racing!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It is a fun game but with flaw of Constant pop up of to add new game which is never there and only way to get rid of page is go to my home base and reload game from there....after each game. would be terrific to either get rid of life junk or get it faster. It really is neat other than my 2 gripes.
034553154X|5.0|The artwork in this calendar is amaziny beautiful, and spot on.  The first time I flipped through it, I didn't even have to look at the titles to know what the painting represented.  Also, for people out there that gave this calendar negative reviews for the artwork being too violent or suggestive have obviously never read ASoIaF.  Watering down the material wouldn't have been a true depiction.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|this is an excellent concept and history album tells the struggles of my ancestors. we woulda won if our allys had just a little more bravery and heart like the great vercingetorix next album should be the story od boudicca the warrior queen of brittain.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Amazing game. I love it! The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't play music from the movie.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My 9 year old son and I use this every night to help go to sleep.  We used it in a hotel room recently and it was like sleeping at home.  Some of the white noise options are annoying (clock ticking, faucet dripping), but we have a few favorites that work well for us.  We also enjoy linking to the website included in the app that gives us more free options for different sounds (rain on tin roof is nice).
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I felt this book started out slow but once I got into it I could not put it down.  I am a loyal fan of Patricia Cornwell and always look forward to her next book.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We rarely spend much on apps, music, books or movies.  However, I did splurge on this movie.  It has been worth the money.  He has watched it several times already over a short period of time.  It's nice to have the movie on the kindle instead of worrying about a wi-fi connection.  I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie as well.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Well written, good story! You will not want to put the book down.... In some places there is over description of unnecessary details and it might be annoying but the overall experience is great!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  A teen romance with a twist.  Keep an open mind to the world of current day High School, and young adult situations.
B004I744AS|5.0|Gives me the edge when I need the the right word or the correct meaning.  Makes you literate and intelligent.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My husband already had the first two DVD's but desperately wanted the third - and in Blu Ray.  This was a HUGE hit at Christmas!
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|The movie tried too hard at preaching it's liberal message. The amount of foul language, blaspheming and disrespect towards Christians was not necessary nor did it ad to the comedic value to the movie. Clearly the writers/actors have some deep rooted bitterness in their lives. So sad for these intolerant extremist losers.
B000000132|5.0|To many, Turn of the Cards is the best of all Renaissance albums. And for fans of the group, the best of their work is truly high praise. Most of Renaissance's success is due to Mike Dunford, who has written quite a catalogue of amazing music that mostly goes overlooked. However, there's no overlooking the writing on Turn of the Cards. Starting with Mother Russia, likely Renaissance's greatest song, a prog rock triumph and genuinely moving  song. An ode to Russian dissident and author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the dirge-like refrain \\"red blood, white snow\\" captures his and others' bleak suffering.<br /><br />Running Hard begins with a dazzling John Tout piano solo. Jon Camp's bass joins in, and then in true bombast, Terry Sullivan's drums.  When Annie Haslam joins the fun with her taut driving vocal, the band is cranking at its best. I Think of You is simple but beautiful, with Dunford's shimmering and precise guitar work showing off Annie's vocals. Sullivan's drums riff give this piece a gentle rhythm, like a lullabye.<br /><br />Things I Don't Understand, written with Jim McCarty from the band's original line-up, is another classic, with the great refrain \\"we don't need to know the answers to hope and pray for peace.\\" Black Flame is goth before there was goth. Any goth fans out there should just get this song. So Cold is Being almost out-goths Black Flame. A rarity in rock - a piece for organ and voice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one the best apps ihave on Amazon appstore. I had no problems with it is kinda like templerun expept its a guy on the subway running away from the guard. You can get mestry boxes, coins and items to onlock charact.
0140282033|4.0|A wonderful, enchanting story about a mothers quest to put down roots for her daughter, and then realize that family love is as important as roots. The characters were rich and delightful to the imagination.
0670024813|4.0|Jared Diamond has never been one for the succinct or brevity and this exercise is getting to be a bit strained.  While the content of the book is excellent, it would well serve from heavy editing to compress the purpose of his vignettes into paragraphs, not pages.  This work does not stand up to the groundbreaking 'Guns, Germs, and Steel,' but to be fair, few other Anthropological work have even come close.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I loved this book. Once I was about 50 pages into it, I couldn't put it down. More of a mystery/thriller. I wasn't a big fan of the ending, but that's one of the great things about Gillian Flynn is that she doesn't always write your typical, expected, storybook ending.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I enjoy the competitive battles online. Awesome SIM game.Gameloft did it again, with Oregon Trail, Ice age and Kingdom & Lords, their simulated games rock!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game. I got it because another user said it was like Mario. It is similar for sure. I worry that pushing the screen in the same place repeatedly might hurt screen down the line. The game does have some annoying glitches. The jump button doesn't always work the way it should and sometimes it moves in slow motion. It doesn't dissuade me from playing however. I really enjoy the game and will keep on playing.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind does not dissapoint with this novel.  I love the Sword of Truth series and would definitely suggest anyone who likes good fantasy novels read them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have seen every season and each season seems to get better.  Looking forward to next season to see what will transpire.
B008220D7S|4.0|This was a funny movie, especially for someone getting close to being 40. Though I cannot say that I am in any type of a midlife crisis, I can empathize with the characters that were going through such a point in their life. The best part in my perspective though about this movie was the great acting that came with the actors that attach themselves to the movie itself. You have seen most of these factors before in other films, but they really brought out their A-game you it came to this movie. In the end, you truly see the strength of the relationship that is there between the main characters, and you can see that while they have gone through a crisis, it is definitely not the end. Overall, I was truly impressed with the balance of humor and humanity which I related to throughout the film.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|the movie was suspenseful and entertaining.  not too scary but would not recommend for kids under 13. the ending was unexpected.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|If you are a fan of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom/Mars series, this is an excellent film. The successful computerized presentation of beloved races and creatures is a joy - the calot, thoats, Thark and Warhoon, white apes and the twin towers of Helium are faithful to the books. It calls to mind other alien societies, like the film Serenity or Avatar, or fantasy series like Walkign Dead or Game of Thrones.<br /><br />If you are not a fan and coming to the planet as a new visitor, you have a good chance of liking the film. This is the series that pioneered a genre later exploited by Otis Albert Kline, Michael Moorcock, Ray Bradbury and others.<br /><br />If you are a consumer who thought &#34;Twilight&#34; was good movie making, you will not like it. It is a poor choice as a date flick, though most males will be drawn to Deja Thoris as a powerful warrior woman who is sexy as all get out.<br /><br />I believe Disney had no idea how to market the film, resulting in the wrong people being asked to review the film. They could connect, had no idea what came before, and could only measure it against the current hot-ticket date flicks. The bad reviews gave it bad word of mouth (usually from people who had no personal experience of the film, but depended on the predigested views of critics).<br /><br />I ordered this the week it became available as a pre-order on Amazone, it arrived faster than I expected and I have shared it with many people, all of whom had heard bad things from the critics, and all of whom loved the film, or at least enjoyed it.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I've done photography at the semi-professional level for over 20 years and love this app because it's very easy to use and handy for when I need to do quick editing on pictures on my portable devices when I don't have my camera with me. It gives great editing options for the price. I wish the blemish correction and color balance options were better, but you can't beat the value foe the price. Definite buy!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I really liked this app until right out of the blue it started requiring the Internet to run the app. That requirement makes it useless to me since I spend about 90% of my time on my kindle in places where there is no wireless available. The weird thing is that I used the calculator for months with no problem...and then suddenly it changed to make it useless. Well, you get what you pay for and I guess I will have to delete this one and look for a calculator that works in none connected areas.  Therefore I have dropped this to 2 stars.<br /><br />Update about 1 week later:  OK, now I am really confused.  The calculator now works without the internet again.  I have no idea why it gave me the \\"Internet Needed\\" error message and then suddenly stopped needing it all by itself.  In any event, I have increased the rating to three stars...I am not going back to my original thought that it was a 4 or 5 star app because of the irritation factor of not being able to use it for the week that it didn't work without internet.  If it does it again, I'll let you know.  If it doesn't, perhaps I will just consider it an aberration and increase the rating again.  We shall see.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a 5 star because the season is epic. The first three episodes are MIND BLOWING.  If you are considering the walking dead for the first time I suggest you find season 1, buy the seasons pass, and come back to season 3 when you have watched the other episodes.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show is so addictive (ha). We can't stop watching. Just counting the days until the 5th season is out.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A great read that give a bit more than your usual SEAL doc. does.<br /><br />Full of heart, devotion, courage and your usual dose of detailed descriptions.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have read all of the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid book and I think they are great. I recommend this book to all ages because it's just so funny. And if any one is looking for a comment like this week here it is...Yes,it is worth the money!!! So STOP WHAT YOUR DOING AND BUY THIS BOOK!!!
B008S80OU2|5.0|Awesome collection of Blue Oyster Cult's body of work for Columbia.  Many, but not all, of the CDs are re-mastered, with bonus tracks.  It's really interesting to listen to the CDs sequentially and trace the band's evolution from the black and white period, through a pop/commercial period to their mature sound.  There are 4 downloadable concerts that are really cool to listen to, as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game,faster,harder,and more tricks!I can't wait to by the New prizes and other stuff.The only thing I might not like is the point system,you don't gain points as fast as you used to.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I love it .. It work fine, I live it specially to open any apps from you phone, and play games it's the best.
B000O599ZS|5.0|great movie how can you not like John Wayne, all his<br />westerns are great to watch, the Searcher is one of my best.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game is another one I have to learn how to play and once I know how it looks like I will enjoy playing it.
0345529057|5.0|For George R.R Martin to create such an abstract piece of work says much about the writer. The song of Fire and Ice series is amazing, and to have such an extravagant story then portrayed on screen is like a dream come true to the reader.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This has been a fun game. I especially like the challenge of releasing the caged birds. Once I get used to playing I'm looking forward to the differant levels.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'll add my congrats to the long list of positive reviews for this book.  A fast moving adventure for one man, cast in a very believable near future situation, with science that moves well and doesn't jar the senses with impossible ideas.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Once I get the learn how to use this I will be so happy since I will be able to read my facebook anywhere I go.
1400069807|1.0|Salt was part of a Roman Soldier pay.  Hence, salary.<br />Sugar was infamous in the sugar/rum/slave trade and before the 18th century.<br />Fat has been recognized as flavorful since the caveman discovered fire.<br />Holland grew rich on the spice trade in the 17th century which had been under Venice's control earlier.<br /><br />I like butter.  I use lard in pie crusts.  I occasionaly sprinkle more sugar on my frosted mini wheats.  I put extra salt on my fries.  I eat what I wish in moderation.  I eat less of it now because I have a more sedentary life style, now that I am 72.  I carry average weight for my body style.  I like the occasional Cheetos and have had a 32oz soft drink. Please, don't shoot me!  Shoot those evil corporates that, evidently, are just finding out people like things that taste good.<br /><br />NOTE THAT MANY OF THE REVIEWS WERE BASED ON COMPED BOOKS!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is also fun to play. I need to play it more to get a better understanding on how to play it.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|I think this has to be the best video player app on the android market...Would highly recommend.easy functionality.and it is free
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|NOT MUCH ELSE NEEDS TO BE SAID, IT TRULY IS A CLASSIC I LOVED GROWING UP AND NOW MY DAUGHTER CAN ENJOY AS WELL, ITS TIMELESS
0316228532|2.0|I struggled to finish this (although I almost quit at least three times) just to see what this book was supposed to be about.  I loved the Harry Potter books and feel Ms. Rowling is brilliant, however, this is the most depressing and 'downer' book I've come across in a long time.  There was not one thing upbeat or made you feel good.  It was not for me but I'm glad I struggled through it so I can appreciate the other reader's comments and see different points of view.
0062267787|5.0|perfect for anyone who loves this series!! it is a combo of 3 short stories that go along with the series and they are just as awesome as the books themselves!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I won't say much, since there are many reviews extolling the virtues of this great film, except don't miss it!  It will amaze and uplift you and may even give you some perspective on your own life and what achievement and success really means!  Enjoy...I know you will!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|slow gameplay wish there was more interactive.  but it kinds fun<br /><br />dinosaurs should be varied bring in more of them escaping<br />um yeah that's it really just trying g to chill drinking vino listening to rush trying to make a portrait of my cats. boy they are frisky tonight. they keep making the most strangest sounds.<br /><br />Ommnjdhg help me &iexcl; MY CATS ARE TRYING TO KILL ME WITH CATNIP..

B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is one of the best shows that a non-network television  channel has created. Great story as soon as season 3 is available for preorder I will be ordering it
B00683JK9K|1.0|I am finished with this app.  I have lost a nearly finished puzzle three times.  Accessing a saved puzzle is a chore and the controls are terrible.  It is either frozen or flies through the pieces at lightning speed.  I might try again after an update.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was a great show that did not get to live up to its full potential. Fox should be ashamed that they let this one go. Hopefully Season 2 will be part of my collection one day.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I think a plague killed the makers cause I'm still waiting on the other expansions and I've had the game since we December. It's a fun game but expect anything new to come at a snail's pace.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a fun game but it is way to expensive. U cant make enough money to keep up with the game . The cost of  food is to high . The cost to remove trees  is too much . The makers of this game need to be more reasonable with the cost to this game and then it will be more enjoyable.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Reminds me of my own childhood. There definitely are perks to being a wallflower. I give it two thumbs up.
0062082353|5.0|I read some comments stating that its a horrible book and all that... Its an Autobiography and there may be some slang language or techniques used but this does not mean that its a horrible book.  Its very interesting descriptive I would recommend it!!!.. Its a book about an individual who really put his life on the line who was brought up in a family where honor and courage was unmistakably present. If you compare this book to the professionally written literature pieces and conclude that its a horrible book then you are a true idiot..

B00068TJM6|5.0|My first Seiko and the watch looks really good. As you can see the outer bezel is a slide rule and functions as you may expect it to, turns smoothly and is pretty accurate A good sized dedicated manual comes with the watch for the slide rule. As usual the left most inner dial is the regular seconds hand and the main seconds hand is integrated into the chronograph function. The top inner dial being the minute counter of the chronograph; the bottom dial is an alarm. REMEMBER the crown and buttons A & B are screw-down type. So if you receive your watch and panic that none of the buttons can be actuated, well the reason is because they are screwed down; simply unscrew them for use and back again to ensure your watch is water resistant. The black bezel and face are complemented by the clear white lettering and markings. The main hands and the hour markers are luminous and glow very quickly once exposed to light. The main seconds hand is really prominent as it is yellow on black (looks nice and immediately grabs your attention)  The watch has a curved (concave) crystal, it is not protected by the outer bezel, hence it may be prone to scratches, but I'm trying to avoid that as much as possible, being a little conscious of that fact will help the time piece to last longer. The band is quite sturdy with a locking clasp.<br /><br />Overall, great looking watch and quite pleased with the purchase; the seller was prompt in the shipping and arrived on schedule, thanks again.

0385535147|2.0|I have always loved Grisham....<br /><br />But this book lacks both content and style. You neither find the depth of legal research nor the complexity of a thriller. The entire complexity (which is quite little) only unravels as the main character does or speaks about things / events.<br /><br />The book is shallow. There is not a single moment which makes you stop and think. After some time, the only reason you want to complete the book is because you have started it and do not want to waste the entire effort.<br /><br />The book ends abruptly. Everything falls in place and they live happily ever after. The book lacks in all respects.

B002ZIAC26|4.0|Beach House emerged on the surface of my music collection late in the bands career. The first I heard of them was browsing Pitchfork, who connected them with sounding like Cocteau Twins, one of my favourite bands. Their music labelled under \\"dream pop\\" could be described with words such as ethereal, majestic, elegant, and charming. I did not think this style could have an equal twin so to speak, but like their music; listening to Teen Dream feels like being wrapped up in the world's biggest fluffy cloud whilst on a generous dose of diazepam.<br /><br />Except this is not so much Cocteau Twins as a new band with the lead singer having vocals entirely unlike Elizabeth Frazier. Her sounds are deeper and more defined but suit the lower production values with a simplistic approach to the tracking. Where Beach House really impress is in the progression and gradual higher definition of the chord structures being used. This is an album which does not grab your full attention on first listen, and demands repeated listens for full effect.<br /><br />Silver Soul relies on dissonance and sliding bottleneck guitar. This is the start to the album and actually sounds contrasting to the rest of Teen Dream in all it's catchiness. It's former, Zebra, has a gentle guitar lick which has a strange charisma about it, almost bereft of bass, whilst drum machines play and you actually picture horses galloping along to it.<br /><br />Walk In The Park begins with an organ playing a relaxed, almost sombre ditty, with Scally's tense, aching guitar licks moving in an out of the track until a slight chord change moves the song into spacey territory with trademark Robin Guthrie guitar enveloping around you.<br /><br />The greatest display of Beach House's writing comes on Lover Of Mine, which has two parts, verse/chorus repeated - and then breaks down into what can only be described as an orgasmic assault of intense emotions ranging from loss to overwhelming pleasure, which fades quickly and demands the listener repeat this adventure. It's also where the lead singer reaches her vocal pinnacle as she hits high notes and for a second sounds like Alison Goldfrapp.<br /><br />The closing of Teen Dream changes the setting somewhat with Real Love, a fairly non-dreamy effort, but still soothing somewhat.<br /><br />This is often recognised as Beach House's best album, although I have to disagree as Bloom is overall a more consistent album throughout. Teen Dream's only critique from me is the last quarter does not match up to the former. Never-the-less, this is still essential listening for fans of dream pop and one where Beach House cement themselves in the genre above so many.<br /><br />4/5ds the listener repeat this adventure.

B0047SF41G|3.0|Okay, let's start with the good.<br />-I really, honestly liked one of the characters. The Spetsnaz guy, we'll call him Boris. His gentle giant demeanor, which is entirely opposite of what you'd expect from a trained killer, really got through to me. The way he's always so concerned for the rest of the group, the way he mentors the doctor a little...he's really a great guy. However, the second I saw him looking at a scrap of paper, I cringed. I knew what it was, but he felt the need to show us anyway. It's a picture of his kids. And just like that, I knew he was dead, as sure as if he'd signed his own execution order. Five minutes later, he died.<br />-The way the Predators were individualized a bit was nice, even if it was only by helmet design.<br />-Never saw the betrayal coming at the end, even though I recognized the Chekhov's Neurotoxin introduced in the early stages of the movie. In hindsight, shoulda seen it coming, though. After all, what kind of doctor keeps a number of small, sharp objects on him at all times? Dexter, that's who.<br />-The concept of the movie was in fact interesting.<br /><br />And, on to the bad.<br />-Everybody else in the merry band. There was no background provided. No character development.<br />-For a group of Ultimate Badasses, they were absolutely terrible shots. Really. The dogs, running head on at them, and they somehow miss with about all of their bullets. There is in fact a part where Boris, love him though I might, misses one of those dogs at five meters, with a minigun. Seriously. Hoses the area down for a full ten seconds, zero hits. He also fails to massacre Royce and Senor Lopez right there in the beginning. Sure, it would be bad for the storyline, but then again, SPETSNAZ WITH A MINIGUN.<br />-The Predators turned out to be pussies. Yakuza Boy hacks one up with a damn katana. No shit. Boris commits suicide by claymore mine, because the Predator couldn't kill him properly with the plasma cannon. Super-Rapist survives getting blasted at point blank range, and then shanks the hell out of the Big Bad.<br />-The Predator .v. Predator scene was completely useless. I understand that they needed to get rid of the little guy somehow, but that was not the way.<br />-Also, where was the rest of the little guy's tribe? For real.<br />-The IDF girl, who I can only assume has to be Mossad, lacks the cold, detached feeling so typical of Mossad field agents. Easy Hollywood mistake, but a mistake nonetheless.<br />-I straight up hated Royce. Truly, I did.ting blasted at point blank range, and then shanks the hell out of the Big Bad.<br />-The Predator .v.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful follow up to the first book I can't wait to see where book 3  leads Ana & her fifty!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am still trying to process this trilogy. The author is obviously inexperienced  and it took some time to adjust to the first person narrative, which felt like reading a diary. On the other hand, maybe the writing style-- with all the dry humor-- is what makes Ana and Christian linger as if they're real people... strange, when the story is not totally believable. The author realized Christian needed to be beautiful,very fragile,and very young for readers to empathize with him rather than view him as twisted (he should've been at least 30, though, being that he'd reached billionaire status). Some say the book encourages abusive relationships but consensual adult interactions are not the same thing as abuse; we're talking primal instincts and if two adults like dramatic/enhanced encounters, how does that fall under abuse? The writing was very repetitive and the books too long, yet the final installment ended abruptly and was somehow disjointed, leaving the reader wanting more. This is my first 'erotica' book so it's hard to compare but I can say Ana and Christian are much more memorable than the usual characters in a generic 170 page romance. Perhaps by lingering on their thoughts, EL James took the time to make these characters three dimensional  and I now find myself unable to connect to characters in shorter generic romances.... mostly because, although Grey was, by his own admission, \\"fifty shades of screwed up\\", he was openly loving and affectionate toward Ana and the connection was tangible. So, despite her somewhat amateur writing style, James was able to convince the reader that Christian was truly in love with Ana to the point where his life was saved-- something romance fans want to believe about true love. Add in a traumatic background and an abundance of erotic scenes and you have the magic of Fifty Shades. Honestly, Grey's control issues would be suffocating and difficult to overcome in real life but I guess most women would be willing to fight for a manwho is loving, beautiful, rich, fragile, sensual, an amazing lover and hopelessly in love with her. Who wouldn't compromise for such a dreamy, if unrealistic, package? All I know is that this trilogy affects the reader much more than a typical romance and if you are female, FSoG will leave you wishing for Christian Grey.

I did before I figured out  that's what they were. Only downside is that you have to buy more hints if needed. A suggestion to the developers would be to award more hints for a certain number of games played, or a certain amount of time spent in game.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The plot was very complex and this was an excellent read.  I was very happy to see that there were two follow-on books.  I really enjoy long and complex plots and multi book series.  There was a little of everything in this book.  This book should be made into a movie in english.  I tried watching the foreign movie but with the subtitles but it lost a lot --the book details always get lost.
B00B780TAK|5.0|Having never seen or even heard of the show until this year, I was curious to see what all the hype was about.  My last five weeks was spent recuperating from surgery and I thought it the perfect opportunity to download Season 1 of the show.  Immediately, I was hooked and just finished Season 3 last night! I loved everything about it...the time period, the interplay between the servants and the family, the characters, story line,  the attention to detail in the house,  and the clothing of the time period.  I am, admittedly now, a Downton Abb-ict!  Cant wait for Season 4!
B009EJSUBY|5.0|Van Cliburn is, hands down (pardon the pun), the greatest pianist that America has ever produced.  His musical lineage goes through his mother, Rildia Bea, who was a student of Arthur Friedheim, who was a student of Liszt, who was a student of Czerny, who was a student of Beethoven, who was a student of Haydn and (briefly) Mozart.  (Sounds biblical, doesn't it?  &#34;And Haydn begat Beethoven, ... &#34; -- perhaps it really was a miracle!)  Sadly, he passed away on Wednesday, Feb. 27, after a two-year bout with bone cancer.<br /><br />I saw Van Cliburn in concert four times in the 1970's and 1980's, at the end of his &#34;first&#34; performing career, and the beginning of his &#34;second phase&#34;.  Contrary to popular opinion, he did not lose his touch, and he certainly did not lose his connection with audiences.  All of the concerts I attended (two were open-air concerts, each one after a thunderstorm in Texas, attended by 50,000-plus music lovers), ended with 10-minute standing ovations, as well as numerous encores by a man who never forgot the meaning of humility and human warmth, despite all his accomplishments (2 Grammy Awards, the Tchaikovsky Competition, the Leventritt Competition).  He was the epitome of charm and humanity.<br /><br />I have heard performers in every field, from classical, to rock and roll, to blues, to jazz, to even (sorry to admit it ) rap.  Cliburn was the supreme entertainer, unchanged by fame and fortune.  He had a way to communicate through music; he was the last of the true, great,  Romantic-inspired performers.<br /><br />I've read that he chose not to release enough material to fit on at least one album -- including all four Chopin ballades.  He performed the Mozart Concerto #25 in C, K503, in a live concert with Bernstein (along with other works).  Also, he recorded at his home, scores of works, perhaps.  One intriguing piece is a work he composed called &#34;Nostalgia&#34; which his producer begged him to release.  Is there anychance, I wonder, if these recordings will be released in the future?  I know that many fans long for these recordings.<br /><br />My salute, again, to the last of the truly great artists!<br /><br />In any case, he will be missed.  He single-handedly awakened a resurgence of classical music in the US, and changed so many lives, including my own, with his heart-felt interpretations and super-human technique.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|We read wwz in my book club and I didn't know what to expect, but I ended up liking it! Dozens of bite-sized stories weave in and out giving you a multi-faceted view of the &#34;historical timeline&#34; of the war. The stories were sometimes poignant, and often interesting, with touches of humor.<br /><br />Three stars not four because a lot of the stories were pretty absurd. And not because of the zombies. Absurd as in...absurdly simplistic dime store geopolitical philosophy. E.g. The Kuwait story, the celebrities in America story, the evil Phalanx capitalist story... It's not that the messages were wrong, but the brush strokes were so broad and the morals so didactic.<br /><br />That said, I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun plane/beach/book club read. I enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. There is so much saddened and death, but it pulls you in. I never liked the capitol in the first place, what they do is just wrong.

0061992860|3.0|This book definitely has great info in it, there's no doubt about that. The only thing is: Does it have to be so tiny? I understand that some want a tiny book to pack away in a backpack but I really wish there was a larger version out there. That would warrant 5-Stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. There was no doubt about it. I did feel bad for Katniss when she lost Peeta for that little while. But in the end, it all worked out with those two, Katniss and Peeta. She may have lost Prim, her Father, Finnick, they all lost some loved ones. But she lost Gale, well sort of I won't spoil anything. Five stars definitely, but read the first two books before this one.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is super useful. I like how it tells you how much time you can do certain activity before the battery runs out, how much time it needs to charge both by wall outlet and usb, what apps are wasting you're battery, and get a warning sound when you're battery has gotten to a low point.<br />I use this app along with my &#34;Timer4me & stopwatch&#34;....I simply see how much time I have until the battery is fully charged. Set the timer for that amount of time and go do whatever else I have to do or take a nap. That way, I don't have to be constantly looking at the percentage or the light to turn green (which does not mean it's fully charged). This app will always stay on my kindle.

B00ARX2W24|5.0|I was so into the single ROUTE 101 when it came out in 1982 and followed through to FANDANGO, but for some reason, the album did not make it into my collection.  Total shame, since I've been looking for this one for years to hear the entire thing.  I was hoping the Herb Alpert Signature Series would not stop at RISE.  The entire FANDANGO album is superb.  Though listed as a solo Herb Alpert effort, it is definitely a tribute to the days with the Tijuana Brass, and reflects the 20th anniversary of when Herb saw his first bullfight in Mexico, which started things rolling with THE LONELY BULL in 1962.  The signature tunes are ROUTE 101 and FANDANGO, but all tracks are top notch on this album.  The sound is pristine and all Herb fans will enjoy this update very much.  I'm delighted that this album is finally back in print.  An absolute must.
B005POK858|3.0|I don't expect as much from a cell phone game in comparison to, say, Nintendo ds or psp games.  But this game was lacking in comparison to Symphony of Eternity (soe), another jrpg by the same developer.  Other than having better graphics, this game is weaker in almost every important way: weaker story, weaker characters, less in depth gameplay.  There are also some turnoffs like too many random battles (in SOE you could see enemies on the map).  To be fair, perhaps some folks do not mind the random battles.  The one area I had hoped would be improved over SOE was the battle animations, but this was left the same.  Overall, there is nothing terribly wrong with this game.  But there is also nothing exciting or awesome about it.  Competent, average, predictable.  Fans of jrpg's will probably want to rate it one star higher, though.
0425252868|5.0|One pilot has another pilot's life in his hands and instead of shooting down the plane dispassionately decides to extend grace to the crew, to the extent of even putting himself in jeopardy by protecting the plane as it flies over anti-aircraft gun emplacements. That this is a true story is amazing, and that these two men lived through the war and found each other is incredible.  This is a must read...for anyone.

1596680296|5.0|I learned how to knit years ago and, as of late, have switched primarily to crochet.  However, I wanted to renew my old interest in knitting, and socks felt like the best way to go - knitted socks have better elasticity than crocheted socks, and the small number of stitches helps the rows to go by quickly.  Plus, it's very difficult to find colorful store-bought socks that actually fit my husband's feet.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by my aunt to get my start on this adventure, and I can already see why.  The author takes time to explain all the ins and outs of socks, practically preempting every question you might have along the way.  The initial tutorial walks you through a sample knitted sock on big yarn and needles so you pace your way slowly through each step from cuff to toe, with additional detailed articles on variations you could put at each step.  Every instruction is clear, patient, and informative.<br /><br />After this practice sock, the author provides 5 generic sock patterns based solely on yarn weights/gauges that you'll use on your sock-knitting adventures, with a range of sizes from child's small to adult's large for each one.  Then, once all that is done, she provides several complete patterns that deal with colors, cables, and lace in your patterns, as well as stitch samples for you to experiment with on your own.<br /><br />It's a very friendly introduction to knitters who are teetering on the brink of wanting to make that first pair of socks but balk at the thought of gussets and toes.  I'm looking forward to this wonderful resource being a part of my library for a very long time.
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has created a monumental piece of art. And yet, it is all about a monumental scientific discovery! As well, it is all about a poor young woman and her poor family. This is a book about all things of life! Perhaps, more particularly about American life and aspects of it most of us are less familiar with than we should be. To try to think of everything that Dr. Skloot has woven into her astounding book is not only to be profoundly affected, but is to learn about so many things you not only did not know, but could not have imagined. After reading her powerful tribute to Henrietta Lacks, one is left with no less than a sense of awe, appreciation, and admiration for the author.  But, also for Henrietta for lessons of living-and-giving we learn from her.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Batman Begins & The Dark Knight were good for what they are. However, the Dark Knight Rises is dull & dumb movie to watch with it's collection of plot holes & bad directing decisions. It left me with many unanswered questions seen below?<br /><br />What's with all the horrible sound quality? Sometimes, this film is louder than most anyone can possible be. Sometimes, this film is so low that your own thoughts seem to sound louder than this film.<br /><br />What Happened to the Joker?<br /><br />Why did the director think this was a good idea to make Batman basically handy capped (...seriously)? Batman has trouble fighting because of an apparent bad leg (possibly an injury from fighting the Joker in the last film). Even with a new robotic brace helps Batman move his leg, Batman still has trouble doing much anything in general. Bruce also looks like he didn't aged at all after the last film, but the plot description for this film says that this movie (The Dark Knight Rises) is apparently set 8 years after the last Batman movie (the first Dark Knight) that Batman is kicking so much butt in.<br /><br />Why is the fighting of this movie so bad & almost non-existent in general?<br /><br />Why was Bruce (Batman) and Selina's (CatWoman's) love so randomly and quickly formed?<br /><br />Why didn't they ever call Selina Kyle, &#34;CatWoman?&#34;<br /><br />Why doesn't Bane take the Venom drug or anything like it to gain superhuman strength (and therefore has no real powers)?<br /><br />Why is Bane have a new big weak spot  (His own entire head)? Bane's mask holds together much of his head which prevents Bane from otherwise feeling much extreme pain and possibly dying. Destroying the mask means destroying Bane.<br /><br />Why does Bane talk with that rediculous voice? Truthfully, Bane's silly voice takes away from Bane's sense of being scary or dangerous. Bane talks like an old dork trying to badly sound like Sean Connery doing German accent and failing at the impression. Also,Bane is lame next to the Joker of this series (R.I.P. Heath Ledger).<br /><br />Why is Robin a cop named Blake?<br /><br />How does Blake figure out Batman's identity at all?<br /><br />Why doesn't Blake become Robin in the middle or throughout the movie?<br /><br />What's with all the tacked-on orphan stuff?<br /><br />Why is Bruce's place turned into an orphanage?<br /><br />Also, is the director trying to say that Robin is going to replace Batman entirely as the hero of Gotham with this movie's ending?<br /><br />Why did Bruce change his mind about not wanting to have any partners (like Catwoman & Blake aka Robin)?<br /><br />Why did I waste 2 hours & 44 minutes of my life watching this slow & crappy movie?<br /><br />What Happened? This movies seems to be made by a different studio. That may have something to do with it, but Christopher Nolan still directed all 3 films (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight & this film, The Dark Knight Rises).<br /><br />In any case, The Dark Knight Rises was a horrible Batman movie. It's plot is basically a very lacking & poorly written version of the plot from the Batman game, Arkham City (available for PlayStation 3 and X-Box 360). It's full of plot holes & is just annoying to watch.<br /><br />Get the first 2 Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan. Don't even waste you time with the third film. After all, you could always play Arkham City.

0312330863|5.0|You laugh, you cry, you fall in love with the vet and his life on the moors of England.  Always a pleasure till the last page.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is soooooo cool! this app has show jumping and every thing!!!!! plus u chose ur horse tack and clothing!
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. I say was because it only took a week to ace it out. The price was right, free, the game play was straight forward and with a little work easy to master.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've been playing this game for a long time - it's still fun and is still challenging. My grade school son likes it too - a fun way to practice logic puzzles.
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|We ordered this item before it was released.  The price was approximately $28 but when it was shipped we had received two reductions in price which saved us almost $8.  Great product and price guarantee.
B005HEPIDS|4.0|After getting by the Cap. Janeway's name, which I guess I never did, it had a good story line. Watched the whole series.
B000002KJM|5.0|Blistering debut album from ZZ Top. The first album shows the band in all there power trio glory! Live and rocking is what you get on this disc.  I loved this one from the moment I put it on. I had skipped on purchasing this disc for years because of all the complaints about the mastering. But I picked it up for $5.00 and was very happy with it. It definitely lacks the power of the Fandango and Tres Hombres reissues from the original tapes that Rhino did a few years back. But the sound quality of this one was much better than the Rio Grande Mud release. The sound quality of that release was disappointing at best! But the first album is warm and good sounding and since it looks like we will never see those reissues from Rhino of the rest of the catalog this is as good as it is going to get. Put it up and rock with ZZ top's first album.
0618001905|5.0|well worth reading if you are interested in colonialism in Africa.  The brutality described is shocking but I gues not surprising considering the rest of human history.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is awesome!!!!! It is so fun!!!! You have to buy it!!!! I love the wizard monkey! it pops a lot of bloons!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept me on pins and needles. I would recommend this book. A great romance story.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is the best book about the WWII air war that I've read.  Author was very thorough in his research and provides little known  facts.  Along with the facts, Makos describes the emotions of both pilots go through during and after the war.
B00280LYHS|5.0|These books are fun to read.  I am reading then with my daughter who loves the characters.  She finds little pieces of herself in each character!
1451624468|3.0|Good book! Extremely well written. Dr. Krauss has a way with words that I find rather uncommon in those who typically express themselves numerically rather than verbally. Where I differ with Dr. Krauss is in regard to the question of the `externality' of God. For Dr. Krauss, it appears that God is external to the universe; whereas I see God as integral to the universe.<br /><br />This issue was addressed, and in my opinion definitively resolved, long ago in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. God is not up there or out there somewhere. He is in our midst, and that is where He is to be found. That is precisely the message, the `good news' if you will, of Christianity.<br /><br />One can certainly understand why a cosmologist might be disposed to look upward and outward for deity but in my view Dr. Krauss is looking in the wrong direction, and the god he finds out there is little more than a straw man.<br /><br />I believe that our God is defined by whatever it is that we aspire to become, and we find that meaning and fulfillment through our relationships with nature (through science if you will), with ourselves and with our fellow man. And frankly I believe the realization of these possibilities within ourselves is every bit a quantum process.<br /><br />On page 183 Dr. Krauss writes: \\"Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant.\\" To my way of thinking, in a world without miracles religious belief becomes more and more important and more and more relevant.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Fun for all ages!  A good way to learn your Greek mythology! Each book gets better and better! My daughter begs for more chapters
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Very good book but at time it seems to spend a lot of time on cabinet member. I see  no purpose in going into Chase's daughter's wedding in such detail
B00280LYIC|5.0|Fun for all ages!  A good way to learn your Greek mythology! Each book gets better and better! My daughter begs for more chapters!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Good writing with good descriptions of varied time periods  and sites.  The story was a mystery until the very end and satisfactory for all.  I enjoyed it very much.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed this film. It is a lot of fun to watch. There is flaws as there are in every movie, but who cares?
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I had high expectations for this movie, as I thought the previews were hilarious. Unfortunately, the previews were the only funny parts from the movie. Save yourself some time and watch something else.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It made more sense than the Stalone version. The grahics were better, and there was a decent plot structure. Not a great movie since the plot is still weak.
0307591549|5.0|The book is an easy read with great stories and plenty of humor.  But the practical steps Mr. Achor provides help you put the principles in motion for yourself.  This is going on my &#34;annual reading list&#34; of books worth re-reading.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie had good graphics, but there was some odd changes to the plot line. The world inside the earth did not make sense because of the sun in the sky. Plus, why would gravity suddenly invert?
B000002KGT|1.0|my computer could not read when I tried to plat it. I would try reinserting it into the computer frontwards, backwards, slowly and nothing.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|The ending was terrible. It leaves so many questions and uncertainty. What happened after the wall fell? Who gets power in Portland? What happens with Hana? How does the loss of Raven affect the group? What is Julian's reaction to Lena choosing Alex. What does Coral do when she finds out about Lena and Alex? And why the heck is Alex even brought back in this book when he is just a tease of a character? This is not a good way to end a trilogy. There needs to be another book with answers. You don't just end a book during a war. I had been waiting for this book for a long time, and now I'm disappointed I even wasted money on it.
B00000G3I2|5.0|A film I have watched many times. Loaned my previous dvd on several occasions. The last time it didn't make it back and needed a replacement for my collection. An entertaining anthem for a generation. Superb cast and direction. Will always believe the \\"baby thing\\" was unnecessary to the story line and a needless distraction.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I ordered this movie for my nephew who wanted to see the original &#34;Grease&#34; as he was in the play.  Although he said that it was a bit different, he did enjoy it as well. I, myself, have always enjoyed watching &#34;Grease&#34;.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This device does exactly what it says. However, there are consumers' expectations. You cannot possibly expect this thing  to stabilize your shots as if it was a fly cam. The construction is sturdy. Another reviewer called it \\"rubbish\\", but, be reasonable, it is $20, not a $200 stabilizer mount.<br /><br />I deducted one star because it is too small to fit a large body DSLR or a Regular DSLR (T3i) with a battery grip.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone that makes amateur videos and wants a better grip for a camcorder or small DSLR.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|this series is witty, entertaining, and hilarious, i cant tell you how much i wish this was one that had gone on for 10 or more years, the cast is incredibly well chosen!!  thanks joss whedon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I first thought I wouldn't like this game because I thought it was for little kids, but it isn't. I love playing this game!!!!!!! I currently have a horse named Athena. I would recommend this app to horse lovers like me, and anyone who likes caring for animals.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|this movie is hilarious, with its very witty writing and a cast to match, it is more than entertaining, the captain for one is an eyeful and the story is sooo good i cannot believe there wasnt a sequel, well we can keep hoping!!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I am a fan of good singing and light hearted movies in general, and this was a stand-out along those lines.  The story line is fun, and the music is very moving.  The finale was off the wall for me!  I loved this movie so much, that I bought the soundtrack, and watched all the extras on the discs.  If you want a fun evening watching a 'feel good' movie, this one won't let you down!

B008RXYOKY|4.0|It did what I wanted it to do, namely to allow me to use my Thunderbolt port on my computer & it freed up a USB port.  Win-Win.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Good luck with the entire process and the entire process of the best possible to see what happens when you think of a great deal
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The writer took you on a journey through a hostile alien invironment.  In my minds eye, thru the talents of the writer, I lived thru what the main character experienced as well.  I would recommend this well written book to anyone wishing to read simply for the pleasure of reading.  Well written and well told.  Expect this to be made into a full length feature presentation on HBO one day.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Better than I thought it would be<br />This from some one who read all of the MAZE running book<br />Malachi
B00785P2QC|5.0|1 of my favorite games to play of this kind. not many peak my interest but the challenge involved is captivating.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|I love Sinatra and just listening to him brings on relaxtion and joy.  A real one of a kind. The setting and the sound and the jokes, all of it, brings back another time in our world of entertainment.
B0000039QA|4.0|My boyfriend purchased this as a gift for someone. He loved it and the free MP3 download was a bonus as well.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Immediately, I thought that Javier Bardem was in this film as the father character.  I guess it's really Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a \\"poor man's\\" Bardem, although Mr. Morgan is pretty good here, at least with what he has to work with.<br /><br />Why is it that nowadays, most male leads in film have to be these overly sensitive whimps?  It's actually getting a little irritating and distracting.  And this trend continues here with Mr. Morgan's character.  Yeah, he's strong I suppose when he needs to be, but for the most part, he just lays down and allows the rest of the cast -- mostly female -- to dominate the story.  I'm sure that this is the way that the director wanted it, perhaps to pull in more of a female audience, but that doesn't mean that I had to like it.  Where's Javier when we need him, the guy in \\"No Country for Old Men\\"?  Now THAT was a strong male character.  OK, you're right; perhaps he was a little too strong.<br /><br />But besides this major complaint, this film is actually pretty decent.  The possession scenes are actually pretty scary, and I jumped a few times when I expected members of the family to get whacked.  And I really liked the idea that the exorcist character was Jewish.  After all, Satan is an equal-opportunity destroyer.  Why do the Christians get to have all the fun?<br /><br />What's the theme of the movie?  Well, I'm not exactly sure.  But I can give you a couple of morals.  1.  Don't put your hand in the cookie jar.  It may ruin more than just dinner.  2.  Don't dial and drive.  You might get more than just a ticket.<br /><br />Probably more like a 3.5, but I'll round up today since I had a few good frights and I was mostly entertained.  But can we get some strong male leads again already?
034580404X|5.0|I love this book. It is very intense and a great erotica. It came very quick as well, which is always great.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Really nice after hard reading for work or college. Reading w/ my 13 yr old...so we can see the movies.
0385751532|5.0|This arrived just as they said it would as matter of fact got it earlier then expected.W hich was awesome.
B002VWNICW|5.0|This is a classic romance story that is not a tear jerker. I can watch it over and over. It is about breaking the mold of a class consious society. There are some good values in this movie. It has become my favorite movie.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Works great every time. I would recommend this app to everyone. Very simple to use. This app is very easy to download and install.
B000JIN3J8|1.0|The photo & review were for the version with Colin Firth. This version predates that by 20 years. It was atrocious. I stooped watching before the first dance.

B0013ND30M|5.0|I bought this movie for my 3 year granddaughter and she loves it!  She is all into princesses and Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora are her favorite.  A lovely story with a happy ever after ending.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Definitely an amazing album. As an almost 15 year RATM fan, I can say that I still highly enjoy their music even now. I've listened to this multiple times since buying it, and it still amazes me every time. A definite must-have.
0062238868|5.0|Have just started reading the book as I purchased the book for my husband and had to wait until he finished it. He said it was very informative and really enjoyed it.
B006HL9G10|4.0|On Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot; I heard no popping sound that others mentioned; the pop when the speaker turns on may be device specific, and were it my kindle doing that, I would call Kindle support.  The app opened the first time while I had wireless off and operated fine. When I later enabled internet, then the map appeared. The list of people meditating only includes those who have deliberately signed in to the app's network, not just anyone with the program and a facebook app; very non-invasive, and what I wanted to know.<br /><br />The sound would play along with an audiobook I had going as an experiment, without any 'argument'. I very much like that the volume levels for the individual bells can be individually set separate from the system volume. I do like that the timer continues to run when I go to the Fire home screen or access settings; I do not like that the bells do not sound if I am anywhere other than the running timer screen. Any other sound producing app I have continues to function while doing other things, including turning the Fire 'off' - a very useful feature which prevents accidental button presses and preserves battery life. While one is unlikely to be using other android features while meditating, this peculiarity of this timer limits its other possible usefulness to timing only off-device activities.  I also was not impressed with the hide display function as it only 'erased' the timer's display, the Fire's display was still active though dimmer and likely using almost as much battery; also once hide the display was chosen within the running timer there was no way to make it stop auto-dimming the Fire without stopping the timer. I suggest the developer figure out how everyone else manages to allow their sounds to keep playing when a device is 'off' and make that work instead.
B005FDXT32|5.0|I absolutely love this movie not only was it great when it came out but it's even better in Blu-Ray trust me it's AMAZING.....
0375851569|5.0|Gave this set of books to my son and his wife for their new baby. He felt the paper quality was fine.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|These movies are awesome, not only is it a trilogy but the price is incredibly fantastic I gave my dad this gift and he was in love with it and it worked well he LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|i bought this not for a kindle hd, but to charge my Samsung GS2 and Nexus 7 as well as my regular Kindle... and I bought  it because it said it would charge them faster than regular cords, (would &#34;turbo-charging&#34; be a correct appropriation here?), and that is indeed what it does.  it charges the bejeezus out of my things.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|this movies is actually very good but I will recommend not to watch with the kids could be some scenes that could be too strong but it's really good. a lot of violence
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I was never really a fan of mahjong but after playing this I am hooked !! I'm so hooked I purchased the addition.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|this movie is really good and the special effects are just great as well and I just saw it 3D and it's great!!! get it
B009CGYO0K|4.0|One of the funniest books I've ever read. I'm pretty sure my cats want to kill me. If you like funny comics you'll love this. The only issue was paying so much for such a short book. Cat lover's beware after reading thisbook.
0316224588|5.0|Rebus is back! Ian Rankin has appeased his fans and decided that, on the 20th anniversary of John Rebus’s appearance in the United States, he would bring him out of retirement. The detective finds himself floundering and decides to go to the cold case unit, known as the Serious Crime Review Unit (SCRU). He is not a cop anymore and has none of the authority he used to have. But he doesn’t seem to recognize this fact.<br />Siobhan Clarke also returns. She has been promoted to a Detective Inspector in the cold case unit and is doing very well. Rebus, of course, barrels into her office and life in the ways he used to. He acts as though he is still a DI, much to her chagrin and the evil eye of her boss. “No urgent cases required his attention: he worked with the long dead, murder victims forgotten by the world at large. There were eleven investigations on the books of the SCRU.” Some of the long gone go back to the 1940s.<br />Rebus is a rogue cop. He bends the rules, pushes the boundaries of his investigations, and now, as a civilian with wild ideas, he seems out of control. But a woman whose daughter has disappeared near the A9 roadway has been “pestering” the police to listen to her story. She tries to convince them that several girls have vanished in this same place. Rebus listens and convinces the boss of MisPer to open the case again.<br />Rebus has not changed a bit, and Siobhan slowly moves into his space and becomes his ally in the face of his old enemies. She is nervous that her very “proper” boss will see that she is helping Rebus. She has been told more than once in her career that being Rebus’s protégé will only blacken her future as a copper.<br />As Rebus combs cold case files, he is still a pub man, and his old enemies do catch up with him. His former nemesis, &#34;Big Ger&#34; Cafferty, has now become a drinking partner. They haven’t forgotten the past, but at the moment no conflicts exist between them. And there is a new enemy on the scene, Malcolm Fox, of the Internal Affairs Division. He hates Rebus and is looking for any excuse to throw him out of the MisPer unit.<br />STANDING IN ANOTHER MAN’S GRAVE is one of Ian Rankin’s richest books. He still limns his characters in such a way that readers can practically see them in the flesh. The twists and turns here are certainly remarkable; they come at the reader seemingly out of nowhere to jolt the soul. He also manages to infuse Rebus with his old wit and savvy thinking. A soundtrack is always in the background in these novels, and this one has plenty of rhythm. Fans will be truly satisfied with this much-deserved return and can only hope that Rankin has a few more Rebus mysteries in him.<br /><br />Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This app is awesome!My friend told me about it, and I don't think it would be good, but it was!We did a book called Dear Levi, amazing,about the Oregon Trail.So get this app!
B00B780TAK|5.0|I LOVE this series,it's a must see!!! Love all the characters! I was very skeptical about it at first, but once you learn the characters, you start to understand why they behave the way they do, and you stop hating them LOL
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm actually really impressed. This game is fun, addictive, and easy to learn and navigate. So far so good. The only thing I would change is some of the monologue. Its a little cheesy sounding.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app cause you get all the versions of the bible and for those that study the bible it is the best. Not only can you read the word you can listen to the word you can also set up a reading plan and it will remind you to read the bible everyday.

B008JFUNAU|3.0|Directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead), Oz: the Great and Powerful stars James Franco as Oscar Diggs (Oz), a mediocre circus magician that is swept up in a Kansas tornado and dropped in the Land of Oz.  After his arrival in Oz, Oscar is told by three different witches that he’s the prophesized wizard that’s meant to restore order to the Land of Oz and defeat The Wicked Witch of the West (Mila Kunis) and her evil sister, The Wicked Witch of the East (Rachel Weisz).  With the help of the Good Witch, Glinda (Michelle Williams), Oz must find a way to restore order and defeat the evil witches before they enslave the good people of Oz.  Zach Braff and Joey King lend their voices for the film, while Tony Cox and Bill Cobbs also serve in supporting roles.<br /><br />Despite the fact this film relies too much on CGI (and we will get to that), not everything is bad about this new re-imagination of Oz.  In fact, it’s quite the enjoyable film – starting with the cast.  Now, he’s no Judy Garland, but James Franco is a surprisingly good fit for the role of Oscar Diggs (The Wizard), with his sly charm and ulterior motives.  This is a character that hasn’t found his way yet, but he’s clearly searching to be something more than he is – a relatable trait for many of us.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, Michelle Williams has always done a tremendous job of playing the “girl next door,” so she fits in perfectly as the innocent, good witch.  On the other hand, both Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis made for two incredibly lackluster witches.  Kunis does her best Wicked Witch of the West impression, but falls so far short of the mark that you can’t help but hope she’s recast in the event of a sequel (which already has a green light, if the box office numbers are promising).<br /><br />Casting aside, the visual effects were just downright disappointing and overused.  The colors were beautiful, but they just didn’t flow properly with this fairy tale.  Perhaps, that’s just the classic Wizard of Oz holding me back.  Yes, this film was a perfect candidate for 3D, with all of its wild flowers and flying monkeys, but having an abundance of CGI ALWAYS takes away from the story – not to mention it’s uncomfortable to see an actor (Franco) trying to imagine tiny CGI water fairies biting your leg.  Don’t feel bad Mr. Franco, this is one of the biggest problems in film today.  In any event, the film’s beginning (20 minutes or so) was the most notable due to the throwback black and white 4:3 aspect ratio.  For a few minutes there, it actually felt like Kansas in 1905.<br /><br />Even though this film is entertaining, the film itself currently stands for everything wrong in the land of movies.  By no means is this film an outstanding achievement of any kind, but it does manage to throw in a few references to the classic film.  Unfortunately, the film serves only one purpose:  to feed the money-hungry Hollywood beast by using the good name of The Wizard of Oz.  If nothing else, perhaps watching Oz: the Great and Powerful will inspire a new generation to watch one of the greatest films of all-time, the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C+<br />FNDNreview.comrhaps, that’s just the classic Wizard of Oz holding me back.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really liked the spin on marriage part about this book, it was a nice twist. Kind of like having an arranged marriage. Only in this one the bride and groom benefit not the parents.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|Great game except every time I exit the game and restart all the levels are lost.  I have purchased gems and coins and the same thing happens when I exit the game and restart; all my purchases are gone.  Very disappointing.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works very well if all you want to do is look at your home (news) page. You probably won't be able to use it for any games. I love how it views the pictures posted on the news feed.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My 8 year old granddaughter sat through the entire movie without budging. She has autism and that's quite a feat for her to sit still through an entire movie.  It was worth the purchase.  She loved the movie.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I love being able to read my email on this app while on my kindle. So far, I've used it and it works very well. There is the capability to move your email to folders, but I had some trouble with that. I have so many folders that I kept dropping the mail into the wrong ones. So that is a part of the app that I don't use any more. Otherwise, emailing is easy, popping up a keyboard for your use to text back. But I wouldn't use it for any lengthy or complicated emails. You can delete email, move to folders, set up folders, and text back/reply. I haven't tried any other feature yet.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Can anyone ever not love this mans voice !!!!!!!!!!  My husband and i enjoy this music along with  Andre Rieu . Music you can understand  and relax by .
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app! I enjoy the sounds and music in the background, and all the selection that comes with this app. The only problem I have is that a couple of the pages are very small and there is no way to magnify it, that I have discovered yet. But all the other pages are just fine.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Her  wonderful voice and the fact that she is [was?] just an ordinary person is so inspiring! this is a lovely CD and i hope she makes many more
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was an absolute twisted rollercoaster ride! I've cried and I've laughed out loud. But I've never wanted something to work so badly for a dysfunctional couple. I loved it and cannot wait for part 3!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I've seen it three times now, and I just can't say enough great things about this movie. Definitely the best of the series, and one of my all time favorite movies. I'm not even that big into action movies, and I was still enthralled all three times.<br /><br />Awesome.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Theo Boone has always amazed me at how good he is at solving a case. He's a modern day Nancy drew. The only thing that deterred me was the price. TEN DOLLARS ?!?!?!?! A good book overall, but as always there are downsides to every good book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love hidden object games and played a variety to date from different developers. G5 has quite a few that I've played and the majority are great including this one. To each his own, since I don't always let reviews alone dictate my decision to purchase the full version. Since hidden object games can range from simply locating objects to those offering mini puzzles and dialogue combined. Thumbs up from me on this game :-)

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game for the whole family! Easy enough for the little ones by challenging for the adults.  Love the fact that it's free.  Only issue we had was the updating. We had to uninstall then reinstall

B004HO6I4M|5.0|Rio.......what can I say about Rio?  My grandson absolutely loves to watch this movie.  He dances along with the characters.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This thing is Video Crack!  I can't believe how much of my life I spent already trying to beat this game.  I had to quit bringing my Kindle to work as I was sneaking off to play it when I should have been working.  Last night I woke up dreaming about playing. . . .  Help!  I need Help!
B0057XMCLA|2.0|not enough of the original book.  the journey was great and is lost in this movie.  the book was MUCH better!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Got this for my daughter because she abslutely loves this movie. Getting the three pack was a great idea because we keep the regualar dvd over her grandmothers house, the Blu-ray at our homeand we als have it on the laptop so she always has it.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|A great movie to see in 3D. If you just bought a TV and glasses, this is a good choice to try them out.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|For such a descriptive author she put very little attention to detail at the end. The ending was unexpected and terrible. I feel she could have made a better effort...
