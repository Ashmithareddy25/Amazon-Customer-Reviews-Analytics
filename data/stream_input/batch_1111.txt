B001AII4RM|5.0|Beowulf is an epic computer animated film, with beautiful visuals, animation, characters and plenty of excitement. Please bring out this classic on Blu Ray 3D, considering the assets should already be in place as this film was released in theaters as a 3D presentation. Having seen the 3D version twice, I've been waiting a long time for someone to announce Beowulf is going to Blu Ray 3D.<br /><br />If you want to see Beowulf starring Ray Winstone, on Blu Ray 3D by 2012(also containing the 2D version)... Let them know.
030746363X|4.0|This book gives excellent information about diet and exercise. However, there are sexually explicit pictures of positions for intercourse so I would not put this book on my bookshelf for my teenage grandchildren to view. The rest of the book is excellent and I am reading parts of the book for a second time to review the information.
B002JI94J4|5.0|In the 1950's, British working class kids were looking around for something new and original.  Was it ever thus?  The Blue Collar classes had the Music Halls and Variety, and were satisfied with that.  Probably because they were happy to have survived WW2, and already had had enough excitement to last a lifetime.  The younger generation though, not having much if any recollection of the war wanted to find something fresh and novel to bring meaning to their boring, hum-drum lives.  All the best stuff seemed to be coming from across the Atlantic.  The movies, the Jazz, the Blues, and the Swing Orchestra's - and also this new stuff called Rock and Roll.  And what about that alarming young man who sings and moves in such a provocative manner called,ermmm - Elvis something or other?  All over Britain the kids enthused over this stuff.  They tried to copy and recreate these performers and their music, for a domestic audience because the demand was insatiable.  Unbelievably, there were no proper venues anywhere in Britain to entertain a mass audience like a rock concert for example.  Elvis never came to Britain to perform through his whole career for this reason - according to the Colonel...  There was also a great deal of prejudice from the older generation who just did not like this crazy music scene at all; and boys with long, untrimmed hair were an absolute disgrace!  Britain produced its own Rock & Roll stars like Lonnie Donegan, Billy Fury, Marty Wilde, Frankie Vaughn, Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard to name a few who were really nothing more than Brits trying to be American on stage.  However authentically American they tried to be, they just sounded sort of - British!  Few of these artists made any impression in America that I can remember.  When the Beatles burst onto the scene in that extraordinary year of 1963 they were a marvel.  I was only about 15 and got completely carried away with the whole Beatle-mania circus.  I ache with nostalgia for those heady times whenI look back now that I am well into my 60's and approaching retirement.    When the Beatles made their first tour of America in February 1964 the feeling here was they probably wouldn't catch on in an America still mourning the tragic loss of JFK just a few months earlier.  Would they really like and appreciate a bunch of `Limey' kids bringing their music back home to them?  I thought that Americans would probably ignore them at worse or tolerated their presence at best.  It is difficult to explain to younger people today how poor international communications were in those far off days.  News took a day or two to circulate as satellite telecoms were in their infancy and needed a special effort to set up.  It took me nearly a week to find out how the Beatles had gone down in New York.  I can remember listening to a broadcast from New York on short wave radio about the Beatles driving down Broadway in separate limousines.  If it hadn't been for a BBC radio show called \\"Saturday Club\\", hosted by the great Brian Matthew, I really don't thing I would have heard anything at all. We Beatles fans feared that they had completely bombed and had become a national embarrassment.  Gradually, the news hit that far from being a dismal failure - they had created a sensation!  I noticed that many, many people I met over here at the time were simply gobsmacked and open-mouthed with wonder about the Beatles' amazing reception.    This glorious film, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", gives a modern viewer a taste of British Beatle mania.  To me it is a treasure trove of nostalgia from a rather worn out and rather shabby England that was gradually coming out of its post-war gloom.  An England that was beginning to stir and to re-awaken, and we the younger generation had to prove to ourselves that we really did have something to offer the world.  An ancient, anachronistic country, weighed down by its long history.  Exhausted by war and its aftermath, deeply in debt; no longer a first-rate power.  Great Britain was finished - and the future was to be American!  What was to happen next has become - well, a sort of a legend.  \\"A Hard Day's Night \\"captures a brief moment of time that became a fulcrum in my own life's experience, when things were never to be quite the same again.  It is a documentary as much as it is a film.  But whatever - it is smashing entertainment; but 'tis a pity that such an important film has been given such a poor rendition for a presentation on Blu-ray. Hence the measly four stars. Surely it deserves better...
0316044695|2.0|\\"We are the best, we are the best. I am one of them. I am the best. I am a Patriot. I am very good in what I do. Most of the people can´t do what we or I do\\"    A very large part of the book is like this. Not worth reading.
B002RKRTGO|2.0|My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy.  If the character is reading something, you aren't.  Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away.  For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on.  I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks.  The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Sad that George Lucas is not finished screwing up his brilliant (first three) movies.   Please George can you give us the theatrical versions.  I don't want all the extra crud thats been added to it.  I just want a cleaned up version of what i watched when i was a kid.       I know the plan   you bring out the abortion version so that everyone buys it then once the sales flatten out you bring out the special super edition with extra crud when they sell flat then you bring out what people actually want.  Instant 3x sales.  Well sorry Im not buying :(
B000000OMB|5.0|THIS is a great rock album.  A little melodic, a little progressive, a little heavy, and a little commercial sounding (but not as much as the follow up 'Alpha').  Wetton's voice it so unique and soothing.  Great songs.  Great musicians.  You can't lose!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I really liked the concept of this movie. Its the first blu ray i have taken the time to see the bonus features. If you like weird, mess with your head type movies this is right there
B0000025YM|5.0|This album is sometimes overshadowed by the glorious 'Screaming For Vengeance'.  But honestly, I like 'Defenders Of The Faith' a little bit better.  In my opinion, 'Screaming' has two weak tracks (\\"Fever\\" and \\"Devil's Child\\"), whereas 'Defenders' doesn't have any weak tracks.  Both albums represent Judas Priest at their 80's peak.  As a point of reference, I have listed my top 5 Judas Priest albums in order:  1. Defenders Of The Faith  2. Screaming For Vengeance  3. Painkiller  4. Stained Class  5. British Steel
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I haeard Home in the car of my friend, and loved it. So I had to have the cd. I loved the cd. It was better then I hoped for.
B000089RV6|5.0|Not much more to say.  Every song cranks.  The songs seem to flow very smoothly from one to another, with no awkward shifts or breaks.  Great album to play when a party needs a little pep.  I guarantee this album will get the party going!  I've tried it on several occasions over the years.  A timeless classic!!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Thank God George Lucas doesn't control the rights to classics like Gone With the Wind, 2001 a space odyssey, Casablanca or Jaws. We'd never again get to see these masterworks the way audiences came to love them during their first runs in theatres. And as to the first 3 Star Wars movies (skip the others) I'm content to replay them in my memory. No Star Wars redoes for me Mr. Lucas... even if they are on Blu-ray.
B000002H6C|5.0|I love all four of Metallica's 80's albums, but after 20 years of listening to them, I noticed that this is the one I play more than the others.  I never seem to get burned out on it.  It could be the more \\"progressive\\" aspect of it that makes each song a little more involed and therefore more interesting.  'Ride' and 'Master' both shred, but 'Justice' kills!
0385493622|4.0|Singh superbly illustrates the art of mathematics.  Competently, he leads the reader through the beginnings of modern mathematics and the subsequent developments which paved the way for a modern solution to one of the most puzzled problems, Fermat's Last Theorem.  Fermat's Enigma provided a platform for me to glimpse the vast landscape of mathematics without being bogged down by technical minutiae which often masks the import of delicate logic and the beauty of mathematical constructions.  By presenting the narrative of Wiles' solution within the context of historical attempts as well as important advances within the general discourse, it gives the lay reader (as anyone reading it would be) a feel for the long history of mathematics that is woefully lacking in general maths education; each figure is interesting, diverse, and often tragic - but each, based on the delicate complexity of the human mind, have produced concepts which may (and probably will) out last our current world society - especially the conceits of \\"other\\" human cultural products.  ...not too many Pythagoreans around.
B002HMHRGE|4.0|According to the CD jacket liner notes by Jeff Tamarkin, &#34;Baron Von Tollbooth and the Chrome Nun&#34;--&#34;marked the end of an era&#34;.  Those same CD jacket liner notes explain that BVTATCN was not created with any theme in mind--but rather that it consists of various individual / group projects melded into a collaboration.  The entire effort seems more polished and consistent than its predecessor, &#34;Sunfighter&#34;, another Kantner-Slick-Extended Family Effort.  And indeed, BVTATCN goes down very smooth.  The Jefferson Starship sound in its best years (1974-1976) is evolving on this album.  This record takes me in right from the beginning; there's a momentum provided by the consistent quality of the cuts; it is a very good &#34;album&#34; and not just a &#34;record with a few good songs&#34; (the latter being the case with &#34;Sunfighter&#34;).  My only major criticism is that Grace's voice, although powerful as always, sounds strained and hoarse on this album.  Highlights of BVTATCN include &#34;Harp Tree Lament&#34;, a kind of groovy-feel-good-hippie-Big-Sur-acid-trip ballad; in a similar / parallel vein, the New Age-Higher consciousness-influenced &#34;Your Mind Has Left Your Body&#34;; and finally &#34;Sketches of China&#34;, a Kantneresque rock anthem / ballad that opens with a resonating gong and features some nice backup organ as well.  The tone of &#34;Baron Von Tollbooth and the Chrome Nun&#34; is ultimately both ethereal and driven--the particular sound on this record also having been derived from secondary participation by Jerry Garcia.<br /><br />Stephen C. Bird, Author of &#34;Any Resemblance To A Coincidence Is Accidental&#34;
B003UESJFG|4.0|Just a quick review. As a movie it is great in the beginning, mediocre midway (kinda slow) and good again for the last third. Still a pretty good movie. What sets this apart for the home experience for me is the audio in 7.1 Dolby Tru-Hd.If you have a good quality surround sound system or maybe you just purchased one you'll want to buy this (2D)Blu-Ray. This is one of the best \\"home theater sound experiences\\"
B0030I5S8I|5.0|The second you open \\"American on Purpose\\" ,Craig Ferguson grabs you by the arm and pulls you into his life. Your not a reader, your not a voyuer ;your there with him and it's not an easy walk, run or ride.     Born in Glasgow,Scottland, dreaming of America, stummbling wildly close to self-detruction but incredibly talented He chooses to continue to pursue the adventures life has waiting for him rather thanself destruction.    Craig's unique ability to communicate and engage people in eye to eye heart to heart situations is striking.  And as he states very early on in the book, \\" He spares himself no blushes\\"    Adapting Craig's show sign-off to the book: \\"What did we learn from your book tonite Craig?.......    As Craig puts it....failure is not disgrace. It' just a pitch that u missed, and you'd better get ready for the nextone. The next one might be the the shot heard round the world.\\"

B0034G4OUO|3.0|A ex-con (Johnson) is out to avenge the death of his brother.  After being released from a 10 year prison sentence Driver begins hunting down and killing those responsible for killing his brother.  To complicate things a cop (Thornton) and a hired hitman are chasing him down and trying to stop him.  Finally....The Rock has come back to R rated movies.  Seven minutes into the movie Driver is released from prison, runs to his car and kills the first person on the list.  The action doesn't stop...until halfway through the movie.  This is almost like two different movies in a way, filled with action in the beginning, then a drama about forgiveness.  This movie was better then I expected and is a pretty good time.  The one complaint I have is that noone really seemed like they wanted to be in it.  The acting for the entire movie seemed phoned in.  Johnson and Thornton both seemed bored and gave thier worst performances I've seen from them, but it is an action movie and acting really doesn't matter a whole lot.  I give it a B-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think so
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This was a great movie. Many of my friends hace come over to watch it and all have loved it. It's a truly great story of a truly great horse
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna did not experience a sophomore slump with this album - in fact this is the one that launched her into pop superstardom!<br /><br />Her risque performance of the title track on the MTV awards show heightened anticipation for the album and the clever video for MATERIAL GIRL (a song with a strong opening drum beat & bass backing) helped cement her place as an icon.<br /><br />I've found though that my favorite tracks are the ones that Madonna co-wrote or wrote by herself:<br /><br />SHOO BEE-DOO - ballad that begins with a sweet acoustic vocal from Madonna and kicks into a doo-wopish sound; I can't hear this track enough even to this day;<br /><br />OVER & OVER - love the lyrics of this song \\"and if at first you don't succeed, here's some advice that you should heed - you get up again, over & over...\\"<br /><br />ANGEL - whispery vocals on this mid-tempo track<br /><br />I also give Madonna props for taking on a classic r&b track, LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE - she really sings her heart out and although not as good as the original, she surely made it her own<br /><br />The only song that I really don't like is PRETENDER and while STAY is ok, I just don't like it as much as I love tracks 1 - 7.  Just as with her debut, listening to this album transports me back to a happier time in my life and I can't help but smile as I reminisce while listening to the music.
0811870413|5.0|I have quite a few baking books and I have to say that this one is the easiest to follow wile getting awesome results. No talk about any special flour for baguettes to get the airy crumb with thin crackly crust. The passion and level of mastery of baking bread comes across in the stories and formulas. Follow the easy to understand record and you will easily make bread just like in the pics. Have fun and enjoy delicious bread ;)
B00005J6T1|5.0|I used to be a huge Madonna fan back in the day! She burst onto the music scene with such a strong sense of style and had ATTITUDE for days and I loved her to bits! This debut still has a special place in my heart for its fun danceable tracks and Madonna's ability to totally own her singing style.<br /><br />At the time that the first track HOLIDAY debuted, a lot of people assumed that Madonna was a Black woman because back then there was no internet nor were we flooded with gossip mags so all you had to go on was the music. When I bought the vinyl album there was no picture of Madonna on the cover but by the time people found out that she was White it didn't matter because that track was such a hit. If memory serves me right it came out in the summer so all you heard as you drove around neighborhoods on Memorial Day, 4th of July & Labor Day weekends was this song - it was inescapable.<br /><br />The dawn of MTV was also very fortuitous for Madonna because as soon as viewers got a look at her LUCKY STAR & BORDERLINE videos, she was well on her way to becoming a huge star - she was beautiful, energetic, charismatic and could dance. Her early videos were low-budget but eye-catching & both of these songs are insanely catchy and to this day I never tire of hearing them.<br /><br />My other favorite tracks are:<br /><br />BURNING UP - with that kick a@# guitar solo and I do recall her having a video for the track but this song didn't really take off like the others<br /><br />EVERYBODY - with its hypnotic beat, this track could probably draw crowds to the dance floor of any club today<br /><br />THINK OF ME - kind of midtempo doo-wopish track<br /><br />PHYSICAL ATTRACTION - another strong dance track<br /><br />Whenever I want to be transported back to a happier space in time (at least in my life) I pull out this disc - it's a great debut that stands the test of time.
B004FEFZU2|4.0|SAW ends well - plenty gory enough for any SAW fan - the one thing that disappointed me the most is that what the product does NOT tell you is that the 3D is designed for the newer 3D tvs & you need the active shutter glasses -- it was advertised in a way I thought it was like the My Bloody Valentine that came out 2 years ago, it came with the old type 3D glasses that gave you great 3D eperience -- the Blu Ray will still work great with ANY Blu Ray player but, will default to 2D unless you have player capable of 3D - you will still get a gorgeous picture  BUT, unless you are set up with  new 3D system don't expect to see any of that.

0061876755|5.0|\\"Ordinary Thunderstorms\\" is a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  When Adam Kindred tries to return some papers to a man he chanced to meet at a London restaurant he is thrust into the middle of a murder investigation.  Adam's life is changed in an instant by this accidental encounter.    This is not a perfect book.  There are a few things that stretch credulity, but I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the idea of what really comprises a person's identity.  Somehow the simple driving plot reminded me of an early John Grisham book, only with an expanded vocabulary.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|I really enjoyed 'The Town', It'd been directed very well, maybe my judgment is affected from the fact that I live in Boston, but the movie is plenty of action, its not easy to make a movie about robbing bank that is not annoying, buy it. ! : )    P.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I like the product, it arrived on time as in the condition described. Very pleased with the service.  Thank you.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Great book. I bought it and read it in one afternoon. This book is like Mystic River, The Town and The Departed all rolled into one. In fact, there are some scenes in it that seem lifted directly from Mystic River (the child kept hidden by a pedophile in an underground bunker, found by hunters after a long period of time) and that also seem to have lent themselves, in turn, to The Departed (the female shrink and the cop who won't drink) and The Town ('you're mother's gone and she's not coming back'). I had to wonder, is Boston really such a small town that all cop stories situated in its borders seem to be the same?
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Good acting. People none of us would friend in reality, the real world. They got rich off a desire to socialize. To hell with real friendship. Lie, cheat and party. Genius, but at what price. Leaves you thinking= great movie. Not very nice people.
B001KMB6VE|4.0|Yeah, they could have made this movie longer and delved more into Aurora's back story and edited in some more info. But I've seen this movie on more than one occasion and it always holds my interest and if it would have been fleshed out a bit more it could have been amazing.<br /><br />Instead what we get is a solid sci-fi flick starring Vin Diesel as a funny yet apathetic merc who has to transport a young woman across countries. The story unfolds little by little through out and by the end of the film you understand why she was being brought over and who wanted her there etc etc.<br /><br />The action and special effects are done well, the storyline is good but again could have been more in depth and not so thrown in editing wise, the video and audio quality is very nice on the Blu-Ray, and the acting is good as well. Is this going to be a classic like let's say Blade Runner? Most likely not, however it's not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Does it have it's stutters and lapses,yes. But if you go into this with an open mind and really think about the storyline past the film's ending, you should get at least a little satisfaction from the film/story.<br /><br />Anytime I watch this the movie always holds my attention, and Vin Diesel's character is a pretty cool role, and I also love the scenery during most of the movie.<br /><br />I give this movie a B grade wise. Not the best, but definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen either, give it a rental and see for yourself ;)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This small sharpener totally surprised me.  I used it on the dullest paring knife I had in my kitchen.  3 quicks runs through the carbide sharpener followed by 3 or 4 passes through the ceramic sharpener and it was a sharp as it was when it was new.  Great results for a such an inexpensive device.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I bought this headphone amp to use with a laptop and a desktop that would not drive my Sennheiser HD 570s to an adequate volume. It does increase volume, but don't expect it to make the sound quality better. If you're looking for better sound quality than what motherboard sound chips can provide buy the NuForce uDAC-2. I cannot recommend it enough.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I agree with those who think the \\"Critic's\\" review are ALL WRONG.  This is a movie I would buy the DVD for and I think that says it all.  I LOVED it.

030726999X|3.0|For me, it was boring until about the middle of the book-when Lisbeth was able to use her computer. That's when things really picked up. Although her relationship with Blomkvist was strained, she had to trust him. At first she resisted, but then the old team was back-although they worked apart because of this trial.<br />I found the talk of politics boring. That's just me. And since the politics were about a country on the other side of the world, I had trouble relating. The author seemed to stuff political events down my throat. I didn't feel that was quite fair, since this was the last book in the trilogy and I had to find out how it came out. It was like a forced history lesson.<br />I loved when the author got past pontificating and got to the story in the middle of the book. It was so exciting when Lisbeth got back into the picture.<br />So, I felt that the first half of the book was boring and that the second half was the best!
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|Of course, this is a spectacular film, well written, well acted, extremely well crafted.  My only complaint about this Blu-ray is that there was no surround sound effect on it.   The opening of the disc indicates surround sound when the studio logo is shown, but the film itself has none.  Is it possible I have a defective disc.
0938045695|4.0|This book is *the* standard for learning the mechanics of the kettlebell, and it provides a number of well-planned routines ranging from beginner to expert.  This book does an exceptional job at the task for which it was intended.  However, if I knew nothing about kettlebells already, I don't think I would have finished this book, because Pavel bears many of the earmarks of a fly-by-night pitchman.  He makes over-the-top claims that the kettlebell is the One True Path to fitness, and that American athletes have been doing it wrong all this time.  His previous workout book & DVD, [[ASIN:0938045326 The Russian Kettlebell Challenge]], bears the dubious credential of \\"Pavel Tsatsouline, Master of Sports\\".  He challenges the reader's masculinity with phrases like \\"the dishonor of aerobics\\" and \\"earn the right to call yourself a man\\".  Like other fitness authors, he also includes plenty of pitches for his own brand of kettlebell products and certifications; the last fourteen pages of my book are nothing but full-page ads.    Fortunately, however, Pavel is more than just a pitchman; he knows his subject as well as anybody in the kettlebell business.  If you can get past the salesmanship and the immature writing style, and pay attention to the notes about form and mechanics, this is an excellent introduction to the kettlebell.  This book and the companion DVD will get you started on a fast, safe, balanced, and effective full-body fitness routine.
B0040QYROA|5.0|The 1927 silent film classic by Fritz Lang has been brought back to life.  Even in its previous truncated and confused condition, Metropolis was rightly considered one of the greatest films of all time.  Now, in this beatifully restored and virtually complete edition, its brilliance is even more in evidence.<br />With the 2008 discovery in Argentina of a 16mm print containing almost 30 minutes of additional footage, the film is closer to Lang's original vision than it's been since its Berlin premiere.<br />While it's true the restored footage still has its flaws, the restorers have done an excellent job considering what they had to work with.  A few of the transitions between the 'lost' and existing footage are jarring on first viewing, but that is a minor complaint.  Overall, this is a film of stunning visuals paired with great emotional depth.  A masterpiece.

0307278409|3.0|I am not sure what to think about this book.<br /><br />1. The whole thing can be read in 4-4.5 hours (the pages just fly by).<br />2. Men who are in relationships don't use nearly as many words to describe them as this woman does. Was the point of this book to get an idea of the things that go on in womens' heads during relationships? The book is a good way to kill an afternoon (or two), but a lot of guys studiously avoid asking a woman to talk too much. One benefit of this book is being able to open that discussion, but then close it again by just putting down the book.<br />3. I'm not sure at whom this book was aimed. The writer used a lot of Chinese usages of English. In the one case, if she expects most readers to understand the usages of Chinese proverbs translated into English (Zç\\"`&Ograve;(tm)\-- \\"watching a tree to catch a rabbit\\"), then she is sorely mistaken. If she is expecting us to understand Chinese English (I understand this very well after living here for about 7 years), then she is mistaken again. Is she trying to give us a course in Chinese English 101?<br />4. Again, as a man reading this book, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be getting out of it. Some woman who is smitten with a man who is flawed in some way (and passes up how many other men to be with that guy). Oh, yeah (*smirk), that's the first time I've ever seen *that* happen. So after seeing this foolishness in real life about a dozen times, I should open up a fiction book and find 300 pages of the same thing staring me in the face again? Um, OK.<br />5. Not sure how consistent/ realistic this book is. Can we really be expected to believe any of the following:<br />a. There is a woman who has never had sex in China, but comes to England and hops into bed with a man who is sexually confused (yet is in his 40s after having relationships with men for 20 years)?<br />b. And this woman discovers masturbation for the first time in a public space(yet has no idea what a vibrator can be used for)?<br />c. And then she goes to Europe and has sex with some random stranger with 4 teeth?<br />d. Were there no other young English men that would pick up on a Hot Asian girl (highly desired in all Western dating markets, because they are almost ALL hot) and make her think twice about being with a middle aged sexually confused man?<br />e. And that there is a Chinese person whose primary interest is something other than money? (Can you imagine any Chinese person who would give up being a factory owner/ job at a government office to stay with an old queen in England)?<br /><br />The book is definitely not worth the new purchase price (I didn't buy it new anyway). I won't be coming back to this for successive reads of this text. $1 plus shipping is what I spent, and that's about what it is worth.pe and has sex with some random stranger with 4 teeth?   d. Were there no other young English men that would pick up on a Hot Asian girl (highly desired in all Western dating markets, because they are almost ALL hot) and make her think twice about being with a middle aged sexually confused man?  e. And that there is a Chinese person whose primary interest is something other than money? (Can you imagine any Chinese person who would give up being a factory owner/ job at a government office to stay with an old queen in England)?    The book is definitely not worth the new purchase price (I didn't buy it new anyway). I won't be coming back to this for successive reads of this text. $1 plus shipping is what I spent, and that's about what it is worth.
B00003CXA2|1.0|This movie was just more of the classic racist theme of  'a white man saves the day' and in this case a retarded one. As usual, in keeping with the white savior theme, a white man rescues a black man and helps the black man start a business.  This movie is just more of the prevailing racist propaganda perpetuated by Hollywood that portrays a retarded white male as more intelligent than a black man.  And we wonder why racist stereotypes persist.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|If you like top notch rock'n'roll it doesn't get better than this. Do you self a favour and grab a copy. It rocks and it rolls and it hits all the right places, even the soft ones - \\"Stranger In My Life\\". They rock and they roll! And they rule too!
030746363X|5.0|I am a 41 year-old woman who has a medium frame and, for the most part, a thin build but a propensity toward weight gain due more to emotional eating than bad day-to-day eating habits. So, whenever I tip the scales up 10-20 (to 155-175) on my 5' 8\\" body, I'm looking for the \\"magic\\" diet. But really should be looking for a healthy do-able way to eat so I don't continue yo-yo-ing through life.  I believe I have FOUND IT!  I LOVE Tim's 4-hour-body book and slow-carb diet!!!!!! This is probably the best \\"diet\\" I've ever been on -- and I've pretty much tried them all!  It not only makes sense to me, but it doesn't leave you hungry or feeling deprived, and everything on it is easily and readily available to anyone, so it's realistic and practical.  I'm 145 lbs on good days. Today I am 163 -- started the diet a week ago at 171. Not only do I feel Tim's diet will bring me to 145, I actually feel motivated and hopeful for the first time that I can go below that without getting into restrictive behavior, which is dangerous territory for me.  My husband (6' 1\\", 214 last week) is down 10 lbs!!!!  We are doing this diet together. Changing the way we eat. AND the best part is we can keep our 2 glasses of red wine a day! (I used to drink white wine, and he used to drink beer, but we are happy to be on a diet that actually permits some alcohol, guilt free!).  I'm onto the other chapters beyond the weight loss, and just ordered a kettlebell -- I can't wait to start doing that exercise, and see where it brings me... Thanks Tim!!!!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is another one of Denzel Washington fantastic movies.  I would highly recommend this for friday night movie in.
0316098337|3.0|This book has a very interesting premise, especially with recent cases like Jaycee Dugard in the news. The book is a tad difficult to get get into, because it involves many pages of Jack telling us what he and Ma do day-in and day-out. It definitely sets the tone for the book and gives the reader an idea of how narrow their world is, and it's naturally repetitive. I don't agree with some previous reviews that Jack's dialogue isn't believable for his age, I found it to be appropriate and well-written. It's frustrating that the reader doesn't get more insight in certain areas due to the narrator being so young, but in some ways this is the point of the book. You aren't meant to see the world through Ma's eyes, but through the eyes of an extremely sheltered young boy.    I will agree that the second half of the book loses steam and doesn't seem to fit with the beginning of the book. Although it still held my interest, I was somewhat disappointed with the story that came after reading the tense scene that splits the two sections of the book. I did find this scene far-fetched, but it kept my attention and I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened. Ma's character does seem to fall apart in the second half, but this is almost expected given the circumstances. For the first time in many years she is able to think more of herself and not solely focus on Jack and his survival and safety.    I think that Room would be a great concept for a movie, with a few tweaks here and there. All in all it's worth a read, despite the fact that it wasn't one of my favorite books ever.
B002ECEHZQ|5.0|This book changed our lives.<br /><br />I have a daughter with Reactive Attachment Disorder.  If you are considering Holding Time, I assume you are familiar with RAD.  This technique is NOT for children who are merely misbehaving.  It is for children who are in serious distress because, for whatever reason, their needs were not met as infants.  In our case, my daughter was in an orphanage in China for her first ten months.<br /><br />Our therapist recommended this book to me.  I was hesitant at first, but out of desperation I gave it a try.  It worked like magic the VERY FIRST TIME I tried the technique.  My then-5-year-old daughter resisted until she started weeping.  Afterwards, she said she felt better, but she didn't know why.  Her state of mind went from angry and frustrated to completely peaceful.  It sounds too good to be true, but that is exactly how it went.<br /><br />The technique I learned from Holding Time puts me literally right there for her physically and emotionally.  I just keep repeating \\"Mommy loves you.  No matter what, Mommy loves you.\\"  I ask her questions to try and get to the bottom of her behavior (\\"Did something happen at school? \\"Are you nervous about performing in the play?\\"  \\"Are you sad that grandma is leaving soon?\\")  Don't be alarmed if at first it is quite unpleasant.  These children have so much anger and fear, and they will take it out on you.  It will get better, and the relationship and trust you build will be life changing.<br /><br />At first, my daughter needed holding several times a day, now we rarely need it (she is 8).  She is happy, loving and able to express her feelings without acting out.  We went from needing weekly double-sessions of therapy to \\"as needed.\\"  We have had one session in 7 months.<br /><br />If your child's unhappiness and anger is ruining your family life, give Holding Time a chance.  Our lives have completely turned around.  We have a well adjusted, sweet, happy little girl - no more tantrums.  Life is so good!is so good!
B004BLJQOK|3.0|Honestly,, I liked the original better. The remake isn't any better than the original. It's acutally a duplicate copy much like Psycho remake. If u don't like subtitles than stick to the remake. the remake is kinda filmed dark meaning u couldn't hardly see the gore nor the background. The original was filmed bright and it captured the gore. The remake was actually a little less gorier than the original.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|This movie deserves more than a 4-star, not just because of the many comical sex scenes during the movie and the true love which unfolds between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway at the end, but also for its brilliant satire about how business is conducted in the pharmaceutical industry and the screwed up health-care system in particularly American society.    Seriously though, all the bs aside, Anne Hathaway is one of my favorite actresses (whom I never thought would choose to have so much nudity in the film). You're wrong if you think this just some sex romantic comedy, you're wrong. Keep watching it to the end!
B004MMEIK0|2.0|This book wasn't good or bad, it was just blah, though some things irritated me. I don't get the high ratings, people must have really low expectations. The author tries too hard to be funny and as a result....is not. All the jokes fall flat and are generally pretty pedestrian, the attempts at witticism...um, no. I was offended by the characterisation of the accents of the different cultures of the various vampires and others in the book, it was pretty inconsistent, I mean if you're going to put a \\"Z\\" at the end of every word that ends in \\"th\\" for the female French vampire Simone, then you should probably drop the \\"H\\" at the beginning of \\"him\\" as well as there is no \\"H\\" sound at the start of a word in French and native speakers have a pretty hard time remembering to pronounce it in English and usually pronounce it with some degree of difficulty and extra work on their part. No self respecting Scotsman who says \\"dinna\\" is going to follow it up \\"my\\", he'll say \\"me\\", I know cause I spent 7 years of my bloody life in Edinburgh hearing that crap. Then the accent of the cab driver was either \\"African or Caribbean\\", hmmmm problematic on a couple fronts. First the different islands of the Caribbean all have different accents because the roots of all the creoles they speak originate in many different languages, we can all understand each others English, but we all sound completely different, and we don't sound at all like Africans, not even close, hell not even all Africans sound alike, it's a continent, not a country, ya know? Even though Africans and West Indians (what people from the Caribbean prefer to be called, not Caribbeans) share a lot of the same cultures, food and even loan words within our respective creole languages, We. Sound. Nothing. Alike. Which someone with half a working brain can attest to. Basically the authors take on accents is some middle American take on what they THINK these accents sound like. If you're gonna write about other people and their cultures, do some bloody research man. But then again, maybe I'm expecting too much from a romance writer? Yeah probably. She could take lessons from Richelle Mead or Rachel Caine. This was a free book and I didn't even finish it. Blah.ures, do some bloody research man. But then again, maybe I'm expecting too much from a romance writer? Yeah probably. She could take lessons from Richelle Mead or Rachel Caine. This was a free book and I didn't even finish it. Blah.

0307408833|3.0|If you have Celiac don't buy this unless you are a vegan and excellent baker who can alter recipes. The author recommends not altering the recipes, as they were formulated with those ingredients. So why buy this?    It seems like this cookbook would appeal mostly to the trendy gluten free consumer who wants healthy food, but doesn't need a gluten free diet.    Mine was a very thoughtful, well-meant gift, yet I would have to buy agave nectar and coconut oil and other things I don't have and don't care to have. I'm fine with an occasional higher fat and sugary treat! I don't eat cupcakes for nutrition. Only a treat.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|I can't possibly add anything new to the reviews of the movie itself (besides mentioning that it is the single funniest movie ever written by any creature in the known universe since the beginning of time - except for some other movies) but I will say this. If you are ever in Scotland, or if you are a truly loyal Python fan who will spend millions of dollars to vacation in Britain for a week or two, go to the village of Doune in Stirlingshire where you will discover Doune Castle in which many scenes from the Holy Grail were filmed. My wife and I discovered it quite by accident ten years ago, literally stumbling into the castle gift shop where we were informed of the castle's dubious history of Pythonian interest. The opening scene castle, the French castle, Castle Anthrax, Swamp Castle, the Camelot dancing scene... I could go on but that's it so I would then be lying. Upon paying for entrance to the castle grounds, you are given an MP3 player which will guide you through numerous areas used during filming - and narrated by none other than - Terry Jones! I'm not making this up unless the doctors are not telling me everything. Watch \\"The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations\\" featurette for a far less expensive tour of the castle than actually going there, but then you won't get to sample the local Haggis.
0307272702|5.0|Author Gary Taubes is one of a few voices crying in the wilderness.  Fortunately, he isn't willing to shut up, and we're beginning to get his message.<br /><br />Permit me to preface my comments on WWGF with a word about my recent quest for such widsom.  I haven't read Gary Taubes previous best seller Good Calories, Bad Calories.  Why We Get Fat is the fourth book that I've read since July 17, 2010 when I started searching in earnest to gain an understanding of why my waistline had been increasing at a slow, steady rate and what to do about it.  At my wife's prompting, we both read a borrowed copy of The South Beach Diet.  While that diet worked (I lost 15 years of accumulated weight in about a month), I recognized a mixed message in the author's philosophy (which Taubes addresses in WWGF's Book I / Biology, Not Physics).  On The South Beach Diet, I was hungry most all of the time.  That's not how I want to live the rest of my life. This motivated me to pick up and read Cereal Killer (2008 by Al Watson) which I had purchased from my nutritional supplement vendor about a year prior.  CK proved to be the key that unlocked the door to the pathway to dietary sanity as outlined in Why We Get Fat.<br /><br />Next, I purchased one of the books referenced in CK titled Life Without Bread, originally published in the German language by the late Dr. Wolgang Lutz, M.D. (Liebe Ohn Brot, 1967) and available since 2000 in English with co-author Christian B. Allen, Ph.D.  I mention LWB because of the revelatory nature of the message from a metabolic and physiological standpoint.  Dr. Lutz' message was unheard of!  Well thanks to Gary Taubes WWGF, as the late Paul Harvey would say, now I know \\"the rest of the story\\".<br /><br />Let me also say that in the month or so since I finished reading WWGF, I've been fascinated to read a number of the reviews on this Amazon site.  In particular, I've looked at the three star as well as the few one star reviews.  Suffice to say, to assimilatethe facts as outlined in WWGF will \\"pose a challenge to our beliefs - our paradigm\\" (pg. 31).  Quoting Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, Taube includes \\"I believe that you can reach the point, where there is no longer any difference between developing the habit of pretending to believe and developing the habit of believing\\".  In other words, during the years since World War II the western medical community and western society in general has progressively been sold a flat earth nutritional bill of goods, and it has become the conventional wisdom.  Even those physicians who are enlightened to the truths contained in WWGF are loath to prescribe same to their obese patients for fear of malpractice litigation.  \\"Any disaster that may overtake him [the patient], even to the extent of gound moles getting in his lawn, will be blamed on the diet\\" (pg. 216).  Any jury of his or her clinician peers is sure to find culpability in having strayed from the path of convention.<br /><br />The central messages of WWGF surround two different themes.  First is the biology of what causes obesity as apposed to the physics of the calories in/calories out convention.  Taubes does a first rate job of dispelling the mistaken notion of calories in/calories out as the end all and be all to causing and controlling obesity.  Of particular interest is the history of this idea, which has taken root following WWII where factors like societal prejudice against our vanquished European enemy prevented consideration of the accumulated wisdom of two centuries.  Thankfully, the author of Life Without Bread, Dr. Wolfgang Lutz, M.D. being Austrian was not so hindered.<br /><br />Having slayed the misconception of physics rather than biology as being the cause of obesity, Taubes second central message focuses on the science of the regulation of fat tissue, or what he calls Book II / Adiposity 101.  Just as in Book I, the author sites numerous epidemiological studies as evidence to substantiate his explanation of exactly how we metabloize fat.  The science is certainly not too difficult for the average reader to grasp.  An example of the clarity with which Taubes writes is where he states \\"So the correct way to think about fat tissue is that it's more like a wallet than a savings or retirement account\\" (pg. 115).  I've chosen this quote because it illustrates the practical nature of his message.<br /><br />Gary Taubes is reaching his audience with practical information that can and will, in my opinion, slay the two headed monster of diabesity.  This is an important book, and an even more important message.  Fully one in four adult Americans suffer from \\"metabolic syndrome\\".  This includes obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and \\"lipid\\" abnormalities like low HDL, high triglicerides, and small, dense LDL.  The number of victims continues to climb at an alarming rate.<br /><br />Kudos to Gary Taubes for writing Why We Get Fat And What To Do About IT.  I would like to personally thank him along with the authors of the other fine books that I've mentioned.  Some days I'm so thrilled at my 1980's weight profile that I put on my best suit for a few minutes just for the fun of it!  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
0439023491|5.0|Warning:  There could quite well be some spoilers in this review.<br /><br />This of course is the second book in what now has become a pretty well known trilogy.  The book pretty much begins where the first book, [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] stopped.  It would be difficult to consider this work a stand alone read and I certainly would not recommend starting the series here, but rather with the first book.<br /><br />This particular story (And I am referring to all three books) is one that most certainly can be classified as a \\"crossover\\" read.  It was obviously meant for the YA group but it seems to have captivated adult readers as much as it has the younger set.  I must include myself in this category as I found these books to be absolutely fascinating, haunting and I will tell you, almost impossible to put down once I started reading them.  There are reasons for this, but more about that later.<br /><br />With over 800 reviews on this work so far it would be difficult to add any truly original thought; I can only add my opinion and attempt to pass on my pleasure in reading these things.<br /><br />Since the plot has been beat to death here I will not go into any depth at all in this review.  Do be aware that the world of Katniss and Petta and the rest of the characters is pretty much the same here as in the first book but as the reader will soon discover, there is change in the breeze; their world is changing and it is obvious that these changes will be quite profound.  The author does take us through another secession of The Hunger Games as played out in the first book, and it is even more twisted and evil than the first...so very much more cruel.  There are a number of new characters introduced in this work and we get to learn much more about some of the originals as we read.  Characters become more fleshed out and much more complex.  Relationships take strange turns and not ever thing is as it seems.<br /><br />As has been pointed out in a number of very fine reviews here, this is the second novel in a trilogy.  If you are a novel, that is a horrid place to be.  Like all such works, this is a sort of transition book; one that takes us from the beginning and sets us up for the grand ending.  Not an easy task for any writer (Even Tolkien had a few problems with \\"The Two Towers,\\" in this aspect).  This author pulls it off better than most though and I must say that while I may not have enjoyed this second offering quite as much as the first, I never the less loved it and it was absolutely necessary to read in order to get to the conclusion of the story.<br /><br />Now these books are popular...there are a lot of people who have read them and a lot of people who are still reading them.  To begin with, this author is a very natural story teller and a very good writer when you consider the genre she is working with.  Her story is believable and in a strange sort of way, logical.  You can fully sympathize with all the \\"good guys\\" and really dislike the bad ones.  The book is extremely entertaining (at least I thought so) and at the same time gives you some good food for thought on several levels.  It is an easy read in a technical sense, yet the subject matter can (as it should and as the author meant it to be) quite emotional and troubling.<br /><br />I started this book immediately after I finished the first and when I finished this one I immediately read the last.  I must say I enjoyed the entire trip and this will be a series of books that I will give a reread in the very near future.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksry fine reviews here, this is the second novel in a trilogy.

It has early good reviews.
0956251579|5.0|Out of the last three books I have bought through amazon, this is the only one I finished. The other two I bought based on excellent reviews, and put them down half way through because I was so bored. That being said, I started reading this book with no expectations, and it has ended up being one of the best books I've read in quite a while. I'm sorry now that it is over.<br />\\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" tells the parallel story of Catherine or Cathy, set in two different times: before and during domestic abuse and after (HINT: pay attention to the dates at the beginning of the chapters!). It reminded me a bit of the movie \\"Sliding Doors\\" (great flick, by the way!). It is as much a psychological thriller as a suspense novel. What I found so smart about this novel was the similarities between the two time periods: the beginning of a relationship, the rise in suspense, etc. It was like being on two roller coasters at the same time. It was just graphic enough without going over the top: it was not written to shock the reader but to portray what the charactors where going through very well. It was easy to get engaged with all the characters, and the chemistry between the charactors was realistic and didn't feel forced. Not even a quarter of the way into the way into the book, I couldn't put it down.<br />The only thing I need to warn about is that being an American, I was unfamiliar with some of the dialect. This book was written in England, and although a lot of it I already had an understanding of, there were a few words here and there that I hadn't heard used in that manor before. There wasn't enough of it to detract from the book now, and in fact I think I learned some from it :-).
0517548232|5.0|I have to laugh at the negative reviews of this book.  They are probably written by socialists who don't understand economics, otherwise they wouldn't be socialists. Hazlitt's arguments are based on (1) a real understanding of economics and (2) facts, including that socialism has been an abject failure where ever it has been tried.  In contrast, the arguments of modern liberals are based on emotions and are devoid of facts and of thinking about the world as it is.      I can tell you that this is one of the very best books that has ever been written on economics.

0061726826|3.0|This would have easily become a classic if Oliver didnt get carried her way with her over description. Oliver just kills it with all her similes and over description. Everything is described too much, too much inner monologue, too much whining and the list goes on.  Its sad because Lena is an awesome protag, but all the whining and usage of \\"like\\" is giving me headache. No joke Oliver uses like 732 times! Very uncalled for!  Still, one of the best of 2011 and I love Lena. It should be noted Oliver is probably one of the best young adult writers out there today. A must read despite the minor irritations and faulty world building.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|First, \\"Let The Right One In\\" was clearly superior to \\"Let Me In\\" even though the screenplays are virtually identical.  If you want to see one of the greatest Dark Urban Fantasy/Horror films ever made, rent the original and watch it with subtitles -- outstanding film.  \\"Let Me In\\" was a very good attempt at a remake, but the wooden acting of two unlikeable characters -- the \\"father\\" and the \\"detective\\" -- detracted from the film quite a bit.  Also gotta mention a glaring technical error regarding the detective character: after he kicks in an apartment door without a warrant he proceeds to clear the rooms with his pistol, a Colt 1911A1.  The 1911 is one of the most popular pistol platforms in the United States, and it is a single action automatic which requires the external hammer to be cocked before it will be capable of firing, and they are typically carried \\"cocked and locked\\" as they have both a thumb safety and a grip safety, allowing it to be carried safely let enabling it to be drawn and fired very quickly and accurately.  This is practically common knowledge amongst anyone with a basic level of experience with firearms.  You would think that at least one technical advisor would've noted the fact that the detective's 1911 was not cocked and thereby incapable of being fired as he cleared the apartment.  Not deducting a point for that, even though it irritated me.<br /><br />This remake was surprisingly good considering all the negative reviews.  Sure, not as great as the original, but face reality folks -- the average American doesn't like foreign films and especially doesn't like reading subtitles, so if it wasn't for this retelling many folks would miss out on this great movie and it might fade to obscurity.  Those who like it might be compelled to seek out the original, and I encourage them to do so.  Like I said before, screenplays are virtually identical and the differences are few.  Acting was not as bad as some reviewers would have you believe.  I thought it was worthwhile.  4 Stars.worthwhile.  4 Stars.
0743455967|5.0|I have to say, I didn't know what to expect when I began reading Stephen King's On Writing.  I've never read any of his books, despite the fact that we share the same last name (we're not related... that'd be kind of awesome, though).  I really don't like anything of the horror genre.  If I read any of his books, I'd probably be up for weeks with nightmares.  So I was quite happy to find that this memoir wasn't frightening at all.<br /><br />To say the least, it was interesting to learn about King's life growing up, especially with a backdrop familiar to me.  The fact that he lives in Maine only makes his story that much more relatable.  I liked seeing his struggles publishing as a teenager and how he finally became successful.  I also had no idea he'd been a drug addict or an alcoholic - it was surprising to see how much his life affected his work during that time.<br /><br />The \\"Toolbox\\" and \\"On Writing\\" sections were more exciting than I expected.  I found myself learning while being entertained.  King used excellent examples for all of the grammar bits, some of which had me laughing out loud - surprising since though I'm quite the stickler for grammar, it's notoriously boring.  The lessons on adverbs and dialogue were especially helpful.  I liked having an inside look at the way he works, especially since he's so successful.  I didn't agree with all of his ideas, since writing is different for everyone, but I still appreciated them.<br /><br />I most enjoyed learning more about King's style in the \\"On Writing\\" section.  His suggestion to \\"read a lot and write a lot\\" actually comforted me quite a bit.  Ever since I can remember, no one has understood why I like to read and write in my spare time.  It's good to know that it's for good use.  I also liked how he explained his method of writing with the periods of the door being open and closed.  At first, his stage of putting the manuscript away for a period of time confused me, but I suppose for editing purposes, it is good to look at it with brand new eyes.  I just don't know if I'd be able to hold myself back.<br /><br />King's opinion on writing classes and seminars discouraged me a bit, since I'm going to major in creative writing at Farmington.  I understood his point - you certainly don't need a writing class or a major to be a writer.  That doesn't make me any less willing to major in writing - quite honestly, I wouldn't know what else to do with myself.  I just hope it won't be as much of a waste of time as King seems to make it.<br /><br />The \\"On Living\\" section was a bit horrific.  If anything, I'll certainly be more careful next time I'm walking anywhere.  It was a good, self-reflective way to end the novel.  Overall, the manuscript was an entertaining read.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is an aspiring author.t with brand new eyes.  I just don't know if I'd be able to hold myself back.

I just hope it won't be as much of a waste of time as King seems to make it.    The \\"On Living\\" section was a bit horrific.  If anything, I'll certainly be more careful next time I'm walking anywhere.  It was a good, self-reflective way to end the novel.  Overall, the manuscript was an entertaining read.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is an aspiring author.
0312430000|4.0|I had to read this book for a quality improvement class and I would recommend it to any student looking for a different perspective on healthcare quality improvement.  Gawande keeps the concepts simple and uses great examples of industries that have mastered quality through the use of checklists and continuous improvement.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I was a little bit skeptic after reading some of the other reviews, but I bought this headset because it was actually made for the PS3. I play COD Black Ops, but I can only play after my wife and daughter go to bed. Set up was a breeze. I have an audio out option on my tv. I think that I would have needed an extra RCA component (red an white) audio cable if my tv only had an audio in option (to run from the PS3 to the tv). I was considering the DPX21 headset that has surround sound, but I really don't need them yet for Black Ops. It really just helped to have full volume to hear footsteps, instead of the tv turned down to where it is barely audible. It has made the game even more intense for me.  I generally play for 2-3 hours at a time, and they are very comfortable. My face gets a little hot after an hour, but pulling them off my ears for about 2 seconds between rounds keeps me cool. The one thing that I noticed was that there is static when the volume is low, but I keep the volume pretty high for the gaming experience. My wife did say that she could hear it from about 6 feet away, although she had to listen for it. It was a great purchase for my purposes.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|My husband loves the blues and he was unaware of the existence of this CD. I ordered it for him and he was astonished that he like all the songs on it. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
0446519456|4.0|fast delivery and nice book to read. if you are interested in the after-life and/or reincarnation, i would  recommend this book to you.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|Sophie Marceau is magical, and the scenes, settings, music are all first rate. The plot is a tad predictable, but so are many classic themes, and the real test is how well they are done. This one has few false notes, and re notes, the score is so lovely I went to considerable trouble to find it and purchase it. This movie does have a bit of a Jane Eyre feel. The only slightly false note is the daughter is hard to warm up to, because her part is written so that she is really obnoxious, just a hair of jumping the shark here. But Sophie and the score are so wonderful you can ignore any minor hitches. This one is worth buying, and so is the score, if you can find either one. I wish there were more of Sophie's films available in the US if this is any example of their quality.
B00005O5CM|1.0|The DVD only played thru first 5 minutes of the movie. Then it stopped, I could go forward or skip scenes. What I thought was a good deal on an older movie was just a waste of money.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Pink is one of my favorit artists and I had trouble finding this one in the local stores and when I seen it on Amazon.com & just had to order it. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I actually saved money by purchasing it on Amazon.com even with the shipping.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I've looked for quite some time for a knife to add to my camping/BOB kit. After much research and deliberation I decided to go for the BK2. It was a long thought out process and I was a little aprehensive to purchase without actually putting my hands on the knife. I love the knife. It's built to last several life times.   The 1/4 inch blade looks like you could pry a door open with it and wouldn't hurt the blade. Came with a good factory edge though not razor sharp, but it's not supposed to be. Alot of knives come with a kydex sheath that seems to be an after thought. Not on this knife. Fits the knife well and has good retention. The sheath has plenty of carry options.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|I was sad.  The bluray disc just stopped playing at one point and even when I tried to skip past the freezing part, it still wouldn't play.  Great movie.  Poor quality control on the bluray manufacturing.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT movie that reveals the harm we do to others when we draw upon our OWN suspicions and conclusions of our OWN minds WITHOUT evidence to confirm our adopted \\"belief.\\"  However, a BRILLIANT and PERFECTLY-PLACED little \\"twist\\" reveals what damage we do to OURSELVES in the end!<br /><br />Normally, I like movies that DEFINE whose BAD and GOOD or  RIGHT and WRONG.  This movie FAILS my demand-to-know, but it FAILS so gracefully, that it really didn't matter who was \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\" in the end. While it leaves viewers with undefined DOUBT, it's what makes this movie unique and brilliant.  It is NOT your ordinary \\"busting the \\"GUILTY\\" as much as clearly revealing the damages and consequences of gossip, tale-bearing, meddling, and hell-raising without evidence!  It's like watching a LIVE PLAY.<br /><br />I didn't want to watch this movie.  I thought \\"Another priest abusing a child kind-of-movie.\\"  My sister wanted to watch it-so I bought it & watched with the family.  But, boy, I was WRONG!!  THIS IS AWESOME....and I didn't find any scene unsuitable for younger viewers...Enjoy!!
B0013N4AT0|5.0|After the new more modern sound found by Opeth in their last album \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\", they continue in the same style but in this album, Akerfeldt perfects his clean singing voice and it is used in prominently in most parts of this album. Once again, the bass playing of De Farfalla is hugely missed but there's no use of crying over spilled milk. Also, the way the music and the lyrical story concept of this album is connected is very cool. Best track without a doubt is \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\".
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought this headset to be able to combine game audio and team communications in one headset.  The headset delivers well on its promise. Only drawback is the fact that it is a wired headset but I didn't want to spend all the money on a wireless headset, since I only use it for gaming (BFBC2). I have a seperate high-end headset for my audiophile endeavours. Overall audio quality is as expected in the medium performance region but well enough for gaming. It produces a light background noise, that is prominent as long as there is no other audio but I don't notice it anymore when the game audio kicks in and the action unfolds.  Price is reasonable, comfort level is good and my ears are completely covered. The microphone boom works fine and will stay in place wherever you bend it. Nice feature set of controls, seperate chat and game sound levels, boost and mic mute.
B0007KTBIU|2.0|Disney's worst animated feature.  Somebody should've been spanked.  Don't base a movie on a historical figure and then dump all over reality in the process.  The story of Pocahontas is interesting enough without making the following unforgivable errors  1. Anthropomorphic animals - her friends are a hummingbird and raccoon of human level intelligence who show up from time to time to provide comic relief and instead provide headache inducing time wastes.  Whitey brings a haughty dog to round out the travesty.  2. Talking tree - I was hoping it was just her imagination, but no, you see Native Americans could talk to trees - trees who find Mel Gibson hunky  3. Magically learns English - how will they communicate?  Oh I know, we'll just have \\"the wind\\" magically teach her English and then just go from there.  Laziest...plot device...EVER!  Worse even than \\"it was all just a dream\\".  Somebody should have been double spanked for that one.  4. Natives are at one with nature, whitey just wants gold.  Who knows how many young minds were thrown off course for decades by this movie.  I'm not some Fox News drone who doesn't know my country's history.  The Native American's story is not a happy one.  But haven't we grown up enough to see both sides as humans?  Apparently not.  By positing the Natives as \\"magic\\", you're just reinforcing a view of them as inhuman.  Super human IS inhuman.  5. Love - the whole movie was built around this love device and yet there is no reason for them to even like each other.  This was probably the most annoying part of the whole film.  \\"It's worth dying to have just met you\\".  Who writes that?  Teenage girls and women with teenage mentalities.  Manipulative drivel, and it just goes on and on until you want to physically hurt the two main characters.  6. War bad - nobody wants war, but the whole conceit that the 2 sides were better off for having learned to live with each other - gee, it works in some stories, but here all I can help thinking is that if the Natives had gone ahead and wiped out whitey they would've saved who knows how many humans from untold misery.  It's not like we just agreed to \\"share\\" the land and lived happily ever after.  Anybody who left this movie with a warm fuzzy from that trite piece of plop needs a heavy dose of mondo reality.    Gee, and there's so much more.  John Smith has to go back to London to get treatment for his wounds, as if London in 1607 was a neighborhood hospital.  He'll be dead of septicemia before they're out of sight of land!  If he makes it back to London he'll die of the plague.  Lazy lazy lazy writing throughout this whole loaf of a movie.  I'm glad that Pocahontas could never go anywhere without applying a heavy dose of lipstick.  Her conditioner is working wonders as well.  She was able to read the instructions (rinse then reapply) after she magically learned English from The Wind.  Too bad The Wind didn't tell her what small pox was.  Did I mention how annoying the anthropomorphic hummingbird was?  I know I did, but I thought I'd just bring that back up.  Oh, and the stupid talking tree?  John Smith has a good soul, even though he's \\"handled\\" hundreds of savages on his journeys.  But I guess they don't count since they weren't as hot hot hot as Lipstick Babe.  Later on, he'll meet Anakin back at the orphanarium, and there will still be good in him afterwards.  The tree said so.  THE FLIPPIN TALKING TREE!    Gak...arg...splutter...fume.  Cannot believe this thing got made.  Cannot believe some super-talented people didn't feel like total tools as they spent months of their lives animating seconds of this stink burger.  Think of how many times they had to listen to lines like \\"Follow your heart\\" or \\"You must choose your own path\\".  I wonder if this movie was associated with a number of suicides.  I'm contemplating it myself at this point as this film has robbed me of my ability to experience joy.  Maybe I'll go cheer myself up by watching \\"Splice\\" or \\"Faces OfDeath\\".
B00005JPFH|5.0|I like to call myself a \\"Spider-Nerd.\\"  I've seen both Spidey 1 & 2, but have never seen Spidey 3.  Until just recently via Netflix Rental.  I've read reviews of this movie saying it totally sucked.  But, in my opinion, its not really as bad as most people think.  I liked Peter in this one.  He was a lot less mild-mannered.  Venom was just so awesome, by the way.  My fav part is the story of the Black Suit.  The Black Suit in the film looks way better than the one in the comics.  Overall,  Spider-Man 3 was pretty good.  Yes, it does have flaws, but not enough to make it totally suck.  I recommend this movie to anyonne who, like me, is the very definition of the term \\"Spider-Nerd.\\"
B00000IQV7|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I rented it and it was defective and I used to own it on VHS. It was time to update and get it on DVD. Love and recommend this movie to any and everyone!
030746363X|3.0|Tim Ferris has clearly gone to extraordinary lengths to test some of his theories on himself. Some of the science behind his theories seems sound, while other - shockingly inaccurate. For example - on page 23 he states that an hour long Stairmaster session burns 107 calories. I checked six different calorie calculators, and even though they vary in their estimates anywhere from 500 to 800 calories (for a 150 pound woman), none come even close to the measly 107 calories. I don't know where he got that number, and even if he had a good reason to throw it out there, he should have provided proof. Instead, Tim seems to do what most people do when they pull their numbers out of their a***s - they do what they need to in order to make the numbers appear to support their theories.<br />This was the first, but not the only place where I saw that he isn't particularly careful about his research. But perhaps the biggest fault I found glaringly obvious was that he based so many of his statements on his own reckless experiments. Let's face it - we are all different. A body of a 34 year old male who is fairly athletic and has spent many years ingesting a variety of what he calls body-building \\"stacks\\" (i.e. various substances of steroidal nature,) will respond to some of the experiments quite differently then let's say a body of  a 250 pound middle aged woman.<br />Another gripe - Tim's so-called \\"diet\\", which according to him will cause \\"rapid weight loss\\" is nothing but a low-carb diet with legumes allowed. Okay, I'm not usually critical of whatever anyone is trying to do diet-wise. My opinion - to each her own, not my place to judge. But if someone is going to make claims like \\"you will lose 20 pounds a month\\", shouldn't he give some sound science to back it up? Like, for example, why no grains, if legumes are allowed? He just says \\"No grains\\", with no apparent rhyme or reason. There's no long term plan, no explanation for how to maintain the weight loss if you manage to lose anything in the first place. His diet has pretty much the same issues as many other diets out there - it's restrictive and requires some serious will power to stick to long term. No earth-shattering revelations, and as far as his claim of \\"rapid weight loss\\" - well, you can probably lose some weight on this diet, if you manage to stick to it that is, but it's no better or worse than most low-carb diets out there. Calling his plan \\"Slow-carb\\" instead of \\"low-carb\\" doesn't change the fact that he expects you to restrict an entire food group. I'm also extremely skeptical of the \\"planned binges\\" - seems counterproductive at least and unhealthy at the most.<br />On a good side, some of the exercise chapters were somewhat useful. There are things in there that I hadn't known before and will probably try to implement in to my routine. That's probably the only reason this review has 3 stars and not 1 or 2.<br />Another interesting fact that does seem to be true is the \\"cold burns calories\\" theory. But to be perfectly honest with you, I hate cold! There's no way I am going to voluntarily subject myself to ice baths. That's plain torture. I'll take an hour on a Stairmaster over 20 minutes in an ice bath any day.<br />To put it plainly - many of the things he had done to himself are just plain nuts! But I appreciate his dedication to learning. I can definitely see the upside of him being the lab rat and me reaping the benefits of his experiments. But most of what he had done is purely a curiosity, never to be implemented by 99.9% of people who will read this book. That's my theory. I hope it's been helpful.anything in the first place.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This album really grew on me. It has a lot of hits on it. I liked her on SNL and I think shes very talented. Not sure why so many people are let down by this album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games literally left me hungry for more. Collins is obviously a literary genius. she weaves an elaborate and creative story line with the developing love story that leaves main character katniss in an odd love triangle. Perfect for teens hungry for a love story harder to put down then the twilight series or good for any harry potter fanatic with an amazingly creative plot line that could only come from the ingenious Collins.
B001QXZ81G|4.0|AN EXCELLENT MOVIE ABOUT A STRANGE THREE WAY LOVE TRIANGLE BETWEEN A COMPUTER, MAN, AND WOMAN.  PLAYABLE ON ALL REGION DVD PLAYERS OR REGION 2 PLAYERS. EXCELLENT MUSIC AND HUMOR. HAS ENGLISH   LANGUAGE SOUNDTRACK. BUD CORT IS THE VOICE OF THE COMPUTER.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an awesome book. At first it was hard to get past the setting and how cruel a world they lived in, but I ended up hooked. You will fall in love with these characters.
B00007E8V4|4.0|I've only listened to this one and hypnotize, but I thought this was quite a good representation of their sound.  I'm just a listener, not a critic, so I can't speak to the more technical aspects but I enjoyed listening to this.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|This movie was very entertaining. My girlfriend liked it and I didn't think she would. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but for the younger crowd enjoy. By this seller it came in a timely manner and product was perfect.
B000001EIA|5.0|Well sent
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I thought this book would be the best book. That I would love the characters even more than I did. This was NOT the case. It felt like either Suzanne Collins' heart wasn't in it or that she didn't know how to end it. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, and came out dissapointed. I hate to give it only 2 stars, but it was missing something. Bad ending to what could have been a series you want to read over and over again.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Just as in the movie, there is a certain longing behind many of these songs, which are for the most part performed solo by Eddie Vedder.  The lyrics don't feel true and personal, but they definitely fit the movie well.  Just like the movie itself, I found this CD to be pretty good, but not great.
0553103547|5.0|Started this series in December, am about to finish it. I was recommended this read by several friends and had been putting it off. Finally decided it was time-I wish I had read it ten years ago when I first heard of it.<br /><br />Everything is epic, in my top five favorite books.
B002JIOQCO|4.0|I was turned on to Andrew Stockdale when I saw him On the Tonight Show singing \\"By the sword\\" with Slash. I really liked this guys voice and style so started researching him  and found this album that met my expectations. It has 7 songs that I rated 4 to 5 star first time I heard them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow! Things sure do get messy in this one, but just like the first one, I couldn't put it down!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Contact has something for everyone.  Adventure, technology, romance, family, political strife, religion and of course Jodi Foster who has been a solid actress since she was young!  The streaming quality of this was excellent and I enjoyed it as much as when was I a teenager.    This should be one of your first rentals on Amazon!
0061703087|3.0|Anther story about out of control technology. I read this book in just a couple days. A hard to put down book, but in the end I only gave it 3 stars. Like most of Crichton's books I think it will make an alright movie (I'll watch it). I would put this book in my \\"fluff\\" category. It may not be \\"great\\" literature, but sometimes one needs a little fluff.
030746363X|1.0|We're not prudes whatsoever, HOWEVER, if we would have known that this man's book was laced with unnecessary profanity & graphics, we would not have ordered it. I actually cut the center section out as we have children who are 'readers' and our books are open to whomever to peruse.  I would actually send it back for a refund had I not gotten to it with the scissors.  We enjoy Dr. Oz's show but would like to have gotten a 'heads-up' of the aforementioned.  Clean up your act Ferriss........your approach to loosing weight and improving one's health is right on, but please....you might want to loose the 'potty' mouth and porn.  How 'bout a G version? or at least mark the cover with an R or X rating?<br /><br />Ok.....let 'er fly.
0307595579|3.0|I did enjoy reading the books and the video. However, I am very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. Lots of jumpy images and audio. Seems like a black market video rather than a professional copy.
B000HKL1QU|5.0|This was my first experience of Vonnegut. After a few pages I was thinking he was a bit...Um...\\"Brain Damaged\\". By the time I got to page 50, I saw he was a genius. He is a master at satire. One of the few books I could read over and over again.
0060507772|2.0|I discovered Terry Pratchett's Discworld series in May 2010, after avoiding it for many years. What I was missing! In the 9 months since then, I've read 34 out of the 38 books or so. And I have just purchased the other 4.<br />  I enjoy Mr. Pratchett's writing immensely, and especially, his sense of humour. I do NOT enjoy his choice of illustrations, but in the vast majority (and by that I mean every other book in the series), one has only to ignore the book cover. This one is a different format, and fully illustrated. And as I said, I DON'T LIKE the illustrations. I'd not seen the book before I bought it. It was another Terry Pratchett, so I bought it. The illustrations disturbed me enough that I set aside the book, and plan to give it away to friends who also love his work, but don't mind the decoration. I would go so far as to say that the subject matter could be disturbing to young children (I'm almost 54, and I find it disturbing!).<br />  Of course, I have Asperger's and that may account for part of the reason the unusual size and format of this book, as opposed to the regular ones, disturbs me so much. I had a problem with the trade paperback size as well, and only my need to read more of Mr. Pratchett's wonderful books forced me to accept them. Now, their size doesn't bother me so much. The few modest drawings in \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\", I actually like.<br />  In closing, I recommend all of Mr. Pratchett's books BUT this one, or any others like it (I don't know others like it, but there may be).
B003XU75QG|5.0|This album is one of the greatest rock albums of the year. Taylor s soulful lyrics get right to the root of rocken roll. Her voice is something that the second you hear it you have no idea that your talking to a 17 year old. I have been following this ban for a while now and when there album dropped out on the music scene it didn't disappoint.
B0013K2UCC|5.0|This album is a classic modern soul album. Legend's voice is excellent and lends itself well to the songs he sings. His talent as a songwriter is also high-quality. The album itself is very cohesive, flowing well, and maintaining energy throughout. It's quite well crafted. This is an album both for the masses and for the more critical listeners. There's enough catchy hooks to grab a general audience and enough music depth to grab music lovers. Only the most musically prejudiced people could find significant fault with this work of art.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was reluctant to read this series.  I'm not a fan of science fiction and I rarely read YA books.  When a friend gave me The Hunger Games, I left it on my desk for weeks.  Once I picked it up, I was hooked within a few pages.  Good writing transcends categories.  I would recommend to anyone, 7th grade and up.
B0043HA1K0|5.0|Wake Up! is not just my favorite album of 2010 - it's one of my favorite albums of all time. Take John Legend, one of the best R&B/Soul artists out there, and add the Roots, one of the best Rap groups out there, and you have a super-group capable of greatness. And greatness is achieved in this powerful musical presentation. The re-imagining of these classic soul songs, the musical delivery, and the created sound will take your breath away. The final work is a timeless classic. I look forward to the possibility of future collaborations between Legend and the Roots. I would recommend this album to anybody, but if you are a fan of Soul, R&B, Jazz, Funk, or high-quality Hip-Hop, then this album is an absolute must-have.
B00275EHJG|3.0|My Kids(boy-5yrs, girl 2.5 yrs) absolutely loved toy story 1 & 2. We watch them all of the time. We all couldn't wait to see #3. I had heard such positive reviews......BUT I WAS SO LET DOWN!!I still have toys from my childhood. I kept them so that my kids could love them too, and it gives me such joy to see my kids play with my loved toys. Why couldn't the story end that way!!!??? I don't know how many times I can re-watch a movie that is so emotionally depressing....I actually fast forward toy story 2, when the cowgirl remembers her person playing with her with sarah maclaughlin singing in the background, It rips my heart out...... this one takes it to a WHOLE other level of DEPRESSING!!!!! If you haven't seen it yet & are a big fan of 1 & 2 I suggest you rent it  first, then decide if you want to own this.....it's not so re-watchable......
B002ZG981E|4.0|I have seen a lot of questions about this having a digi copy.  Just got mine today and it DID have one but it expires May 6, 2011.  Good movie, worth every penny especially when you get all the different types of media included here!

B003INJETO|2.0|the sleeve notes to Road Salt One, Pain Of Salvation state \\"Road Salt is thirteen tracks of sweaty gravel, asphalt butterflies, untrodden paths and brave decisions. It will not beg for your liking, it will not make excusses, it will not carry you safely across dangerous waters. If you don't pick up its pace it will leave you stranded at the curb of the road. Yes, Road Salt One might indeed be a harsh lover, but if you have the guts to follow it whole-heartedly and dare to surrender to its rhythm, it will take you places you need to visit\\". Well if that doesn't set alarm bells ringing I don't know what will. It seems already that they're expecting trouble ahead from their fans and placing the onus on them to come on this journey with them.<br />You've got to admire Pain Of Salvation. Road Salt One is if nothing else a brave album, so far removed from the prog metal of past releases that they are likely to leave a large percentage of their fanbase behind. Admitedly POS's brand of prog metal didn't really sit well alongside the likes of Dream Theater, Symphony X etc and always stretched the boundaries somewhat but on Road Salt One we get nothing approaching prog metal. That in itself shouldn't be a problem if they'd come up with an absolute killer of an album but unfortunately this is not the case. While it's far from a total disaster it all too often drifts into uninspiring dullness.<br /><br />After the short and repetitive vocal dominated What She Means To Me it's straight into No Way. This is a promising start and turns out to be the best track on the album, but this blues fuelled rocker which towards it's close has an intricate time change/accent section turns out to be the exception rather than the rule. After such a thrilling start it moves into the slow blues of She Likes To Hide; yes, there's a definite seventies vibe going on here. Sisters is a rather dull piano led ballad that outstays its welcome. Next comes the gospel tinged Of Dust which thankfully is short. Better is Tell Me You Don't Know which starts as an acoustic blues which remains sparse even after the introduction of electric guitar. The improvement is short lived though as the off the wall Sleeping Under The Stars follows with its \\"Oom pah pah\\" rhythm if you catch my drift.<br /><br />The album is divided into what is titled side A and B. Side B starts with Darkness Of Mine with a vibe that musically matches the title as dark avant sections are interspersed between raw heavier guitar parts. Linoleum is the first really satisfying moment since No Way. Imagine Pearl Jam getting a bit clever and you'll be in the right area; a dynamic hard rocker. Also having a bit of a Pearl Jam vibe, though less satisfying is Curiosity. Where It Hurts is an atmospheric piece with a seventies rock feel and pretty good for it. Then it's Road Salt, a track that is already known for becoming a song POS submitted for a possible entry into this year's Eurovision Song Contest! Quite where that may have got them I dread to think but this electric piano and vocal ballad is not your typical Eurovision material. I have to say though that it's not bad at all. The album closes with the longer psychedelic blues of Innocence.<br /><br />As already stated, Road Salt One is not a bad album by any means. Nevertheless it weighs too heavily towards the average, occasionally poor, with only a few highlights to consider it a good one. Where this record leaves them is anyone's guess but if Road Salt Two which will apparently appear later in the year follows a similar furrow, and combine that with the poorly received Scarsick, their previous release, then POS could be in danger of their loyal fanbase giving up on them. 2 ½ stars.is Tell Me You Don't Know which starts as an acoustic blues which remains sparse even after the introduction of electric guitar. The improvement is short lived though as the off the wall Sleeping Under The Stars follows with its \\"Oom pah pah\\" rhythm if you catch my drift.     The album is divided into what is titled side A and B. Side B starts with Darkness Of Mine with a vibe that musically matches the title as dark avant sections are interspersed between raw heavier guitar parts. Linoleum is the first really satisfying moment since No Way. Imagine Pearl Jam getting a bit clever and you'll be in the right area; a dynamic hard rocker. Also having a bit of a Pearl Jam vibe, though less satisfying is Curiosity. Where It Hurts is an atmospheric piece with a seventies rock feel and pretty good for it. Then it's Road Salt, a track that is already known for becoming a song POS submitted for a possible entry into this year's Eurovision Song Contest! Quite where that may have got them I dread to think but this electric piano and vocal ballad is not your typical Eurovision material. I have to say though that it's not bad at all. The album closes with the longer psychedelic blues of Innocence.    As already stated, Road Salt One is not a bad album by any means. Nevertheless it weighs too heavily towards the average, occasionally poor, with only a few highlights to consider it a good one. Where this record leaves them is anyone's guess but if Road Salt Two which will apparently appear later in the year follows a similar furrow, and combine that with the poorly received Scarsick, their previous release, then POS could be in danger of their loyal fanbase giving up on them. 2 ½ stars.
B000002U84|5.0|To Beth's review of JT's work on Rio:  You must be crazy, sorry. Each member of Duran Duran contributed a unique sound to their music. Remove one, and the original Duran Duran sound is gone. If you feel that way about JT, then you must feel the same towards Roger's licks, Nick's amazing synth, and Andy's rocking solos. There is no way you can single out one member as distracting. Each one is their own voice coming through. It kind of sounds personal.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I highly recommend this CD.  It is the best darn stuff you could ever listen to on the entire planet.  I am addicted to it both day and night. When I do schoolwork in college, I am able to focus better.  I also listen to it while playing computer games.  My favorite songs on the disc are The Grid, Recognizer, Rinzler, and Disc Wars.<br />I am impressed with The Grid because it has the voice of Jeff Bridges saying the lines stated during the introduction of the movie when it played in the theater.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|While there are many who think this is a \\"man's\\" show, it's not true! I am a female and have adored this show since the very first episode. It's a very graphic show, but the era was a really graphic time. The acting is perfect, the drama, the fight scenes, it's all just great. Spartacus has become one of my favorite shows and I am eagerly awaiting for Gods of the Arena to come out to DVD now that it too is over and for the second season to be aired. WATCH THIS SHOW!
030746363X|5.0|I had some friends over for a dinner for my fiance's birthday two days ago and one of my friends asked if my jeans were new. They weren't and, in fact, I had worn them several times around the same friend before. This time, however, the jeans actually fit and look great, like they're supposed to.<br /><br />See, I was an athlete my entire life. Starting in my childhood, and through high school I played three organized sports, or more, each year. In college I played basketball several times a week with roommates. I was tall and lean and could eat without guilt no matter what. Once I finished college, however, everything began to change.<br /><br />I landed a cushy desk job and moved away from my normal workout buddies, so I grew sedentary. Not being 100% sure on how to deal with my burgeoning waste-line, I delved into the popular P90X diet and workout regimen. Following the plan to the T, I transformed my body into something that I was truly proud of. Even when I was in the weight-room for over an hour a day and doing football drills for another hour a day in high school, I didn't look as good as a looked on the backside of the P90X routine. However, the whole think is a daunting task. Nearly 10 hours of workout time per week plus a very strict diet that requires a ton of time and energy just to count/portion/maintain. Luckily, I had a work schedule that lended itself to the lifestyle; but when I got a new job, P90X became impossible for me.<br /><br />Over the next couple years, I lost the incredible body that I had after P90X and somehow got to a point where I was embarrassed to not wear a shirt. My clothes didn't fit well anymore and I was unbuttoning the top one (or sometimes two) buttons on my pants when I sat down! I was lucky enough to happen upon this book and sat in on a Q&A with Ferris, in which he encouraged me to do what works for me whether that's P90X or his new book 4-Hour Body. He said the trick was finding something that I could maintain - something that wouldn't cause me to YoYo.<br /><br />I bought the book that day and began to read and understand what I needed to do to give his weight loss plan the ol' college try. First of all, Ferris tells you to choose the section that you are most interested in: fat loss, muscle gain, sex life, among others. He says to focus your attention on that one section for some time until you feel you are ready to move on. Clearly, I needed to focus on fat loss and I've been doing that for the past 6 weeks or so.<br /><br />The chapters are easy to understand and the fat loss one clearly and concisely dispells some of the common misconceptions associated with weight loss. As an engineer, I looked to his testing and science for my peace of mind. The weight loss section talks about several aspects of his weight loss plan: 1) diet 2) supplements 3) temperature conditioning 4) there may be others.<br /><br />I have really only implemented number 1) in my daily life, since they get progressively harder to make part of your routine as they go (2 is harder than 1, 3 is harder than 2, and so on). The diet is interesting, and most resembles a typical no-carb diet. These can be dangerous when done in long stretches (read: dangers of atkins), but there is a trick to this diet which I will get to in a few lines.<br /><br />The other sections of the weight loss chapter are designed to get you through the last 5 to 10 pounds of loss that can be very tricky and stubborn. The last section is about managing and minimizing damage done during times of binge eating (holidays, days of weakness, etc).<br /><br />Utilizing only the tips and suggestions and guidelines Ferris sets forth in the diet section of the weight loss part of the book, I am happy to say that I have lost just under 15 pounds, which is about 8% of my starting body weight. My face looks much more handsome since the bone structure is clearly visible. What's more is that my clothes fit me again! I don't feel disgusting anymore. I've dropped about 4 and a half inches off my waist and about 2 and a half off each thigh. What's more is this is all without stepping a foot in the gym.<br /><br />Now on to the best part, I'm on a diet right now. This diet. But last Saturday, I ate 4 donuts, half a bag of cheetos, a Mexican pork dish, Spanish rice, some corn tortillas, and about 6 beers. Today (also Saturday) I've eaten a German pancake, corned beef hash, 2 eggs, some country-style potatoes, a package of thin mint Girl Scout cookies, some oreos, and a couple spoons of ice cream. You see, every diet has its cheat days. You always break down and cheat. With Ferris' diet, you MUST cheat once per week. In fact, it's a mandate, and without it, your progress will stall.<br /><br />Right now, I am sitting in my living room, munching on cookies writing this review. I'm 15 pounds lighter, I wake up much easier in the mornings, I never feel bloated or fat or gross, I have more energy throughout the day, and I'm WEARING A BELT on pants that I bought when I was 21!!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book. Read it, learn it, and follow it. If it doesn't work for you, then it doesn't work for you. It's not miraculous, and it requires commitment, but it IS easy and maintainable.

B00007K02F|4.0|Being my favorite book, I have as many versions of it's video releases as possible. Clearly a made for the movie theater version, it was, nonetheless, beautifully done, with fine acting and the re-working of the story, for it was a big re-working of the book, still provided the essence of the novel. If you're looking for Jane Eyre containing more of the full novel, you're better served with The Timothy Dalton version, but, for it's purpose, this release is excellent as well.
B003QSHIPS|5.0|In the past ten years, the Gorillaz have accomplished a lot in a short amount of time. Once conceived as a side project of Blur frontman Damon Albarn and \\"Tank Girl\\" creator Jamie Hewlett, ironically, got more attention and noteriety than Albarn's actual group. Their success is very surprising, given that Gorillaz isn't even a real band and they release a commercially viable album once almost every five years. While Dan The Automator produced their 2001 self titled debut, and Danger Mouse helmed their sophomore effort \\"Demon Days\\", this time around, the Gorillaz decide to produce the new album \\"Plastic Beach\\" themselves. On this album, they continue down the road of genre-bending madness, surprise cameos and all star guests appearances.<br /><br />Starting off the album is \\"Welcome To The World Of The Plastic Beach\\" featuring an unlikely cameo from Snoop Dogg. This album also has appearances from music legends from all walks of life.  Starting off the cameos are Bobby Womack on the first single \\"Stylo\\" and the ambient ballad \\"Cloud Of Unknowing\\", Lou Reed on \\"Some Kind Of Nature\\", and The Fall frontman Mark E. Smith on \\"Glitter Freeze\\". Even members of The Clash (Mick Jones and Paul Simonon) make cameos as well. A Gorillaz album wouldn't be complete without guest appearances from some of the most respected names in hip hop. De La Soul make their second appearance on a Gorillaz album on the catchy \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\", Mos Def appears on the aforementioned \\"Stylo\\" as well as on \\"Sweepstakes\\" and British rappers Bashy and Kano show up for the uptempo dance number \\"White Flag\\".  The album closes out with the rather brief \\"Pirate Jet\\". As much genre hopping that goes on with a Gorillaz album, sonically they play it straight through most of the recording. Much of the album bears a heavy synth sound throughout, though it's a pretty strong record musically.  In short, \\"Plastic Beach\\" is worth checking out.

0670022411|3.0|In A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES Harknes takes all the urban fantasy romantic tropes and...uses them. Main PoV character Diana is smart, orphaned, stubborn, beautiful-though-she-doesn't-know-it, and a powerful witch. Her vampire love interest Matthew is almost perfectly thoughtful, impeccably dressed, brilliant, rich, and well connected. The antagonists resent their blossoming romance because vampires and witches 'just don't mix' (Really! It's never happened before!). There's the trendy locales (Oxford, France, upstate New York), the wine/books/artifacts only a centuries old vampire could have, the tension between the supernatural races. If you've read your share of urban fantasy, you've seen all this many times over.     The issue isn't that Harkness uses these tropes over again--they are tried and true for a reason--it's that it's her first novel and you can tell. Her foreshadowing lacks subtlety. Last-minute contrivances fix issues. Too much time is spent on the minutiae of eating/traveling/clothing. Expository conversations are used to forward the plot. And the plot itself is bogged down with irrelevant information. You know, the kinds of things any writer's workshop would explain are problems because they affect flow and readability.     But do these problems ruin the story?     For most urban fantasy readers, those are issues that won't impede their enjoyment of the love story. However, while I enjoyed Harkness' blending of ideas and the magic, even if they aren't exactly groundbreaking, the execution made it hard for me to enjoy it on a level that would make me give an unhesitating endorsement.     The story starts off with a problem: why does everyone want Ashmole 782? Diana is a Ph.D. in history, an expert on alchemical texts, and during her research at Oxford she finds a text that has been missing for 150 years. She can tell it's special because it fires off all her witch's senses. But she's here as a scholar and not a witch, so sends it back, where it disappearsagain. Now every vampire, witch, and daemon in Oxford wants to know how she got it to appear and if she's going to do it again. Because its hidden text supposedly explains the origin of paranormal creatures--and perhaps even how to destroy them forever.     During Diana's research, Matthew Clairmont appears. He's mysterious and attractive, but he's a vampire. He's a scientist at heart, who wants to not only know the how but also the why. He claims to want to help Diana, and is interested in Ashmole 782, but his altruistic intention is suspect. Diana, against her better judgement, is drawn into Matthew's circle of protection. The other witches don't want anyone but another witch to ever obtain Ashmole 782, and see Diana's vampire-trusting behavior as a betrayal.     Then the dots start connecting: the death of her parents, the text, the motives of witches and vampires who are trying to keep Diana and Matthew apart. Harkness blends history, magic, science and alchemy into a story that sucks you in despite its awkward pace--because, really, you don't know where Harkness is heading with all this and you are compelled to know.     Harkness's prose is easy enough to read, and she handles the magic well, including the separation of the supernatural races, and even the 'science' of their behaviors. Even though some of it seems to be for convenience's sake (i.e., vampires awake and walking around during the day). My favorite part of the entire book is the sentient house where Diana's witch Aunt Sarah lives. It creates new rooms for guests, has temper tantrums, and hides/reveals things at the appropriate times.     The love story between the main characters is a strangely mixed bag of reality and contrivance. I wanted to want to see them together, and they seem to fit together as a couple personality-wise, but the execution made Matthew creepy and Diana wishy-washy. Matthew is an over-protective control freak and Diana is a 30-something Ph.D. who devolves into a lovestruck teen, which made me kind of embarrassed for my sex. It doesn't help, either, that it only takes them three weeks to decide this is True Love Forever.     While I was eventually able to enjoy the main characters, and even the plethora of secondary characters that are important in Diana and Matthew's lives, I couldn't get around the meandering storyline. Certainly there's forward movement as they fall in love, travel, and unravel the mysteries of Ashmole 782, but I look back and there's just so much fluff. I spent 500+ pages reading to remember all these details (historical, alchemical, etc), only to have them mean nothing to the story. If you asked me, I don't think I could pinpoint the exact climax of the novel (I think it was around the 2/3 mark, which is an awkward spot); then the last third of the novel devolves into a meandering buildup for an event that leads into what's obviously going to be a sequel. I guess we'll have to see if she improves with susequent novels.    **This review was posted on Elitist Book Reviews. For more reviews and interviews stop by our blog.**
B00000FCBC|4.0|In my opinion, this album started the decline of Metallica.  These are all remakes; some I'd heard the originals, some were new to me.  Anyways, many songs were given a unique Metallica twist that made them really awesome, like Whiskey in a Jar, or Astronomy.  And other songs just sucked (Loverman).  One important note is that the second disc contains stuff that has previously already been released, usually as a B-side to a single.  So you might already own some of this material.  Overall, if you're a Metallica fan, this is worth the money if you want to keep your collection complete.  But if you already have some of these songs from your purchase of their other CDs, then save some cash and just download the individual songs that you like.

B00006879E|5.0|Over time I've heard a lot about Maroon 5,a lot of it surprizingly negative mostly to do with the bands commercial popularity. But it all goes with an old saying I've almost always kept to:don't judge any artist until you've experienced their work-whether it be a painting,a movie or music. This album came to me via the used CD bin at a local video and used electronic store where they have an excellent \\"buy 2 get 2 free\\" CD deal and,to be honest I actually baught this only to complete the deal mainly out of curiousity. I wasn't expecting a whole lot so needless to say I was extremely surprised just how excellent this album is. And that is not only for the fact this is a debut release but also by virtue of the fact I realized upon listening to it that I had heard and enjoyed two songs from this album before even having heard it.<br /><br />  Those two songs in question are \\"This Love\\" and \\"Sunday Morning\\". Both are wonderfully melodic and well harmonized soul/funk based pop tunes that keep a style that does to a degree owe a lot to the Stevie Wonder/Jamiroquai/Brand New Heavies variety of retro soul but all the same have a very modern and unique style all their own to keep them fresh. The album opens with another type of groove called \\"Harder To Breathe\\" which,with it's harder edge and strong guitar lines and vocals from Adam Levine is a wonderful extension on the striking rocking funk combo that we heard from Lenny Kravitz over a decade before. The live \\"Not Coming Home\\" blends that sound with the moodiliy chorded and harmonically elaborate elements of their sound and songs such as \\"Shiver\\",\\"She Will Be Loved\\",\\"Tangled\\" and the well crafted \\"The Sun\\" all play out as many different combinations of this sound as possible.<br /><br />  As strong siphons of 60's and 80's rock n soul bands such as Electric Flag,Blood Sweat & Tears,Chicago,ABC and Hall & Oates Maroon 5 present us with a style of music making that is familiar but also unique and compelling all at the same time. They certainly aren't the commercial shills I always assumed them to be because of their high visability around 2003-2006 before the release of their sophmore release [[ASIN:B000P2A256 It Won't Be Soon Before Long]],by which time they'd bumped up the 80's new wave/pop/soul element of their sound. But there are probably very few debut albums in this millenium so far that are quite as fully realized as this and it certainly does give me an idea that the rest of their catalog is more than worth investigating.familiar but also unique and compelling all at the same time.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|For the price, these are a nice pair of headphones. I purchased these solely for Call of Duty. After a couple weeks, I decided to purchase the Ear Force DSS 7.1 which made a huge difference. The headphones sounded great before but I wouldn't say you could tell where exactly you were hearing footsteps from. However the sound was great and the mic works great as well. I do however, have a few complaints about this product.    1. Headphones seem to be cheapily made. The headphones are made of plastic. One day while playing, I tilted my head back and the right heaadphone broke off. Luckily, Amazon replaced mine for a new one. Turtlebeach also offered to replace my defective unit but I was able to get a hold of Amazon first!    2. At first, the headphones hurt my ears after a few hours of gameply. Once I got used to the headphones, it's not much of a problem anymore.    If you're looking for a nice pair of headphones which aren't too expensive, I would definitely recommend these. Beforehand, I was using a bluetooth for my online gaming. These are much better!

Seventeen year-old Lena thinks the cure is a good thing and eagerly awaits her procedure and evalutaion, which will determine her fate and her future mate. But all that changes when she meets Alex. From there on, her beliefs about the world are gradually turned upside down.    I'm in love with Delirium as I was Oliver's debut novel Before I Fall. Delirium is intriguing and emotional.

B000001GXL|5.0|This legendary performance is one of three concerti that Michelangeli and Giulini performed at the Musikverein in Vienna in 1979 (the other 2 were op.15 & op.73). The orchestra is the Wiener Symphoniker and though they are not the Wiener Philharmoniker, they play magnificently under Giulini's masculine, noble baton; these are defining performances.<br /><br />Concerto n.1: Perhaps the best of the set, this reading is completely Beethovenian and highlights the composer's idiosyncrasies, which Haydn--quite surprisingly--disliked in his pupil's first set of piano sonatas (op.2).  Michelangeli's sound and dynamic control are magisterial.  There are plenty of moments to cherish throughout; and any reviewer would have a hard time deciding which points to highlight.  Nevertheless, the first movement's cadenza, the phrasing of the entire second movement, and the lilt and gaiety of the third--especially the bounce of the theme of the rondo, which most pianists play slovenly, disregarding Beethoven's careful phrasing markings, which confer a characteristic 'bounce' to the theme--cannot but remain engraved in any listener's minds.  Under Giulini's baton, the orchestra is perfectly paced and is both thrilling and immensely expressive.<br /><br />Concerto n.3: The tempo of the concerto is appropriately slower than usual: the cut time on most printed scores score is a misprint, for it is not contained in the manuscript. Consequently, this reading is highly tragic and elegiac. Michelangeli, as often was the case in live performances, is in supreme form, with a sound whose suggestive beauty is unique. The first movement is permeated by a looming gravity that is both solemn and hovers impeccably--stylistically--between Classical and Romantic. The concerto op.37, in fact, was a turning point in Beethoven's oeuvre, for it is indebted to Mozart (the C Minor concerto K491 and even more to the B-flat concerto K450, whose unison triplets are practically transcribed in the development) and is at the same time unequivocally protended--sonically--toward Romanticism. Most performances of the work favor the latter aspect, disregarding the rigorously classical structure of the outer movements, thus undermining the concerto's complexity and keystone position of this work. The piano and orchestra match each other with supreme ease: that this is a live recording makes the ensemble work astonishing--especially striking is the end of the first movement. The second movement is an oasis of lyricism, which is unforgettable, with Michelangeli playing with an hypnotic sound the arpeggi of the development, which is a peculiar interplay between piano and woodwinds. The rondo is almost stinging in its rhythmic precision and sharpness.

Along with op.15, these are probably the best recordings extant of these works. The \\"emperor\\" concerto is the weaker of the series; though it is a magnificent performance, Michelangeli's playing is slightly staid compared to the live performances with Celibidache of 1969 and 1974, which are acknowledged to be among the greatest readings of op.73 of the 20th century, along with the 1961 live with Backhaus and Schuricht in Lugano.<br /><br />These renditions of Beethoven stand indefeasibly in the annals of recorded music.is at the same time unequivocally protended--sonically--toward Romanticism. Most performances of the work favor the latter aspect, disregarding the rigorously classical structure of the outer movements, thus undermining the concerto's complexity and keystone position of this work. The piano and orchestra match each other with supreme ease: that this is a live recording makes the ensemble work astonishing--especially striking is the end of the first movement. The second movement is an oasis of lyricism, which is unforgettable, with Michelangeli playing with an hypnotic sound the arpeggi of the development, which is a peculiar interplay between piano and woodwinds. The rondo is almost stinging in its rhythmic precision and sharpness.

B002ATVDIM|5.0|The characters are all members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and very well researched. After studying art history for years it was so much fun to see Rossetti and Burns-Jones fleshed out in such an authentic and endearing way and after 30 years as a painter I find things have not changed that much in the art world. Funny, insightful, authentic, and really hot sex scenes you would never see on US TV.
B003K5A6VK|4.0|I just watched the episode The Unicorn and the Wasp from the Complete 4th Series of Doctor Who which I downloaded from Amazon.com and I must pass on my thanx to Amazon for the ease at which this was done and the great pleasure I had watching the episode.  David Tennant is a thoroughly enjoyable Doctor and I must admit to being a big fan of Tom Goodman-Hill who played Reverand Golightly/The Wasp.  This journeyman actor is well versed in every type of acting chore in Britain from stage to screen and drama, comedy to musical endeavors.  I always look forward to his latest efforts.<br /><br />The whole cast of this episode was sparkling, Felicity Kendal as Lady Eddison, Fenella Woolgar as Agatha Christie just to name two others.<br /><br />The storyline as a Doctor Who adventure interspersed with a typically British mystery and one of Agatha Christies at that, was delightful.  The writing was full of wit and references to the obvious historical and fictional aspects of the Agatha Christie stories as well as some of the actual events in her life.  In addition the Doctor Who alien insanity and craziness blended very well.  All this and the usual great filming locations in the English countryside, whether real or just studio created were thoroughly enjoyable.  I recommend this one as a favorite Doctor Who episode.
788370091X|1.0|Do not buy this item. It is not the real thing. This is what i wrote the seller: I am very much upset. I received a package containing ONE dvd. TWO dvds were advertised. And the dvd that I received seems to be like one of those movies that are offered to be downloaded from places like thepiratebay or btjunkie, because the menu has been tampered with. The options are limited although many options are offered: various chinese audio optios. There is no option for deaf people. To me, this item seems to be a pirated copy of the chinese original - the one officially published in China. This is the one - the official Disney issue for China - that I expected to receive. I do not understand how Amazon is allowing that this type of merchandise be available on their site.  I would like you definitively to send me what you were advertising. I am sure that I could have downloaded the real thing from any of the web sites that I have mentioned. And it would have only cost me the price of a doble layer dvd and a little bit of electricity.

B0034G4OVS|4.0|Just got done watching Adam Greens \\"Frozen\\". This is the 2nd Green movie tat I have seen. The first was Hatchet, which was pretty bad. On the contrary, Frozen is much better. Unlike Hatchet, Frozen has a story that is more believable.<br /><br />The plot revolves around three college kids, on a ski trip, who try to save some money by bribing the chairlift operator (instead of buying lift tickets). After a long day on the hills they convince the chair lift operator to give them one last ride. Then through some believable miscommunication, the ski resort employees turn off the lift, with the three kids still on the lift. I don't want to give out what happens, but the movie will keep you frozen to your seat till the end... pun intended.<br /><br />Green has come a long way as a director. I liked the plot of the movie, the actors were good and their characters were likable and believable. I would compare this movie with the style of Eli Roths movies. Some parts made me laugh and some made me close my eyes.<br /><br />As a fellow New Englander, I'm pleased to see that Adam Green has developed so well as a director. He has a real passion for movies and it shows. Give this movie a chance. It's allot of fun.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|It all had to start somewhere, and here it is the first album of The Beatles.  I never experienced Beatlemania or listened to them on vinyl.  But I've listened to this album enough to very well know what I'm talking about.  Now this not The Beatles best album but it is still very good.  This album has 8 original songs written buy the songwriting partnership of Lennon-McCartney.  The other 6 songs are covers buy  50's bands.  Now the highlights of this albums are both original songs and covers.  From the bassline on I Saw Her Standing There to the harmonica on Please Please Me and Love me do it makes for a revolutionary album in it's own rights

B0025KVLRY|5.0|Let me say I'm a huge Beatles fan.  I have the stereo box set and the mono box set.  And I've heard every Beatles album start to finish about 3000 times.  Now this Beatle's album in my opinion is probaly the weakest.  I much prefer of the early albums,  Please Please Me or A Hard Day's Night but I'm not dissin this album or anything because it's a great album but it just lacks in some areas.  The highlights of this album are It Won't Be Long, All My Loving, Dont Bother Me, Please Mr. Postman, I Wanna Be Your Man, and Money.  Those songs are what makes this album 5 stars.  But the rest just feels like filler and kind of brings the album down.  But like any other Beatle's album it's great, but just not up there at the top.
0307595579|5.0|I read the first book of this series and really liked it, so wanted to continue reading them. If I like a series of books, I like to buy the set in hardback. I found 2 versions of this series in hardback and the other one was twice the price. I didn't want to spend twice the amount for the same books, so I got this one and I am really happy with it! The books remind me of old antique books, and I think that makes them really unique. I would recommend this set!
B003Q6D282|4.0|Well, the most touted & probably final installment of this franchise, does not disappoint its' die-hard fans. A boxoffice sucess! It turned over a tidy profit, so don't be surprised if Lionsgate decides to make more sequels! I thoroughly enjoyed this & it answered alot of unanswered questions that were nagging some of us for so very long.<br />It leaves you essentially at a point where the possiblity of a sequel is very strong.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable, with doses of some humour in between the gore & torture scenes.<br />The bottomline is always come clean about your past, otherwise it will haunt you!<br />Highly recommended!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Greedo shooting first.  Taking the magic out of the Force by giving it a pseudo-scientific explanation.  Stormtroopers explained by cloning a super-bounty hunter (except, apparently, his ability to hit what he aims at).  George Lucas has revised his masterwork to the point of incoherence.  I'm sticking to the DVD release of the original trilogy - as flawed as Mr. Lucas might regard these films, they are far more fun than the 'technological terror' he has constructed.  Hey, George!  What are you trying to push on us?

0393072231|5.0|What caused these comments is one from Publishers Weekly. To quote the remark, If you are going to read just one book about the crash maybe it should not be The Big Short.    Have read most of the books available on the crash and did not read TBS until about the last. It is enjoyable, vital, well written, technical in a way the layman can understand, and thoroughly interesting. My opinion is if you are only going to read one book about the crisis, this is the one that should be read.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm a huge Adele fan and had my doubts that she could outdo \\"19\\" but \\"21\\" is absolutely amazing.  There is such a huge range of musical styles on this album, yet it still has a cohesive feel.  I'd already become familiar with a few tracks such as \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" prior to 21's release, and they are glorious to be sure...but I find that my favorite songs on the album are some of those I hadn't heard before.  \\"Turning Tables\\" is almost tear-inducing in its beauty.  As a diehard Cure fan of 20+ years I would have cringed at the very idea of a young woman covering \\"Lovesong\\" but Adele pulls it off with flair and soul.  This album is gorgeous and you need to own it!!
B004DK5CW4|3.0|When watching Secretariat, I couldn't help but think it was not so much about one of the greatest horses who ever graced the race track, but more of a film that tries to take the film Seabiscuit and simply transport it 30+ years later.  The movie tries to make Secretariat seem like an underdog when all along the horse was seen as a champion.  No one in this film struggled for money.  The training of Secretariat would have made for a good film but only horse race champions would have been interested.     The horse racing scenes are amazing, but all in all this is a film you don't need to see.  There are better movies out there!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|I have a soft spot for female heroines who fight bravely and sacrificially despite overwhelming odds. \\"Winter's Bone\\" follows such a character, 17-year old Ree, played with understated power by Jennifer Lawrence--a deserved Best Actress nominee at this year's Oscars.<br /><br />Ree lives in the Ozarks of Missouri, where she is raising her younger brother and sister, while their mother sits lifeless and emotionally paralyzed in a chair. Ree is resourceful. She teaches the kids to hunt, to skin a squirrel, and to look out for family. They are miserably poor, scraping by day to day, but things get worse when Ree gets a visit from the local police. The officer explains that Ree's father has put up their property to post bail, after his arrest for cooking meth, and if he doesn't appear at his court date Ree's home and land will be taken away. Refusing to show fear, Ree insists she will find her father and she sets out to do just that. Soon, though, she realizes her relatives scattered throughout the mountains are reluctant to let her stick her nose into their business. The tension mounts as we realize she is putting herself in greater danger by poking around. But what else can she do? If she doesn't do so, she and her siblings will be without a home or livelihood.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence plays the role to perfection, exhibiting a gritty survival instinct and backbone, yet revealing understandable fear and reservation. It's a fine line, and she walks it well. The relatives are scary people, and the script gives them believable dialogue for the setting and social status they inhabit. Ree's character finds financial and emotional support from an unexpected source, an uncle known as Teardrop--played by John Hawkes, and also deservedly receiving an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />The movie simmers with tension and violence, but shows very little of it until the latter third, during which Ree gets her answers--leading to a bittersweet redemption. It's a movie as cold and tough as its title, and it stayed with me for days. Reminiscent of other small, indie films such as \\"Frozen River,\\" this movie deserves the recognition it is receiving. While I don't know if it qualifies as a Best Picture, it certainly stands tall on a strong script, great acting, and reminders that poverty and drugs are a scourge not only in inner cities but in reclusive settings as well.its title, and it stayed with me for days.

B003UESJH4|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />On one level, 'The King's Speech' hits a home run in its moving depiction of how speech therapist Lionel Logue corrects the stammering speech of an arrogant Duke of York and transforms him into now confident monarch (and well-rounded good guy), King George VI. On a much different level, 'The Kings Speech' has a harder time in accurately depicting the true historical circumstances of the king's transformation and the complexity of the political machinations surrounding his ascent to the throne.<br /><br />The creators of the film admittedly took liberties as to the accuracy of the time it took Logue to correct Albert's (The Duke of York, aka 'Bertie's') speech. The film informs that Albert met Logue in 1934, when they actually met earlier in 1926. And within seven months, in 1927, under Logue's tutelage, Albert already showed marked improvement in a speech given to the Australian parliament in Canberra. The film, of course, would like us to believe that it wasn't until 1939, when the WW II had just broken out, that the King finally found his mettle. But it's also possible that the King had improved but then regressed at a certain point, requiring additional instruction on Logue's part. I recently heard Colin Firth remark that he listened to a public speech given by King George as late as 1938, and it was not at all impressive (actually downright embarrassing!).<br /><br />Fiddling with the time line as to how long it took Logue to truly shape the King's speech, is not such a big deal in comparison to the film's distortion of history regarding the political sympathies surrounding the Abdication and the Royal family's attitude toward Hitler. The film hardly calls attention to the fact that Albert's brother, King Edward VIII (later known as the Duke of Windsor following his abdication), was a great admirer of the Nazis (even after the war broke out). What's more, Churchill (played by a completely miscast Timothy Spall), despite having arranged a coalition against the Nazis, inexplicably supported King Edward during the Abdication crisis. Not only wasn't King George a friend of Churchill during the time of the Abdication (for the obvious reason of Churchill's support of his brother) but soon afterward sided with Churchill's political opponent, Neville Chamberlain, who advocated a policy of appeasement toward Hitler. 'The King's Speech' would like us to believe that King George was always against the Nazis, but such an attitude did not emerge, until the war broke out.<br /><br />Despite the historical inaccuracies, 'The King's Speech' pulls us in through the story of a unique and engaging relationship between student and teacher. The opening scene, where Albert must speak publicly for the first time at Wembley Stadium in 1925, establishes the extent of his malady--a stuttering problem that proves to be the source of profound embarrassment for both the Royal Family themselves and the public at large.<br /><br />When the Duke of York meets his therapist, Lionel Logue, the contrast between the two could not be more profound. While Logue exudes a child-like spontaneity, 'Bertie' is uptight and arrogant (Logue's grandson maintains that his grandfather never swore in front of the King nor did he call him 'Bertie'). As their relationship develops, Logue tries to get Albert to see the connection between his stuttering and repressed upbringing. Albert opens up enough to reveal how he had to cope with his strict father and had to endure the family's insistence that he suppress his natural left-handedness and correct a knock-knee condition through the use of painful splints.<br /><br />It's the Abdication and its consequences that causes the 'dark moment' of the Second Act of the narrative. After David (King Edward) accuses Albert of trying to take over the throne by attempting to make himself more competent (via the speech lessons), Albert becomes completely tongue-tied and is unable to reply to his brother's humiliating taunts, which he endured so many times during his childhood. Then when Logue suggests that Albert can be king, the Duke of York ironically takes his brother's side by accusing Logue of offering up a suggestion that could be construed as being treasonous. The Duke belittles Logue for his failed acting career as well as his lower middle class upbringing.<br /><br />Facing the prospect of making the most important speech of his life, the King eventually realizes that he needs Logue's help and seeks him out again. When the King apologizes, we realize that the king has had an epiphany. The act of 'eating humble pie' brings the King back down to earth; he now finally realizes that he's no better than his subjects despite his royal standing and can now relate to Logue as an equal and not a superior. And Logue must eat a little 'humble pie' of his own when the King reproaches him for likening 'The Stone of Scone' to an outdated relic. Logue comes to respect the institution of the Monarchy as it is now ably represented by King George, who exudes a new found confidence in his position as regent.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush steals the show in his wonderful depiction of the empathetic and iconoclastic speech therapist. Although he bears no resemblance to the real King George, Colin Firth does an excellent job in conveying the King's inner turmoil, as he vacillates between arrogance and self-knowledge. I wonder if the film's producers might have considered Guy Pearce for the part of the King himself as Pearce bears a striking resemblance to both the Duke of Windsor and King George VI. I actually wanted to see more of him in the film. Helena Bonham Carter doesn't have much to do as the King's wife and I can't understand why she was nominated for best supporting actress.<br /><br />'The King's Speech' ironically is a tale about the oppressed becoming the oppressor.

B004M3H17Q|3.0|James Blake is another shining star from Great Britten.  On his debut full length effort [[ASIN:B004M3H17Q James Blake]] ,  Blake mixes the best of electronic music, R&B, pop, indie-rock, and minimalism to make an effort that is truly unique from anything else. It is not perfect, but there are enough shining moments to make this effort a `standout.'<br /><br />The album opens up strongly with \\"Unluck,\\" which features superb electronic production work and a nice combinations of various music styles.  Here, Blake uses several vocal tracks in tandem with one another and sets the mood and the tone of the album.  Moody and alternative in sound, James Blake establishes his signature sound from the onset making the listener excited for what is to transpire as the album progresses.  \\"The Wilhelm Scream\\" is enjoyable, though is hampered by its length.  The production work has a nice low-key vibe and much like the first cut, Blake's vocals are low-key and not necessarily the main attraction of any of the cuts from this album.  The minimalist approach is appreciated, differentiating this solo effort from a number of other efforts on the market to day.  The soulful harmonizations of the vocals is a highlight of this standout.<br /><br />\\"I Never Learnt To Share\\" is captivating as well, but its length makes it a bit overwrought.  The a cappella opening vocals are a nice touch with the eventual inclusion of music completing the artistic palette.  The minimalist vibe proves to be a mainstay for Blake, making the lyrical substance of this track minimal as opposed to the maximal focus. \\"Lindisfarne I\\" uses the vocoder, which is the highlight of this cut.  The concept of the track is alluring, but the cut itself is a bit too boring and spacey. Similarly its follow-up, \\"Lindisfarne II\\" is big on the conceptual, but a pure oddity even for the most adept, deep listener.  At this point, one wishes that Blake's focus on the atmosphere and music would also trickle into the lyricism of this effort.<br /><br />\\"Limit To Your Love\\" is a brilliant cover of a Feist tune.  Spacier than Feist's version, Blake is truly clever here with his electronic experimentations and his soulful vocal performance.  The album's best cut, \\"Limit To Your Love\\" is the persuasion point for purchasing this conceptual, mysteriously beautiful effort.  \\"Give Me My Month\\" is more interlude than anything, clocking in at under two minutes in duration.  \\"To Care (Like You)\\" is a `B' cut, which features some great vocal effects and use of electronics, but does not dare supersede the greatness of cuts \\"Unluck,\\" \\"The Wilhelm Scream,\\" or \\"Limit To Your Love.\\"<br /><br />\\"Why Don't You Call\\" is another `interlude' you might state, focused more on the conceptual than an overt vocal performance from Blake.  \\"I Mind\\" is a bit of a breath of fresh air, without being absolutely show-stopping by any means.  Closing cut \\"Measurements\\" finds more soulful and overt vocals from Blake, which is a step in taking `James Blake' out of the `middle-of-the-road' categorization.  The gospel quality about \\"Measurements,\\" mixed with the electronics is certainly a non-standard mash-up.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004M3H17Q James Blake]] is a solid debut effort that is flawed by too much indulgence into electronic conceptualism.  There are highlights - namely the valedictory \\"Limit To Your Love\\" - but there is that lack of lyrical development that makes this album have some incredible \\"blah\\" moments despite the experimental vibe.  Blake's next effort should work to extend upon his lyricism as the musicality is already in place.Limit To Your Love\\" is a brilliant cover of a Feist tune.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele accumulated a strong following of fans given her soulful debut, [[ASIN:B0018QOIXU 19]]  Adele pulled off mass upsets at the 2009 Grammy's when she won Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for here exceptional hit, \\"Chasing Pavements.\\"  Adele's image has since grown since here nearly platinum certified debut, and sophomore LP [[ASIN:B004EBT5CU 21]] is on pace to be one of 2011's biggest hits.  Commercial aspirations aside (the album is a projected #1),  '21' is an exceptional, well rounded effort.  There is very little to quibble about, and if anything, Adele's already stunning vocals have grown even more stunning and standout.  Sure, some material pales to the very best here and on her debut (there is arguably no \\"Chasing Pavements\\"), but regardless, Adele sounds so refined, it would not really matter.<br /><br />\\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is a sharp contrast to \\"Chasing Pavements\\" or \\"Hometown Glory\\" from '19,' but it is a truly great contrast.  Written by Adele and co-songwriter Paul Epworth, \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" is an instant classic with its strummed guitar, big drums, vintage sounding piano and feisty lead vocals. \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" channels 1960s folk, pop, and R&B and synthesizes the diverse styles perfectly.  The songwriting is exceptional, with the chorus standing out the most: \\"We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me), Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), You had my heart inside your hands (You're gonna wish you had never had met me), and you played it to the beat...\\" Grammy-worthy? Definitely.<br /><br />\\"Rumour Has It\\" is equally exceptional, bringing in stand-out producer/songwriter Ryan Tedder (of One Republic) to further accentuate Adele's sound.  The production work is exceptional, unsurprisingly given Tedder's consummate successes with Beyonc&eacute; (\\"Halo\\") and Kelly Clarkson (\\"Already Gone\\").  Tedder's signature `big drums' mix harmoniously with Adele's full voice.  Another home-run, Adele is on a roll.  \\"Turning Tables\\" keeps Ryan Tedder along for the ride in this wonderful mid-tempo ballad.  Sans percussive accompaniment, \\"Turning Tables\\" instantly reminds one of Adele's previous hit \\"Hometown Glory.\\"  The songwriting continues to standout, particularly the dramatic bridge: \\"Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior, When the thunder calls for me, Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior, Standing on my own two feet...\\"  Three for three - that is all that can be said.<br /><br />\\"Don't You Remember\\" is no miss either,  continuing to showcase the finesse that embodies Adele.  \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" continues in the vein of \\"Hometown Glory\\" without superseding it with its minimalistic piano line.  \\"He Won't Go\\" is a true standout, following solid listens from \\"Don't You Remember\\" and \\"Set Fire To The Rain.\\"  Here, there is no question this is a neo-soul song, given the soul aura is given off from the onset with its incredible production work.  \\"Take It All\\" finds Adele teaching a vocal masterclass to say the least, with the great nuances about her powerful vocals.  The upper register of Adele's voice is as powerful as her bluesy lower and middle register.<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Waiting\\" may be the slightest bit overproduced, but makes the smart move to contrast the tempo of the churning \\"Take It All\\" in favor of a faster speed.  The sound is vintage all the way, which matches the lyricism.  \\"One And Only\\" finds the British soulstress `taking the listeners to church' with the gospel-vibe given off by the production work.  The only quibble is one wishes for the gospel choir to come in at the very end of this lengthy cut and complete the emotional build-up. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and stand-out.  \\"Lovesong\\" finds Adele channeling a cooler, more restrained vibe - though she does it with perfection.  \\"Someone Like You\\" ends the album ok, but not as exceptionally as the album opened.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004EBT5CU 21]] is a brilliant effort.  It is not perfect, but it is easily one of the best albums to bow in 2011 if not the best as of yet.  Adele has a prodigious talent and one hopes she continues to showcase her brilliant voice for years and years to come. 4 stars.fect, but it is easily one of the best albums to bow in 2011 if not the best as of yet.

B001ECQ6E2|5.0|This by far has been one of my favorite movies over the years.  For it's time this movie broke the mold.  True some of the acting is lacking, in fact, quite humorous.  For an example, Nero's Queen, complete with her two pet Cheetas uses the term \\"Via Rome\\".  I just died laughing.  The plot though was excellent, the scenes produced in Rome & costumes are out of this world, and also ask yourself how many movies now days where you actually see this many extras in one movie (well over 10,000 people).  There's nothing like seeing the real thing instead of a bunch of computer animated junk.  Also what most don't know about this movie is it was the first big blockbuster religious epic to determine if this genre was going to do well.  In other words, if this movie didn't do well we may never have seen Ben Hur, The Robe, Barrabas, and of course The Ten Commandments come to the big screen...at least during this time, when Hollywood used real people as extras.  Peter Ustinov and Finlay Currie both deserved awards for their performances IMO.  The giant, Lygia's guardian, is also Max Baer's (Jethro Bodeen on the Beverly Hillbillies) dad in real life.  The theme of the movie deep down relates to us all who believe in God.  The title is technically:  Quo Vadis? meaning \\"Where goest thou Lord?\\".  Yes technically there is a question mark behind the title.  Enjoy this masterpiece, it's well worth your time.  The only real disappointing thing about this transfer is for whatever reason it's not on widescreen.  What a shame, because some of the coliseum scenes, Nero's Palace interior and the burning of Rome scenes would have been awesome.  What were they thinking?  Of course, in comparison with the other religious epics this one is priced much lower.  Now I know why.  It's well worth collecting for your religious epic library.
B003WMX3SY|5.0|...Then this is your case. I read a few reviews and also checked out the video reviews on youtube and such. Looked like an interesting design. I used to do a lot of lan parties and wish i had this case back in the day.<br /><br />Large case with lots of airflow. Only downfall to this case, you can see EVERYTHING inside. If your a wire nazi, you may not really like the openness of this case.<br /><br />I found the case easy to work with and really like the Black and Yellow color scheme.
B003JVH7XU|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time on Netflix, not knowing how it would be. After seeing the movie, I went to Walmart at two in the morning and bought it. That's how amazing this movie is for people who like fighting movies.  The story is great, the action and fighting scenes are more than stunning, and it is very easy to get attached to the characters. I knew it was a straight to DVD movie when I saw it the first time, but I still do a mental double-take every time I watch it, and wonder how it never made it to the big screen. If this isn't proof that you don't need a hundred million dollar budget to make a great movie, then there is no proof. I'm writing this review after my third purchase of the movie (the one I mentioned, one for a friend and now the amazon instant watch copy so that I can play it on any computer I'm at). You are doing yourself a favor by watching this movie, and hopefully you buy it so that WB will make more of these movies.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I first heard Mumford & Sons on the Grammys and I instantly got goose-bumps.  I had to get their album and hear more.  I am not disappointed.  I have been playing it over and over all day and have yet to get tired of it.  I love their harmony and all the instrumentation.  They are true musicians! It has instantly become one of my all time favorite albums.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this album.  Phenomenal!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of the movie and given it was filmed in the 1950s it really stands the test of time.  Both from the storyline, the special effects and the enhanced quality for BluRay.  If you've never seen this movie and love Sci-Fi, you need to see it.  If you have watched it before, see it on BluRay and enjoy anew.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|When I first heard about the show I thought it would be interesting, and of course I'm going to watch it because I loved Blood and Sand. However, I didn't expect it to be anything amazing, and certainly nothing near the original Spartacus. I was wrong on both accounts. Not only was it an incredible show, but it rivals the first season in my opinion. One of the main reasons I thought it wouldn't be as good, is the fact that I assumed that because it was a prequel series there would be no surprises. That couldn't be further from the truth. This series provides just as much suspense and surprises as its counterpart. Without giving away the ending, let me just say that it was completely different from what I expected, and far exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this to any fans of Spartacus: Blood and Sand.[[ASIN:B003PIUC02 Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]]
B001TH16DI|5.0|I watched each of the original cast Stra Trek movies in theaters when they came out.  I then pruchased them as soon as they arrived on VHS (remember those?).  But in BluRay, it's like being in the theater again or better.  These movies are incredible and look and sound even better.  Star Trek is a classic that you will never get tired of.
B00005OB0E|5.0|Wow this is the Diana Ross compilation Every fan should own! Here in the United States this wasn't released but it should have been. Starting off with the song \\"Chain Reaction\\" which was a huge hit In England back in 1987, I realized this was the best track listing that has been put together so far for the money. This collection covers all the bases, from her motown supremes era all the way through her big solo hits in the 80's and 90's. Diana Ross has always been much more appreciated in europe and the uk, I hope that people here in america realize again what an amazing voice and talent she really is! I definitely give this collection five stars, this is worth every penny and a must have. Much better and all encompasing than what has been released here commercially. My cd came brand new in mint condition.
0316098337|2.0|I thought I would love this book but there were two issues... (1) It's written from the perspective of a five year old sheltered from the world for his entire life however he often uses caveman style language which is not believable for a variety of reasons. (2) The story drags on as if you are reading a blow-by-blow of the day in the life of two captives diary-style for just a handful of days as opposed to really building to anything. The entire story feels as if it could have been written as a condensed short story for a magazine and been much more powerful - this is an example of less would have been more.  Had I read this in a magazine, I would have definitely looked for other work by this author. As it stands, I found myself leafing 5-10 pages forward many times searching for something to happen and weed through the monotonous play-by-play.  Sure the breast-feeding five year old leaves you squeamish which the writer beats to death the entire book, but otherwise your waiting. I expected to enjoy this book as it felt like it was probably based on a true story, but it just ran around in circles until an abrupt ending. I will give this author another try, but this book was a thumbs down unfortunately. Great title but the depth wasn't there.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|Plus side: skilled use of dialog, interesting creative form (\\"autobiographical\\" voice mixed in with third person narration), character development was fleshed out in a way that makes it seem immediate, current, relevant, timely.  Down side: character development is good, but I found myself thinking \\"who cares\\"?  The characters seem to have, to my mind, little to no redemptive value, just \\"one damn thing after another\\" floundering along in their lives with no moral compass, but maybe that is the point of the story, I don't know.  My lack of affinity for the characters made it a tedious read at times.  Nihilistic in tone, I found it somewhat depressing.  Franzen is a good, maybe great writer, but I just could not relate to his characters, and I really tried!  Nevertheless, worth a \\"three star\\" rating, I do not regret reading, got to find what the fuss was all about.  I tend to think the work overall is a bit over-rated.
B00005JOA0|2.0|If you read the book, you can interpret things as you wish. While this is a largely tragic story to begin with, at least in reading it, you can find some bits of joy here and there, which offset what is otherwise a pretty miserable situation the primary character (Tara Fitzgerald) is exposed to. I know about the weather in Northern England, but the sun DOES shine there sometimes. Apparently, the director chose not to shoot on any sunny days. While the scenics are beautiful, when they are only used on overcast days with low contrast film stock, they don't really offer much. Nice set design, costumes, and some good acting are what made me give this 2 stars and not one. Even if you are some sort of always upbeat person, this production will probably bring you down. IF you like it visually, there is still the music to be dealt with. Frequent violin, and sometimes flute music, with long, drawn out, somber notes, add to the misery. Don't show this DVD to anyone who is already depressed, or it will probably be the last thing they ever watch, if you know what I mean. I have the impression that the first day on the set, the director said \\"OK, no one is allowed to smile until after the wrap party\\" and apparently, no one did, until the film was in the can. I understand that this is supposed to be drama, not comedy, but just as some comedies do not represent real life because they are too silly, this did not represent real life for being too joyless. I don't think that during weeks when I had close relatives die, that I was ever as miserable as many of the people in this movie.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|This was a very good, solid western.  Good cast of characters, good acting,  multiple story lines within the movie, but not hard to follow.  Very believable...  It had it all... the good guys, the bad guys, Native American Indians and, of course, the girl.  I really enjoyed it and would really recommend it if you like westerns.  Good job Ed Harris!
B004L3AR0K|1.0|I saw this in the movie theatre -- it got great reviews and I was very disappointed by this movie.     Basically, there is a lot of nudity and lots of beauty shots of Jake.  Other than that, there is not much to the movie.  I'd skip this one.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this film back before it was released, I thought the character design and the story looked a little weak. I'm glad I took a chance and preordered this film because nothing could be further from the truth. 'Despicable Me' is a wonderful heartwarming and funny movie, but it may be a little too intense for the youngsters. Steve Carell lends his voice to the main character and gives this film a lift. The animation style is better than I first anticipated and even the simply illustrated minions have much more character than they first appear to.......in fact everything about this film just gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />I had a similar reaction to 'Planet 51' when I first saw the trailer and that film turned out to be much better than expected too. This film may not be quite up to Toy Story 3's quality, but it's a first rate animated film. The Blu Ray looks great and there are some interesting extras including 3 shorts involving the characters from the film.

B00005YUNY|5.0|I am a little baffled by some of the bad reviews for this concert DVD. 'Yes - Symphonic Live' is without a doubt a winner all the way around. The orchestra only adds to the magic of this inspired performance that features some beloved classics as well as some very impressive newer songs. I kind of lost track of Yes in recent years as well as many classic bands during the early 2000 period. After watching this video, I have since gone back to fill in the blanks. When I watch stuff like this, I am saddened by the knowledge that bands like this are going extinct. There is so little out there in the world of music that will be remembered in 20 years. 'Yes' is a band that has stood the test of time and has only gotten their due from the legion of fans that know great music(and musicians)when they here it(them).<br /><br />'In the Presence of' is probably my favorite performance on this DVD with it's sweeping melody and inspirational lyrics. Even someone who isn't very spiritual will find it hard not be moved by this beautiful piece of music. Being a bass and guitar player, it would be nice to see more of Squire, but most bass players get the short end of the stick when it comes to camera time on video anyway. We also get some good shots of the orchestra which seem to really be into the music and do a fine job enhancing, but not overshadowing the core band.<br /><br />I recently saw an edited version of this show on HDNET which looked awesome. The DVD looks very good, but seems washed out by comparison to the HD version which is not available on Blu Ray....yet. These guys aren't getting any younger, but they play here with inspired feeling. Jon's voice is in great form, Squire is.....well he's Chris Squire, one of the greatest bassist ever....ditto for Howe on Guitar! While either plays like a teenager anymore, they both can still play with the best of them.<br /><br />The sound quality on this set is very good, maybe a little brassy when turned up really loud, but the mix is even and I could hear everyone fairly well. The second disc is a bit of a disappointment as the feature is pretty lackluster and the video for Don't Go is almost like watching the concert version again....hardly enough to dedicate an entire disc to.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this 'Yes' concert and you're a fan, then you should really like this one....just don't expect 'Yes' performing like they're in their 20's.ld hear everyone fairly well. The second disc is a bit of a disappointment as the feature is pretty lackluster and the video for Don't Go is almost like watching the concert version again....hardly enough to dedicate an entire disc to.

B000N3T0DW|5.0|Anyone who loves Spanish movies needs to see this one. Even if you don't know Spanish, the subtitles are sufficient in understanding and enjoying the story. The cast is almost entirely female, as it focuses on women's problems in family situations. Penelope Cruz is the main actress, and she carries a lot of responsibility in the film, both as an actress and the character Raimunda.<br /><br />Various situations develop in the movie simultaneously, and they interlock with one another at different parts. One story is that of Raimunda's mother, who supposedly died a few years ago, but was rumored to be appearing as a ghost. Another issue is what to do with Raimunda's husband, whose sexual perversions literally cost him his life. Then there's a dying friend who keeps asking Raimunda to find out what happened to her mother, and a neighbor who wants Raimunda to look after his business while he is away. You learn important information about these subplots gradually, and the surprises make the entire film excellent.<br /><br />The bonus features were a little disappointing. There was some material about the famous director, Pedro Almodovar, and his work involving Penelope Cruz, but it wasn't all that interesting. It would have been nice to see some commentary from the cast members or the writers. But all in all, the movie is worth watching!

B002I9Z89Y|3.0|I got this and the plastic case was broken, it did not click closed!  The flimsy blue plastic case may be to blame but if this was broken it shoud NOT have been shipped to me in the first place!  These sets also make it hard to read the episode list, it's on the inside cover and blocked by disks and the clear blue case.  On top of this a few days later the price on the 3 season set drops another $20! Not happy.
B0036OS3Q0|4.0|These boots are great. They keep my feet warm, they're comfortable and I love that they come in purple (my favorite color). They're also very light. I usually hate Crocs because I think they look extremely goofy, but these don't at all. Normally I wear an 8.5, but I read the other reviews and bought a 9. They fit perfectly and there's room for thick socks. The only downside is that I wish they were a little taller.
B0001EFTVA|4.0|`Tokyo Godfathers' is another great anime film from Satoshi Kon.<br /><br />When three homeless people in Tokyo find an abandoned baby their lives are turned upside down as they struggle to look after her and find her parents.  A variety of seemingly unrelated events come together until the film reaches it's heart warming and satisfying ending.  Traipsing all over Tokyo they follow various clues in their hunt for the babies parents, whilst their own life stories unfold before us.<br /><br />The dysfunctional homeless family make for humorous viewing, with an old geezer for the dad, a flamboyant gay man as the mother and a bitter, yet sensitive, girl as the `daughter'.  There's makes for a complex but touching family relationship.<br /><br />The animation is very good and whilst not as lush or beautiful as Ghibli films, this is more gritty and realistic.  This film has a 12 certificate, but this is an animated film aimed more at adults.  The themes, language and some scenes are more adult orientated that other anime films out there.<br /><br />This feels quite bleak at times due to the winter landscapes and muted colours, as well as the storyline in general. But, it is very well made and everything comes together perfectly at the end.  If you are a fan of anime films in general then this should please you and if you a fan of Satoshi Kon in particular, then this should leave you delighted.  A worthy addition to your anime film collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002LCOQVO|5.0|The theme of this enchanting work from 1977 is travel, giving the impression of a continental train ride with constantly changing scenery.<br /><br />The overall style resembles their popular track [[ASIN:B000007U6V Autobahn]], with the same hypnotic qualities but with a wider symphonic scope. The vast melodic sweep provides its most memorable moments in songs like the lilting Europe Endlos and the title track, which reminds me of Bowie's [[ASIN:B00001OH7U Station to Station]] in its chugging rhythms.<br /><br />The most explorative instrumental passages occur on Hall Of Mirrors whilst Metal On Metal and Abzug are both reprises of Trans Europa Express with industrial and dub undertones.<br /><br />Franz Schubert is a beautiful melodious instrumental which recalls the atmospheric work of [[ASIN:B000007TWJ Peter Baumann]] and this magnificent album concludes with Endless Endless, a brief reprise of Europe Endless. This is electronic music at its very best, hypnotic and engaging. Almost as great as their masterpiece [[ASIN:B000087HXM Radio-Activity]].
B002WOZKY8|1.0|I had to listen to this since my 7yr old daughter wants it.  I don't really know how to judge this kid's music because there is so little music in it.  Get rid of the Autotune and the programmed tracks and if there's anything left, I can judge that.  Who really knows what talent this kid has if he cannot actually showcase it on his album?  He seems to be mostly packaging--good looks, a little talent, and mostly good production and marketing.  For the mature music listener, this just won't cut it.

Again, I kind of fall into the same category, but it's to tell the people who won't go to the forums.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The magical story of Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a delight. This re-telling of Hans Christian Andersen's tale of the little mermaid is original and filled with humor, sensitivity and just a little bit of suspense. In Miyazaki's version a young boy discovers/rescues a goldfish (little mermaid) and they become fast friends, mischievous companions and finally heroes united against chaos. The animation is beautifully done and the story captivates our large family from ages 8 to adult. A must see if you enjoy animation, japanese manga or heartwarming tales. We watch this one again and again.

0316017922|4.0|This book reminded me of John Donne's famous words, \\"No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.\\"<br /><br />\\"Outliers\\" points out that none of us reached this point in our lives by ourselves; we are all part of an interconnected web of political, social, economic, cultural, genetic, and other forces that are constantly in play. Even seemingly \\"self-made\\" leaders \\"are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot.\\"<br /><br />For example, two young men were born with an unusually high I.Q. One grew up with an alcoholic father and only one outfit, leaving him naked whenever he washed it in the family tub. The other grew up in a wealthy family where he learned how to be assertive, savvy, charming, persuasive, and other traits correlated with success. The first was frustrated after trying in vain to convince college administrators to make a minor schedule change that would allow him to continue in college, and he dropped out. The second tried to *murder* his tutor, but he convinced the administrators to be lenient in their discipline, after which he graduated and went on to have a highly successful career. So success does not necessarily go to the person with the highest I.Q. or the greatest skill; many other factors are in play.<br /><br />I think statisticians might have an issue with Gladwell's post-hoc methodology, and business leaders might be frustrated that the book offers few actionable tips for success. However, if you approach the book with simple curiosity about some interesting patterns in the personal histories of successful people, you might find it a very interesting read.<br /><br />At the very least, I think \\"Outliers\\" is a reminder to be humble and grateful. Each of us would be a different person if we had been born into a different family in another country with different teachers/mentors/friends, different genes, significantly less money, fewer opportunities, or just plain bad luck. Although the book points out that history's most successful people tended to work \\"much, *much* harder\\" than their peers, no one can succeed alone. No man is an island.ors/friends, different genes, significantly less money, fewer opportunities, or just plain bad luck.

B004132I4S|5.0|I'd never heard of Sufjan Stevens in my life. Today, a friend of mine lent me this CD and I think it's simply mind-blowing! If I were to compare it with another album (which is nearly impossible because I'd say this album is unique), it would be Bj&ouml;rk's second album \\"Post\\". While Bj&ouml;rk's album has a strong industrial/electronic sound, Stevens' is more ethereal/futuristic/epic. In addition, Bj&ouml;rk's album sounds from the 90's; Stevens' album definitely features a \\"new era of music\\" sound. I admit that this is one of those hate-it or love-it albums. I can't picture anybody saying \\"hmmm... it's OK\\".<br /><br />Hallucinating & mind-blowing is what comes to my mind when I think of this album.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I have hundreds of blu ray discs and its always the animation ones that always look the best. Megamind sets a new standard for animation on blu. Toy Story trilogy was the best looking blu ray by far, but Megsmind to me, blows the others away! The clarity in this 1080p presentation is phenomenal! I cannot get over the detail. I kept getting lost in the imagery, I forgot to pay attention to the movie. And not only is the video awesome, the Dolby Tru HD sound is 7.1 and is spectacular on my 6.1 receiver. I still can't get the best of the soundtrack due to lack of HDMI input on my audio receiver, could only imagine how better this soundtrack could be! The surrounds and subwoofer is really used. If you have blu ray player, do not think the DVD 'upconverted' will be good enough. Wrong! You cannot add video image that is not even there in the first place. I get fed up when people settle for so less when it comes between DVD and blu ray. Hands down, blu ray is FAR superior and this blu ray of Megamind proves my point. It is outrageously awesome!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Your favorite toys are back in toy story three. toy story three is about what happens when andy goes to collage. I think this movie is great. The original cast is back except Jim Varney(Who Plays Slinky Dog In The first two) R.I.P., and some new cast like the legendary whoopie Goldberg and Michael Keaton who plays Ken. This movie is well made. It is true that it is kind of a sad movie. but i think it needed to be told to conclud the toy story movies. Is this the last? Probably so. well all in all eveybody had a good ride and people will mess these characters. I think alot of people can relate to this movie. Even The villians story was sad, you probably would turn sour if someone left you behind and then you found out that they replaced you. The movie had a great ending even though it was a tearjearker. All in all this movie was awesome and it will be a Disney Classic.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and I first played this game at a friend's house. We promptly went home and purchased it. We have since introduced dozens of friends to the game, and guess what? They all went home to purchase it too! I play a lot of games, and this is one of the best I've ever laid my hands on.    Positives:  1. The game keeps every player engaged throughout. Unlike other games, you have a stake anytime anyone else playing takes a turn. When another player rolls, you can still collect resources and trade. So, there isn't any time to get bored!  2. The game changes every time you set up the board. This provides for a new experience every time you play, which is phenomenal.  3. It's kind of like a cross between Monopoly, Risk, math puzzles all put together.  4. It involves a lot of cooperation among players, even though you play by yourself. This game encourages positive interactions between players, and is unlikely to end with the board being thrown at anyone's head.    Cons  1. It is difficult to explain to new players. Just hand them the booklet and then start playing. They'll figure it out. And by the time they do, you'll be on your way to victory and the newbies will be on their way to buying their own game.  2. It is somewhat time-consuming to put the board together, and there are a lot of pieces that can be easily lost.    Overall, a FABULOUS game!

B000CNFC76|5.0|Very inspiring movie about a boy who stands for who he is and doesn't let the big shots get in his way. Learning to play golf and going to the top. Also the learning of respect in the family and the relationships between the members of the family and the consequences of everyone's actions in the learning experience. It's not just all about golf, it's a great movie.
B000AAP7FI|5.0|This 10-CD set has well over 200 original boogie-woogie recordings, from the 1920's into the 1950's. All the great original masters are here: \\"Pinetop\\" Smith, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis......    The only real drawback - and I knew this before ordering - is, outside of the name of the artist and the title of the tune, there is not a speck of discographal information - no recording dates or places, no personnel listings, which means doing some research, especially on the Big Band boogie cuts. Since I own an extensive boogie discography, this is not a real hassle - actually, it's a great memory test.    As for the sound quality, some of these recordings date back to the late 1920's, and the sound on those - even on more expensive collections - has never been great, but compared to a few major label CD anthologies, I don't hear any major flaws.    Most of these recording will be immediately familiar to longtime boogie-woogie fans, but there are a few that I have not had on CD, and they add to the set's overall value.     The discs are encased in printed cardboard sleeves, which does an adequate job of protecting the CDs - and these are in a compact, heavier-cardboard container that seems durable enough.    For the price, this is a very good set.
B00377V6J2|5.0|As a big fan of SRV, who owns everything he's recorded, This is an awesome addition. Lots of great music and fasinating conversations between songs.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have to admit that when I first started reading the book it was tough. I wasn't at all a fan of reading from a 5-year-old's voice, however it quickly grew on me and I wouldn't want it any other way. Jack's view of the world is mesmerizing. This book is one of the best I have read within the last 12 months.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he absolutely LOVES it. He's a pretty big XBox gamer and likes 1st point shooter games the best. The surround sound quality of the Ear Force headphones are so good that he claims he is playing better and can hear. He even uses the headphones when no one else is home! A plus for me is that they block out all sound so I can't hear a thing! Its a win win.
B0017OB12O|5.0|I saw this classic many years ago in a downtown San Francisco cinema and it blew me away.  Since then I have seen periodically and the film has never lost it's luster to me. In fact seeing now in Blu-ray, it has gained even newer perspective in it's themes of militarism, honor and the madness of war as when the camp doctor rails at the end, \\"It's madness, madness\\".  William Holden was added to the movie so that the film would gain an international following since he was the number one star at the time and in retrospect, it was a wise move to contrast his cynical American soldier/sailor to the disciplined, high principled Colonel Nicolson, superbly played by Alec Guinness who was thought of as a light comedian due to his many successful Ealing comedies.  As Holden put it, \\"Alec received the glory, but I became rich (thanks to a percentage deal)\\".   Nevertheless this film will hold up for the ages and the Blu-ray transfer is even better than when it was shown on HD Net Movies.  If you love war films and classic cinema--do check this one out!
B003UESJHO|3.0|There are two separate and independent ranges of acting: one that spans like a spectrum from comedy to tragedy; the other covers all angles of a type of character. For example, Jack Nicholson has probably covered every imaginable  aspect of an angry person: the comedic, the dramatic, the tragic, etc. Actors like Robert De Niro is marvelous in plots of comedy, drama, tragedy, etc. Great actors thrive in their chosen story telling: character driven or plot driven.<br /><br />Christian Bale covers angles of a psycho. For him, his character in this  movie is another aspect of such persona. It's disturbing to watch, but the talent is evident.<br /><br />Amy Adams is thriving in starkly different contexts. She rightly deserves the best supporting actress Oscar this Sunday.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie did not entertain me. Maybe because Mark Wahlberg's character simply did not countervail Bale's--pun unintended. This is not Wahlberg's fault, the story was designed this way to accentuate the inner struggle of the big brother, who saw his little brother in his inner mirror.
B0049GYXDG|3.0|I thought the Blu Ray version would be in widescreen, but it is not.  This release is far inferior to the Sleeping Beauty release.  Sleeping Beauty had 7.1 surround sound and was widescreen, this is not, even though it is a latter release.  It's a classic, no question, but I don't seem the point of having the Blu Ray verision. It seems like an upscaled dvd on a blu ray disc.  Definately a dissapointment since most Disney Blu-rays thus far have been incredible.  It's worth buying if you only have it on video, but I wouldn't bother upgrading to blu ray if you have the DVD version. Hope that Jungle Book comes out soon on Blu Ray and gets the Sleeping Beauty treatment.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I've never seen this movie but it looks great, the blue and orange cover really makes me wanna watch it. is it based on a video game? I played a video game once. I almost died but I used a potion
B00003CX9S|4.0|The movie is great for teachers who have read the book in class with their students and would like to watch it with their students. I love Anthony Hopkins in this movie. Good acting all around.
B00007K02F|5.0|Zeffirelli's a genious who makes Italy proud abroad: He's the best when it comes to turn literary classics into movies for the big screen and for tv. Jane Eyre is an example: perfectly faithful to Charlotte Brontë's novel, in this movie there are deep passion and mistery. It's moving, romantic and intriguing!!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Though Adele had great success with her 19 project, 21 is the music soul pleaser of 2011! Not everyone will appreciate the stripped down sound, but it showcases the powerful vocal ability and true skill set of this 22 year old singer! Hands down on the album \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" is one of the most powerful tracks on the project! Well done Adele. If you can't appreciate this album, good for you! It's not meant for everyone, but for me it's like a fresh breath of air for the music industry. Again I say well done Adele! Maybe I can convince the Bermuda Government to bring you here for the Jazz Fest....:)
B004DK5CW4|5.0|We are huge horse race fans and Secretariat is the standard upon which all other race horses are evaluated so creating a movie about him was a tremendous challenge.  Fortunately the producers of this movie succeeded.  They managed to build a compelling storyline and embellish it with rich cinematography while capturing the heart and soul of this amazing animal.  I highly recommend this film.
B002ZG9940|4.0|This review originally appeared on my blog the Independent Ethos, on wordpress. This movie was also one of my favorites of last year. This is what I wrote...    With the American, Anton Corbijn follows up his debut feature Control, a movie about Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, with a thriller far removed from the music world where he first made his name. It seemed odd that an artist so attached to music (Corbijn has been involved in rock photography, album art and music video for over 30 years) would all of a sudden turn to directing no one less than George Clooney in a suspense movie, yet Corbijn hinted as much in an interview promoting Control back in 2007. \\"I'd like to do another film, an action film with more tension, a thriller, if you like,\\" he told contactmusic.com.    Corbijn has indeed delivered on that, but he has stayed true to the slow-paced seventies-era feel of Control, which felt like an animated version of his many photographs of Joy Division. It certainly seems ironic, having started his moving image career making music videos for that thing that revolutionized movies, MTV. It turns out Corbijn has produced a film that goes against the tropes of what many expect of a contemporary thriller. Despite the A-list Hollywood actor fronting the American this film comes from a world of the more atmospheric cinema of European cinema (Corbijn is Dutch after all) and, again, the seventies (just look at the poster art that seems to recall the feeling of films like 1974's the Parallax View). The American fills a viewer up like a fine and tenderly cooked meal, instead of the usual greasy junk from Hollywood that only tastes good in the mouth, but soon enough makes you want to throw up.    There is a mesmerizing pace to the American. Corbijn allows the camera to linger longer on the takes, impregnating the scenes with emotional and psychological depth. You get a chance to watch the actors act, whereas current Hollywood directors would take the easier way out with tightly associated cuts on focused images (see Michael Bay). Corbijn goes against this sort of lamebrain manipulation that insults the intelligence of the audience to make a rich experience, and Clooney adapts to the pace with amazing skill. As Jack, the titular American with a shady past, Clooney invites the audience in to his character's thoughts, a dark place to venture as the film lays out in a sudden burst of violence at the very start.    Clooney plays Jack, an agent with an unnamed organization, whose business is killing. He sets out for that all-too-familiar last job. His assignment takes him to a small, labyrinthine Italian village where he falls for a prostitute (Violante Placido), who returns the sentiment, and befriends a priest (Paolo Bonacelli), who himself knows about walking that difficult line of morality. Even though Jack is all too familiar with the dangers of becoming emotionally attached to innocents, try as he might, he can help but accept these souls into his life during a job that inevitably proves very risky.    As great a performance Clooney unleashes on the screen, Corbijn deserves the credit for giving this story, based on Martin Booth's novel A Very Private Gentleman, the respect it deserves as a satisfying thriller. There are five or six distinct moments of pulse-pounding action, which could never be as thrilling as they turn out to be had they not been sandwiched between deliberate moments of stillness, hence the film's dynamic, almost musical quality.    Most key are scenes where Corbijn lets the camera linger. During these moments, Corbijn composes images not unlike the photography with which he first made his name. They are images that play with light and dark and focus on a subject who carries a weighty presence. Corbijn's blog where the still image at left is taken from, features more still images he took on the set. They have been compiled in the companion photo book, Inside the American.    Appropriately, and very much like a European movie, the dialogue in the American is very sparse. Some might fault the film for this, saying it results in little character development and a confusing plot. But there is something to be said for the mystery it invites. Hollywood movies are so caught up with exposition, it can sap the mood out of a film. What Corbijn does is impregnate his images with a delicious sense of mystery that offers to stimulate the mind instead of deaden it, as most action pics oblige themselves to do.    Who knows how well this film will do ahead of the Labor Day weekend, where viewers will also have the choice to see Robert Rodriguez's Machete, a take on another kind of 70s film: the decidedly less cerebral exploitation film. I doubt the American will even surpass the Expendables, the Sylvester Stallone ensemble action flick that had dominated the box office two weeks in a row. No wonder Focus Features has decided to open the film a couple of days before the weekend. For those who want their action served with some intelligence and a deeper sense of atmosphere, there is always the American, and God bless Corbijn for coming up with that alternative.
0380715430|1.0|I enjoy reading Bill Bryson and how happy I was to find a book of his which I had not read before. Alas, I was in for some severe disappointment. Written in the usual entertaining Bryson style, it is a comedy of errors. And, sorry to say, unlike some reviewers seem to think, a nice writing style is no excuse for basic factual mistakes.   There seems to be no page without a mistake. And most of these mistakes could have been avoided by simply using a dictionary. I am not a linguist, therefore just a few mistakes which even I could recognize. Bill Bryson claims that the Germans say 'bumfodden' for toilet paper - I barely can imagine the merrymwent when next time in germany I will proclaim that there is not enough 'bomfodden' in the restroom.   The Japanese do not write hiragana (a syllable based alphabet) above the Kanji (Chinese derived characters), except in beginners teaching manuals. Rather the hiragana denote grammatical parts of the sentence and are not written above any other characters. Can Italians really not distinguish  between niece and granddaughter? Yes, they emphatically can. That 'Schadenfreude' (the joy of seeing bad things happen to others) is indicative of some flaws in the Teutonic sould is not only insulting, it also negates a whole tradition of Laurel and Hardy movies which seem to be based on the premise that it is joyful to see bad things happen to others.  Bryson, to his detriment, is amazingly chauvinistic. English adopts foreign words but other languages expropriate English words. English is, due to its virtues, predestined to become 'the world language' - I guess that Romans felt the same for Latin, the French felt this way at the time when even German Kings preferred French to Latin, and German scientists certainly believed German to be the language of the future due to its innate virtues, when, in the 1920s and 30s German was the universal language of science.  Surely the multitude of words in English cannot only be considered as a virtue- some people might believe that to have several words for the same thing might be actually not such a good thing at all. Bryson furthermore convieniently overlooks the fact that agglutinating languages, which can form totally new words by simply joining exiisting words into oen new word, have a virtually unlimited vocabluary.  Having lived in a street named after the inventor of Esperanto, Dr. Zamenhof, I do not appreciate that Bryson cannot get the spelling of that name right. Zamenhof can be spellt in many ways (Samenhof, Zamengov), but Bryson manage to add his own spelling.  Thus as a brief summary - avoid this book. That even a superficial reader like me can find so many factual errors cast too much doubt on all the facts, factlets and theories which he brings up.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I feel this way every time I finish a series of book with the same characters: empty. I won't get to peek behind the door and see what is happening to these characters that have become real to me.<br /><br />The events that began with The Girl Who played with Fire are concluded and wrapped up neatly at the end of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. Only a few items, that were briefly mentioned in all three books, aren't concluded but the reader won't feel like anything is missing. One can see how Larsson wanted to go further with these characters though perhaps it wouldn't have been a good thing if he did. We'll never know.<br /><br />Hornet's Nest starts off slow and details Lisbeth's recovery and the building to the events that end the trilogy. I'd say that it starts off a little too slow because it took me a week to get through the first half of the book and only two days (a night and the following morning) to get through the last half.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire could not stand on its own without this book but this one was my least favorite - Played with Fire was my favorite.<br /><br />If your reading this review you know that you love these books already so go pick this one up if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed.
0893860220|5.0|I like this passage from John Walker's review: \\"I'm a lifelong learner and I've been reading all kinds of 'spiritual' books for 40 years. I've noticed that even the most beautiful and enlightened teachers have a way of talking *around* the Ultimate...but Nisargadatta has a way of taking you right INTO It.\\"<br /><br />I feel the same way, and this is what is so special about Nisargadatta. This is a must have, priceless book, the best ever on enlightenment. I had not encountered his conviction anywhere, and it helped me to see that continual enlightenment was possible, rather than just temporary states of exaltation. I had been a practising adept of the western magickal tradition and a Thelemite for 13 years, and this book came at the right time and helped me to cross the abyss, to become enlightened, to self identify with the eternal self looking from out within rather than the small \\"I\\" self looking from the separate place out.<br /><br />The only thing missing in Nisargadatta's teaching I feel is the structure behind the enlightenment process, which may be gleaned by such diagrams of the Tree of Life and the cakra schema.
B003PIUC02|5.0|its very good action series  the series on amazon was a very good price than other and its blu-ray i didnt find in others place not be afraid buy it
B0046UGSNS|4.0|If our experience with Amazon's \\"Insta .... n...... t .... Vi ..... D .... eo\\" is any indication, Netflix has nothing to worry about.<br /><br />For God's sake, somebody tell Jeff Bezos to buy some servers!<br /><br />**********(UPDATE DECEMBER 2012) What a difference ... I forgot that I'd written this review and wish I'd updated this a long time ago. We haven't had an issue with Amazon Instant Video in ... forever. I can't remember the last time it hesitated, paused, or pixelated. We have many choices for streaming rented online content in our home (Apple, Vudu, Sony PS3, Amazon, etc...) but without fail our choice is always Amazon. Clearly, Jeff Bezos knows how to build a service like this from the ground up. A few minor start-up hiccups aside, Amazon has put the right people in the right place to make Amazon's online video content an industry leader.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|The Terminator (Blue-ray) was send in a very short time to me. It was my first order an I'm very happy!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Like many others, this was the first Jillian workout that I tried. I was a runner and considered myself in good physical shape, but it had been years since I had done any strength training beyond the occasional yoga class. Last spring, I developed bad allergies for the first time in my life and could not run outdoors. As I detest running on treadmills, I decided to try a workout video instead of my usual running. After doing some preliminary research, I decided to try Jillian's 30-Day Shred. I figured that I would breeze through level one, and possibly level two as well, and quickly move on to level three. Boy, was I wrong! The first day, I tried level one - without weights, as I did not own dumbbells. I'm ashamed to admit that I was shouting and swearing at Jillian long before the end of level one. The next day, I thought I was going to die, but I powered through it again and vowed to beat Jillian at her own game. I bought some dumbbells and worked my way through the three levels over the next couple months. Anyone who actually does this program in 30 days has my admiration!    I have since purchased Jillian's other videos, expanded my workout DVD library to include other trainers, and made strength-training a normal part of my exercise routine. I still love running, but I have a newfound love of other sweat-inducing activities as well. Knowing what I know now, I'd rate this DVD as a great introduction to Jillian as a trainer, a great introduction to circuit training, and a good (but short) all-around workout. It is good for the beginner, and if you stick with it, you'll definitely see results. I don't know about getting 'shredded' in 30 days or looking like Jillian, but you'll definitely see changes in your body if you stick with it for a while.     If you like Jillian and enjoy this DVD, here's a quick rundown of her other DVDs (just my two cents, of course):    Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism: A great 50-minute cardio workout, divided into 7 or 8 circuits. It's a solid workout for days when you don't feel like going outside or to the gym, but your muscles are sore from strength training the day before.     No More Trouble Zone: Love it. Commonly considered the 'sister workout' to BFBM, it's about the same length, but focuses on strength training. It's a good Jillian-style full body sculpting workout with some great moves.     Yoga Meltdown: Not a traditional yoga workout. Jillian puts her own spin on yoga practice, leading you through some yoga-based moves in almost-cardio paced reps. It's not for everybody, but if you like yoga fusion workouts and Jillian, you'll probably like this. I enjoy it, but don't find it to be very difficult, compared to some of Jillian's other workouts and compared to some of my favorite yoga workouts.    Six Week Six Pack - This one is probably my favorite Jillian DVD so far. It's a tough core workout with some great moves that you don't see every day. The format is a little different from other Jillian workouts, because you do all the moves once and then repeat rather than doing several circuits, but I think the difference in format keeps it interesting.    Shred it with Weights - Do your homework before buying this one, as other trainers have criticized Jillian's form as dangerous (check out youtube reviews). I bought this one and tried it a few times before the reviews came out, and I really couldn't get into it. It's an overall strange workout and the possible danger factor is not cool. This is definitely the one to skip.     Good luck and have fun!
B003XUBWYM|3.0|I was rather disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. It didn't seem very true to the way Jane Austen would have written it. While character development and plot were fine it seemed too modernized. While the lead female character (Fanny Price) is very strong and true to the way Jane Austen wrote her heroines, there were some rather risque scenes that Jane Austen would not have put in there. So bottom line- the movie was fine but not very true to the book I'm sure so therefore, I would not recommend this version of Mansfield Park.
0765360969|5.0|After first hearing the name 'Brandon Sanderson' in conjunction with the finale of The Wheel of Time, I quickly devoured (and LOVED) Elantris and moved on to Mistborn. Even after loving Elantris and having high hopes for the Mistborn trilogy, I was still rather cautious about starting a trilogy by a new writer whose work I was largely unfamiliar with. Regardless, I picked up the first Mistborn book and was not disappointed!    I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the BEST book by a new fantasy author - indeed, by ANY new author - that I've read in ages. The biggest draw, as other reviews mention, is definitely the magic system, and that only improves as you continue reading the trilogy. Brandon has built a detailed and well-thought-out world that is not quite like anything else I have ever read. It is simultaneously post-apocalyptic and pre-Age of Enlightenment. Very unique and interesting. The characters, however, are probably Brandon's strongest point after the magic system. Over the course of the book, the characters are surprisingly well-developed, which only impresses you further after reading the other two volumes of the series, in which the characters' true story arches are revealed. Brandon handles multiple plots and viewpoints with grace, marking himself as a far more accomplished writer than his resume indicates.     I LOVED this book and the other two books of the Mistborn trilogy. Most of all, I applaud Bradon for taking risks with the fantasy genre - you'll see what I mean when you read his work. All in all, a fine trilogy and I look forward to reading more of his work!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|You can tell that the author is a professor of history because this book is so rich in detail and description. I did not want the story to end. It's so suspenseful and magical and... real. I can't wait for the sequel!!
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Much, much better than I'd expected from some reviews I'd read.     Yes, it is definitely a variation on the theme of Sci Fi that has come before - lots of Alien / Aliens and others, but the production design is so good and the mutant creatures suitably scary that it all works. For once we get a particularly upbeat ending too.     The obligatory giant fan scene is the most cliched scene for me but none of the unoriginal aspects detracted from making this great entertainment.     Cast is solid (Cam Gigandet is perhaps the weakest acting but he looks so damn hot who can complain), soundtrack is impressive and blu-ray quality superb.     If you love entering dark Blade Runner/ Alien-esque environments in outer space with creepy mutants out to eat you - you'll enjoy a dose of Pandorum. Blu-ray slick has a misprint saying the action takes place 500 miles from Earth...make that 500 million!
B003N5VOUO|3.0|I did enjoy some of the performances and if you let yourself wallow in the cheap sentimentality it is pleasurable at points. It's a little too long - an hour too long.
B0033AI4CK|4.0|The picture quality is much better than the DVD version I had but I still felt it should have been better. One of the best Blu-rays I've seen from the late 70s is Being There (as far as picture definition improvement over DVD goes) - this falls well short of that. But still, the quality is way better than All The Presidents Men that has been released on Blu-ray at the same time. If only Warner Brothers could be a little more 'Criterion' in their standards we could really enjoy these films to the level Blu-ray allows.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|The book on which the movie is based is a true original with a strong heroine and some edgy villians who engage in over the top violence. The language is steeped in metaphor and the sound of the Ozarks. The movie looks like it was made by a film school drop out. The lead character is way to soft for the part, the violence is expurgated and we never even see who makes crank and how they do it.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased this knife based on many positive reviews and youtube videos.  It arrived quicker than expected and I am satisfied with the design and workmanship of both the blade and the sheath.  There are numerous reviews that mention the design of the sheath \\"sucks\\", although I have not really used this yet I have to disagree.  I think it will be ok and should do the job fine.  I attached it to my belt and with the strap fastened around the handle the knife does not flop around or hang abnormally while bending or walking.  It is VERY retentive, I had a real hard time removing the knife from the sheath the first few times until finally getting the hang of it.  It does take two hands to remove the knife while attached to a belt, that may be a problem for some.    The knife itself feels very strong and I can imagine the type of beating this thing would be able to withstand.  I did a paper cut test and it does cut paper fine, but I could not get it to shave.  I'm sure I will recontour the edge in the future.  It also would have been nice to have a little jimping on the top portion either where the handle ends or just past it, I do not think a ramp is necessary, just a little jimping.  The handle feels solid as well and I might loctite the bolts down if they ever do work loose in the future.    All in all I think price vs. quality is 100% on the BK2.  I would buy again or recommend to anyone interested in a camp/survival knife.  I will update this review in the next couple weeks to add or take away any comments I made about it, I am going to be taking this camping soon and really work it over.
0451228375|3.0|Pillars had its flaws, but is mostly superb in its story telling and intricate, lyrical prose.  Unlike most fiction, it stayed with me.    This follow-up borrowed several poorly disguised, and less interesting, story-lines and characters from its predecessor.  The original was a drama but this is a soap opera.  You get a lot of crude, gratuitous sex scenes and generally shallow plotting.  It created enough interest for me to finish, but in the end it gave nothing like the same satisfaction as the author's magnum opus.    I won't be reading any of his other books.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This movie had recently been released in the stores. The only thing is that they only came out with the blue ray combo pack first. Well, I dont have blue ray and didnt want to spend 30 bucks on something I wasnt going to use, at least now. I had heard that the DVD movie was going to come out soon, so I figured I would wait. Well, I missed the time frame for the special release price and well I didnt want to pay twenty bucks if I didnt have to. I decided to come on Amazon and found it for a great price! Anyone looking for movies should first look on amazon before shopping in the stores or opting to buy something that you dont need, ie blue ray.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great! I couldn't put the book down! The other two books in the series are equally good.  I would love for more books to be written this way.
0393072231|4.0|so I was on the lookout for sociopaths in the book. Were there any? I'm not going to say, but the Big Short created definite health problems, as the book details, for those who did do the Big Short against conventional wisdom. I've read most of Lewis's books, including Coach, Moneyball, Liar's Poker, and his ability to tell a story did not disapoint. But I need more analysis. I think what he's saying is that the people who discovered that the subprime bonds were a scam, aided in creating  the insurance for these bonds in their desire to bet against the subprime bond industry.

B0043RT8JU|4.0|in a sentence or so: Quentin's got one month until he graduates from high school...which is just enough time for his gorgeous and enigmatic next door neighbor to take him on a night of crazy pranks, disappear, and leave the slightest hint of a trace on how she can be found - should he so desire. he does.<br /><br />Margo Roth Spiegelman has been Quentin's next door neighbor and childhood friend for as long as he can remember. this does not mean, however, they are currently friends. mainly because Margo is the Queen Bee of high school while Q is friends with the band geeks. that's right - he's not a band geek...he is friends with the band geeks and spends his after school time waiting for them by the band door. now, this isn't to say that Q isn't totally fabulous in his own way because he TOTALLY is. but he's awesome in that gangly, awkward, gaming, potty-humor 18 year old boy way. Margo is awesome in a way that's hard to put your finger on, but you just KNOW she's smarter than you, funnier than you, thinking deeper thoughts than you, and is downright more attractive than you.<br /><br />so, imagine Q's surprise when Margo pops up at his window in the middle of the night, for the first time in a good 8 years, for a night of pranks. on a school night! gasp! obviously, Q is hesitant...he does have perfect attendance after all...but you don't just ignore Margo Roth Spiegelman. not because she twists your arm or guilts you or anything, but because she's just the type of person you WANT to be around and WANT to hear and WANT to laugh with and bask in the glory of. so he goes. he pranks and he plots and he breaks and he enters. Q has the time of his life and can't wait to see what the future holds for him and Margo. but the next day, Margo's car is gone. she's left without a trace...or so they think. Q starts to notice some signs that Margo might have left for him and Q can't help but get drawn in to the mystery of finding her. he realizes soon that there are parts of Margo he never knew and for Q to find Margo means to really and truly discover the gorgeous, mysterious, and secretive girl next door.<br /><br />alright, i'll just throw this out there straight up. i am a HUGE John Green fan. i adored Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. this is mainly because John creates a nerdariffic and hilarious cast of characters that i cannot get enough of AND creates a intellectually kickass plot of mystery and self discovery AND infuses humor that is exactly my style. this love definitely continues with Q and his pals, Radar and Ben. there is such authenticity with their interactions and banter that reminds me of my high school days and makes the characters feel absolutely tangible to me.<br /><br />one of the things i loved about Paper Towns was following the clues to discover Margo. it soon becomes a group effort and we learn more about who she is through those who knew her. the core of Q's path to discover Margo is through a highlighted copy of the Walt Whitman collective poems \\"Leaves of Grass\\" which, admittedly, is already quite gorgeous in itself.  the mystery of finding Margo drives the story on, but the true enjoyment for me was the self exploration on behalf of the characters. for instance, Q gets mad at Ben because he isn't putting the same value on finding Margo as he is (mainly because he's hungover at that time) and Radar comes out with some seriously insightful mediating that blew my adult mind away.  he concludes his argument with \\"Just saying: stop thinking Ben should be you, and he needs to stop thinking you should be him, and y'all just chill the hell out.\\" (155) genius.<br /><br />if you're the kind of person who likes smart, witty, silly, hilarious, relateable, thought provoking, intentional, intellectual and sophisticated reads from an adorably nerdy-yet-cool teen boy perspective - then this is the book for you. in related news, John Green is the author for you.<br /><br />fave quote: \\"I couldn't help but think about school and everything else ending. I liked standing just outside the couches and watching them - it was a kind of sad I didn't mind, and so I just listened, letting all the happiness and the sadness of this ending swirl around in me, each sharpening the other. For the longest time, it felt kind of like my chest was cracking one, but not precisely in an unpleasant way.\\" (172)<br /><br />fix er up: the prom drama wasn't my fave, but it is their senior year and is totally something teen readers can relate to, so it makes sense.ked standing just outside the couches and watching them - it was a kind of sad I didn't mind, and so I just listened, letting all the happiness and the sadness of this ending swirl around in me, each sharpening the other.

0670022411|1.0|So I enjoyed the book but as I was getting closer to the end(some 500 plus pages)it was becoming very clear the author was writing a partial novel.  Sometimes I will buy a book that is a \\"part one\\", but I would like to be forwarned and make up my mind myself. Come on, no answers and no ending after almost 600 pages.  No fun!
B000OONQ9O|5.0|I like a lot of Walter Hill's movies and this is a favorite. I was very happy to replace my DVD with an improved Blu-ray copy.<br /><br />For those who complain that this new version emphases the cartoon nature of the movie, well Doh! If you want a realer deal on street gangs, read the book. The James Remar character - a favorite character actor of mine - comes closest. For example, Mercy asks the Warriors if they are planning to pull a train on her. In the movie, it's like \\"Huh?\\" In the book, it's \\"All aboard!\\"<br /><br />But then, who wants to see true to life violence. I will take the stylized cinema variety any day.<br /><br />Now, if only I can get a good Blu-ray version of \\"Streets of Fire\\".
B004KAB43I|5.0|I have already seen the movie, and this book is just too funny. I read a lot of chick lit and this is one of the best.
030745455X|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than the first, perhaps because all of the old characters were back, namely Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist so we were spared having to suffer through in-depth character analysis that many good authors work in throughout the story rather than provide us with several chapters of \\"background\\" right off the bat. Don't get me wrong, the author is a wonderful writer, but he can get bogged down in boring details from time to time.<br /><br />Two points of note....I listened to this book on audiotape so if you are reading this book you may skim through a lot of it, and you must read the third book in order to get any kind of closure as there really is no ending and it wouldn't be out of line for the last chapter to include the words \\"to be continued\\".<br /><br />The one thing I like about Stieg Larsson's plots is that he appears to want to always have his characters come out on top so even if their situation is for all intents and purposes, hopeless, they always prevail in the end.  Some people may not like this but there is only so much angst I can suffer through and with his books, you know there will be a payoff in the end.<br /><br />Overall, this book is better than the first, more interesting and exciting.  I know more now about Sweden then I could ever imagine wanting too (kidding)and the street names, cities and miscellaneous locations are almost becoming familiar.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is worth the read, but you will have to read the third book to get the payoff.
B000059MEK|5.0|Great album but feels a little funkier than the rest.  I think tracks 1,2,4,9,14 are pretty much a classic at this point.  I would highly recommend checking out their other albums.  Here are some of their best albums in my opinion:  [...]
0307454541|4.0|Let me prefix this review by saying that I listened to this book while driving in my car.  I feel it important to mention that, because I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if I hadn't.<br /><br />The book is very slow paced offers in-depth and long winded character analysis and quite frankly had a lot of background information that I would have skimmed thru if I had been reading it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the characters were unique and fleshed out, the story was believable and the conclusion was satisfying.<br /><br />I think ultimately everything was tied up in a neat little bundle a little too conveniently and easily, but the ride was interesting enough to make it worth the read.
030726999X|5.0|I must admit I came late to this trilogy. I first saw the 'Tattoo' movie on my laptop through Netflix, and was hooked. I read \\"Fire' in paperback and was left wanting. So, it was on to 'Hornet's Nest', which was the best. My one criticism, for all three, is the excessive details and names of streets and highways and buildings, neighborhoods and towns in Sweden that I cannot relate to at all, and which caused me unnecessarily to pause in reading the action. Of course,the late author was not writing for me and the translator was presumably being true to the original(s).<br />Great book, priced right, delivered in 3 days - who could ask for more?
0316098337|5.0|This is a book that you can't put down until you know how it all turns out.   Great Book !
B001J4E1D8|5.0|Amazing work. The miniseries stays very close to the book and the actors really bring this Victorian classic to life. I can't believe I waited this long to watch it. Breathtaking. Beautiful. Watch it. (You'll even not mind the BBC's usual over-use of fog for drama scenes.)
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Conflicted about this one. A slow build up and second half bog down the book. The middle is so compelling however that I fully reccomend it soley for the brilliance of that one section.
0743277708|5.0|I think Watership Down is an informative and imaginative book about how rabbits live in society.  Even though the book is fictional, it takes you into the lives and journeys of a group of rabbits formed to leave their home.  With all the trials and tribulations the rabbits go through, they finally find a place to call their own home.  Symbolism is embedded in this novel through different species of animals working together for one common goal.  This novel can be enjoyed by all.  I first read this book in 8th grade and I just finished reading it to my own students.  I recommend reading this classic book to all lovers of suspense, mystery, and adventure.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch. You just never know what will happen next. The comedic talents of the actors is very well played out. Red is a movie you can watch over and over again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout was one of the most intense, calorie burning, butt kicking workouts I've done since high school aerobics class! Totally worth the buy, you won't regret it!
B000ZLZQ4E|1.0|I question the historical accuracy of this film. Caligula was a violent and cruel man. While this movie captures his depravity if it was meant to be entertaining it missed the mark.
B003UESJEM|5.0|This is a film that oozes with realism and timeliness. The GTX corporation, headed by an overpaid, callous CEO (Craig T. Nelson)--who cares only about the stockholders, a new corporate headquarters, and his salary and stock options--cuts divisions and lays off thousands of workers--some of whom have been with him and the firm for decades. It's not that they aren't hardworking and dedicated, it's just \\"business.\\"<br /><br />One of the men who is laid off is in his thirties (Ben Affleck); the other is twenty years older (Chris Cooper). Another (Tommy Lee Jones) roomed in college with the CEO and helped him build the company from the ground up, concentrating on shipbuilding in the Boston area. All three men live lavishly, with fancy houses, furnishings, and cars.<br /><br />Affleck is great as the proud, bitter, and then humbled white-collar executive, who has to sell his million-dollar home (in the depressed housing market) and Porsche, and then move in with his parents and work for his brother-in-law (played nicely by Kevin Costner) constructing someone else's mega-house. Cooper is also good--downtrodden and desperate, forced to dye his hair, and grovel at job interviews and with associates. And Jones is wonderful--a man with a conscience in the business world, who cares about the people who work at GTX. He also starts to reevaluate his life, both professionally and personally, in middle age.<br /><br />The film--written and directed by John Wells--hits home. Most of us know people like the ones we see in The Company Men. They can be vain, pushy, and full of themselves; but when things don't go their way, they can be depressed and helpless. Yes, people need to make a living, but they also need to think about what's really important--family, friends, and self-fulfillment. This is a film that makes you think about these things.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have had this little Pocket Pal with me for a while now and am loving it. It works great and is easy to carry. It is a great value.
0316098337|5.0|An exciting book right from the opening statement, told from a 5 year olds perspective.  Jack and Ma live in Room. Room is the only experience in life that Jack knows. Everything within Room in Jack's perspective is real; everything else is TV or outside Room, which he refers to as Outer Space.  Nothing except Ma, Jack, Room and the items within Room exist to Jack. He sleeps in Wardrobe, his gym is Track around Table to Wardrobe and back. Ma provides Jack with the security and routine that every child needs BUT within a10x10 Room, every minute of every day. After Jack's 5th birthday life as he knows it will take a turn. Jack will have a big responsibility to help not only him and his mother escape but learn how to survive in the real world and not the fantasy one she shelter Jack from in Room.<br /><br />An excellent book from the first to the last page.
0670022411|1.0|This was a sum of so many mainstream occult movies/books spanning over 15 years rolled into a weak 600 page blathering of nothing.  I had some glimmer of hope when I read the free preview that this might be interesting, however it chose to prove me most wrong.  This is living proof that any story that has a two or more occult themes entwined in its pages can be published regardless if there is no definitive plot, no action, no romance, excessive mundane details or bland and static characters.  In this book Harry Potter is a girl, who like Sandra Bullock in practical magic doesn't want to use magic because \\"it killed her parents\\", who like hermoine likes to read ancient things to try and pretend she's doing science, bumps into and falls instantly in love with a very old and very old fashion hybrid of a wealthy Edward and wolfy Jacob (blood sucker with pack like mentality and wolf like diet, with french inclination to drink the vineyards dry).  She discovers she has the ability to be \\"godlike and more powerful than any witch ever\\" (no doubt being a fictional vicarious life of a closeted witch who teaches history, writes bad romance novels and secretly wishes she was special).  Because of this the evil creature tribunal is dead set on destroying there cross breeding relationship because they might god forbid have children!  Blah, blah, blah.    This is not a romance novel.  Even twilight had a sexual/sensual moments.  The vampire in this book marries her in two weeks, but doesn't intend to consummate the marriage until she reaches menopause, because after 1500 years he's still not ready for children.  I never felt any spark of passion between them and her so called love for him felt more like a teenage crush with a older guy that parents warn their daughters about, but they never listen. It's not even historical fiction.  Making references to famous historical names and the \\"origin of species\\" does not a scientific approach to life and the occult make.  This book is like a Randy Newman song.  It's a play by play of the most mundane details of life.  She eats, sleeps, eats, sleeps...searches for tea, eats, sleeps.    Then the book ends and you realize that after 600 pages there is no conclusion.  This book belonged on the shelves of bad new age fiction.  I may not get my life back...but at least I'll get my 20 bucks back.
B000KIPT30|4.0|The amp is great - sounds are better, the volume controls are well made and turn smoothly.  The only problem is the connectors - for a small amp like this I'd think 3.5mm is much more common than the larger 1/4\\" that it has on the box.      Most headphones outside of studios are 3.5mm now, and a studio isn't going to be using something this small.  It would have been much nicer to have 3.5mm on the box, and have to buy the 3.5-1/4\\" convertors instead.  It just creates another connection which can degrade audio quality.
0316098337|4.0|Telling this story from the boy's perspective is what makes this a great book. His innocence shows through, and his mood can change in a heartbeat. How his perceptions change as the book goes on is a joy to watch, even while the reader is gripped with the horror of it all.     The only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars is that there are a couple of plot devices that seem hollow, but they don't mar the overall effect. Buy this, read it, tell your friends, recommend it to your book group. It's that good.
B000OONTFU|5.0|I saw this HD-DVD box set on sale for $23 and I thought it was a good deal for two good discs.  You get The \\"Matrix\\" which is a fantastic movie and the \\"Animatrix\\" which is a collection of animations not in HD with storylines branching from the movies.  To enjoy \\"Reloaded\\" or \\"Revolutions\\", put the disc in the player, turn down the stereo, turn off the TV, go out and eat a nice dinner then come back when you're finished.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|For director Darren Aronofsky, the pipe dream of Pi, and the promise of [[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]]has become the reality of Black Swan.<br /><br />For actress Natalie Portman, Black Swan has offered the best role and she has delivered the best performance of her career.  She lost 20 pounds to play the role.<br /><br />Nina Sayers operates in the highly competitive and perfectionistic world of ballet.  She is perfectionistic and insecure.  'I just want to be perfect.' When the prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder is forced to retire, because she is considered too old though she is still young, numerous dancers vie for her position, to play the lead role in the Black Swan. In the story the white swan representing the light wants the prince, and the black swan representing the dark side swoops in and seduces the prince.<br /><br />The dancer has to dance both roles. In the privacy of the bathroom and away from public eyes her insecurities get the better of her. So begins the descent into madness.  In order to play both roles she has to tap her own dark side, which she has repressed all her life.  The question becomes will she be able to play the role and recover, and triumph, or will she so overidentify with the role that she meets a similar fate as the white swan.  The director of the ballet grabs her.  He has seduced the prima ballerinas before, and says 'I want there to be no boundaries between us.' Almost as soon as the production starts, the black swan manifests in the form of Mila Kunis, who coincidentally has black wings tattooed on her back.<br /><br />At home the controlling mother played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey has no sense of boundaries, and intrudes in her private domain of the bathroom, and the bedroom.<br /><br />Almost as soon as the production starts, the black swan manifests in the form of Mila Kunis, who coincidentally has black wings tattooed on her back, and onto whom she projects her insecurities. Will she seduce the dark prince, the director.<br /><br />What I liked particularly about this movie is the seamlessness of the directors vision.  Sometimes its dissociated as she is in the picture and we are following her.  When this happens we are in reality.  The it moves to the subjective and we are seeing what she sees, and we are having having some of the same difficulties she has determining what is real and what is projection, and we find it difficult sometimes to tell the difference.  Much has been made of the raunchy love scene with Mila Kunis, and it was good.<br /><br />In fact, if you are like me you may need to watch it a second time to figure this out better.<br /><br />Typically, the Academy award goes for two types of roles:<br /><br />1. The psychopath eg no Country for Old men, and There Will be blood<br /><br />2.  The person with a social or personal disability, having to deal with great adversity, overcoming great odds, mental illness addiction etc. eg Jeffrey Rush in Shine  Russell Crowe in a Beautiful Mind, Jeff Bridges as an alcoholic in Crazy Heart.<br /><br />If this year follows the usual pattern, Natalie Portman will win as the mentally ill ballerina, Colin Firth as the Stammering king in The Kings Speech, and Chrisian bale as the crackhead boxing coach in The Fighter.  While I favor Aronofsky for Best Picture and Best Director, it's by no means as clear cut as the the acting categories, as the Fighter, True Grit and Kings Speech are very evenly matched for quality.<br /><br />There are parallels between Black Swan and other movies where art imitates life.  If you wish to explore other great movies, I recommend the [[ASIN:B004CGUC10 The Double Life of Veronique (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]] also recommended by Roger Ebert, and [[ASIN:B003ICZW8C The Red Shoes (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]] most of all which features a ballerina with a controlling svengali like director.<br /><br />I happen to be a big fan of Natalie Portman although I have not really followed her career till the last two years.  If you wish to explore further I highly recommend [[ASIN:0767802519 The Professional]](aka the Cleaner), her very first role where in the stylish Luc Besson movie.  There are several different versions. An outstanding movie, and the [[ASIN:B0012QE4Q2 The Other Boleyn Girl]] where she stars with Scarlett Johansson.

B004GBIE3Y|5.0|i loved this movie im only a teenager and its a little more extreme than my problems, but it made me realize alotta things about myself, and how little my problems matter when compared to my friends, family, and the people i care about. This movie had some great actors, especially the teenager girl who i thought was really cute. The story line is great. it left me feeling warm and fuzzy because it was a cute movie.
B004J5366M|5.0|From time to time a music album pops up every now and then and reminds you why you love music. This is that album. The melodies on this album are mesmerizing and intoxicating, each track entrancing you deeper and deeper. It is truly refreshing to hear music with such purpose and conviction. The recording is a little lo-fi but now that I have listened to this over and over I wouldn't have it any other way. Though stylistically different, I can relate this artist closely to Nick Drake in the fact that his vocal range, tone and musical direction is completely his own and imitation is near impossible. I will enjoy hearing more of Mr McMorrows work in the future.
B000ID1J5E|3.0|This was my first video download from amazon and the video quality was horrible. Such a shame for a film with such awesome scenery. I'll give amazon video on demand one more try but if the quality isn't better, I'll just be content that I had gotten a free code for it.
B004EPYZOO|3.0|While one might think that B-grade grindhouse films may be all but extinct in this modern day and age, \\"Drive Angry\\"  is a movie that unashamedly continues the tradition of parading gunfire, sex, explosions, fast cars, and satanic cults, and manages to do so in a way that makes it very entertaining for those who go in expecting such a spectacle.    \\"Drive Angry\\" follows John Milton, a man who is going after a satanic cult, in order to rescue his granddaughter from their foul clutches, and prevent Hell from being unleashed on earth.  But it won't be easy, for despite all the firepower at his command, and the fast cars he drives, John is being followed by something evil...and not of this earth, that will stop at nothing to catch up with him.    \\"Drive Angry\\" is a film content to relish it's violent, over the top heritage with lots of action and nudity (complete with naked, satanic hookers with machine guns).  While it won't win any awards, the film is a fun romp for B movie fans, especially with regards to Nicholas Cage and William Fichtner.  While Cage doesn't deviate too much from his usual subdued happy go lucky persona, he is fun to watch (especially when he seems to be doing his best, \\"Terminator\\" impression).  Alongside him, Fichtner is an absolute delight as the supernatural accountant, clearly having a blast every minute he's on screen, and bringing a wonderful, demonic delight to his part, perhaps making him the most enjoyable part of the film.    Overall, \\"Drive Angry\\" is much like 2007's, \\"Grindhouse\\" in that it will very likely cater to a very specific group of cinema fans, and will not appeal to many others.  But those who enjoy 70's style exploitation will find a lot to like here.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I don't know what people are complaining about.  Watching  Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy in hand to hand combat is pretty good stuff.  And the ending is unexpected and moving.
B000FA57N0|5.0|I was unaware of Firefly (the TV series) or Serenity (the movie)until a few weeks ago. After seeing the unbelievable Amazon ratings (thousands of votes with an almost 5 star rating) I ordered both. I'm glad I did, both movie and TV series are compellingly original and outstanding entertainment. With all the mediocre fare on TV it amazes me this series was cancelled.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was good, but it could have been better.                  *SPOILERS AHEAD*    Starting with the compliments, Collis did a pretty good job developing her characters.  Katniss, not so much.  I liked the war part, but alot of it was spent on describing how it felt.  I mean, i like authors doing that, but I felt that his was a bit of an overkill.    Now on with the flaws.  One of the main problems, as alot of other people said, was Katniss wasn`t being independant.  At first a little when she said she did not want to be the mockinjay, but then she saw how bad Panem needed her and...  She took the job.  But i think she did it more for Peeta snd the other victors being held captive by the capitol then herself.  That was a major problem.    Another problem was that I like to know who`s on what side.  Though I guess that`s to keep the suspense going I didn`t like it.  Peeta really summed it up,&#34;Can you really trust those people Katniss?&#34;  I know I couldn`t.  At least not Coin.  Which brings me to another matter.  I`m glad Katniss shot Coin, since she wanted another hunger games she would be as bad as Snow.  But since she shot Coin it`s like Snow made her do it.  But I`m getting ahead of myself.  Here`s the biggie.  The big war.  Why did Prim, Finnik, and Boggs die? I think Collins spent to moc time describing the war, not what was really going on.  And why did 13 have to bomb the children?  Couldn`t they just take them to 13 and raisethem from there how to act?  Not just kill them in cold blood?  And why on Earth would anyone send Prim to the capitol?  I didn`t think the war was plotted perfectly, and sent to much time at the end, when Katniss is burning on her injeries.  and then there isthe matter of Peeta being hijacked.  Since I`m team Peeta I sure didn`t like that part.  I didn`t like that he tried to kill Katniss, but I commend Collins for actually being able to think like that.  I like the idea of Katniss killing Coin, as i said before,  how she just turned on Coin like that.  But what surprised me is that Katniss wanted to have a hunger games for the capitol children.  It was like she was a capitol person.  Also, thinking just like one.  Most people,like me, thought Katniss would of said no because she knows what horror the kids will be facing.  I was surprised she along with Haymich said yes.  But oneof the things I love is at the end when Peeta says&#34; You love me?&#34;  And then Katniss says&#34; Real.&#34;  Bt what confused me is in the very end.  When Katniss and Peeta and their kids are living back in district 12.  I mean, I thought since Katniss and Peeta wuld be the rlers of Panem, ut instead thy chose the normal and simple life back at 12.      The book was a little confusing, and had many flaws, but i thinj it was kind of th right ending for the series.  Real, or not Real?
B004MMEIK0|4.0|Was looking through the free ebooks and found this book. The title is deceiving though and really has nothing to do with the story. This is the first book I've read from this author and will definitely be checking out more of her books. When I read this I was thinking it would be just another Vampire story, I actually found myself laughing out load. This series is somewhat unique take on the life of a vampire, of course, similar message in that the human rescues the vampires soul. Really enjoyed the book and will read more.
B0049PNOS2|4.0|I love Eros, he is the most talented singer I have ever heard... I would have loved the new DVD, had I been able to play it on any of my DVD players (have 3) in my home.  I was able to get it to play on my computer, which, I was able to connect to my TV, to see it on a larger screen, and get the surround sound.. Otherwise I would have rated it as 5 stars. The music and performance delivers!!! I felt like I was seeing him live once again.
0634089358|5.0|Ed Friedland at his very best: well built up, clear classical/TAB notation, great choice of tunes, great audio.  Well, except that I don't really like that stereo separation format: I prefer to have the \\"minus one versions\\" on a separate track.  So I made my own \\"minus one\\" CD, using Audacity, and put the bassless channel on both channels.  The overall quality of this book is so high, that this little detail couldn't possibly take off any of the five stars!  Even when you're through the book, it's a keeper because of the fine playing (with Ed, a blues guitar student in his earlier days, on guitar, and a buddy of his on drums) on the play-along tracks: you'll be playing along with the songs over and over, just for fun!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I truly loved this book.  It was a welcome relief from the erotica type books where if you remove the erotica you have 100 pages of actual story line.   The characters are very nicely defined and believable.  This was a story that pulled you in and let you leave the real world for however long you could ..real life has a horrible way of interfering when reading a good book...  I hated to see it end.      I detest the long wait between books but I think this one will be worth it.  It will be interesting to travel back in time with Matthew and Diana and see how things evolve.
0439023513|4.0|While I agree with a lot of other reviews that Mockingjay needed a whole lot of editing...I could not tear myself away from the powerful message that Mockingjay wrapped up. Collins did decide to take on a whole other message from the first two books. While the first two books take a deep look into where reality tv and materialism could take our society, the third book portrays the deeply cliche message: War is horrible. It makes you wonder to what degree these themes are related. America gets its news/messages mainly through television. To what extent are our broadcasters leading us down this same path as Mockinjay shows? Do we know what is real and what isn't? Do we know what stories are shown and which ones aren't due to political pressure? Do we know who the bad guys are? This book posed all of these questions for me...and while abstract, I think they are deeply relevant. Will tv one day make us oblivious to oppressive rulers and inhumane deeds?     Katniss was a victim of both extremes- reality television and war. The whole time she was just fighting for her and her loved ones to be themselves. She was not herself in the arena, she was not herself in the battlefields. The only time she was truly free was when she was with Gale in the woods. What is amazing about Katniss is that through all of this she kept her humanity...     ****Spoiler alert>*****              Along with Peeta. That is why I was not mad about the epilogue. Meanwhile, Gale gave in to the original capitol...a good example of this is that he went to work for a television company. This book was about holding on to what is real and how, even today, that is hard to do.

B003H9MSPG|5.0|The gun arrived quickly and well packed and worked very well. Though it may fire only a few meters it looks good with my laser pointer and rifle scope. Very fun gun to modify and looks very impressive.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|This CD is RAD, but could have done with a bit of mixing. It's essentually all the tracks taken exactly as they are frm the movie. Still good though.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This is the first novel I read by the author based on the great Kindle price, reviews and my love for thrillers.  You will not be disappointed with this one.  The story starts with a domestic dispute in a tony neighborhood...Bobby Dodge, police sniper to the rescue.  After taking out the crazed pistol waving husband, things are clearly not what they seemed to be.  No one is who they seem to be, and no one is to be trusted.  Reminds me of those old Cold War spy stories.  Was Bobby set up?  Was his ex-girlfriend involved in setting him up?  Is Catherine, the abused wife, really a sociopathic mother?  There are red herrings, there are \\" I should have seen it coming...\\"  A true cerebral adventure, but that said, I could not say I found little empathy for the characters. Overall, exciting study in psychopathology, but do not look for that heart-warming ending.
B002RKSZWG|3.0|If (like me) you value Austen primarily for her wit, you may pass on Persuasion.      Persuasion is a bit tedious. It's all mincing and moralizing, with none of the wit and good humor that make Pride and Prejudice worthwhile.  Persuasion's protagonist, the wilting Anne Elliot, is a doormat for her self-involved relations, whom she not only tolerates but also excuses. Anne's blushing weakness may add to the melodrama (maybe the romance), but it also sucks all the satire out of the narrative.  As a result, the reader is deprived of a richly deserved laugh at the pompous antagonists' expense.  And without a good laugh, the story is hardly worth the trouble.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love, love, loved this movie! Christina Aguilera is amazing! So skilled at both dancing and singing you can hardly believe it. And, did I mention, gorgeous? Cher is marvelous, as usual. Her two songs leave you wanting more, if you're a fan, as I am. The choreography is brilliant. Can't understand why more wasn't made of this delightful movie at the Oscars. Just loved every minute of it. Pure entertainment. Can hardly wait to own it.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Great show, great price (the best), and quick delivery! I loved this show so I bought all the seasons! It came quick and in great condition, no problems with skipping. It even had the little books to tell you what the strange talk meant, I loved it! Some of the things they say go right over my head.
0896898288|5.0|This book has beautiful quilt blocks complete with a CD that has the templates that you can print.  I loved the stories as well, The wives of the farmers describe their lives as complete, fulfilling and with purpose quite contradictory to the apparent impression of the city women, they also tell of their hopes and dreams for their children.  Another beautiful book.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Great buy! I loved this show so much and bought all the seasons! They come new or used but I never had a problem with them being scratch! All played great and I am so happy I bought them. I did some looking around and this was the best deal.
B004E547D8|5.0|My husband and I have watched the movie a second time, and still see things that we missed during our first viewing.  Thoroughly entertaining with a great deal of humor.  Malkovich is a scream!! Yeah for the ol' guys!
0307454541|5.0|Good book, much better than the movie. So much more, like all books, than the movie could ever do. Great cover, pretty good quality paper, a fantastic read. It is about two different people and how their lives come together. One is an older guy leaving home because of a mess with his business and the other is a girl that has been through hell growing up with no father and a mom that wasn't around. She goes from being really hard to having a heart for the guy. Good book but very detailed in some places. I didn't see it coming but she is attached and abused and it tells all about it.
B0043EV774|3.0|The movie is dark (as is typical of Tim Burton Films). I do not recommend this for small children (under age 8 to 10), especially in 3D. It will be too intense for them.<br /><br />The 3D is very good. The disk was a problem. It kept shutting down showing and the link to the glasses. I even changed out the glasses thinking the glasses were not charged. Eventually the movie stopped playing completely (only about 1/4 the way through).<br /><br />The 3D TV is brand new. The player is brand new. The 3D glasses are brand new. All bought through Amazon. It is clearly this movie. I am exchanging it in hopes it is only this particular pressing of the disk that is defective. If the replacement does the same thing I'll request a refund then.
B000063DI9|5.0|i'm not a fan of bruce dickinson's vocals, i'm rather into more 'evil', 'epic' or superhuman sounding vocals like rob halford, dio, tony martin, warrel dane or eric adams, or acquired tastes like jon oliva or hansi kursch. bruce dickinson never struck me as sthg out of the ordinary or distinctively 'metallic'.<br /><br />until i heard this album.<br /><br />btw my top  5 maiden albums are: 1-7th son of a 7th son, 2-somewhere in time, 3-powerslave, 4-piece of mind, 5-killers.<br /><br />while i never questioned maiden's awesome musicianship, their atmosphere as a metal band seemed (again, in my opinion) to be lacking something that would truely achieve the epicness proper to metal music. the melodies were always hooking but never threatening enough and the vocals had a comical vibe especially on high notes (think the opening scream of 'be quick or be dead!). well on '7th son...' Iron Maiden have succeeded in crafting their greatest collection of bad a$$ evil riffs, with Dickinson sticking to mostly mid-range vocals, snarling where needed and with the tone that fits him best, to awesome effect.<br /><br />the malevolence doesnt let go from the opener 'moonchild' to 'only the good die young',<br />you are treated to music that feels deliciously Lovecraftian from start to finish (except maybe on 'can I play with madness' with its happier mood). 'happy' sounding chords and melodies kill the metal effect and degrade a metal song to 'hard rock' status in my book and the song 'can i play with madness' is the album's only glitch in my opinion, otherwise, the mood is unmatched by any other maiden album to this day, the guitar duels as tasty as they come, the drumming and keys impressive, the bass monumental but THIS TIME, the vocals also measure up to maiden's instrumental arsenal because they are the reason behind the album's 'metalness'!<br />the vocals' bite would be sadly lost on later albums, which is a shame.<br /><br />dickinson's stand out performances here, are the opener, the title track and the closing track although it's stellar all throughout.<br /><br />i believe this is maiden's musical and vocal peak, probably the only 'dark' album by this band and an excellent introduction to iron maiden along with any or all 4 albums i mentioned earlier.lthough it's stellar all throughout.    i believe this is maiden's musical and vocal peak, probably the only 'dark' album by this band and an excellent introduction to iron maiden along with any or all 4 albums i mentioned earlier.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This movie caught me unaware - it wasn't a movie - it was so REAL.  It was a stark docudrama of epic proportions. At times the characters were so real and nauseating, it was hard to watch.  In the end it was about a person rising above his elements of environment and his family to be his best.  The cast was incredible and as soon as you are swept away by their realism - it is an incredible journey. Christian Bale was exquisite and his talent at transforming himself into someone else's persona so incredible that one can forgive almost all the hipe of his ignorant, violent behavior. Mark Walberg is sold short.  His acting was a suitable juxtaposition for Bale. See it.  It will take a few moments to understand that this is more than a movie... it takes you away - to another realistic place and as soon as you adjust - it will take your breath away!
B004GHYCKW|5.0|I have followed PJ's career since her mid 90's rise to stardom with albums like Rid of Me and Is this Desire? I became a fan of her very particular style and daring musical choices at the height of the \\"alternative rock\\" craze. Through the years I have been inspired, intrigued and flat out emotionally stricken by her material but this album and her predecessor have made me realize what a beautiful artist she really is. White Chalk went down -at least with the critics- as being one of her less understood, difficult and self-absorbed effort to date. I actually found it to be quite the eye-opener and was impressed by her newfound musicality and overall improved songwriting skills in developing a cohesive, moving and personal rumination on death and the afterlife. The themes were stark and barren but the effect was surprisingly beguiling. The album was short yet it \\"read\\" like a really good novel or collection of horror stories. I was hooked and at the same time perplexed by the lukewarm critical reception and the flack she got for no longer being an overtly sexualized cock-rocker-mocker like on her early works. I found the album to be utterly brilliant and wondered what it would take for the world to realize the greatness and relevance of her as an artist on these seemingly decadent historical times. Either way, the true PJ fan knows she is not a one trick pony and that game-changing is her thing.    The triumph of Let England Shake lies in the contrast of equally dark themes -if not actually darker than White Chalk- set against a brighter palette of musical arrangements and a whimsy rarely seen in her previous works. She is widely seen as a serious artist, I believe to a fault. The irony is not lost here and those who have a relatively open ear will quickly realize the grandness of the concept and the beauty of the songs is the lightness in which she chose to tell these stories of war, death and a world lost in the trenches. Almost twenty years after making her startling debut she has now become the voice of a contradictory new generation: the hopeful pessimist in a seemingly dying world. This is the best transformation I have seen in a 90s artist yet. Brilliant!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Twilight saga for adults. This book leaves you looking for more answers by the end. Cant wait for the sequel :)
B003UESJFG|3.0|Bought movie because I expected it to be the same as it was in the theater with the 3D scenes.  It is not.  Amazon's description is misleading.  I invited my grandkids over to watch a 3D movie..very disappointing .
1594202842|5.0|I decided to read this book because of all the uproar.  i wanted to see for myself what Ms. Chua was trying to communicate.    What i found was a very honest look into what it was/is like to try and raise children the \\"Chinese\\" way.  Contrary to what many people have said about the book and her, she is not at all certain by books end and I think she gave both her daughters an authentic voice.    Her writing is very well done and it was a pleasure to read even if at times I was shaking my head at what she was doing to her daughters.    Intellectually the only thing that truly bothers me with her writing is that she so divides the world into Chinese parenting and Western parenting as though there is no nuance no variation...it is either one or the other and she holds such strong stereotypes of \\"Western\\" parenting that it does not seem as if she can see beyond that.  This is disappointing in one so well educated.  The other thing that really makes no sense to me is her insistence that Chinese parents accept nothing but winning/being the best.  Yet there can be only one \\"best\\", only one winner and there would seem to be an awful lot of Chinese children so what the heck to the vast majority of the Chinese children do in Ms Chua's version of the world?    A great read and I think Ms Chua learned as much as her daughters did on their journey.  There is no reason to vilify this woman...read the book before you judge her.
B002ZG99TK|1.0|This is another shaky camera movie to make you barf!!!  Couldn't watch it as it made me motion sick.
0575079754|3.0|This was a different from what I normaly read and that is more Tolkien like books. The Author writes about young men who are brought up to be thievs and con men in an world where magic exsits but not in an magic world. Not a book about big strong heroes, and magicians but more about a Dikcens kind of fantasy world. I found it a bit on the hard side to read for some reason or another. I fealt that I had to push my self through the book, even that I was a interesting book to read.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|I didn't believe other people's reviews.  It was awful, I want my money back, and I want the time back that I spent listening to that crappy CD.  Why can't I change the stars back to zero?  or negative?
B0038WCC62|4.0|I was ambiguous in my feelings about this release when I first heard about it. It took a couple of listens for it to truly sink in.  I like many other wish for something more palpable from the King of Sumptuous, Cerebral, White-Man Ideal Reality, Sensuality and Bump.  But this is a bit different. It serves all of us right for not divining it's aspect and intention before listening...  Honestly and in trepidation, all I could think at first listen was, \\"Thank god it's not a Christmas album!\\"      In pleasured review...  He took an excerpt from many of ours favorite David Bowie song and turned it into something to be revered. He took a Paul Simon song and made it sound as if it was written with his intentions and by him.  He took a song by the Magnetic Fields and made it a song suitable for a thousand weddings.  What more could we ask of this shaman of communication, inter-connection, absurd sensuality and love?      I have no compunctions in saying he's always been a touch ham-handed, a bit belabored--the thud in his bump too much thought in his process. Is it me or is this the 'unsung' imperfect thing that attracts so many of us--elaborations on emotion thought and human relation?         Only 3/4th of the album work for me, but what does work is something very special--dare I say even touching.  The resulting album is almost as personal and honest as his most accessible album \\"Us.\\"      It is amazing that a man in his 60's, with conviction and pride in his art, yet again can change up his method (he is still one of the most methodical musicians today) and inspire the plane innocence and tenuous joy of what it is to aspire to reach out to another.     In in may ways it is least contrived/mired in process offering from Mr. Gabriel.  The orchestration, reminiscent of Phillip Glass and other minimalist composers, is in no way off-putting.      The live concert was the finest concert I have ever seen.  A great cast of performers and a crowd who was there to see a fine artist at his best. My wife and I were overjoyed to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary in part with this event.     Give this album a listen.  You will not be disappointed.
044654759X|5.0|I'll give this one 4.5 stars. It contains a few slow parts, which Sparks has a tendency to fall prey to in his writing; however, the book overall has more action and drama than you might expect from a Sparks novel. I was impressed by Safe Haven!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|All actors in this film are remarkable. The back and forth between couples is well layered, and although I don't care for Julia Roberts in most films, I really like her work here. She is believable. Natalie Portman is Oscar worthy.  Clive Owen and Jude Law are sexy, multidimensional and unpredictable. As is the story. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that its just a little toooo graphic in sexual descriptive language... interestingly, no actual sex is shown.
1400097029|1.0|Banville is a master of the English language.  Each page of \\"The Sea\\" contains magnificent passages,  poetic in their cadence and brilliant in their insights.  Banville displayed superb skills in shifting the narrator's thoughts to different points in time.      That alone makes the book a must read. It is a shame that Banville felt compelled to wrap up the story line with an explanation for everything.  I didn't think the sudden explanation fit with the information the narrator had previously provided the reader. It somehow diminished the satisfaction of sitting at the foot of the narrator. This was the only reason I didn't give \\"The Sea\\" five stars.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|As Ian Gillan and Roger Glover departed, in came David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. The authentic progressive rock sound that we all know and love has been relatively replaced with a more funk-style, with a few blues elements here and there. It's a different sound than what you would here in Machine Head and In Rock. Still, it's pretty nice to hear something different from Deep Purple. The songs aren't first-rate compared to \\"Speed King\\" or \\"Maybe I'm a Leo,\\" but they are still incredibly enjoyable to listen to. \\"Mistreated\\" remains my personal favorite on the album, while \\"You Fool No One\\" is fun with its drums and cowbell (you \\"gotta have more cowbell!\\"). \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\" and \\"Sail Away\\" are pretty weak, otherwise the other songs are great. The 2004 remixes (tracks 9 through 13) aren't necessarily filler since they're pretty decent.<br /><br />By the way, just because the sound is new doesn't mean that it's completely terrible. Bands always change their music, and this one doesn't fail even if Gillan and Glover left at the time.<br /><br />Grade: 8.1/10<br /><br />Also from Deep Purple<br />In Rock (10/10) [[ASIN:B000005RQT In Rock: 25th Anniversary (UK)]]<br />Fireball (9.1/10) [[ASIN:B001CBW13A Fireball]]<br />Machine Head (10/10) [[ASIN:B000002KHB Machine Head]]<br />Who Do We Think We Are (9.4/10) [[ASIN:B00006BTAN Who Do We Think We Are]]

0156421178|5.0|I came late to George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia.This book told me more about the tragedy of the civil war than anything I have read in past years. It is no wonder that Franco won the war. I visited Spain several years ago. Nobody I talked to wanted to discuss that war. Now I can understand why. Bill Miller
0811866351|5.0|I won't repeat the positive things that other people have mentioned, and only add that I particularly enjoyed the storyboards, color scripts, and color keys. There are definitely other Art of titles that I enjoy more, but if you are a collector of the Art of books then there is no question that you should pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Adele's second album 21 is a truly amazing and thoroughly pleasing collection of Adele's newest songs with flawless performances, stretching her already stupendous vocal talents to a whole new level.  She sings each and every song (there's no filler here) with true conviction.  Of course, the lead single \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" is constantly thrilling and toe-tapping.  \\"Someone Like You\\" can make you cry, and so what?  That's what Adele does best - pull you in through every absorbing, emotional, powerful performance.
1557048630|5.0|This is one of my very favorite Art of titles...right up there with Art of Monsters Inc, and for the same reasons. The Art of How to Train Your Dragon is chock-full of concept artwork, and the only reproductions of movie stills are from a chapter appropriately titled Layout, Cinematography & 3D. So for those of you looking for concept work, this is the book for you. I would say it's as good as The Art of Monsters Inc., but the range of medium and style is not as broad in The Art of How to Train Your Dragon. An excellent title nonetheless.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of those books that stay with you forever. I am proud to have this book in my library and I will advise my daughter to read it as well. Five stars and no less. Great book!
B0007MTTF8|5.0|This is considered the Holy Grail of the Art of titles, and for good reason. The range of medium and style is almost limitless in this Art of title. There are no film stills from the movie, and it's a delight to look at all of the sketching styles. A true inspiration for artists. If you are on the fence about purchasing this title consider that a year ago a new condition copy (out of print, btw) was half the price that it is now, and I'm sure a year from now it will be significantly higher. Go ahead and take the plunge now...it's THE best of Art of title and no Art of collection is complete without it.
B004CLYKLI|1.0|I cringed putting the book down after realizing Amy Chua actually was NOT finished being a parent...even by western cultural norms.  He children, while accomplished at a young age, are not setting records or writing dissertations yet.  Nor had her youngest child even graduated high school.  So, I ask you,  How can a parent say \\"yeah, I did a good job\\" when they only finished two-thirds of the job?  You can't, unless...    Amy Chua is a narcissistic Ivy-league mother who is more privileged than ALL 600,000 women CURRENTLY living in China.  She's also, oddly enough, more privileged then even most U.S. Mothers (Add England, France, Germany, the entire UN...did I mention Africa?)  After reading this book while traveling through Yunnan, Sichuan, and finally Hunan, I thought \\"This isn't Chinese at all!\\"  Even if, as she advocates, her aggressive criticism of \\"foreigners\\" child rearing had merit based on the Chinese child development model, she failed to account for the rather spurious fact that she, herself, along with her husband, both come from a privileged class.    Must be nice to throw stones Amy Chua, when you only have to roll them down hill to hit your target.  Next time, try wearing my grandmother's shoes for a day.  Three sons, a husband who died of cancer when the oldest was 12, and working three (yes 3) full time jobs to feed, cloth, and, dare I say, LOVE, her family.  Ironically, the success or failure of her book's rhetoric now firmly rests on the shoulders of her adolescent girls; if they get into teen drugs, college pregnancy, or, hell, simply don't get the grade they thought they deserved -- are they now a failure?  I don't think so, however, Amy Chua will be ...and her book will go down as a testament of self-righteous adulation from a racist bourgeoisie mother.
0316067598|5.0|There is nothing I can add that others have not already.  This was an excellent book and am proud to have it in my collection.

B000KBGQYI|5.0|I've always enjoyed this adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\", but the picture which Amazon is using is incorrect.  This was one of my first experiences with Timothy Dalton, and I like him better here than as James Bond.  He's no rival to Orson Wells, of course, but there is a darkness in his portrayal that makes Rochester sinister and intriging at the same time.  Miss Clarke is a very convincing Jane Eyre, reserved but playful when she needs to be.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I actually prefer this updated version of the Karate Kid over the original one by far.  Perhaps my reasoning is because the movie was due for an update to break away from the typical 80's cheese and outdatedness.     It's about a boy and his mother who travel to China to start a new life, and the litle boy soon realizes that, in addition to not liking his stay in China very much, he doesn't like the fact his classmates are constantly picking on him.  In fact, \\"picking on him\\" is sort of a compliment compared to all that outside physical abuse on the playground he had to endure just by simply walking over to an attractive girl and talking with her about music.  Wow was THAT ever a rough day!    Anyway, as you can probably guess (even if you've never seen the original version, you can guess what happens) the little boy eventually meets Jackie Chan, a martial arts master.  He of course, teaches the young boy discipline and victory by way of his own techniques.      Now what I really like about this particular version of the movie is how a proper amount of time was devoted to every little area that makes these kind of films so much fun to watch in the first place.    You had quite a bit of emotional drama in the beginning while the boy was walking around the streets of China getting to know people, you had humor in some of the pranks the little boy would pull on his classmates (along with those lengthy and overdone jacket scenes.  Yeah, THESE segments certainly weren't necessary because they received too much attention- minor complaint here folks) and you even felt anger whenever the little boy was being ganged up on.  The feeling of hopelessness you had when the boy was outnumbered during that one back alley scene for example, made you angry I bet.  It should have, at least- that's a sign of good writing and storytelling.    I guess the only thing that was rushed were the actual segments where Jackie Chan's hard work and constant training *finally* kicked in and made sense to the boy.  These segments were surprisingly short and didn't occur until a good hour and 40 minutes went by, though I believe I know why- the film writers probably thought we've seen enough training segments over the years (especially back in the 70's and 80's- remember all those Rocky films?) so they probably felt it was better to not really touch upon them very often. Good move.    The boy who portrayed the bully was really mean and did a great job in his performance.    Overall, I'm really happy with the Karate Kid.  It does everything right.  A rare thing to see these days.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|Good action great plot it did leave me guessing a couple of times which I liked. I think both characters did a good job it's a movie I would rewatch again.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|My sister and I just love this CD of The Power.  I got the book, but we both find this audio CD is fabulous.  They took the time to make it so enjoyable to listen to with music, sound effects, and other people reading special sections.  I listen to it in my car and on my portable player whenever I can.  After listening to the whole set of 5 CD's, you can then listen to any one of them in any order and get more out of any CD every time you listen to them.  The author certainly knows how to put things in the correct order for learning, and also to make the learning fun and she explains the Law of Attraction very well.  Whenever you are out of sorts or down in the dumps, a listen to any CD of this book can bring you out of it quickly. Listening to it in traffic helps the time go by and the journey much more pleasant.  And, best of all, once you understand what The Power teaches about the Law of Attraction, you will find it does work.  It's logical and makes sense.  But you are taught that you must believe and feel what you imagine to make the things you want in life to come true.  And you can't fool yourself.  If you don't really believe it and actually feel it is true for you, it doesn't work because that's how it DOES work!  If you don't understand this, get the CD and let Rhonda explain.

B000JMLFLW|1.0|There are numerous errors in this Kindle version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Most of them are simple copyediting mistakes but occasionally dropped words entirely change the meaning of a sentence.<br /><br />This is NOT the way to experience one of the greatest novels in the English language.

B002ONC9NC|2.0|I just don't get the high praise for this movie. It struck me as highly implausible, silly and cliched, start to finish. A smart but bored 16 year old hops a ride with a strange older man who pulls up outside her school (apparently she's not smart enough to realize this is a bad idea) and embarks on an unlikely relatioship that, suprisingly,  her parents condone. There are some good performances here, though the talents of Emma Thompson and Alfred Molina are pretty well wasted on small supporting roles. Carey Mulligan as Jenny turns in a very engaging performance and helps me stay on through the end, but I just couldn't buy Peter Sarsgaard as a compelling seducer. One can't help wondering what young Jenny must be thinking! I guess that's the point here, but it could have been executed differently for better results. As packaged, I'm not buying the story. This was a Nick Hornby (About a Boy) adapted script so I had high expectations for it which were just dashed. Again, very cliche and predictable despite the talents of some of the cast.
B004EI3ON4|3.0|I wanted to \\"really\\" like this album.  It sounded so cool in the theater.  But listening to it apart from the emotion and action of the movie left me feeling like I was missing something.  The songs are all short in length.  And that doesn't have to make a difference, but mot of them feel incomplete.  They have no resolution.  They were obviously written for scenes in the movie that called for abrupt changes either in music or action.  If you like the artist and enjoyed the movie experience, you will still enjoy this soundtrack but not as much as if it were an album written to stand on its own.
0471043729|5.0|Professor Bard is the world's foremost authority in electrochemistry, and this is a very thorough documentation of the basic principles that are essential for understanding this vital field. The underlying mathematics are presented in fine detail, and the text also covers many important applications and analytical methods of electrochemistry.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is an excellent companion piece to the amazing Band of Brothers mini-series.  The look and feel of the piece is similar to BoB, except that this mini-series follows several different story lines of individuals, not a single company.  While this expands the scope of the story being told, it also has a tendency to allow the viewer to lose a little bit of intimacy with each individual.  With BoB, you got to live and breathe with the company, and understand who each of these men were, and completely invest in them as individuals.  With the Pacific, it is a little harder to completely buy in to each individual because the story moves between lines often.  But this is its only flaw.  It is brilliantly shot, compelling honest in its brutality, and provides tremendous perspective on what these heroes went through, and the sacrifices they all made for this country.
B001E95ZHY|1.0|The first 10 or so minutes are hilarious but as soon as it jumps to present day it all falls to crap. Wilson is the best part of The Office but he didn't do anything for this movie.     After the few minutes it just becomes one long kiddy movie with bad acting and bad music.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great action/comedy. Bruce Willis at his best both as an action hero and as a comedian. 4+ stars, just missed 5 stars because not enough of Morgan Freeman!!!
0375842209|5.0|If Death were a person..., he would have been busy during World War Two.  Yep, so he tells this captivating story about The Book Thief: a sad little German girl named Liesel placed with foster parents right in the middle of WWII. Though the story is hard to figure out at first - jumpy and confusing, it soon starts to make sense in a strange way. It is a chaotic time, and death tells the story in a sort of chaotic way: jumping here and there, putting questions in the reader's mind and then giving away some of the ending in bits and pieces.  Besides the complex little Liesel, Death also allows us into the lives of some other unforgettable characters: German and Jew, young and old, cold and warm.  Stick with the book for 15 or so pages, and then you will be hooked.  Oh,  and don't forget to go back and read the first few pages after you finish the book.  I might just reread the whole thing in a few months.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|My husband and I pre-ordered this DVD and watched it the day we received it.  As retired \\"FEDs\\" we loved it, although there may have been just a bit too much of the Bruce Willis Show.  It was fun to watch how the younger generation really believes that the older people haven't a clue, only to discover that old age and treachery sometimes overcome youth and enthusiasm.
B0043UGKAM|5.0|One of the best shows out there. Get past the first episode and from there on out it strikes the right note and never leaves you disappointed
0061353248|5.0|There are plenty of academic books that are brilliant in conception but a painful slog to read.  This book is brilliant while providing an entertaining read.  The thought-provoking insights into the nature of out decision making process are eye opening.  You will read this book and have thoughts like \\"that is me... and why do I do that?\\"
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Came in record time and I Loved it!
075666733X|5.0|This is a wondrous book that will take you to places unknown, (for most).     Great pictures, diagrams, and well explained functions about how our bodies work,  from muscles to nervous system, bones, tendons, organs, etc. - This has it all,   it's beautifully done, and thoroughly explained. -      Anything you want to know about the Human Body will be found within this marvelous book,  (Except,'How to FIX it!)

0739384171|2.0|This is not a review of the content of the novel but of its reading in the audio version. I have read Stieg Larsson's first novel and watched the DVD. They did an amazing job following the book and selecting actors who fit the images in my mind created by the novel. I was interested in listening to the second novel since it's hard to be pinned down reading for long. Many readers bring wonderful voices to the reading and since I don't speak Swedish, I thought it would be nice to hear some of the pronunciations correctly. I was very distracted by Simon Vance's reading. He gave many of the characters Cockney (or low British) accents. Couldn't they have found an English-speaking Swede to give this story a proper reading? I really feel it detracted from my enjoyment of the story.
B004LQI0HE|1.0|The plot can be summarized thus:  some people realize they are part of a truly evil scheme and they do nothing.  And by nothing I  mean literally \\"nothing\\".  They don't even seem to move much at all except for the occasionally eye flutter.  To call this a \\"movie\\" is simply false advertising as  no one moves.  If I found out that I was the victim of a nationwide conspiracy to use my organs without my permission, not only would I move I would make sure some of the evil snots went down with me.  I would slay - Conan the Barbarian style- every last one of the conspirators I could get my hands on.  In short, anyone who falls within the following categories will hate this movie with all the passion which it lacks:  (1) Americans (2) people with testosterone (3) people who have ever consumed caffeine (4)  anyone who ever got up off their butt to do anything at all.
B002SRQ214|5.0|procesador muy rapido y economico, lo recomiendo mucho, no hay necesidad de un Intel tan caro, con este tienes para juegos y para programas de cualquier tipo..
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I have to agree with J.G. Roselle's review of the [[ASIN:B002KSPKRS Ear Force X41 (XBOX LIVE Chat + Wireless Digital RF Game Audio with Dolby Headphone 7.1 Surround Sound)]]. I have to admit I was at first skeptical of the hype but it turns out these are both very light and comfortable AND sound good. A rare combination in most wireless units.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Best baby product ever. Great for babies in NICU since the pacifier won't keep popping out. Ibhave bought just about every style for my son or his cousin. She loves hers even at 21 months!
B00158K0S8|5.0|One of the best movies ever made about one of the most dynamic american individuals in modern times. Well done! Remastered. High def and standard def disks. I love this movie. I am not going to get into the story. If you are interested in this movie, you already know it. Profiles in greatness and humility.
B003UESJFG|3.0|Comment: Even though this was supposed to be a 3D \\"event\\", there is no Blu-ray 3D available to order at this time (02/2011). Being an adult I only buy these \\"cartoons\\" to experience the 3D. I found this movie to be... around the middle, boring. That is not to say it is a bad movie... but rather it is technically quite good. So are all the rest that have come before. So I must say that without the \\"bang\\" of the 3D effect... it is just another cartoon using the same old tried and true formula. Ho-hum.
B004LQ0ELO|5.0|I see one thing all these negative reviews have in common, their disinterest in philosophy, science, and religion. They seem like the people in the book too obsessed with the Redskins game to care about the events around them.    I personally thought that this was better than the Davinci Code, for it's breath of fresh air into a system that is so condemning of the pursuit of knowledge. The situations the characters get in are always exciting, and better, they always actually exist. The story is suspenseful and I was always waiting to find out what was going to happen next in the plot. I also was always trying to guess what was going to happen or what discovery they would make next based on my own research of symbols, religion, and philosophy.    It was a quick and exciting book, and I can't wait for the next one.    If you have done any reading into this subject, this book is totally fantastic, if not however, don't bother, you won't enjoy it.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|Out of the last 3-4 movies Cage has made, this one is at the top! This is the type of movie that he is good at!   The movie has plenty of action... including, a couple of awesome muscle cars, some chill guns & some very, very good looking girls. Oh, not to mention, some fantastic/VERY COOL 3D effects!!!  This movie is one of the better 3D movies I have seen so far!    This movie reminds me of Dusk till Dawn in some ways, except Cage lacks the Coolness! that Clooney had in Dusk till Dawn.  It is FRESH, EXCITING, and appeals to all audiences(with the exception of children)...     It is not a Top Grade movie or Top Grade effort from Cage, but the totally HOT girl makes up for a lot of his lacking in performance...    Overall, I will give this movie a B, but recommend that you go & see it in 3D & in the theaters...  thanks...
142311339X|5.0|After reading the whole Percy Jackson series of books and enjoying them tremendously, I decided to buy this book by Rick Riordan just a few weeks after it came out, and boy was I impressed!  This book is different because new characters are introduced, the main one being Jason and his two other teammates Piper and Leo, who have numerous adventures and death-defying cliff-hangers throughout the book.  In this book Percy Jackson is never seen, but he's still important because he's missing and is being searched for by all of his friends from the earlier series.  This book has a very interesting twist in how Jason and Percy are connected.<br /><br />Great adventure reading that also educates about history for either a kid or an adult!  I am really looking forward to reading the second book in the series, \\"The Son of Neptune\\" coming out in the fall 2011!
0399215921|1.0|I thought I was ordering the full-sized version of this classic book for use in my classroom!  However, what I got was an incredibly small sized version of the book!  There is NO WAY I can use this as a book to read to my students!  Wish this had been disclosed when I made the purchase!!!
B00005JMCW|3.0|This movie is one of the best that Lindsay Lohan made, and is a fun adventure that is very fast and hectic.  Lohan's Anna seems like a caricature of an indulgent, impossible teen, unless you actually have a teen of your own, that is, and have to survive every day with a tantrum that couldn't touch a 2-year-old's!  If you really liked the original Freaky Friday movie with Jodie Foster, this is a very different movie, and you probably won't like this one, but if you are looking for a way to spend a couple of light-hearted hours laughing, this movie is great, and Jamie Lee Curtis is really great in this, although Mark Harmon is very stiff and plays a mannequin.
B000E0LB8G|5.0|This is a three disc set and on the set I received Disc 3 was a Beethoven symphony and not the concertos and 3 sonatas as listed. The manufacturer evidently stamped disc 3 incorrectly and placed in the wrong set so two errors were made. The concertos on disc 1 and 2 are great so that is why I'm giving it 5 stars despite the error, but I still returned it.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I've always loved this movie. I got the DVD and love it as well. TV quality is great in my book since the movie was MADE FOR TV. Now mostly I want to address the reviewers who are complaining that the DVD is incomplete...well...YOU HAVE TO FLIP THE DISC OVER TO SEE PART 2 OF THE MOVIE! It's really not THAT hard of a concept to understand, so before leaving a bad review for a good movie, flip the disc over.    Plus, Tim Curry was amazing in this movie.
1599218011|3.0|I learned about Kris Carr through my adult daughter, who is a vegetarian, I think.  My daughter and I often share information about people and things that seem to revolve around being the best people we can be.  On that note, I find it interesting and positive that this woman \\"beat\\" cancer.  I have known a few women that have done so.  I have also known women who have died of a variety of cancers.  And while I like to read about and learn about people who have \\"beaten the odds\\" and have had an epiphany in the process, I recognize two things about life.  The first thing that I realize is -  We Are All Going To Die.  No one is getting outta here alive.  The second thing I realize is that, while some forms of dying may seem preferable to other forms of dying, I believe we each choose the way we die based on a lifetime of choices we've made and beliefs we have.  And I believe this is true whether you die at 1 day old or 100 years old or any age in between.  As humans, we tend to want to blame misfortune on powers outside of our control; and we like to give credit for miracles to better eating, more exercise, more positive thinking, prayer, belief in the Almighty, less fat, more vegetables, more sleep, less anger, etc., etc., etc.  No matter how you choose to live your life, realize two things.  (1)You ARE going to die, and (2) have fun living while you are living and stop obsessing about what you can do to delay the inevitable.  If there is one thing about Kris that I like, it is her exuberance for life and her willingness to go to any lengths to enjoy the life she believes she has been \\"re-given.\\"
B0034G4P7G|3.0|Please note: This is not so much a review of The Social Network as opposed to just my brief thoughts after watching the movie.<br /><br />I can't let the Oscars come and go without seeing at least one nominated movie so I watched The Social Network. I thought this was an entertaining movie only because of Aaron Sorkin's dialogue. Without that, I don't think I would have been impressed with the movie at all. I haven't read anything about Mark Zuckerberg and I was surprised to learn what a jerk he was (is?). However, I don't know how factual the source material (The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal by Ben Mezrich) is. My understanding is that Zuckerberg had nothing to do with the book so, unfortunately, we're hearing only one side of the story and like the old saying goes, \\"Until the lion learns to speak, the tales of hunting will always favor the hunter\\". The Social Network was an entertaining movie, brilliantly written, well directed and acted, but it didn't make me feel any better about wasting time on Facebook, or make me want to rush back to my Facebook account. I'm not sure the movie would have been nominated for Best Picture if the Oscar field were moved back to only five nominees.<br /><br />Five stars for Mr. Sorkin's writing. Three stars for the movie.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I have enjoyed catching up on the first season. I started watching about halfway through, so it was great to have more of a background on the characters.
B001CTDH76|2.0|Hi,    Like anyone reading this review I really enjoy \\"The Mentalist.\\" The show is exciting and humorous. Plus the character of Patrick Jane has a legendary smirk.     My issue is the main menu screen. There are no options. No choice of episode selection. No settings. Nothing. You have to play all the episodes. If you are looking for a specific episode you must fast forward to find them. It is really strange and frustrating.    It seems rather ironic to me that a show based on mental acuity can't seem to make a normal menu screen. That is a bit mental.    If you can get past that, the episodes are great.
1595141715|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why tells the tale of how Hannah Baker comes to kills herself, the reasons recorded on 7 tapes and mailed to the people mentioned on the tapes. It is a beautifully written intertwined with the voice on the tape and Clay Jenson's thoughts and actions as he listens to the tapes.     As a teen who has comteplated suicide before, this book has totally made me sit up straight and think about the consequences.It gives perspective on the people left behind in the tragic wake of a suicide. It helps show that sometimes people give up and don't want to look for help anymore and don't want to get better. They just want it to end. But those people sometimes never know about the friends or family who wanted to help but didn't know how. The people who might have contributed to a person's hell and never knew. This book helps the reader to understand the thoughts on both sides of the fence. It definitely makes me want to go out and try harder to touch people who might be struggling, and any thoughts of my own self-harm are completely gone. this should be on anybody's list to read. I highly recommend it.
B0032JTV74|3.0|The story is entertaining and rates 3 or 4 stars. However, the first disk was bad because the video and the soundtrack were not in sync. The other disks were fine. If the first disk wasn't bad, the blu-ray package would rate four stars.
0425220931|5.0|this is one of my favorite books.  i will always have a copy of this book no matter what.  it's spiritual journey, meets musical quest, meets self discovery.  awesome book that's not just about music but also a philosophy of how to live a better, more meaningful life.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|I absolutely adore this CD. Beautiful songs, endless melodies, soothing on the ears. Love songs with Danny's voice behind them are perfect for listening with the one you love.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|This movie has amazing depth and resonated with me on many levels. Will Smith's performance is excellent. The film is well done, drew me in and held my interest to the end.   Chris' struggle is as real as it gets. His perseverance and fortitude in spite of grueling life trials, is inspiring. It's also a testament to the power of a child's love and trust and the importance of keeping family together.      I HIGHLY recommend this film, and for family viewing.
030746363X|2.0|This book is hard to follow and apply what you have read. Too many medical terms to understand. I have not tried the weight loss program yet but I think it could work for losing pounds fast. Hope so.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've seen period! LOST kept me interested through about 75% of the series, this one almost lost me near the end but drew me right back in. I want to watch this again I love it so much. Sure there are some spots (second to last season) where things start to get a bit foolish (and into some of the final season) but it held my attention. If you don't want to watch it all you should at least watch the season with Forest Whitaker, he gives simply the best most outlandish on screen performances since William Shatner's performances on Star Trek!!!
B002RKRTGO|1.0|I am very excited about reading this book but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. I was really disappointed with ths version and am seeking another version to download.  Amazon please fix this ASAP. Sir Doyle would be appauled.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|I almost didn't watch this, but a friend's review sparked me to give this a try.<br /><br />Sadly,<br />This movie tried too hard to capture the feel of the original, which cannot be done.<br /><br />I felt no sympathy for Smith's character, and Jackie Chan was a pale comparison to Mr. Miyagi.<br /><br />His moves are always too choreographed and look fake. (I know, I know, they ARE fake, but in the original, and in other movies, the best 'fake' fight scenes LOOK real to the viewer.)<br /><br />What I gritted my teeth through was the fact that this seemed more about Will finding a vehicle for his son to make a name for himself in cinema. It falls terribly short.<br /><br />I agree with another review that Will and Jada can empty their deep pockets all they want, their kid is no actor!<br /><br />I do enjoy many of Will's movies, but this kid needs to stick to watching his dad's films rather than making his own.<br /><br />I'm just glad I got this during a Starz free preview weekend and didn't waste any money on it.

B0031YJFCQ|1.0|I finally gave in and read on of Stieg Larsson's books and I don't see what's supposed to be so great. OK potboiler beach reading stuff if you like that kinda thing, but I don't. A lot of bad writing, too, or maybe it's just bad translation. Bottom line, is there's a lot better stuff to use your reading time for.
B001FB55I0|1.0|This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this \\"HD\\" blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv. Even broadcast looks better on my TV...Story was mediocre, and special effects were OK ...would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the perfect mixture of action, romance, and suspense that will please all ages. Oftentimes the second book in series falls flat and is disappointing after the first book. This isn't the case with Catching Fire. The characters grow more sophisticated and become smarter as the book progresses. This is more than the average, clich&eacute;, teen romance novel with a stereotypical love triangle because these characters have much more at stake and much more to lose, their lives and the lives of everyone important to them. The amount of action in this book is enough to keep people who hate romance reading through the more romantic sections and the romance is enough to keep people who hate action reading through the action sections. People often say \\"I couldn't put this book down!\\" That statement is 100% true for this book, especially after the cliffhanger ending of The Hunger Games that left so many people wanting more!<br /><br /> Katniss Everdeen is causing more trouble than the Capitol would like, and they're determined to do something about it. Since competing in the Hunger Games, she has unintentionally caused a large scale rebellion through the districts of Panem, the country in a place that was once North America. The crackdown on the districts is becoming apparent when a new Peacekeeper is put in charge of District 12. He makes it impossible for Katniss and Gale to go hunting, by ensuring that the fence around the district is electrified 100% of the time. He catches Gale hunting and beats him to near death. Gale is saved by Katniss's mother, who is a fantastic healer. The love triangle between Peeta, Katniss and Gale is becoming extremely tricky. Peeta publicly proposes to Katniss to make it look like the two were not acting defiant in the arena, but acting out of love for each other. Katniss of course has to say yes to keep up the act, and a gigantic wedding is planned. She's conflicted, she loves Gale, but knows that she has to keep up the facade of loving Peeta so that President Snow doesn't have everyone she cares about killed. To make things worse, since she went into the arena rumors were sparked and now everyone thinks Gale is her cousin. Life is complicated for Katniss and as if that's not bad enough, it's coming close to time for the games to begin this year. Since Katniss and Peeta have won the games they're entitled to a life of luxury with money, all the food you could eat and no worries, right? Wrong. The 75th Hunger Games are coming up and that means it's time for the Quarter Quell. A Quarter Quell happens every 25 years to show that the Capitol has power. They add something extra to the games, for example one year twice the amount of tributes were sent into the arena. This Quarter Quell it's announced that that the tributes for the Games will come from the victors of the past games. Since Katniss is the only girl to have won from her district she is going back to the arena.

B001EN71CW|5.0|The best way I can describe it is \\"cowboys in space\\" - although please don't think \\"tacky\\" or \\"campy\\". It's NOT. It's hilarious, addicting, and sometimes shocking and dramatic. You'll find yourself getting very attached to some of the characters, and very much wishing YOU could wear a leather gun holster and boots while zipping around in space fighting the bad guys (and getting into a little trouble with the law yourself).
B002HFP0R4|3.0|As a fan of the Bee Gees and Andy Gibb I would like to recommend this effort, but there are several flaws with the selection of songs.  It's nice that they wanted to highlight Barry, Robin, Maurice and Andy on each disc, but amazingly this collection doesn't include the singles by Robin and Barry (Boys Do Fall In Love, Shine Shine, etc) that made the Top 40.  Plus one of my favorite Bee Gees songs is missing (Fanny (Be Tender)).  Nice try Brothers Gibb, but you've missed the Brass Ring.
0743297334|3.0|The novel is about a disillusioned group of expatriates who day after day go out in   search of a party, so that they do not have to confront their inner turmoil when left alone.   When Jake sees Brett--the woman he loves--with other men, he passively goes along with the situation; it is only at night that his true emotions come out: \\"This was Brett, that I felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car . . . and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the day, but at night it is another thing\\" (Hemingway 42). This shows that in the day he might be able to mask his pain--with drinks and friends--but at night his tortured soul makes itself known. However, the revelations of the night before are quickly shoved under the rug and the next day or week the cycle repeats itself. He does not even try to get Brett for himself; he acts like the battle has already been lost and that any future actions he might take would be utterly futile, which is true because he has lost his manhood and there lies the tragedy of Brett and Jake's relationship.             Jake does not suffer alone. All the characters in the book act like fate has been decided for them and remain compliant in nature. Cohn the Jew--always the outsider, even in his own country--perhaps suffers the most acutely. He desperately wants to find a place of acceptance and belonging, and is disillusioned into thinking that South America holds his answers. Jake tries to talk sense into him saying, \\"Robert going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tied all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. . . . If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same\\" (19). He clings the hardest to his affection for Brett, because for once someone chose to be with him and he cannot fathom that it was not real. He pathetically follows Brett and Mike around like an affectionate puppy trying to get a moment of attention, which becomes incredibly annoying to the reader.                 Brett is not a likeable character. She causes most of the pain and suffering of the men by toying with their hearts' and causes bitterness and conflict among them. You could say she was an early proponent of sexual liberation and femininity, however, that doesn't really describe her character because she often relies on men to pick up the pieces. Throughout the book she is such a pitiable, broken thing that regrets not making things work with Jake. Therefore she is not a strong female character.                 All in all the plot was a little dry with endless drinking and partying. None of the characters seem to need to work, so it was a bit infuriating listening to them complain bitterly about their lives. But as my friend pointed out, it is important to remember the context of the novel and how everyone was so disillusioned after the war that productivity, change, and hope seemed pointless. I thought the bull fighting and the bull fighters themselves were highly entertaining and symbolic; Romero represents the invincible, youth full of hope and wonder, while Belmonte full of bitterness and disillusionment represents old age. I thought Jake and Brett's relationship was touching at times, but could have been developed more. As far as style I prefer more complex sentence structure and language then Hemingway's work but I recognize his talent for the written word.
1416955070|3.0|To keep it simple, this is very similar to other books labeled, 'young adult urban fantasy'; however, I will have to say that I am glad I bought the bulk set. I could not have read book one without reading further. I am not the biggest fan of Clary, nor her name (maybe it just wasn't simple enough to be seamless). Maybe it will grow on me as the series continues.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are well-written and I like the familial aspect. Good read, I would say 7th or 8th graders could pick it up and read it quickly.
1594202842|5.0|I liked her writing style and humor.  It's obviously not a parenting book; so it's too bad that people have been so critical of her.
0316779237|4.0|Easy read, funny but not as funny as some of this other works. Still, you can't go wrong ordering this book - especially for the holidays.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|One of the best books i've read in a long time! When I read it,I learned a lot of weird words with lots of weird meanings.I especially liked when Sunny Baudelaire yells words no one can understand.
0439023521|5.0|Great book. Read all three over a weekend. Downloaded them to my blackberry from my amazon app. Loved the books so much, had to buy them. Recommend buying all three, because trust me, you will want to read the whole set. I read online they are making a movie. Read the books first, then go see the movie, I think its opening 2012????
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This was a very well done black comedy/drama.  I laughed, cried, waited in anticipation, suspense.  A very well done movie with a good cast.
0385339089|1.0|The main character Mark Sway got on my nerves from the very beginning. He was a little snot nose who is disrespectful to just about everyone throughout the entire book. From the way the book is written you are suppose to feel sorry for this kid and his family, however as the story moves forward, Mark becomes less deserving of sympathy and more deserving of a spanking. The attorney Mark ends up hiring, Reggie Love, is also annoying and disrespectful. I hated both characters and by the end of the book I was hoping that the New Orleans Mob would find both of them and rub them both out.     This is the fifth John Grisham book I've read. In the other books, Grisham was pretty balanced regarding his characters. There were good attorneys and bad ones. Good law enforcement and bad ones. The Client is derogatory towards every single law enforcement official, prosecuting attorney, and authority figure that the main characters come across. All the FBI Agents, U.S. Marshals, police officers, corrections personnel, and prosecutors are painted as incompetent and corrupt. Reggie Love and Mark Sway go around threatening to sue everyone who is trying to help them and it really got old. People like Grisham's Sheriff Ozzie Walls was obviously far from the authors mind when he wrote this book. I hope the next Grisham book I read is not like this; however it will be a while before I read another one of his books.
0802473156|5.0|This book is an eye-opening look at the various ways in which people interpret the expressions of love. It is an easy and informative read, including vignettes that illustrate the various experiences of the author as he worked with couples to decipher their \\"love languages\\". A rewarding read for anyone looking to improve relations with a loved one.
B001F0WXY0|3.0|$16.99 (as of 4/24/11) for an ebook? Shameless to the point of being disgusting. One of the best novels of its genre deserves better than to end up as a posterboy for the lessons that book publishers refuse to learn from the music industry. 4 1/2 stars for the novel itself, 1 star for Peguin's stupidity in doing all they can to encourage piracy amongst fans who would be all too happy to pay a fair price.
B000FC10MU|3.0|A conceptually interesting book.  Gaiman brings a fairly original idea to life and wraps a good story around it.  The central characters of the book are engaging and interesting.  I do have a few notes of caution for the prospective reader.  Gaiman has a tendency to exit the story and talk directly to the reader (one might think of these sections as a lecture).  I'm not a big fan of authors using their books as an overt pulpit, and in this case it was rather annoying.  From a plot perspective, the book runs out of steam about two thirds through.  Fortunately, there is a conclusion that wraps things up neatly.  Gaimain also demonstrates a tendency also to throw horror elements into the story that do absolutely nothing to move the plot forwards; they simply seem to be in place to titillate the reader.<br /><br />So to summarize, a decent plot, good writing, interesting concept.  On the whole, I'd recommend reading the book just for the concept and the interesting characters.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|First of all, if you do not like the xbox 360 controller then do not buy this.  I love the xbox 360 controller.  I feel it is the perfect controller.  I have a PS3 though and do not feel like buying an xbox just because the contoller is better.  So, I went online looking for an xbox 360 controller for the PS3.  I found this and bought it at Gamestop for $40.  This is the perfect controller for FPS games.  I play Black Ops with this and it is great.  I love the offset and concave analog sticks.  If is much more comfortable than the nubs on the PS3 controller.  The silicon like surface on the controller makes it so people with sweaty hands won't have to worry about wiping their hands on their shirt after long gaming sessions. The controller is almost identical to the xbox controller except for the L2 and R2 \\"trigger\\" buttons.  They are not like the Sixaxis controller where the L2 R2 buttons have no guard and are very sensitive, but are more similar to he xbox triggers and are in my opinion better.  The controller also vibrates.         Setup takes five seconds.  Literally.  You insert the USB receiver into the PS3 and hit the button on the receiver.  Then hit the PS button on the controller and it is set.  I can bring the controller to friends homes and play it on their PS3s because I can set it up instantly and bring it home and hook it back up to my system.           There are a few flaws.  The D-Pad.  When sending messages to friends online I use my D-Pad.  Sometimes I hit the up button and the cursor moves right.  It happens when you hit the right side of the \\"up\\" button.  You must hit the buttons straight on.  The only other flaw is that it takes up a USB slot and i only have two so i am constantly taking things in and out of the slots.  That is it.  But, the charging cable plugs into the receiver, so the controller charges in the same USB input so the controller takes up a total of one USB input.  Unfortunately, the charging cable charges this controller, but not my sixaxis controllers for some reason.  So it can not act as  a charging cable for your other sixaxis dualshock controllers.         Overall, when a much worse sixaxis dualshock controller costs $55 this much better controller which is great for Killzone and COD only costs $40.  It is the closest thing to an xbox 360 controller for your PS3.  I believe the charging cable is 6 feet long and a fully charged Power A Pro Elite conrtoller lasts about the same lenght as the sixaxis dualshock.  If you are looking for a great, cheap, xbox-like controller then this is the right product for you, it was for me.
0385339607|5.0|This 600-page monster of a novel grabs you from the very start and does not let go. Although I must admit that the beginning is slow, tracking the career progress of the hapless narrator, Rudy Baynor as he goes from one disaster to another. However Grisham manages the difficult task of keeping the reader emotionally invested for the first 250 pages or so of slow but steady buildup. Then once the central case of the novel begins in earnest around page 300, you are hooked and ready for the goodies, which are duly delivered as you read on.     The first person narrative really makes the difference, making the story realistic and believable, and the main character is developed throughout the novel as he goes through various personal and professional trials in his turbulent career start as a lawyer. He struggles with his conscience and self-doubt (due in part to his low socio-economic status) in some of the cases that he tackles alongside his less consciencious yet sympathetic partner, and this really makes his character seem flesh-and-blood.     The intricate details of court proceedings and legal manoueverings are fascinating, and would otherwise be unknown to someone like myself, who has not had much previous exposure. Also, central to the novel is the murky insurance business, which is portrayed as dirty and immoral. The author does hide his disgust and rage at the powerful corporations that take advantage of the simple folks. He uses \\"corporate thug\\" label several times throughout the novel.    I like Grisham's style more and more with each novel I read. He has a way with words, and ability to describe feelings and places with quick, bold brushstrokes, without sacrificing depth. Sort of like gazing at an impressionist painting from a distance, it all fuses together into a cohesive, well composed whole.    The ending is a bit of a letdown, but not impossible, if you think about it. Perhaps he rushed to complete the novel, and did not lay down all the possibilies in acomplex situation.    Overall impression - a truly fantastic, thought-provoking, multi-layered novel, one of his very best, head and shoulders above other mass-market novels.
B003YP7N9O|5.0|I need help. In the early 2000's. I bought Jethro Tull's This Was, Stand Up, Benefit, War Child, Minstrel in the Gallery and Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll- Too Young to Die! They were remastered and had Bonus Tracks. They had the must incredible sound and had a separation where you could hear every instruments. This is hard to explain but some instruments were up front and some in the back (separation). The sound was not flat like the CD's I have now. The best sounding CD's I think I have every heard. Here's the mistake I made. I made my own CD's so I could have my own box set and sold them. I had The Anniversary Collection which had Tull's hits. So when I made my own CD's I just up loaded the album cuts and not the hits on The Anniversary Collection. Which I thought would sound the same. Then years later after a moved I uploaded everything to my computer and found the sound on The Anniversary Collection was not as loud as the album cuts I had uploaded and the sound was not very good (Flat). So I bought the 2008 The Anniversary Collection (Remastered) that came out. What a rip off, it's the same as the The Anniversary Collection from 1993 that I had. Anyway I decided the sound was to good on the Tull CD I bought back in early 2000's. So I re-bought all 6 CD's remastered with Bonus Tracks. But all 6 sounded like the The Anniversary Collection not the incredible sound I had. I compared them with the album cuts I had saved. So I re-bought them again. Same thing. Can someone tell me why the same CD sound different? And does anyone know if there are 2 set of remastered CD's from 2001-2003 of the same CD's and why they would change the mix. Also how I can tell which are which so I can buy the ones with the great sound. The sound is that good believe me it jumps with separation out of my headphones. You can really tell the difference with headphones.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|In 2009, Josh Fox was approached by a natural gas-drilling company to purchase the rights to drill under his eastern Pennsylvania property for natural gas.  Fox was offered $100,000 for his gas rights, but he was concerned about rumors of problems with natural gas drilling in other communities.  Armed with his suspicions, a wry sense of humor and a video camera, he set out to investigate.    Pockets of natural gas have been safely drilled in America for decades.  But rising demand for natural gas has drillers looking to less easily-recoverable sources.  A new process called \\"hydraulic fracturing\\" is being used by companies like Cabot Oil and Gas and Chesapeake Energy to extract natural gas that is bound up in the rock of a geologic formation called the Marcellus Shale, which stretches from New York and Pennsylvania through West Virginia, Ohio and into eastern Kentucky and Tennessee.    Hydraulic fracturing - also known as \\"fracking\\" - injects enormous quantities of water and a witches brew of toxic chemicals including benzene and glycol ethers, under extremely high pressure to break up the underground shale formation, releasing the natural gas from the rock.  The gas is then pumped to the surface where it is processed, compressed, and then piped away.  Some of the water and toxic chemicals used to fracture the shale are pumped back to the surface, and stored in open pits.  Thanks to the \\"Halliburton Loophole\\" passed in 2005 during the Bush-Cheney administration, natural gas drilling is exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act.    In \\"Gasland,\\" filmmaker Fox travels to Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas to visit communities that have been greatly impacted by natural gas exploration, and he documents the problems there.  A scarcity of clean water is one of the greatest problems in arid western states, so pumping millions of gallons of water underground is a huge concern.  Water contamination is another.    Fox visits several people who haveproblems with contamination of their well water, allegedly due to the fracking.  Hair loss in pets, headaches, brain lesions are reported.  In Dimock, Pennsylvania one resident said \\"Our water was perfectly fine, and then right after they started drilling, propane and stuff like that ...\\"    In one of the most startling moments I have ever seen in a documentary film, Fox visits the home of a Weld County, Colorado resident named Mike Markham who claims that he can light the water coming from his kitchen faucet on fire, because the fracking near his home has allowed the underground natural gas to infiltrate his well water supply.      Markham holds a butane lighter up to the faucet, then slowly turns on the water.  The flame flickers, but nothing happens.  \\"Just give it a second here,\\" he says.  Seconds roll by slowly, and still ... nothing.  It looks like a big anti-climax, then suddenly WHOOM!!  The kitchen sink explodes into a ball of fire.  Markham staggers back, laughing and brushing his forearms.  \\"I smell hair!\\" he says.     In one of the film's most touching moments, Fox visits Wyoming cattle rancher John Fenton.  Fenton, the son of \\"old-time cowboys\\" is eloquent and evokes all the ideals of the American West.  His property is surrounded by 24 gas wells.  Vapors from the condensate tanks are sometimes so bad that they surround his house in a brown cloud.  His wife Kathy suffers from headaches and dizziness, and a loss of smell.  Fenton shakes his head as he looks at his herd of cattle.  He calls his water \\"the damnedest-smelling stuff, comes out different colors all the time ... I don't know how they (the cattle) even drink it.    \\"We want to raise the best, most natural clean product we can raise ... but if you're breathing in dirty air and drinking water that could be tainted, what's coming out in these cows?  You gotta be sure that what you're putting in `em is as pure as it can be.  Cute as they are, in a year or two they're going to be on someone's dinnerplate.    \\"We need to speak in a unified voice, and stand up to these a******.\\"    I highly recommend this film.  Fox uses his sense of humor - and his banjo-playing - to make what could be a highly depressing film enjoyable and even funny.

B003R50FRI|4.0|A wonderful novel full of honesty, poetry and drama. I read it shortly before travelling to India, and on visiting that country I finally saw what an accurate and funny portrayal of Indian life this book is. But best of all is the finely crafted magic Roberts achieves in Shantaram. A fine novel.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Loved this! My hubby and I are addicted and couldn't wait to get the Season 4 DVD, we watched all the episodes over a three-day jaunt...it was chillingly fun!
B0046LVCEM|2.0|I am very disappointed that all the figures/illustrations are missing. If the publisher wishes to sell an ebook, then the ebook should contain all that is in the printed book. If for some technical or other reasons that it is not able to do so, then this should be stated in the original book review. Otherwise it is plainly deceptive selling.
0515141429|5.0|I love Jack Reacher, all his books are excellent, you know he's going to come out in the end ok, but it's exciting getting there.
B002RKS81O|3.0|The story is wonderful but the format leaves something to be desired.  I found the numbers and quotations for the pictures distracting.  What's the point if there is no link to the photo?
B003LZ5B7S|3.0|I feel that this series is not the strongest of the newer ones. The stories are not as strong nor is the actor that plays the doctor. I can see why he only lasted one season.

B0043A0U9E|5.0|In 1970, pop star little Stevie locked himself in a room full of instruments (among them some great analogue synthesizers). He demanded that his record company let him make an album of original music coming from only one source: his own mind. The songs are great, the singing excellent, and the music is pure soul ahead of its time. Amazing! I have bought four versions of this classic album through the years: the original LP used, then a new LP with a better pressing, then the first CD version which sounded a little harsh, then the second CD release, and now this gold version.
0446691437|5.0|Pressfield is fantastic.  I read and loved Gates of Fire, and when I read the description of this book I knew I would love it too.  He's an incredibly reflective and observant individual and writer, and he's able to capture the essence of the internal struggle we all face in our quest for self-fulfillment.  He describes in beautiful and accessible language our greatest secret: we're our own biggest obstacle to happiness and self-fulfillment.  You should read this book, and anything else by Pressfield you can get your hands on.
B001208QSA|5.0|This CD stands alone in its own right, as well as a beautifully apt score to a movie. Most of the Glass hallmarks are there, the repetitions, the slow building of change, the shimmering dissonance, the beautiful, yearning melodic musicality, but packaged in more bite sized morsels, piece on piece, to fit the demands of a film score. And moreover a film which perfectly is attuned to the reflective, interior, plangent and yearning landscape which Glass often inhabits.<br /><br />The more I steep myself in Glass's music (and I'm pretty steeped in it!) the more I find myself questioning the use of the term minimalist or minimalism to describe his music. I find him an intensely romantic musician, and this music in particular is romantic in the way that Rachmaninov's music is romantic - lyrical, melodic, with the arc of a musical line very clear, and with a blue, often minor key unresolved longing built into it.<br /><br />The Hours is particularly fine in hinting at subtexts below the sometimes busy dynamics of a piece - listen to 'I'm Going To Make A Cake' for an example, where there are phrases of turbulence and activity, quite unsettling, and simultaneously something deep, slow, sorrowful and painful in the theme. Very apt for acting as counterpoint to the women's lives (in the film/book) where there is actually huge drama and intensity going on, but its driven by interior landscape.<br /><br />This is Glass for when I need a Glassfix but don't have the time to listen to a 20 minute piece, as each track here has its own completion, as well as being part of a whole. Except that, as always with his music, I end up wanting more, so arrive late at my destination............
B000002KBT|4.0|This album is NOT a bunch of noises. This album is NOT too eccentric. IT IS bad ass and awesome. YOU CAN be in the middle on this THERE IS a middle ground. From my first listen i give this gem 3 1/2 stars and i bet you that rating is only going up with time. I was expecting NO melody and a bunch of noises after reading both good and bad reviews. All this album is is music played with a unique structure and although it is \\"weird,and eccentric\\" it doesn't come close to some of the eccentric crap that is considered unlistenable. If you like Old beck ala. western field in moonlight,stereophonic soulmanure,golden feelings,etc..... you'll probably like this (considering no offense beck (who's awesome!!!) you were riding the captain's dick HARD back then). Also if you like old ween there IS a good chance you'll like this. If you like weird alternative in general, this album probably wont hit you as hard and it wont strike you as unlistenable as the other reviews state it to be and if you also like influential music you'll probably like this. Highly Recommended (Unlike my grammer)    Once again excuse my poor grammer, written in a rush 3/4 a sleep.................Goodnight!!!  -Robert

1423113497|5.0|You know the Greek myths? The Roman myths? The Gods, Hercules, etc. Well, what if they were all real? Percy Jackson discovers that all the strange things in his life can be traced back to those supposedly mythical beings. Not only that but his father is none other than Poseidon, one of the Big Three. There's a problem though: The Big Three had agreed not to have any children due to a prophecy. Percy was born illegally! Meaning, the other Gods want him destroyed. When Zeus's master lightning bolt is stolen, Zeus thinks that Poseidon is to blame. Percy, in an attempt to clear his father's name and prevent a war (and find his mother) accepts a quest to the Underworld where he uncovers a much greater danger than imagined.    My friend recommended this book to me. He and I enjoy Terry Brooks books, which is actually how we became friends in the first place, so every so often we swap new books that we're reading. This was one of his better recommendations.    Riordan does a lot of great things in this book. For one, each character is distinct and believable. You get a sense of who each one is and each one feels real and sympathetic. Riordan's plot is well thought out with hints along the way that allow the alert reader to discover the truth while leaving a few surprises within. While he isn't as clever as J.K.Rowling (there just isn't the same depth and detail) this is a more than enjoyable read, worth the time. It's also just come out as a movie and I generally find that the book is better.    I can't wait to get the next book in the series.
1933308087|5.0|This book is quite literally an encyclopedia of quilt block designs. No doubt it took thousands of hours to compile it. The beautiful photograhpy inspires creativity and ideas. Each illustrated quilt block is also illustrated as a line drawing making extremely complex designs seem doable. Jinny Beyer is an amazing quilt artist, has an incredible gift for design and color, and this documentary encyclopedia is probably all the quilt design idea book you'll ever need.
0385737955|5.0|Every month one boy is brought up to the Glade in the elevator with no memory of anything but their first name. Thomas's arrival is much the same, as unremarkable as any other arrival. He is quickly introduced to life in the Glades. The area they live in is surrounded by stone doors that close at night, separating them from the surrounding maze and the Grievers, dangerous creatures that prowl the maze. During the day, they explore the maze in hopes of finding a way to escape. But the day after Thomas comes, a girl arrives with a message: everything is going to change. And there's something about the girl that's familiar to Thomas. Thomas might know more about the maze and how to escape, if only he could remember it.    The first few pages of this book are a little slow. I think this is mostly because it's all inside the character's head with very little actually happening. (Basically Thomas is in the lift, wakes up, has no memory, and the lift rises.) But as soon as it reaches the surface and he's brought into the Glades, the book really picks up. Dashner has thought of just about everything-how the boys survive, a vocabulary unique to their experiences (though I wonder if some of the new kids pick up that vocabulary a little too quickly for it to be natural), a hierarchy of sorts, different personalities, etc. It is such an intricate world that it is easy to get lost in it.    He has built solid characters, I believe their reactions and care about their survival. There are some characters it would have been nice to know more about (though I suppose that is difficult since they don't really know anything about themselves), but it makes sense that if a boy's memory goes back only a month, there is less to reveal about him than someone whose memory goes back a year or two, etc.    Not every detail involved is a surprise (if anyone was paying attention, they should be able to figure out where the escape route is fairly early on), but there are more than enough surprises to keep you interested. And of course, there is the biggest question of all: who put them in the maze and why?    This is definitely one of the better series that I have read in a while (a few of the ones that I've picked up lately have been particularly solid). Book two is already out and reading it is a high priority. This is a series that I would love to see made into a movie.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Other than Bale's ridiculous faux metal Batman voice, this is--in my opinion--the best Batman and the best comic book movie ever. The music is incredible and Ledger's Joker is outstanding. There will never be another performance in any comic book movie that'll ever top what he did with that character. It's one of the few characters in a movie that I think truly overlapped the actor, making you forget that it's not just THE JOKER on the screen.
0810993139|3.0|Greg Heffley begins keeping a journal at the insistence of his mother where he relays his middle school and life adventures. Greg wants to be popular, even mildly, and one particular challenge is his less than cool best friend Rowley. (Specifically, while Greg considers himself at the middle of the popularity scale, he thinks Rowley is firmly at the bottom.) While worrying about his popularity, he must also deal with his bullying brother Rodrick and some bullying older kids. Greg's pursuit for popularity leaves him not particularly considerate of his friends, which ultimately gets him in trouble, but underneath all the troublemaking he has a good heart.    I saw the movie before I read the book but there was so little change between them that it doesn't make much difference. What makes this book unique is that Greg could come off as completely unlikeable but thanks to some funny stick figure drawings for comic relief, he ends up being more lovable than you might expect.    This isn't the most adult book and won't be something I continue reading. It isn't bad, but even for me, someone who loves kids' books, this is too juvenile. It's fun for a laugh (and I plan to read the hebrew versions of some of the books to work on my language skills which will be more challenging and best served with a simpler plot for now). If you have a young child though, this is a good thing to give them to get them started reading. It still has some pictures so they won't get bored, but it has enough text for them to get used to chapter books.
1400052173|5.0|I accidentally stumbled across this book and what a thought provoking experience! I use this book as a reference to my nursing students for a number of courses. I have been a nurse for 40 years and this book was a slap in the face for me- a forced confrontation that medicine and health care are not just \\"the good guys\\" in our quest to conquer disease and death.  It was a difficult pill for me to swallow but one that I knew I must if I were going to be an advocate for patients and families. This book really takes you on a journey of realizing what is done to the disenfranchised patients in the name of medical research. I think this book should be required reading for all health care professionals, especially those engaged in research of any type.
0316098337|5.0|Jack has lived his entire life in Room, with only his mother for company. It's all he's ever known. His friends are Dora, from TV, and Rug, Bed, and most importantly, Ma. At night, comes Old Nick, the only other person Jack has ever seen, with some supplies. What Jack doesn't know, is that he and his mother are captives and that there is an entire world Outside Room. As Jack gets older and more curious about the world, Ma realizes that they can't stay there. It was time for her and Jack to escape.    Told from five-year-old Jack's perspective, this is easily one of the most compelling and interesting stories I have read in a long time. We are fully enveloped in Jack's world, learning as he does, feeling as he does. Even though we come in knowing all the things he doesn't we still discover the world with him, seeing everything in a new light.    I love that most people would have left the story with the breakout, but Donoghue goes beyond that. She gets into the heads of her characters to the point where she thought about what it would be like for them to return to the world. The camera crews, the family reactions, the public reactions, all of it is so thought out and true to life (it's eerily accurate and not just a little bit of a sad commentary on today's media and society). How would Jack feel being in Outside? How would Ma feel after so long locked up? How would people view them and respond to their plight?    Some people say it's gimmicky to write the book from Jack's perspective. I disagree. I think the only way to really give the proper complexity (what Ma sees as good isn't necessarily what Jack sees as good because he doesn't have an understanding of Outside) is to do it this way. Told from the perspective of Ma, I don't think the story would have been nearly as successful. It would too sad and overwhelming. In this way, there's still hope and confusion. And we get a perspective we could otherwise never get.    Having read this, I can't wait to check out some of Donoghue's other books, in hopes that they will be even remotely as good.
B000KZBRG6|4.0|I keep this in my jacket pocket for metering old cameras. It's so light I forget it's there. It seems so far (about a year) to be more rugged than it's lightness suggests. Never had a problem with the exposure it suggests.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars, but it comes with a shoe adaptor so it might be attached to a camera, and I didn't find it to stay put on my cameras. It was loose and couldn't get adjusted. This belongs around your neck or in your pocket anyways.
0375847227|5.0|Somehow I haven't written about one of my all-time favorite book series. It's one of those books that I like to go back to every so often-usually after I've finished a long, serious book-when I want something familiar and of excellent quality. I first came across this series in college, thanks to a college course Adolescent Literature: Grimm to Voldemort (I know, sounds awesome right?) and am eternally greatful to Professor Flesch for assigning it. It is the only book series to ever make me cry and, as my friends can tell you, I don't cry easily or often. And I cry every time I read it (and even discover new reasons to cry each time). Pullman has the ability to really get the heartrending emotions being experienced by the characters onto the page in a way that I've yet to find another author able to do.    You may remember when the movie came out for the Golden Compass, the first book in the series. There was the usual controversy over something that went against the Church (even though the first book actually has very little of this and it is the latter part of the series that really shows the anti-religion plot). And then there's the issue of talking animals on screen. It just doesn't work, they always look goofy and unnatural (because of course it is unnatural and therefore requires computer animation). But in the book it works perfectly and you can't help but love the daemons and the witches and the armored bears and every other fantastical people that Pullman invented.    The series starts off with Lyra, a young girl who has spent her life running around Oxford College with little care for anything beyond her curiosity and sense of adventure. But when her best friend Roger is kidnapped (in a series of kidnappings rumored to be done by \\"the Gobblers\\") she vows to rescue him. And so begins her journey, with a number of set backs and adventures along the way. But it turns out that freeing Roger is only the first of many things to come. The witches have a prophecyabout her, one which says her decisions can change the course of the future. Lyra, together with her daemon Pantalaimon (a daemon is an external part of the human being that takes the form of an animal), and equipped with the altheiometer (a golden compass that she can ask questions and get the truth) set out on a long journey.    Book two, the Subtle Knife, begins with Will, a boy from our world whose mother is mentally ill. He discovers another world where he meets Lyra. While trying to find out more about what is happening, they meet Dr. Mary Malone who is working on dark matter experiments in our version of Oxford. Will gains possession of a powerful weapon, the Subtle Knife. The knife and the altheiometer are important instruments that are highly coveted, leading the two into more danger. At the end of book two, Lyra is kidnapped and Will sets out to save her.    Finally, in the Amber Spyglass, Will finds Lyra and together they set out for the land of the dead where part of their true purpose becomes clear. But a war is looming, can they survive?    Considering that this is a children's series, the plot is anything but simple. In fact, it is possibly one of the most complex books I have ever read, full of big ideas and questions that always keep you thinking and guessing. In fact, it is the type of book you need to read multiple times because reading reveals new layers of understanding.    If there was ever a book series that you should read, I would suggest this one. In fact, I did just that to a friend of mine who did not enjoy reading. I told her to try this book because there was no chance she wouldn't like it. Sure enough, she read the entire series and has since begun reading other things.

0374531269|3.0|Most twelve year olds you know spend their time collecting WII games, trying to prove themselves on the basketball court or baseball field, and are just discovering that maybe girl cooties aren't so bad. In war torn Sierra Leon, life is not nearly so simple. That families are destroyed and people are murdered are the least of the dangers there. Young boys are forced to choose sides and take up weapons in order to survive. Civilians run from them, soldiers see them as reinforcements, and their actions will haunt them for the rest of their lives.    In A Long Way Gone Ishmael Beah courageously tells us about his flight from the rebels, the loss of his family, his forced conscription into the government army, and his fight for rehabilitation afterwards. Despite everything, Beah doesn't hold anything back about his experiences. The honesty and pain behind his words makes his autobiography compelling and unforgettable.    Beah learned firsthand of how hatred and revenge can ruin a nation and scar a person's life. But he also shows the resilience of children, who can survive even the darkest parts of humanity. But most amazingly, Beah comes out of his experience with hope for the future instead of a hate-filled heart. There is a chance, if people learn from his story, that the world can be made better and the evils of humanity can be made better.    While I would have liked more physical description in order to help me fully see the world he comes from, I can hardly fault him. Just delving into these memories must have been painful and his ability to confront his pain and push on in spite of it (or perhaps because of it) is inspiring. This is a book no one will soon forget.
0385342047|2.0|DISCLAIMER: SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />The title Mini Shopaholic indicates that this book is (supposed to be) about Becky's Daughter, Minnie. But nope. Minnie was not the central of the story. Minnie is only the center of the story in probably 20% of this book. The rest is about Becky trying to throw a surprise party for Luke, her husband. Many aspects in the story seemed forced, made you cringe and silently (or loudly) thinking \\"what a BS\\". Luke, although I get he's a big shot in what he does, I doubt the royal family would bother to send a youtube video just to join the fora singing Happy Birthday for him. I doubt the tribute videos for his birthday in youtube would reach hundreds of thousands of hits in a day only.<br /><br />And what does recession mean for a wealthy family anyway? Probably only a speck of dust in their lives. I doubt it would make a huge of an impact like what this book is trying to portray. And why the Reverend cared too much about his money in the bank anyway. A cynical view about the church? Just for humor sake? Another pointless filler in the story.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Shopaholic series. But this latest installment would be buried in my library. i doubt I would want to read this for the second time.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind, really, to wait a little longer, if that means the story would be improved. It was still somewhat entertaining, at least for first timers (who never read the previous books). And for someone who has been following the series you wouldn't say it's a good book after you finished, if you ever... I felt like I couldn't finish it but it helped me pass my time in the bathroom.<br /><br />If I could return this book, I would.
142311339X|5.0|Much as I enjoyed Rick Riordan's The Red Pyramid, I am sure I'm not the only one to be happy for the return to the Greek (and apparently Roman) Gods. Unlike the Percy Jackson series, where we only follow Percy, this series allows us to follow three characters: Jason, Piper, and Leo. Like the Red Pyramid, this book shows how Riordan has grown in his writing skills and characterization, as these characters each come out interesting and more complex than, say Grover of Percy's series.    Jason has no memories before waking up beside Piper and Leo but he has a surprising amount of knowledge of the Roman Gods. Piper's father has been missing for three days and she knows that to get him back, she may have to betray the people she's closest to. Leo, has always had a skill with machines and metal, and most especially, fire.    Annabeth has been searching for Percy, who has gone missing without a trace. Her search leads her to Jason, Piper, and Leo, who she brings back to Camp Half-Blood where they get their first quest and discover some important truths about themselves.    Most importantly, while they thought that Kronus was bad, there is something much worse in store. The prophecy at the end of the Percy Jackson series has come to pass, much sooner than anyone expected and the seven heroes begin to be gathered.    Each character has their own mysterious past to contend with and only by dealing with those pasts can they be the heroes they need to be in order to save the world.    Among the other things I really liked about this series was the way the characters we came to know in the Percy Jackson series (as well as in the Demi-God Files) were integrated into this series. We got to see Annabeth most of all, but also Thalia (who played a much bigger role than initially expected), Chiron, and others. Percy was absent, but his absence was an important part of the story and was felt appropriately, so I wasn't upset about it.    This might be Riordan's best book yet and my final thought coming out of it was: Why is Rick Riordan so awesome?

0439023513|5.0|Finally book 3 has come out! The Hunger Games proved to me that young adult books can't be smart, emotional (without being over the top), and incredibly dark while still being appealing. Catching Fire confirmed it and showed how a talented writer could revisit a plot and have it be very similar but still keep it fresh and exciting. And now book 3 shows how to carry it through to the big, dramatic conclusion.    In case you missed it: The Hunger Games is about a divided society. The Capital rules with an iron thumb and with all the luxuries while it lives off of the districts, which provide supplies and provisions. Each district is responsible for a specific commodity and have far less than they need to live comfortably (much less decently). There used to be thirteen districts, but when thirteenth rebelled, they were supposedly eradicated. There are rumors that they survived, but no one knows for sure. As a result of the rebellion, the hunger games were created. A boy and a girl from each district are selected in a fight to the death that is televised for entertainment.    That's the background, but the heart of the story revolves around Katniss who has been helping support her family since her father was killed in a mining accident. When she ends up in the hunger games, her behavior sparks a rebellion that she never anticipated but now must become the inspiration for.    The final book deals largely with Katniss's struggle to fit into her new role as the Mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion and overcome her guilt over her hunger games partner, Peeta's capture.    This is one of the few books that has ever made me cry (I can count the number on one hand so it is saying something). Everything about the book is compelling, from the characters to the plot. You can relate to the teenage sorrow and indecisiveness as Katniss tries to decide between Peeta and Gail. And though I wish we'd seen more of Prim, you relate to the sisters' relationship too.    One of the most brilliant aspects of this book is the way it targets television and materialism. It's as much a commentary on society as anything else. The use of tv spots for propaganda only adds to the drama.    I'm a sucker for society gone wrong novels and this is one of the best I've read. My biggest concern: what's next for Suzanne?

COMMENTARY<br />2) SHIELD: A- ...Clark begins to reembrace his primary colors thanks to Lois' rival, Cat Grant who arrives at the Daily Planet while she's in Egypt befriending Hawkman -minus the beard, handsome Michael Shanks. DELETED SCENES<br />3) SUPERGIRL: B ...Clark and Kara have a family reunion. Green Arrow reveals his identity not caring that his former love almost got killed protecting him. DELETED SCENES<br />4) HOMECOMING: A++ ...The scenes taking place in the future and the barn scene make this episode one of the very best. However, Oliver's speech was moronic and hypocritical given that he's the one who made the conscious decision to \\"step out of the shadows.\\" FEATURETTE<br />5) ISIS: A ...The last fifteen minutes are DIAMOND-STUDDED GLORIOUS!!<br />6) HARVEST: A ...From start to finish, this episode might have been taken right out of \\"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\" - only much, much sexier and with an edge.<br />7) AMBUSH: A+ ...General Sam Lane played by the superb Michael Ironside arrives for Thanksgiving dinner. His idea for the Vigilante Registration Agency is actually what the Justice League will become in the future when Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman take over its leadership. The difference here is that Darkseid has agitated anti-hero sentiment allowing those who would enforce it to use it as a weapon.<br />8) ABANDONED: A- ...Tess Mercer aka Lutessa Lena Luthor learns about her past. Lois and Clark's parents deliver touching messages through video recordings. DELETED SCENES<br />9) PATRIOT: A- ...Directed by Tom Welling, Aquaman and wife Mera show Clark and Lois the advantage of allowing your best girl to be your best ally. General Slade becomes Deathstroke after a run-in with the Justice League.<br />10) LUTHOR: B+ ...Welling in one of his most electrifying performances both as Kent and Luthor.<br />11) ICARUS: A+ ...Hawkman and Deathstroke's fight scene is the finest choreographed of the series. In the last scene, everyone involved is at their most beautiful - especially Erica Durance who looks like Wonder Woman and Welling who looks like THE Superman.<br />12) COLLATERAL: D+ ...Written by Jordan Hawley -it's hard to believe this is the same person who wrote the masterpiece that is The Rain Scene in last season's \\"Rabid.\\" He ridiculously glorified chloe at everyone's expense and made Lois sound stupid considering that when she bashed the \\"Tea Party\\" she was bashing her own father. The only things worth watching here were Black Canary, the virtual flight scene and Clark and Lois' first and last scenes together. Everything else was trash.<br />13) BEACON: D- ...Perry \\"Bulldog\\" White a she-man hippie? Ha! Yeah, right. With his classic choleric personality, he'd crash a war as an embedded journalist getting the stories first hand and not accepting anyone's spin on a story except his own. Hippies were not rebels. They were lazy, horny, dope-addicted cowards who started the \\"make love not war\\" hypocrisy just to avoid the draft. Notice they didn't have a problem sendingothers to war when they got into power (Bill Clinton, anyone?). They glorify JFK yet they conveniently forget that he's the one who got us involved in the Vietnam War in the first place. Ghandi, MLK Jr., the American revolutionists of the 18th century- they were genuine and admirable rebels. This makes two lousy episodes in a row that Lois is written out of character. She is not an unperceptive insecure feminazi. Lois Lane has been a strong, intelligent, confident, independent yet at her core (like Superman) passionate, loving, iconic gentlewoman for over seven decades so her scene with Martha Kent made no sense at all especially since they've known each other for years and Lois is the reason Martha's even in politics. Their interaction in \\"Hostage\\" was so much more natural. Welling's distraction for his other project really showed in this episode. At least the fan videos were nice. I liked the one sent in by the soldier. Other than that, this wasn't worth the time. DELETED SCENES<br />14) MASQUERADE: B- ...Ah, what a breath of fresh air it was to see MY Lois again after two miserable episodes. And Mr.Kent? Sexy, sexy, SEXY! It was so GOOD to see/hear their classic, hilarious, pure gold banter again! Downside: Episodes 12-15 shaped up to be chloe's Arc of Suck. At least this time, the iconic duo weren't completely sidelined.<br />15) FORTUNE: C ...Bursts of hilarity(courtesy of Emil-Elvis/Tess duet,drunken Clark,Oliver in drag)mixed with the Smallville writers' pathetic and very desperate attempt to cannonize themselves through their creation:chloe sullivan. They had her outright declare herself the \\"king maker\\" in being THE ONE who inspires Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman to greatness? I'd get mad at this if it wasn't so sad and ridiculous. Writers who can't exercise objectivity when the outcome of the story is on the line have no business being producers. Lois/Clark's eventual wedding was a payoff for stomaching all the shams: Lex/lana, chloe and the two cannon characters she had no business messing with. Because of her one ended up dead, the other with a dark mark and away from his destined true love. Seriously, if I were a family member of the creators of \\"the big 3\\" I'd sue them for disrespecting 7 decades of hard work by thousands of artists and craftsmen and the millions of fans who supported them. MUSIC VIDEO<br />16) SCION: D ...Besides giving Lionel a well deserved all around smack-down, there wasn't a point here that piqued interest. His re-introduction in \\"Luthor\\" was tantalizing but it turned out to be a DUD - as did the \\"Lex clone.\\" A couple of scenes were just WRONG on so many levels. Definitely one of the worst stories of the series. It's like they tried to sneak in a pilot for a spin-off but it just fell apart into an unentertaining and somewhat disturbing mess. DELETED SCENES<br />17) KENT: B- ...Where \\"Luthor\\" was better done focusing on the family as a whole, \\"Kent\\" was lopsided in that the focus was the Kent Farm, not the family itself. It also focused too much on the Luthors again.<br />18) BOOSTER: A++ ...EXCELLENCE PERSONIFIED - BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON AND THE SERIES. If this show were to have any kind of spin-off, I'd want it to be just like this. Written by DC Comics executive Geoff Johns and directed by executive producer/star Tom Welling, this is the only episode where only two regular cast members (Welling and Durance) appear. Handsome Eric Martsolf was born to play Booster Gold. Welling ends his Smallville directing career with IMPRESSIVE ECSTATIC SUPERMANLY FLAIR!<br />19) DOMINION: C- ...Cheesy and predictable. The \\"gladiator\\" fight scenes were very funny, though - they looked like skinny spoofs of Conan the barbarian in slow motion. But at least it did (clumsily) move the story along and it was nice to see Callum Blue again albeit, clearly, not his best performance. COMMENTARY<br />20) PROPHECY: B- ...The \\"crazy quilt\\" of the season. Very nice moments sewn into a tapestry of visually richscenes framed in stunning fashion. But, there was much, too, too much jammed into one single episode without proper exploration leaving one dissatisfied. Case in point:Kara's (Laura Vandervoort's) departure. It was an ill-conceived stunt even when DC allowed it in Justice League Unlimited. Perhaps, it was no accident that Season 9 (despite its plotholes)remained the greatest, most tightly executed season in the series' entire ten-year run AND it was also the one and ONLY season when Welling was fully engaged as star/producer the entire year (come season 10, his producing time was cut in half due to his \\"Glee knock-off\\" dramedy). Absent Welling's undivided attention to detail, 10 fell prey to the typical pitfalls of seasons 1-8: strong first half (and 10 did have the strongest ever) followed by a second half full of anti-climactic non-resolutions, strong story lines shamefully rushed, glossed over while weak and Superman-irreleveant arcs were wasted over several episodes.<br />21) (WEDDING)FINALE PART 1: A++ ...The last episode filmed (as Part 2 was filmed third to last). It explains why most of the cast members seemed so genuinely emotional - in the barn, the door scene and then the wedding. They were tenderly staged and photographed - simple, elegant... beautiful.<br />22) (SUPERMAN)FINALE PART 2: A++ ...For once, Ausiello was wrong and they stuck with \\"finale\\" as the official title. Just as well. For me, it confirms that the writers were never interested in telling Superman stories, only in using his fame to promote their show. Welling punked out. He did not wear the suit. The Fortress sequence was thrilling but after that, it was just close-ups of his face and an all CGI caricature. Still, the final 2 and 1/2 minutes were... PERFECT. Or, as perfect as this show ever got.<br /><br />I'll remember it as \\"the Superman show that wasn't about Superman.\\" Thanks to certain elements though, Smallville's decathlon held glimpses of genuine cinematic greatness (if only Welling had the guts to follow completely through). All in all, it was an often interesting (when Clark and his Lois were the focus), at times too far-fetched (superlana and Black Canary-wannabe shortkick chloe) and needlessly melodramatic (lana seasons 3-8, chloe seasons 6-10, oliver season 10 and the stupid clark,lex,lana triangle seasons 5-8) but because of its source origin (and in spite of its  writers/producers), always hopeful decade - not because we want/need to believe in heroes but because there ARE heroes regardless of wether we believe in them or not. And, when these heroes' deeds eventually touch our lives, they inspire us to create new ones and become them ourselves. Writers come and go but Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster's original Superman vision shines as bright as always. 73 years and counting... he still stands for Truth, Justice and the American Way.

Minho's says \\"the leader,\\" Teresa's (according to the sign on the door that they find) is \\"the traitor,\\" and Thomas's says \\"to be killed by Group B.\\" And they have two weeks to get one hundred miles north to the safe haven, through sick and crazy people suffering from the Flare, an illness that turns them into animals (sort of like the Walking Dead really). Can they make it in time? Can Thomas survive? Will Teresa really betray him?    Book two of the trials, instead of answering any questions, only serves to bring up more questions. (Sort of like Lost right?) Thomas slowly gets some of his memories back, but they only serve to make things even more confusing. Is WICKED good, as Teresa first claimed while still in the Glade? Was Thomas really a party to all of it? (My only concern with this book is that once we have all the information, it isn't really going to make sense, but that may only be because I haven't thought of an answer that makes satisfying sense.)    This is the first time I've read a book where I can't really think of where things are going. I can't figure out how or why the different pieces we've been given fit together. I love it. Dashner packs the pages with never-ending excitement and terror. Hunger Games finally has an equal in terms of exciting YA novel. I know it won't be for a while, but I can't wait until book 3, The Death Cure, arrives.
0061537969|2.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was highly recommended to me, and I enjoyed the premise, which quickly drew me in. The conceit as you surely know by now, is that it's the story of a semi-professional racecar driver's struggles with numerous hardships, told from the vantage point of his dog.<br /><br />At first, the dog/narrator's voice is consistent and plausible. Enzo tells us of his feelings of helplessness as his body ages, his longing to be human, his mostly bad memories of the puppy farm he was raised in, and his undying love for his human family. He is poignant, perceptive, and most importantly, plausible. The dog's-eye-view of the world is a wonderful treat, and it amazed me I had never seen it before in the first person in adult fiction. \\"The Call of the Wild,\\" and all the others I can remember, are in the third person.<br /><br />Certainly, there are difficulties with this approach, but Stein handles them well, at least in the beginning. How does Enzo know so much? His master talks to him a lot, and he watches the TV whenever he's not home. We hear Enzo's thoughts in our head and it works. For a little while, at least.<br /><br />The problem is that Stein isn't content to limit the narration to a dog's-eye view, but constantly interrupts it with a voice that I can only imagine is his own. For example, after Enso shares a thought disparaging how pathetic human claws are, not even able to touch the floor, he shifts gears a chapter later, in talking about the special person who does his mistress' nails. Well, which is it? Does Enzo see them as \\"human claws\\" or \\"nails?\\" This seesawing between canine and human viewpoints continues through the rest of the book.<br /><br />Denny, his master, will sometimes take Enzo for spins in a racecar around the track, which Enzo loves. Yes, occasionally we're treated to Enzo's voice describing the thrill of the sensation of speed. But when Enzo shifts to describe becoming one with the car, feeling the vibrations under your hands and feet in the steering wheel and accelerator (as though he knows it firsthand and not through listening to Denny), I can't believe I'm listening to the wise old dog anymore.<br /><br />It only gets more frustrating when Enzo judges certain humans for wearing untidy clothes, or lists his favorite actors in order, or explains the errors in judgment that various drivers made on the track that cost them their lives. It goes beyond this as Enzo muses philosophically on the skills needed to win the race on the track (the art of driving in the rain, for one) and the skills humans need to succeed with their hardships in life. Thanks, anyway, Mr. Stein, but I want to hear Enzo, not you.<br /><br />The story itself is only fair and very predictable; Denny is put through the ringer in a series of tragedies. The main conflict that develops has underdeveloped characters and overdeveloped sentimentality; the villains are little more than props to inflict pain and suffering in Denny's life, and lack plausible motives as much as they lack complete personalities. Be that as it may, Enzo knows way too much about the machinations of behind-the-scenes manipulation and plotting, and it weakens the book terribly.<br /><br />How this could have worked so much better would be to really limit the viewpoint to what Enzo, the devoted and wise servant, could really describe through his experience; his suffering with his master's suffering; not understanding what is going on, but being frustrated by knowing something is terribly amiss in his world; describing the world in smells, tastes, and sounds rather then lofty concepts and philosophical musings.<br /><br />It seems to me a brilliant idea, short-circuited by the writer's impatience with the POV he choose. Despite its moments, it left me wanting to reread far better efforts in this sub-genre, like [[ASIN:0743278909 Jonathan Livingston Seagull]], and [[ASIN:B002RKSZCG The Call of the Wild]].l and accelerator (as though he knows it firsthand and not through listening to Denny), I can't believe I'm listening to the wise old dog anymore.

0439023491|5.0|If you have not read the first book then you shouldn't read this. It will ruin things and this is not a series that you want ruined. (I will say this for you though, while some sequels suck, book two is just as good as book one.)<br /><br />In Catching Fire, Katniss has gotten home, the Victory Tour is about to begin, and Katniss discovers that surviving the Hunger Games was not enough. Gale is upset because of her romance with Peeta, Peeta is upset about Katniss faking the relationship, Haymitch is back to being drunk, new Peacekeepers have come into District 12 and they are much more brutal, and Katniss has an unwanted visitor...the President.<br /><br />This isn't the worst to come of course. It's the Quarter Quell-every 25 years the Games take a special twist (one year they doubled the number of tributes for example). This year is no exception and the twist may be the worst of all because the President doesn't believe that Katniss really suggested suicide because she loved Peeta. Her action has triggered tensions that have remained under the surface for years and if she doesn't diffuse the situation things there could be an all-out rebellion. Which would most likely lead to the death of Katniss's family and friends.<br /><br />I've found often that where the first book in a highly imaginative, dystopian series is incredible, the next books in the series don't hold up. No such issues here. Collins keeps the characters rich, the plot complex, and the entire book full of surprises and excitement.<br /><br />At moments it feels like things happen too quickly in the book. Entire weeks zoom by in a matter of pages and it isn't always clear that they've passed until afterward, but while I'm certainly curious about the events of the time spans that we skip, I understand why Collins did it. It would be slow down the book and get somewhat repetitive. This way things stay quick and exciting.<br /><br />This might be one of the best series I read and I can't wait until book three comes out. Things are about to change, yet again.three comes out. Things are about to change, yet again.
B004HO6HYI|3.0|To tell you the truth the movie isn't as good if you haven't read the book. Or so I've been told. If it's a book based movie I usually read the books before the movies but I was already engrossed in so many other novels that I had no time to read it and I really wish I had made time.<br /><br />I think I get the whole premise of the story. There from a different planet so I guess they can be considered aliens. There was ten of them but theres only seven left now. They kill them in order and number four is next. And each has a diffrent gift but fours is the most powerful.Check I got it. Oh I almost forgot they have guardians to help protect them and they need to be kept in secret. Like most people with superpowers.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie is awful. It was so bad it looked low budget. It wasn't just in the begining throughout the movie you could clearly see that the budget was low in those places.<br /><br />You know how number four has the blue flash? Well every time he flashed it, it reminded me of Liz from Hellboy when her fire was blue. She couldn't control it it either. Maybe I think fire is still cooler than a giant blue flashlight getting thrown at you.<br /><br />The romance. I expected a lot but got hardly any. Honestly I don't understand what he saw in her? She sat alone at lunch and took pictures of people without them knowing and posting them on the web. That seemed creepy to me. Her character should have been more fleshed out. But because we didn't get to know a lot about her.<br /><br />Next the nerdy friend who gets picked one, thrown around,and having a pranks coming out of his locker. The main character helps him and wow the main character and him somehow become friends how ironic. It's cliche at best.<br /><br />We meet number six. And I can say is that she really made me engrossed in the movie. Her character screemed badass and then she had that country accent. Her scenes were enjoyable.<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the action and that doesn't really start steaming up until the last twenty five minutes of the movie. And let me tell you, I'm not big on the whole action movies but I liked the action. I had to pee during the movie but I wouldn't miss it for anything that's how good it was.<br /><br />Now the ending you can clearly see it's going to be a sequel. I didn't even none the movie was over until the credits starting rolling and I still was confused. Because nothing really happend. The whole ending was very unclean.he last twenty five minutes of the movie. And let me tell you, I'm not big on the whole action movies but I liked the action.

0547258305|4.0|Gracelings are people with exceptional skills. Where the average person can run fast, a Graceling with the gift of running can run like Flash. Where a regular person can be a very good cook, a Graceling with the gift of cooking can make even better food. But for all their amazing abilities, Gracelings are feared. They are property of the king of the kingdom they are born to. Katsa is one such Graceling, the king's niece, able to kill with her bare hands since she was a child. She had been the king's private assassin for many years. But when she meets another Graceling from another kingdom, she has no idea how much her life will change. She is forced to examine everything she's ever believed about her abilities and where her place in the world is meant to be.    This is a strange series, since it doesn't follow the conventions of a typical book. It's almost like a TV show, where you're watching a bunch of episodes back to back. They have some underlining threads running from one section to the next, but for the most part, they have their own stories that are more or less resolved before moving on to the next one. It's not a good or bad thing, only an unusual one. (Somewhat similar to the way the Alanna series by Tamora Pierce works.)    The reason this works, is because Cashore manages to make Katsa a multi-dimensional character. Her emotions feel very real and you can relate to her every thought and confusion. While the plot seems to change, we have Katsa to hold on to and care about throughout.    Not all of the characters are as well-rounded. Bitterblue, who becomes important in the second half or so of the book, is one of the least developed characters. She's sympathetic and sweet, even stronger than the average child, but little more. (This is all right, especially since she is getting her own book soon so we will undoubtedly learn more about her then.)    The place I find the story most lacking is in the structure of the world itself. There are seven kingdoms,each ruled by a different king, that are close enough that their politics and commerce are closely connected. But the truth is we don't get enough of a look into the seven different kingdoms. Why do we need so many? I would have preferred fewer, say four, that we could get to know more intimately than a larger number where we only got bits and pieces of each. Even the important ones didn't feel fully developed. We spend a large portion of time in Monsea but I don't feel like I know anything about the place (aside from the king itself).    The love story, though predictable for the most part, is still well done. You still feel a deep connection to Po and Katsa that you don't always feel with other fantasy couples.    It's a solid book, not a top ten, but definitely on the positive list.
B004NDJXOO|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Michael J. Fox was burning white hot in 1985.  His first American TV show \\"Family Ties\\" was on top of the ratings, the first \\"Back to the Future\\" movie was an instant classic, and he even made this B movie an enduring hit.<br /><br />\\"Teen Wolf\\" tells the improbable story of Scott Howard's struggles with high school, basketball, and a semi-generational wolf curse in his family.  It all works because Mr. Fox plays it with as much believability as possible, and the script has a surprising amount of heart, and relative credibility.  Though the movie highlights colorful suppporting characters, it is unquestionably Michael J. Fox who holds the whole enterprise together with a talented performance.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing how the movie makes the transition to Blu-Ray Disc, and am glad its being converted to the high definition format.<br /><br />Also featuring character actors James Hampton and Mark Holton(\\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure, \\"A League Of Their Own,\\") \\"Teen Wolf\\" is great.
1416955070|4.0|When Clary goes to a club with her best friend, she witnesses three strangely marked teens murder another teen whose body then disappears without anyone touching it. They are Shadowhunters and the teen they killed is actually a demon. They fight to rid the earth of demons but it is a difficult battle and not all Shadowhunters feel the same way about who should and shouldn't be left alone of the supernatural folk. When her mother disappears, Clary learns that there is a good deal about herself and her mother that she never knew. And she is more connected to the world of Shadowhunters and demons than she ever knew.    There is something about this series that reminds me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I mean the Buffy of season one who had just found out she could not just be a normal teen but had to fight vampires. The Buffy who fell in love with someone dangerous (Angel) who had secrets that would play an important role in her future. While I don't find Clary as endearing as Buffy, she was still the perfect person to be the center of the story. As the newbie to the dark world, she is the perfect window to let us, the readers, learn how the world works.    There are a lot of complaints about the book and though I agree that this isn't the most unique of stories, I didn't find it to be as weak as some people say. It's fun and full of dramatic teen angst and a slightly icky realization at the end that is anything but surprising to everyone but the actually characters. (It hold true with my general rule: if you don't actually see people die or completely see the body, they are not dead! And even then sometimes not.)    The characters could use more development, but then, it's a trilogy, so you can't reveal everything all at once. I hope we get more on Isabelle because right now she's sort of just \\"there\\" which is never appealing for a character. Perhaps the best character in the book is Luke who is much more complex than you can initially guess.    In the end, I will pickup books two and three. They won't be the best books I've ever read but they are fun, quick reads and I'm curious to know what is going to happen. There is news that they will be turning this into a movie, which makes me wonder if it would be better or worse off for that. I could actually see this making a good TV show.
B0007TKNII|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />This 2004 film of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is extremely solid.  With a good cast including Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Minnie Driver it is very well-done.<br /><br />The one major criticism I have is that Mr. Butler's operatic voice is barely serviceable, and hardly up to the Michael Crawford standard.  This is especially noticeable in the classic title song.  Emmy Rossum fares much better as Christine, the Phantom's obsession.  Delays cost the musical's original cast from doing this movie and are no doubt partially responsible for the movie's being a pale, though still game companion to Broadway stagings even without the original cast.  Ms. Rossum's soprano is true and vibrant.  Minnie Driver is a scene stealer as Carlotta, the Paris Opera House diva.<br /><br />This is still a very nice film representation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical.
1423113381|5.0|You don't even realize you're missing something in Percy Jackson until you read this book and discover how much better it was. Don't get my wrong, Percy Jackson was excellent, but in his newest series we got an even deeper connection and depth to the depth.    Sadie and Carter are siblings. You wouldn't know it though. Not only have they not grown up together but Carter takes after their father (who is black) and Sadie takes after their mother (who is white). Sadie has a British accent from growing up with her grandparents in England while Carter sounds American (he's grown up backpacking around the world with his dad). They aren't very close because they don't know each other very well, but all that changes.    Their mother's death happened under mysterious circumstances and their father has been keeping secrets from them. And when he blows up the Rosetta Stone, everything changes. For one thing, he releases five Egyptian gods, including Set who intends to destroy the world. They discover a royal heritage, magic abilities, and how to host Gods.    As always, Riordan manages to mix mythology and reality to create a seamless story. There's so much going on, but he manages to keep the it all straight, make all the details add up, and leave you guessing.    Best of all, Riordan really delves into Sadie and Carter's minds. You feel like you know them, understand their fears and sorrows, you relate to each one for different things. Like Percy, these kids have a difficult relationship with their parents, but unlike Percy, the relationship feels complex. You are as torn as they are about how they should relate to their parents. Should Sadie be furious with her father for not raising her? Should Carter be furious for never growing up with friends and a home? Can they learn to relate to each other?    To my delight, this book is even longer than the Percy series, giving you even more time to enjoy it.    Also like Percy, you get a sense of something much bigger happening than what you see. And that mystery only adds to the excitement. The story has more intricate detail than Percy, but it is just as comprehensive.    Ultimately, you come away feeling satisfied with what you've read and excited to continue on the journey and see where it takes you.
B002ZG976U|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie -- we rarely see a movie more than once, but we saw this one three times,and can't wait for the DVD to come out.  I knew very little about Christina Aguilera, but I'm a fan now.  She really has talent, and gets to showcase it here.  To me, this movie is a cross between \\"Cabaret\\" and \\"Chicago\\" without the Nazis or gunfire.  It's a joyous, sexy, fun romp with great dancing and singing.  Cher is perfectly cast as the maturing diva who keeps the girls in line, but also mothers them.  She shows why she's a star in her two diva numbers.  Stanley Tucci is at his best here, playing a gay foil to Cher's lead.  I'm so irritated that the jaded critics, who only seem to enjoy blood and violence, couldn't appreciate this.  So many of my friends didn't want to see it until we told them how great it is --- and all because the critics don't seem to like anything that has joy in it.  See it, it's a romantic evening, and you'll leave the theater wanting to go back and watch it all over again.  There's a well-deserved note of thanks in the credits to Swarovsky crystals -- and one of Christina's costumes consists entirely of strings of pearls.  Gorgeous!
0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen has been taking care of her family ever since her father was killed-before her eyes-by a mine. She, along with her friend Gale, has been illegally sneaking out of her District and into the woods to hunt and bring back the meat necessary for their survival. She does this most of all because of her love for Prim, her younger sister. The day of the Reaping arrives as it does each year, when two children from each District are chosen to fight to the death while being televised to the entire population. Against all odds, Prim is chosen and Katniss knows that she has to protect her sister once again-by taking her place. Coming from District 12, the coal-mining district, Katniss has little chance of winning. District 12 has only won once. But maybe, with a little luck and a surprise alliance Katniss has a shot. If she can get herself to kill her competitors. Especially if she might love one of them.    Collins does an incredible job of weaving this dystopian world where things are run by the Capitol for the best of and the amusement of the Capitol. The one thing the Capitol can be counted on doing is finding ways to remind the Districts that they must obey. Or else.    The characters are so real and sympathetic that it's hard not to cry at the moment when Prim's name is reaped. You feel very keenly Katniss's desperation, confusion, and anger at the things that have befallen her family.    The story is written in first person present, which really threw me at first, since it's so rare. It took me a while to get used to it and in the beginning I thought I really disliked it. But once I got used to it, I didn't notice it anymore and it made the rest of the story feel closer and more resounding. I will definitely be picking up Catching Fire as soon as I can get my hands on it (which will likely be after work today). I can't wait to see what happens next and how Katniss takes to her life after everything.

0307454541|3.0|My sister is absolutely obsessed with this series (as is much of America, as one book or another from the series has been on the bestseller list forever now). My stepmom hated it. My dad said it takes about 250 pages before it's any good but the rest is great. So naturally, I had to see for myself. Conclusion: I agree with my dad, it takes about half the book before it gets interesting.<br /><br />My initial reaction: how did this ever get published? I'm surprised that any manuscript reader ever read beyond the first couple chapters in order to get to the good stuff. Even more surprising is that readers enjoyed it enough to read that far into it and that it managed to garner the enthusiasm needed to make it the success it is. Had I not been reassured by my sister and had it not been one of those books that I feel like I'd be missing out on important pop culture (and my desire to get what the big deal is) I would not have read beyond chapter one.<br /><br />Much of Larsson's writing seems to show poor writing ability. There's a lot of passive \\"filling in\\" to be endured before the story finally starts. The most interesting and title character doesn't really play any part in the story until nearly halfway in. The passage of time is so detailed that it made me want to rip the pages out. (At 7:00 he walked to the shop and ate a bagel with a cup of coffee. At 8:00 he walked back home to read his newspaper. At 9:30 he turned on his computer and began typing...) The final twist wasn't as surprising as it might have been, but that can be forgiven at least. My dad thinks the biggest issue is that Blomkvist is the dullest character on the planet and seems less appealing than the many women attracted to him find him. Remember how the end of the Lord of the Rings movie dragged on for an extra thirty minutes? So did this book. There are also so many characters in the Vanger family that it is nearly impossible to keep track of them all.<br /><br />There are plus sides of course. Lisbeth is an interesting character and the moment she becomes more prominent the story picks up. Even Berger is more interesting. While I could have liked a smaller amount of family members, the family drama was interesting and even compelling at times.<br /><br />I know there are more negatives than positives listed, but the second half really did make up for the first and I will be reading book 2, which I hear is infinitely better.<br /><br />Random note: it's so funny how clear it is to see when this is written, because of the line \\"After discussions with her mother, they had agreed to give Pernilla an iPod, an MP3 player hardly bigger than a matchbox...\\" Presumably they're talking about the iPod mini, since the original iPods were certainly not that small, but the fact that he needed to explain what an iPod was just goes to show you how new they were to the market. He died in 2004 with all three books in the trilogy complete, so it must have been written some time in the early 2000s.<br /><br />It is interesting how the book was titled Men Who Hate Women in Sweden, since while that's clearly part of the book, I wouldn't say it's THE book.

B001NLKT60|4.0|could not put it down - read his first book thought it was a nail biter, didn't think his second book would stand up to the 1st, boy, was I wrong, this one I cannot put down, very well written and keeps the reader in suspense, do not know what comes next - cannot wait to finish this one so I can get to his last book - too bad that he did not live long enough to see the success and to finish all 6 as planned
B000TU16GS|3.0|Finally, a plausible (at least semi-plausible) explanation as to why a child might be a secret agent. Plus a believable explanation as to why he's got some skills-Alex Rider has been raised by his uncle who, unbeknown to Alex, worked as a spy and has been training Alex as a spy for years. When his uncle is killed, Alex is recruited to finish his Uncle's mission. Specifically, to infiltrate a company led by Herod Sayle. Sayle is donating thousands of computers to schools all around the world but something doesn't seem right about it and the government needs to know what. It becomes Alex's job to find out if there is anything deeper going on (which of course there is).    While I was pleased to find a story that I believed in, I didn't love this book. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't great. Alex isn't a particularly dynamic character. Presumably his parent's early death will play into the larger series but that is hard to say for sure as there was no hint of it in this book. I didn't connect to Alex either. The most I know about his character is he is curious and determined. That's not much to go on.    It also felt like everything was sort of done for him. Alex managed such a good job largely because his uncle had done it all before. I would assume that in other books this will not be the case, but here at least, it was just him managing to escape where his uncle did not and only because too many bad guys think slow painful deaths are better than quick ones. Ok, that's a little unfair. Alex did have skills and he did use them to save himself, but it just wasn't enough for me.    I think the biggest problem for me was that there weren't any other characters for Alex to really interact with and play off of. There was no friend working alongside him or even a crush. Anyone who was around was only there for short spans of time while 95% of it was with him by himself.    Clearly other people like this book, since it's already got 8 books in the series. I have enough other books to check out that this one falls to the bottom of my list (if it makes the list at all).

1439177783|5.0|I haven't read a memoir in a while, but something about this book caught my attention. Maybe it's just that I've always liked Portia de Rossi (and by always I mean she was great in Better Off Ted and also enjoyable in Arrested Development-I didn't watch Ally Mcbeal so I can't comment on that one). I've always wondered how anyone could be anorexic (don't they get hungry!?!?) so having a chance to read de Rossi's account of her eating disorder (which involved both anorexia and binging and purging) was a welcome opportunity.    De Rossi begins her story around age twelve when she starts working as a model. It's fascinating how internal her struggle was. In many ways, it was as much if not more so her own pushing that led to her extreme body image issues. Her mother didn't help and seemed to be more negligent than actually pushy in the matter. Shortly after passing out on a movie set, she went from 82 pounds to 168 in a short span of time.    For the first time I had an idea of how someone could become anorexic and live that way (the answer is yes, they do get hungry). Portia de Rossi holds nothing back. I found myself unable to stop reading. (Only the very end got a little slow, when she was summing up what she had learned and how she resolved things, but even that was interesting because she talked about meeting Ellen and their relationship together.)    This book is a really intense but extremely fascinating look at the pressures of Hollywood, body image, and homophobia. It's definitely a book worth reading if you're interested in any of these topics.
B00428CPUY|4.0|There are many great performances on display here.  Many established artists who appear to have drunken from the fountain of youth.  Yet, in the middle of all this talent, is a young musician named Gary Clark, Jr. who only performed one song but was absolutely amazing.  His performance of Bright Lights alone is worth seeing.  I had not heard of him before and hope to see his talent better recognized in the future.  All in all, the whole show is a worthwhile viewing adventure.
006112429X|5.0|This book is one of those eerie, hard to forget books. We Need To Talk About Kevin tells the story of Kevin Katchadorian, a teenage boy who goes to school one day and kills a number of his schoolmates. In the world of school shootings, this not an unrealistic story.    Written from the perspective of Eva, Kevin's mother, in the form of letters to her estranged husband. Eva tries to come to terms with everything that happened. Was it her fault? Was it Kevin's upbringing and her relationship with him lead him to become a killer? Was it something in Kevin's personality? All the questions that you can't help but wonder about when you hear about a school massacre.    I found myself equally appalled and fascinated by Kevin, Eva, and Franklin (the father) throughout the book. And I was pleased to find myself surprised at the end of the book.    One of the most fascinating things about this story is that the story is written from the parent's perspective. Parents seem to get ignored when talk of school shooters arises. They are blamed for what happened and no one thinks about the fact that the parents' lives have just been shattered. They've just lost a child (even if not literally), people view them with horror and despise, and they can't grieve in the open. And what do they do if their child ends up in jail for their actions? Support them? Shun them? Can they stay where they are or do they have to move?    While I'm not normally a huge fan of books written in letter or diary format, the book was done in a way that did not make it feel cumbersome. The narrative flows despite the letter style and the story is engrossing. And disturbing. There may not be a resolution to the nature vs nurture question of whose fault everything is, but We Need To Talk About Kevin leaves you with a lot to think about.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|Read the title. That is the question throughout the entire book. The author, readers, and characters all think that one sentence over and over. I read this book and loved the plot. I wished this was written in first person though. The chacters were shallow, amd the &#34;scary&#34; maze was really no threat at all.    I would like the book if it was written by a different person. One who didnt make up stupid words like clunck and shank.    Over all the ending was predictable. Im not going to tell you it, but you will probably be able to tell in the first 20 pages how the book ends.    I am 11 so you probably wont think much of the review, but this book (as James Dashner would put it) is shank. Its not worth buying.
B004LQ0ELO|3.0|I was waiting for this book to come out in paperback before buying because I hate carrying around enormous books (particularly in hardcover, which makes them heavier) but my cousin happened to have a copy to lend me, so I got the treat of reading this earlier than planned. I remember when Da Vinci Code was being passed around (I was spending a year in Israel so the ten or so books that we had among everyone at school were passed around and read by absolutely everyone). Everyone was absolutely fascinated by this alternate way of looking at these historical, famous images, places, and people that Brown presented. (While it is true that Angels and Demons came first, for some reason no one seemed to realize book 1 existed until after book 2 was popular) and in The Lost Symbol, the mysteries and surprises keep on coming.    Robert Langdon is lured to the Capitol, ostensibly to give a last minute lecture, only to discover that he has been tricked and the man who supposedly asked him to come has been kidnapped. The kidnapper wants Langdon to decode an ancient pyramid that will lead to the Ancient Mysteries, a secret guarded carefully by the Masons (a society with secrets NOT a secret society). Like in the other books, you never really knew where things were going to wind up. Who was good or bad, what was the end goal, what didn't we know about history?    I had a number of issues with The Lost Symbol, the least of which is Brown's a flare for the dramatics that has a slight tendency to go overkill. (Nearly every section ends with something like \\"The rag was slipping back in her throat, threatening to choke her. She couldn't breath!\\" Yes well, A->B->C.) This book got a little too spiritual for me and while I don't necessarily disbelieve the idea that thoughts can impact reality, the things being claimed in the books just felt too out there. It was all too much and it required so much explaining (the noetic science and the actual symbology) that though the plot depends on it, the amount of explanation came off as a bit over the top and slowed the plot down a bit. Because each book is so detailed and complex, it is nearly impossible to actually recall details from one to the next, so even when Brown uses the typical writing tactic of mention small bits and memories of previous books to allow the readers to feel the connection (and also enjoy the nostalgia of recalling the other books), I found myself unable to actually recall the things he was mentioning.    The weakest part of the book to me was the ending, which was too long and dragged out. After everything was resolved and calm again, the book wasn't over. Not only was it not over, it had quite a bit left. It didn't feel like we were going anywhere.    The thing that I would most appreciate, is actual colored pictures of the art pieces mentioned, because otherwise, they are asking us to take Dan Brown's word for everything (or look it all up-which we know most people won't do). Adding pictures (much like it adds some of the other elements) would make it feel even more real.    Despite all the problems I had with this book, I did enjoy it. There were enough twists and turns and bits of intrigue to keep me interested and I found myself particularly enjoying Katherine Solomon's character. It was a good read but certainly not the best in the series.

0545265355|5.0|I LOVED the Hunger Games series. it is the first book series in a long time that I literally could not put down. In my opinion, the best one in the series is Mocking Jay. Which, although it breaks many rules of literature (namely not making your character unconscious through most of the book), is filled with more tragedy and incites into human nature than just about any book I have ever read, and remains one of, if not, my favorite books ever. If you want your kids reading (or even if you enjoy young adult literature your self...trust me, there's no shame in that.)Buy this series.

B002ZG980U|2.0|Watching INCEPTION very carefully and keeping track of the intertwined dreams and plot devices, I must express great respect for the obvious work that went into putting this film together.<br /><br />It is also an interesting concept on the idea of Dream Worlds -vs- Real Worlds.<br /><br />For example, if you went to sleep tonight but never woke up,  wouldn't that dream world you lived in become your real universe ?<br /><br />I confess, I have had some dream worlds that I have visited that I would not mind staying in and never waking up.<br /><br />Having said all that and giving much respect to the makers of this film for hard work and a genuine effort, I have to say as a movie, INCEPTION is painful to watch.<br /><br />Some movies really pull you in and make you care for what happens the the characters.<br />At their best, you may even briefly for a few moments forget you are watching a movie.<br /><br />This never happened with INCEPTION.<br />I always felt I was watching a movie with a whole crew and director sitting behind every scene.<br />I cared nothing about the characters.<br />I cared nothing for their assignment.<br /><br />For me, it was eye candy and no substance.<br /><br />I know it was a big success, but for me it was totally forgettable as a movie.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|At first i really liked this head set. It felt great got good sound and had a great mic. Then about 8 months into it the right head phone snapped were it turns to fit around your neck. I know what your thinking, I dropped it or bent it the wrong way... Well funny story,it was on my head and snapped mid game! so I was mad of coarse and duct taped it back in place when the volume-chat-bass box started shorting out! now the right head phone hangs off my head and if the wire is not sitting perfectly I only get half the sound. Its like it was on a 8 month breaking timer. DO NOT BUY if you want a gaming head set get a cheap one because its going to break anyway. Very cheap... Not worth it

B003Q6D1YW|5.0|My jaw dropped when I saw this wonderful documentary only has a 3 star (average) review; I thought it was one of the most fascinating things I've seen in a long time. The road trip/dating/self-examination aspects of it brought to mind the classic dateumentary \\"Sherman's March,\\" albeit updated for the internet era and with a very different twist. It would have been an interesting story regardless, but what elevated it into the realm of art for me was the incredibly sensitive and compassionate way that the young filmmakers handled the unexpected events that arose(doing my best to avoid spoilers). Parts of the film are hilarious; I had tears streaming down my face at one point where Nev reads a bunch of provocative text messages aloud, and at the same time there are aspects that make a bleakly poignant statement about the broken dreams and harsh realities faced by middle class Americans. While the film also serves as a cautionary tale about the facebook, texting, and other digital communication, ultimately the internet in this case is just a modality that exposes tragic flaws in the human psyche.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|I didn't know this was a vampire movie until I read some of the reviews, however, just to let you know that this movie is spoken in another language so I wasn't sure if I could watched it through the whole thing with the english subtile, but with the excellent acting from the two young actors and with a very touching/sad storyline, it really captivated me until the end. I would recommand this movie to anyone to watch it. By the way, I did not purchase this movie, I watched it directly from amazon stream live video's, for free!
B001V9LRTM|2.0|I really wanted to like the movie ... I love the music, and the cameramen did an incredible job under extremely difficult conditions.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />We have to view it for what it's supposed to be.  As a documentary, it fails horribly.<br /><br />There's no attempt to tell us when things are happening, nor the environment during the happening.  For example, in the closing performance (Jimi Hendrix), we get absolutely no idea: is there anyone there to listen?  It would have been easy to put a date/time stamp at the start of each song, to allow us to place it into context ... and a shot of the crowd at the time would have been wonderful.<br /><br />The movie shows us a handful of performers, about 17 ... of the 32 or so that actually performed.  What happened to the other half?  We're not told ... they apparently don't exist.<br /><br />The choice of songs included for those performers is often, well, odd.  A number of times I was left wondering \\"was there a problem obtaining music rights for the better known / more popular songs\\"?<br /><br />Even the included footage is odd ... consider Jimi Hendrix, the greatest guitar player ever ... did we need prolonged close-up shots of his nose instead of his @#$%^&* hands on the guitar?<br /><br />The overwhelming majority of the film is straight-forward camera shots ... except for a few cases where the editor/director said \\"hey, let's use a cheesy effect\\" (which provided no benefits).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer has no apparent added resolution or framing, leaving the customer to wonder what the benefit was.<br /><br />If you want this for the music, I recommend other albums.  If you want it for a view into the history, I wish I had a recommendation.<br /><br />My wish: to be put in an editing room with a the raw film footage, some editing software/hardware and someone who can use it, and some time.<br /><br />Check out: [...] for a list of who performed, and where you can find which performances on various CDs and videos.CDs and videos.

B00005M91K|5.0|As a film with no words, no characters, and no plot, Baraka (\\"blessing\\" in Sufi) can be a bit tough to explain to people. It is not a movie, nor a documentary exactly. It is more of a visual and emotional adventure all over the world that will make you re-examine your place in it. More than a glorified screensaver of beautiful nature scenes, the film includes everything from majestic landscapes to religious rituals to jarring scenes of city life. It is partly a commentary on consumption and pantheism, though it is also very open to the viewer's interpretation. Director Ron Fricke filmed the collage of video vignettes at over 150 locations in 24 countries and captured every stunning image in high fidelity 70mm. This is an amazing example of cinematography and a great conversation piece.

B003UESJH4|4.0|Tonight is the ceremony of the 83rd Academy Awards, which signals the official end of the 2010 movie year, and it has taken me a while to find an opportunity to see the Best Picture and Best Actor frontrunner, director Tom Hooper's (HBO's [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams]]) intimate chamber-piece historical drama about how King George VI overcame a debilitating stutter and went on to lead the British empire through World War II. Written by Tom Seidler (his last big-screen credits were a couple of animated films in the late 90's), it is exactly the type of movie that the Academy praises with their accolades, and in this case, it appears justified for a number of elements, chief of which is Colin Firth's masterful portrayal of the painfully shy former monarch thrown into the spotlight by his older brother who could not give up the twice-divorced woman he loved.<br /><br />George VI was known as Bertie to his intimates, and despite his royal lineage, he had no intention of assuming the throne. However, he had to speak in public periodically as part of his duties and stammered hopelessly as is illustrated in the film's opening scene when as Prince Albert, the Duke of York, he chokes and stutters uncontrollably at the close of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition in front of thousands at Wembley Stadium. It's one of several traumatizing experiences for Bertie, but his fair-minded wife Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother, recognizes that her husband needs to overcome the situation to serve the empire. She enlists the help of Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist (and failed actor) based in London, whose unorthodox methods include encouraging his clients to sing, spit out profanities, and share intimate childhood secrets that may unlock the cause of their speech impediments.<br /><br />More familiar historical events take over in the film. When his father, George V, dies in 1936, his brother David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII, but for years, he has been smitten with Wallis Simpson, an American divorc&eacute;e socialite, whom he wants to marry despite the fact that she would never be accepted as the Queen. This constitutional crisis causes Edward VIII to abdicate and thus force Bertie to take the throne. This chain of events causes rifts among the main male characters that are healed by the onset of a world war. Throughout this period, Bertie and Lionel privately work together in painstaking fashion to overcome the new king's stammering. The climax is the 1939 radio speech that George VI needs to deliver to his subjects upon declaration of war against Germany to motivate them to keep their spirits high during the empire's darkest hour.<br /><br />It's not that Firth does anything all that different here as Bertie from his previous work like last year's [[ASIN:B002VECLVO A Single Man]], but his dexterous performance resonates in the way he can be forbiddingly regal and tenderly vulnerable nearly in the same moment. Geoffrey Rush has a field day playing Logue as he gets to represent the audience point of view with his character's acerbic observations and modestly respectable family life. After showy turns in her partner Tim Burton's films ([[ASIN:B0013D8LOK Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]], [[ASIN:B001HN694K Alice in Wonderland]]), Helena Bonham Carter is comparatively demure as Elizabeth, but her innately steely resolve shines through in a flattering portrayal of the woman who would become the most beloved royal in her later years. The trio of actors makes for a particularly effective dynamic among real-life characters and highly personal situations.<br /><br />Smaller roles are filled expertly if sometimes a bit broadly - Guy Pearce playing David as a superficial, nasally fop not above ridiculing his brother's stammering; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury highly suspicious of Logue's intentions; Michael Gambon appropriately distant as the dying king; and Timothy Spall who does a somewhat ham-fistedturn in what appears to be a caricature of Winston Churchill. Claire Bloom was virtually unrecognizable in a near-bit role as Queen Mary. Careful craftsmanship abound in this production from Danny Cohen's subtle cinematography to Eve Stewart's stately production design to Alexandre Desplat's stately soundtrack, which includes a most effective use of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony during the final scene.re of Winston Churchill.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Reading through the free preview of this book on Kindle was enough to prompt me to buy the whole thing. The story was very engaging at first, and I liked the author's not-so-subtle reference to Anne Rice's vampires, especially Lestat, when she referred to \\"that noisy group of troublesome vampires in the Garden District of New Orleans.\\" My disappointment in this book was twofold: first, it seemed to be a book about vampires, not witches and, secondly, the book's main character, Diana, lets herself be thoroughly dominated by the vampire Matthew. There were so many instances of dominant patriarchy, where the witch let herself be subjugated to the will of the vampire, that I began to be a little turned off. Where was this 'discovery of witches' the book's title promised? Yes, Diana was discovering herself as a witch, but it seemed like every discovery she made was quickly quelled or repressed by Matthew. In every instance where vampires and witches met, it was always Matthew the vampire who had to have control. There were at least two instances where he actually uttered the words \\"you must do as I command.\\" Yuck. I kept waiting for him to get his comeuppance as Diana discovered her true power but it seemed like she was more and more willing to just say \\"yes dear, Daddy knows best.\\"

B003UESJFG|4.0|Seriously, this film was not bad, but it didn't quite make the \\"great\\" category, either. It is the story of a supervillain, Megamind, who, finally, defeats his nemesis. This one had a lot of potential, setting up the supervillain-superhero epic conflict well, in a humorous manner (funny, at least, in a culture that has suffered through countless superhero stories, few of which have ever been worthy of a second glance)...and then...well, then what? Outrageous can be good, and worked to carry the beginning of the movie...but there has to be more...outrageous has to morph into genuinely funny, and not just because it plays outlandishly off of something that the audience is already familiar with, at some point. Megamind didn't really do this. Certainly, there were a few funny jokes (feeling mulonKULy, anyone?), but it relied too much on \\"see how crazy this is?\\" and too little on actual puns. Also, very little time was allotted to showing us how Megamind actually became bored with his victory (one of the pivotal pieces of the story)...one minute, he's victoriously looting the city, destroying fire trucks, and whatnot...and the next he's having a heart-to-heart with a plastic desk toy. Uhhh, did I miss something there?<br /><br />All of that said, there were moments that were better than others...like, the way the new villain figures out that he's battling Megamind during the final fight scene...and, the film is visually appealing, so kids will no doubt find it fascinating. If you're looking for something mildly amusing in the superhero/supervillain genre, this film will not waste your time. It's not quite on the same level of \\"Despicable Me\\", but it's heads and shoulders above \\"The Incredibles\\". 3.5/5 stars

This case is just the right size for my camera. The inside of the case has slots for two memory cards, which I doubt I'll ever use. The strap has a Velcro hook, which allows you to switch between carrying options, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />While I find the case a little on the expensive side, it is a really cool case, and considering that price of the camera I'm trying to keep safe, It's worth spending a little more now so you don't have to regret a broken $300 camcorder over trying to save $10 to get a cheaper case!
B003UHYSDK|5.0|I love this album.  I loved their previous album after hearing a track on KEXP and picking it up.  The songs are much more to the point on this album but I like the vocal dualities much more.  Maybe next time they can bring back some of the psych-prog elements but on Wilderness Heart it really isn't missed.  While many reviews have stated Sabbath and Zeppelin as obvious influences, I also hear Jefferson Airplane, Heart, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd and Tom Petty.  These influences don't really prepare you for the modern visceral approach that their sound reaches.  It's raw and produced very cleanly at the same time.  The songs are loose and warm but also dark and foreboding, reminding you that the apocalypse is just around the corner.  The vocals harmonies are enchanting and dangerous like sirens calling you to your doom.  This record is beautiful and I wish I had written/produced it.

0486476421|5.0|Harder read because its an old book but if you adapt to this way of thinking you can achieve anything.
0711986746|3.0|Like many Queen and biography-in-general fans, I was anxious to find a decent, well-informed biography of Freddie Mercury - a bio that would tell the truth in a tactful way, while not exploiting the man.  I bought Peter Freestone's book, not because I expected it to be top notch, but because I figured it was probably the best that was out there.  My conclusion?  It was just ok.  That being said, I still feel it is (to date) probably the best Freddie bio that is available.  Here are what I feel are the pros and cons of the book, staring with the pros...    Pros -- Freestone knew Freddie personally for twelve years (from 1979 until his death in 1991), and as his personal assistant, practically lived in his pocket during that time being present for professional moments as well as personal ones.  It is more than evident that Freestone really cared for Freddie - loved him even -- and that love comes through in the recounting of their years together.  The book provides several very entertaining anecdotes about Freddie - ones that give a glimpse into the real man.  Freestone provides a fair view of Freddie and isn't afraid to outline Mercury's flaws as well as his good traits.  The story is told with much humor - something I think Freddie would have appreciated.    Cons - the book jumps from one story to another with no rhyme or reason.  Often the recounting of one story is not yet finished when Freestone jumps to a totally different subject (a different topic, a different year, a different geographical region, a different issue altogether), either never returning to the original story or returning to it about 10 pages later after you've forgotten the first bit.  This is frustrating and happens throughout the book.  A writer he is not as the book feels extremely disjointed.  While there are some entertaining anecdotes, Freestone spends a great amount of time detailing subjects which for me, just weren't that interesting.  For example, he spends pages and pages rehashing details of every single video Queen ever made.  And when I say rehashing details, I am talking about details that any Queen fan already knows, such as the video concept, the costumes, the video's set, the makeup band members were wearing, the song lyrics, the special effects, etc.  Granted, some Queen videos such as Bohemian Rhapsody and I Want to Break Free are probably worth talking about in detail because they were such trendsetters, but ALL OF THEM?  No.  It's very tedious.  In another section, Freestone details every single inch of the interior of Garden Lodge.  By this I mean he spends pages and pages talking about what furniture was placed where and the entire layout of the mansion.  While a little of this may have been interesting, he goes on about it for far too long, with none of the details really connecting much on a personal level.  It is nice for example, to know about Freddie's love for art and his penchant for hanging it all over the mansion, but I didn't need to know the color of every rug and every stick of furniture and where it was placed or the exact location and view of every single room in both the main house and the mews.  Again, tedious information told in a boring style that makes you want to turn the page without reading.    On a more positive note, Freestone's telling of Freddie's final months and weeks is very tasteful and touching.  His recounting of Freddie's last day and the removal of his body from the mansion is an absolute tear-jerker.  You can feel the affection that Freestone had for his boss and friend, and it isn't fake.    Overall, I feel that Freestone wrote this book for the right reasons, but that his writing style and some of the information he presented left a lot to be desired.  He included information that seemed extraneous, maybe in an effort to make the book longer, I'm not sure.  Then there is other information that he seems to leave out almost entirely, such as Freddie's interaction with and feelings about the other members of the band.  All he says about this is that Freddie mostly interacted with them in a \\"work\\" setting.  That may be true, but there's no way you can convince me that Freddie knew and worked with these three men for 20 plus years and didn't have feelings for them and/or about them.  Maybe Freestone just wasn't privy to these feelings/dynamics (hard to believe since he toured with the band for several years and worked for all four of them before he began to work solely for Freddie) so that's why he doesn't talk about them, but it is disappointing.  He comments very little on Freddie's relationships with key people such as Mary Austin, Jim Hutton, his sister Kash, his parents, etc.  He also throws out bits of seemingly interesting information and then doesn't follow up on it.  For example, Freestone comments that Freddie was \\"very very fond\\" of Dominique Taylor and remained friends with her even after Roger left her.  But then he doesn't really follow up with any anecdotes concerning the two of them, their interactions together, how Dominique reacted to Freddie's illness/death, etc.  He provides some entertaining details of a day spent with Michael Jackson in Encino, and then proceeds to tell us that he and Freddie \\"dished\\" about the day on their way home.  But then he doesn't tell us what all was said other than Freddie lamenting that Michael had money but no taste.  Frustrating moments like this are heavily sprinkled throughout the book.    If you're a Freddie fan I would recommend the book, but just be mindful that you'll probably be compelled (as I was) to skip around and only read parts of it, skipping the extraneous information that seems to go on for pages at a time.  You may also be frustrated by the disjointed nature of the narrative and stories of events or relationships that Freestone starts to relate and then abruptly fails to elaborate on.    Overall a decent effort with heart and humor.  Aside from Jim Hutton (whose book I haven't read), I doubt that anyone else with intimate knowledge of Freddie (and by that I mean Mary Austin, Freddie's family, or any one of the remaining band members) will ever (out of respect and loyalty) write a book on him.  If that assumption holds true, Freestone's account is probably the best we're going to get - at least from someone who knew Freddie so well and so personally.  I continue to hope for a well researched biography from a respected biographer who wasn't necessarily there, but who is committed to presenting the truth in a fair, interesting, and well-balanced way.  The upcoming \\"Is This The Real Life?\\" by Mark Blake may be something to watch for if you're looking for a great biography of the band as a whole.  I haven't yet seen it or read it, but I hear good things!
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Drive Angry is a good Grindhouse flavored time that would have been great on a double bill with Dwayne Johnson's Faster back in the day. Machete could even be added for a classic Wood's, McVickers, or original Oriental Theatre in Chicago triple bill. Remakes of Pirahna, I Spit On Your Grave and others along with a ton of direct to dvd flicks have added to this trend. In other words, Hollywood is finally getting it several years after Rodriguez & Tarantino's Grindhouse opus. There's nothing wrong with silly, trashy, forgettable (unless you watch them repeatedly like me), over the top films that help you escape life's daily issues. Here, we have Nicholas Cage as an escapee from Hell who goes on a rampage in order to save his grandchild from a psychotic cult led by Billy Burke. With help from a feisty young woman with nothing to lose (Amber Heard), an old friend (David Morse), and ultimately, the mysterious Accountant (William Fichtner), our anti-hero mows down everything in his way with a variety of guns and other weapons. Wait until you see The God Killer in action. Drive Angry is a ridiculously violent and vulgar road trip that will leave you exhausted when it's over. I saw it in 3D and can't wait to own the dvd. If you're looking for fun, this is the rollercoaster ride for you. Ignore the prudes and others who knock this type of film. Sometimes, it's all about a good time with good refreshments. The Grindhouse experience is alive and well again and I hope it never goes away.

B003UESJH4|5.0|One doesn't often get to listen to a superb script wrapped in an unfolding plot executed with flawless acting in one film. In this one, you get all of what you can expect and more.<br /><br />Colin Firth plays the Duke of York, \\"Bertie\\" who is the second in line to the throne. He loathes the public spotlight and public speaking because of his stammer. His wife, Elizabeth decides to engage an obscure Australian whose address lists nothing more than his name, Lionel Logue and the words \\"Speech Defects.\\" Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, sets the terms and conditions of the visit. After several failed attempts with doctors and an impatient King George V, played by Simon Chandler, she puts her royal conditions aside to accept his. But their first meeting does not go well as the Duke is demoted to an equal of a commoner. Faced with the prospect of a second meeting or the humiliation of public speaking he reluctantly submits to Logue's lessons and therapy.<br /><br />Two events raise the ugly specter of speaking to his subjects. His father dies and his brother, David gives up the throne to marry a divorcee. Logue is there to assist him again despite the effort of the Archishop of Canterbury (played by Derek Jacobi) who attempts to throw an adjustable spanner in their relationship. Will it destroy the trust \\"Bertie\\" has developed for \\"Lionel\\" right before the coronation, or has a bond of friendship developed that is too strong to cast aside?<br /><br />Colin Firth draws a depth of emotion I never thought capable in what I had previously thought of a waxed figure from previous performances. The timing of his stammers and taut facial expressions captures the approach-avoidance conflict of a noble wanting to fulfill his royal obligations versus running and hiding from any public appearance.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush uses his eyes to convey his depth of feeling that he keeps under control, peering, evaluating, what makes his charge stammer so badly. You can see him searching for what cannot be seen but is yet to be known. His keen perception is revealed with spontaneous challenges and a quick wit and calm demeanor that contrasts with that of his patient.<br /><br />Helen Bonham Carter plays the Duke's adoring and supportive wife. (After her husband's death she would simply be known as the Queen Mum). Clair Bloom plays the Duke's mother, and Guy Pearce plays his older brother, the Prince of Wales, the soon to be Edward VII, and sooner to be Duke of Windsor. He is portrayed in a less flattering role when dealing with his younger brother's affliction. Every performance is masterful.<br /><br />This is a movie that is not to be missed. It has received numerous nominations for Academy Awards that will be revealed later this evening. I hope you will spend one evening in your home or theater to watch a command performance.

B000EOTTOK|3.0|Lawrence Kasdan's sprawling western biopic WYATT EARP was originally supposed to be a three-night, six hour TV miniseries. It has its strong points (an amazing cast, well-defined characters, attention to detail, striking cinematography) but I always come away with a feeling that something's missing. Maybe it's the other three hours.<br /><br />Too bad Gene Hackman's role was limited, perhaps by editing. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday really suffered for his art. He starved off 30+ lbs. to play the tubercular gunslinger. Those who like Kevin Costner (I do!) will enjoy him here. (Look close in some scenes, for that's Wyatt's actual revolver Kevin is holding. It was loaned by the Earp Museum for this film.)<br /><br />Not everyone will like this picture, as it does tend to linger in spots. WYATT EARP is however required viewing for all western movie aficionados.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.4) Wyatt Earp (1994) - Kevin Costner/Dennis Quaid/Gene Hackman/Mark Harmon/Michael Madsen/Catherine O'Hara/Bill Pullman/Isabella Rossellini/Tom Sizemore/JoBeth Williams/Mare Winningham/Adam Baldwin/Annabeth Gish/James Caviezel/T&eacute;a Leoni/Lawrence Kasden (cameo)
0375831002|1.0|Unless your teen has good knowledge of what happened in Germany during World War II, an exceptional vocabulary and the ability to read flowery and vague symbolic passages (many) and make sense of them,  it will be a tough read.  The book is fine if you're reading it with them, but if they're reading it independently they will be quite frustrated and only get about 70% of what's going on.  Knowledge of communism, Nazi philosophy, what happened in concentration camps (specifically), and why Germany would have been bombed by someone (the book never says who is bombing) are essential.  The end of the book leaves too many unanswered questions - it's as if the author thought 550 pages was enough and didn't finish his story lines well at all.
B00006IU73|3.0|I have only started listening to Porcupine Tree recently. Having started with \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\", which I think is a truly great album, this one seems a bit more run-of-the-mill. This is a good rock album, and has an interesting concept and a fair amount of variety, but there's nothing on here that matches FOABP's truly distinct and individual tracks -- some of the tracks on \\"In Absentia\\" sound a bit generic.    Maybe it's not fair to analyze the album in retrospect, but if you are someone who has come to listen to PT recently then I think you'd do better to start with some of their more recent albums.    In other words, as a band and based on their creative progress to date, I give Porcupine Tree 5 stars. But this album is not their best, in my opinion -- and this is a GOOD thing if you want to listen to a band whose best years are not in their past.

B003UESJFG|5.0|I'm indifferent to Will Ferrell - don't think I've ever seen any of his movies.  I only watched this because it's animation.  But it made me truly belly laugh.  I'm not sure any other animated movie that isn't a Warner's cartoon has made me laugh so much - and I feel we're living in a new golden age (platinum? diamond?)  of animation.  The laughs alone win me over.  I watched it again just to see if I wasn't in a \\"mood\\" the first go round and it was even funnier the second time.    The animation is top notch.  Megamind's wild gesticulations - even his lips get in on the act - are true physical comedy.  I think about Woody's \\"You are a toy!\\" speech from TS1, where you could watch the scene in Swahili and it would still be funny.  Even the camera gets in on the act.  If there was an award for best comic performance that included animated characters...    Some feel that this is an inferior effort because it supposedly is not heartfelt.  Perhaps I have a weakness for the character, being misunderstood and evil myself.  The heart is there, but the comedy comes first.  Is that so wrong?  It makes this movie the perfect bookend with \\"HTTY Dragon\\", which never mis-stepped into modern references.    And references?  Some reviewers seem to claim the movie is just a mish-mash of pop references that will be outdated by this time next year.  I'm not sure they actually payed attention to the movie.  Sure, it is heavily indebted to the standard superhero genre, but that's about it.  Even the music is 80s rock - hardly a sop thrown to get tweeners into theater seats.  Okay, there is the \\"No You Can't\\" poster ref, but I want that on a t-shirt.    As for those who for some reason can't seem to get over the fact that this movie (not labeled in anyway as 3-D) is not in 3-D (and there do seem to be a solid handful of such folks) - learn to read.  Learn to wait for the product you want.  Figure out that Megamind 3D is a Samsung exclusive and deal with it.  Don't run down a movie that youobviously enjoyed in some weird reverse psychology attempt to get something you want.  The lower the rating, the lower the sales, and the less likely it will get a 3D release.  Your evil has backfired.  Music Man wants to sing for you.    So, in conclusion, laughs, comedy, great animation, great voicework.  I've got to go - my spyider bite is acting up.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is perhaps the single best movie I've watched in 10 years, and that includes the Americanized version \\"Let Me In\\" released just last year. I understand that all here don't know who I am, but I am an amateur writer, as well as an avid vampire movie and literature fan since the '70's.     \\"Let the Right One In\\" and \\"Let Me In\\" are the best vampire genre films I have watched since Stephen King's vampire masterpiece \\"Salem's Lot\\", which I firmly believe is the standard of modern vampire movies today.    It was probably better that \\"Let Me In' was an independent film here in America, because otherwise, modern day Hollywood, big budget gory special effects would have ruined what actually carried these films... their amazing acting casts and performances.     Powerful, emotional, horrifying, and endearing all at once, \\"Let The Right One In\\" and it's sister film \\"Let Me In\\" transcend the typical hollywood vampires portrayed as glamourous, exotic, and alluring. In these films, the young boys Oskar (Let The Right One In), and counterpart Owen (Let Me In), show the real side of growing up by dealing with divorced parents, alcoholism, searching for identity, and frightening school bullies. The young-looking vampires Eli (Let The Right One In), and American counterpart Abby (Let Me In), display the loneliness, violence, and eternal hunger for blood that more accurately desplays vampirism as a curse more than as a gift.    This is REAL film-making... dirty, intense, down-to-Earth, in-your-face story-telling that grabs you and doesn't let you go until the final scene is finished.    Poor subtitles be damned. I hate using sub-titles anyway. In \\"Let The Right One In\\", I just used the English voice-over version over the original Swedish language. The English voice-overs are a little tinny and don't quite seem right, but they still deliver the movie's story well. The Swedish film is more true to the book by author Jon Linquist with some minor story-line changes occuring in the American version \\"Let Me In\\".    I guarantee that if you're a true vampire genre fan, you'll watch this film and the Americanized version over and over again. I've watched \\"Let The Right One In' three times already, and \\"Let Me In\\" six times. Don't allow yourself to be denied what is a great film because others didn't like some DVD st-up features.     \\"Let The Right One In\\" delivers.

I am more of a spiritual/ knowledge type person and business/enterpreneurship have never interested me AT ALL, but I would have a lot of problems without this book. It will you a clear idea how money works and how to make them work for you. Most of all how not to work 24/7 and still be in depth. I said to myslef( I am 23) that I never ever want to work like my parents. Woring nearly day and night for someone else and never having enough and never felt that they have enough.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best mini-series produced in England, second only to the Prime Suspect series with England's finest actor, Helen Mirren.  Taut, well written script brought to life with superb acting particularly by Bill Nighy who never gives a bad performance and Kelly MacDonald (Gosford Park).  Too many reviewers have rehashed the story; therefore, I will spare you.  But, I must say this is an ABSOLUTE MUST BUY for your library.<br /><br />Nothing since Band of Brothers has been made decent television viewing much less Emmy deserving.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Some of the best music I've heard in ages!  Mumford & Sons bring life to music again.  In the age of music where pop is king, Mumford & Sons use folk melodies to evoke emotion that no pop song will ever be able to do.  5 stars.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Okay, this is a real joke.  I rated this memory card when I got it and the vendor keeps hounding me with phone calls to change my rating from what I had previously rated it.  They wanted a 5 out of it.  Eventhough I don't rate it a 5 I had to go in and rate it a 5 in order for them to keep from blowing my phone up with phone calls.  What kinda system do we have here if we cannot be honest about how we feel without getting hounded by the vendor because they did not like what we rated it.  What a joke on this vendor.
0316017922|4.0|Good book.  Lot of information that I found interesting.    Book is a little disjointed and jumps around a little but maybe its the authors style that I found a little annoying.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet.  I feel every American should see this film so they can think twice as to where their food comes from.  It will make you really think about what you are eating and feeding your family.
B001HPP2XW|4.0|Audrey Hepburn stars in her most well-known movie role. George Peppard costars as her neighbor. Soundtrack with famous song \\"Moon River.\\" New York City is the bakdrop for this film. Buddy Ebsen has a cameo and Mickey Rooney in a politically uncorrect role.
B000006UD8|4.0|4/5. The sixth studio album from Deep Purple turned out to be one of the most influential records of hard rock/heavy metal genre in the 70s. The powerful sound, explosive drums, tremendous riffs and solo duels between guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and organist Jon Lord keep even simple song structures very busy and help to establish the essence of Deep Purple as one of the finest bands of the 70s. The opening track \\"Highway Star\\" is close both musically and thematically to the song \\"Speed King\\" from the \\"In Rock\\" album. \\"Pictures of Home\\" and one of the greatest and most famous songs that Deep Purple ever recorded - the timeless \\"Smoke On The Water\\" - are both inspired by the hard time Deep Purple had recording the album in Switzerland. The latter was actually the only one that the band managed to record at the Pavilion before moving on to recording the rest of the album in the cold and lonesome Grand Hotel that was shut down and abandoned for winter. It is interesting that while the song was recorded the roadies had been desperately holding the doors shut against the police who were attempting to enter and have Deep Purple stop working as the level of noise in the middle of the night was keeping the entire town awake (if Montreaux residents only knew that one of the most recognizable songs in the history of rock music was being recorded!). The song lyrics are actually the account of Deep Purple experience in making the album, when they booked recording time at the Casino in Montreaux, Switzerland and came down with the pricey Rolling Stones mobile studio to record the album. However, one day before recording was scheduled to start, Frank Zappa was performing at the Casino and as Deep Purple enjoyed the concert in a private seating area, somebody from the audience fired a flare gun off into the ceiling, causing a fire which burnt the entire building - to be the recording site of Deep Purple - into the ground.   As the Swiss time was running out Deep Purple had to record the album within severe time limits and it feels on the album that lyrics were written right in the midst of composing the songs. This is particularly so about \\"Space Trucking\\" - the concluding song which also features an annoying Blackmore riff and slightly irritating chorus vocals and should have better be replaced with \\"When a Blind Man Cries\\" - one of the most melodic Purple songs with poignant lyrics which did not make it into the album and was originally released as B-side on the \\"Never Before\\" single. The remixed version of the song featured on the second CD of the anniversary edition sounds even more impressive than the original with somewhat more solid structure and guitar solos.   The anniversary edition contains a great booklet with story behind the album and rare photographs, but on the other hand, differences between remixes of album tracks featured and original versions are hardly noticeable at all. The differences are only about some alternative solos, an original drum intro on \\"Pictures of Home\\" and some of the songs that faded out on original versions running their course.   A quintessential album that bears in itself the very spirit of the 70s. It is so unfortunate that Deep Purple did not build on this success and despite \\"Machine Head\\" was the most successful album ever released by Deep Purple, it was also the beginning of a bad period. As greater successes meant more money involved in publishing the songs, conflicts and general despondency began between band members, opening way for endless series of lineup changes and shifting the band off the center of the super band league. -Sain Alizada
B004A8ZX28|3.0|I guess if you really want to put an American in a harsh situation, have him lose his memory in a foreign country. For Americans that's probably the closest thing to Hell on Earth, right up there with being denied Monday Night Football in Hi-Def. (Just kidding) A few films have similar premises of an American being a fish out of his own waters: \\"the Bourne Identity\\", \\"Frantic\\", and \\"Seven Days Seven Nights\\". Hollywood is also replete with stories about people either losing their memories or simply being \\"lost\\" inside a political situation because of forces beyond their control, such as \\"the Changeling\\", Hitchcock's \\"Spellbound\\", \\"the Truman Show\\"; even \\"Total Recall\\" and \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" have similarities.<br /><br />The one element that saves these movies is the premise of the main character being in essentially a \\"no win situation\\". Despite how contrived or \\"unrealistic\\" the whole plot is, if the character is interesting enough, and the situation compelling enough, then you tend to run with it. Part of the fun is learning the greater story along with the character. It may have become a rather over-used plot devise, but it tends to work, in part because pieces of the puzzle can be thrown at the character without him understanding what it means.<br /><br />\\"Unknown\\" falls into this category of a character being trapped in a situation he does not completely understand, and the story is told almost entirely from the his point of view. After a near-death experience in Berlin, an American wakes up in a hospital room and his only knowledge is that he is Dr Martin Harris and he was there for a Biotech conference. But he has lost his identification along the way, and no one seems to believe him. He even returns to the hotel where he was supposed to be staying and finds his wife. Except his wife not only denies him but appears to be married to a man also by the name of Dr Martin Harris. Will the real Martin Harris please stand up? Starts to ring of a suspense version of the old television show \\"To Tell the Truth\\" where three people would claim they were the same person, and panelists would try to figure out who was the \\"real\\" person.<br /><br />I don't see \\"and the nominees for Best Actor are Liam Neeson for Uknown\\" in the near future, but at the same time it really is Neeson who makes the entire film work. His honesty as an actor delivers a performance right on the money that kept me on the edge of my seat most of the way, to the point where I really wanted to know how he would get out of this. I never quite fell out of my chair, the way I did when I saw the original \\"the Bourne Identity\\" with Richard Chamberlain, but \\"Unknown\\" is first-rate entertainment of the escapist variety.<br /><br />The two leading ladies also keep the entertainment level high, particularly January Jones (of Mad Men fame) who plays against type, as the loyal wife turned traitor. And Diane Kruger as a Bosnian refugee who is working in Berlin to eventually get her immigration papers reluctantly befriends Neeson and becomes an integral part of the plot. Roger Ebert in his review points out that a lot of things are too coincidental. Yeah...it's a suspense/action movie. So what else is new? If there's anything I can say about \\"Unknown\\" is you'll never find yourself looking at your watch, which is pretty high praise these days.old television show \\"To Tell the Truth\\" where three people would claim they were the same person, and panelists would try to figure out who was the \\"real\\" person.

B000001EYO|5.0|I just recently watched The Big Lebowski iconic film by the Coen Brothers and not only loved the movie but was blown away by the eclectic and brilliant soundtrack.  Over the years, I became aware that the film and Jeff Bridges character has created a cult following and I was clueless regarding the soundtrack.  There are more than a few gems on this album: Captain Beefheart-Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles, Nina Simone-I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good, Henry Mancini-Lujon, The Gipsy Kings spanish language rendition of Hotel California (goosebumps)...just too name a few.  I purchased this album on Amazon.com. (Excellent service and prices).
B001KX50BK|5.0|How much do I love this movie, short story, I've seen more times than any other and I watch a lot of movies.  This Blu-ray disc is by far the best experience yet.  Two things stand out. One the color and clarity makes me feel like I am seeing it in color for the first time, exceptional!  Even more important to me, it is the original theatrical version, without all the drug/gang additions. I have fallen in love with \\"Pretty Woman\\" all over again.  Dena's husband Larry.

B0007DFJ0G|3.0|Hmmm...<br /><br />This is an excellently acted, directed and produced film. Based on a creepy self-loathing script replete with scato-physical and scato-sexual fantasies. It would seem that the writer is exorcising his geeky ghosts at the expense of the viewing (and paying) public. The pseudo-anarchism seems like a cry for help. Can one appreciate great acting based on a bombastic self-indulgent script? There, right there, is the reviewer's dilemma.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I purchased this album (The King is Dead, The Decemberists) based on a excellent review in Rolling Stone Magazine.  I was aware of The Decemberists music but had not really explored it or listened to it until now.  Beautiful voices, lyrics and melodies. It is refreshing to hear lovely, intelligent lyrics and a lead singer whose voice is wonderful and sings in such a way as you can actually understand the lyrics.  Recommend this album to anyone with a eclectic taste in music.  This band and their music is at the height of their creative talents.  I purchased this CD through Amazon.com which offers excellent variety, prices and service.
1584282584|5.0|A lot of Neil's experience comes from weddings, but this is also the type of photographic discipline that forces you to work quickly, in uncontrollable environment, and where good results are a must.    Neil's book helps to understand fully your equipment, camera and flash, the communication between the two, bounding scenarios, as well as a lot of theory in the beginning, necessary to know before you go deeper with flash-techniques.    Loved the way he writes (unfortunately, many photographers are not good writers, which makes it hard to go through the theory, but Neil is a great writer).
030726999X|5.0|An exciting continuation of the saga of Lisbeth Salander. A real page turner! You will find it hard to put it down, but with over 500 pages, you will have to take a break. Very detailed so that you actually feel like you know the lead characters, and can't wait to see what happens next!<br />It would be a dream to have a 4th book, but this is not possible.
0596805888|5.0|I purchased this book for a friend and it was a huge hit! The title is fun, O'Reilly is a great text book company, and apparently the recipes are loose and delicious. What more could you want in a cookbook?! My friend really enjoyed it.

B000FBFN1U|3.0|I really, really enjoyed [[ASIN:B000QCS8TW A Game of Thrones]] and [[ASIN:B000FC1HBY A Clash of Kings]]. 5 stars for each. A Storm of Swords, however, is leaving me feeling depressed. It is just too dark. I am not looking for a Harry Potter-type series here, where all the good guys win and all the bad guys lose. But come ON. Give me something. A little shred of hope to hold on to. I am 60% through the book (according to my Kindle), and I don't want to pick it back up. I've just finished two consecutive chapters filled with the deaths of all of my favorite people. I can't handle it anymore.    Is it too much to ask for a nice mix of good guys living and dying? Instead of them all dying?     I'm not sure I will finish this book, or if I will read the next. I hope in the HBO series they change it a bit and let some of the more likable characters live.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love this video.  I love how its set up so you can choose your intensity level.  And I enjoy the fact that she shows you all 3 ways to do each level...meaning high impact, normal, or low impact.  It's extremely easy to follow and very challenging.  I haven't seen a lot of weight loss, but I've only been able to do it 2-3 times a week instead of the recommended daily routine b/c of kids and life. I also haven't changed my diet.  But I feel better and really do feel like I'm toning up.  I'm sure if I was adament about the daily routine, I would \\"shred\\" the 20 lbs I want to lose.  I will continue to use this video!  I definitely recommend it just for the fitness level and simplicity of it!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|As I have seen the previous 7 seasons of this series of 24, one is always critical of the next season, because historically the sequel or follow-up season is never as good as the previous season. Now with 24 it is obviously a complete different story, you cant wait for the following season. Unfortunately for us the 24 fanatics this is seemingly the final season, what a pity. Well as they say all good things must come to an end. For that reason I purchased the eighth season so that I can view it for years to come.
0765326353|3.0|The Way of Kings, I like the title and I like the cover. Those two things with a clearance sell Borders got me to pick up this book.     The Good:    The narrative is very good and the story is engrossing. I have characters I really enjoy and charactes I really dislike. Even the guys I do not like, I have a grudging respect for, they are complete characters. I really do like the money system developed, it was very unique. The story has a good beginning and an solid stoping point.      The Bad:    The organization of the story makes me want to skip chapters at times. I feel that way because the chapters seem randomly inserted into the story, like you go from Dalinar to 7 years before talking with Kaladin as a child. The transition does not feel good and I tend to skim (at best) those sections. There also seems to be a very big gulf in between when characters have their own sections. You go hundreds of pages not hearing from Shallen, to the point you almost for get she is a character. Something major happens to Kaladin in the first 100 pages of the book or so and instead of explaining it Sanderson draws out the details over many different parts of the book. At one point I just wanted to yell, 'JUST TELL ME!!!'. Lasly I do not get the little spirit references, I sure hope they are detailed later in the series.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes have been dubbed the last true rock and roll band by an increasing mass of critics who believe that in the wake of their breakup, rock is officially dead.  When the charts indicate that anti-intellectual-glitter pop and gangster rap are at a premium, it's easy to lose ones self in modern apathy, as every cyber portal seems self motivated to shove some flavor-of-the-week artist down your throat.  This level of confusion, disappointment and fear really only applies to people who have artistic integrity - or who can at least respect it - because they are the true critics.  In essence, when you consider the evolving trends in the music industry, and the fact that the median IQ is sinking into the double digits, I think it's fair to decree that the charts are entirely useless.  The charts are for the blind public, because basically, it's just troth-fed fodder for the casual music consumer.  A dark cloud hangs, and because of its inability to judge music for its competence and meaning, I feel that \\"Icky Thump\\" will not get the public admiration that it deserves.  This is a band that threw in the towel for all the right reasons, and it's with bittersweet admiration that I say goodbye, thank you, and keep trucking.      Reviewing this record has been more than a stress lap in examining innovation and analyzing themes and motifs.  It being their last record, I think it's more respectful that we just listen.  Any hey, for whatever my opinion is worth, it's a pretty good record.
B0000067L2|5.0|This CD is a remastered version of Cream's most popular album. It contains the perfect essence of the '60s with a combination of megahits like \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" and weird treasures like \\"Dance The Night Away\\". If you are looking for some awesome flashback music, check this out! Also, I would like to point out that I think this CD only contains remastered songs, not the original versions.
0670022411|5.0|At last an adult book for the witch, vampire, daemon loving   creature! It is a captivating novel complete with unusal wines, which is fabulous, love, lust and historic references. If you truly love a novel you can sink your teeth into this is it. Ms. Harkness developes the characters and settings so vividly you'd think you were there. This book does not fail on any level and is destined to be one of your favorites! The trouble is what do I read next???
B003O86FMW|5.0|So you read the first one, you know you are going to end up reading the next 2, so why even look for a review?  It continues on and still as enticing as the first.  Of course nothing matches the original, but this is an awesome part 2.  Don't short change yourself with the storyline, go ahead and read this for the same reasons you read the 1st book.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|I love any book that makes me think about things in new ways.  I was hesitant at first to get this for the price of it, as I have been reading the free classics for a while, but I have heard much about it and been wanting to read it for a while, so I just treated myself.  I enjoyed it and it gave you lots of great examples about how people become great many times due to things that put them in places at the right time.  Treat yourself to the book if you have been wanting to read it for a while.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|It seems as if \\"film buffs\\" are getting dumber and dumber nowadays. What are you guys wanting out of a movie called \\"Drive Angry 3D\\" and with Nic Cage??? Bergman??? I myself like a good, well written movie as much as anyone. But I like to pop a top and kick back and watch fun movies, and that's where Drive Angry 3D comes in. Definitely what I needed after a long day at work. This film has tonnes of cliches, is impossibly stupid and is over the top and trashy, but that was the point. I must say there was not a dull moment!!! There's tonnes of gore too- including Nic Cage walking around with a nasty looking shot eye for a good portion of the movie too. As for the 3D... well, if you've seen My Bloody Valentine 3D, Patrick Lussier's previous movie, you know what to expect- 3D gore, weapons flying in your face and this is no exception. There's crowbars, explosions, bullets, Cage pointing guns in your face, etc. This movie pulls a ton of punches, and you will just love it. As for the acting... let's face it, Nic was born for the action, tough guy roles. He is a total badass and it's just awesome to watch. William Fichter is class too, he is total suave and stylish fun to watch. Heard is sexy and is a great actress too.<br /><br />Overall, if you can go in expecting total cheese, you will love this movie, and make no mistake, this is a total must see. I had a total blast, and I predict you will too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read all the review before I got this and saw both positive and negative, but I am the type to see for myself.  I heard the plot was disturbing, and it was slightly if you really think about it, but in the context of the story, it didn't get to me at all.  The writing style of the author is great and every chapter leaves you in a cliffhanger that you do not want to put the book down.  If you don't like the idea of kids killing each other, which I hope most don't, don't think that it will make you hate the book.  We know it is fiction, and this is a great story.
B00000I41G|5.0|After careful consideration, having listened to many, many jazz guitar recordings I'm going to say that I agree with Ben Fernandez' short review here on Midnight Blue - this is the best jazz guitar (studio) recording ever made.  The mood is incomparable.  Midnight Blue transcends being a great jazz guitar record and becomes an essential jazz album.  Truly a \\"desert island cd\\".
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the first 2, and am sure you did also since you are looking into the 3rd one here.  How can you stop now?  We have invested too much time reading so far, can't stop now knowing there is more to read.  Here it continues straight from book 2 and while you are still waiting to see what happens next.  It drags slightly here.  At least all the answers are given, especially in the Peeta vs Gale debate.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|When I first heard Daft Punk was making the soundtrack for TRON my mind was blown.  When I saw the movie, I was disappointed to find that it was standard classical movie music with some Daft Punk beats thrown in.  It's still some really great music, but I was expecting something more along the lines of Discovery or Homework.  Still a really great album with a bunch of good songs.

0375758992|2.0|Have you ever known someone who likes to talk a little bit too much?  They go on and on with story after story.  Some of it is entertaining, but it doesn't all link together and make much sense.  If so, that would be a good description of this book.  Parts of it are entertaining and interesting, but it mostly feels like random jumps, one after another, with no glue to hold it all together.  Random stories with a lot of negativity and very little redeeming value.  It didn't work for me.
193659434X|5.0|For many years, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, has been considered a classic Christmas novel. In America, people are becoming increasingly busy and more concerned with themselves around Christmas time. The spirit of Christmas is making its way out of the American culture and becoming a distant memory. A central theme in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the renewal of this spirit as depicted in the life of the main character Ebeneezer Scrooge.    The setting for A Christmas Carol is in London, England during the 19th century. At the time, England was undergoing an industrial revolution. Money was to be made!  I feel such is the case today as technology is revolutionizing the way business is run in today's society. The main character, Ebeneezer Scrooge, is a money dealer who, along with his business partner Jacob Marley, gave loans to various people and institutions needing financial assistance. Over the years and after the death of his business partner, the love of money hardened the heart of this once cheerful man.  I was reminded, while reading, how money hardens people's heart is found in the world today. Scams are becoming an increasingly popular topic in the news. Truly, money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Throughout the course of this book, Scrooge experiences a change of heart while he reviews Christmas memories and once again discovers what it is like to feel and live the Christmas spirit. As I read this book, I felt that desire--the desire to rediscover what it feels like to live the Christmas spirit. While reading this book, I felt the emptiness that comes when one is focused solely inward during the Christmas season and the joy comes when the spirit of Christmas motivates one to lift and serve others.    I am a lover of good literature. Recently, I have noticed myself becoming busier during the Christmas season than in past years. While reading of Scrooges' Christmas memories, I couldn't help but put myself in his shoes. By so doing, the spirit of Christmas returned to my life. What a difference that made in my enjoyment of the Christmas season! I recognized what was truly important--remembering Christ by serving others. This book is a great read for anyone; especially those who feel they have lost the Christmas spirit and have the desire to rekindle it again.
B0044RFT8S|5.0|Madagascar is another fine release from Dreamworks.  They have created a CG Animated catalog to is only rivaled by Pixar  The Bluray transfer is excellent. Picture 5/5 Sound 4/5 (Because it is 5.1) Blurays have the capability to deliver 7.1 audio, but the loss-less track is very well done.  My wife and kids loved this are just as entertained by this watching it over and over.  Dreamworks decision to include DVDs and not digital copies was a wise choice.  Every other digital copy I try to download into iTunes fails because they are expired.  Why oh why do the studios do this.  Digital copies are splashed over the covers of DVDs and now Bluray.  So kudos to Dreamworks for including proper DVDs.  For those of us that have children and travel, at least me, love having a DVD to play in the minivan and my portable DVD player.  They occasionally put out stinkers like Shrek the Third, but they knocked it out of the ball park with this movie.
B00275EGX8|5.0|An amazingly visceral and potent look at war its costs.  Expert direction and stunning cinematography.  A film that manages to be suspenseful and thrilling but at the same time sober and unromantic.  A truly great film.
0670022411|4.0|Ladies and ladies (since I doubt the gents picking this up though confident and cool are few and far between), this book is a mouthwatering mashup of Twilight, Outlander, The Historian, and The Da Vinci Code.  Yes.  Seriously.  Though nowhere near as insane as Outlander, it is epic, it is fun.   Our heroine is one sweet young thang, Diana Bishop, a witch hailing from a long line of other witches, including an infamous one in infamously witch-loving Salem, MA.   Since her parents bit it suspiciously on a trip to Africa when she was a kid, Diana has been denying herself and the world of her magical powerz through a combination of pensive pre-dawn rowing sessions and a historical study of alchemy.  Alchemy being the ye olde science equivalent of magic.  Clearly she's doing a great job!  On sabbatical to Oxford to fondle some dusty old books in Bodlean, Diana finds and promptly returns a freaky enchanted book, and immediately stumbles into the arms of a hot doctor.  Suspect! Double suspect, he is not just a doctor!  Oh ho! He is a hot VAMPIRE doctor!  Matthew Clairmont is impossibly fast and strong, his skin is pale white and ice cold, and sometimes he speaks like he's from a different time!  His powers include being hot, being a badass predator, being a doctor, being ascetic, being immortal, having lots of secrets, being part of a vampire gang, and having a penchant for fine wines.  If it weren't for the last, I'm pretty sure the Cullen's would have adopted him by now.  But I digress!      Turns out a ancient pact of witches, vampires, and ghouls want the book real bad - it may or may not have the secret to magical life tucked away inside and it has been MIA since nigh on forever - and now that everyone knows Diana fondled it, they're all after her.  To boot, said secret society also has a rule on intermagical species dating.  As the Germans say, VERKLEMPT! Oh snap.  But they are not the only secret ancient society out there, and lines are drawn (to steal yet another Stephenie Meyerism) irrevocably.  Our heroes are on the run to places near and far, bourgeois and swank, denying their love, proclaiming their love, doing yoga, and sipping wine throughout.  Will Diana ever embrace her magical powers?  Will Matthew ever not be hot?  Will you be able to avoid craving wine while reading this book?    This book is filled with many things you would expect of anything that has been hit with the romance or paranormal genre sticks:  hot vampires, breaking in to watch people sleep (aka studying at the school of Edward Stalker Cullen), longing looks, pensive walks in the woods, near death fights, surviving near death fights, dudes carrying girls, girls sitting on dudes laps all the time, declarations of true love, opulent vampire lifestyles, hot baths, etc.  But it failed majorly on one count.  I was expecting it to be much more smutty.  I love smutty books!  In fact, there is no. sex. at. all.  I'd have given you a spoiler warning, but consider this your sex disappointment warning.  What up with that Deborah E. Harkness?  No excuses!  What is this, Twilight?    At times the story can drag; there was probably way too much scholarly debate in the first half and not nearly enough action.  It also becomes clear with 200 pages to go that this book is going to be the first in a series.  However, there is a lot to redeem it and judging from the fact that I devoured this book, it's relatively captivating.  If you are anything like me, you will probably be amused by the ridiculous wine sniffing activities (turns out Ms. Harkness has a wine blog), Vampire yoga, convenience of Matthew knowing every historical figure mentioned, inclusion of gay primary characters, occasionally clunky dialogue, and (antiquated) semantics of (vampire) marriage. In short, this post is not short and neither is the book.  But if you at all like reading series or epic paranormal-time traveling-historical fiction books, this is a strong recommendation!
1400052173|5.0|I loved this true account of Henrietta Lacks, a poor African American woman who grew up in the 1920s to 1950s before she died of cervical cancer. Before dying, biopsies of her cervix were taken without her permission, resulting in a virtual scientific revolution in the study of cells. From Henrietta's cells, which multiplied and continued to grow long after she died, in the laboratories of medical scientists the world over, diseases became more understandable and cures were found for some (e.g., polio, some cancers). The ethical issue about the lack of informed consent and the fact that Henrietta's family did not receive any benefit from the distribution and sale of her cells is discussed. Even more disheartening was that her family had serious medical problems and often no money for health insurance to cover them. It was also a startling revelation to hear the extent of ethical violations conducted in the name of science before institutional review boards demanded more accountability of scientists. Very worthwhile read that I almost missed as I initially wondered whether the book would be too heavy and depressing. Although disenchanting, at times, the book was incredibly engaging, drawing you into the real life stories of Henrietta and her family, as well as her seemingly indestructible cells.
B003OJBWGK|3.0|Rock music has always been dominated by men.  From Buddy Holly's pining for Peggy Sue to the libidinal poses of Jim Morrison, most rock and roll songs have been told from the perspective of those with a Y chromosome.  In fact, the masculine point of view has been so ingrained in rock and roll that when a woman wants into the tree house she has to prove that, like the rest of the guys, she can take just as many drugs and partake in just as much indiscriminant sex.  Janis Joplin, Grace Slick, and Joan Jett, to name a few, became rock and roll icons by asserting that whatever guys could do, they could do better.  The approach of what's-good-for-the-goose-is-even-better-for-the-gander has had its benefits, allowing women to break from roles traditionally created for them, but just as often it can serve to reinforce the whore/Madonna dichotomy that stretches back to long before Chuck Berry fashioned the first rock and roll song.    With this, incomplete, history of women in rock music I've come to Best Coast's debut album, Crazy for You, with some trepidation.  Lead singer Bethany Cosentino has a penchant for writing songs about lounging and longing that stand in stark contrast to the pioneers of women in rock.  Instead of making lyrics like \\"Take another little piece of my heart\\" sound like a challenge, Cosentino sings as if she spent the entire album holding onto her paramour's pants legs as he strolled out the door.  On the opener, \\"Boyfriend,\\" she sings, \\"I hope that he's at home / Waiting by his phone\\"; later, on \\"Goodbye,\\" she croons \\"Every time you leave this house / Everything falls apart\\"; and, finally, on \\"Bratty B,\\" she pleads \\"Pick up the phone / I wanna talk about how / I miss you so much.\\"  It's not that there aren't plenty of examples of guys pining over girls in songs, but has there ever been an album with this much self-destructive longing?  Cosentino has avoided the whore and Madonna stereotypes only to fall firmly into the just as damaging archetypeof the crazy girlfriend.    The songs themselves are reasonably catchy throwbacks to early rock and 60s girl groups.  Like most musicians who trade in retro styles, Best Coast play up the difference between the pristine Leave it to Beaver image of the past the internet ravaged present.  For her part, Cosentino presents herself as stewing in a cloud of marijuana and codependence.  Likewise, much like some of those early pop songs, here the sentiments are as simple as the rhymes.  It would be tempting, then, to read Best Coast's mix of longing and dependence as a critique of those classic songs, revealing to the reader the kind of damage that music inflicted on the image of women.  The only problem with this take on Best Coast is that it's a complete misreading of some of the best girl group songs.  When Dionne Warwick sings \\"Walk on by\\" to her ex, she's asserting the fact that pain is temporary just as much as she concedes that she has spilled more than a few tears since he has left.  Cosentino concedes much more than she asserts, and I suppose your enjoyment of Crazy for You depends on how much time you've spent sitting by the phone waiting for the girl in Biology class to ring you up.

0765326353|5.0|I just finished The Way of Kings and it solidified my opinion that Brandon Sanderson is one of the best writers of fantasy out there today.  He is the perfect finisher for Robert Jordan's epic work.  Sanderson has an amazing ability to create characters with personalities that are real and easy for the reader to understand and empathize with.  What I love about this book is the deeper lesson learned, that it is more important to care about the paths we take in life to our destinations, rather than the destination itself.  Some of the characters are defining examples of how mankind is full of imperfections and yet there are still some things one can perfect in themselves, virtues like honor and devotion to a cause greater than one's self.  There is too little of honor in the world today.  Also, Sanderson's worlds of \\"magic\\" are interesting and authentic.  If you love good fantasy with characters that you can get behind and root for, pick up The Way of Kings and read it, you'll love it!
B003ZK58WM|4.0|I have read Follett's medieval works, and this one gave me pause only because I prefer medieval history.  I took the plunge and was pleasantly surprised.  I love how he hones in on the motivations of men, in particular -- money, sex, power --  but the backdrop of the WWI is much more than window dressing.  He does a fantastic job of bringing the reader into the European and Russian experience of living through the War.  Although the level of detail on the  strategies each country took in fighting the war as well as the revolution in Russia occasionally slowed the pace of the story for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I came away understanding the war from a broader perspective than that which was imparted to me in history classes. I loved how he created accessible, yet flawed characters among the truly imperfect players in real history.  I deducted a star because it was pricey for a Kindle version.  On the other hand, the print version is mighty big, and I doubt I would have bothered toting it around in my purse for four days to read through.

B000WGWQG8|3.0|Worth watching, but view it with jaundiced eye.<br /><br />Not being a cable TV subscriber, the only HBO series I'd ever seen before this was the Tom Hanks produced \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\". I thought this might be an easy way to gain a bit more knowledge of a \\"founding father\\" whose history (I earned my undergraduate degree in the subject) I only knew as a side character in other biographies and histories of the American Revolution.<br /><br />Early on I was impressed. There are a number of scenes that accurately portray details of colonial life in America...The tar and feathering scene which disturbs so many reviewers here is actually tame compared to the historical reality of this brutal form of mob murder. The relationship between John and Abigail is consistent with the history I already knew, and other snippets seemed to jibe with events I had studied in depth before.<br /><br />However, as I continued to watch the series, I became increasingly troubled...this story did not seem to match up with my general understanding of Adams as a man who had substantially given up his personal life to help guide a new nation into being and sacrificed his chance at a second term as president in order to keep the newly independent nation out of a war with France that likely would have ended the US as a sovereign nation.<br /><br />The series drew me into the story of John Adams and lead me to read several other biographies of him, as well as other histories of the time. The positive is the series motivated me to learn much more about John Adams. The negative is that I have come to believe that HBO not only got it wrong, but got it wrong in grossly misleadingly ways.<br /><br />Of course all histories must be read with skepticism, and movies are even less trustworthy. Moreover, no one becomes an expert on any historical figure by simply reading a book, or even three on the subject. My list of books _to_ read on Adams remains longer than the list of books I have read. Perhaps, after more study, I will change my mind but for now I have to say that this HBO miniseries should be viewed for entertainment purposes only.ps, after more study, I will change my mind but for now I have to say that this HBO miniseries should be viewed for entertainment purposes only.
B002ZG983M|5.0|What do you get when you add super heroes, \\"The Professional\\", A little \\"Kill Bill\\", Some \\"Spiderman\\", and a ton of action? You get a kick-ass movie. \\"Kick-Ass\\" has all the qualities of a comic book heroe mixed in with a awsome action story. Chloe Grace Moertz is awsome. She reminds me of a young Natalie Portman. Trust me you will be seeing a lot of her in the future. Chloe carries every scene she's in and mixes action heroe with sweet little daddy's girl perfectly. I have seen a lot of comic book movies in my time and I have to say this is one of the best that I've seen. There is a whole lot of action and comedy to please just about anyone. I know that there are a lot of people out there that didn't like this movie, but that's hard to believe. If you loved \\"Kill Bill\\", or \\"The Professional\\", Your going to love this movie. There's all the action of \\"The Professional\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\", mixed in with a \\"Spiderman\\" type heroe. This is your typical loser gets the girl and saves the world. I think the characters are perfect for this film and if your like me your going to love this movie. I even hope to see the sequal. I would rather see the sequal to this movie than any of the other super heroe movies coming out this summer. That's how much I loved this movie.
0670022411|1.0|This book started out as engaging and interesting but went downhill fast. I got the impression that the author had decent bones of a story around a intelligent repressed witch, but the editors decided a Forbidden Love With Vampire theme would be more profitable. Huge disappointment in the end where it clearly sets up a book 2 rather than having an actual conclusion (you can do both, you know). I honestly felt cheated at the end. Harry Potter meets Twilight meets Outlander, but in the worst exploitative sense.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|\\"What if\\" is the 7th brand new studio album by American hard rock band \\"MR. Big\\"; the album marks the studio comeback of the original \\"MR. Big\\" line up, as well as being the band's first studio album in a decade. \\"MR Big\\" are once again singer Eric Martin, drummer Pat Torpey, virtuoso bassist Billy Sheehan and guitarist extraordinaire Paul Gilbert.<br /><br />It would be fair to say that since the late 80s \\"MR Big\\" have been renowned musically for both their melodies and groves as a result of the very original and diverse personalities of the members. So, the first thing one has to establish is that `What if' is a totally rocking album full of distorted guitar, loud and unconventional bass lines and drum patterns as well as Martin's characteristic vocals moving from Rock'n roll, to AOR, to Hard rock. On a personal level I do feel that on \\"What if\\" the band have managed to balance their melodic and groovy sides better than ever and the standout tracks come in plenty: the melodic/dramatic `Overtow', the potential hit \\"American Beauty\\", the clever \\"Once upon a time\\" and the reflective \\"Stranger in my life\\" all match \\"MR Big\\"s greatest past moments.<br /><br />One has to also recognize that the technical battles between guitar and bass (exchanging solos and riffs) have retuned on \\"What if\\", being such a big part of the early \\"MR Big\\" albums. For that matter, both the bassist and guitarist hold nothing back in terms of performance so you can expect loads of shredding solos and various guitar acrobatics.<br /><br />Overall a fresh and exciting sounding album by a band that has lost none of their spark, capable of standing up to their classic releases; a must for any fan of hard rock and 80s arena rock.

And, I don't mean the overriding theme of this album, either.  Choosing the best albums in this early stage is similar to the argument of greatest rock recordings: Beatles or Stones?  Bob's got 10.  Steel Pulse has got 5 and before we get to the end of the top 20 we have to include at one from Burning Spear,  Black Uhuru and UB40.<br /><br />The 6th greatest reggae album is SURVIVAL (1979), and the  first  album of his thematic apocalyptic trilogy.  But what distinguishes this album is, not only, is it an underrated gem but it continues to carry (and might I say, mightily and courageously) the message of personal liberation he began when he created EXODUS.<br /><br />Barely a couple of years after he returned from exile from The Bahamas and England from an assassin's bullet, Marley proclaimed to the highest powers at home in Jamaica as well as repressive governments around the world the singular message of Hope that would undermine and topple them.<br /><br />In EXODUS, like the Hebrew prophet of long days gone by, Marley proclaimed to the modern-day pharaohs that there's a \\"Natural Mystic\\" blowing through the air and that the \\"Exodus\\" was at-hand, a movement of Jah's people.  At the same time, blowing the ram's horn, he chanted to all oppressed, all over-worked/ underpaid, discriminated, humiliated and distressed that we'd be \\"Jammin'\\" in the name of the Lord and we'd better \\"Get Ready.\\"<br /><br />*****  ******  ******<br />\\"Every man got a right to decide his own destiny/<br />And in this judgment, there is no partiality/<br />So arm in arm with arms we'll fight this little struggle/<br />Cause that the only we can overcome our little trouble...\\"<br />---- \\"Zimbabwe\\"<br /><br />In SURVIVAL, the message of liberation is more descriptively defined.  \\"We are the children of the Rastaman/ We are the children of the Higher Man.\\"  In \\"Africa Unite,\\" and \\"Zimbabwe,\\" Marley directly pointed to the broad and specific autocratic regimes in the Motherland.<br /><br />Speaking about Zimbabwe, it's been long chronicled that Marley supported the newly minted government of Robert Mugabe.  Promises of democracy, promises of individual liberty and communal responsibility for the building of a new nation.  Colonial South Rhodesia, now The Republic of Zimbabwe.  New nation, new flag, new name.  Would Marley sing the praises of this nation's leadership today?<br /><br />But Marley also pointed directly to the mechanics of oppression, namely, among other things, the educational system.  In Babylon System, he sings:<br /><br />\\"The Babylon system is The Vampire...<br />Building Church and University/<br />Deceiving the people continually/<br />Graduating thieves and murders/<br />Sucking the blood of the sufferers.\\"<br /><br />This album is also unique in that this is the only album where there are no ballads, slow or mid-tempo, of any kind.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|I would say this is a must watch movie for anyone who has children in that 5-10 year old bracket. Mr. Brown loved his wife very much (7 kids in about 10 years.) His children are precocious and have been running off nannies. Finally the facially blemished Nanny McPhee shows up at their doorstop and takes charge of the household, using a certain amount of magic.<br /><br />Mr. Brown maintains his home because of money supplied by his wife's aunt. She insists he must marry by month's end or lose the money. So he contacts Mrs. Quickly, (this is another story where names have meanings) and asks her to marry him against his children's wishes.<br /><br />The children, who first view Nanny McPhee as an adversary, change their point of view to accept her. Emma Thompson stars in this movie as well as wrote the screen adaptation for herself (must be really getting tough to get roles). The acting was good and this is a movie adults can sit through and not get overly bored. This film might be interesting to show your kids right after they see Mary Poppins.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|Zombies... what can I say? They're the antithesis to the very best that humanity has to offer.     I recently rented the Romero trilogy: \\"Night of...\\", \\"Dawn of...\\" and \\"Day of...\\". They're classics-all of them. And working on many different levels, they offer insight into us: the human species. Almost every human characteristic is explored: cooperation, consumerism, hate, trust, race, stress, FEAR, leadership, ingenuity, hope, loss, paranoia, claustrophobia, political ideology, deprivation, deception, companionship, cunning, strength, DEATH, murder-the list is endless.     If we are all of these things, then what are Zombies? Our polar opposite?    And besides, aren't we all, at some point in our lives, forced to be a little bit of a mindless, all-consuming, walking-dead zombie.    Forget alldat vampire B.S.----ZOMBIES zwhere the party's at!      Anyway...    Frank Darabount is the main man behind \\"The Walking Dead\\". He was the director of \\"The Mist\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". There are plenty of parallels that can be made between his films and Romero's Trilogy-especially \\"The Mist\\". I suggest renting it.    I know nothing of the comic that inspires the show, but some day I will prob. enjoy reading it too.        If you like Romero and Darabount, especially Darabount, then you will LOVE this show. It's EXCELLENT!    Can't wait for Season 2.....    P.S. I bought the downloads. They look pretty good on my 37\\" LCD.
B002ZG994U|5.0|It is worth checking out if you are a fan of the T.V. show. There are some things that were changed from the original T.V. show to make it modern; in the original T.V. show, they were Vietnam vets charged with a crime that they didn't commit, they broke out of a military prison and lived in the underground world to help ordinary people with problems that no one could help them with.     In the movie \\"The A-Team\\", it kind of follows the T.V. show except that instead of being Vietnam vets, they are Desert Storm 2 vets (Iraq Vets), and in Iraq they work undercover to get $100 Billion dollars worth of Treasury plates so that American money could not be counterfeited; it turns out that the American government gave them to the Shah of Iran and after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, they went missing and now they believe that the insurgents would counterfeit the money to pay off people to join the raging insurgency, and now they think that they know where they are, and now it is the A-Team's job to get them back.      Once they get them back, they are set-up by a shady group of people; the leader is a guy who tells them that he works for the CIA, but it turns out that once the job is done and they are framed, he goes in hiding. No one can find him. The A-Team is disbanded and they are charged with murder of a superior officer and all four of them are sent to different super-maximum military prisons and all four of them are each given life sentences (Murdoch is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane).     Eventually, they all escape and get back together to find out who framed them, and now it is off to find the real culprit of the crime, and to find out who the mysterious man was who \\"working\\" for the CIA.     Now, what makes this movie is not just the action, it is the characters. B.A. Baracus, Face, Hannibal, and Murdoch. B.A. Baracus (Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson) does a pretty good job of playing B.A.; the attitude and everything; including his fear of flying and having to be knocked out before the flight begins, but no one can top Mr. T. He (Mr. T) did the character SO WELL in the original T.V. series he was pretty much remembered as B.A.     Face (Bradley Cooper) really pulled out the stops as Face. He is charming, a womanizer, and basically everything that Face was in the original T.V. series and more. He flirts with just about every woman and usually get's his way all the time.     Murdoch (Sharlto Copley) wow, this guy (like Mr. Cooper) really pulled out ALL the stops for Murdoch. For people that remember Murdoch from the T.V. show remember how CRAZY the character was and some of the CRAZY stuff he did on the show, he does it in this movie also; from flying a helicopter BEYOND the limits of not only physics, but also logic while keeping a \\"calm\\" attitude about it. Also, Murdoch is known for portraying people (living mostly) and pretends to know what he is doing; in this movie, he actually portrays a doctor trying to stitch up B.A. Baracus after he got shot....classic Murdoch.     Hannibal (Liam Neeson) Again, I felt that Liam did a really good job doing Hannibal; from the cigar-smoking to just about everything that people remember him from the T.V. show, Liam does it pretty much dead on and even some lines from the original T.V. show \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\".     Aside from the really cool action scenes, the excellent acting from all four of the A-Team guys, if you are a fan of the T.V. series, it is worth buying, or if you never watched or were too young to remember the T.V. show, it is worth a rental without having seen the T.V. show (if you haven't seen the T.V. show, I would watch the pilot episode and a couple of more after that, than watch the movie...again, this is just to find out about the characters, it's not mandatory, but it helps).     Happy Shopping!
B000VIJTVM|4.0|Ben Harper always makes fun and very listenable albums. This is no exception - in fact, if I could rate it 4.5 stars I would. What we have here is a more consistent sound without the genre-jumping of some of his other albums. He's got a laid back soul-rock groove going on here that I find very soul-soothing. However, while the album flows better than his other albums, it is missing just an ounce of the fun and energy of some of his other works. The end result, though, overcomes that factor (for the most part). Lifeline is a fine record - not an essential must-have, but solid all-around and certainly worthwhile. I would also note that this is an album that you need to own in full - the sum is greater than its parts. There's a couple of slight standouts like the fun groove of \\"In the Colors\\" and the energetic soul of \\"Put it on Me,\\" but even these tracks sound better when listened to in the context of the full album.

0142437611|5.0|The title of Saul Bellow's masterpiece, \\"Seize the day\\", is spoken by a character:<br /><br />\\"There is the present moment. The past is no good to us. The future is full of anxiety. Only the present is real - the here-and-now. Seize the day\\".<br /><br />The fact that he, who speaks this line, is a mystery in the novel adds a new dimension to what he said. This man is Dr. Tamkin, with whom the protagonist, Tommy Wilhelm, becomes close friends. The man could be a real psychologist, a charlatan or even a delusional person. But, still, his influence on the other is quite strong. He becomes the father figure to Tommy, since he is not n good terms with his real father.<br /><br />During the course of one day in which the action in the novel takes chance, Tommy will reconsider his life - but still, he may feel too restrained to change it. He lives in a hotel - so does his father, and Dr Tamkin. Trying to get a divorce and out of money, the only love he has is for his too kids who he hadn't see much lately. He felt in love with a girl sometime ago, but she quitted him since he couldn't get a divorce from his wife.<br /><br />Bellow gets us under Tommy's skin. His failures - as a Hollywood star, as a salesman, but also as a son and a father - is what guides the narrative. The more the protagonist tries to overcome his problems, the more buried in them he is. The only available possibility is to come to terms with - especially with his conscience.  Rarely do his actions and decisions seem to marry his desires and wishes.<br /><br />Published in 1956, this short novel is read in a continuous flow, since its prose is straight and, despite having psychologist as one of the main characters, Bellow never turns to psychological explanations. The characters are seen through their actions and philosophical shades. Dr Tamkin is more a philosopher than a psychologist, if he actually is such. \\"All creations are his just inheritance. You don't know what you've got within you. A person either creates or he destroys. There is no neutrality...\\"<br /><br />If, as Tommy puts it, `a man is only as good as what he loves', what good is he?

Or maybe, he is just a XX Century man - divided between his desires and his duties.o neutrality...\\"    If, as Tommy puts it, `a man is only as good as what he loves', what good is he?

B0038P9LTU|2.0|Having been left hanging on in quiet desperation for some four years, Rhapsody of Fire finally returned in 2010 to continue \\"The Dark secret saga\\", this being part 3. This particular story began in 2004 (when the band were simply known as Rhapsody) on the album \\"Symphony of Enchanted Lands II - The Dark Secret\\". It continued a couple of years later with \\"Triumph Or Agony\\", the first album released under the name Rhapsody of Fire.<br /><br />When we last heard of the quest of our heroes, they had found the black book written with the blood of angels which contains \\"The dark secret\\", an evil prophesy, and things seemed to be going rather well. Fortunately, this is not in fact the case, and the story must continue. The baddies here are the Disciples of the Black Order, who would very much like to get hold of the book and release Nekron's evil, which it contains. The antidote to all this turns out to be, wait for it, a white book(!) written by goodie Erian. Unfortunately, that book is not to hand, and hence another quest must be undertaken to get hold of it before the bad guys.<br /><br />Christopher Lee once again returns as narrator, the sleeve notes even containing a \\"costume credit\\" for him. He is joined by a number of other actors, including a return of the lovely Susannah York, who sadly died as I was writing this review in January 2011, playing Elion. While Lucca Turilli and Alex Staropoli dominate the song writing as usual, Fabio Lione also gets a credit this time.<br /><br />Musically, the time between the last release and this has been put to good use, the songs here being notably stronger than those on \\"Triumph or agony\\". Tracks such as \\"Reign of terror\\" take us back to the gloriously over the top choirs and orchestras of the good old days, while contrasting delightfully with the pixie folk of the following \\"Danza di fuoco e Ghiaccio\\". With lyrics alternating between English, Italian and possibly Latin, there is a naturally enforced diversity to the vocal styles too.<br /><br />While a couple of the tracks run to around 7 minutes, the feature track here is the 11 minute closing epic which bears the album's title.<br /><br />The closing words of the lyric sheet are \\"To be continued...\\", indicating that this saga is not yet complete. Indeed, the next full instalment is scheduled for release in Spring 2011.<br /><br />Once again, the album is presented with a superb booklet containing the story and the lyrics, the artwork being conceived by Turilli and Staropoli and realised by Felipe Machado Franco. The digipak version has two additional tracks. \\"Labyrinth of madness\\" opens with a wonderful guitar crescendo, this instrumental track being a vehicle for Luca Turilli to display his lead guitar dexterity. The other bonus track is an orchestral version of the song selected as a single from the album, \\"Sea of fate\\". This version is certainly different, being delivered as a majestic ballad.<br /><br />It is very easy with a band such as Rhapsody of Fire, to visit them superficially and then perceive them as a cheesy prog metal band. To do so is not only self defeating, it is disingenuous to the time and effort they put into crafting their product. The stories alone are works of art which may well at some stage be brought together as cohesive volumes. Admittedly not the stuff of Booker Prizes, but infinitely more readable and enjoyable. The music is composed and performed with great attention to detail, complex choral and orchestral arrangements being paired with supreme melodies and lyrics which complement the stories. The similarity of the albums is the band's strength, they offer a product of unwavering quality and pleasure.uple of the tracks run to around 7 minutes, the feature track here is the 11 minute closing epic which bears the album's title.     The closing words of the lyric sheet are \\"To be continued...\\", indicating that this saga is not yet complete. Indeed, the next full instalment is scheduled for release in Spring 2011.     Once again, the album is presented with a superb booklet containing the story and the lyrics, the artwork being conceived by Turilli and Staropoli and realised by Felipe Machado Franco.

B004LQI0HE|5.0|I JUST finished watching this movie and its beautiful. Its a topic I've seen in movies before but the way its carried out is so lovely. I'd read a synopsis and knew what would happen generally but none of that diminished what I felt watching the movie. Carey Mulligan is so stoic but lovely and you feel exactly what she's feeling every step of the film.
B000002JKA|5.0|Yet another masterpiece by DT. 'Awake' makes an impressive follow-up to the amazing 'Images & Words', mostly by showing off a different, more metallic approach to their signature prog metal sound. Generally speaking, the 'Awake' repertoire is fiercer and fierier than its predecessor's: the sound is more aggressive, the performances are penetrated by a harder edge, a big deal of the guitar riffs and solos are quite sombre, at times even openly belligerent. The more subdued role of Moore's keys (only two solos in the whole album) helps to decrease the symphonic splendour of 'I&W' in order to emphasize the overall heavy mood here. The first two tracks are clear manifestos of the refurbished thing that's gping on. Other massive examples are the incendiary duet 'The Mirror'/'Lie' and the stormy 'Scarred'. While the instrumentation provided by Petrucci, Myung and Moore is openly dark and heavy, Portnoy manages to create a clever counterbalnce by allowing his drumming to get quite loosened, at times leaning toward the cadence of jazz and funky, without losing a miligram of rock energy. His introductory rolls for '6:00' are simply masterful, and so is the fluid foundation he lays for 'The Mirror' / 'Lie' and 'Scarred' all thorughout its tempo shifts and varying motifs (a special mention for his input in the closing section of 'Scarred'). IMHO, it is the three-part suite 'A Mind Beside Itself' that shines as the most impressive gem in this album - its three successive sections really operate as separate tracks with their own respective artistic structures, yet they also manage to provide an amazing unitary whole. The pyrotechnical instrumental 'Erotomania' is a real disturbing musical journey thorugh an exciting diversity of motifs, which include appropriate anticipations of some lines from the following two sections; 'Voices' is a very inspired ode to the destructive drive of mental-emotional chaos, powerful without getting too speedy most of the time; ultimately, the last section 'The Silent Man' turns out to be a gentle, lyrical acoustic ballad that serves as a final serene relief. There are also softer tracks, such as 'Innocence faded' and 'Lifting Shadows off a Dream', that see DT making a stand between AOR and 90s Rush: these are highly melodic numbers, never getting mellow or \\"corny\\". The closure is definitely something to remember (it sounds in my head while I'm writing this) - 'Space-Dye Vest' is an awesome ambient-oriented ballad penned by Moore, in this way anticipating the Chroma Key stuff to some degree. Though it's not built upon a frantic tempo, its lyrics and mood are still emotionally violent: a brilliant ending for a brilliant album.section 'The Silent Man' turns out to be a gentle, lyrical acoustic ballad that serves as a final serene relief.

B001AX9DT0|4.0|What looks like Zack Galifinakis and sounds like Otis Redding? Ray LaMontagne. I recently got turned on to him and after this album, can't wait to pick up his other cds. \\"You Are The Best Thing\\" is a totally infectious, brassy ode to being in love. His voice is so soulful... highly recommended!
B003ZK58WM|2.0|Since \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is one of my favorite novels, I really looked forward to the publication of \\"Fall of Giants\\".  I did not object to the price of the Kindle edition.  For a book of that size I thought it was a great advantage to be able to read it on my iPad.  With a long trip planned over Thanksgiving, I downloaded it and began to read.  It starts out dramatically with the experience of a young Welsh boy, Billy, on is first day underground in the mines.  But pretty soon I found it was really dragging.  The characters just didn't seem to come alive for me.  I was a history major so I find historical novels interesting but somehow Follett has managed to make it dull.  Now its the end of February and I'm barely a quarter into it.  I can put it down for weeks, read 2 or 3 other books, and even forget that I have it.  I just couldn't find any reason to care about what happens to most of the characters and that's what keeps me reading a novel.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Good acting. Good story line.I like history so this movie held my interest.About the only thing I did not like about this movie was a reminder of how badly  we dressed back in the 70's.
1594202842|5.0|To start with - do not read this book as a parenting guide or even a suggestion of how to parent - it isn't and was never meant to be. It is, however, a direct and often funny - in a wry humor and pull no punches kind of way - recount of how a mother tried to raise her kids in the best way that she thought it should be done and how it worked out. As a mother, I often find myself wondering if the approaches I used for any given situation was the best, and it's refreshing to read about other mothers' struggles in the same respect.  I am Chinese and a mother and I don't agree with Amy's approach to parenting (I'd probably be labeled one of her \\"western mothers\\") but I understand where she's coming from in many instances and I agree with some of the premise behind her extreme style.      I do not feel that this book makes all Chinese parents suspect. If someone compared me to Amy, I'd ask them why they thought any race or group is only a homogenous blob that is represented by any one person's viewpoint.    Lighten up, read the book as a retelling of an experience and take the parenting technique discussion to a parenting forum.
089898890X|5.0|This book and CD break down the Bop techniques in a very simple and understandable manner.  As a new drummer I enjoy the various exercises and I am learning a great deal about the multitude of grooves noted in the book.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Along with a couple of other Blu-Rays I ordered this David Foster & Friends Blu-Ray as a present for my wife for our Anniversary, I knew she would like the song selections, of which there are many, this is a very good Blu-Ray, the quality is excellent, the picture great & the audio very good too, some may look at this & say who is David Foster, for those that don't know he is one amazingly talented guy who has written & produced so many songs you probably didn't realize, check out the song list & those of the artists that appear with him, its simply brillant!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray.
1400052173|4.0|I loved the story of Lacks family the most. The scientific part was written well and easy to understand without boring you. I have a lot of respect for the author for writing this book, because it doesn't seem like it was an easy story to tell. I also like that she investigated the story of Elsie Lacks too. It was a great, interesting read!
B001R60ESE|4.0|A present for my wife who adores not only many of the other songs & artists available to watch on this disc but is also a huge fan of Steven Tyler, as others have already rightly stated, this blu-Ray is worth the price just for the two Steven Tyler Songs alone, the one he sings to his Dad is very moving.
B000K7MMP4|5.0|This Pride and Prejudice movie has the best characterizations, I think, and is the most comic.  The Mr. Collins in this video is unmatched.  And Lady Catherine!  I smile just thinking about her.  The Elizabeth is perfect--young but poised, and with beautiful eyes.  And Darcy is wonderful--tall and handsome, but oh, so arrogant in the beginning.  I also love the Mrs. Bennett in this one.  She's is so foolish but still likable because she truly loves her daughters.  Even the sisters are portrayed to perfection.  If you haven't seen this one yet, you are in for a treat.
0316044695|5.0|I loved this book.  It is on the top of my list of favorite all time books.  A must read.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie as a child, and when I saw that it was available in a combo pack, I immediately knew I had to have it.  Beauty and the Beast never gets old, and despite all the remakes and spin-offs, the Disney version is still the best.  I bought the movie so that my son could watch it with me, and he loves it.  When I purchased, Amazon had a special for $10 off your entire purchase when you buy Beauty and the Beast and pre-order Tangled, which is a great deal!
0756405890|4.0|I read this book after hearing about it from Penny Arcade of all places.  While it certainly didn't blow me away, I was thoroughly charmed by the story.  For those who don't know, this is the first book in a planned fantasy trilogy centered around the autobiography of Kvothe, a(n) (in)famous magic user.      The High Points:    I really enjoyed some of the lyrical passages of the book.  Say what you will about structure, Rothfuss knows how to nail a particular description or detail in a way that sticks with you.  The individual set pieces of his scenes are quite good, along with a genuine sense of mystery.  The Chandrian in particular is suitably creepy, though I fear that like many other horrors it will become less impressive the more we learn about it.  Kvothe is a genuinely likeable narrator, willing to poke fun at himself and his flaws.  The magic system, or at least what has been revealed about it thus far, is rather novel and holds lots of promise for future adventures.    The Low Points:    Unfortunately the world of the story seems quite fuzzy at best.  While individual scenes are strong, they aren't strung together with much coherency.  There is a vibrant debate over whether or not Kvothe qualifies as a \\"Mary Sue\\" character, but his relationships to the other characters seemed to be rather poorly developed.  I hold out the hope that since the narrative covers Kvothe's childhood that as he matures things tend to take a more realistic shape.  The personal hero's journey owes much to Campbell and even more to Harry Potter, but that is not enough to sink the overall tone.    The Verdict:    The book is an easy read and great for a lazy weekend.  If you just finished reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" or \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" it might seem a little lacking by comparison, but the deft use of language and the sense of mystery ought to keep most readers turning pages until the wee hours.
B0015AARJI|5.0|As described by the seller. The product packaging and excellent new shows interest in the product. Glad to deal with the seller
081297381X|4.0|While I preferred Fooled By Randomness a bit more, this book is also excellent.  I've never met the author, but I suspect his humorous blend of arrogance, intelligence, and literary passion that ooze through the pages of FBR/BS directly reflects his personality. While I can see why he's made a lot of \\"enemies\\" in economic circles (he spares no fools, especially high profile ones), one has to admire Taleb's courage of conviction - and consistency of viewpoint (his much older material promotes similar themes).
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Brand new DVD for the final season of my husbands favorite show. I know he would recommend this to anyone who was interested.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|I've been exercising to techno, electro, trance type music for a few years but usually just got nibs off my sons mp3 downloads.  Lately I really needed some new exercise music and while I was searching I came across Deadmau5. I am so glad I discovered his music because I can't stop listening to it. I would love to see him live but I guess this will have to do.  Love the Ghosts stuff, FML, Strobe and the others. I just love his music.
0515123447|4.0|This is a great book and a great series.  Book was used but was in decent condition as advertised,  Got here in a reasonable amount of time.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|Great memories, got it for my birthday the year it came out.  You can hear the decline of the group in the music now.  Then, not so much.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I love this movie. It is my absolute favorite movie (along with Beauty and the Beast) and is what introduced me to PotO. The music, the visuals, GERARD...it's fabulous.<br /><br />Granted, there are some issues with lip synchronization and sound editing, and yes, they did change the original musical play. That's alright. This is the version for those of us who love the Phantom in all his glory.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I've watched every episode at least 5+ times with my bestie. It's the perfect show to brighten any day or a great one to have on the background while you're working. I can't wait for the DVDs to come out--I've been watching them via DVR and iTunes. Love PLL!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|My family really loved this movie we really enjoyed this film.I love a movie that has know bad words or nudity when Im watching it with my 8 year old buy this film you will love it also!!!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I was thrilled when I heard this movie was coming to the big screen. I've read a dozen books on Secretariat and this is a family-friendly film that'll make you cheer. Whether you like horses or not, it's one to watch.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|I won't go into a lengthy synopsis since others have done so, but I was very VERY pleasantly surprised at just how well put together and endearing this animated romp was. Particularly since I was terribly disappointed in Despicable Me and couldn't make it past 20 minutes in of Desp Me.    Much like The Incredibles it 'stars' a superhero (actually supervillain) and gives his history over the years, followed by a sequence of events which turns the tables on the situation. It even has a nerdy guy transformed into a superpowered villain to battle our protagonist ala Incredibles.    Not since The Incredibles has a movie found the right mix of hilarity coupled with exciting action  which has you wondering \\"how is this thing gonna turn out?\\".  I found myself really caring about the characters and this has certainly never been true with a Dreamworks animated feature before.    Great Flic!!    The 'Button of Doom' feature is a 15 minute short on a separate DVD. Chronologically it takes place just after the end of the full feature. If you are like me and want more Megamind it's worth the extra sheckels. The quality of the production is identical to the 'big feature' and is just as funny and exciting.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Extremely CUTE! What an adorable little guy. It's more of a collectible than a toy. However, it can get annoying real quick.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|I saw this movie last night and am still in awe at what the space program has done and also how IMAX filmed this incredible movie.  I worked for NASA during the development of Hubble and felt pride (and goosebumps) seeing it put into place in this film. Amazing to witness and see the stress on the astronaut's faces as they were being dressed in their flightsuits just a few hours from liftoff.       It also left me a little sad that we're so blessed to live on such a beautiful, miraculous planet and to know how society (and terrorists) are trying its best to ruin life on this planet Earth.      I've just ordered my copy; can't wait to share it with family and friends.
0525421580|2.0|Please note that this is a re-written review from one I originally wrote a month ago which was simple and very brief.  Someone made a negative comment which was totally not warranted as I made no disparaging remarks about the book.  I notice though that from time to time some people will make assumptions about a low review.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and this is simply how my son felt.  As I state in the title, this book is not for everyone.  That does not say whether or not it's a well written book, but only that in this particular instance, someone did not care to read it because he was uncomfortable with some of its contents.  My 14 year old son is an avid reader.  He sometimes gets stumped finding books to read so I'm always researching the internet looking for highly rated books for him to read.  That said, he doesn't always like what I find, but he generally enjoys about 80% of what I suggest.  That said, I read the reviews on this book and since it was highly rated and it seemed like an interesting book I got it for my son.  Now before anyone gets offended, my son has been raised as a caring, compassionate and open minded individual.  After a couple of chapters, he decided that he did not want to read the rest because he felt uncomfortable that there were references to gay sexuality with one boy talking about his kissing a boyfriend.    Clearly as a parent, you know your child better than anyone and should know how they would feel reading a book that has any same sex commentaries in it.  I thought I read enough reviews to make an informed decision for my 14 year old but I did realize that there would be any reference regarding same sex intimacies.  This could be a great read for others but as I stated earlier, this is not for everyone.
B0034K2DM6|3.0|I read the book and I was interested to see what voices they would use. It was good but not great and they left out about three chapters that I thought were the best chapters. Big let down. Get the book you'll thank me later!
0452295548|5.0|My wife suffered a ruptured brain aneurism on Dec. 14, 2010. She  recovered completely from her brain injury in less than in less than two months thanks in no small part to the advice and counsel provided in \\"My Insightful Stroke\\" The book is spectacular in many respects including literary merit (descriptions of the authors personal experience of her stroke and the road to recovery are truly vivid and moving) scientific accuracy and compassionate attitude. I can not recommend it too highly for stroke victims or their care givers.  \\"Read it, you'll love it\\"
B004LQGXPA|1.0|Rented the movie via instant viewing and the frequent streaming interruptions ruined the experience.<br /><br />Oh well, live and learn.
0446569895|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.  As a teenager in the 80's of course I knew of Ozzy Osbourne.  I would never call myself a big fan of him or Black Sabbath. I listened to some of their songs but never really considered myself a \\"metal head\\".  I did watch the first season of The Osbournes when it came out on MTV.  Watching Ozzy is a little bit like watching a train wreck.  You know it is wrong because it is obvious that he is in a bad place, yet you simply cannot turn your head.  Here is the reality - none of us are perfect so we might as well quit pretending along that line.  Reading this book is like hearing Ozzy talk in your head.  His ghost writer did an excellent job of keeping Ozzy's \\"voice\\".  There were many times where I laughed out loud reading this book.  His expressions are just that funny.  Beyond that, Ozzy is the first to admit the incredibly stupid things he has done.  He is not proud of any of it yet he never tries to glorify or justify the bad decisions he made.  He just tells it like it is.  Oh, by the way, if you are offended by profanity you do not want to read this book.  You won't make it through a paragraph without some multiple f-bombs.  Somehow on Ozzy...it just works.
1401324029|3.0|Because these books are based on the TV Series, I feel I must begin with the fact that I very much enjoyed Season 1 of Castle.  I thought the opening of each episode was very artful and interesting with the staging of the murders set to music.  It really made me feel Nikki's reaction and passion for every crime.  Then the book came out, and the characters' passion and banter were of the same high caliber, which I thought Heat Wave captured extremely well.     Naked Heat, not so much.  It's as though they got so excited by their success that they just slapped a plot together, which again (sadly this time) mimics the series.  I was so sure that Kate's mother's murder was going to be a through-line for the season, and it just...ended.  The same sort of thing happened in the Naked Heat.  Nikki was mad at Rook for the article...for about 3 seconds...and then sleeps with him again!  All through the book we are faced with Rook's childlike unwillingness to admit or fix his wrongs, perfering to smooth his errors with platitudes and gifts instead, thereby leaving this reader with a vague feeling of ickiness about Nikki allowing this guy back into her life.  The whole series became more and more vanilla, losing the edge that had really grabbed me in the first place.  It's as though the characters were not allowed to follow the paths their marvelous creators' (the actors) instinctual choices would have made, which left this series and book with no real stakes.        Isn't it ironic that I place the blame for that solely on the writing?
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Yeah, sure these are outtakes, but they are great songs nonetheless!  For those of you who say they are uninspired, dull or lacking quality, you can't possibly be listening to the songs on these two disks.
B003B02O14|4.0|This book was very interesting like Grisham always is but I felt that sometimes, it was hard to keep up with. But overall, its worth the money.
0307388921|5.0|First off, I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of Palahniuk's novels, and this one comes in a close second right after Fight Club. Let it be warned that those who do not have the social satire and stomach to handle such raunchy, beautiful situations and philosophy should just turn away from this book right now, because it isn't for you. This novel sheds light on some hard hitting areas in our life, and provides a perfect satirical and narcissistic example of such. I find this book absolutely brilliant and it sure as hell doesn't hold back on what it wants said. In a world full of conformity and censorship to the mass public, this book stands out and tells you what it really is, directly in your face.
B004MMEIK0|3.0|This is a lighthearted romp through the problems of being a vampire.  The characters are loveable and the story develops with a variety of twists and turns that keeps you wondering how the hero will survive and win the love of his lady.
0385341679|5.0|Finally, the answers we've been waiting for BUT ...still want more in the series!  Great read, now will go back to the beginning & read it again!
B003XU02QG|2.0|When I saw the UK Film Commission scroll by on opening credits I feared I was in for a multicultural debacle like the BBC Robin Hood series and I was unfortunately not mistaken. Apart from the silly casting theres really not much character to the film to make it exciting. The early battle scenes and the scenery are enjoyable but overall Id say this film is a $1 red box rental at best. If you want a mindless fun period movie in recent releases Id say Outlander is a better bet. Its silly but more enjoyable to watch than Centurion.  My buddies warned me Centurion was a one buck movie, next time I'll listen.
1932100660|5.0|This is a must read book for every body, this book explains complex subjects in a way that everybody can understand. Also this book give consistent explanations why you should  consider become a vegetarian, and I my self bean a vegan for more than 9 years can agree that if you choose to change your diet you won't regret it. I'm 51 and never feel so great. I have so much energy and a good health  than when I was in my twenties.  Very, very good book, thanks to this kind of books,one can be aware of so many sickness and knowing that the remedy for all of them is just DIET! What else can anybody wants that avoid doctors and their treatments that just put you in worst conditions than the sickness itself. If some one want to be healthy Just give a good diet a chance! and please read this book.
0316044695|5.0|First off I would like to say Lone Survivor was an exelent book. I bought this book when it first hit the stores and havent read it since recently. I regret that. If you want a good read this book is great.    I was reading a few bad comments about this book and I came to a conclusion. Most of those comments were from men in the Army. I was really suprized that a brach that isn't specialy trained or can't hold their own without the USMC helping them can talk about a Navy SEAL. I would like to know what these guys would say about Richard Marcinco, a flawless SEAL as well. The SEALs are a special operations branch for CT. Marcus tell his story because the men, his best friends, died in combat and like most who do, never get notice from the public.    Lutrell is a warrior and a hero. He should be seen as such. Not hated by some pencil-pusher who has all the time in the world to just read books and comment when he could be training and getting his men to learn how to pull the trigger when the time is right.   I stongly recommend this book to any millitary lovers.
B003UESJH4|4.0|The plot isn't much; a rather controversial 'speech therapist' Lionel Logue helps King George IV overcome his stutter in time to address the public in his most important speech as King but what made this film so good was the dynamic relationship between Lionel and \\"Bertie\\" and the characterization of both men. It was a very heartwarming, inspirational and on occasion, funny film that lets the public into the private life of a prince who experienced an emotionally difficult upbringing and the determination with which he overcame it.
B00275EGX8|5.0|This movie is superb, I don't know why it is only rated three stars. This is probably the best movie the year it came out, gotta be up there in best military/war movies too.
B004HO6HYI|2.0|*SPOILER*<br /><br />John Smith is the 4th of only 9 \\"gifted\\" survivors from the planet Lorien. Mogadorians killed the 3rd survivor, now it is his time. Can John Smith and his guardian warrior Henri join forces with the other survivors in order to save Earth?<br /><br />\\"I Am Number Four\\" has a decent central plot. However, the film deals with it awfully, failing to establish various aspects of the plot like; why are the Mogadorians so intent on killing the last 9? What exactly are Lorien superpowers? And what exactly are these aliens? The lack of detail between the history of these 2 species really bothered me as while I was watching the film, all these questions were popping up in my head that were only being partially answered through the dialogue/narration in the film as opposed to actual action sequences of the war. The director could have taken it to another level here but took the easy way out which really took away from the interest and depth of the story.<br /><br />Now onto the subplot. The subplot is essentially the cliche romantic triangle between John, Sarah and her popular ex boyfriend Mark who instantly becomes his enemy. The subplot is rather contrived and implausible. Paraphrasing from film dialogue; after Sarah breaks off the relationship with Mark, Mark convinces the school that Sarah is a bitch, turning her into a social outcast. Therefore enabling Sarah to reflect and find herself through photography. John is touched by her inner turmoil and they spend the middle of the film engaging in meaningful gazing and pointless dialogue \\"your hands are warm\\", with the central plot basically put on the back burner. With this film, the central and subplot are like 2 completely separate films. They are not woven together at all. Note how the Mogadorians are conveniently absent for a good couple of weeks to allow Mark and Sarah to hit off whereas in the beginning of the film, they appear to be right on John and Henri's trail.<br /><br />During this time, John also manages to befriend Sam who's father knew about Loriens and Mogadorians but has been missing for years. Again, it is highly implausible that a human would know of their existence let alone have his son befriend a Lorien and the film does not explain what happened to Sam's father despite a montage of Henri investigating his father's history. The father is one of the film's many plot devices that lead nowhere and are basically a waste of time.<br /><br />Then one night, the Mogs manage to track John, Sarah and Sam but only after Mark reveals their location... but if the Mogs can track John from Hawaii (or wherever he was) to Ohio simply by sniffing a piece of cloth, surely they don't need to ask where he is if they are in the same town... Anyway, John and his friends are then surrounded by the Mogs and their creatures (again unexplained) facing certain death when suddenly, a jaded biker chick (number 6) steps in to save the day... along with John's dog which is now apparently a chimera.

Again, it is highly implausible that a human would know of their existence let alone have his son befriend a Lorien and the film does not explain what happened to Sam's father despite a montage of Henri investigating his father's history. The father is one of the film's many plot devices that lead nowhere and are basically a waste of time.    Then one night, the Mogs manage to track John, Sarah and Sam but only after Mark reveals their location... but if the Mogs can track John from Hawaii (or wherever he was) to Ohio simply by sniffing a piece of cloth, surely they don't need to ask where he is if they are in the same town... Anyway, John and his friends are then surrounded by the Mogs and their creatures (again unexplained) facing certain death when suddenly, a jaded biker chick (number 6) steps in to save the day... along with John's dog which is now apparently a chimera. A not so epic laser shootout ensures and the hero and heroine drive off into the sunrise.    In my opinion, they could have cut out the romance thing and replaced it with a more indepth/visual view of the Lorien/Mogadorian history and also focus more on the cat and mouse dynamic between them as they move from city to city and cut out the scenes that lead nowhere.     Disappointing film in my opinion. The dialogue was boring, special effects were too fake looking (light shining out of John's palms???), too many parts of the plot were left unexplained or underdeveloped and the romantic subplot was too long, contrived and did not serve the central plot at all.

B000000OAA|4.0|On their third album, Sheer Heart Attack, Queen had found their sound. The songs overall are stronger and more memorable than on their first two releases as they found a balance between Brian May's guitar theatrics and Freddie Mercury's flair for the dramatic. Nowhere is this more evident than on the band's first U.S. hit single &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, which boasts a memorable chorus and their now famous multi-tracked backing vocals to go with May's singable guitar lines and Mercury's clever lyrics. &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; finds May in pure guitar hero mode and would be a concert staple for many years. &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; is Queen at their heaviest and as expected, May tears it up on this one. &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; is another classic tune that starts with more theatrics before becoming a swinging rock number. As on their next album, A Night at the Opera, there are tunes that blend directly into the next giving the feel of a suite (ex...&quot;Tenement Funster&quot; into &quot;Flick of the Wrist&quot;). The track &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; is one of several vaudeville tunes that they did so well. The only thing that stops Sheer Heart Attack from becoming a classic is that a few of the songs like &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; and especially &quot;Misfire&quot; feel incomplete and that's a shame on the latter since it's great while it lasts. All told, this is the first of a long winning streak for Queen and is one of their better albums.
0385495323|5.0|This was a great book. Starting with Mary Queen of Scots and ending with quantum computing, I enjoyed every section. I was glad that Singh included some of the more technical aspects in the appendices - no way I could read about the one-way functions behind RSA without seeing them and working through a couple. I wish I had read this book when it came out ten years ago!
B000069HJM|4.0|I had this album on vinyl when it first came out, and was quite disappointed by it.  In fact I have only just replaced it, having not heard it for many years, and mostly just to complete the collection.    I am, however, very glad I've re-visited it, because it's an awful lot better than I remember.  I am a huge Supertramp fan, and have loved just about everything they've done.  I would have, until recently, qualified that statement with this album being the exception.    I don't whether the re-mastering has made the difference, or something else, but I am now very impressed with it.  It has a really 'groovy' sound throughout, and that's not a oft used description of Supertramp albums.  This one has such a buzz.  The musicanship of course is exemplary, but that's what you'd expect.      I think the problem originally for me  was the almost over-produced type of sound of the album, which was perhaps fitting for the time, but didn't seem particularly fitting to Supertramp.  It may be that the re-mastering has addressed that to some extent.    It isn't Supertramp as we know it, but is is Supertramp doing what they do.  Making great music, and making each album different from anything else.  I urge any Supertramp fan to give it a go, or at least, another go.

1589795474|5.0|The greatest merit for this book is that it is based on actual data from real people with real assets to show. Unlike most of the other financial books, this one has greater objectivity because of its reliance on surveys and data to reach its conclusions. The author's only conflict of interest is to sell more books - other than that there are no shameless advertisements for seminars or websites in the book.    Like others have stated, this book reinforces principles that other books have reinforced, with \\"pay yourself first\\" ranking high on the list. The book doesn't try to be a how-to manual on becoming wealthy and it doesn't abuse catchy slogans; it simply presents facts about the surveys conducted and draws conclusions on those facts. For this reason, the book is providing a great service.    I was a bit shocked when I read the equation for computing net worth (1/10*your age*your annual salary = what your net worth should be) and did it for myself. I hold a graduate degree and I've been in the work force for 5 years. During this time I have been working dilligently to overcome my distinct disadvantage of arriving late to the workforce with a school loan and a mortgage weighing down my net worth from Day 1. For that reason I'm nowhere near where this equation says I should be. I would guess that since the median age of the Stanley and Danko survey participants is in the mid 50's, perhaps by the time I reach that age I will have caught up. To confirm that, I did some calculations. I used my current salary and age and projected future earnings using an assumed percentage for annual increases in salary, and then used that formula to project my future net worth. This curve is what I should be according to the authors. I then projected my actual net worth from the present value, with estimates on how much of my income I can save and a range of simple interest rates on those earnings. My present actual net worth starts well below the projected target, but depending on how dilligent I am with saving and reducing monthly costs, my projected net worth has potential to climb at a sharper upward slope and the two would intersect sometime in the future (approximately 10 years from now, by my guesses with some aggressive saving schemes). Consequently, if I were to aggressively pursue savings this way, by the time I pass the age of 55 I would meet the Stanley and Danko definition of a Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW).  Any time before that, however, I would be called an Underaccumulator of Wealth (UAW) by this loose definition.    I would imagine most people who intend to be a PAW would face a similar challenges early in life. From this little study, it would seem to me that you can define yourself as an UAW or a PAW depending not on how far above or below you are from the targeted net worth, but the slope of your net worth growth curve. If your net worth is below the target value and the slope is the same, you will remain a UAW. If your net worth is below the target but is increasing at a higher slope, you are already living like a PAW and you will someday exceed the average net worth value for your age group. My concern isn't so much whether I get a PAW or UAW grade - I just want to achieve a level of financial comfort that will enable me to sieze opportunities as they come to me, and I want to do it sooner rather than later. I think that is the point of The Millionaire Next Door.    Also I should note that I performed a sensitivity analysis on the factors that affected my growth in net worth using the scenarios described above. The number one positive factor contributing to growth in net worth: average annual interest rate on saved dollars. The second and third sensitivity factors are both negative, and they are: monthly costs and tax rate. However, the magnitude of the interest rate factor is significantly larger than these two negative drivers. So the moral of the story is: save your money, maximize interest on that money, reduce your monthly costs and save the savings, and find ways to shelter your savings from taxes when you can.  If somebody simply told you that, you'd probably say \\"duh\\". But it's nice to see it quantitatively addressed. I credit the information in the book for helping me look at my own finances this way, and I expect that anyone else who is looking for some guiding principles to achieve financial independence will appreciate it as well.     Another note from the book - the authors point out that even the extrememly wealthy pay only a small percentage of their total net worth in taxes and this isn't accomplished through loopholes. It is small simply because their average annual incomes aren't impressively large but their savings are substantial, so their income tax rate (say ~30%) of their annual income is tiny compared to the pile of money they have sitting in their home, business, retirement accounts, pensions, and other investments.  Therefore the message is that people need not freak out if \\"taxing the wealthy\\" is part of the political agenda. If they've put their money in tax advantaged investments as simple as a 401k or a business, they will have sheltered most of their income from these taxes, and when they withdraw the money later in life they will still be paying single percentages of their wealth in taxes depsite falling in the same tax brackets as everyone else.  The \\"tax the wealthy\\" mantra is mislabeled as the book points out, because those who would be hurt most by these tax rates are those with high income but low wealth (low net worth). I appreciate that this book is simply illustrating that accumulating wealth is dead simple: don't blow all your money like you're going to die tomorrow. Live well and save the rest.  What you consider to be \\"well\\" is relative, and that's why people with moderate incomes can be millionaires.
030745455X|5.0|I enjoyed THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO and THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST, but the middle book is the best one I think. DRAGON TATTOO is a contained serial killer story that's ending is not entirely satisfying as it becomes cliched. PLAYED WITH FIRE opens up a large can of worms as it takes apart Lisbeth's backstory and you see just how far up the line it goes. HORNET'S NEST does get going after a time, but I found it full of exposition and liked the ease of the adventure in FIRE best of all.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I was impressed by the solid and objective journalism of this book.  If you are a medical professional, you should get acquainted with his research.  If you are interested in weight loss, this book contains the  background research you need to do in order to go forward with a plan.  The last third of the book also gives some practical guidelines for getting started.  The appendix contains some more specific information for losing weight.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|For M Night Shyamalan this movie was a break through after all those horrible movies.  This is a well above average movie that delivers the goods in terms of suspense, horror, anxiety, terror and surprises.  The actors, though none of them big names, well maybe Jenny O'Hare, play their part to perfection and the director really captures the impending sense of doom and chaos.  A very original story as well as being well written lock the audience in and keep them on the edge of your seat.  What really helps the story along is once you think you figured out who the \\"DEVIL\\" is, you tend to forget on little piece of information, but I will not give that away.  It also interwines a variety of story lines very well which culminate at the end of the movie.  The movie comes at you from all directions, but keeping the focus on the events which are happening and not forgetting where the action truly is.  For a movie which features the Devil himself, the kills/death/gore are not too over the top but definetly not recommended for children.  The ending is just as good and not as predictable as you think and the narrator of the tale, which he was told as a child, reminds you and assures you, though the Devil may be here, remeber GOD is too.  This movie is well worth watching!!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|My wife and I saw this movie twice at the theater(one time on an IMax screen) before it was released to Blu-ray.  We had to have in our library.  It is a great story of guts, honesty about ones-self, and about defying the odds.  The additional information did tell that the story was not exact, but that it did portray the true story of an amazing horse and his owner.  I would recommend Secretariat to anyone who loves really good feel-good movies that are pretty historically accurate.

B0034G4P7G|1.0|The Social Network was a real disappointment.  It's difficult to imagine what sort of Academy Award it might merit.  Perhaps younger viewers would be amused at the undergraduate drinking and horsing around, but their grandparents may well sleep through this video--and not miss a thing!

In short, if you're not updating your Facebook page several times per day, you probably won't see much of interest in this video.

0071752854|5.0|The book of the week was Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff. Wow. I haven't been this excited about a book in quite some time. I have found myself talking about this book a lot this week. I have even suggested it to several of my friends that sell for a living and I did so without getting to the end yet. Klaff is a dynamic writer and the whole book is fascinating. I have read a ton of books and what I look for in books anymore is uniqueness... A lot of books overlap ideas when you get into the realm of business and leadership. The books that do well nowadays are the ones that have a few individual revelations. The ones that do great are the ones that completely revolutionize their subject matter. Pitch Anything is one of those books.<br /><br />There are a lot of \\"Oh wow\\" ideas in this book. Klaff uses neuroscience in selling. He has analyzed the way the human mind reacts to communication and teaches best practices for selling. There are two things I want to lay on you that I learned from this book. The first about attention and the second is about neediness.<br /><br />Obviously it's important to get attention when you are selling to someone. This is obvious, but most people don't know how to get that attention. A lot of salesmen may think they do, but a lot are wrong. Attention is the combination of two things: desire and tension. Not only do you need to have someone interested but you also need them thinking that it's going to be on your terms whether they get it or not and they would be lucky to have it. Desire is the easy thing. You have a great product or service and you pitch how wonderful it is to your customer or financier. You are most likely passionate about what you are selling, so it should be easy to find ways to incorporate the other party into that desire. Klaff talks more in depth about the ways to really drive in this desire as well. The desire releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, this is half of the cognitive cocktail you're after. Tension on the other hand is not as easy to create. You have to push and pull while you are pitching. \\"I'm not sure if we are the right fit\\" *Pause* \\"But then again if things do work out, this could really be something great.\\" This is a low-key example. The first statement pushes them and mentally they are thinking, \\"Wait, what, why can't I have this\\" and then you pull them in with your second statement. Be convincing while you are doing you pushes and pulls or they won't work. And if you pull it off you will release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. This is the second half of the cognitive cocktail. It makes them pumped to want what you are selling. Dopamine is the chemical in the brain that chases rewards and norepinephrine is the chemical that helps your brain stay focused. If you are able to learn to communicate in a way the releases both of these in the person you are talking to, you need to learn it!<br /><br />The second thing I really liked was Klaff talking about not being needy. If you appear needy it gives the other party all the power. You want to have the power in your pitch. It is incredibly common for salesman to do everything but beg (maybe some beg too) to get the sale. And you probably do \\"need\\" it... or at least you think you do, but do not wear that on your sleeve. I read an article a couple years ago about the best sales people in the nation. There was a Car Salesman that sold more cars than anyone else and the way he did it was act like it was no sweat off his back if they didn't buy the vehicle. It was his propensity to avoid neediness that really sold his cars. Needy doesn't work. Keep the control and maintain utter confidence.<br /><br />This book is very interesting. I could spill tidbits I learned all night long, but I don't have the time. Instead, I encourage you to pick this book up. It is incredibly interesting. And if you are sitting there saying that you don't sell... you're wrong. Everyone sells. It may not be your main career, but whether you areasking for a raise at your job or even interviewing for a job, you are trying to sell yourself. As always, if you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.r even interviewing for a job, you are trying to sell yourself.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished this book, and wow. It really draws you in from the beginning (and I'm 27 - how is this a children's book?). I'm glad I had a relatively free weekend to finish it, or I would have been really exhausted at work! Fantastic, and I can't wait to finish the trilogy. It reminds me vaguely of Ender's Game, so I suspect if you enjoyed that book you would enjoy this as well.

B003UESJHO|5.0|I saw this movie after it received great recognition in award ceremonies. I normally don't like movies that get a lot of awards. Most of them are out right weird for me. Fighter is very different. The movie pulls you in the story right from the start. Christian Bale has done an awesome job in portraying a pot addict. As always Amy Adams is wonderful. I love the family ties in the movie along with the humor. At the end of the movie the real characters are shown.. That's when I truly appreciated how close the reel life was to real life. All the actors have done an awesome job. Perfect movie about family who sticks together through thick and thin. Must watch according to me. Enjoy!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I'm a big Austen fan and saw this version before I read the book.  I agree the book's ending is better but I still love the movie and it makes you appreciate the book more.   But this movie makes the story more accessible like the newest remake of Pride and Prejudice.  We could have seen Anne blossom more as she does in the book through the summer but a great fun adaptation with great actors.
0762761296|1.0|the book is complete fraud, claiming that it is a true story. the author was never in a Siberian camp. Google his name. he was a prisoner of war, but was in a jail near Moscow, then he was pardoned and freed in 1942 and went back to his troops.  The story is for those who do not question what they read. It is physically impossible to cross a desert without having water for weeks. they would be dehydrated and burnt by the sun to death. it is impossible to run in a deep Siberian snow 40 km a day. it is impossible to make a hole with a log in the river Lena ice- in April ice in the river Lena is 6 feet deep. it is impossible to squeeze water out of a coat after falling under the ice and it is impossible to put this coat back on yourself and run in this coat- it would be frozen solid like a tin. there are NO blooming cherry and apricot trees in Siberia in May!!!!  Seeing a Yetti is the most truthful part of the story. LOL.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I found this book to be extremely interesting.  Gladwell shows how our success is built on more than just our efforts alone.  The &#34;coincidences&#34; of time and place, family history, and smarts proves this book to be read that hooks you.  To me it proves that God has a huge hand in this world.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|At one point I was thinking if they ever done a show on the Terminator series how would they go about doing one?  Then comes 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles' and that question was answered.  Though with the recent movie being Terminator 3, the thought of the writing or anything like how that movie was done was in the back of my mind hoping that the show wouldn't be like how that movie turned out.  Surprisingly after nine episodes of the first season I was like this has to be one of the best shows out there and more interesting than most shows especially when it comes to any live action show out there these days.<br /><br />The 'Pilot' episode was well done and it was like 'WOW!  This show definitely has promise and FOX would have to be idiots to screw it up.'.  Each episode it tells about how Sarah and John are trying to find a way to keep Skynet from being built however they can go about doing so.  In the process they find out the machines are back and making their fight that much more important as an attempt to stop Judgment Day from happening.  The premise is similar to that of the second film where there's one 'Terminator' sent back to kill John and one to protect him, but that's not all.  When being taken to the year 2007 they soon find out there's a 'Terminator' with a specific mission to carry out to help Skynet be ready for when the war starts.  It's interesting to see that they make nods to the first two movies like 'Cameron' for example named after 'James Cameron' along with other things.<br /><br />Sure that this season is only nine episodes long not as long as other shows like this, but long enough to get a story going to set itself up for a second season, which that was longer.  All in all only nine episodes I want to say that they were good, almost perfect possibly, but that's only me.  One of the things is that the episode 'Demon Hand' does have a extended cut of the episode with this release.  Overall I give Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1, 4 stars out of 5.4 stars out of 5.

0691142165|4.0|Any review of this book would have to start out with who exactly the intended audience is. This is due to the rather schizophrenic marketing campaign surrounding the book. In marketing material sent out to Economics Departments the book was explicitly described as being geared to upper level undergraduates. To the general public (i.e., advertisements in the popular business press and bookstores) the book was instead promoted as being geared to the general layman. Considering the degree of technical discussion in the book (i.e., t-statistics, variety of other statistical tests, etc.) the latter is rather disingenuous on the part of the publisher, Princeton University Press. However, it should be stressed, that even though a good knowledge of statistical analysis and economic history is needed to understand everything presented in the book, in depth, the author does lead the reader enough by the hand so that the layman can follow. It is just that the layman will not understand or appreciate the content to the extent that an upper level Economics undergraduate or graduate student would. For the sophisticated layman (someone who is very knowledgeable on financial markets as opposed to Economics or Finance majors), this book would be a four star, for the serious economics student a five star.<br /><br />The book examines a number of financial crises (i.e., sovereign debt, banking, etc.) with sophisticated econometric techniques and determines the length of their after effects. The authors conclude some crises are more serious (i.e., systemic banking crises) than others in terms of their impacts on GDP and the period it takes the economy  to get back to its pre-crisis levels. It does this not only over \\"types\\" of financial/economic crises but over different time periods and across many different nations (not only \\"developed\\" nations, as so many other comparative studies have done in the past, but also across less developed nations). In this it excels.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book does not have weaknesses. A major one, one that the authors themselves admit, as stated above, is the fact that much of the data, even for the recent past (surprisingly) leaves much to be desired. Data on sovereign debt for many nations, for example, is very difficult to come by or estimate. Another problem, unfortunately one that the authors do address or examine, is the fact that there can be crises of the same type (i.e., systemic banking) that do vary considerably in terms of economic and financial impacts (i.e., S&L Loan crisis of the 1980s and the \\"crash\\" of the late 2000s). The authors lump these together and do not differentiate enough between them.  One last major problem involves the issue of causality. Debt (sovereign or private) is usually the main culprit but there is no analysis as to why or this debt has accumulated for the various crises. The reader usually does not know whether it is excessive government spending or an explosion of private sector debt, never mind the factors behind this accumulation (i.e., leverage and collaterization in the case of private sector debt).  Despite these weaknesses, the book still makes for an excellent read.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|The unsettling tale of a good man turned bad out of desperation to not leave his family with mountains of debt. What's the solution? Open a meth lab with one of his old students and proceed down the dangerous path of operating with criminals and their drug lord overseers. To complicate matters his brother-in-law is with the DEA, his wife is pregnant and his teenage son has cerebral palsy. There's a lot of humor interwoven with the more serious themes which I can understand or this would be unwatchable. The emotional arc of the main character, a borderline genius, is one of the more refreshing elements to watch. Think from caterpillar to butterfly (but in a bad way). Good to great supporting cast (Hank is the best). For the second season there aren't as many clever uses of chemistry which drops this down from B plus to A minus to B plus. More focus on the personal relationships of character.  It has won several Emmies since 2008, including PeaBody Award (2008) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (2010). CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; HUMOR: B plus; CHEMISTRY USES: B; WHEN WATCHED: January to February 2011; MY GRADE: B plus.
B004G600A4|5.0|When I saw a trailer for this movie, I had the overwhelming feeling that I would really like it.  Sometimes, when you see movie trailers, the movie will look good, but, you end up being disappointed after you see it.  That wasn't the case, for me, with this movie.  The characters were very colorful and full of life.  It was an interesting, humorous take on the classic story of Rapunzel.  It is also obvious from the DVD cover picture that it had the kind of humor that I love.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen Brothers have done it again!  What a great film!  No wonder it was nominated for 2 Academy Awards (Screenplay & Cinematography).  It plays out kinda like a hillbilly bluegrass Three Stooges episode.  No foolin'.  George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are superbly cast in this funny but meaningful look at life in the South.  The soundtrack had me knee-slapping and the song \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" by the Soggy Bottom Boys is worth a Grammy (if it hasn't already earned one).  And, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention John Goodman's brief appearance as a Bible salesman...priceless.  I've never seen Clooney in such an offbeat role.  It may be his best work ever.  Don't miss this film, especially if you enjoy music from the South (fiddlin', pickin' and kickin').  All 5 stars!  It's a one-of-a-kind gem.  And should have been nominated by the Academy for Best Wardrobe.
6304711921|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 15, 1993. The movie was initially to be released through Disney Studios, but the powers that be though that Nightmare was and I quote \\"too dark and scary for kids\\". Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, has just finished another Halloween and is depressed because it is the same old scare year after year; though the residents of Halloween Town enjoy it very much. Jack is looking for that something in his life and goes wondering off into the woods and find the holiday trees of Valentine Day, Easter, Saint Patrick Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween and Christmas. Each tree is a portal to that town and he accidently opens the Christmas Tree's portal door and gets sucked into Christmas Town. Jack is amazed at what he sees in Christmas Town; Christmas Town is the exact opposite of Halloween Town. In Christmas Town everybody is happy, building toys, and the smell of pie is everywhere. When Jack comes back to Halloween town and calls a town meeting, he tries to explain Christmas to the resident but the residents just cannot grasp it.     Jack heads home and stays lock up in his lab trying to use a scientific approach to understand Christmas as well as performing experiments. Finally Jack is able to solve the problem about Christmas and announce to the residents of Halloween Town, who are witches, ghosts, vampires, zombies and bunch of other scary residents, that Christmas is ours this year. The only thing wrong with this picture is that the people who live in Halloween Town have live a life of scaring, doing creepy things, and being evil. They are unable to grasp the goodness of Christmas, but they do their best to try. The sleigh that Jack drives is coffin shaped and is pulled\flown by three skeleton reindeers; just to give you and example. Jack sends Lock, Shock and Barrel to snatch Santa Claus and bring him to Halloween Town. The three are able to find Santa Claus and hand himover to Oogie Boogie who begins to taunt him. Meanwhile Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, flies off into the night sky with his bag of scary toys to hand out to the children of the world.    Jack plans backfires when the parents inform the police of the phony Santa Clause and Jack's sleigh and reindeers are shot down from the sky. Jack realizes what he has done and head back to Halloween Town to rescue Santa Clause and set everything straight. Jack discovers that Santa Claus is held captive by Oogie Boogie and that Oogie Boogie is about to kill Santa Claus and Sally. Jack is able to rescue Santa Clause and Sally and defeats Oogie Boogie. In the end Santa Claus is able to restore Christmas and out the end of the movie it begins to snow and the residents begin to sing their version of What's This. Not since Mad Monster Party came out in 1967 has there been a stop motion picture been made; though I could be wrong. The Nightmare Before Christmas gets an AAAAA+++++.

0061478784|5.0|Wow! What a ride. From the start, Howl's Moving Castle grabs you and takes you on a wild ride of magic, adventure, mystery and love.     At the beginning of the story, we meet Sophie, a plain young hat-maker. For some reason, the Witch of the Waste casts a spell on her and Sophie is instantaneously an old woman. She can't tell anyone about the spell and ironically sees the spell as an opportunity to set out on her own.     Tired and weary from a day of walking, Sophie must seek refuge in Howl's moving castle. Inside, she finds an unholy mess. She then meets the fire demon Calcifer, Howl's apprentice Michael, and eventually Howl.     Despite his reputation for evil-doing, Howl is not one to turn out someone in need. When Sophie tells him that she is the new cleaning lady, he allows her to be that and she sets to the task (barring a few limits which Howl has placed upon her cleaning.) The ragtag team of people in this 'household' become close.     Sophie learns about the ties that bind Howl and Calcifer. She learns much of the magic of the house and even comes to find out she has some magic herself. To no avail, she tries to help Howl elude the responsibility of finding the Prince and the Wizard of Suliman. She roots for Howl in his fight with the Witch of the Waste but she is still concerned over his womanizing and the inevitable heartbreak which will befall her sister Lettie.    So much happens in so many interesting places, I would do a disservice to say that this is a summary of the book. Suffice it to say, that I recommend that you read this book. It's a fun-filled adventure that will leave you breathless.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|Definitely remove the extension barrel if you want range and accuracy.  Its bore is much larger than the dart making it act more like a silencer than an rifle barrel.  Not that there's sound to be suppressed, but it will cost velocity and accuracy.    Otherwise, I'm very impressed by both guns that I received for Christmas- the CS-6 and RV-10.  I'm amazed that the clip-fed CS-6 can pump out those foam-rubber darts as fast as I can fire without jamming completely.  Not to mention the tight pattern that can be had from the RV-10 \\"Barricade\\".  These are well-designed and well-constructed toys.    (The high \\"educational\\" rating is only for those who'd be inclined to take it apart & see how it works.)
B0049OSQ18|4.0|I've bought an occasional Decemberists album or song here and there. Their last album, Hazards of Love, seemed to go in a different direction than Crane Wife or Picaresque. The King is Dead brings back the best of The Decemberists -- jangly, old REM-like songs with a quirky slant towards older times. At 39-1/2 minutes, this is a fast-paced album with only two songs coming close to the 5-minute mark. Gone are the longer story arcs of the past (\\"California One/ Youth and Beauty Brigade\\", \\"Crane Wife 1 & 2\\", \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\", \\"The Island\\") in favor of radio-friendly shorter songs that are bursting with beauty.<br /><br />Up-tempo songs are evenly placed throughout the album, and the slower-tempo songs are sung with a yearning that makes each one precious. The highlights of the album for me include \\"Rox in the Box\\", a jaunty number with a familiar pace but catchy nonetheless. Opener \\"Don't Carry it All\\" provides the best burst of an opening to a Decemberists album since \\"Infanta\\" led of Picaresque, and the radio hit \\"Down by the Water\\" is one of the best songs of the year. That song is followed by \\"All Arise!\\", maybe the closest thing to a dud on the album but the only low spot, and the album finishes nicely and completes with \\"Dear Avery\\", classic Decemberists but with a sorrowful slide guitar that provides the perfect tug on the heartstrings. 2011 is only two months complete, but so far, this is my favorite album of the year.
B0029LHX1W|4.0|In the 1950s in the Soviet Union, there is no crime. At least that's what the government wants everyone to believe. But in truth, there's a serial killer on the loose, preying on children, brutally killing them and escaping blame as the government covers up the crimes so know one knows this could possibly happen in this country.<br /><br />In Child 44, Tom Rob Smith has weaved a page-turning, psychological thriller about the search for a killer who is based loosely on a real killer ~ Andrei Chikatilo. We don't get to know the murderer very well throughout most of the novel. Smith follows the story through the eyes of Leo Dimidov, the government agent who is trying to uncover the truth of the murders. He creates a thriller that reminds me of Stieg Larsson's style, although this was a bit easier to follow.<br /><br />It's a fascinating look at the Soviet Union during Stalin's rule, when innocent citizens were arrested and killed for crimes against the government and crimes they never committed, all so the government could uphold the appearance of a perfect society. It was actually quite disturbing to think this is how it really was at that time.<br /><br />Child 44 is a great thriller, but it is a bit gruesome at times, so it's definitely not for everyone. If you liked Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I'd definitely recommend it. If that book was too graphic in terms of violence, you probably wouldn't enjoy Child 44. This is the first in a trilogy, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next one, The Secret Speech.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this is the best show on TV. The set and costumes are so fantastic. I could just watch it to get ideas for modern living. Don Draper helps reel me in, too. The dvd set is good for true fans. A must have.
0316098337|4.0|I've been reading about Room by Emma Donoghue for a long time now. It seems like everyone has read it and recommended it. So when it was chosen for my book club, I was excited to finally take the time to read it myself. The first half of the book takes place in Room, where we learn all about the only world Jack has ever know, all from his personal perspective. The second half of the book moves to Outside, where we watch as Ma and Jack try to adapt to the real world after being locked away for so many years.<br /><br />It's been about a week since I finished this book. Usually I write reviews right after reading a book but I felt like I needed to think about this one first. On the one hand, the voice of Jack quite honestly annoyed me at times. It was a bit of a struggle to read every single word in the voice of a 5 year old. But the overall story is amazingly well done.<br /><br />The world that Donoghue has created in Room, and the perspective of a boy who has only ever known this one 11x11 square of the world, seems spot on. Then, when they transition to Outside, the interactions with people, including Ma's family, and the sensory issues Jack has to deal with also seem extremely realistic. I'm fascinated by the way Donoghue brought all of this together into a story of the love between a mother and a son. And I do have to say that the book wouldn't be nearly as compelling if it were told in someone else's voice.<br /><br />On the surface, this book doesn't seem all that amazing. But when I really sat down and thought about the overall idea and the way Donoghue executed it, I am quite impressed.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Almost a \\"clay-mation\\" version of a story with an all star cast.  Quite funny and well worth a viewing.  Kids like it too.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Benjamin Barker and his beautiful wife Lucy have a daughter named Joanna and a wonderful life together. Judge Turpin is enticed by Lucy and falsely imprisons Barker to allow him to fully persue her. Benjamin returns after fifteen years only to find that his entire life is gone. His wife is dead and his daughter is in the clutches of the very man who imprisoned him. Revenge is the only thing on his mind after Mrs. Lovett, the owner of the place he used to live, filled him in on all the details of the events that transpired after he was gone. He assumes an new identity as Sweeney Todd and opens up a barber shop to lie in wait for the judge. In the meantime, before the Judge shows up, he practices on unsuspecting customers while Mrs. Lovett makes the most delicious meat pies with a very special ingredient...    The first experience I ever had with Sweeney Todd was watching the version with Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett and George Hern as Sweeney Todd. I was incredibly bored and shocked at how such a disturbing, interesting story could be turned into such a bore. As disappointing as this one was, I was looking forward to Tim Burton's new endeavor because he's one of my favorite directors of all time. I'm so happy that he gave the musical new life on the screen with his collaboration with the great Stephen Sondheim.    The music is wonderful throughout the film. I've heard a lot of people say there aren't any memorable songs, but I think this is more due to the fact that it sounds much more modern, syncopated, and dissonant than the typical Broadway musical. The songs have a great range from the dark and stormy Epiphany to the delightfully comical A Little Priest to the beautiful, melancholy Green Finch and Linnet Bird. My favorite song is My Friends because of the wonderful interweaving of Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett's voices. It's deceptively quiet and understated, but really reveals the truth in their relationship: Todd is completely consumed by his need for revenge andMrs. Lovett, although forgotten by Todd, simply wants to be loved by him. I was relieved that Sondheim didn't choose to have operatic voices featured in the film because I think that's part of why I didn't like the previous rendition. I both love Johnny Depp's rough, rock influenced rendition and Helena Bonham Carter's wispy, fragile voice. They are by no means professional singers, but they embody their characters so well that their voices just fit. I really couldn't see anyone else as these characters. The two best singers in the film are easily young Ed Sanders as Toby and Jayne Wisener as Johanna. These two young people blew me away with their singing voices and I hope to see more from them.    The visuals of the film are striking, portraying the gritty and dark underbelly of London. The color scheme is mostly in black and white with the only real color being the blood that spills in copious amounts across the screen. The only really vibrant, saturated colors come from the songBy the Sea, which shows Mrs. Lovett's dream of a life with Todd and Toby as her family. The absence of color in the real world shows that there is really no hope for anyone in this story. The makeup used on the main characters is reminiscent of silent films and classic horror movies. It both sets them apart from the other characters and enhances the dark ambiance that encompasses the film. One of the things I most enjoy about the film is the cinematography during songs. This is no boring musical with one angle for an entire song. The visuals are just as striking as the music with the changes in camera angle, playing with reflective and transparent surfaces, and the use of wide shots as well as close-ups. This made the film dynamic and as interesting to watch as it is to listen to.    The two most compelling characters in the film are both women: Mrs. Lovett and Johanna. Mrs. Lovett is much more than a conniving woman that wants to use Todd to her own ends. Although it would be easy to simply portray her as an evil villain that cooks people into meat pies, she's really so much more than that. Everything that she does in the film is really fueled by love. She loves Sweeney Todd so much that she is willing to help him kill people so that he will be with her. Her efforts throughout the film are to protect and manipulate Todd to stay with her as long as possible. Her nurturing side is definitely featured in the film, shown through her taking Toby under her wing and treating him like a son. She also expresses sympathy for Johanna who never really had a mother or a loving family to take care of her. This different side of her really endeared her to me and made hopeful that she would get the family she wanted even though she wasn't a completely good person.    Johanna is an interesting character. Because she has been isolated and ogled by Judge Turpin her whole life, one would assume that she would be naive and probably warped in some way. This isn't true at all. She is melancholy obviously because her guardian is abusive, but she sees the world in a practical way. Anthony has seen locations all over the world as a sailor, but he remains convinced that they will run away and live happily ever after together. Johanna knows that all their problems won't be solved and reveals herself to be more realistic than him. Her strength and resilience are truly impressive. It was easy to portray her as a wilting flower of a girl who was weak and bland. Jayne Wisener takes a small role and makes it truly memorable with her quiet confidence and beautiful singing voice.    Sweeney Todd is one of the best musicals made in recent years. I love how Tim Burton combined silent movie horror with the more bloody, gory horror of the present. I am still impressed with all of the acting, no matter how small the role. It is a film I will be watching again and again for many years to come.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Scenes included in the Extended Collector's Edition cut of film give a much wider view of where the director's mind was. In some ways it's like watching a whole new movie.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|First and foremost... Is this going to be the original and the supposedly \\"enhanced\\" Original Trilogy or just the \\"enhanced\\" version. Secondly is this going to be widescreen? As it is Bluray I would suspect that it would be but we have been had before... And quite frankly there is the question of Quality of Transfer to contend with, will this Edition be worth buying? No... as much as I am a fan of the series (both old and new) I am going to have to wait till there is MORE information before I am willing to part with my hard earned cash. Once Bitten, Twice Shy.

0385341008|5.0|I love historical novels; particularly those based on World War II.  I highly recommend this fascinating read to anyone looking to learn more about the War and how it affected the lives of people in lesser known areas.  It is written in an untraditional manner: letters back and forth between the people of Guernsey and others.  It is beautifully written, and it managed to suck me in from the very beginning.  Because it is written in letter form, a very personal bond is created between the reader and the characters.  The characters share their feelings with one another in their letters, and this allows the reader to see a side of each character that most novels cannot accomplish.  Cannot recommend this read highly enough!  Enjoy!

I had my doubts, but if folks aren't aware of the new book and program, they're assuming the bacon and egg diet isn't healthy.  It's not about the protein, but a different thought process when eating that you train yourself to adopt.

0375850864|4.0|Change is part of growing up, but for Miranda, change is hard to get used to. Especially when her best friend Sal suddenly decides to quit being her friend, when the crazy guy on the corner starts acting weirder than usual, and when mysterious notes beginning appearing among her things.<br /><br />--Slipped between the pages of her favorite book.<br /><br />--Tucked inside her friend's book bag.<br /><br />--Buried beneath a pocket-full of old Kleenexes in last year's winter coat.<br /><br />--Folded inside Mr. Perfect's shoe.<br /><br />Sal's absence Miranda can deal with, though she misses him terribly. And the crazy guy--Kicker, \\"because he does these sudden kicks into the street, like he is trying to punt one of the cars speeding up Amsterdam Avenue,\\"--she's used to, though he still gives her the willies. But the notes are frightening.<br /><br />The first one arrives, scrawled on a tiny slip of paper:<br /><br />I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. First, you must write me a letter.<br /><br />The notes continue to arrive, and before long, Miranda realizes that whoever is leaving them, knows far too much about her--more than anyone. Each one forces her to admit that only she can prevent a tragic death, until the final note makes her think she's too late.<br /><br />WHEN YOU REACH ME, Rebecca Stead's middle-grade Newbery Winner, is woven through with mystery, suspense, and the ageless belief that anything is possible. A timeless story, suitable for readers of any age, this book not only deals with issues of bullying and racism, but also the value of friendship, honesty, the importance of family, and an unfailing belief in others no matter how \\"crazy\\" they may seem.<br /><br />Laced with humor and wit, honesty, and the gloriously-flawed perfection of a well-written character, Stead masterfully gives voice to our longing as we try to understand how and why things happen the way they do. A fantastic read.

B004G600A4|4.0|(I gave this movie 4 stars because nothing is perfect, so therefore, no 5 stars.)  When I go see an animated movie, I am not looking for serious plot, serious music, or serious anything, come to think of it.    I am looking for entertainment.    Period.    \\"Tangled\\" gave me that.  BOY, did it ever give me that!    I saw it first with my sis-in-law...we are both in our late 60's.  Then, when my granddaughter (she's 5) said she'd seen it, loved it, wanted to see it again...I was happy to oblige, and off we went.  It was even better the second time around because I didn't have to think much about the plot, I could focus on the outstanding animation and the humor--the over-the-top, truly funny humor.  (Most of the 'funny' films these days have a humor rating that equals a junior-high locker room, either gender.)  That horse steals the show!  I'm from the generation that was the first to see \\"Snow White\\".  The animation in that film defies description when you remember that it was done literally stroke by stroke.    I don't want to know how they did \\"Tangled\\", it would spoil the magic.  To debate plot line, etc. in this film is a waste of time.  Just sit back and ENJOY it.

0425166805|4.0|In all, an entertaining read.  A couple presumptive and, well...iffy logic here and there, but otherwise I find his \\"Anecdotal Proofs\\" to be by far the most convincing arguments in this book.  And like a lot of you have said, it's not as much the attempts at proof he entertains but more so the attempt at opening people's curiosities.  After all, my great-grandpa always said, \\"Well why wouldn't people believe in aliens.  They've been believing in God for thousands of years, haven't they?\\".  In all, entertainment value.  Not being a huge history buff, I couldn't really make many comments on the facts presented.  In all, he could have misled me anywhere he liked and I would have been none the wiser.  Otherwise, an interesting book to read on a lazy afternoon.

From an incompetent Treasury to a complicit SEC, fiscal rape continues to be committed on the American public. It amazes me how the populace has not revolted in the absence of any effort at reform by the Obama administration. I wish Ferguson had included additional aspects of the American stock market Ponzi scheme such as hedge funds and naked short selling, which actually caused the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

0553805371|1.0|The Grand Design - by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow<br /><br />Review by Dana<br /><br />I love, love, love Stephen Hawking.  He is a rock star in my world.  I loved a Brief History of Time.  I loved watching specials where he is asked for his views on humanity, cosmology, black holes, etc...<br />However, if my love of Hawking's theories and ideas were equitable to a marriage, this book would be grounds for divorce due to infidelity!<br /><br />The Grand Design came into being with Grand Expectations of answering Grand Questions.  In the marketing synopsis for 'The Grand Design', Hawking asserts:  \\"Years ago I wrote A Brief History of Time, to try to explain where the universe came from, and where it is going. But that book left some important questions unanswered. Why is there a universe?  Why is there something rather than nothing? Why do we exist? Why are the laws of nature what they are? Did the universe need a designer<br />and creator?\\"<br /><br />In attempting to create further 'buzz' surrounding 'The Grand Design', Hawking declares, \\"Philosophy is Dead\\"!  I admit, I was confused by that statement, since Hawking's entire life's work has been but a subset of Philosophy!  I thought, \\"What\\"?  Is Hawking going to tell us he is a theist all of a sudden?  The answer to the latter is, No.  The answer to the former is, declaring philosophy dead WAS a gimmick.  But, it was more than that!  Philosophy IS the study of all knowledge.  All disciplines that seek to answer questions that knowledge would allow is philosophy.  HOWEVER, with regard to 'The Grand Design', philosophy IS, in fact, DEAD!  Meaning, the book contains little or no new scientific information and the ANSWERS to the BIG QUESTIONS Hawking purports to bestow, are not answers at all.  Rather, they are unsupported suppositions, at best.  At worst, they are intentional questions formed to sell a book and he does not even bother himself with providing reasoned or logical ANSWERS WHY!  I'll save you the time in reading the book by furnishing The Grand Answers, as Hawking tells them, but paraphrased for brevity.<br /><br />Q. Why is there a universe?<br />A. Because of M-Theory, which allows for infinite universes (multiverse on steroids) and infinite states of matter and<br />time/space within each universe.  In fact, one of these universes could be strikingly similar to ours, except in that dimension, the moon might truly be made of Roquefort cheese.<br /><br />Q. Why is there something rather than nothing?<br />A. The universe can and will create itself from nothing in the manner described by the Feynman sum over histories and M-Theory.<br /><br />Q. Why do we exist?<br />A.  Because of M-Theory<br /><br />Q. Why are the laws of nature what they are?<br />A. Because of M-Theory<br /><br />Q. Did the universe need a designer and creator?<br />A.  No, the universe does not need a designer.  Yes, the universe does need a creator, and that is gravity.<br /><br />Bonus Question<br /><br />Q. What does the `M' in `M-Theory' stand for?<br />A.  The M-Theory of everything does not answer this question., in fact, no one seems to know what the \\"M\\" stands for, but it may be \\"master,\\" miracle,\\" or \\"mystery.\\"<br /><br />If you don't believe the above are Hawking's answers to these questions, by all means, waste your money and buy the book.  I wish I hadn't!
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Fighter, the rags to riches story of Micky Ward who became a world champion fighter, treads a lot of familiar terrain.  It is a brutal boxing movie (but no more so than other honest depictions of the genre) where ringside spectators get splattered in blood and it is a Boston-area underdog rising out of a very gritty environment.  So you have Rocky, you have Good Will Hunting, you have Mystic River.  But this is non-fiction -- how non-fiction I'll leave for others to parse -- and, here's the big thing, it is an acting tour de force.  Mark Wahlberg is convincing as Micky Ward, but overshadowed by Christian Bale, as his crackhead half-brother, (Bale once again doing terrible things to his body for a movie), by Melissa Leo as his monster Mom, and by Amy Adams as his stand-up girlfriend.  There is also a monstrous Greek chorus of sorts, consisting of Ward's sisters and half sisters, who spend a good deal of their screen time carping and raging about Micky's girlfriend.  The confrontation scene at Adams's house where Walhberg has spent the night is one of the movie's comic -- for it does have its share of comic moments on the march to triumph -- is a true gem.
B00498YZH8|5.0|jennifer lawrence, as a young actress, is so great in winter bone, you have to buy this movie, and watch it over, and over again.  smokey joe myers, a recording artist, thought the sound could of been better, very low sound, but the lyrics were priceless.  this movie, is not easy to watch, but you cannot walk away from it either it might not win the academy award for best picture,  because of so much politics, but always be entertain in the future, by jenifer lawrence.
0385737955|2.0|Heard about this book and was impressed by all the glowing reviews.  Since \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy was one of my recent favorite reads and this book is being compared to it, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  Sad to say, it did not measure up to my expectation (not even close).  The writing style of this author did not appeal to me.  It is choppy with bad transition.  The characters were not well developed.  In fact, the only likeable character in my mind was Minho.  The Griever, which is suppose to be scary, struck me as ridiculous.  I kept reading thinking I will get into eventually, but at the end, it only left me wondering why so many people liked it.  I gave it to my daughter, who is an avivd reader to get her opinion (without telling her mine).  She pretty much came to the same conclusion.  Whatever it is that struck readers out there will remain a mystery to me.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I finished this book not only was I silent, I also look at people differently. This book tells the story of Charlie, a freshman in high school, who like all of us is trying to figure out the world. As an avid reader this book easily makes my top ten. I woul reccomend this book to anyone.
B00009L1UP|3.0|Casual fan here. I'll admit this is the only Queensryche I own. Had the cassingle of \\"Silent Lucidity\\" back in 90-91, led me to this album. Of course what came to be their biggest hit didn't sound like the majority of their output. I'm sure that disappointed a few people. Same thing happened with Extreme's \\"More Than Words\\". Being a hard rock/metal fan I love this whole album. Can't compare it to their others, but this is solid front-to-back. Great opener with \\"Best I Can\\". The title track rocks. \\"Another Rainy Night\\" is a favorite. Overall it's one of those albums that's heavy enough, but not too heavy. I've heard them called \\"the metal Pink Floyd\\" a few times. I'll agree with that.
B004MMEIK0|2.0|The story is weak, and the writing is not the best. I deleted it off my Kindle. I know free is tempting, but honestly skip it.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|Not as strong as the debut, but still well worth it for the legion of D fans. You could argue it's more of the same, but it's different...the same. This of course is the soundtrack to their underrated non-hit movie. Like the first album alot of the intention here is humor, but it's also musically very good I think. Reminds me of maybe Infant Sorrow or some of Trey Parkers music, funny...but kick-ass rockin' funny. Not sure who I'm trying to persuede here. If you're really a fan you got this five years ago. Now if that darn movie didn't bomb, maybe we'd have some new D by now. ALL HAIL!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is hands-down the best show on TV.  The best writing, the best set, the best attention to detail, and the best actors.  Makes me want to get in advertising (or go back to the 60s), but I know neither is as exciting as it comes across here.  Would certainly be nice to have the carefree lifestyle portrayed here though.    I have really enjoyed this show as well as another AMC show, Breaking Bad.  I am looking forward to seeing more from this network!!
B004KAB32U|4.0|I actually saw this kit at another big bookstore for over twice the price. Got it here of course. Nice bunch of stuff. For me this was worth getting just for the mousepad and coffee mug. The mousepad looks great, good quality too. The magnet and patch I'll put to use someplace. The toe...my kids liked it. The certificate...who cares. Nice little booklet though. Music would have been a nice touch, but I guess they gotta sell cd's and dvd's too. Anyway, if you're a Lebowski fan, for the price, get it man.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|People have been talking to me about this show forever, so I finally gave it a shot.  Really great writing and I love the characters.  Hard to believe that the main actor is the same guy from Malcolm in the Middle!!    This is a series that will really make you think about morality, what is right, and what is wrong.  It explores lots of gray areas and will make you look at your own life in a different way.    This series has great writing and really kept me on the edge of my seat.  Was glad to be able to see it on DVD, so I could watch them as quickly as I wanted to.    Can't wait to see the new season!!
B000777J2S|4.0|What hasn't been said about this album yet. Antony has one of those voices that when you hear it for the first time, you stop what you were doing, and just listen. Like many I assume, I first heard/saw him covering Leonard Cohen's \\"If It Be Your Will\\". That led me here. Like Jeff Buckley's cover of \\"Halleluja\\", it nearly tops the original. This album starts very strong with \\"Hope There's Someone\\", maybe the best and most dramatic song on the album. I won't name every song, they're all good. Perfect choice of guests also, I mean really. I can easily see why \\"I Am A Bird Now\\" was an award winner. For lack of a better word, it's truly beautiful.
1582701709|5.0|In last two years we have told a lot of people about the book.  It was given as a gift to me. We gifted few othe people the book.  We had discussed the book at our ladies luncheon.  Watched video too.  It is your belief and things happen.  I am firm believer of that. The Secret shows how to apply the thing we had already known.
0756405890|1.0|My first review of this book was reported by an offended fan and removed by Amazon (I will not deny that it may have been warranted). For this review I decided to articulate in detail why I don't like this book in a very clear and fair manner. Regardless of this review being helpful it will probably receive many &#34;Not Helpful&#34; votes by fans trying to bury negative reviews out of spite, examples of this can be seen on some worthy reviews below. The question is asking if the review is helpful, it's not asking if you enjoy valid criticism of your favorite book.<br /><br />[No Spoilers]<br /><br />The book is about a man named Kvothe who is telling his life story at an Inn, beginning as a young boy in a group of traveling performers. The world the book takes place in involves a magic system called &#34;Sympathy&#34;, and a &#34;True Name&#34; power, where knowing the true name of something gives you power over it. The story is fairly linear aside from moments where you are reading about the present day Kvothe telling his story.<br /><br /> Pros:<br />- Interesting concept (The main character telling the story of his past)<br />- Unique magic system called &#34;Sympathy&#34;, and the &#34;True Name&#34; power<br />- The author's writing style is not bad<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The main character is pretty much the only one that does not come across as flat<br />- Female characterizations particularly lack depth (The protagonist's &#34;love interest&#34; is poorly written)<br />- The main character comes across as arrogant and unlikeable (If you met Kvothe in real life you would not like him, you'd probably be beneath him anyway)<br />- The main character is over-powered mentally, musically, and magically in an uninteresting way (There're books with adept protagonists that are less abrasive)<br />- EXTREME lack of interesting plot developments for a fantasy book. (It almost felt like I was reading a boring run-of-the-mill fiction for most of the book)<br />- The pacing is slow (Lord of the Rings has slow parts, A song of Ice and Fire has slow parts, but they have what this book does not, rewarding, engrossing moments)<br />- Overwritten (The story does not merit 672 pages, I may have given it 2 stars if it was shorter, but at this length it became tedious)<br />- Overhyped (If this book wasn't rated so highly and presented as the best fantasy story to come along in years I would not have felt so betrayed)<br />- Clich&eacute; (The manner the story is told in is interesting, but the things happening are not. i.e. young orphan boy goes to magic academy, excels at everything)<br />- Boring (For all the reasons mentioned above)<br /><br />I've never felt so cheated over a book before. I'm bothered and confused by the fact that I hated this book, yet so many people love it. My taste in fantasy is very broad. Some of my favorites are: Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Great Book of Amber, A Song of Ice and Fire, Wheel of Time, LOTR, The Mistborn Trilogy, (Dune and Hyperion are favorites for Sci-Fi). Sometimes I'll even pick up a mass-market paperback from the grocery store like &#34;The Dresden Files&#34; and enjoy it.. so I'm not that picky.<br /><br />What is it about this book that makes everyone love it? I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. I would suggest checking out any of the books I mentioned above before buying Name of the Wind. They are all well-loved and deserving of it.<br /><br />I don't think poorly of anyone who likes this book, or wish to disrespect them or the author.
B000002O3I|5.0|Every song is great on these two albums on one disc Howlin Wolfs voice is very powerful and deep what great artists. Hubert Sumlins guitar playing is great and he is one of the best blues guitarists ever that has picked up a axe. Buy this trust me it's awesome if not I suggest you buy Wolf's box sets because without Wolf in your collection the blues ain't complete.Also without hearing the amazing tone and guitar playing of Sumlin your collection aint complete.
B000002L9B|5.0|One of my family members had bought this on vinyl when I was 5 years old back in the 80's, and still remains one of my favorite albums like countless others that I already own by prince. \\"New position\\", \\"kiss\\", \\"Girls and Boys\\", \\"life can be so nice\\", \\"mountains\\", \\"another lover hole in yo head\\" and \\"sometimes it snows in april\\", are like absolute standout soulful songs on this album. The vinyl singles \\"kiss\\" and \\"mountains\\" extended versions are real keepers as well and hope that those vinyl singles \\"kiss\\" extended version and \\"mountains\\" extended version can be released on cd or for mp3 download because, The B-side \\"alexia de paris\\" on the vinyl single \\"mountains\\" is a cool rhythmic instrumental tune and the B-side \\"love or money\\" on the vinyl single \\"kiss\\" is a mad hot jam full of funk.

B00000JMOF|4.0|Even though this film varies drastically from its source material (Frankenstein (Book, 1818)) it still manages to be both frightening and entertaining. The movie follows Henry Frankenstein who is engaged to a girl named Elizabeth. He leaves his fianc&eacute;e for four months to work on an experiment with his assistant Fritz. His experiment is to revive a dead corpse but since he is unable to find a perfectly healthy human corpse (they had to have had something wrong with them if they died after all) he ends up grave digging and putting all of the pieces together to create \\"The Monster\\". When he succeeds in giving it life the Monster manages to escape and cause trouble throughout the entire countryside, killing at will. Will anyone be able to stop the monster? So basically the story is very good although it hardly follows the novel at all, even changing the main characters name from Victor to Henry (yet they named a minor character Victor to add to the confusion). The Monster's intelligence is also drastically brought down to the point where he can't even speak. The main loss though is the fact that the good guy/bad guy relationship is much more black and white. In the original novel it was open to interpretation but here the Monster is clearly bad with Henry being good. So the story is very entertaining, but also a missed opportunity.<br /><br />When it comes to the acting in this film I truly feel that all of the actors did a great job in their roles. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein and really pulls off the mad scientist vibe really well. Then there is Mae Clarke who plays Elizabeth but the script doesn't give her very much room as it makes her out as the damsel in distress. Keeping that in mind though she pulls it off well. And next up is Dwight Frye as Fritz, often incorrectly called Igor by viewers. Frye is great as the crazy and stupid hunchbacked character. Most importantly we have Boris Karloff in the film that raised him into star dome. Even though he is covered in makeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film. He really helps the audience sympathize with his character but at the same time manages to be the angry evil monster. So overall there is some great acting here.<br /><br />All of the makeup and special effects are excellent here with some realistic looking wounds and decomposition on the corpse of the Monster. In addition there are some great sets in the film which truly set the mood with the exception of the final scenes where the Monster is being chased on a mountain which looks somewhat fake. And as for the musical score it complements the picture tremendously. Frankenstein is a very technically sound film overall.<br /><br />As a classic of the horror genre at the time and one of the most famous monster movies ever made I was slightly disappointed with the film. I am a huge fan of the original novel and was disappointed that so few elements transferred over to the movie but nevertheless it is still an excellent monster movie and one that is worth your time. It is very good technically with excellent special effects, sets, and music plus it has some great acting especially from Boris Karloff as the Monster. So give this film a try if you have any interest whatsoever in monster movies, horror, or Frankenstein. But don't expect it to be anything like the book.<br />Score: 8/10akeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film.

0061537969|5.0|After the first few pages, I was skeptical about the entire premise of this book. Things start out a bit slow, and my initial thought was that using a dog as the narrator was simply a cheap gimmick to inflate an otherwise mediocre story.<br /><br />I was wrong. By presenting the story through the eyes of a dog (Enzo is his name), the author gives the reader a new level of insight that would otherwise be impossible. The story is not just emotional and touching, but also inspiring. It is one of the best books I have read in a long time. And considering the fact that I don't even like dogs or racing, that's saying something.<br /><br />Much has already been written by other reviewers, so I won't drag things out. In short, this is a wonderful book and easily earns a full five-star rating.

B000W93CXQ|5.0|I listen to this autobook during a flight home a few months ago.  I was so interested in this book that I finished listening to it before my flight back.  I am in my mid twenties and have worked with teens in a residential addiction recovery center.  I have heard many stories from teens about how lost, angry, hurt and even their thoughts of suicide.  I can't say that I had happy teenage years either.  Though I have read this book many months ago it still has left a mark on me.  I have read many of the reviews on this book and don't agree with them entirely.  The main point of this book is about how our actions, even though they may be small, can have a large effect on others and acts of kindness work the same way.  Not much is said about her suicide in the end but that is not the point to the book.  The point is that if you see someone is having a hard time that just talking with them can save their life.  I spent many of nights talking with the teens about how sucide is not the answer and that highschool is only a small portion of their life.  I hope that I have made a difference for those that I could help.  I suggest reading this book with your teens or preteens and having an open discussion.
0394721780|5.0|I loved this book and when my husband passed away, I gave it to my daughter-in-law.  Many times I wanted to use the book for a recipe and didn't have the book anymore, so I bought another one for myself.
0385341008|5.0|I can't ever accurately remember the name of this book; I recommend it all the time but I get all mushy mouthed about potatoes and literature and guernsey cows. I do, however, remember how I felt when I read it -- giddy and glowing and in love with the characters who are deliciously revealed in a series of exquisite letters. Who knew such a place existed?  Who knew one could get such pleasure from reading this book?
0439023513|2.0|I'm giving it two stars simply because I enjoyed the other two books so much, but to be perfectly honest, I wanted to give it less; while I practically worshiped the first two books and would have given them ten stars if I could have, this last installment to the book brought down my opinion of the entire series. Instead of the empowered feeling of survival and triumph that I have felt while reading the previous two books, I ended this one feeling absolutely depressed and in a vague sense of shock like, \\"Did she really do that? Did this really happen? Is this REALLY the end?\\"<br /><br />And it was.<br /><br />The END.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I had a bad feeling about this one, but I figured since I loved the first two so much, I had to know how it all ended. I figured, like the other books, it would somehow pull through for a fantastic ending that I would be very pleased with, like the other two did.<br /><br />Instead, Katniss--a character I've loved--seems to jump back and forth from being wilted to being needlessly sensitive about certain things you would think she would be hardened to by now. The love story, which I have enjoyed and even felt was necessary due to the plot, stops being enjoyable and becomes unpleasant to read, putting it mildly. (I've always grimaced a little when people say this is like Twilight, because there is SO MUCH more substance to these books, but Katniss/Peeta/Gale did begin to channel Bella/Edward/Jacob a few times in this book....) Katniss seems to want only the guy she can't have, and seems only to attribute credit to some people while leaving out others who move mountains for her and put their life at risk for her. Also, her, \\"I owe [insert name here] so much now!\\" begins to get a little redundant.<br /><br />I had hope about midway through this book, but my hopes were dashed as the depressing ending fell out onto the pages. There is a lot of action, a LOT of violence (all fine, since it obviously fits with the story) but then at the climax of the end, it's abruptly stopped and you're told what happened in summary. Understandable, but it is preceded by a weird dream and I felt a little disoriented at first as I tried to figure out if what I was reading was real of Kat's dream world. Then, since they have to tie up a certain loose end, a fairly weak and not-exactly-heartfelt-explanation is given for why the ending is what it is.<br /><br />All in all, a very disappointing end to a really great series.<br />It honestly makes me sad to give it such a critical, dissatisfied review.<br />:(abruptly stopped and you're told what happened in summary.

B0014DC0AK|5.0|Chuckj Schuldiner is the man. I recently read an article about him in Decibel where all the crazy line-ups in Death talk about Chuck. He just wrote lyrics like this because that was how his life was to him. This album is the height of their progressive music. Every song is layered by Gene Hoglan with a sick drum part, especially the jazzy intro on the title track. Crystal Mountain is a classic song, and every song has a distinct part that makes it its own. Losing Chuck was a horror to the metal world, but luckily the music is still here for us to enjoy and play. Classic, amazing album.

I LOVE the format of the book and the sliding, durable windows, but my son was disappointed when he went to read the last page and it wasn't there!
1400079594|5.0|After reading some recommendations, Michael Dirda's especially, I decided to give Wodehouse a try. I was not disappointed.<br />The characters have character, the plot is full of expected and unexpected twists, and everything is infused with a friendly humor that isn't immature or cynical. So if you're looking for something fun to recover from The Sound and the Fury or Blood Meridian, this is a great choice.
B00006JIA4|2.0|The first CD of greatest hits was the best of all of them and was Classic Queen.  The other two were poor and sclocky.  Contains some poor remixes of older songs plus tweeking them with some Hip-hop and Rap. Not the Queen I grew up hearing. I wish I had done some sort of preview of the other CD's but it looked like good deal for a 3-CD set. Given another chance I'd only buy Hit's #1.

081297381X|5.0|Taleb's central premise is that we delude ourselves with popular stories, false knowledge, myths, overvalued facts, and the appearance of science. He calls this the narrative fallacy, and counsels, \\"The way to avoid the ills of the narrative fallacy is to favor experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories.\\" Good advice.<br /><br />Given this push for what David Brooks calls \\"epistemological modesty,\\" you may expect a humble book, -- and if so, you would be disappointed. Taleb lambasts the hubris of Wall Street, yet he is a product of this culture; and the book shows it. His belief in uncertainty combined with his sharp views is broadly ironic. Some reviewers call it arrogant.<br /><br />I put the bravado aside, and even found it entertaining at times, for Taleb's case is well put, and the book is brisling with thoughtful aphorisms and vivid stories. Here are a few of my favorite lines:<br /><br />- Luck is more important than skill.<br />- Risk is the most when you feel the safest.<br />- Look for evidence that proves your ideas wrong.<br />- There are no experts of things that move.<br />- Too much information becomes toxic.<br />- The wise plead ignorance to world events.<br />- We cannot compare current reality with an alternative.<br />- Our highest currency is respect.<br />- \\"Randomness\\" is unknowledge.<br />- Be prepared for multiple contingencies.<br />- \\"I don't know,\\" is a sign of intelligence.<br />- We are swayed by the sensational.<br />- Seize every opportunity, for they are rare.<br />- Go to parties -- chitchat leads to breakthroughs.<br /><br />These are thoughtful nuggets to consider. And despite the pride that occasionally dances on the pages, Taleb is a good writer and an even better philosopher. The book is part memoir, part postmodern treatise on skepticism, part rant. It is an idiosyncratic, fresh and fascinating narrative.<br /><br />This book is also a full frontal assault on the Wall Street establishment that uses statistics, bell curves and Black-Scholes theory to sell portfolio allocation. For investors, Taleb advocates a \\"barbell strategy\\" where you put 85-90% of your money in cash or equivalents, and the remainder in extremely risky investments that are scalable. He goes on at some length to talk about the dynamics of scalable investments and scalable careers such as sales, venture capital, and entrepreneurial ventures. In the end, he recommends against entering scalable professions due to the many risks involved. More irony.<br /><br />For those who do hit it big and make what Taleb calls FU money, he recommends a dedication to scholarship, for he sees the pursuit of money and material goods as a nightmare. And he warns that scalable success may not come for a long time, or it may never come, and sojourners in scalable professions will have to endure the cruelty of critics. This line of thinking feels balanced and wise.<br /><br />I was fascinated when I read this book in the winter of 2008, partly because Taleb had correctly forecast a major stock market crash, and partly because I had recent experience working as a marketing consultant for a large Wall Street investment firm (which no longer exists).  That consulting experience and this book have left an imprint on my mind.<br /><br />I have not studied Edmond Burke or David Hume, so currently, Nassim Nicholas Taleb my favorite skeptic, and The Black Swan is one of my favorite books.<br /><br />When Taleb was Tweeting, he praised \\"Straw Dogs\\" by the contemporary British philosopher, David Gray. Gray's book takes skepticism to new and brilliant heights, and in my option it flies over the top.

For investors, Taleb advocates a \\"barbell strategy\\" where you put 85-90% of your money in cash or equivalents, and the remainder in extremely risky investments that are scalable. He goes on at some length to talk about the dynamics of scalable investments and scalable careers such as sales, venture capital, and entrepreneurial ventures. In the end, he recommends against entering scalable professions due to the many risks involved. More irony.    For those who do hit it big and make what Taleb calls FU money, he recommends a dedication to scholarship, for he sees the pursuit of money and material goods as a nightmare. And he warns that scalable success may not come for a long time, or it may never come, and sojourners in scalable professions will have to endure the cruelty of critics. This line of thinking feels balanced and wise.    I was fascinated when I read this book in the winter of 2008, partly because Taleb had correctly forecast a major stock market crash, and partly because I had recent experience working as a marketing consultant for a large Wall Street investment firm (which no longer exists).  That consulting experience and this book have left an imprint on my mind.     I have not studied Edmond Burke or David Hume, so currently, Nassim Nicholas Taleb my favorite skeptic, and The Black Swan is one of my favorite books.     When Taleb was Tweeting, he praised \\"Straw Dogs\\" by the contemporary British philosopher, David Gray. Gray's book takes skepticism to new and brilliant heights, and in my option it flies over the top. Perhaps some day I will review Straw Dogs as well, but for now I'll stick with Black Swans.

B003L20ID8|3.0|The Adjustment Bureau is well-acted, with engaging performances by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, and it keeps your attention throughout, moving at a quick pace and exploring interesting concepts of fate, choice, divine intervention, historical development, and free will. Still, taken as a whole, the film is uneven and philosophically untenable. The movie purports to be a celebration of free will over a strict determinism: you must \\"fight for your free will\\" (a notion that entails some circular logic: you need to use an act of the will in order to be able to have willful acts?). Moreover, the central narrative tension (without giving too much away) is presented as being a battle between fate and free will, but certain plot developments make it such that it is actually a tension between two different sorts of fate; the supposedly \\"free\\" will that is praised by the movie is itself tempered by a sort of determinism.<br />The movie's messages are mixed: there's a higher power watching out for us, but it is good to defy that power; we don't know what's best for us, but we should follow our heart; some people are \\"destined\\" for each other, but we get to choose who we love, and so forth.<br /><br />The view of history that is presented in the background of the film (in a description of how the Bureau has intervened in the past) reflects a rather unsophisticated interpretation of historical eras (with, for instance, the \\"highly-cultured\\" Roman Empire being a result of a high degree of the Bureau's intervention, and the \\"Dark Ages\\" being the barbaric result of the misuse of human free will). The historical periods in which the Bureau is said to have been intervening the most (Roman Empire, Enlightenment, Scientific Revolution) are also, ironically, the periods in which humans depended most on their own reason, while the periods when the Bureau pulled back and let humans run the show (notably the Middle Ages) tended to be times when people were most aware of a higher power. You're left with a view of a higher power (Fate? God?) that is hidden and does not want to be discovered (like Deism), and yet is extremely involved in guiding history (the opposite of Deism). And the more the power intervenes, the less it is acknowledged.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining movie with a believable romance, this one works. But if you're looking for a movie with a philosophically nuanced and consistent premise, you're best off looking elsewhere.h a view of a higher power (Fate?

0345509617|5.0|Well, this review will be short. If you are a fan of Star Wars and of how cinema is done, you simply need this book. This book contains everything to show you and explain why The Empire Strikes Back became the most beloved movie of the Star Wars saga. You get notes, old pictures, fun comments, etc. But also, there are some old ideas about what characters would be, what planet would be visited, it's actually fun to see how the saga was building itself one step at a time instead of being completely thought out right at the beginning. Some decisions were made here that changed cinema forever!
0670022411|2.0|This book was not what I expected. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, so I was hoping this book would be more of an adult version of a witch coming to terms with her magical ability. Instead, it turned into basically a romance novel, and boring one at that. I enjoy reading the Sookie Stackhouse books, which I think the author was trying to be like. However, I find the Sookie books are funnier and faster paced. The main character here is a total Mary Sue. This book will appeal to people who want to see themselves worshiped and adored by everyone around them. If you are looking for a book to read where you can appreciate a character and not just want to be that character, I would suggest passing on A Discovery of Witches.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A lot of artists who win the Best New Artist award at the Grammys have been known to have that impressive debut followed by a significant, if not catastrophic, sophomore slump.  One hopes, and indeed thinks, that this will not be the case with British singer Adele, who won the award in 2009 with her album \\"19\\".  Now she's out with her second album, \\"21\\", an album that merits a \\"10\\" rating (or five stars, as is the case here at Amazon), and which seems to ensure that the dreaded sophomore slump doesn't happen to her.    With several producers being involved, including Rick Rubin, who was responsible for, among other things, the Dixie Chicks' 2006 smash TAKING THE LONG WAY, hints of a wide variety of styles being essayed, from straight pop-rock to gospel, R&B, and country, and Adele dropping hints of being influenced by disparate artists like Alison Krauss and Wanda Jackson, one would think that \\"21\\" would be a crazy patchwork quilt.  This turns out not to be quite the case, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  It mostly stays in the blue-eyed soul/pop groove that this young Brit seems as comfortable in as Joss Stone, with such songs as the gospel-tinged \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", the big-beat 60s sound of \\"Rumor Has It\\" (which occasionally smacks of Amy Winehouse's recent cult classic hit \\"Rehab\\" in terms of production values), and the 70s-influenced \\"Lovesong.\\"  The closest that Adele comes to a country-influenced sound is on \\"Don't You Remember\\", which actually closer in spirit to the classic 1970s country-rock ballads of Linda Ronstadt than to the safe, anodyne stuff of Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood.  She also resists for the most part the tendency to over-emote that has turned me off to so many overhyped divas of the last twenty years, which is a relief.    Adele's greatest asset is a voice that sounds extremely mature for someone who is not quite yet 23; and just on the basis of this album and its predecessor, she is only likely to get better as the years go by.  All she needs to do is to not take herself too seriously and not get swept up in the attention surrounding \\"21\\", and her career is liable to be a long one.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Great lyrics, with music to match. I've had \\"Drumming Song\\" stuck in my head for a week now and I'm okay with that!
B004BUUL04|5.0|This is a fantastic album from an artist that has talent in spades. I believe we may be witnessing someone who is on the artistic level of a Bowie or a Buckley (Jeff)... and this being just her first foray into this song-writing thing, I'm personally very excited to see what she does next. Stunning stuff!

B001992NW4|5.0|What's to be said about this film that has not already been said it's been called controversial,praised by critics and audiences alike,and yet this film is titled \\"the scariest movie of all time\\" it earned several oscar nominations.Ellen Burnstyn was nominated Best Actress for The Exorcist(1973),William Friedkin was nominated Best Director, Linda Blair ultimately won for best supporting actress for her role as Megan,the young girl who becomes possed by satin himself.A great film and one of my personal favorites.So the question is how does this film look on Blu?Scanned at a 4K resolution on a 50gb disc in 1080p with an aspect ratio 1.85.1 16x9 The Exorcist has never looked this good in any home meduim until now.It's a big improvement over the previously released dvds.The transfer is very close to the orignal source material,Warner Bros.comes through again in keeping their classic titles true to the film's origanal look.Details are never lacking and theres not a single trace of Dnr(digital noise reduction).Film grain is apparent throughout which adds to the grittiness of the piece.The Exorcist has a very filmic look however if you're looking for this to look anything like Avatar think again.On the audio side there are 2 lossless  tracks DTS HD MA 6.1 on The Director's cut and DTS HD MA 5.1 ON The Orignal Theatrical cut.Both are excellent with plenty of surround activity especally in the rear surrounds this is a pretty beefy soundtrack for a movie from 1973.The ertras are plentiful all are carried over from the orignal dvd release with new exras in HD those include:Raising Hell:filming The Exorcist(a rare behinds the scenes look at the making of this classic with rare footage from the set),The Exorcist locations Goergetown then and now(comparisons between what the city looks like now and how much has changed from 1973),Faces of evil:The differnt versions of The Exorcist(an in depth comparision between the 2000 DIRECTOR'S CUT and The Orignal Theatrical cut),and commentary by William Friedkin.On disc 2 1973 Orignal Theatrical cut,2 commentaries William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty,The 1998 documentary :The Fear Of God:The Making of The Exorcist and much much more.The Exorcist is nicely packaged in a 2 disc digibook form with 38 pages of full color and b&w photos with tid bits on the movie the book has a beautiful gloss finish a nice edition for any Blu-ray DVD collection.So if you're a fan of The Exorcist this is a no brainner or if you've never seen The Exorcist it's worth the buy because now you can see The Exorcist the way it was truely meant to be seen and heard.ry by William Friedkin.On disc 2 1973 Orignal Theatrical cut,2 commentaries William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty,The 1998 documentary :The Fear Of God:The Making of The Exorcist and much much more.The Exorcist is nicely packaged in a 2 disc digibook form with 38 pages of full color and b&w photos with tid bits on the movie the book has a beautiful gloss finish a nice edition for any Blu-ray DVD collection.So if you're a fan of The Exorcist this is a no brainner or if you've never seen The Exorcist it's worth the buy because now you can see The Exorcist the way it was truely meant to be seen and heard.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This is a quality product for a much better price than you would find in a box store.  I honestly can't tell the difference in video quality between this and the 200 dollar top-of-the-line Monster HDMI cable we use for our blu-ray.  I just wished I had ordered the right size.
B000002OX7|5.0|What an album, what a sound and last of all what a group.  A tour-de-force for all the points mentioned above.  If you wanted to explain to people about rock music, just play this and they will get the point pretty quick.  The Lifehouse project collapsed, but from those ashes rose Who's Next and that is my only gripe with this album, it leaves you wanting more!!!  My favourite songs:   My Wife: A song about the fairer sex, yea right. I would cringe too if I had to face her too. A champion song written by John Entwistle.  Behind Blue Eyes: When people always want more and to feel empty. I think this is one of the best rock songs ever for showing how someone feels from the inside.  Won't Get fooled Again: The rock anthem for then and now, how many of us have thought about the last line of this song. You've just been shafted again.  Finally no self respecting rock music collector would be without a copy.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|But it is not for everyone.  Violence and some gore is definitely part of this show.  But if you give it time and start to understand the characters you will really grow to like it.  Every season seems to get better and better.
B000002OZY|5.0|Part fantasy and part based on Pete Townsend's life.  There wouldn't be too many writers who could create a work as complex as this and turn into a hit as well.  It wasn't the first rock opera (I prefer rock musical myself), but probably the best known.  I can't really pick a favourite song, as they all sound good.  The only way to listen this work is to listen in one sitting and to get the point of it.  The songs have stood the test of time, as you still hear some of them covered in concerts.  Over indulgent maybe, overblown maybe, but for my part always worth a listen.
0670022411|1.0|It is easy to accidentally purchase a book on the new Kindle.  I did so in this case, but decided to stick with the book because it had been so highly recommended by Amazon.  What a snooze.  Soulful looks, ridiculous yoga, taking out and putting back her rowboat, filling out library slips...If you hit \\"purchase\\" by mistake, rescind it immediately.
0141040378|5.0|I am a huge bookworm and bought this book specifically because of its fabulous cover.  The book came in perfect condition and I am a fan of the ribbon attached, which can be used as a bookmark.  Such a great book in a chic packaging.  Definitely a great addition to the bookshelf :)
0307386171|2.0|Ian McEwan, born in 1948, is an English novelist and a devout atheist. He has a big reputation, and counts the Booker Prize - won for \\"Amsterdam\\" in 1998 - amongst his awards. \\"On Chesil Beach\\" was shortlisted for the 2007 Booker but, despite being the raging hot favourite, lost out to \\"The Gathering\\" by Anne Enright.     The book opens in July 1962, on the evening of Edward Mayhew and Florence Ponting's wedding. Having married that afternoon in Oxford - and, obviously, not wanting to hang about - they've travelled down the Dorset coast to begin their honeymoon. Sitting having dinner, they're both very nervous about their first night together. (Being 1962, they're still virgins). Although Edward's largely looking forward to it, he's nervous about being a little premature. Florence, on the other hand, is absolutely dreading it - although she does love Edward, the thought of having sex leaves her panic-stricken and feeling sick. As their wedding night moves forward, and with disaster apparently looming, their separate lives and the history of their relationship is told in flashback.    Short, with some nice passages - but some of the fawning reviews I've read are a bigger work of fiction that the book itself. It's full of wasted opportunities - I couldn't help thinking McEwan had simply focused on the wrong section of his characters' lives. Edward's mother, Florence's relationship with her father, their lives after the wedding day - there was so much that, properly developed, could have improved the book no end. Florence and Edward themselves were very poorly developed, and were little more than cliches at times. In spite of what the blurb claims, it's not wonderful, exquisite or devastating : it's a very ordinary book, is well short of amazing and it left me with the impression that McEwan was just going through the motions. 2007 must've been a thin year if this got nominated for the Booker.
0374531269|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books.  I read this during a Faith & Justice class in my undergraduate career but have recommended it to many people, from high school students to my grandparents.  It's an extremely moving and eye-opening book.  It's almost unfathomable that it's a true story.

B003XU7VM4|5.0|I really loved this book. It had a great story line as well as an exciting romance. There were suprises at every turn and it kept me on the edge of my seat dying to read more. After finishing this one, I immediatley had to go out and buy the next one. It is definatly worth your money and time. In a way it is just like the show, each of the characters shows a resembalence to one from the t.v. series. This is everything you enjoy from the series and more in a book. This is my new favorite, and I recomend it 100%!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|These headsets were very good while they lasted.  They were broken within two months  too much money to pay for a product that does not last!  Very disappointed
B001LMU182|5.0|For all people who remember when Akira came to the US on VHS and loved it back then, you may find yourself watching a completely different movie with the Blu-ray version. The animation is the same, but the character's voices have all been redubbed, and done wrong. Case in point, the test subjects are all over the age of 30 (seen in the flashbacks over 30 years ago as they knew Akira) yet they have been given weak childrens voices. None of the characterssound the same or even as you would expect thenm to.     To top it all off, the dialouge has been changed. This is a good and bad thing. Good because it makes for a more cohearant story, so first time viewers know what is happening without needing to watch it 2 or 3 times. Bad because it gets prety ridiculus sometimes and doesnt seem to follow the amimation of the mouths. Some of it just seems stupid. In the opening scene when the customer enters the bar, instead of asking for \\"Red Bennies, 3 of them.\\" he instead requests 3 packs of peanuts.     All in all, I was not too pleased with the blu-ray edition because besides better audio (and the new voice track) there was no goodies we've come to expect on this platform. Commercials and trailers are not that \\"speacial\\" of a feature. I would rather just transfer the VHS to DVD and call it a day.
B001U7B4T8|4.0|It's a long time ago I saw this concert on TV.  With this perfect DVD I can see it many, many times more.  And every time I enjoye.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have started and stopped this dvd hundreds of times. It can be as easy or as hard as you make it depending on the amount of weights you choose to use. I use 3 lbs, need to get 5 though. Jillian is Jillian so you already know what to expect from her and she will work you out. Only thing lacking in this is she couldve spent a little more time doing ab workouts but still a good burn overall. I recommend doing 20-30 min of your own cardio with this for maximum results.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I received this for my birthday. I wanted it to film snowboarding with using my Canon 7D DSLR. It is a little flimsy, probably because the canon 7D is a heavy camera. I was afraid the vibration from the ice/snow would transfer to the camera and the vids would be useless. To my surprise, the videos look really smooth. My lens does have vibration compensation on it however, which may have been the saving grace. Regardless, for the price, this is a pretty solid product. I would recommend, especially if you have a lens with vibration compensation.
0316098337|4.0|I expected from reviews that this book would disturb me but the subject intrigued me and I didn't find it disturbing  as much as I did sad. The author explored the relationships between a mother and son alone in a room for 5 years with great prose and managed to keep the reader interested enough to read the book in one sitting, I felt it could have been an opportunity to explore isolation from the world more. All in all though a great read.
014241543X|4.0|*REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*    I bought if i stay at a bookstore, drawn by the USA Today blurb on the cover that fans of Twilight will enjoy it. After reading this novel, I can't say that I agree with that statement because this book is not really a book like Twilight. Yes, it is a book about death and being caught in that space between life and death, but it is not a paranormal romance story. This book is a very real and raw portrayal of life, loss, family, and love. While I have enjoyed the Twilight series, I would probably have to say that maybe older readers would enjoy this book as opposed to the younger Twilight fans.    Mia is a talented seventeen year old cellist who has dreams of going to Julliard. She has a boyfriend, a cool family, a best friend, and a pretty decent life. However, one day all that changes when Mia and her family get in a horrific car crash. The only survivor and stuck in a coma, Mia is caught between a world between the living and the dead. She's not a ghost, she's sort of stuck in limbo. Shaken and alone, Mia has to make the decision whether she'll let go of life to join her parents or whether she'll stay in this life without them and one that will never be the same. if i stay is a poignant and raw story of Mia's journey and eventually the final decision she makes, weighing all of the pros and cons of staying or going. The story is narrated from her point of view as she watches the doctors operate on her battered body, listens to her family and friends as they come to the hospital, and flashes back to her past memories of all of them, including her parents.    The combination of present-day thoughts together with the memory flashbacks translates into a uniquely-told story of Mia's internal struggle to choose: life or death. It's a bit of a cliche because choosing death would obviously be the easy way out, while life would inherently be a harder choice. But maybe that's the metaphor that gives this book its allure. What would you do, givensuch a choice? In Mia's case, I didn't really see her struggle in terms of making that decision. I think it would have been far better if she'd had some kind of strife in her life, where the easy way out would have been a consideration to escape some sort of pain. Instead, Mia's life is pretty darn perfect - hip parents, cute brother, cool boyfriend, fun best friend, she's talented in music, loving grandparents...in other words, even living a life without her parents and brother, she still has some sort of a future with people who love her. I don't know - maybe I'm being too harsh but it would have been better if she chose life and her choice incorporated some form of hardship...and a true sense of never giving up.    if i stay was beautifully written, and I enjoyed the narration of past and present (I know some reviewers thought that was too jarring). It definitely fleshed out the story and gave Mia some more dimension as a character but to me it was also a double-edged sword, since the flashbacks into Mia's family and friendships as well as her relationship with her boyfriend made me connect with them more, instead of with Mia. I don't know why I didn't feel connected to her; it just felt like sometimes she was too detached, then again, maybe that was intentional as she is in limbo herself. She's not real anymore, instead she's like a memory of herself. Actually, writing that got me thinking a bit - maybe Mia's state of mind is a reflection of what she is and of the place she's in. See? This is why I love books that make you think about them long after you've read them!!    Overall, I would rate if i stay 4 stars. Interesting read and a well-written story, and definitely gives you food for thought.
B003VANOFY|1.0|It's basically a good set, but it is false advertised. There is no noise cancellation on x64 windows 7. Driver's fault probably, but Logitech ain't doing anything about this.     (noise cancellation works fine when you are using voice morphing, but sincerely, if I'd wish to sound like a robot I would grow a throat cancer.)    EDIT:  Month ago Logitech posted long promised software update that fixed nothing. They added voice activation and called it noise cancellation. Now it's cutting words in half:D. If anyone have doubts then check Logitech forums.

B000JMLFLW|4.0|It is said that a good work of fiction represents the ways and manners of the people during the period when it was written.  Being the case, I have a number of observations:<br /><br />1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate.  It was an art in itself.  Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore.  The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.<br /><br />2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music.  In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children.  For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced.  At least this is what I have observed in general.<br /><br />3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age.  Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!<br /><br />4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time.  The elopement of one daughter to an \\"undeserving\\" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.<br /><br />5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage!  Thank God for the automobile!<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos.  Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction.  I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|\\"Brick\\" is well written film noir, with an excellent performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The use of color in this genre was interesting and served the high school contemporary setting well. The fast-paced barbs between characters was reminiscent of Sam Spade, but difficult to buy into high school kids thinking or communicating like that. The femme fatale was well written and overall, it was an enjoyable film.

1594202842|4.0|This insight into cultural differences and norms in parenting explained a lot to me.  I always wondered how Asian children excelled, and now I know.  I won't be applying everything that Amy Chua does, but it certainly increased my resolve to expect more from my daughter when it comes to her level of effort on homework and activities.      The book was well written and offered a candid look inside another family's home, which I've often wondered about when I look at other families (\\"I wonder what it's like at their house?\\").  Bascially, if you've ever wondered how an Olympic athlete or child prodigy of any type got to be that good, this will explain it:  hours upon hours of practice, and an extreme commitment from the parent and child.
B003L77G6A|1.0|Laughing At you, not With you.    I'm a long time fan of the Big Bang Theory, but, I'm afraid I have to report, it's really gone down hill in the fourth season or so.  I deeply regret this, because when the show started out, it was hilarious, but now I find there are several causes dragging its quality down.    At, Not With:  Mainly, it's that the show is now laughing at the characters, instead of with them.  Originally, the show was about science geeks, but done in such a way that real-life science geeks could laugh at the humor.  Now, however, it's more about how the characters are freaks rather than people.  Before, the show had a tone of gentle self depreciation, now it's outright derision.    The characters have lost a lot of their likeability.  They started out as quirky but friendly guys.  Now their quirks have taken over, and the friendliness has badly faded.  They spend much of their time together bickering.    Science & Cameos:  When the show started, they actually had a science advisor!  I haven't checked the credits, but I wonder if they've fired him.  They sure aren't using him.  Now, what little science-fiction humor there is, is almost purely based on cameo appearances by science fiction actors and actresses.  Sometimes it works brilliantly:  George Takei was hilarious!  The rest of them... not so much.    Directionless:  In the first and second season, there was a definite direction to the show.  Leonard and Penny's relationship was on again off again, but there was a definite feeling that things were moving.  In the third season, the romance bloomed, and in only a very few short episodes fell apart.  It was disappointing that they had such a lead up, and then completely gave up on what should have been the climax.    Once that relationship theme fell apart, the show really didn't have anywhere to go, and has been floundering around, directionless ever since.  Every once in a while, we get an inkling that they may be moving toward something, but theyquickly forget that and go off in a different direction.    Penny vs Sheldon:  One of the better comedy elements of the show was watching Penny & Sheldon play off each other.  The two actors worked wonderfully together, the comic timing was excellent, the interaction was brilliant.  Now, the two characters hardly ever speak to each other, and when they do, they have the character of Amy coming between them.    Most of the time, dialog that would have been given to Penny to draw out Sheldon's character, is now given to Amy.  Like Sheldon, Amy is played as a humorless deadpan.  Watching two humorless deadpans delivering their lines just isn't as funny as watching Penny's reaction shots.  The short skit they had with Penny attempting to teach Sheldon how to act was much more funny than anything Sheldon has ever done with Amy.    The Uniqueness is gone:  Sadly, with the science humor on the back burner, and less focus on the science fiction fan humor, the show has lost the niche it started out with.  I assume that the writers & producers are wanting to aim the show at more of a main stream audience, but when you take the flavor out of it, you're left with just another sitcom about annoying people with relationship problems.    I'm afraid I won't be buying Season 4, unless Season 5 improves and I need to complete the set.  I sincerely hope that I will have cause to do so at some point.  But right now, the show has become painful to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After thoroughly enjoying the first two books in the series, I had similar expectations for this book.  What a letdown.  This storyline had so much potential, but the third book reads as though the author herself lost interest in Katniss.      This book is not the gripping pageturner you become accustomed to after reading the first two books.  Worth reading to finish out the story, but leaves the reader feeling flat and frustrated.
0312427999|4.0|The way I know whether theories are true or not is by testing them against my perception of the world and what I was suspecting already. Having been in this world for quite a number of years I often use my life experience in order to test all kinds of theories. This book gave me a lot of the answers I was looking for, showed me that what I suspected had been happening in the world for many years is true. I can't imagine how some people can say that Naomi Klein's theories are all rubbish.... but well, if you don't want to see the world as it really is (and it is scary..... I will give you that much) then denying what has been going on is the best way to protect your beliefs. I had never been able to understand how life seems to have become one disaster after the other, how misery never seems to end, even in developed, more well off countries, how many countries only talk about deficit, about hard measures, recessions, but things never seem to get better and if they do it is only temporary because the next disaster always seems to be around the corner. Don't people see that? If they don't they don't live in the same world I do! And Naomi Klein is right, people can take their destiny in their own hands, the Greeks are doing that right now but most people are just too afraid, too busy, too asleep, too depressive and don't take justice in their own hands. Governments are not God, most of them are there because we put them there but we seem to have forgotten that! We put this people there and they should be accountable to us, instead they are able to do with our lives and our money exactly what they feel like. It is oppression everywhere although we are told that we live in the free world, everything gets worse, be it health care, education, crime.... we live in a surveillance society but even that doesn't help. We are squeezed to the bone for everything we earn but the economies never seems to get better... and no one questions what is going on? Weird.... and when one comes with an explanation which is probably for at least 98% correct we call it rubbish. Then again, you surely don't live in the same world I do, lucky you! Things seem to be changing in South America but will they continue to do? I have little hope. The world is full of people, maybe even too many but we can't do anything against a handful of people who want to make sure life is as miserable as possible. Shouldn't life be about living, about fulfillment, about working hard but building a good life for yourself and all around you? There is where Friedman got it completely wrong.... the life he envisioned for all of us is a life without hope, a life based on money and on markets but.... he forgot that we are human beings, we are not only market tools and slaves of his theories.     Many of this people seem to have ended up in prison but not the big fish, I'm afraid, those no one will ever touch and that will have to happen if things are to get better and Milton should have been the first one!     Maybe a solution would be to dismantle big powers like it has already happened with the Soviet Union. The EU and the USA should follow. Then countries should start thinking and living for themselves. If everybody works towards the best life possible for their people we will all be better off! And those who don't? Too bad.... if life gets tough maybe they will rethink their policies! And work towards a lower world population, that should be a priority and will solve many, many problems! But at the end of the day who am I? If what people want is the kind of society we live in, based on money and power let's go on living like that!     I didn't give this book five stars because I was amazed that Naomi Klein, who saw through many of the scams that have been going on for decades couldn't see through the Global Warming /Climate Change scam. But then I read that she writes for the Guardian... maybe that explains it, I don't know, or it is maybe that the book came out in 2008. It ismore than clear to me that this Global Warming thing is nothing more than another shock doctrine designed to get our money and to beat us into submission. One would think that a journalist of her caliber would have understood this from the start? Well, hopefully in the meanwhile she has had the time to follow all the scandals and will update that part in a future edition.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book and the next two in the series seemed to be EVERYWHERE last summer.  It was recommended to me by several friends whose opinions I hold in high esteem.  Imagine my surprise when the first time I picked it up, I put it down ten minutes later.  I thought to myself, what is the big deal with this book?  It's boring... no, it's beyond boring.  I could not drag myself into the story.  I skipped over the book in my Kindle and moved on.  Several dozen books later, I was incented to pick the book up again.  And down it went 20 minutes later.<br /><br />Finally, a few weeks ago, I picked the book up for a third time, determined to make my way through it.  And I have to say, the first 200 pages are rough.  There is a story here, if you can make it through the tedious details and dry as paint plot foundation in the beginning.  Aside from the first 200 pages being tediously dull, I did have a hard time throughout the series keeping all of the names and locations straight in my head (similar to reading Ana Karenina).<br /><br />If you are among the few who make it through the first book, you will greatly enjoy the next two.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|The gem in this package is the must watch DVD. Listening to the people who created the Blues genre, many of whom are now deceased,  speaking from their own personal experiences provides a priceless blues history lesson. If you are unfamiliar with 'Blue Heaven Studios' this DVD provides a pretty good introduction to the world of audiophile recording studios. The last 3 tracks are filmed and recorded at Blue Heaven with truly great sonic results.    The other half of this package is the CD containing 15 tracks teaming Kenny with legendary blues artists from the Who's Who book of southern blues performers. No blues collection is complete without this CD/DVD combo.
B004MKLRUQ|1.0|I bought this book because I have been wondering about such issues for most of my life. I have never been able to understand the fascination of the Developed world with the undeveloped one. Rivers of money flow to undeveloped countries but nothing ever seems to change. Even when the Western world is struggling economically one thing never goes down, the amount of money given to poor countries. But.... it never seems to help!     After watching an interview with Dambisa Moyo on the Dutch TV I got interested in this book but.... one thing is clear, this lady may be very well educated but she is not a writer. Another thing is clear too, she is an African and as such is maybe not able to see reality as it is. Most of the ideas are not new. Even thought I had never read a book about this subject most of what I read here I knew already and her ideas of how to improve the situation are some good, some bad. I found that she talks too little about the huge amount of families (taxpayers), struggling in everyday life to give their children a better life and who have to pay for people in other countries as well. She mentions it briefly but I would have liked to hear more about it. What about all the hard working, decent, law abiding people who have difficulty making ends meet or barely make a living but are forced, whether they want it or not to send part of what they earn to other countries around the world? I would also have liked to have heard about why we send our money there in a big way but have to receive their people in our countries in a big way too! And after they come to our countries they send part of what they earn (when they are not living on benefits, that is....), back to their countries not benefiting our economies in the least but profiting from them big time. It all seems a big one way street which will never end. But Dambisa Moyo is a supporter of remittances not caring at all what this is doing to the same countries which have welcomed these people! But whyshould she care...... she is an African after all, still as the author of such a book she should have looked into all the detail and analyzed it in a realistic, impartial way. Then she is against countries subsidizing farmers. Aren't countries sovereign and therefore free to do whatever they find is best to protect their own people? No, according to her subsidies must end so that Africans can sell the products as well. In the end she is against aid, which is a good point of view but she still wants Africa to have it all, and that is wrong. African countries, for example, could trade among each others if they can't trade as much as they would like outside of their continent. This is a free world but she seems to have forgotten that. I think that we in the Western world have done more than enough to relieve poverty, now is up to the countries themselves to do it if that is what they want. Putting more money into the pockets of corrupt governments is not going to change a thing, she is right! And why is the Western world, so concerned with poverty and poor human rights records, fuelling corrupt, violent regimes in poor countries? I would have liked to read more about that as I don't know the answer.     One thing I discovered in this book, poor countries don't seem to be as poor as we might think, just people keep the gold and the money at home while sucking all they can from other countries, oblivious of the fact that someone, somewhere is struggling every day in order to supply them with more and more money. I was in Africa a few times and noticed that Africans seemed to see me as a source of easy goods. They would come up to me and demand that I give them my clothes, my hat, my shoes or whatever they fancied and where shocked when I didn't agree. That is how they see us, as the sugar daddies! And what about disaster relief? Every time it is like a circus on TV and people donate a lot of money, even those who can hardly afford it like pensioners, forgetting all themoney they already sent, even without noticing it, which has all gone to waste! Why are TV stations so keen to make people part with their money? Because it makes great disaster TV? And people are so very naïve that they go along with it!     Whether China is good for Africa I don't know and I couldn't care less, what I know is that aid needs to stop, immigration needs to stop and Africa needs to take responsibility for its own future. After all it is an enormously rich continent, let's not forget that!     I missed a chapter on over population, surely a problem in Africa and other poor countries. Why is so little done to reduce the population? Only because they supply us with a never ending source of cheap labour? That would solve a lot of problems and Dambisa Moyo is right, when the money is gone the corrupt governments will be too! This said I will look for another book on the subject as this one didn't answer many of my questions at all! Too much misleading marketing I believe....... but I could have guessed, this is a too important matter to treat in 154 pages!
B0049VZ222|5.0|One word awesome. As with any good horror film/show the inter-personal conflict among the characters pushes the narrative forward and shows that the most vengeful adversaries to the heroes are the other member of the group. The show portrays the differences in Americas social as stereotypes, but that is better than everyone being portrayed as the same single dimensional character. Worth watching over most other shows out-there.

B000803CRK|5.0|When I have discussions with people about the greatest album in rock history, this is the album I always pick. When you are talking about picking the best from tens of thousands of releases, it can be a huge task. Physical Graffiti is simply a true masterpiece! If you don't own this or if (God forbid) you have never heard this before, you are missing out on the finest moment in classic rock history. It's truly hard to put into words...just buy it!
0805047905|5.0|This is by far my son's favorite book, I must have read it hundreds of times already and he can't get enough! I tried the polar bear book as well, but my son was not as impressed. This book teaches about animals and colors- it is a nice read even if your child should choose to read it over, and over, and over again. Highly recommended!!!!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Out and about my exploration of classic Hollywood, its style and glamour, I watched \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", a film that actually started as a fluke.  The extras in the DVD offer both the script and takes of the original beginning, when Joe Gillis appears as a dead, talking corpse at the morgue.  But when audiences rejected this beginning almost violently, it was changed to the chase on the pavement that shows the street's name and the subsequent arrival of the Police at the address of a forgotten Hollywood icon by the name of Norma Desmond.  The body in the pool is our narrator, the dashingly handsome William Holden in his role as Joe Gillis.<br /><br />Described as a noir film, \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" tells the story of a Hollywood star of yesteryear whose madness knows no limits.  She is eccentric, which she can allow herself to be as she is immensely rich.  She lives in a house that is as luxurious as it is depressing, dark and stuffy, and which reminded me of the Addams family mansion.  Her only companion is her butler.  By pure chance, Joe Gillis, arrives at the house due to a flat tire.  He recognizes the star as Norma Desmond, who used to be in silent pictures, and \\"used to be big\\", he states.  \\"I am big\\", she responds.  \\"It's the pictures that got small.\\"  And with the line that has become a classic, she makes Gillis her employee cum lover cum prisoner, while she ostensibly hires him to help her re-write the picture she is planning to star in next - Salome.<br /><br />In \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" Gloria Swanson gives the performance of a lifetime.  I have never seen anybody else quite like her.  Her technique is that of a true professional.  She exaggerates gestures and words, yet does it exactly to the point where they can be believed without being grotesque.  This is the true mark of an excellent actor.  William Holden does not need to do much, although one can tell he has talent.  His role in this movie is to be a handsome gentleman, and he achieves this just due to the way he looks.  In my view, the movie is all Swanson.  She is just fantastic in every scene, and the costumes designed by Edith Head are magnificent.  She looks regal.<br /><br />I encourage viewers to watch the special feature where the film is played with the commentary of Ed Sikov in the foreground, and which explains the reasoning behind many of the takes, as well as trivia that we would not otherwise have known.  The additional featurettes about the making of the film and the composition of its score allow for further exploration into the creation of a true masterpiece.  Undoubtedly, a film like no other.n my view, the movie is all Swanson.  She is just fantastic in every scene, and the costumes designed by Edith Head are magnificent.  She looks regal.

B003UESJ9W|5.0|I really loved this movie. I went back and watched it again with my daughter and she liked it to. The music is great but so was the movie. It was about all 4 main people and how their lives were changed because of each other. It's a movie I plan to buy. I bought the cd after watching the movie. The music is really great.
B000FC2PKG|2.0|A fairly good novel marred by many gratuitous usages of Jesus Christ or Christ or Jesus as expletives.  Authors have a large choice of words to use as expletives that would not otherwise discomfort and cause wincing among those readers, including myself, who revere and honor Jesus Christ.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|This is a low key interesting movie. Lots of big name actors but no overacting. It's an enjoyable movie and worth watching.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Too often books as subtle as Ishiguro's \\"Never Let Me Go\\" dissolve in film form: temptation for yet another boy meets girl love story; unnecessary action thrown in for the sake of unnecessary action; swapping the sentimental for the profoundly emotional; gross simplification; contorting to meet formulaic character archetypes; jolly endings where none are remotely possible; and product placement demands (art 'n' commerce, baby). In this case, the film helped me better understand some of the central points of the book, points covered better elsewhere. With deftness worthy of the best art house auteurs, by remaining clear to its purpose, understated in its execution, subtle in its portrayal the profundity of Ishiguro's message arrives with disproportionately greater, devastatingly affecting force. An exemplary accomplishment, on par with the earlier and excellent \\"Remains of the Day\\", this time shorn of the details of an outer world, pared to the essentials of a form terrifying and beautiful.  If you haven't seen it yet, try it without the orienting text that opens the film, a practical gesture that proves to be the only sop given to convention in this otherwise thoroughly outstanding work.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Super,well done cds and DVD(s)!!!  If you went to one of these concerts--and we did--it was a great reminder of the experience.  If you didn't see one,you will at least feel like you have after watching this.  The song list is a \\"small\\" (33 tunes) taste of the great career of Paul McCartney.  Hes still a great performer.Well worth it to get the deluxe edition too.  Gave me a great place to put my concert tickets!  :)
B0006Q1ULQ|5.0|If you are a fan of Umberto Eco, then you will know what he is capable of as a writer. Baudolino is a great novel that is a change from some of his other works. This is a very good thing. I don't think we want our favorite writers producing variations of the same novel over and over again. This is as different as \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" is from \\"The Name of The Rose\\". Yet it is as thoroughly enjoyable and profoundly meaningful.    With a writer like Eco, there is more to his works than plot and pacing or characters. Ideas are central and there is no shortage of them in this work. The writing itself is also a joy to read.
B0000032LS|4.0|Can't get this in the stores anymore. Brings back memories of fish net stockings, wieners and yelling at a big screen.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was by chance. I'd never heard of it before and the title was weird but I was at someone else's home so what could I do. Low and behold, the movie was excellent. The acting superb and Chiwetel Ejiofor is extraordinary. When you go back and look at his other films, \\"Four Brothers\\" \\"Talk to Me\\" it makes you want to go back and look at Kinky Boots again and again. It's based on a real shoe factory outside of London, it's a movie everyone should see. I had to have a copy for myself because I got tired and (broke) from renting it. I give it 5-Stars.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|I knew this would be a shallow movie going in but I was mistaken that the 3D aspect would be able to compensate for that.  Worse, there were a lot of double lines in my Real 3D viewing of this movie and the 3D didn't pop or thrill or add anything to the movie.  As for the film, it was extremely violent but not giddily exessive enough to push this movie into the catagory of trashy pleasure.  In short, a man escapes hell to save the life of his granddaughter from a satanic cult with an \\"accountant\\" from hell on his tail to bring him (and a stolen God-killing gun)back.  Cage's character and everyone else was strictly comic book depth.  There was some humor in two performances -- the accountant and the heroine's fiance -- but there was a lot in this movie that made my eyes roll back in their sockets.  I'm glad some people enjoy this movie on the level it was intended but it left me annoyed and cold.  Piranha 3D was another bad movie but it went that step extra into excess that this movie didn't do, despite the many explosions and gunshot wounds.  Many will disagree with me but with respect, that's how this movie affected me.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|I belevie that this movie is the best movie of the year. James Franco was amazing and Danny Boyle has done it again. BUY IT!
B0001HAISG|3.0|The film itself is beautiful. However, there are sound issues with the DVD. The music cuts out/is lowered abruptly on a few occasions. For the price, I'm not complaining, but I'd definitely purchase a better product if it were available.
B0045HCJ6M|3.0|I first saw this movie years ago when it was in the theaters.  It was at a sad time in my life and watching it now brought back lots of memories I would like to forget.  I think the movie is too long and has too much singing or music, but of course it was a broadway musical.  I did enjoy seeing the young Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|Are you kidding me?  This went from a pretty good storyline about moral values to some kind of bad X-Files science fiction movie; one that made no sense and left everything openended.

0446563048|5.0|This book describes the importance of a healthy work environment REALLY well.  Spend the time to figure out the core identity of your organization and hire people and/or appoint board members who parallel that core identity.  I've experienced working for a good business who hired narcissistic people because of their competence and watched the morale and the quality of output go down.  I've also watched a founder of a wonderful organization get ousted by a new board of directors that ended up with a totally different value system than what the founder had.  This book is going to help me communicate the importance of figuring out the core identity and living/hiring/recruiting according to that core to the rest of my team in a way that will be easier to understand and be more convincing.  I'm excited!
0670022411|5.0|I've read some the the negative reviews about this book and for those who didn't know it was part one in a series it's your own fault, it says so on the inside dust jacket and in the review I read in a magazine that made me want to get it.    That being said, this was a great book, I couldn't put it down, yes it's a romance novel, but it is soooo much more then that.  It's action, adventure, fantasy, romance and humor all rolled into one.
3438052199|4.0|The Biblia Hebraica was exactly as described and arrived on time.  I was a little dismayed that the tag on the book left behind a slightly sticky mess when I removed it, but, for the price, I'm not complaining any more than that.
0670022411|5.0|I really enjoyed this story! The story opens with Diana, the young Witch who refuses to use magic, finding herself in possession of an ancient magical manuscript.  When she realizes it's power, she immediately returns it to the Librarian, however, it's too late to stop the series of events that have been unleashed by her actions.  It seems all of the magical creatures are stalking Diana, even though she did not truly research the manuscript and immediately returned it, she had opened pandoras box. One of the \\"creatures\\" who is watching her is a handsome Vampire, and she becomes very involved with him.<br />The book is well written, and the characters are very well developed with each having their own unique identity and contribution to the story.  From her Vampire Love Matthew, to her childhood home which has a life and personality of it's own, you'll enjoy meeting Vampires, Witches, and Daemons, and become immersed as they join together to solve the mystery of the magical manuscript, as well as protect Diana.  Along the way she discovers why she shunned her magical powers, and why she is one of, if not the most powerful Witch alive.<br />This is Book 1 of a series, and it will be hard to wait for the next book in 2012.  I recommed this book, I think you'll enjoy it!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This was another in a group we purchased of this group. Had seen them perform on PBS on TV and truly enjoyed their versatility and voices. They have many CD's on the market and each one is a gem in its own right.  A quality recording of Celtic Woman music. I highly recommend it.   Listen to the soundtrack bites when available. This is a perfect way to see if the CD is exactly what you were looking for. As with many performers each CD can be totally different from what you are used to hearing from that specific performer.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, I've been kind of going through a reading lull. It's been quite awhile since I actually read a book that I enjoyed and this was it! I couldn't put it down, and I even lost sleep so I could read it. I'm working on number 2 right now, which will not disappoint either.
B000002OX3|3.0|Now I know why I avoided the Who's first couple albums my entire life- this stuff is average at best. Back in 1966, what artists such as the Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Hollies, and Dylan were doing absolutely *smears* the horrible datedness and fruity bubblegum pop of the Who's A Quick One. This album has several other problems as well.     It was recorded poorly and, as a result, sounds severely rough around the edges. You definitely won't hear that loud, majestic sound that was found on future Who albums (and arguably mastered on Quadrophenia).     The 9-minute \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" resembles a series of nursery rhymes strung together, and seeing as how this was intended as a joke by the band members due to the fighting issues that were supposedly running rampant during the recording of this album, it really *does* come across as a joke... a terrible joke that we are the unfortunate victims of. I swear one part of this childish-like \\"suite\\" sounds like \\"Go Tell It On the Mountain\\". Is this really the same band that created classics like \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"We Won't Get Fooled Again?\\" You'd never guess.     Now, I don't have a *huge* problem with bubblegum pop. Much of it is pretty disposable to me however because it tends to lose its magic after only a few listens (which is definitely the *extreme* polar opposite of how I approach the bands rock operas) but the thing is, the Who has a lot of distinct features to their overall sound and style, and most of it is completely missing here. Where's Moon's outrageously loud drumming? It either hasn't been developed yet or he felt it wasn't necessary for this album. Where's Daltrey's beautiful vocal melodies that bring me to tears? It's not here either. Loud, earth shattering guitar riffs that rumble the floorboards courtesy of Townshend? Sorry, not on this one.     I realize the year is 1966 and rock bands all across Europe and America were still developing their style, but still, it doesn't change the reason I fell in love with the Who in the first place- everything I mention in the paragraph above.  At the very least, I was hoping these songs would be melodic and exciting with decent vocal melodies, but I honestly fail to hear anything memorable about the majority of this album.     So to summarize the entire album- the production is terrible and apparently no remixing or remastering in the world can save it, the songwriting is disappointing because the band intended the album to be a joke so there was no reason for them to write memorable and honest vocal melodies, and there's not really any distinct elements of the bands sound that would make them not only famous, but legendary.   To put it another way, there's nothing here that the Who Sell Out or Tommy wouldn't do much *much* better.  At least the bubblegum pop on the Who Sell Out actually contains quality songwriting.    Instead, a Quick One feels like a collection of short nursery rhyme-type pop songs that don't move me one way or another. I can't bring myself to give it an overall rating of anything less than 3 stars simply because I wouldn't feel right about it, but it probably deserves a 2. It's weak.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|Other folks have written, I believe, very good synopses and reviews of the content of the book, so I'll not go there.  All I would like ot add is that, while I enjoyed the story itself, the Kindle edition of the content seems unfinished.  I own the paperback as well and, relative to it, there are a LOT of typos, wrong words, blank spaces and, at one point, what seems like a plot summary instead of text (it looked a like a note someone would write to themselves about what they meant to happen next if they didn't have time to actually write it out).  It honestly feels like when the publishers decided to hop on the Kindle bandwagon, they just grabbed any digital copy of the book they could find and 'published' it.  Unfortunately, it seems they grabbed on that hadn't gone to editing yet.  It's not that big of a deal, really, but when they are charging more for a digital copy than the cover price on the print version, I would at least expect it to be an apparently-finished version.

0765326353|5.0|It took me some dedicated reading to really get into this book.  There are 4 major protagonists two of which have exceedingly awful lives to work through and the other two.....well, ya gotta read it.  Additionally, the world portrayed here is one of the roughest, most challenging and slow to be revealed that I've encountered..there is a huge \\"backstory\\" of ancient history and character-lives so it takes awhile just to figure out what is actually going on in the \\"big picture\\" as well as what alot of the basic customs are and mean..some unusual stuff going on there....I've been reading fantasy and SiFi since the '50s and this one has way more than your average of intriquing \\"mysteries\\" as well.... you know they are there, but most are not openly revealed in this book.    But by about the 1/2 way mark I was hooked.  Now that I've finished it, I'm already looking for the next book as the continuation of a really good read.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|An absolute stunner of a movie. A thoroughly believeable plotline (unlike Black Swan) accompanied by power packed performances by absolutely every character in the movie regardless of their screen time and an especially stirring performance by Jennifer Lawrence makes this movie a must-watch. This movie is realistic without being overly dark and twisted which is the mark of a nice job!

B004FEFZU2|3.0|OK, first off let me say that I own all of the SAW movies, and have seen them in the theaters; needless to say, I'm a big fan.   I knew going in to this movie that it was going to be slim on the revelations factor seeing as how this is SAW 7 and we've pretty much figured out absolutely every thing there is to figure out in this saga. Of course, the only thing left was the issue with Dr. Gordon... Did he make it out? Was he alive? etc...    In the first 5 minutes of the film, that's answered. Then a ridiculous set of traps begin which really have no purpose in the film except to fill the time. Honestly, the movie could have been trimmed down to about 30 minutes. Really this movie was just milking the franchise for another couple million.

0316010669|4.0|The working of the human mind, one of the oldest mysteries remains the largest, most bizarre of frontiers. From the very beginning men like Freud and Wundt have been trying to unravel this mystery. They have attempted to map out and stake a claim on this measureless frontier. While we have came a long way and we do know more about \\"knowing\\" than we have in the past, there remains a great deal that we are ignorant of.   Malcolm Gladwell uses Blink to stake his claim in the frontier of the human psyche. His book arrives as a fresh and interesting proposal about how we make decisions, process information, and take in the world around us. Gladwell, staff writer for The New Yorker and author of The Tipping Point, beautifully weaves together anecdotes, research, personal experience and interviews in order to prove his suggestion that the human mind processes information much faster than we are consciously aware of. Gladwell's first anecdote proves his point nicely; he tells the story of a Greek sculpture called a kouros. The owner of the kouros wanted ten million dollars for the statue which he claimed was from the sixth century. The J. Paul Getty Museum launched an investigation; fourteen months and many tests later they believed that the statue was authentic and purchased it. However, as soon as the statue went on display it was obvious that something was amiss-- every expert in Greek art who looked at the statue immediately felt that it was \\"wrong\\". One even going so far as to say he felt an \\"intuitive repulsion\\" after looking at the statue for only two or three seconds. At the end of the story it is discovered the statue is indeed a fraud. Gladwell states that our \\"adaptive unconscious\\" uses a process that he calls \\"thin slicing\\". This process is where our brain takes in a small amount of information in a very short time and arrives at a complex, and many times correct, hypothesis. However, Gladwell also shows \\"our unconscious is a powerful force. But it's fallible\\"Gladwell brings out the \\"mind reading\\" parts of thin slicing \\"are subtle and complex\\" and \\"sometimes goes terribly awry.\\" In the case of Amadou Diallo it went very wrong indeed. Diallo ,a black man from Guinea, lived in the Bronx. On the night of February 3, 1999, four plain clothes police officers mistakenly identified Diallo as a known rapist. As they approached him, he ran inside of a building and pulled a black object from his pocket. He was gunned down by the four police men. The black object was only wallet and the four police men had just experienced the dark side of thin slicing and snap decision making.   Gladwell goes on to prove his proposal by interlacing many other anecdotes and research involving war games, gamblers, former president Warren Harding, and even rock and roll musicians.   Gladwell uses a clever set up, a thorough introduction and is precise in proving his theory. He does a fantastic job in all aspects related to his proposal about our subconscious. While his use of research gives his proposal credibility Blink is far from a boring unimaginative list of statistics. His masterful use of a wide range of anecdotes and interviews invites the reader to continue exploring the topic. Gladwell's idea about the human mind and the way it operates is complete and made believable. Gladwell's writing style and presentation of facts creates the feel that you are having an intriguing and enjoyable conversation. His writing style and the organization of his information really adds to the appeal of his book, his proposal, and the likeability of Gladwell himself.
B002AOWXO0|2.0|In a sense, this album is appropriately titled and arranged, because the performers sound like they're totally bored with each other.  Yorn yanks out a few recycled rock riffs and yawns his vocals, while Johansson sings like she's doing her nails at the mic.  With only nine songs and a thirty-minute playing time, this set suggests it's trading on a name cachet in the hope of marketing an early-morning studio attempt after a prior night's bad idea.  Throughout the lackluster Break Up, Yorn needs to wake up, and Johansson needs more makeup.  Otherwise, why bother?
0393338827|4.0|Michael Lewis (\\"Liar's Poker,\\" \\"The Blind Side\\") writes with an eye for the good story, and \\"The Big Short\\" tells one.  The financial collapse of 2007-08 gave millions of Americans (and others) a financial punch to the gut, but a few . . . a very select few . . . saw the crisis coming and managed to make fortunes off of it.  In this book, Lewis finds some of these farsighted men and women and tells their story - how could these people see the impending calamity that our Financial Best and Brightest claimed they could not possibly have anticipated?    The answer, according to Lewis, is pure common sense and elbow grease.  The financial mess exploded because there was nobody In Charge who understood the corrupt, unsustainable system we had created through deregulation, the explosion of subprime lending, the creation of diabolically-dense financial instruments, and the corruption of the ratings agencies (Moody's, S&P, etc.).  There were, however, thousands of people making money hand-over-fist from the Ponzi scheme that this all turned into, but each person seemed to understand only their little segment of the overall transaction and how they could make millions off of it.      A very few people, such as Dr. Michael Burry (who studied the markets in the evenings while marking time at Stanford Medical School) and Steve Eisman, a misanthrope incapable of hiding his contempt for the subprime system and all its denizens, undertook the seeming Herculean task of understanding the entire Byzantine system, from originating horribly high-risk mortgages (to generate fees) to the immediate sale of those mortgages (to generate fees and pass the risk along to someone else) to the repackaging of those mortgages into securities (to generate fees and pass the risk along to someone else) to the repackaging of those securities into new securities (to generate fees and pass the risk along to someone else).  And so it was that a handful of investors were able to see that the terrible mortgages issued in 2005 to berry pickers and unemployed nannies were going to result in a spectacular round of defaults by 2007, and that every major financial institution on Wall Street was infected with the risk of these defaults.    Indeed, as D-day (default day) loomed, the biggest concern was not that the crisis would not occur, but that it would be so massive that the government would step in and prevent the collapse, and these investors would have been ruined.    Lewis tells the stories of these brilliant individuals - who had the courage to swim against a current generated by the entire Wall Street establishment, which was convinced that this system would never, ever fail - with humor and sensitivity.  Never salacious but always insightful, Lewis brings his characters to life in such a compelling way that a book featuring such bizarre terms as shorting the market, credit derivatives and credit default swaps becomes downright riveting.    The library of excellent books analyzing the recent financial crisis is growing by leaps and bounds, and deservedly so.  I give this book four stars because while it is accessible and provides a high-level review of the financial collapse, I do not believe the book gives a clear picture of the overall financial debacle.  For such a book, look to \\"Too Big to Fail\\" or \\"All the Devils Are Here.\\"  But once you understand (as well as is humanly possible) the financial collapse, reading Lewis's book is a joy because it is so focused on the Little Guys - guys who did not have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs or the other Wall Street elite - and nevertheless beat them all at their own game.    Unfortunately, for these guys to win, everyone else had to lose.

B002U5HKZ6|1.0|Haven't read the book, but would love to.    So why the 1 star rating?     Because this book, and many, many, others are not available to Kindle users in South Africa (among other places).    Amazon says it is due to Publisher/Author copyright restrictions, but the irony is that the Hardcover and Softcover books are available, so how does this work then??    Nothing more irritating than hearing about a good read then to find that it's not available to you because you're registered in South Africa.    If I'd known about this before buying my Kindle, I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|A drama/biography/musical from 1952? My wife just wasn't interested. But I insisted that there's no film like the original (i.e. the REAL) \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" It's a biography of the renown French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec from the late 1890s who had very short legs and grew to stand only about 4'11\\" due to an accident and bone disease. Although he was from an aristocratic family he chose to live alone in Paris to pursue his art career. He would spend time at a local cabaret, Moulin Rouge, where he'd find inspiration for his art, as well as fuel for his increasing alcoholism.<br /><br />Although Henri (Jos&eacute; Ferrer) was brilliant artistically & intellectually, he understandably had a poor self-image due to his dwarfism, which was constantly reinforced by various mean-spirited people. Yet, he discovers love for the first time when he meets a spirited woman bred in the cobblestone jungles of Paris (Colette Marchand). Will this love enhance his life or ultimately poison him? I'll leave that for you to discover.<br /><br />INTERESTING ITEMS:<br /><br />- The opening dance hall sequences are highlighted by Katherine Kath (the redhead) and a young Zsa Zsa Gabor.<br />- Jos&eacute; Ferrer is great as the protagonist with his commanding voice and interesting dialogues. His commentaries on life are brilliant and brutally honest, but also cynical.<br />- The viewer REALLY wants to see Henri find true love, happiness and victory, despite his deformity, but his cynicalism and alcoholism sadly enshroud him.<br />- The story is both entertaining AND thought-provoking. My wife & I had some good discussions after the film. For instance, real-life people & couples that the story brought to mind, the nature of existence as \\"unattractive\\" and unloved, missed opportunities thrown in our laps due to poor self-image and addictions, being a \\"has been\\" and a \\"continue to be,\\" etc.<br />- There's another significant female character who shows up in the third act, but I'm not sure of her name (in the movie or real life). In any event, the viewer will notice that she's NOT embarrassed to appear with Henri in public like the erratic Marie Charlet. This is an important part; take note.<br /><br />Since the film is a biography it could only end one way, but I won't spoil it for you if you're not familiar with the true story.<br /><br />The film was shot in Paris and England and runs 2 hours.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Make no mistake, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a masterpiece. There's really nothing else like it. It's the perfect antidote to modern 'blockbuster' drek. Disregard the fact that it was released in 1952, particularly if you have a distaste for old movies, as \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a timeless film both hugely entertaining and thought-provoking, not to mention REAL. After watching my wife expressed how much she liked the film and thanked me because she would have never chosen it on her own.<br /><br />GRADE: A+nt, the viewer will notice that she's NOT embarrassed to appear with Henri in public like the erratic Marie Charlet.

0679746048|5.0|Alright, I know this book has been around for awhile and it was made into a movie but I only recently came across it. As usual, I typically go by recommendations of people that I know. Since this book has been extensively reviewed, I will just indicate that I really got myself hooked on this book and anything that I read that I don't want to put down gets 5 stars automatically. That's just how I feel about it. This one is a gem so if you haven't read it yet, go for it.
B003UESJFG|5.0|My wife and I bought this for our 3 year old twins, and were incredibly pleasantly surprised. The story line is written perfectly to captivate and entertain an adult, while yet being fun enough, graphically pleasing enough (lots of explosions, action, jokes, etc.) to keep even young children entertained.    Would definitely recommend this to anyone with small children, or just for anyone who enjoys a well told story, with good character development and a poignant ending.

I love their old work, and this album is a fine addition to their vast and masterful catalogue. and to thy nay sayers; let's see you put a band together and do what Dimmu has done. I garuntee your result's will not be so great. then again, the next great symphonic metal group may be waiting in the shadows, hungering for blood...
B003L20ICO|5.0|The Kids are all Right is the best comedy I've seen. Is not a laugh per minute comedy like The Hangover or Tropic Thunder, is a more subdue one that also has its elements of drama. This is a story of two \\"moms\\" who have two kids and live as a family. Everything seems to be okay until the kids meet the sperm donor and things get complicated.<br /><br />This movie could easily be called a movie about a lesbian couple with kids but it's not. It's about family and marriage in general regardless the gender of the parents. There are many situations in the film that any family experiences (gay or straight). Lisa Cholodenko's script is brilliant and handles this in a masterful way. The movie could have been seem as a \\"message movie\\" about gay rights but it's nothing of the sort. Is much more simple and at the same time complicated. The movie deals with themes like rutine, raising children, letting go, infidelity, recovery and a lot more. \\"marriage is hard\\" says Jules one of the \\"moms\\" and she's right there are ups and lows in every relationship and to keep the spark alive requires sacrifices. This movie is witty, emotional, and funny. It's no wonder why it got all the accolades it got. It deserved it. Also the cast is superb with the three leads Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo giving outstanding performances in their respective roles. The Kids are all Right is a great film and one of the best of last year.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers great picture and audio quality. Being an independent comedy, don't expect colors popping out of your screen but the picture is solid, contrast is sharp and detail is really good. Audio is also crisp and clear with a 5.1 DTS-HD master audio that won't rock your house but serves the film in an excellent way.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the BD has great P/A quality, there's no much in terms of bonus features. One would think that with all the positive reviews and awards that the film got, Universal will make a much worthier release. Instead you have three really short featurettes about the film that are promotional and never got in depth about the story, characters or anything. The best bonus feature is an audiocomentary provided by the director Lisa Cholodenko.<br /><br />The Kids are All Right is a superb smart picture that has a great story, an outstanding script and a brilliant cast.

0307388921|5.0|I'm not an avid reader.  At all.  I'm one of the guys who saw a movie and wanted to pick up the book to compare and be able to finally tell people \\"Yeah, the book is bla bla bla compared to the movie.\\"  Maybe this will give me a point in credibility to my hipster friends.      I must say that I'm glad to have picked this title up.  The movie isn't for everybody.  The book isn't for everybody.  This is because the story isn't for everybody.  If you are like me and enjoy dark humor with a psychological twist and are not easily offended then this story is for you.  For more detail about what this story is actually about then read the amazon review or one of the many other reviews.      To get to the book specifically (while catering to those who are like me and admittingly do not read often), I will say this was a great casual read.  It was fun flipping through the pages with the movie in mind and comparing mental notes about accuracy and placement of the story.  Since I was going into this book with very little care to the translation from book to film I wasn't disappointed.  In fact I felt it was a great supplement to the movie.  Yes, some charactors aren't portrayed exactly alike.  No, the ending isn't the same, it's quite different.  But what a great ride it was.  Plus, for a casual reader such as myself the fact that the 304 page book is broken up into many chapters averaging 4 to 7 pages, makes it a great \\"pick up, put down\\" or \\"toilet read.\\"    This book sparks my interest enough to actually start reading more books, and of course starting with another title by Chuck.  Maybe Fight Club, but I would like to read another title that isn't accompanied by a movie.  I'm curious to see what goes through my mind without the mental images a film director and actors already fed me.    Pick it up.  You'll know if you like it just by clicking the \\"look inside\\" option anyway.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm sorry, does Lucasfilm think that people will buy anything just because it has Star Wars written on it?<br />Well, maybe they're right but I'm certainly not among them.<br /><br />I already have the 2004 dvd versions with Hayden Christensen in Jedi, Boba Fett sounding like a goofy clown instead of an intimidating and mysterious figure, a drastically darkened look overall with a strange blue tint, other gaffes like pink lightsabers and a botched soundtrack.<br />Not to mention all the crap that was added in 1997 including a pointless contradictory scene with Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars, an even more pointless set of Return of the Jedi outtakes added to the end of Empire disrupting the pacing, Greedo shooting at Han Solo and can you say \\"new musical number in Jabba's Palace?\\"<br /><br />As it appears right now, the blu-ray will be the EXACT SAME 2004 versions with all the gaffes and bad alterations, except it will be in HD resolution.

Because of the weird color screwups and other errors (the rear surround channels are swapped on A New Hope), that alone is more than enough justification for 1 star.<br /><br />I don't know about you but it doesn't seem worth $70 ($45 amazon sale price) just to upscale the versions I already have and don't want.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Do we really need another 600 pages of \\"Twilight\\"?  The main character, Diana, starts out as a well educated, well respected, self sufficient witch with a puritanical desire to suppress all her powers. I still don't know how the author managed to turn her into a damsel in distress.  Do we really need to see her getting rescued innumerable times by the sexy vampire?  Do readers really fantasize about playing house with a dark and brooding vampire?   Do females really want to have vampire babies that much that there has to be two series with the same plot line?  The only thing missing was the werewolf competing for her affections.    On the plus side, the author brings a educated sensibility to the historical background of the story although Jane Austin might have asked for royalties for the scenes in the castle (horseback riding, winning over the mother-in-law).  And though you can't tell from this review, the story had some exciting points amid the clutter and inevitable slow-downs.  But be warned, there's no ending...it's just a set-up for book 2.

B000JCSBU0|5.0|I just watched REQUIEM FOR A DREAM this morning and have two seemingly contradictory things to say about it: (1) It's one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. (2) I'm reasonably sure I'm never going to want to see it again. Director Darren Aronofsky orchestrates every element of this cinematic meditation on the horrors of drug addiction so perfectly that I was completely overwhelmed. I watch a lot of ultraviolent and explicit films (Tarantino, Scorsese, and Abel Ferrera are among my favorites) but this one was hard to take even for me. Highly, highly recommended, but, as they say, caveat emptor.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Since 2009, I became engrossed in detective novels (and crime fiction in general). I love how hard-boiled and gritty most of the books that I've read were, and I love how there's a lot of realism in the stories. In cinema, I never really had the heart to feel intrigued with many of the noirs that have been released over the years. But now, they've grown on me. L.A. Confidential is one that has grown better after repeated viewings. It's a slick, gritty, and completely mature neo-noir that deals with Hollywood, politics, prostitution, and pornography. It also focuses on racism mainly in the second act. While the story is engaging, the characters are also memorable. Marvelous performances from Pearce, Spacey, Crowe, Basinger, Cromwell, and Devito. Dialogue is sharp, and plot twists are almost unpredictable. The music is just right, and the violence is fitting. This movie is critically acclaimed, and it deserves the praise. This is a brilliant movie.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5/10

The only thing that bothered me was that the story is told through the eyes of Jack, who is only 5 years old.  Some of the dialogue was hard to follow, and the fact that he didn't know the correct name for objects outside the room made it even more difficult to follow.  Overall this was an excellent story, and hard to put down until you've reached the end.
1439107955|5.0|Let me get this out of the way right away.  Siddhartha Mukherjee's \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is probably the most important book you'll read this year, and maybe this decade.  Unless you're an oncologist, you will certainly learn an enormous amount about this terrible disease that affects almost everyone on the planet if not directly then indirectly through family, friends, and so on.  And what's truly amazing about it is that the book is almost compulsively readable--actually a page turner, despite the fact that it's not easy reading at all and clearly not dumbed down for a popular audience.<br />  Mukherjee is a reliable and brilliant guide, taking us through the whole history of the illness, from its first reported manifestations in antiquity, though the latest treatments just now being experimented with. He describes cancer as a kind of doppelganger to our healthy lives, fighting for its own survival as it destroys its host: \\"Cancer is an expansionist disease; it invades through tissues, sets up colonies in hostile landscapes, seeking'sanctuary' in one organ then immigrating to another.  It lives desperately, inventively, fiercely, territorially, cannily, and defensively--at times, as if teaching us how to survive.  To confront cancer is to encounter a parallel species, one perhaps more adapted to survival than even we are.\\" Mukherjee escorts us through various phases of the treatment for the disease and demonstrates how are understanding of it has changed very significantly in the past few decades.<br />  \\"Cancer, we have discovered,\\" Mukherjee writes, \\"is stitched into our genome.  Oncogenes [genes which allow cancer to flourish] arise from mutations in essential genes that regulate the growth of cells. Mutations accumulate in these genes when DNA is damaged by carcinogens, but also by seemingly random errors in copying genes when cells divide.\\"  In the first case, the disease is preventable when we remove ourselves from exposure to carcinogens (as for example, giving up cigarettes) but the random errors are part of our own biology. \\"We can rid ourselves of cancer, then, onlyu as much as we can rid ourslves of the processes in our physiology that depend on growth--aging, regeneration, healing, reproduction.\\"  This sounds like bad news, but scientists have made terrific progress against specific cancers--types of leukemia, prostate cancer, and even certain kinds of breast cancer. In fact, so much progress has been made in the past few decades, that John Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA wrote in 2009, \\"...an ambitious goal for the next decade [would be] the development of new drugs that will provide lifelong cures for many....Beating cancer now is a realistic ambition because, at long last we largely know its true genetic and chemical characteristics.\\"<br />  Mukherjee concludes that future cancer research will expand the kinds of treatments available; no longer will patients have to choose between a poisonous chemotherapy, a disfiguring surgery or the time bomb of radiation.  More pinpointed medicines that reverse genetic mutations and treat the very core of the disease are being developed and are actually being used in many specific cancers.  Mukherjee is not blindly optimistic.  He is aware of the limitations of science against this formidable enemy.  But he writes with grace, clarity, and persuasiveness about this very harrowing condition.  It's not by any means an easy read, but it is a necessary one.ample, giving up cigarettes) but the random errors are part of our own biology. \\"We can rid ourselves of cancer, then, onlyu as much as we can rid ourslves of the processes in our physiology that depend on growth--aging, regeneration, healing, reproduction.\\"  This sounds like bad news, but scientists have made terrific progress against specific cancers--types of leukemia, prostate cancer, and even certain kinds of breast cancer.

B000JQU4TW|4.0|I must have read this book several times through out my lifetime and it never gets old. I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain
B001MEJY8W|1.0|I would go as far to say that if you liked this movie, I don't want to know you.  Period.  The people who came up with this idiocy obviously have no souls.  The premise is utterly stupid - this is torture porn of the worst kind, because it attempts to have a point.  There is no sympathetic character here, there is no fight... the main character simply gives in to whatever is happening.  This movie attempts to glorify submission in the face of abuse, like saying oh no ladies you just have to learn how to transcend it when your husband is beating you each day don't bother fighting, and degrade humanity in any form (such as being traumatized or reacting like a caged animal when finally freed from years of torture instead of attempting to stay alive... I mean honestly, if you've seen this piece of trash, who the hell would want to?).  The only saving grace is that nobody is raped.<br /><br />The whole martyr twist was obviously an excuse, and does not feel like it had anything to really do with what happens.  This is just BS that is dangerous because it is riding in the disguise of being \\"philosophical\\".  After watching I had to really work on not letting this movie get stuck in my head, I felt like I had to wash my brain, and it made me sick that anyone would make this let alone watch it and think it was \\"thought provoking\\".  And it's not the gore.  At all.  I love gore, I just hate pseudophilosophical garbage.
B002VECLVO|2.0|As the movie plodded along I found myself not caring how the film ended.  But in the end I found some of the existentialism to be rewarding, if not particularly worth wading through the film for.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|This is an excellent product. It not only can add controls for a second engine (and with removable knobs, one can correctly arrange throttle throttle prop prop mix mix), but it also adds 9 additional buttons to control things like lights and master switches. For the price, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a realistic multi-engine sim experience.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I have loved Adrien Brody in just about everything I've seen him in, and Cadillac Records wasn't an exception. Beyonce played the part of Etta James to perfection, and I doubt anyone else could have played Muddy Waters with such success but Jeffery Wright. Not appropriate to watch with the kids but an excellent movie for adults. Get immersed in the age of blues and the birth of rock and roll.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this series. Very real and gritty but also very powerful. It can get very emotional when they show actual testimony from soldiers who served in Easy Company. Highly Recommended!
B000ZMVAXO|4.0|It serves its purpose. Sound is very good and has enough clean sound volumen. I Wish VOX  had one with three different sound effect options in one amp alone. I recommend it. With this  amp. you won't bug anybody neither you will die alone.
055358894X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I mean really really enjoyed it. It was witty, interesting, unique and unpredictable. The characters were facinating, detailed and amusing. The details were what made them real for me. Many of the people wear glasses, for instance. I also appreciate the strong female characters in every facet of politics, social status, leadership, warrior status and underworld. The world itself was really unique and interesting. I read a lot of books, and its bene a very long time that I was so thuroughly engulfed and surprised by one. But, it was the sarcasm and wit that won me over. I found myself giggling or laughing outloud in delight in places. I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. I resently read Peter Hamilton's Judas Unchained, and I gave that 5 stars. I thought this book was twice as good.    I bought the audible audio version. The reader's voice is perfect. Great inflection and voice deliniation - perfect for the characters and the sarcasm in this book. The female and child voices aren't nasal like some reader's make them.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Although the first shipment failed to arrive, my initial call to Amazon's Customer Service Dept. resulted in a second shipment that was sent the very next day! And I'm please to say that did arrive. Amazon's Customer Service response was a very enjoyable experience! It is the first time that I've not received something that I've ordered thru Amazon, and their - no questions asked - just \\"how may I help you\\" response was truly enjoyable! Kudos to Amazon!

B004A8ZWT2|2.0|The beautiful city of Venice and the plump lips of Jolie under the knife of the bad guy were the only good things in this movie.  I just could not believe that these two amazing stars made such an unimportant movie.  Such shallow dialogue and such unrealistic characters.  Especially the main bad guy.  The choking scene was just unbelievable.  Literally.  I can not help but think that this movie was only good for adding another 20 or so million dollars to Depp's and Jolie's bank accounts.
B000002WPI|1.0|What the hell?? I got my all time favorite hip-hop album and what a disappointment!!! Protect ya Neck is censored!!! They put this funny noise when they say the 'bad words'!!! The thing is Amazon's product info said explicitly EXPLICIT LYRICS!!! Come on!!!!!! Had it been the real deal I would have most definitely rated the product FIVE stars!! What a disappointment...    It even features the Parental Advisory thing on the cover!
0553582038|4.0|3.5 Stars rounded up to 4.    You're probably aware that Martin decided to split his original manuscript for this book into two separate books due to size constraints. Rather than choose to divide the novel into a \\"Part 1\\" and a \\"Part 2\\", arranged more or less chronologically, he decided to tell the stories of roughly half the characters in this book and to tell the other simultaneous stories of the other half in the upcoming A Dance With Dragons.    This book on its own is well-written and enjoyable but ultimately unfulfilling and a bit aggravating.     A few minor gripes: --This book focuses on characters that I don't particularly care for...that being said, you may.     --The book could be subtitled \\"Much Ado About Little\\" since it wastes so many words to advance the plot in such a minor manner. (It calls into question whether Martin could have pared this book by half and kept the entire story together as one novel.)    --What cliffhangers we do get in this book likely won't be resolved until the volume following A Dance With Dragons (unless Martin throws us a few bones in the final chapters as a reward for waiting so long...if he doesn't and the volume after Dance takes another 6 years, readers could potentially spend 12 years waiting to find out what happens to the characters at the end of Feast).     --It's too early to tell since Dance isn't out yet, but it seems that the job of keeping track of scores of characters, what they know and when they knew it, and how each piece of knowledge drives their actions is going to be made much more difficult by splitting these two simultaneous stories into separate books. (I hope Martin proves me wrong here.)    I like the book. I enjoyed it. But I feel it was a major mistake to split the story up in this fashion. (Purely speculative...but I have to wonder if addressing some of these concerns and attempting to avoid inconsistencies is what has taken Martin so long to finish Dance. If that's the case, I wonder whether Martin regrets splitting the story in this fashion.)     Martin anticipated some backlash when he wrote on his website the suggestion that those unhappy with the split \\"Get both books, razor the pages out with an Exacto knife, interleave the chapters as you think best...\\" Depending on how Dance handles some of my concerns, I may end up doing just that.    Bottom line: recommended...but if you've waited this long, wait for Dance to be published so you can read the full story together.
B001EC3JME|2.0|As near as I can tell, this is a great product if you have fairly specific needs.  It is not the do-all flashlight sheath it claims to be.      Here's how it breaks down:  The sheath is designed to stretch to fit, up to, a D cell flashlight, and keep it snuggly on your hip.  It will do this.  However, it is very snug.  Any flashlight larger than a Mini Maglight will be difficult to deploy with one hand. I tried to fit my Fenix E-21, which isn't that much bigger than a Mini, and it really took two hands and a few seconds.  Furthermore,  no flashlight, including a Mini-Mag, just slips into the holster without a little fiddling (although I think a little practice with a Mini Mag would fix this problem).      The click rotating clip is really nifty, and I could see it being very useful.  If this is the feature you most want, then you can't do better.  The clip rotates easily and it is very secure.  In fact, it is a little too secure, in that, it is a little awkward to put on and take off of a belt.      Also remember, there is no flap on this holster.  Your flashlight is exposed on both ends.    It's cordura and seems to be super durable.  The price-point seems about right.     So, if you need the rotating clip, need your flashlight to be very secure on your belt, and/or use a Mini Maglight, I think this product is about right.  However, if you regularly take your flashlight out of its sheath, or use a any flashlight larger than a Mini, I think you can do much better.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I am reviewing maybe prematurely, the new Starz series Camelot based on a sneak preview for subscribers I had the FUN of viewing over the weekend. I enjoyed seeing the beautiful and always \\"mysterious\\" Eve Green as Morgana and Joseph Fiennes in the role of Merlin. This saga starts out with a familiar story line which might be my only criticism....just seemed similar to Pillars of the Earth to me right down to some almost stereotypical medieval characters....the story however is facinating enough that if you enjoy the legend of King Arthur as I do, you'll be inrigued enough to want to tune in. Starz says this sereis will start in April 2011.<br />Enjoy....hopefully the rest of it is as Tempting as the sneak preview.<br /><br />Atreides
B0006GVJEE|4.0|I've ordered 2 copies of this DVD and have suffered the same disapointment with both of them.  NO audio.  Its quite bizzare.  When the main menu is up there is the background music and so forth, but anywhere in the movie there is no sound, no audio.. Never have had this problem with any other DVD i've rented or purchased.  The video is all there and seems just fine.  Sigh, now sending this second copy back to amazon.
B0028RXXE8|1.0|The first six discs in this movie box are so badly scratched,  they cannot be played.  Wasted my money.  Very sorry I purchased this boxed set.  This is my first bad experience in the many years of purchasing through  Amazon.
B000002OHF|5.0|There seems to a major dicovery/re-discovery of 1970s music among today's 15-25 year olds. Many of them tell me they consider most of today's new music to be total rubbish (no argument from me on that point) and that they consider 1970s music to far superior to today's new releases.<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970s and I now find myself being repeatedly asked by my friends' teenaged sons and their friends for recommendations of 1970s bands they're not familiar with. They all know about Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and other major acts but they're totally unfamiliar with many of the lesser known 1970s bands.<br /><br />To help them and others who are discovering/rediscovering 1970s music I'll start posting reviews of albums by some of these less well known 1970s bands whose music I think is worth the attention of a new generation of listeners.<br /><br />Wishbone Ash is one such lesser known 1970s band. Great guitar band.<br /><br />This is my favorite Wishbone Ash album. It's probably their most commercial release. I know the word \\"commercial\\" in a review is probably the kiss of death for the review's credibility but by \\"commercial\\" I mean this album had the widest audience appeal of Wishbone's releases. Wishbone Ash was known as a progressive or \\"prog-rock\\" band and tended to have a smaller but very dedicated fan base; this album seemed to find a wider audience outside Wishbone's usual fans.<br /><br />It deserves a wider audience. Great album. Great guitar work. Highly recommended if you're exploring lesser known 1970s bands.
0439023521|5.0|A cross between Roman Gladiators and the TV show Survivor, only set in the future, and played until there really is only one LIVING survivor out of 24 contestants. Collins creates a capable, headstrong, young (16 year old) protagonist who you care about right from the beginning. Her writing style is fresh, nearly brisk, and she inserts a lot of imaginative ideas about life and inventions in the future. I can't wait to read books 2 and 3. Would love to see this in movie form.

Free is a band you should definitely know about if you're exploring 1970s music and this album is probably the best introduction to the band since it includes live versions of the best tracks from most of their studio albums.<br /><br />Free's guitarist was Paul Kossoff, who died in 1975 (another unfortunate drug related death) but who is still featured fairly regularly in guitar magazines.<br /><br />Free's vocalist was Paul Rodgers, who later went on to front Bad Company and now performs with Queen. He's considered one of the best vocalists in rock.<br /><br />Free's drummer, Simon Kirke, also went on to play in Bad Company with Paul Rodgers.<br /><br />Free deserves a wider audience than it now has. Great band. Great live album. Great guitar work. Great vocals. Highly recommended if you're exploring lesser known 1970s bands.
030746363X|4.0|If one thing is made clear in The 4-Hour Body, it's the value of self-assessment and self-experimentation. The reason this review is later than the 1200 before it is that I was actually doing some of that experimentation. The time has also enabled me to better digest the book than many of the other reviewers.<br /><br />BY A GEEK, FOR GEEKS<br /><br />Tim Ferriss built a loyal audience with his previous book, The 4-Hour Workweek (thus the title of the new book, which really has nothing \\"4-hour\\" about it). Tim is by his own admission someone who loves \\"hacking\\" all aspects of his life--the ultimate geek. Add that to the fact that much of the Western world has become sedentary via the \\"new\\" economy, the appeal to America's tech workers is obvious.<br /><br />In at least its first 300 pages--the ones most likely to be read and/or tried by the average reader--Ferriss sets up each chapter with a best-case scenario or minor celebrity using the \\"hack\\" in question, then outlines a very simple layout of the technique, followed by detail on everything necessary to get the best results. Later chapters devolve into simple tips to do very specific things slightly better, but let's face it, most who read this book want to lose weight, get muscles, have better sex or sleep well.<br /><br />LOSE WEIGHT WHILE EATING BEAR CLAWS?<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body's \\"money\\" chapter is \\"The Slow-Carb Diet.\\" Mr. Ferriss' actual methodology for losing fat--meals consisting solely of protein, vegetables and legumes, with no other carb sources--is sound, because any restrictive diet change will initially help you to lose fat.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this \\"diet\\" is very restrictive. Many of the negative comments here involve some variation on \\"who the eff eats pinto beans with breakfast?\\" Well, if you actually do this program, you will eventually be forced to learn to properly season food.<br /><br />The \\"twist\\" that makes the Slow-Carb Diet unique is binge day, which is much like Fight Club: one day a week, you HAVE to eat to excess. The theory is that by this day-long cheat meal will keep your body's metabolism from slowing down the other six days. Many reviewers \\"reserve judgment\\" on this aspect of the diet. I actually tried it. More on that below.<br /><br />SEX (LIKE A) MACHINE<br /><br />Another talked-about section of the book is \\"The 15-Minute Female Orgasm,\\" which includes a step-by-step process for theoretically giving a woman the orgasm of her life. While the specific stimulation technique may result in a big-time orgasm for her, I'd suggest that if she gets hooked on it, it won't be so much fun for you.<br /><br />But it's highly technical, and has very detailed instructions--again, a big attraction for someone who has little idea of what feels good to a woman. I just can't help thinking this is a poor substitute for learning to use your tongue.<br /><br />BIGGER, STRONGER, FEWER OWIES<br /><br />The crux of the book is \\"the minimum effective dose,\\" which is another way of saying \\"the easiest way.\\" There's a 15-minute lean-mass-building workout, a single-exercise posterior workout, and a super-simple strength-building workout. There are tips for boosting testosterone, sleeping better, learning to swim, and stretching those hips and back that have become stiff after a 14-hour workday hunched over the laptop.<br /><br />Most of these \\"hacks\\" aren't new (although Mr. Ferriss readily admits standing on the shoulder of giants, so to speak), some are contentious (the bodybuilding community seems to have vast expertise with the one system that works for them), but this isn't for the bodybuilding community or someone happy with their Paleo diet. It's for the man or woman who is idly snacking while doing desk work or watching TV, wishes they could be thinner/stronger/better in bed but has failed at more detailed programs.<br /><br />However, even when the setup is simple, there's an element of willpower to anything that will produce real positive change, and some (sometimes many) details necessary to turn that \\"minimum effective dose\\" into the \\"most effective dose.\\"<br /><br />THE MOST VALUABLE TIP IN THE BOOK<br /><br />The idea for this book came from Tim Ferriss' almost fanatical desire to self-experiment: he mentions it at the beginning of the book, and goes into great detail in 80 pages of small print in the appendices. He encourages every reader to do likewise.<br /><br />And that should be the most important thing you get from this book. Humans are not exactly the same. Standing on one leg before bed like Tim does might not help you sleep better, but something else probably will. In order to succeed, you have to first try, then maybe fail, then try something else. That's life.<br /><br />Not everyone has the time or willpower to document their daily activities. Mr. Ferriss understands that, and that's why he also offers quick tips and simple plans, and why the 4-Hour Body has become successful.<br /><br />I TESTED THE BOOK<br /><br />In the spirit of self-experimentation that Mr. Ferriss promotes, I devoted one month to sticking to the 2-page version of The Slow-Carb Diet. No supplements (aside from fish oil, which I take already) or \\"tricks\\" for cheat day. Following this program rigorously, I lost 7 pounds (from 172 to 165), and almost 5 of those 7 pounds were fat. (At 5'11\\", I'm not a huge man with that much fat to spare.)<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, any restrictive dietary change will cause fat loss, for at least the first 4-6 weeks of the diet. Usually I can decrease my fat while building muscle by following my own workout plan and ditching processed foods, so that wasn't the point.  The real reason I tested this program was to see how restrictive, difficult and/or monotonous it would be.<br /><br />Without cooking skills or imagination, this diet WILL be monotonous. Until you start learning to mix spices with the beans, they will become hard to eat at every meal. Breakfast was easy once I discovered I loved spinach omelets. The biggest day-to-day change was the meat source, which kept everything fresh, and I kept lots of salsa and sugar-free marinara on hand.<br /><br />Hanging in for a month was fairly easy for me, and the binge days didn't seem to impede the weight loss (although I worry about this for someone who thinks nothing of eating an entire cake or bucket of KFC at a sitting). I debated carrying on for a second month, but I'm eager to start another chapter. I'll keep you updated.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />If you geek out over \\"body hacks,\\" The 4-Hour Body is for you. If you need structure and simplicity, you can find it here too as long as you don't read too far. If you're already following a successful weight-loss program or workout plan or have bought into the dogma of another guru or community, you're just going to get angry, so don't bother.<br /><br />Approach The 4-Hour Body in the spirit of self-experimentation to get the most out of it. Remember, though, that there's no instant fix, no magic pill--drive and willpower are still required.ose.\\"     THE MOST VALUABLE TIP IN THE BOOK    The idea for this book came from Tim Ferriss' almost fanatical desire to self-experiment: he mentions it at the beginning of the book, and goes into great detail in 80 pages of small print in the appendices.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This political drama/comedy is a rich show full of wit, fast repartee, and brilliantly developed characters. It is also very funny. Internet hype tells us that it was selected as one of the ten smartest TV shows by the president of Mensa a couple of years ago, and I would expect it to appeal to a broad range of smart people far beyond the realms of Mensa membership. It shows us what we should be hoping for with each new election- a country run by smart, educated, dedicated people who are willing to give their all on behalf of their country during their time in office. It also shows us the personal side of how their lives are impacted by the sacrfices that they make to carry out their jobs. I especially appreciated the fact that this show had the time to play out the full range of the plot and character arcs to a mature, well developed conclusion, something sadly missing from too many shows that are terminated early. The result was that even though I was sad to see the show end, I walked away satisfied with the complete story that had been told. I also really liked the fact that they made efforts to find ways to show the opposition party in a sympathetic light rather than always demonizing \\"the other guys.\\" I liked the file-folder system for storage of the discs in this complete set because it made it really easy to keep the current folder up front. Thus I was able to expend my mental energies on following the complexities of the show instead of trying to keep track which disc I had watched most recently. The packaging is beautiful, but if you are pressed for spaced it does not fit neatly in with rows or stacks of standardly-shaped DVD packages.

B003EYVXTG|1.0|Terrible average, boring TV movie of the week sort of film that gets a lot of raves from rich urban critics that never have experienced life outside of a high-rise. The whole movie incorporated scenes that are supposed to be jarring of old cars rusting outside of rural homes and junk, which are to illustrate the shocking poverty of the place. The climax of the movie is very lukewarm at best and you practically waited the entire movie to see what you knew was going to happen.    The rave reviews of this film remind me of the ones \\"Animal Kingdom\\" got. I just don't understand where it is all coming from. I can only conclude that rich people that would call these areas \\"Flyover Country\\" would think movies like this are amazing. To someone like me that has driven all over America, this could be anywhere, any day. The only thing is, real country folk are nothing like the people in this movie. The film's characters are way too sanitized and stereotypical.
B003VANOFY|5.0|OS: Windows(all features), Linux(stereo sound, multimedia-keys, surround not tested)  Pros: Great sound quality, very comfortable, durable, very good microphone noise isolation, great surround sound, good range, and battery life.  Cons: Doesn't have a direct connection to xbox/ps3, but there are ways to use it with consoles, by routing console sound to the computer and outputting it to the headset.    I was skeptical at first when I bought this headset, due to Logitech's reputation of uncomfortable headsets, but when I got the item, it proved the reputation wrong. It is very comfortable to wear, creates amazing sound quality and a great surround sound experience.     **** MP3 ****  I tested the headset while listening to the TRON: Legacy sound tracks - the headset has a great low frequency response, sound was practically identical to the movie theater quality. Actually it was better through the headset, because local movie theater is cheap and doesn't want to upgrade their sound system.    **** Blu-Ray ****  Then I watched a blu-ray movie \\"The A-team\\". Sound was great as usual, couldn't hear much surround at first, but when toggling the \\"surround on/off\\" switch on the headset, could hear some difference. Though I'm pretty sure that's just because surround sound doesn't have much influence in movies. Only seldom I'd head sound from the back, even in the actual movie theater.    **** Gaming ****  I was able to test the surround sound only when I launched game \\"Crysis\\". First person shooter games become so much easier with this headset! I was able to tell almost exact location of the enemies, no matter if they were in front of me, sides, or back. At first I had to get used to such a feedback, because several times I thought someone was actually in the room behind me.    Range and battery life are as good as specified by the specs. Drivers were easy to install. Stereo worked \\"out-of-the-box\\" for my gentoo-linux with alsa build, multimedia keys worked too. Didn't get a chance to test surround though.    The only thing I didn't like as much about the headset is that it is a little squarish, but that is perfect, if you are a \\"Minecraft\\" fan ;D
B000FA5TTW|5.0|On December, 6, 1973 Susie was raped and murdered in an underground room Mr.Harvey built.       She watches her family from heaven see whats going on in their lives.      This is my favorite mystery book ( other than 39 Clues) I wanted to see the movie because when I first saw the preview about it I thought it was scary heh heh I was a wuss back then. Anyway I wacthed the movie and I decided to look it up on my kindle i didnt know they had a book on it. So I tried a sample and I really liked it so on my twelfth birthday I asked my auntie if she could get for me and i just finished it today.       I highly reccomend this book to EVERYBODY!!!!
6305263248|3.0|My initial reaction was that there were simply too many twists in the plot for this film's own good. It was hard to keep up, and in the end you just gave up trying. However, a second viewing with the director's commentary switched on revealed an actually very intelligent and well-acted film. While this extra input should not really have been necessary, it was worth it for this film. If you pay very close attention and/or are have seen lots of examples of the spy/crime genre and are therefore used to the perhaps inevitably twisted story-lines, you may even get it in one! However, even if you do, Frankenheimer's wonderfully intelligent explanation of his work is very highly recommended, and a major treat in itself. (Where would we have been in the days before the DVD special features section?!) So, while a little unbelievable at times, the film itself is generally quite a treat too, with some genuinely great performances (especially De Niro's), highly filmic Parisian and Riviera locations and neat camerawork - not least in relation to the truly outstanding car-chase sequences. The latter really are absolutely breathtaking, and the result of huge effort and dedication by all those involved in their production.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|What a superb listen. Rockabilly to Irish folk and all points between. Imelda not only has the look, but also adorns the sound of an Angel. With Darrel's low thundering Gretsch backing her up it's just hard to go wrong. Her songwriting skills are nothing to laugh about either. Loved every song on the album including the one that Darrel wrote. This CD has been in my player since it arrived.
0812550757|5.0|Tbis book is a little different from \\"Ender's game\\". While it is also very interesting and captivating, it is a little slower and deals more with questions of moral. Very interesting for people who are willing to tolerate a slower pace.

B003K025TQ|5.0|Lee Ritenour assembled a group of fantastic guitarists who provide a wide variety of styles, tones and tunes to make this a cd that is a must have for guitar lovers.  From the elders to the youngers, BB to Joe Robinson; blues, rock and jazz, Joe B. to George B., and too many others to name, this is ear candy.  Throw in some excellent bass from the likes of Tal Wilkenfeld and keyboards from Joey DeFrancesco and you have some phenomenal stuff.
0385341008|5.0|February 28, 2011<br /><br />Dear Friend,<br /><br />I just finished reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and wanted to write and tell you how much I enjoyed the book. I hesitate to use adjectives like \\"charming\\", \\"sweet\\" and \\"lovely\\" because I fear those types of words will give you the wrong impression and turn you away from reading the book, and because the book is so much more than simply charming and lovely.<br /><br />(But the book really is charming, sweet and lovely!)<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society begins shortly after the end of World War 2 when newspaper columnist Juliet Ashton receives a letter from a stranger who is a resident of the Channel Island of Guernsey. Juliet's interest is aroused after reading the letter, and when she learns of the formation and existence of the Guernsey Literary Club during the war, she slowly begins putting together thoughts for her next novel. In her research, Ashton begins a correspondence with other Guernsians and with each new letter friendships build and the story unfolds.<br /><br />The entire story is told through letters written by the various characters, and while I found this slightly difficult to follow at first, my confusion was short lived and I was soon caught up in the many relationships which were being built on nothing more than a shared love of books.<br /><br />Also interesting The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was the historical aspect of the Channel Islands which were occupied by the Nazis during the war. Information on the occupation and how that affected the Guernsians is revealed as the story progresses and while this is oftentimes sad, it only adds to the overall depth and richness of the story.<br /><br />I really can't say enough good things about this book which is a signal to me that I shouldn't try because I'll just sound foolish. All I'll say is that this is the best book I've read in a very long while and one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. The narrative, which is nurtured and developed flawlessly through the letters, is never boring, and there wasn't a page that went by that didn't make me want to either laugh or cry and for me, a generally cynical reader, that's saying a lot. The letter writers in The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society jump off the page and dare you, unsuccessfully in my case, to put the book down. I not only felt drawn to these people, but I wanted to be with these people. There are quotable passages on nearly every page of the book which makes for the delightful prospect of an equally enjoyable second read.<br /><br />There was one plot development toward the end of the book that I didn't quite understand and I questioned why it was even included, but that's my only minor complaint with the book.<br /><br />I thought The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was a pure joy and one I'll keep on my limited shelf space and read again at some point. I can't give this book a high enough recommendation and all I can say without becoming clich&eacute; and saying I didn't want it to end is that The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is special.<br /><br />I hope, dear friend, that one day we're all able to open up our souls and bond with other people and allow our lives to be changed through nothing more than a shared appreciation of books. How wonderful would that be?<br /><br />\\"I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\\" - Juliet Ashton.<br /><br />I hope you allow The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society to find its way to you.<br /><br />Warm regards,<br />Michaeld and developed flawlessly through the letters, is never boring, and there wasn't a page that went by that didn't make me want to either laugh or cry and for me, a generally cynical reader, that's saying a lot.

B004HW7JMY|5.0|I think we all approached this prequel, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, with great trepidation after watching Blood and Sand. I can tell you GOTA does not disappoint. Episode 1 blasts out of the starting gate with over-the-top action and does not let up until the end credits of episode 6. The mini series answers many questions posed in B&S: What happened to Doctore's wife; how did Battiatus and Solonius come to be at odds with one another; what happened between Crixus and Ashur resulting in Ashur's injury; how did Crixis become Champion of Capua and Lucretia's lover? These questions (and others) are all answered while the writers continue to ramp up the intrigue, action and sex. Outstanding performances by Lawless, Hannah, Murray and Tarabay.<br /><br />Buy this. You won't be disappointed.
B002OT7314|4.0|Got to say, I disagree with another  reviewer that said this  album was stale. Every song is good and it pin points a time in the Stones career that was sort of their come back. Steel Wheels was the 1st studio album in 3 yrs and they were in top form playing great live versions of Ruby Tuesday and Sympathy For The Devil, along with cuts from Steel Wheels. Back when the album came out it was 12.00  for the record or $20.00 for the cd so this price is not bad considering its 100% remasterd. Start me up opens the album and<br />Satisfaction ends the live portion. Then as the other reviewer stated, Highwire and Sex Drive are the two studio cuts. Great time piece and a darn good underated live album. If you don't have it, get it!

0756405890|4.0|I almost think some of the negative commentary I have seen about this book is just typical need to be different.  So many fantasy readers like to knock the top titles just to sound superior.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It held up to the hype and surprised me with the voice.  I really liked the pacing of it, too.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the sequel. My one criticism would be that it was expensive for Kindle and moreso with the hardcover release.
B0045U9WPU|1.0|*******SPOILER ALERT*******<br /><br />I don't know if I missed it in the book description, but I never expected the main character to be so indecisive.  She had more than one opportunity to escape and actually did once, only to come right back in for what I considered to be no good reason.  It is pointed out repeatedly, and then some more, that if anyone gets caught trying to escape they will be put to death... Then, the main character and her love interest are chased, while trying to escape, and he is captured. Boom! End of book.  I read a lot of books, sometimes up to five a week, and I can't think of a book I've read in the past five years that I have disliked more than this one.  What a waste of my time and money.

And IF YOU WANT IT sounds exactly like Adam Ant circa Wonderful.     Then there's NEW HOLY GROUND that sounds like a Pink Floyd - The Wall reject. And the embarassing SAVE ME sounds like it was stolen out of a Studebakers nightclub!    And everything between is exactly what OMD is: In the dark!!!    I'm shocked that people actually gave this thing good reviews!!! There's nothing here! There's no edginess whatsoever! There's nothing new! There's no keyboard hooks (or bass for that matter)!

1439152780|5.0|\\"A life, Miss Burchill, a human life, is bracketed by a pair of events: one's birth and one's death.  The dates of those events belong to a person as much as their name, as much as the experiences that happen in between.\\"  This statement, one directed at the book's protagonist during a prolonged and earth-shattering confession, may as well be a central point of description in a plot summary for \\"The Distant Hours\\", the third and most intricately layered novel yet from Australian author Kate Morton.  It is literary fiction and mystery together, the formation and arrangement of the story's building blocks and lead-ins to the numerous secrecies within its pages painstaking and incredibly rewarding.<br /><br />Edith Burchill loves books; hers is a long and somewhat guilty affair that began with her confiscation of the local library's copy of \\"The True History of the Mud Man\\", a macabre tale penned by famed author Raymond Blythe.  Blythe once inhabited the resplendent Milderhurst Castle, a grand property now suffering from neglect, unpleasant memories, and the curious and intensely private natures of his three elderly daughters (Persephone aka Percy, Seraphina aka Saffy, Juniper).  Edith's occupation with a small publishing house and obsession with the Mud Man and Milderhurst expands when her mother Meredith, a transitory resident of the castle during WWII, receives a letter that opens many old and creaking doors, their squeaks and groans the songs of confession of which Meredith speaks (\\"Ancient walls that sing the distant hours\\").  Of particular interest to Edith is her mother's former friendship with Juniper, a woman rumored to have gone mad after her fianc&eacute;e failed to show for dinner one fateful stormy evening.  Contracted to write a piece on the Blythe family, Edith visits the castle and has an encounter with Juniper that shakes her to the core; when seeking answers as to the reasons behind Juniper's psychosis, she is rebuffed time and again by the unyielding Percy.  She experiences much of the same when asking her mother about Milderhurst, the strong intent on everyone's part to keep their secrets about the place only encouraging Edith to dig ever deeper for the truth.  What she finds out will be the light upon the myriad shadows surrounding the Blythe family, including the dark and tragic inspiration behind the tale she so loves.<br /><br />Morton is an absolutely exceptional author, her stories rich with complicated and fascinating characters, places full of intrigue and tragedy, and resonating with powerful themes.  There is many a veil of secrecy in \\"The Distant Hours\\", each with its fine fabric of lies and concealment expertly and tightly woven by its makers.  There is jealousy, rage, and infidelity, all of which bear seed in the Mud Man's morbid conception.  There are the intangible and indivisible ties of family, bonds so strong they threaten to break yet mend themselves time and again through unconditional love.  There is romantic love and the heartache that comes in tandem.  There is madness, death and the ineradicable annals of one's own personal history.  Though there is no possibility for one character's reparation in wrongdoing, there is still relief and forgiveness to be had in confession, that things have been set right at long last, giving the reader a sense of closure.  Morton keeps this all together with a story that ebbs and flows, her build-ups sometimes a small torment but always keeping the reader on the edge, hungry for discovery and swooning over her concise, sincere and reflective delivery.<br /><br />I have give to credit for a fascinating story within a story here: after reading the \\"excerpt\\" from The True History of the Mud Man that is used as the opening, I found myself every bit as entranced as Edith by the story; I felt as though it were an actual existing book, what with all the compelling history Morton attaches to it, and it made me wish that it was real so that I could read it in itsentirety.  She says this of its inception: \\"The portion of Raymond's Blythe's rather spooky story came to me in a flash, on a cold, wet winter's evening. I was alone in a cabin in the forest, mist had rolled up the mountain, and I was sitting by the window watching night fall. All of a sudden I was struck by an image of a young girl perched upon a bookcase at the top of a castle tower. She was looking over a dark landscape, dreaming about her future, when down below her, deep in the muddy moat, something began to stir.  I raced to my computer and wrote the prologue in a single sitting. All the other pieces of the puzzle slotted into place once I found my Mud Man.\\" Color me a deep and brilliant shade of intrigued.  Perhaps at some point she will consider penning this story in its entirety as a nice side project for her most devoted fans.<br /><br /> Bottom line: A captivating read from beginning to end, \\"The Distant Hours\\" will sing of your time spent reading it with each page turned in eagerness, its swan dive into the idea of \\"if these walls could talk\\" having the most curious of our lot wondering freely on the spirits that whisper their secrets within each ancient edifice, and whether or not they can be heard if we listen hard enough.s inception: \\"The portion of Raymond's Blythe's rather spooky story came to me in a flash, on a cold, wet winter's evening.

0670022411|4.0|A fast-paced, highly engaging read from start to finish I loved this book! Harkness never faultered, and I was never once disppointed by the (many) turns the narrative took. That is, until the end.... It snuck up on me so abruptly that I had to flip back a couple pages to make sure I didn't miss something. I hope there's a sequel in the works, otherwise it gets 1 star: it was simply too-good a book to end so suddenly with so many questions left unanswered! It left me wanting to know what happens next, and here's hoping she doesn't disappoint!

While because of a disfunctional family life, I never was particularily close to him. I just happened upon and read this book a year before his stroke. While relatives had no idea how to respond (often yelling and getting mad at his wrong responses) I was able to connect.    All the while I knew he was dieing but I was just an observer. A much wiser observer but, I never cried for him.

If you sit back and enjoy the deadpan humor and take it for what it is: A well thought out, highly intelligent, well acted 60 minutes, then you have not wasted your time.  Kudos to Fringe for moving into the area where many could not.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|After very little total use I am looking for my third pair of pads in three years at a cost of $25 a set ($75 and counting). My old Sennheiser headphones/pads (that I still have) lasted 25 years! I only use them for watching Blu-Ray movies when the wife is asleep. They stay in a cabinet in a velvet bag. Pads started flaking off... I will (god only knows) maybe have to buy 10 more pairs in the future? Rrrrr... notice on Amazon replacement pads are bought really OFTEN... crazy.  Sony products are beautiful, but have a two year life span due to poor durability. If you are a fan of Sony products then fine, I was too. But two close friends who bought these on my recommendation have had the exact problem. Both also walked around work with black specks stuck to their faces not knowing what the source was...<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Please read the review of this Sony products' earcups at the following competitors' earcup replacements have been used by a dozen other owners (a suitable replacement there) at Beyerdynamic EDT 200 ear cushions. They state the problem better then I can... these Sony cups will disintegrate within a year's time (or two etc.). I bought a set of those new velour ones and am VERY happy almost two years now. Thanks folks for the kind update (those of you have expressed discontent at other forum members bringing up a valid and established issue are way off base! ... please just let the 'easy fix' be published instead of comment on your 'feelings' on hundred dollar headphones needing almost immediate replacement)  ... take care all you wonderful other Amazon update people who have helped and assisted with this issue!<br /><br />UPDATE June/2014 ... The left channel went out on these earphones long ago, binned. I have since purchased Grado, have not looked back once. I have disabled ALL Amazon alerts, so to those of you sane persons... best of luck with your purchase. To any of those who would state that their feelings about a product are superior to others, my wife says: these men were abused as children, are still children, have never truly experienced love... we should pray for them... and be thankful someone else has to wipe up all the venomous spittle. *whew*
B00000AFWZ|5.0|For my money, disc 2 is the strongest of the four.  End to end, every single track is a masterpiece of loud hard groove.  And let me repeat that word: \\"LOUD!\\"  You know how a lot of albums will say \\"play this loud\\" or somesuch in the notes?  Well, this album may not explicitly say this, and I would guess that it would not occur to a lot of people based upon what their expectations of what \\"golden oldies\\" from the 60's should sound like, but just about every song here was remastered with the bass mixed way up so that it will rock your every internal organ if you play it on a car stereo with sufficient power in the trunk.  Seriously, if you play this really really loud you will hear far more in every song than you otherwise might.    Here's my tip for calibration: Disc 2 Track 28 is \\"Strychnine\\" by the Sonics.  (If you're not familiar with them, you ought to get this collection just for their three songs-- Gerry Roslie has one of the coolest voices in rock'n'roll history.)  Turn the volume up to just short of where the screaming starts to physically hurt your ears.  I defy you to listen to this a half a dozen times with some alcohol or misc. chemicals in your system and not sing along.  If you have rock in your heart, you will sing, I'm telling you.  And if you can hear your own singing, you need to turn the volume up just a bit more.  Then turn it down one or two clicks, which is loud enough for everything else on the disc.  At that volume, \\"power pop\\" becomes something very much other than pure confection.  Example: try the Human Beinz' \\"Nobody But Me\\" at normal car radio volume then turn it up as per the recipe above.  How different a song is that now?  Hasn't the entire rationale for what it is and how it's played somehow fundamentally changed?  And this is true of almost all the poppier songs here; hell, even the Turtles really rock at volume.  And did you know Paul Revere was this tough?    And the harder songs absolutely MUST be played at volume otherwise what's the point? (I was a kid in the day and you know, I don't remember any of it being quite this rough-- although I guess looking back at it maybe it's because people didn't have the kind of equipment that could do this stuff justice?) Kenny and the Kasuals, the Sparkles... a good rule of thumb is that any song where the vocalist ends up screaming should be turned up to where it's the volume of a real live human scream.  Seriously, the snotnose youngsters of today have NO IDEA what a brutal beating the stuff grandpa listened to could lay on their tender young millennial asses.    Try it.  You'll feel strengthened and enlivened and it may even bring joy to an otherwise-suicidal morning commute.  And if you have to put some more power in the trunk to do it up right, well it was time to upgrade anyway, wasn't it?  You love rock'n'roll, don't you?  Don't you?  Buy this album.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|My 10 year old Grandson is obsessed with Dr. Who. I purchased this DVD set for him for Christmas. Recently while chatting with his Mom online, she mentioend he was standing right there. I asked her to tell him I loved him. He replied \\"I know, she loves me a lot! She bought me my Dr. Who dvd's!\\" What more can I say? If you are a fan, you will be happy and you can't beat the price!
B000M9BPEY|5.0|This film offers so much, it's difficult to know where to begin. I grew up watching Burton's films, with \\"Frankenweenie\\", and soon after the first \\"Pee Wee Herman\\" film. As much as I love Tim Burton's films, the one that stands alone is \\"Big Fish\\". To me, this is his best work...his \\"Citizen Kane\\". It's the unltimate feel-good film, the ultimate fairy tale. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but I believe the central point of the film is to repair a broken relationship between a father & son, played to precision by Albert Finney & Billy Crudup. Much of Finney's life is shown in flashbacks, where he is portrayed by Ewan MacGregor (who in turn was a fine choice of casting!). Scenes of extraordinary characters & storytelling is what makes the film so wonderful. Through all of it's craziness, the main theme I believe is love. Finney's wife is played by Jessica Lange, who is fantastic as well. The supporting cast helps make the film so powerful too, with a big highlight going out to Danny DeVito, who as usual, gives a strong performance.    All in all, do not miss this film. This will alaways be on my top five favorite films, and will make you laugh & move you.

B00004WPAE|5.0|I've been a 'collector' of music since 1973. I've gone through all the format changes and have embraced them with  their warts and all. So now, in February of 2011 I've gone over the edge and bought a Music Hall MMF 2.2 LE turntable, And this piece of vinyl.......I put it on the tt and I just about lost it! Yellow Vinyl, Quiet pressing and oh, oh, OH the music that  came out of the speakers is BEYOND WORDS....... This thing sounds so LUSCIOUS THAT I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU. I know that they 'remixed' the songs for this album, But I will say, IF THERE IS ANY VINYL ALBUM YOU CAN BUY OF THE BEATLES THEN YOU NEED TO BUY THIS AND LISTEN!!!!!!!!! It IS that good. Not ONE pop or click and even my wife said....That Sounds REALLY good.  So kudo's to emi and whomever put/engineered this slab o' vinyl........worth 5 times the price!!!  Gerard Masters
0439023521|5.0|I actually love this book. I think it's well-written and poses like-able characters. I do think the book is plot-driven, but that is a necessity as part of the games. You see Katniss' consideration and daring from the beginning. I also like how romance is a necessity in the book. It's not a common theme, like in any plain YA romance, but it's a key plot device.  I find the way Haymitch, District 12's drunk mentor, is portrayed is interesting and humorous. He's condescending, genius, drunk, and sober all at the same time.  As for as characters go, I like certain side characters. Gale, Rue and even Haymitch. The way Katniss constantly  compares Peeta to Gale could be irritating, by Suzanne Collins balances it out perfectly.  The book has some basic themes: loyalty, friendship, love, family, faith. I definitely recommend it, and I look forward to book three, Mockingjay. (Book two is Catching Fire.) I hope I don't keel up and die from impatience as I await August 24th. This trilogy is definitely on my wish list!    8*
B004HD2ZK4|4.0|Tao of the Dead really is the most ambitious thing that the band have done to date. As a creative work that exists across multiple mediums, I'll judge this accordingly.<br /><br />First off, this album was compared to Yes' \\"Close to the Edge\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" pretty early on. I don't think it's on the level of those albums, either from a musical, lyrical, or artistic standpoint. It IS still a very good album, though, with plenty of interesting segments and plenty of pay-off for people who give it multiple listens.<br /><br />As a concept record, though, it seems to fall short. The comic and the album spiral around each other, sometimes intertwining and sometimes completely unrelated. Sometimes, the lyrics seem to have nothing to do with the comic included at all; other times, they seem at best to borrow imagery of the comic for purposes unrelated to actual story telling.<br /><br />And that's what this project seems to be: a puzzle of sorts, or a prequel of things never to come.  Without the comic book and art direction forming the backbone of this work, the other contents by themselves probably would not be very good. Yet the 'backbone' that the comic book actually provides seems to be more of a semi-cohesive gel; it sticks everything together somehow, but it's unable to support what the album is as it tries to lift itself up past those classic albums it admittedly aspires to.<br /><br />More narrative here, an actual tie-in with the comic and story-telling through music rather than a themed 'cosplay parade' of its future contents would have been better. Still, I love this addictive album for what it is: a failure, but a beautiful one. Like another album, Yes' \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans,\\" this album collapses under its own ambition before making it off the flight-deck.
0439023513|5.0|When it comes to books that are household names-Harry Potter for instance-I can't get fully obsessed with it. Twilight never stuck with me. Harry Potter I love, but I'm not obsessed with it. Then there's the Hunger Games. I loved these books, even though I only started a few months before Mockingjay released. But until recently, I didn't even know HG was so popular. It wasn't that amazing to me.  Onto my review. The beginning was kinda slow, but still very intense, with Collins' writing. She's absolutely brilliant. Then it picked up even more, and was brilliant. I felt it was reaching a point of such intensity....and then something happening, crushing me. I'm also among the people who disliked the ending. It was a bitter-sweet HEA, but still too perfect for Katniss's miserable life.  Something happened to Peeta in the Capitol and I love Peeta but...it was so cool, from a reader's POV.  I love Katniss, always. And then there's the boys. I've never been a fan of love triangles, and this was predicable. One boy was my favorite, but the way everything was written, I knew she would pick the other boy. Predictable. And she did.  Some stuff was just messed up. Near the ending, she takes a stand and does something completely...insane. What the HECK? Why did she listen to that person?

0545123283|5.0|I was a little tentative to start Linger because of the multiple points of view. As you know, instead of Shiver's two characters-Grace and Sam-we have four; the original two along with Isabel and Cole.<br /><br />I felt like the plot buildup was a little slow. It started out awesome; I had high expectations. Then something happened that made me really excited, but then it died down again very quickly. The main problem was something wrong with Grace, and I felt like this problem wasn't emphasized as much as it should be. This could be done on-purpose, but I felt like I was ignoring it, just to find out it was the main problem.<br />Instead, I found myself focusing on Sam and his problem with Cole, which didn't turn out the way I expected it to. Look to the right for a line graph I made on the buildup.<br />On to Cole. He surprised me. He started off as this obnoxious kid, doing idiotic things and being an overall jerk. But...he was really intelligent. The intelligence doesn't seem to fit with the image I have of him; and I don't like it. It's fun to watch him not be a jerk though, like with Isabel...<br />Which brings me to the romance. In Shiver, Sam wanted to stay human so he could be with Grace; the romance was a key part of the book. In Linger, I felt like the romance wasn't emphasized like it was supposed to be. There was no \\"I love you\\" and only a bit of \\"I miss you\\" when Grace and Sam weren't together. There was also very little kissing between the two. This brings us to the Cole-Isabel relationship. I was led to believe that there was something there but...there wasn't.<br />One of my favorite parts of the book was when Cole showed some of his genius and came up with a theory about the werewolves. It put a whole twist on the generic idea of why werewolves (or at least these werewolves) are the way they are.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this part.<br />Overall, I think Shiver was better, but I enjoyed Linger too. I loved the ending, and now I'm dying for Forever. You may have heard \\"I now have to wait forever for Forever\\" so I'm going to spare you the cheesy lines. It was good. I look forward to Forever. I'm the type that when I finish a good book, I'm excited for the next because I liked it. But after a while, that initial desire fades a bit and my thoughts change to \\"I'm excited because I know I liked it.\\" I know that I know that I want it.  After reading Shiver, I felt this way about Linger; the initial desire is slowly fading as I await book 3. I hope you enjoyed the review, and weren't annoyed by the length.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING: ****/ 4 and a half stars, but because I'm prejudice nice, I'll give it 5.<br /><br />A little added bit:<br />In Shiver, I was hoping that Sam would go visit his parents in jail. He didn't. When I received Linger, I was looking forward to possibly meeting his parents. He didn't go to them, which left me with a feeling of disappointment. I doubt any of you are like this, but I was looking forward to meeting Mr. and Mrs. Roth. I sincerely hope that Maggie Stiefvater brings them into the picture in the final book.<br />One thing that irritated me immensely was Maggie's overuse of a certain character trait and plot developer.<br />Isabel and Cole had many heartfelt discussions. Every time, the character whose point of view it is does something like, \\"I wondered why I was telling him/her everything. It was because I knew s/he wouldn't care.\\"<br />Every time they spoke, whoever was telling had the same thought: I'm doing it because Cole/Isabel doesn't care anyways, and won't feel bad for me.<br />Once or twice this is fine, but it got increasingly annoying as the book progressed.ow have to wait forever for Forever\\" so I'm going to spare you the cheesy lines.

B002ZG9940|1.0|From the trailer and back of the DVD, I had been looking forward to this one.  Wish I had watched something else with my time.  Probably one of the most mislabeled \\"suspense thrillers\\" I have ever seen.  Fairly predictable and very boring.  No suspense, the nudity didn't move the film along and you never got to know or like the main character.  Avoid it in my book.
B004E3XD1W|5.0|There have been many great reviews for this book, and they're well-deserved. I may have mentioned this before, but often fantasy is plot- not character-driven. Here, much of what happens is Katsa and Po's own doing.  Katsa is a independent, fearsome and capable. Graceling is one of the rare reads that is slightly feminist. Meaning, when it comes to Katsa versus Po, she can beat him easily. Usually, the girl has to depend on the guy to help her, but not here.  You can see how Katsa and Po's relationship grows. That part is interesting.  It was kind of obvious, but it came about in an interesting way. The way Po braves it and admits he loves her is just....intense. I'd say more on this topic, but that would be spoilery, so I'll just say that he knows that she feels the same.  Even before they officially fall in love, he's so protective over her, even when she is more capable than him. They're perfect together :) Her refusal to marry is just an interesting tidbit thrown in.  There are twists and turns along the way, and many problems the two have to face. Those are plot-driven, but the duo take care of them well. Many books have predictable endings. But Graceling had a perfect ending. My only complaint is that I didn't want it to end.  Overall, I loved it.  ********** 10 stars. WHY AREN'T YOU READING THIS RIGHT NOW!?!?!?

0385528752|5.0|Just read Chip and Dan Heath's book Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard. After reading it, if are leading change of any kind or will at any time in the future, you need to read this book.<br /><br />The Heath brothers look at the idea of an elephant and a rider to show how change happens, how it is reacted to and why it is reacted to that way. The rider represents our analytical side or analytical people. They are interested in data, the why behind change and how it will play out, the plan. The elephant is the emotional side, the feelings, the impulsiveness to a change. The elephant asks, \\"How will this change affect me?\\"<br /><br />What they pointed out that was really interesting was the idea that people often react to change and the problem is not a people problem but a situation problem, an environment problem. What they showed through a variety of studies and examples is that often to make change happen, you need to change the environment that  people reside in.<br /><br />One of the leadership principles that often gets overlooked that they talked about was looking for bright spots. Often leaders, especially in churches, we look for what is not working and try to change that, and that is the focus of our change. What if instead, we looked for what is working, the bright spots and look at how to replicate that. As the Heath brothers said, \\"Anytime you have a bright spot, your mission is to clone it.\\"<br /><br />In the midst of change, uncertainty will arise at some point. In those moments, that is when the people in your church or organization will retreat to what they know. That is why clarity is so important. That is why you need to appeal to the head (the rider) and the heart (the elephant) to keep them on track, to keep them on the path as the writers point out.<br /><br />What was probably the most helpful was the idea of scripting moves. When making a change, changing a culture, adding something to a church, tell people what is expected, what will the new world look like once the change is complete. The authors pointed out, \\"The details is where people get hung up and fall off track.\\" Ambiguity is the enemy of change. Or the flip side, \\"Clarity dissolves resistance.\\" Describe for people what your church will be like when the change is complete. Paint a picture. Tell them how you will get there, what it will feel like on the way. Sometimes, prepare them for failure or what will seem like failure. Often, change efforts use the sequence of analyze-think-change, which rarely works. Instead, use see-feel-change.<br /><br />Often what trips up leaders in making changes is the herd, the crowd. If you get the crowd, you win the change because people follow the crowd, as behavior is contagious. The authors point out \\"We imitate the behaviors of others, whether consciously or not.\\"<br /><br />Here are a few other things that jumped out:<br /><br />-For anything to change, someone has to start acting differently.<br />-What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity.<br />-If you want people to change, you must provide crystal clear direction.<br />-The core of the matter is always about changing the behavior of people, and behavior change happens in highly successful situations mostly by speaking to people's feelings.<br />-To keep the elephant motivated, people must get a sense of progress. Without progress, people will get demoralized.<br />-The rider needs direction, the elephant needs motivation.<br /><br />As I said, this is a book definitely worth picking up. I was able to read it on the plane the other day, so a fast read with a ton of nuggets in it.<br /><br />For more book reviews, go to [...].e change is complete.

1936594390|5.0|What would a portrait of your soul look like?<br /><br />More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.<br /><br />For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.<br /><br />As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty.  But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.<br /><br />While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse.  Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.<br /><br />In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.<br /><br />As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book.  Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.<br /><br />It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.<br /><br />Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book.  Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy.

B003UESJF6|5.0|And there came a day when Lex Luthor finally slew Superman, when Doctor Doom outwitted Reed Richards, when the World bested Scott Pilgrim, when Elmer Fudd finally bagged Bugs Bunny. It's rare that a super-villain achieves his end goal, and so you can't blame Megamind for being out of sorts when ultimate triumph finally came his way. I thought DESPICABLE ME was really terrific, and then the similarly-themed MEGAMIND came along and I enjoyed it even better than DESPICABLE ME.<br /><br />I've never liked Will Ferrell better. The cast is across-the-board fine, but Ferrell had to carry the load, and he hits all the right notes as Megamind, playing up the megalomaniacal side while retaining enough wounded vulnerability that you can't help but root for the bad guy. The movie sets out to make Megamind sympathetic from jump, opening with a passage which chronicles baby Megamind's rocky rocket ship flight from his doomed native planet to Earth. The little guy is established as a hard luck character, thanks to his early thunder getting stolen by another infant - destined to grow up as the superhero Metro Man - also fleeing a dying world. It's this second, aesthetically more pleasing baby who settles under the Christmas tree in a posh mansion and a silver spoon upbringing. Little Megamind's rocket ship, knocked off course by the other baby's ship, careens straight into a maximum security prison, where the baby grows up mentored by hardened convicts. It's that old Nature versus Nurture conundrum again, only played out in tights. Growing up blue-skinned, bulbous-noggined, friendless except for his fish sidekick, and in school always picked last for everything, an embittered boy determines to be villainous.<br /><br />Which is cool, since the villain of the piece is almost always more interesting. Metro City's champion, Metro Man, is adored by the citizens, glorified even by the local television reporter, Roxanne Ritchi: \\"His heart is an ocean inside a bigger ocean,\\" she gushes. But dude's a bore. Megamind's greatest asset, we eventually learn, is his tenacity. Year after year his flamboyant criminal acts are confounded by Metro Man. But there's no quit in Megamind. And then, one day, shockingly, Megamind finally comes out on top. Not even he expected that.<br /><br />The film looks fantastic with its bright colors and impeccable animation. It's almost a shame that we've gotten used to animation graphics being this stellar nowadays, because it does take away from this film's visual accomplishments. But, with that being a given, it all comes down to the story content, like it always should. MEGAMIND offers snappy one-liners and many wonderful visual gags, and I grin whenever Megamind mispronounces Metro City (to something that rhymes with \\"monstrosity\\") and also when Titan spells his name as \\"Tighten.\\" But there's also a core narrative which is textured and laced with a richness and nice bits of character development, with the most thought provoking element centering around a villain's melancholy. Megamind finds that holding dominion over Metro City isn't as gratifying when no hero comes to save the day. Long moments of agonizing produce a solution, and so Megamind quickly puts his plan into motion. He'll invent a superhero to challenge him again, create his very own playmate. Good thing Metro Man has dandruff.<br /><br />It's a neat topsy-turvying of superhero conventions, and I don't think anyone will miss out on all the references, from the awesome nod to Marlon Brando's Jor-El to the sassy news reporter (and token damsel in distress) Roxanne Ritchi, obviously a Lois Lane clone. Tina Fey makes her come alive, and Roxanne actually provides the story's grounding element. Her strange relationship with Megamind figures in many of the film's emotionally satisfying moments. Meanwhile, her creepy cameraman also pines for Roxanne, except that she wants no truck with him. That last sentence, by the way, drips with foreshadowing.<br /><br />MEGAMINDisn't quite as top shelf as THE INCREDIBLES or as evocative as TOY STORY or WALL-E, but it's marvelous enough with its heart and pathos and non-stop laughs. Even more than Gru, I rooted like mad for this underdog to win out, to beat his adversary, to get the girl, to find acceptance. \\"I did my best. But he was too fantastic!\\" wails Megamind in an early scene. I wasn't looking for that in the climax.<br /><br />This single DVD's bonus material: the filmmakers' audio commentary; \\"Meet the Cast of MEGAMIND\\" (00:09:22 minutes long); the deleted toothbrush scene (00:01:34 minutes), and the \\"World of DreamWorks Animation\\" which showcases song excerpts and selected video game and DVD promos for the KUNG FU PANDA, MADAGASCAR, and SHREK franchises, and for HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.isn't quite as top shelf as THE INCREDIBLES or as evocative as TOY STORY or WALL-E, but it's marvelous enough with its heart and pathos and non-stop laughs.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|I'll start off by saying I've seen a fair amount of Aranofsky's work and enjoyed Pi and Requiem for a Dream a lot. I saw the trailer for this ages ago, and thought it looked creepy enough (like the two mentioned above) that I'd check it out, despite revolving around a subject which I could care less about. To my surprise, it had me hooked from the beginning. Natalie Portman is incredible -- she definitely deserved best actress for her role which came across as genuine as an I've seen in years. As with any of the Best Picture nominees you'll see a ton of sock puppets and trolls either praising it or blasting it, and as usual you'll have to figure it out for yourself. I'm neither, just an instant fan of this flick that thinks it deserves most of the praise heaped on it.

And why when Evolutionists talk about the fossils being buried why is it always due to a sudden flood, or water coming? Seems to be a flood to me.<br /><br />Now Scientific fields of study established by Creationists.<br />Joseph Lister - Antiseptic surgery<br />Louis Pasteur - Bacteriology<br />Isaac Newton - Calculus<br />Johannes Kepler - Celestial Mechanics<br />Robert Boyle - Chemistry<br />Georges Cuvier - Comparative Anatomy<br />John Woodward - Paleontology<br /><br />Evolution is just the attempt the free man from God and his responsibility to his Creator.<br />The geologic column appears nowhere in the world except in 25 places. ONLY 25. The Swiss Alps are backwards we have at the top Permian fossils (apparently 500 million years old. The middle layer Jurassic fossils (apparently 300 million years old) Than the last layer Tertiary fossils (apparently 100 million years old. If evolution and the column is true we should find geologic column layers (in order) everywhere. Where are they?
B00139XZF4|5.0|When you read a book, your imagination displayed a vision in the eyes of your mind. Evolutionary technological creativity, via Computer Science today, to some degree, has taken our imagination, to a factual visual display. We now see what the Big Bad Wolf looks like. This movie is only a step/leap forward to old/young viewers, as to what the now/future holds for them. Very simply, here is a Very Entertaining Movie, that also delivers a Moral Message of Good over Evil. As an Old Coot, I thoroughly enjoyed it very much.

B001KEHAI0|5.0|An American Classic. Bill Murray, as usual gives us his best performances in impossible to believe situations. The beautiful Andie McDowell, only needs to smile as Murrays side kick, but her performance, makes this offering believable and real. Unfortunately, movies of this type have given way to Creepy, Crawling, Zombie, Metamorphic Creatures that blow you out of your seat and deafen you. Relaxing, engrossing attention getting entertainment like this Movie, are rare, so relish this one.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I loved star wars growing up. I spent alot of money as a kid to get all the cool toys. And like many my age was less than impressed when i saw episodes 1 2 & 3. Is there such a thing as dictatorship in the film industry... Or even an EVIL EMPIRE?  Well if there is one, and anyone reading this can slightly agree. How come he staggers release dates, only remasters new version without updating the orignal with cleaned up video and sound? Pioneering the THX standard, however makes us watch the modified version he wants us too. Well I lost interest, who the f cares anymore George! Are you happy you made Han solo to be a good guy instead of the misguided hero we came to love. George or I should say DARTH LUCAS reread the hero's journey. This late release date reminds me of the disney marketing. George Lucas you killed star wars with your greed... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

159102594X|2.0|I read \\"The Blade Itself\\" and \\"Before They are Hanged\\" based on numerous recommendations I had received. I was disappointed.    Most of the people who recommend this series say that it's \\"original\\" and \\"character-driven.\\" I can't say that I feel the same; often, I felt that Abercrombie was using the plot of a well-known fantasy (or science fiction) novel while adding some pseudo-psychological inner monologue to make his characters seem more \\"gritty.\\" Logen Ninefingers is a perfect example: he is a typical berserker (with typical \\"battle rages\\") who is merely given an introspective inner monologue to make this seem more significant than it is.  His actions remain the same as they would otherwise be. We have the spoiled nobleman, the hon'rable military man, Gandalf + Machiavelli, and so on. Even Glokta reminded me of Severian from the (far superior) Book of the New Sun ([[ASIN:0312890176 Shadow & Claw: The First Half of 'The Book of the New Sun' (Book of the Long Sun)]]), although Glokta's is easily the most successful story arc.    All of that said, I liked \\"The Blade Itself\\" before I read its sequel, because it felt like an introduction to something that might be interesting.  Unfortunately, it didn't use its promising start as a jumping off point -- it just kept hitting the same note, as if Abercrombie had used an outline of a typical fantasy plot and just added more gore, more sex, more Self-Hating Inner Monologue to make it MORE EXTREME!

B003CR9BYE|5.0|Simply amazing.<br />-<br />I'm a huge fan of Frank's.  Yah, we're on a first-name basis, He and I.<br />-<br />This album is like butter.  Frank said of this album, that he \\"hadn't sung so softly since the time he lost his voice\\".  And it shows - it's just glorious.<br />Frank heard some Samba tunes before he made this, and he was hooked.  He wanted to sort of introduce that vibe to the American public, and so he recorded with Jobim.<br />-<br />Now, I won't go into detail here about this disc: It's actually 2 albums (or 1 and 3/4 albums, if you want to get technical), but it's just pure awesomeness.  Also - Frank hits his lowest recorded note ever during a song on this CD.  I could tell you what it is, but really you need to but this and hear it for yourself.  Man, it's just a smooooooth album.  I love it.
1439153663|2.0|In a more skillful writer's hands, the story of a white girl who becomes an indentured servant on a plantation and is raised by slaves could have been wonderful.  Unfortunately, this book is not.  I will say that it's a page turner; you do want to see what's going to happen next with the characters.  I kept thinking that it's the sort of book I would have really enjoyed if I were, say, 12 years old.  It would have let me understand some of what went on during that time, and how some adults are horrid and some are wonderful, etc.  But I'm in my 40's and I already know all that.  I need more.  This novel does NOT qualify as \\"literary fiction,\\" a term which signifies stellar writing.  As young adult fiction, it is ok.  But even in that context I would hedge my recommendation - the protagonist, Lavinia, does not come across as a strong female character and would not be a good role model for young women.  The author, in the \\"interview\\" at the end of the book, implies that she was channeling the spirits of actual people when she wrote this book, and that thus the characters could only do what they wanted to do.  She was essentially powerless.  OK, whatever -- the editor of the book was not powerless and should have pared down the extraneous characters and story lines and made Lavinia a stronger woman.
0060922583|3.0|Firstly, I want to say that when anybody tries to find a \\"scientific validity\\" for paranormal phenomena, things are gonig to fall flat on their face... Starting out with this idea of a holographic universe, and then trying to apply that idea to all the events in the book is basically an exercise of a solution trying to find a problem... It doesn't work very well on that level...     However, what made this book interesting for me is that it's a unique collection of stories about paranormal phenomena, either experienced by the author or re-told by the author from other sources...  Since the author wasn't there to experience or witness a lot of them, it's kind of being told, this happened sometime, somewhere..  So, if that event interested me, I could research it further... So, on that level the book worked for me... And yes, be aware that some of the stories are going to be a little outlandish... :)

B001AR0D4A|5.0|I would put this movie up in the top ten King adaptations, maybe even top five. The original story is quite probably one of Stephen King's best shorts, a tale that has been a long time in coming to the silver screen revolving around a cross section of small town folk, along with a couple of \\"out of towners\\", trapped in a supermarket when a mysterious mist rolls in after some sort of earthquake happens. And as of movies of this type tend to be, its not the mist itself that you've gotta worry about but what lurks within it.<br /><br />Its a great movie and truly engaging. Director Frank Darabont has a way with actors and you've gotta give this guy credit. Given, he has a stable of regulars whom he works with quite often that are all clear cut professionals but he always manages to get top notch efforts from them, whoever they may be. It's also nice to see a few faces from his \\"Walking Dead\\" series here but that's just my own side bit of appreciation. The actors take what is essentially a B-movie and make it into something so much more just by the way they give their all into their respective roles. Thomas Jane is one of my favorite actors and I think he does dynamite work here, bringing his usual everyman demeanor into the role of David Drayton and owning it through and through. Everybody and I do mean everybody is truly at the top of their form in this film, especially Marcia Gay Harden who plays a truly deranged ultra-Christian with her own ideas of how to handle the terrible situation these people are in. And I have to make mention of Laurie Holden's eyebrows, which turn in a stupefying performance all their own.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray looks and sounds great with the usual supplements in tow. I find Darabont a joy to listen to on his commentaries and there's even a small interview he has with Stephen King that's a must watch for fans. The behind the scenes feature is a bit of fluff but still worth a watch.<br /><br />The best part about this package is that the film is presented in black and white on a separate disc, complete with an intro as to why they even bothered to include a version such as this by Darabont. I'll let you listen to it for yourself but I have to say, watching the film in black and white is pretty much the way to watch it and adds a quality to it that brings to mind the classics of yesterday, especially George Romero's classic, \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". The contrast especially is high, with stark blacks and bright whites that make the film jump out of your screen in a way that color, believe it or not, just doesn't do for the film. If you do pick this disc up, make sure you watch the black and white version. Darabont certainly loves movies and I think he loves his viewers just as much.and white on a separate disc, complete with an intro as to why they even bothered to include a version such as this by Darabont.

Even starting at the first level, this workout is surprisingly intense. It gave me quick results as far as weight loss, and I did build my endurance quickly (who knew 1 minute of jumping jacks would be that tiring at first?) I love how you switch between activities enough that the time flies by. I use this as a little extra workout at home if I can't get to the gym, or if I just need a little boost.
B003UYUQZW|2.0|A few years back I may have enjoyed a movie like \\"Prince of Persia,\\" marveling at the gimmicky special effects and cheap set designs because I did not know any better. However, being more learned in film after taking a few film courses in my university while also taking the time to watch movies that are actually worth a damn, I realize how shallow movies like Prince of Persia really are, not-to-mention how daft many movie producers and filmmakers think audiences are for making this rubbish. The director, Mike Newell, firstly, was not the right man to take on this project. He is a skilled director in his element, which is comedy and drama, but he fails to deliver smart action films. I, personally, am a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and I felt his adaptation of Goblet of Fire was the biggest disappointment in the series, and not because the film failed to entertain me, but because the director was most concerned with making a gimmicky action flick than paying respect to an immensely character-driven and dense story. He does the same with this film. Although I've never played the game, I've seen enough of it to know that it could have inspired one heck of a great film. If a director like Ridley Scott or even Ron Howard would have signed on, you know you would have been seeing one very substantial action film. However, what Mike Newell presents us with here is a splotchy, choppy, and claustrophobic mess that lacks a set continuity and that drags when it has the opportunity to soar. I would have presented the same argument for other Disney live-action films like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but those movies at least had some very interesting set pieces and very authentic character presentation and development. For one thing, the actors in Pirates were at the top of their game, and they were not as implausible as Jake Gyllenhal's Prince. Another thing about Pirates is its production values. Observe how well Gore Verbinski chooses to shoot his scenes, presenting vast oceanic landscapes in all of their mysterious glory and showing Pirates in all of their swashbuckling and teeth-rotting splendor. Their costumes were weathered and soiled with age, as if those pirates have never had time for a bath, let alone a place to wash their clothes. Now, going back to Prince of Persia, you visualize characters with perfect teeth as if the ancient persian empire had a means of acquiring  good dental hygienists and some very good laundromats. Even brainless blockbusters should strive for authenticity, especially when the film took two years to make.     One other complaint of mine was the cheesy and cramped cinematography. Rarely was there a scene that visually immersed me, since the camera-work was too abrupt and seemed digitally revamped. Movies like this, that attempt to work at an epic scale (\\"attempt\\"), should have cinematography that suits its purpose. Movies like the latest Robin Hood and Lord of the Rings come to mind. Many of the frames and overall scenes in those two films are vast, allowing the audience to take in the atmosphere and the setting. Prince of Persia doesn't allow its audience to do that; it was a very limiting visual experience.     Overall, I did not find much to like in this film. I don't think director Mike Newell has formed an aptitude for making substantial action flicks. He lacks a certain humane sensitivity that he somehow does not lack in his dramatic films. Maybe he should retrace his steps and create a story that pays homage to what he was originally good at. If he can mix strong character development with an artistic eye, he will be able to create one very good action movie; but, until then, he hasn't made the cut in my eyes.    If you're in the mood for some brainless action that provides some fun (although very far between), then you might find something to like in Prince of Persia. However, if you're someone like me who lately has an appetite for well-made films in general, those films that donot sacrifice one essential element of the story to focus on another, less valuable one, will be very disappointed, because although the film does provide some cheap thrills, it does not maintain that element which will allow it to pass the test of time; therefore, it serves no other purpose than to make money for its studio. Other directors could have done better and have done better. Even Pirates of the Caribbean, which I have aforementioned, is more of a visual and intellectual delight (and I'm sure both sets of movies will be compared when they should not) than Prince of Persia.     I hope this review has helped. It's worth seeing at least once, but it surely has no replay value.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|This remake of the spectacular Swedish film \\"Let The Right One In\\" is worth watching.  Featuring a child vampire trapped forever at the physical and mental maturity of a 12 year old, it provides a nice twist on the vampire mythos and plenty of good bloody violence.  You will also get to enjoy the disturbing feeling that you have been somehow compromised by this film, probably because it gets you to cheer for a devil, just because she is cute and fun to watch.
B0000027G6|5.0|Years ago,on NPR, I heard what is probably the best-known part of the Dances With Wolves soundtrack. Now and then, after that, I would hear it again. It wasn't enough. I searched book-and-music stores and secondhand shops but didn't find the actual soundtrack until I went to Amazon. This music was worth the wait! ALL of John Barry's music is worth the wait! While searching for THIS soundtrack, I began finding other of his 'MovieMusic'. NOW I knew why I loved the track from Out Of Africa and Somewhere In Time. John Barry wrote those and more than 30 others, as well as a wonderful CD of compositions (not MovieMusic, in this case).<br /><br />I've gone off track (yes, over John Barry!), but only to emphasize that this CD, Dances With Wolves, is as truly beautiful as any music he has ever written. He wrote music for movies for 40 years, beginning as a very young man. He died this year, much sooner than he should have. His legacy of music enriches all who listen. Dances With Wolves is filed with truly favorite music which I play often as part of an assortment while writing, painting or simply to carry the day. As with any really favorite thing, it's good to pace myself a little, otherwise I could just possibly begin to get tired of it. That must never happen! Give Dances With Wolves a good listen! I bet you can't listen just once.
B000002U82|5.0|There is little that hasn't been said to compliment this recording.

B002AFX52S|5.0|If you know Kurosawa, then a summary or critique of the film is pointless. If you don't know Kurosawa and hesitate to approach foreign language cinema, know this: he is a God to Steven Speielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and John Milius among others. His films are a unique combination of epic storytelling and heartbreaking empathy, and Kagemusha is one of his grandest spectacles, all in bewitching color.<br /><br />If you know the Criterion Collection, then you'd think you know what to expect from one of their BluRay transfers. You'd be wrong. Travel back in time to when this film came out and chances are it has never looked this good: it's like watching your own pristine 35mm print, or as close to that as anyone can ever reasonably hope for. And the extras are legion.<br /><br />Pricy? Perhaps, but worth every last penny.

0439023513|4.0|This review is a long time coming.<br /><br />I actually finished this book last year, but I had to take a break from writing reviews since I had done quite a few. However I'm here to review again, lol. Obviously, Mockingjay is the final book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. I won't spoil it for you but I will say that it was a satisfying ending to a powerful and provocative series. I had dismissed this trilogy at first for a long time, afraid that it would be nothing more than just another sub-par lackluster YA series in the same vein of a certain vampire \\"saga\\". I was taken aback at how well written these books were. I'm usually not a big fan of the first-person narrative but Collins was able to pull it off without forgetting her other characters. Mockingjay is just as engaging as its predecessors and even included a satisfying twist just before the end. It did feel a bit rushed which is why I gave it four stars but don't let that stop you from picking up this stellar novel.<br /><br />I highly suggest this book for everyone of all ages. Collins has produced an excellent YA novel without a single sex scene or curse word, which I'm sure is a big plus for parents. I also suggest you read the first two books before picking up this one.

0060765488|5.0|This is probably one of the most popular fantasy books out there, especially for the younger set.  When the movie came out (which I also loved) it just furthered the popularity of this series.  While it can be read as a stand alone, I recommend reading the complete series for the full richness and history that is contained for the world of Narnia.<br /><br />When Lucky, Edmund, Peter, and Susan have to go to the countryside to escape the air raids and war, they stay with a kindly professor at his rather large house.  There is plenty to explore, and it is on a rainy day that Lucy finds a magical doorway to another world, inside the wardrobe in a spare room.  She quickly makes a friend in a faun and learns of the evil White Witch who fancies herself Queen of Narnia.  The other children don't believe her about her adventures though, and this is even worse for her when Edmund comes through too but lies about it to the other children.  Finally and quite by accident they all make it to Narnia and learn that they have been expected.  Aslan, the great lion, wants to see them and they set out to meet him and help him with his fight against the White Witch.  However, they experience a setback when Edmund defects to the witch's side and they feel sure that he is lost to them.<br /><br />The characters, despite this being a short book, are very well done.  I love Lucy and think she is charming and sweet.  Peter is rather noble and distant, and Edmund of course is a complete brat in the beginning of the book without hardly any redeeming qualities.  The other characters are quite nice as well and it is easy to see that Aslan has a regal bearing.<br /><br />The writing is great and definitely the most appropriate for kids (adults might find the story a little rushed) and while there are battles there is not extreme violence in this book.  In fact, the only thing I found offensive was Father Christmas saying women shouldn't fight in wars, but that could just be the small bit of feminist in me.  There are Christian tones, but they aren't strong in voice and are rather just a background to the story itself.  It is read more as a fantasy novel, and highly appropriate that way.<br /><br />I love the series and especially this book and read it over and over.  I don't think I could ever tire of it.

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I loved this book!  I thought that the way the author switched POV between Alex and Brittany really worked.  It allowed the reader to see each side as this young couple struggle to overcome prejudices and their peers expectations. It showed how the same situation was percevied two differnt ways.  Switching POV allowed the reader to understand two characters that would otherwise seem unsympathetic. The love story was sweet, and the couple definitly has \\"chemistry\\" together.  Alex was a likeable hero even though he was a gang member.  Brittany was sympathetic even though she was a rich girl.  Some have said that the ending was unrealistic.  I don't know what I think about that, but I do know it was very satisfying. I was happy at the end and that is all that matters to me at the end of a book.  If you like YA romance or just teen drama books, this is a good one.  Even if you like adult romance novels, I think most would be pleased with this novel.
1582701709|1.0|Skip this book that advocates deluding oneself (i.e., through the use of positive thinking) in order to \\"create\\" reality. It is a mindless read written by an opportunistic and delusional woman who doesn't seem to grasp the last 100 years of science, psychology, or physics and seems to believe we are all Jedi knights who can bend reality to our will. To give a glaring example of this woman's madness, she blamed the tsunami victims for not having enough positive thoughts (thus the tsunami was attracted to their negative energy). Thus the book is a bunch of bunkum that highlights one of the foundational problems in modern America: the delusional belief that positive thinking (by itself) can just create beneficial outcomes, a delusion that is both harmful and absurd. For one, most genius, especially of the past, has been tortured, riddled with self doubt and incredibly insecure; the same can be said for many of the successful today. So use common sense and stay away from this tripe.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have a Bugaboo Cameleon, and this product works great!  It hangs vertically when attached and there are no problems folding the chassis with it still attached.  The cup holders aren't super great for waterbottles that are fairly tall, but will still hold it ok.  I actually use both this caddy and the \\"Jolly Jumper\\" caddy together.  The Jolly Jumper caddy works really well for anytype of waterbottle, but this one is better for holding snacks, sunscreen and miscellaneous items.  This one hangs where the knobs to adjust the handlebar height are and the other one stays up near the top.
B000065V42|1.0|There is one thing you must know. This is a HORROR MOVIE!  Yes, it is a classic. Problem is it is just as scary as it is famous.Oh, sure it might sound funny or cute at first, but there is more to a movie than fame and a funny title. I must be truthful. This movie is very freaky, nightmarish and dull. The special effects are  too high-tech, and there are many scenes that will scare children: 4 kids are accidentally shrunk to 1/4 inch tall thrown out with the garbage. Now in the backyard they face one  terrifying danger after another. people walk trough the yard and almost squash them. one girl falls in to a mud puddle and nearly drowns. one boy almost gets carried away by a bumble bee. Worse of all, they almost get killed by a lawnmower, and when finally back inside, one boy almost gets eaten in a spoonful of Cheerios by his own dad!. These are only a few of the of the horrifying, scary scenes in this movie! I am 20, and this movie freaks me out,so it will certainly freak out young children.    If you want a science-fiction, action packed triller movie that is funny and child-friendly, try the sequels!   After all, Some things take more than one try to get  just right, and may not be perfect the first time round.But will get better the 2nd  and 3rd time round!
B003CRM6QO|2.0|Not sure why I bought this movie sight unseen.  I did not even bother to read reviews.  I guess I like sci-fi and enjoyed the old flash gordon cartoons as a kid.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly corny and flamboyant.  I like it to the old batman and robin tv show.  The musical score is pretty darned irritating.  The only thing I can say is that the story has a happy ending and the transfer quality of the movie is great.
1603425381|5.0|Not sure what kind of a border to use on your   crocheted item? This little book helps to simplify  the process. The instructions are clear and easy to  follow.     I took this book my \\"Afternoon Crochet and Knitting  Group.\\" It was a big hit and several of the ladies  are going to purchase one for their personal library.
0316098337|5.0|I read a few books each month, more in the summer - and this was hands down just a wonderful book, a gem.  The best I've read in a while and I can sometimes be picky.  Being a mom of a six-year old, I could really admire the choices of the mother in the book, and I really enjoyed seeing the world through Jack's eyes.  I understand how some reviewers don't appreciate this point of view.  It might depend on whether you are a parent or not..or what your feelings about parenting are.  This book is written in a different way compared to other books..and the childish phrasing and word usage is something to get used to.  But really, this story could be told no other way.  Jack's character is courageous, charming, entirely lovable and even witty at times.  You will easily fall in love with him.  What is wonderful about the book is even through his perspective, you can see the wise choices his mother makes even without Jack understanding them.  You can feel her strong love for her son through the things she has them do together - more than just having her say 'I love you' to him.  In fact, I don't know if such a sentence is ever in the book.  Together they both make an unlivable situation a loving situation...a situation where Jack thrives and grows because he knows no other life.  This is the substance of the book..along with other plot points that I won't get into here.  If you find the bond between parent and child appealing to you then I think you will enjoy this book.  Don't expect a long, twisting, engrossing plot - this is not a mystery novel..the entire book spans about a couple weeks, and is more about the events, both major and minor, that occur through Jack's eyes.     At times, this book reminded me of 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy...just the isolation of a parent together with their child - and the child looking at the world through a very different perspective compared to the parent.  'The Road' is of course very gloomy though.  Both books will break your heartand you will ache for these characters.  'Room' gives more hope than 'The Road' though.
0811870413|3.0|The book is rather verbose and the embedded recipes are sometime a little vague. It may be my fault, but baking with other texts was much easier than with this one.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert has picked a super supporting cast and the album shows it. He truly has put together a Band of Joy! Buddy Miller and Patty Griffin have gotten all the ink; and they are very talented. However in my not so humble opinion Darrell Scott is The Man! If you ever get a chance to see him in concert don't pass it up! I guarantee you'll be glad you went.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great sci-fi doesn't come around very often.  I'm talking modern classics like The Matrix (first one only), Gattaca, etc.  I think Inception joins the list.  It is very well acted and cast.  The visuals are stunning.  The concept and storyline are engaging and thought-provoking.  This is a movie that has tremendous replay potential.<br /><br />It is nice that the blu-ray was only $14 on Amazon.  Even better is that it has a DVD disc included also as well as digital copy.  It costs so little to add the DVD that I don't know why more studios don't do it.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|Rod Stewart's renditions of these classic songs from The Great American Songbook are fabulous.  His unique sound spices the songs up enough to give you a sense of now with the kind of lyrics that actually say something.  Romance is back again with these recordings.
030746363X|5.0|I loved The 4-Hour Body enough to hit the blog and see author Tim Ferriss's plea that we help him crush George \\"The Decider\\" Bush's Amazon stats between two kettlebell-swing sculpted buttocks.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body's potential contributions to your life: great(er) times in the sack, a higher sperm count (or sperm facilitation count, for the un-testicled), improved athleticism and a hotter body.<br /><br />Compare that to George Bush's specialities: complicity in torture, a fractured economy and a scrambled marshaling of the forces of ignorance for a war on terror that's terrifying with very little help from actual terrorists.<br /><br />I'm actually buying both digital and paper copies of The 4-Hour Body for both portability and comfy home reading, because using it has enormous potential for awesomeness, or -- even better -- potential for helping me unleash new levels of my own awesome. It's an amazing, unique piece of work, and if you read it, you'll see why.<br /><br />I'm a competitive kickboxer and I've dabbled in various strength protocols with no noticeable performance benefits for my sport. More recently I've been hemming and hawing over Cross-Fit and paleo, but they seem to demand commitment, unpleasantness and flashback of high-school gym class for rather nebulous returns.<br /><br />4HB has already helped me articulate what I want, as well as sharing some blueprints for ways to get it. I now know that I want clear instructions and assessments that make sense over the short term. I want to get stronger but spend more time having fun (kicking people in the head) than dragging heavy things around just because I'm supposed to. I don't want to suffer any more than I have to to make weight. And, I want a cure for my ABD (Asian Butt Disease.)<br /><br />It looks like I may get some things I really want from The 4-Hour Body. And if you have the relatively unusual combination of open-mindedness and an ability to follow directions, you might, too.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|I enjoy the series so it is no surprise that I enjoy re-watching these episodes at my convenience. Several episodes have an Army officer \\"interacting\\" with Gibbs; I found these annoying and felt this was out of character for Gibbs. This change detracted from the overall enjoyment of watching the DVD and was why I reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.
B001B7CNY2|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 4.5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />guys, this is really a great, exciting movie.<br />tons of action, special effects and so much more.<br />historicaly accurate my foot, if you critique about that, the studio should have made a documentary instead of a really good war ' movie'
B000053V7Q|5.0|With the 1970 shows, Elvis starts a long array of concerts with the same musicians he met the previous year.  The reahersal at Hotel show a laughing Elvis, kidding all the time, very enthusiastic.  The Las Vegas performance is simply blowing you away...So much energy, great style, a mix of \\"old\\" and newer songs, arranged by Elvis.  special mention for \\"you don't have to say you love me\\" (Springfield)  and \\"You've lost that lovin' feeling\\" (everly Brothers)  and \\"Polk salas annie\\"  Elvis' version just leave the original behind !!!    \\"Suspicious minds\\" is definitely the peak time of the show, Elvis shows more energy than an H-Bomb, he sends any of today's \\"artists\\" back to kinder garden...
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is simply the best film of 2010. Everything from the script to the convincing performances by its actors make this picture a must-see and a soon to be classic.<br /><br /> The movie deals with Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, who deals with a severe stammering problem. The movie follows his stuggle with his speech impediment, his anxiety over becoming the King of England knowing he will have to make public speeches to thousands while possessing this problem, and his attempts to overcome his stutter.<br /><br /> As someone who suffers from a speech disorder for the majority of my life I could relate to this film immensely. Colin Firth (who plays Prince Albert) does an extraordinary job in portraying someone with a stammer. Watching him you would actually believe he (Colin) suffers from the same impediment in real life: that is how convincing Colin's performance is.<br /><br /> Queen Elizabeth of England was able to watch the movie in a private screening in January, 2011 and was very touched by the film as Prince Albert, Duke of York was her real-life father.<br /><br /> Colin Firth would go on to win all the major Best Actor wins at different awards ceremonies for this role, but more importantly he won a well-deserved Oscar as Best Actor at the 83rd Academy Awards on February 27, 2011. The movie was nominated for an impressive 12 Oscar nods, winning Best Director for Tom Hooper, Best Original Screenplay (David Seidler), and \\"The King's Speech\\" was named Best Picture.<br /><br /> The movie grossed an amazing $236,000,000 at the worldwide box office on an $8,000,000 budget making it a certified hit.<br /><br /> Like writer David Seidler stated at the Oscars upon winning the golden statue, \\"\\"The King's Speech\\" has given a voice to all stammerers throughout the world\\". I could not have said it better. I thank Colin Firth for his honest portrayal and convincing me that there is help for me in overcoming this problem and I thank the film makers for their excellent job on creating such a heartfelt and endearing movie.creating such a heartfelt and endearing movie.
B004529NKM|1.0|I love dance movies but this one just sucked. The picture quality was good (except for the terrible slushy graphics). The audio was the most annoying part. Every single dance move they do has a cheesy sound effect. Drives me crazy!!! The stupid sound effects are louder than the music! And speaking of music, the song choice in this movie were terrible! And if that wasn't enough, the protagonist dance team was terrible compared to their competition (especially the team they faced in the first round). The whole movie was just a disaster.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I first watched this movie when I was very young. I watched this classic movie again and again like every 10 years and still not tire of it.  As other review said. This new blu-ray's color is so live and beautiful. The surround sound is so good. You won't regret buying this  even you have the DVD version
044654759X|4.0|This book was so amazing-I had to read it way past bedtime. I stayed in my bathroom. I have a bathroom attached to the bathroom.<br />I felt that she was so clever, the way she got away. To buy a cell phone and have the calls to the house directed to the cell phone-that was so amazing. Well, she had to get far away and maybe she researched it at the library. She had to get away or else she would be killed.<br />The love story between Katie and Alex was so wonderful. He loved her unconditionally-how wonderful. He was there for her when she needed him the most. He was a courageous, real man who also wanted love-both to be loved and to get love in return.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is simply one of the best, ever, not just of the past year. The lyrics and the music mesh in a way that I have not heard in any work except maybe Elvis Costello. That is not to say this music is like Costello's-- it is more a combination of the Pogues with bluegrass with the intensity of Taiko drums.     Buy this album and listen as you drive about. You will feel suspended on air.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Season 8 was spectacular!  So sad to see the series come to an end.  I've seen them all - like them best on DVD - can't stand the cliffhangers since they make you wait a week.  Perfect ending.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|I always knew George Michael as a talented composer and musician.  However, when I watched this concert I was completely in awe of his showmanship. The kickin' band and the visuals are worth every penny of this concert release. His perfectionist spirit is evident in the production value.  As well, you can tell he loves his audience as much as his craft.  He brought the house down in London!!!
B000UD0ESA|3.0|A genuinely good film, but i was after the directors cut, which has a different ending  THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT  overall a good film
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|If you are a true Star Trek fan (like me) and grew up with the original Star Trek series that ran from 1966 to 1969, then this collection of Star Trek movies is for you!  I bought this collection of big screen Star Trek movies and am glad that I did!  Granted they are standard DVDs and not Blu-Ray, but the movies are there in their entirety and I loved seeing them back-to-back (particularly Star Trek II, III, and IV as they are all tied together and are considered to be a trilogy of sorts).  The central characters in these movies are timeless and iconic in nature, and these movies (along with the 2009 movie by J.J. Abrams) will always be the ones that I remember the most.  The four movies that featured Star Trek: TNG characters were not as well done (the major exception being \\"First Contact\\", which featured the Borg, the first visit to Earth by Vulcans, and Zefram Cochrane) and are mostly forgettable in nature as they did not feature stories that were as well-tied to that series that these movies are to the original Star Trek series.  I might appear to be biased (and I am), but the cast of the original Star Trek is the one I have grown up with since I was five years old and the series itself was originally aired during the time that we were just beginning to send men into space and to the moon and it made the series that much more interesting to me at that time.  Needless to say, when the first Star Trek movie first premiered in theaters in December of 1979, it was a greatly anticipated event that came to pass after ten years of rumors and speculation concerning a big screen treatment and resurrection of a series that had been cancelled prematurely by NBC, but never truly died in the hearts of its fans.  Again, if you are a true fan of the original Star Trek series, and you loved even just one or two of the movies that were made between 1979 and 1991, you should consider purchasing this collection.  You won't regret it!
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I taped the whole concert that day on my VCR. I have to transfer them to  dvd but I have to edit out Sally Fields and the V J's talking. I thought about buying this and not do the transfer but it does not have all that I have. Queen was outstanding with Freddy Mercury.
B004MMEIK0|4.0|I got this book because it was free and was pleasantly surprised.  While I don't think it's a book that I'll read multiple times, it had a good story line and was different than other vampire books I have read.  It kept me interested enough to read it all in one day. It's your basic story line- girl's in trouble, heroic vampire saves her while trying to win her heart- but the plot has a few twists that made me laugh.  Overall, it was a good read- I'll be checking out her other books in the series!
1416550542|4.0|This is a tale told on a windy coast and lived in a cottage where one is not quite accepted at the big house.  I enjoyed it, though sometimes it puzzled me.  Maybe that's the mark of a great book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent story and one of my top five books.  1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, Atlas Shrugged are the others.
B000001GXF|5.0|[[ASIN:B000001GXF Schubert: Trout Quintet, Death and the Maiden / Amadeus Quartet]]  This performance, by a truly first-rate group of musicians, is music that may serve to console one who is troubled. Even though conditions may be less than favorable to the listener, the harmony and variations of the performance tend to uplift the soul.
B00004RF9I|5.0|You have to search far and wide for satire of this quality. Imagine writers for The Onion, The Daily Show, and Mad Men collaborating on a send-up of the news media, with David Fincher directing. Undoubtedly, this film should be studied for ages for its prescient messages and skillful acting. The howling speeches become a little grating in the second half of the film, but their ability to concentrate Paddy Chayefsky's perceptive critiques of modern life redeems them. Not enough has been made of the film's take on the co-opting of the counter-culture - its observation that the media commodifies and thus helps extinguish radicalism. I bet Noam Chomsky got a kick out of this one.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|Honestly the movie was eye catching Yet very boring I didn't want to watch it yet I did because I wanted to know what happened. It is definitely not something i'd tell someone to buy. Rent it from the redbox if you have an urge to see it. The title says it all. The entire movie he's burried! Had a good story to it just wasn't as interesting and thrilling as I enjoy.
0671027344|5.0|This book has to be the most influential book that has reached my life. It has changed a lot for me including the way I view things. I don't have much time, but you would be doing yourself a huge favor by just picking this book up. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
B004ID52YO|3.0|I'm not going to lie, I found out about White Lies while I was playing Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. I soared though the beautiful road with beautiful environments flying past me, with \\"Bigger than Us\\" playing in the background. It was absolutely euphoric.    So I bought \\"To Lose My Life\\" from them via Amazon download and it completely blew me away. \\"Place to Hide\\", \\"Fifty on Our Forehead\\", \\"Death\\", hell, the entire album was just one beautiful masterpiece. Every song was beautiful, and I couldn't stop listening to the album for weeks, even now. Naturally I pre-ordered \\"Ritual\\", because \\"Bigger than Us\\" was still probably my favorite song from White Lies.    It really depresses me to say that it did not live up to my expectations, at all. There were some pieces in there that I liked a little, but honestly, I can't even remember their names. Many of the songs sounded very similar, and completely lacked any impact on me. I was really happy to hear the studio version of \\"Bigger than Us\\", which I still listen to like crazy, but everything else is just...bland.    I really hope White Lies gets better in their next album. It's tough to beat \\"To Lose My Life\\" but \\"Ritual\\" was really an enormous let down, too much for me to bear. I do regret buying the album and wish I just bought \\"Bigger than Us\\" but if my money helps them to stay in business and make a better album the next time around, then I will feel much better about it.
B003PIUC02|5.0|We found this to be a very well put together movie. Nicely done, with enough violence to capture the men, a fantasic love story to interest the women and  plenty of other events that will keep everyones eyes on the show!
B000641D2Y|5.0|I love this movie.  I have watched both 1 and 2 since I was a small child.  I can't wait to share these movies with my kids when they are old enough to appreciate them.
B003EYVY0E|3.0|I kept putting off purchasing Years 3 & 4 of the Ultimate edition after having read multiple reviews, reporting that WB did not include the extended versions of the films, which existed in Years 1 & 2. I too still have the WB's commercial, where they promise that each Ultimate edition set will contain extended versions. I have therefore felt cheated.   I have since decided to buy these two sets, but only for the following reasons: I've been patiently waiting for the Ultimate editions ever since Year 1 was filmed way back then (2001). I never bought neither the DVDs, HD-DVDs nor BluRays of the films so as to avoid double- or even tripple-paying once the maxed out box sets become available (as many people knew they would). Thus these Ultimate editions will be my first purchase of every HP film. I'd also like to keep the continuity in the boxes, collectables and the excellent extra materials from Years 1 & 2 box-stes. Finally, if the WB later audaciously decides to produce the extended versions of Years 3 & 4 and put them on sale without a swap-in option for the existing Ultimate edition box-set owners, I would feel forced to download them from some file-sharing service as I am already paying for them with this Ultimate box-set, as advertised, but not delivered by WB.  My only hope is that WB will not botch the final three Years and that Years 3 & 4 will be the only dark spots in they reputation.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I went to the movies on December 18th,2010. I bought my $15.00 ticket and than sat down just before the movie started. Know before watching the movie, I thought that the amazing music that I heard in the trailers, Wouldn't be in the movie. I was so wrong. The movie, the music, the visual effects, the acting, and even the propts in the movie were beyond amazing. I came out of the movies with my eyes bulging out at the awesomeness of this movie. I would have seen this movie a million more time in theaters. But the price for 3-D is $15.00. I will definetly buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.

0393316041|5.0|The Feynman book is a delight, full of humor,anecdotes, and interesting philosopy. An easy read for those with at least some technical background, but highly recommended regardless. it was recommended to me by a felow techie, and being a Physcist, I ordered 2.  The extra as a gift. Couldn't put the book down, enjoyed it thoroughly. Reminded me of my youth at times and also of similar experiences during my career.  A delight to read , a giggle, and also very astute/thoughtful.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I have been using the moshi MiniDisplay Port to HDMI adapter for just over a month to connect my Mac Pro to the TV across the room. The moshi does a fine job, allowing me to watch Netflix, Hulu, and Day9 from the couch; but, there are a couple of difficulties with this setup caused by the other members of the system. First, the HDCP handshake does not always complete properly--sometimes resulting in short periodic sound outages--requiring a power cycle from the Mac and the TV. Second, the constant connection with the TV causes OS 10 to identify the second monitor (even when it is off). This lack of sophistication in the OS is easily remedied with some shareware (SwitchResX Control).    Overall the setup is quite nice: with apps like Plex I have the 10-foot GUI of boxee/apple tv like systems (without having to pay for XBox Live gold or Hulu Plus!) but without having to sacrifice the versatility of VLC and Perian. While others have noted a degradation of quality from the moshi and similar adapters over time, I have not experienced this in the month I have been using it.    Now if only GOM TV would make their player for OS 10...

B0044XV3R8|1.0|I saw this twice just to make sure.. And I have to say that the visual effects are  amazing. But everything else is utterly stupid. Why, because of the fact that the first time I saw it,I nearly fell asleep and the second time got really bored fast  (and for the record I watch movies from the 40's to know and they can be slow, but this was extremely slow except for the end). SO if you want to watch a movie for the special effects and storyline, than you came to see the wrong movie. Instead go see Lord of the Rings.   In about 5-10 years people will look back at this movie and agree with me that this movie is dumb  Story:F+  Acting:D  Direction:B  Visuals:A-  Action:C
0060872675|5.0|I loved this book. The illustrations were awesome. I personally see Vimes and his wife a little differently in my head but I loved this interpretation of a discworld classic. My god son really enjoyed having this book read aloud to him. It gets requested again and again.

B0018YIFEK|5.0|My older sister bought me this book after reading it herself and falling in love with it.  It isn't the type of book I usually read, but since she loved it so much I figured I'd give it a chance.  I found it was amazing and couldn't put it down.  After I read it, I lent it to my younger sister.  She, too, couldn't put it down.  It is now one of my favorite stories of all time.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I think this movie is slow paced, but well worth watching.  The last 30 minutes of this show is so touching that anyone who does not cry (at least alittle) has either already seen it or has no heart.  I cried like a baby.  It is not the type of movie if you want to be cheered up.  Now having said that, I think the ending is so powerful that it is well worth a watch.  It is a very good movie and I recommend it highly. I did not read or see any previews on this movie and that made the ending so much better.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|i came to josh groban through his (amazing) performance in chess. for some reason i always imagined josh as stuffy or uptight since his music was so...classical-ish, theatrical, [some other word that i can't think of]. which is completely unfair and biased of me. i'm ashamed i thought that way. i have discovered josh groban is absolutely hilarious in rl. don't believe me? type in nevermind the buzzcocks + josh groban on youtube. but i digress. if josh's voice were a fist, i would want it to punch the universe in the face so everyone could hear just how amazing this ablum is. hyperbole, you say? no way.<br /><br />i know that there are a lot of negative reviews for this album, and i cannot, for the life of me understand why. i loved this album so much i went back and got closer and awake, and i STILL think this album is miles better. don't get me wrong, i enjoy the other albums, but this one is special. for one, i really like that josh has started writing his own music. the songs feel much more personal, and i love that. two, it's a freaking great album. i can't stress enough how good josh sounds.<br /><br />the songs are breathtaking. josh's voice is amazing. very strong, very powerful, very beautiful. i don't even like every song on the album, and i'd still give it six stars if i could.<br /><br />in particular, i find \\"the bells of new york,\\" \\"higher window,\\" and \\"voce existe em mim\\" amazing.<br /><br />but the song that totally blows me away, is \\"the war at home,\\" which i understand josh wrote after visiting walter reed hospital. this song gives me goose bumps every time i hear it.<br /><br />i have very eclectic taste in music. i love metallica, weird al, voltaire, the boy least likely to. and now i proudly add josh groban to my fav musician list. if you're a new fan of josh or old, don't listen to the naysayers. please give the album a listen. i'm certainly glad i did.<br /><br />p.s. if you liked josh in chess at all, you'll love this album.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|It's not as suspenseful as the first one because I get used to its filming style. It still has some suddenly scary moments but there are few of them.<br /><br />- The cleverest trick is it involves a baby. Any time the camera turned on the baby and his crib at night, I anxiously asked myself \\" My goodness, what's going to happen to him?\\". The anticipation of uncertainty was very suspenseful.<br /><br />Overall, it's worth watching once.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|i can't recommend community enough. not only is it a hilarious, but every member of the cast is perfect. i'm a huge fan of danny pudi and donald glover in particular. the entire cast is funny, but these two shine in every scene they're in. community pays loving tribute to dozens of tv shows/movies and tropes. it reminds me of spaced in a lot of ways, actually. i have laughed during every episode of this series, in fact, laughed so hard i cried. the first season pays tribute to john hughes movies, goodfellas, action movies, buddy cop movies, and more.  season 1 is worth owning for the billiards episode, chicken fingers episode, and \\"modern warfare\\" alone.<br /><br />not only is season one funny, the dvd set has a TON of extras that make the dvd totally worth owning. the cast and crew did commentaries for every singe episode. i'm not even a fan of chevy chase, yet the writing is so good, i like his character. or love to dislike his character, more accurately. community is very underrated; i find it funnier than modern family and big bang theory. spend a little time with the study group at greendale community. you'll be glad you did.
0201633612|4.0|Good. 4/5 because it is the first technical book which influenced the way softwares are developed.     If this is your first book on Design Pattern, you might feel the writing is too complex. I attempted to read this book number of times and gave up until now. It was possible only because I already know all of these patterns and I had read other books/articles.    I read this book just for the sake of reading, as it is still considered the father of all design pattern books. I'm not sure whether I learnt something new from this book or not. But it is recommended because it is considered as a tradition that all software engineers should read it once and all other books on design pattern always refer back to this book (I don't know why).    One thing for sure, although published in 1994 it lives up to the date but the examples are seriously out dated. Don't dare to read it as first book on design pattern.
0316098337|5.0|This book captured me. I was hesitant to read, skeptical that it was written from the perspective of 5 year old Jack. It was Jack's perspective though that moved me... his innocent, smart, loving and pure spirit. This book captures the essence of childhood; how children are wholly reliant on adults for safety, love, development and nurturing. Even in a hellish environment, Jack's Ma made his world whole. The bond between Jack and his fiercely protective and loving Ma is so realistically portrayed, it made me reflect on my own relationship with my daughter. I snuggled her closer every night after finishing this book.
0553212419|5.0|I loved this book. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to life. The stories are stimulating. The time and the locale was fascinating. I learned a great deal about life in the 19th century in London. Recommended book for all who love mysteries.
B0042KIAZ6|5.0|This is a great new rendition of the old show.    The cast is very suited to have you invest in the characters.    The writer keeps you coming back for more.    The show reminds me of a more comic book style Jack Bauer meets Sydney Bristow type of story.    Nikita is a show I'd spend hours watching over again. Definitely worth buying.
B002NJUN44|5.0|i loved it so much i enjoyed it anybody who critisizes it is horribly, horrificly wrong it was a fantasticly, wonderful movie ,whoever directed it made it astonishing! even if it was not very relative to the book it was still good although the books always are better and have more detail...... but still anybody who wants to buy it should it is very entertaining! p.s. dude who said you could tell they were acting everyone can because it is a MOVIE so how could you not tell! seriously by it!<br /><br /> 5 stars from me- anna banana
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This adaptation of Emma was amazing! I didn't want it to end... Romola Garai portrayed the exact Emma, and other casts were perfect too. I really loved music and the costumes were beautiful. I just loved it!!
B004FEFZU2|5.0|I am unable to play this on my new LED /LCD 3D Sony TV. Apparently not the correct network area. Dissapointed as ity said all you need is a 3D TV and a blu ray DVD player....not happy
B000025706|5.0|I agree with Sam about the quality of this set. I think he is unfair to Uchida, Perahia and (the young) Brendel (who can forgive his later 'decoration' of the A major for instance?), who have all produced some wonderful recordings; and I would never want to be without, say, Curzon playing the A major or the D minor, or Geza Anda playing number 21 or Gulda's faulty but heartfelt performance of number 25, Ashkenazy's insights and touch on the piano, etc.    But Schiff consistently presents (with, as Sam points out, the wonderful help of Vegh and a superb orchestra) performances that are satisfying at the highest level. They sound like Mozart unadorned, given with the utmost simplicity, thanks to the superb technique, but with a life, a personality that captures the grace and passion, the variety of emotion and the development of musical thought, that too often slip away from other peformers. I have been listening to this set for years now, and it is never stale, never showy, always at the service of the music
0385342047|5.0|I was really nervous about buying this book because of the negative reviews.  I am SO glad that I did.  I loved every bit of it.  I thought Becky was completely in character and Luke as well.  Nothing they did seemed any different from the other books.  I did wonder why they have not grown up any but at the same time that is part of this series appeal for me-they are hilarious!  Luke screws up, Becky screws up, but somehow they make it work.    I loved Becky's relationship with her parents and that her quirky family friends are more in this book as well.
B004JVXTL8|4.0|It was good for the scare here and there. The volume has to be way up so when things are loud, you will jump. Only part I really didn't like was the end.
B004AHNIGM|1.0|I've read all the other reviews, and I must say that everbody else must be listening to a different cd than I am!! This cd is terrible!!!!!!! One thing I donot understand is, this is Greg's 1st solo cd in 14 years, and he only writes one song on the entire cd? Thats shameful! The other thing I cannot get by is his voice. As evidenced on \\"Hittin' The Note\\" and \\"Low Country Blues\\", the mans voice is gone. I love Greg Allman and The Allman Brothers Band. I've been a big fan from the very start, but if this is the best he can do, it's time to bow out with grace. This cd gets no stars!!
B00007FOMP|5.0|Thank God I've inherited this masterpiece by Marvin Gaye. This is indeed one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />I used to listen to this album over and over again during my bus rides and displayed the infectious impact it had on me using hand signals and other movements to the relative music (nobody got hurt because of that).<br /><br />Featured on \\"What's Going On\\" are solemn, reflective, spiritual, realistic, cordial and motivating moods. A blase album.<br /><br />Even though this shouldn't be the sole determinant of getting this Marvin Gaye piece, \\"What's Going On\\" ranked at #6 of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|This watch is fantastic and I love everything about it.  Very lightweight for an automatic watch and is not loud at all.  It's got a great look to it, which I was unsure about with the tan strap.  The cost is great compared to competitors and other military style watches out there.  Seiko really made a good product in this one and I'm even tempted to buy a different color!
B001QWBM62|4.0|Overall, as with most Zoom products, this unit is a winner and cannot be touched by it's competition in it's price category except for perhaps the Olympus LS11 which is cheaper but the Zoom has a ton more features.  Build quality is good, features are good (the only unit in it's price range to have combi XLR / 1/4\\" TRS inputs) and it records to a high quality.  However, I think Zoom almost went too far with features and perhaps they could have focused more on making it THE BEST digital recorder under a grand and making it a great USB digital interface instead of spending money on the 4 track feature and all the built in effects and other fluff that works O.K. but is much more easily realized in a simple digital 4 track recorder (e.g a Tascam PocketStudio)  The manual is a farse in Japanese /English translation and any person that does not have experience with recording devices like this might really struggle to learn how to use this unit (although it's fairly intuitive to operate if one is familiar with such devices - I gave up on the manual and just dug around in the menus, but the unit is still a little 'fiddly' to operate in advanced modes.  My last comment is in regards to the H4n as a USB interface. I have played with it a bit and so far it does not make a good interface. First of all it is only 16 bit and I can only get it to work with MME drivers. I have read that there are some ASIO drivers available for Windows 7 but I use XP. I may try to use ASIO4all but it is still only 16 bit and therefore not much use for serious interface work. There is a direct monitor function but there still seems to be some timing issues when multitracking with a DAW software (I have only tried it with Cakewalk Sonar). I had hoped to use it with my laptop as a portable interface but sadly I can't seeing it being of much use in this regard.     However, overall the unit is stellar and I highly recommend it.    PS. I read some folks having issues with line inputs (e.g. recording a stereo mix from a mixer). I personally don't see the problem, the inputs are designed to accept a variety of signal types. If it is not working for your situation one can always use a TRS Hi Z unbalanced to XLR Low Z balanced converter, available at Radio Shack for around 20 bucks.
B002ZCY7PU|4.0|Chuck's Third Season, brings the story of Charles Bartowski to a personal level.  We see the love of family, the importance of friendship, and the need to share the truth.  Laughs and tears are involved in this season unlike the other two.

B004DMNT2W|5.0|I am a huge fan of Lowepro products and have been using them for all types of camera and video applications for over 15 years.  I can find no better brand of products to hold my video and camera equipment.  This bag is definitely Lowepro quality ... just a few things to point out.<br /><br />This little handy case is about carrying a camera and a couple of SD cards only.  Don't expect to be able to fit extra \\"stuff\\" in this particular case.  There are others in the Lowepro line that are compact and more roomy to accommodate these micro HD camcorders (palmcorders).  I would recommend the [[ASIN:B0007PO3EM Lowepro Edit 100 Camcorder Bag (Black)]] which gives more pockets and more room for cables, an extra battery, etc.  If that is not what you need, this little Lowepro pouch is a great option to protect your camera.<br /><br />This durable pouch boasts Lowepro tech materials and 4 different ways to carry it:<br /><br />1. via a hand strap<br />2. a wrist strap<br />3. via a belt loop<br />4. or placed in a larger bag<br /><br />Measurements for this pouch are:  3.1 x 3.3 x 5.9 inches or 8 x 8.5 x 15 cm<br /><br />The camera I tested this case with is the [[ASIN:B0032FPYZG JVC GZ-HD500 80 GB High Definition HDD Camcorder]] and it fits like a charm.  I wouldn't recommend this case for a FLIP or one of those other Flip type of camcorders as the elastic strap which is part of this bag's stability system probably won't hold it in place.<br /><br />For what this bag is, a pouch for a larger bag or temporary transport, it's a great option.  A LITTLE pricey at $22.00 for what it is but you do get what you pay for:  great quality.<br /><br />5 Stars.
0920668372|1.0|Really?  Grown woman creeps into her grown son's house at night (through his window, nonetheless), and sings to him like a baby?  Sweet?  No!  Moving?  No!  Creepy?  Absolutely!  I have three kids, I have a mother who is involved in my life, but the very thought of this book really makes me shudder.  Please, do not instill this type of thinking in your children at 2 years old, 9 years old, teenage years, grown up, etc.  Yes, love your son for your whole life, but not like this.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Had no expectations when I received this film.<br />Thought it was going to be another slightly entertaining B-movie.<br />A certain set of events moved rather fast and made me wonder a little bit.<br />Especially the way it happened and what was said by the characters.<br />Then a few scenes later I was flabbergasted.<br />And after that it kept throwing out ropes of disbelief.<br />Put me in the mind of certain sci fi films I have seen.<br /><br />And there is still one character who appeared near then end that I am wondering about.<br />I have an idea of what that character may represent but it may be nothing.<br /><br />Surprised me with its quality.<br />Good film.
B0013D8LKO|5.0|I saw Eyes Wide Shut for the first time when I was 13 and was aware, even then, that I had just seen a masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick's final film, which he completed editing just four days before his death, was met with lukewarm praise like all of his earlier films yet Eyes Wide Shut is arguably his most misunderstood masterpiece. Unlike his earlier films, this one hasn't been re-accessed much over the years, but it has been embraced by many because of the spell it casts and six years after seeing it the first time I still found myself in awe of its brilliance.    Starring then-couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the film opens brilliantly with a brief, elegant shot of Nicole Kidman disrobing. Kidman plays Alice Harford, Cruise plays Bill Harford. Bill is a doctor; Alice is a stay-at-home-mom to their seven-year-old daughter Helena. The film opens with them attending a lavish Christmas party held by one of Bill's wealthier patients Victor Ziegler (the late Sydney Pollack). This scene doesn't set the tone, so much as the theme of the film. Alice is hit on by a Hungarian man, while Bill is hit on by two beautiful women. Bill's rendezvous is interrupted when Ziegler needs his assistance with a girl who has OD'd. Later, after Bill and Alice have smoked a bit of weed, Alice reveals to Bill a sexual fantasy she once had about a naval officer. Bill leaves home, consumed by jealousy and embarks on a psychosexual odyssey that leads him to a grief-stricken woman expressing her love for him, an encounter with a hooker, and a mysterious costume party. In typical Kubrickian fashion, there is a cold detachment from the events. This is every frame a Kubrick film.    At 2 hours and 39 minutes, with long passages of little dialogue, Eyes Wide Shut may be slow-moving to some but I find it quietly hypnotic, endlessly fascinating, and never dull. Maintaining a dream-like feel, it gracefully draws you in and keeps a strong grasp throughout. There's a lot of mystery at the heart of EyesWide Shut and the fact that it's so impenetrable makes it difficult for some viewers to digest, yet even at an age when I was too young to understand the themes running through it I was engulfed in it's elegant spell. Kubrick was a master of atmosphere and, like most of his films; the atmosphere that hangs over this film exists only because of his unique style. There's not a film I can think of that engulfs me into the world it creates the same way.     Kubrick was an American who lived in London for the last several decades of his life and preferred to shoot his films there, substituting whatever setting his film required with London. Eyes Wide Shut takes place in New York, but his London setting never really looks or feels like the New York we're accustomed to seeing in movies. Some have pointed out Kubrick's \\"New York\\" as one of the film's major flaws. I think this is one of the film's greatest accomplishments. As a filmgoer, the dream-like atmosphere is reinforced and more effective by my unwillingness to accept the setting as New York. 30+ Woody Allen films and I've never seen New York have a more dreamy quality to it. There are six people credited for production design, art direction, and set decoration and they all did a flawless job here. Also flawless is the score by Jocelyn Pook, which incorporates previously composed music as well as original music and is an ominous, haunting, beautiful, and just marvelous score that stays with you long after the movie ends and is essential to the mood created throughout the film.     There is striking imagery and austere camerawork throughout the film, and I don't just mean the nudity that's frequently on display. Originally billed as an \\"erotic thriller\\" (which it's definitely not), there is much nudity but little eroticism. Even the controversial scenes that Warner Brothers chose to block with computer-generated figures in order to secure an `R' rating aren't pornographic or arousing in any way. Kubrick was not a director who filmed anything for gratuitous reasons. Warner Brothers rightfully restored these scenes to Kubrick's original vision in the unrated release (which claims to have both versions, but actually has only one...Which is fine, just odd). When discussing striking imagery, it's impossible to ignore the entire costume party sequence; a haunting, mysterious, and extraordinarily well-executed sequence as elegant as it is terrifying. This scene may perplex viewers, but it's a scene I haven't forgotten over the years and a scene only Kubrick could have filmed so gracefully. Had another director shot this scene it would have seemed too long, exploitive, gratuitous, and silly. Kubrick made it a work of art. Another favorite scene of mine is the scene at the costume shop, which is weirdly hilarious and memorable. Featuring a very young Leelee Sobieski and Mr. Milich (Rade Sherbedgia), one of Kubrick's most memorable minor characters, it's a scene that really puts Kubrick's dark sense of humor on display.    Tom Cruise gives one of his strongest, most quietly powerful performances with his then-marriage to Kidman adding an additional dimension to their dynamic. Bill Harford may not be a fully fleshed-out character that gives Cruise a lot to do, but he tackles this role with quiet menace. He plays much of the role with his facial expressions and his eyes, much as Kidman plays much of her role with her body. It is Kidman whose presence, seductive prowess, and body are responsible for some of the film's most well-known and identifiable shots. Sydney Pollack does some great work too as the malevolent Ziegler, as does Todd Field (an accomplished director) as Nick Nightingale, whose actions bring Bill into the dark underworld he ends up in.    There is something new I discover and question each time I watch Eyes Wide Shut, a film that only deepens my opinion that Kubrick never had a \\"peak\\" as a director. Even right before his death he was making a challenging, mesmerizing film that continues to be debated over just how good (or bad) it is. I personally can't comprehend the indifference that many have met this film with. It's such a marvelously textured film that I find more fascinating and more awe-inspiring with each viewing. Kubrick was a director of infinite skill and talent, who ended his brilliant career on one of his greatest and most misunderstood films and whose death is still a crushing loss to film-lovers even twelve years later. While time hasn't been much kinder to this film's reception, I hope in the years to come it will be acknowledged as the terrific film it is. Even the title Eyes Wide Shut is so perfect, as your eyes must be wide shut to not appreciate this film for the tremendous work of art it is.    GRADE: A
0765326353|3.0|I didn't enjoy this book as much as I wanted to, hence the three stars.  I found myself often bored to the point of putting the book down and not finishing it.  But I've read several of Sanderson's other books and I know he's always good for great ending, at least.  With that in mind, I expected the last fourth of the book to be pretty entertaining.  It wasn't until about the last 130 pages that the book finally picked up and tried to justify the 870 pages worth of buildup.  It didn't fail.  I'm now very interested in what happens next, but I felt like I had to slog through way too much to get to that point.  I know this is the first book of a 10 book series and Sanderson had to do a lot of world-building and character development.  I just think he could have condensed this book so much.  Maybe shed a good 300 pages.  Cut down on the characters' internal struggles by having them come to conclusions a little sooner.    My biggest issue was with the flashbacks.  I know he wanted to give us some background to Kaladin's character, but he could have structured the flashbacks so that he didn't pretty much tell us the outcome of the flashbacks before making us read through them.  There was one surprise in one of the flashbacks, although it was really just a continuation from the very first chapter and didn't need to be a flashback at all.  I think he could have put Chapter 1 in the flashback sequence and made Chapter 2 the first chapter.  Then he wouldn't have to already reveal the point of the flashbacks and they could have held a few more surprises.  It would have made Kaladin's past seem more mysterious until the flashbacks slowly revealed where he came from, which would in turn slowly shed light on his current condition and actions.  It might have even been better to give Kaladin amnesia until the flashbacks culminated with him regaining his memory.  He kept reminding us what the flashbacks were going to reveal, too.  I kept expecting the flashbacks to reveal somethingnew.    The ending was great, though.  It was really exciting to read.  Usually really long battle sequences give me a headache; especially Sanderson's battle sequences in the Mistborn series.  But he kept it interesting without being repetitious and it was one of the few times that his words really seemed to flow and I actually forgot I was reading a book.    I hope I haven't discouraged too many people from reading this book.  It's not terrible.  It's well written in a functional sense.  Sanderson's not a poet, but his prose isn't dull.  I thought his description was adequate and his characters, while not great, were well developed and distinguishable.  He's certainly getting better with each book.  I just think his editor needs to pull in the reins a little more.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have owned the DVD version of this for a while and have enjoyed the spectacular photography and narration.    I decided to see what the highdef version looked like.  The quality is just AMAZING!!.  If you really want to show off your TV and feel like you are actually on the site, this is one of the must have items (along with Life).  This is the origianl with the Richard Attenborough narration - accept nothing else.
