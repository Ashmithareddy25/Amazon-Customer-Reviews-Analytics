B00005JOE8|2.0|V for Vendetta, based on the graphic novels by British writer Alan Moore, is the first new film by the Wachowski Brothers since the final Matrix film. And we know how disappointing that series turned out to be. <br /> <br />The setting is in the not too distant future in the fascist police state of England, where deviant art, culture and sexual behavior is outlawed and nighttime curfews are strictly enforced. The public broadcaster is essentially the Ministry of Propaganda, and they put the government's spin on events to constantly cover up the truth about crimes of dissention. <br /> <br />Our protagonist wears a Guy Fawkes mask (the guy who tried to blow up the British parliament buildings in 1605) to conceal both his identity and his burned face. He rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) - who was on her way to dinner at a co-workers house - from a sexual attack by the curfew authorities (the \\"Fingermen\\"). <br /> <br />By coincidence, they ran into each other again at the public broadcaster's office, where he managed to air a pre-recorded explanation of his \\"terrorist\\" demolition of a government building (the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court) the night before, which the government tried to cover up by calling it a scheduled demolition. I didn't buy how she bonded easily and agreed to live with this creepy stranger so quickly in his windowless lair/deviant culture museum. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman is miscast as a Brit and but despite her poor attempt to fake the accent, her performance was all right. Hugo Weaving's \\"V\\" character is foiled by the useless cute aliteration in his opening scene as well as his quoting of the Bard to suggest his wit, intellectual depth and credibility of his largely symbolic mission. John Hurt plays the leader of the government, a Hitler-esque fascist, but he was largely one-dimensional. Stephen Rea as detective Finch does the best with his lines. <br /> <br />In the film, there is a conspiracy story regarding human experimentation, deliberate unleashing of deadly viruses, huge profits for the cure, people falsely arrested under the pretense of being terrorists, people concealing deviant sexual lives, etc. The story could have had more impact for me if there wasn't such an ambitious attempt to stage a spectacle, both visually and story-wise. <br /> <br />The Wachowski Brothers aren't known for carrying a story with subtlety and intrigue and instead hammer you over the head with action and scenes that could have been edited out. The story seemed squandered rather than focused and tight. <br /> <br />I wouldn't see this film again and give it a rating of 2/5. <br />

B000DZIGDU|1.0|This movie left me with a lot to be desired. No I wasn't looking for a lot of action and if that's what you're looking for, look for another movie. I didn't care for the storyline, I didn't think there was much of anything there. I didn't care for the acting. And back to the storyline, I felt there was a lot that was missing. I'm delighted that I didn't waste my money at the theater!! I am proud of the troops that were there in Desert Storm, along with the troops before and after that, however I feel like this movie was capitalizing solely on what is going on in the middle east right now! Thus why I think the studio released it, otherwise I don't think they would have bothered!!
B00004VYDW|3.0|It is rather amazing to consider how many other films resonate in \\"Showgirls,\\" the NC-17 film where the film was never equal to the hype. You have the chorus girl wanting to be a star plot line that goes back to \\"Morning Glory\\" and beyond, the back stage back biting of \\"All About Eve,\\" the stylized sexy dancing of \\"Flashdance,\\" the dancing auditions of \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"A Chorus Line,\\" the sleazy showbiz world of \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" the Las Vegas Glitz of \\"Oceans 11,\\" the falling down the stairs from \\"Kiss of Death,\\" the woman taking vengeance on her own angle of \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" and the naked dancing women of \\"The First Nudie Musical.\\" This list is enougth to convince me that what ever else it might be, \\"Showgirls\\" is not a \\"message\\" film.<br /><br />I know the film is now considered a camp classic rather than a mega-bomb, but neither description rings true for me. Nor would I consider the movie to be erotic, although I have no doubt that every lap dancer in the United States would resent the performance Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) puts on for Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan) while Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon) watches and wishes for her own turn in the chair. The scene in the pool is not bad, but it sure seems like all the brief scenes between Nomi and another woman have more heat than any of extended scenes with her and a man. Go figure. Besides, the idea of a putting out a big buck soft porn film is rather oxymoronic because those who find \\"Showgirls\\" to be a sexy film were never going to want to go to the local Cinemaplex to watch it; they were going to want to watch it in the privacy and comfort of their own home (it is not like those people were going to ever be able to get a date to go out and see this film).<br /><br />In the featurette on this DVD Joe Eszterhas takes time out from laughing all the way to the bank and back to tell us that \\"Showgirls\\" is really nothing more than a rock and roll musical, which makes sense except for the fact that the music is not exactly rock and roll and everybody is dancing rather than singing, which would make it some sort of ballet. But the idea that the film is a musical is worth considering because it is a simple way of explaining why Paul Verhoeven was the wrong director for this film. Verhoeven's approach is more than voyeur than the auteur and for the most part he does little more with the camera besides point it at the actors while they dance/writhe around (i.e., exactly what he did when Sharon Stone and Leilani Sarelle were on the dance floor together in \\"Basic Instinct\\"). I have to think that any director of a second level MTV music video could have shot and cut this film to much better effect. Then again, what better way of defining what is sexy in movies than to say that there is nothing in \\"Showgirls,\\" with its totally naked star, to rival Sharon Stone totally dressed (almost) in \\"Basic Instinct.\\"<br /><br />I do want to add that I do not think \\"Showgirls\\" is going to destroy Elizabeth Berkley's Hollywood career. All you need to do is to remember that Jessica Lange did a lot more than merely survive making \\"King Kong\\" and you have to think the actress will survive having bared everything (repeatedly) in this film. Berkley certainly turns in an earnest performance, and when she talks in the featurette about working hard so that the stripping was more like dancing than stripping per se, you have to agree that is an accurate description of what we see on screen. Ultimately, it is that the story is emotionally hollow. Nomi keeps insisting she is a dancer and not a whore, but it takes the entire film for her to learn these two things are not mutually exclusive.<br /><br />Besides the fact that we are supposed to root for the nobody to become somebody in stories like this, there is no reason to even feel sorry that Nomi does not understand this obvious point. Our sympathies are more with her friend Molly (Gina Ravera), the costume designer, and James Smith (GlennPlummer), the down on his luck dancer-choreographer, who cross Nomi's path. The film ends in a series of melodramatic showdowns at odds with the rest of the film and the final scene provokes the sudden suspicion that \\"Showgirls\\" was all one big joke. But maybe the fact that most likeable character in the film was stripper comedian Henrietta Bazoon (Lin Tucci) was a big clue. Then again, maybe there is not more here than meets the eye; maybe there is less.mith (Glenn Plummer), the down on his luck dancer-choreographer, who cross Nomi's path.

B000E5N62U|2.0|I have all of Steely Dan's Albums,but I do miss the Gary Katz Era Production along with the Joe Sample Runs on Keyboards. there have been two New Steely Dan Albums since the 2000 Era&they are both  Hit&Miss to me. this Album follows that&that ain't a good thing. yes the Playing is top notch&Production is crisp,but there is a element of surrpise lacking.this Album wasn't worth a 13 year wait. first of all nothing that Steely Dan as a Band or Solo is touching \\"Nightfly\\" From 82 since. that Album is one of the most underrated.\\"Kamakiriad\\" had some cool moments on it,but it worked better because there hadn't been a new release in quite some time. this Album I got closer to a 2.5 overall. there isn't that One song that knocks me out. good runs&Polished Production,but not that one song that would make me want to listen to this album over&over. still Donald  Fagen is a talented cat with Smooth Chops&Understands a Groove.
B00003CXMG|3.0|William Miller, played by Jason Lee Patrick Fugit, finds himself at a crossroads in his life when he is given an opportunity of writing a piece for the \\"Rolling Stone Magazine.\\" William, a fifteen year old kid, has never felt like he fits in with the rest of the crowd. He's smaller, smarter and just doesn't get what it takes to blend in with his peers.  This is a movie loosely based on director Cameron Crowe's life. It is about a teenage boy who wants to become a reporter for the Rolling Stone, so he joins the tour of Stillwater, an up and coming rock band. He deals with rejection as well as acceptance, and he even ends up falling in love.  Perhaps not worthy of the hype and vast praise that it has garnered, it is certainly an enjoyable film that does what it does well.
B00006JJ51|5.0|I'm reviewing &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; (1988) from a different perspective than most reviewers. While I like some rap and can certainly appreciate the genre, I'm not a huge rap fan. I'm a rocker, first and foremost, and this review is aimed specifically for people who aren't all that much into rap.<br /><br />N.W.A's debut &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; can be seen as the rap counterpart to Guns N' Roses debut &#34;Appetite for Destruction&#34; (1987). Released within a year of each other; both albums showcase tales of inner-city debauchery, drug and alcohol excess, with a sense of nothing to lose. Both albums feel very real, very lived in, and remain powerful sentiments of what it's like to grow up and live in abject poverty, through the eyes of society's misfits.<br /><br />Because the rap genre has become so saturated and mainstream, it's hard to imagine the impact &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; had upon its release and discovery. Little suburban white kids all across America heard first-hand accounts of life in the inner-city streets of the United States. I remember listening to this album back in the early 90s and remember what an impact it had on me. It dispelled a lot of myths by telling my totally ignorant brain what life is really like for oppressed minorities in the forgotten ghettos of what I had always been told was a great country, fair to everyone, regardless of race, color or creed (hey, I grew up in Reagan/Bush middle-America!) While rap sometimes seems to glamorize &#34;thug-life&#34; or wind-up as self-parody (a problem that would later besiege the post-Ice Cube N.W.A) this is never a problem with &#34;Straight Outta Compton.&#34;<br /><br />Honesty can get you only so far, however, without the skills. The reason &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; is as great as it is, is because of the enormous talent involved. Featuring a very young Ice Cube, Eazy E, MC Ren, Yella, and Dr Dre, N.W.A. was a supergroup of Rap/Hip-Hop's greatest talent before any of them had become known. Poetic lyrics flowing with ease; the songs, sometimes humorous, sometimes ugly, tell the listener the grim realities of urban poverty. Even at a very young age, it is apparent that all five were first rate producers, rappers, and lyricists, as each song possesses an infectious groove and a catchy beat. &#34;Straight Outta Compton,&#34; the opening track, can be seen as Rap's &#34;Welcome to the Jungle,&#34; while &#34;F.ck the Police&#34; sticks it to the man like no other. &#34;Gangsta Gangsta,&#34; probably the album's most memorable song, is lyrically one of Ice Cube's most authentically bad-ass moments. Elsewhere on the album, Dre's &#34;Express Yourself&#34; is probably the album's catchiest (and most radio-friendly) song, while Eazy-E's &#34;Eight Ball&#34; remains a rap classic. The rest of the album, while not quite as memorable, is still first rate.<br /><br />Going on twenty years as of this writing; &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; sounds as fresh and relevant today as it did upon its release. Even if rap isn't your thing, this album is well worth owning as it offers the best of the genre. If you buy only one rap album in your life &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; is the one to get.wn.

B000E97Y6K|3.0|Three stars. That's not too bad, right? Unless, you sit down to watch an \\"epic\\" with five-star expectations. Ultimately, \\"King Kong\\" is a letdown, not a bad movie by any means, but far from great.    Don't blame the leading man. Kong was a remarkable cinematic creation, a truly noble savage. The fault here lies with the filmmaker who got terribly sidetracked on Skull Island, \\"F/X'ing\\" us silly with dinosaurs, anaconda-sized earthworms and insects bigger than Buicks. Sounds cool enough, until you realize all that screen time devoted to some overly long \\"secondary\\" action sequences prevented us from getting to spend more time with Kong.    Oddly, the entrance of the giant ape was kind of a giant letdown, lacking true tension. In this three hour-plus \\"thrill ride,\\" there wasn't enough time taken to slow down and really develop much of a Kong mystic. Then, once he appears, not enough \\"down time\\" was made to -- and this may sound goofy -- develop his character. Peter Jackson had too many other monsters to cram onto the screen.    Furthermore, while I found Kong to be believable, I never was sold on Jack Black's portrayal of a devious, obsessive movie director. He seemed to be winking his way through the part, almost too comical to ever be taken seriously.    Kong was actually about the most convincing \\"actor\\" in the whole movie, but because Jackson got so carried away overpopulating Skull Island with other beasts, Kong was almost more of a supporting role rather than a lead. Plus, I can't help but be peeved that Jackson coped out in terms of that instant transition from the island back to New York. Seriously, how - with their relatively tiny ship busted up on the rocks - did our heroes transport the Big Ape to the Big Apple?     The climatic scene atop the Empire State building was remarkable, a great movie moment. Unfortunately, too much of the journey to that moment is little more than the stuff and fluff of what \\"King Kong\\" aspired to be more than, just another hyped-up F/X-packed popcorn movie.

B00011D1OA|5.0|<br />Fifty years ago this week, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's incomparable MY FAIR LADY opened on Broadway-and ran for several years.  When producer Jack L. Warner personally produced a movie version, he did almost everything right-the whole show at 173 minutes (including roadshow intermission and music ends), in proscenium arch Super Panavision 70, with Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway repeating their stage roles.  And he brought in a director he had worked with before (A STAR IS BORN in 1954) and who was renowned for elegant sophistication, George Cukor.  But Warner may have made a big mistake in not casting the Broadway Eliza Doolittle, Julie Andrews, for the movie, going instead with young Audrey Hepburn.  Revenge was both bitter and sweet-the movie got twelve Oscar nominations but none for Hepburn as Actress, while Andrews (in her film debut) won the Actress Oscar...for MARY POPPINS.  Adding insult to insult, Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon in one of the worst-kept secrets in 1963 Hollywood as the movie was being filmed at Warner Bros.  And Jeremy Brett's towering \\"On the Street Where You Live\\", one of the greatest songs in musical theater history, was also dubbed--in a very well kept secret, not revealed until a 1994 documentary.  Now why, pray tell, does one cast actors in a musical whose song voices will have to be dubbed?  Actually, Hepburn and Brett are wonderful as Eliza and Freddy in the movie.  And Andrews has her Oscar as ample compensation.  Maybe she would have won an Oscar for MY FAIR LADY.  We will never know. <br /> <br />I am reviewing the 40th anniversary restoration of MY FAIR LADY on letterboxed double disk DVD.  The box says \\"High definition transfer from the 1994 restoration picture and sound elements.\\"   Even with just stereo headphones and a 27\\" television in a bedroom, the movie looks and sounds better than it ever has.  The loverly songs seem to jump out at you, and the color is magnificent.  This was a mammoth restoration job by the great team of Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz, who initially had to deal with a negative that looked like crumpled and cracked bacon with no color left.  The preservation job they have done, documented on the lengthy and extensive 1994 documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett on disk two, deserves a Special Oscar. <br /> <br />Man, I love this movie!  I could watch it again tonight for four hours (including bonus material), just for the glorious songs and the witty story--Rex Harrison and Wilfred Hyde-White, Henry Higgins and Colonel Pickering, are phonetic experts who hire a young cockney flower girl, Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, to pose as a duchess.  That involves tons of dictation and phonics lessons.  Much of the dialogue is clearly taken directly from George Bernard Shaw's PYGMALION, filmed in 1938 with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.  Interestingly, both of these movies, three decades apart, where photographed by Harry Stradling.  As Eliza slowly becomes someone elegant and smart, we get some of the most beautiful songs in the American musical theatre, including  \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\\" \\"I'm an Ordinary Man,\\" \\"The Rain in Spain,\\" and especially the soaring \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\", my personal favorite song in the whole show.  Meanwhile, back in Covent Garden, Eliza's father Alfie (Oscar nominee Stanley Holloway) tears up the wide screen with \\"A Little Bit of Luck\\". The renovated and regally dressed new Eliza is a hit at the Ascot races, until something very funny happens. <br /> <br />Jeremy Brett, or a song double, gets to do my other favorite song in the show, \\"On the Street Where You Live\\", on both sides of the theatrical intermission and Embassy Waltz.  Let's talk about Oscar-winning sets by Gene Allen and costumes by Cecil Beaton (who egotistically once tried to take credit for the sets also).  We spend a lot of time in a Wimple Street flat with a lot of book shelves and ladders from floor to two story ceiling.  Cukor (or choreographer Hermes Pan) seems to know where to put three or five people at one time to make a static setting interesting.  The Ascot races are all white and black and gray, very elegant and striking; Beaton's costumes are magnificent.  And Allen's designs for Higgins' mother's (Gladys Cooper) apartment are so stylish--all white, with plants upstage, Eliza in a pink dress, and Higgins in a gray suit. <br /> <br />Part two of MY FAIR LADY is only about 75 minutes, but manages to have reprises of \\"Just You Wait\\", \\"On the Street Where You Live,\\" \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\" in a pre-dawn Covent Garden, the new \\"Show Me\\" by Eliza/Marni Nixon, and Holloway's show-stopping \\"Get Me to the Church on Time\\".  We end with Eliza choosing Higgins over Freddy (watch for key dialogue in mom's apartment with Higgins and Eliza revealing honest feelings) and Higgins' poignant soliloquy \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\\" on the same Wimpole Street set where Freddy does \\"On the Street Where You Live\\".  It is a satisfying ending to a fabulous show, filmed to perfection by an army of pros on both sides of the camera. <br /> <br />And do spend some time with the disk two bonuses on the letterboxed 2004 double disk. My only complaint is that the informative 1994 documentary has the movie clips in squeezed or pan/scan format and not wide-screen.  It is a bit ludicrous to have restorers Harris and Katz talk about \\"restoring a lady\\" if we cannot see that \\"lady\\" in her Super Panavision glory.  But that's a minor flaw in a very good documentary.  It is chilling to think we almost lost MY FAIR LADY to the ravages of time.  Fortunately, the movie itself is at the correct 2.20 wide-screen ratio, so watch this hour documentary before viewing the incomparable restored film.  You may even want to put on the English subtitles command so that you can sing along to some of the loveliest songs ever. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001AP12G|4.0|I have lots of respect for Kanye West.  In high school, he got the superlative for \\"Lest Likely To Succeed\\", then he dropped out of college, then he started out as a small-time record producer for Roc-A-Fella, and just look at him now.  That's real inspiration to me. <br /> <br />I got \\"The College Dropout\\" when it first came out, and it hadn't left my car for a very long time (I still listen to it on occasion).  The production is hot as hell, Kanye's got something to say on almost every single track, and there are real good guest appearances as well. <br /> <br />Notice how I said he had something to say on *almost* every track.  Yes, there are a few filler tracks on here, such as \\"The New Workout Plan\\" and others, which - in my opinion - prevent \\"The College Dropout\\" from being a classic rap album. <br /> <br />Overall, most of the CD is good and worth the money.  Add it to your collection if you haven't yet.
B000001FI7|5.0|A classic trip hop album needs noirish ambience, haunting vocals and dark, dense production. Portishead's Dummy is so classic and so faithful to the trip hop genre that it has become the unofficial blueprint.<br /><br />Beth Gibbons is the moody songstress that this album - or any album for that matter - needs. She wails with a kind of grace and vindiction that is so crucial to the band's sound. She's like the Nina Simone of trip hop - untouchable, remarkable and passionate.<br /><br />The production is flawless in both its listenability and its command of the album's mood. The orchestral feel of the strings and basslines makes it a densely layered listen and leaves you exploring each track many times over. That's perhaps what I love the most about this album: the beautiful vocals and rich production leaves you wanting to revisit each track over and over again, each time leaving you with a new or different impression and/or understanding of Portishead's sound.<br /><br />If you're a big Morcheeba or Massive Attack fan then you NEED this album. The early 90s trip hop scene in England was the british equivalent to Americain grunge, complete with self indulgence, decadence and darkness. The vocals are always a total treat and the production is always deep and interesting. If you're a big earphone-fiend and love to escape into your music during the morning and evening commute then Portishead is your friend. With a great voice in Beth Gibbons and beats that are both jaw-dropping and mood-setting what more could a music lover ask for?

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I bought Genius Loves Company after I saw the movie 'Ray' and had the pleasure of being able to picture him as I heard him sing with Bonnie Raitt. Their recording was premier on the CD but I am very partial to Bonnie and her excellent slide guitar work. Van Morrison put aside his tendency to be stern and his scat work was good. James Taylor, the southern man, enjoyed his performance. I could hear it.  <br /> <br />I've known and loved Ray Charles' music since he formed the Raylettes and crossed over into mainstream music when I was about fifteen. I've enjoyed each song he's recorded, bought many '45s, LPs and CDs, have my favourites and it wasn't until the 1980s that I discovered the double LP of his earliest years dating back to 1949. I bought the CD as soon as it became available.  <br /> <br />There wasn't a song I was unhappy with on \\"Genius\\". I am not an expert on arrangement, orchestration or other technical bumpf, but I am knowledgeable regarding good sound. It sounded excellent to me and I didn't catch his tiredness. I especially enjoyed Somewhere Over The Rainbow with Johnny Mathis and You Don't know me with Norah Jones. Johnny Mathis and Ray singing together took me back to my teens and I will be sixty this year. I can imagine the fun he had recording those cuts. <br /> <br />That is what I got from this final recording. Fun. Ray's incredible capacity for fun throughout his life and struggles was one of the facets of his great persona that he has left with us.  <br /> <br />He didn't have a disability when he sat at his piano and began to sing. I saw him in an outdoor concert venue once and wept with love and sheer delight. That is feeling I had when I bought his final recording. He is one in a million and as long as we have this technology we will have The Genius with us.

B000A7DVRC|4.0|Personally I love The Big Lebowski. It's just hilarious and off the wall. I laugh the whole movie. The Big Lebowski isn't everyone's favorite so try catching it on comedy central first, if your not sure you want to buy it. In regards to this specific Collector's Edition copy it's not that great. There is a Coen Brothers interview, still images, and an introduction as the special features. In my opinion I don't think they gave The Big Lebowski Collector's Edition the treatment it deserved.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a great series...not one to think too hard about.  Nice to watch without all of the commercials!
B00062ZE3U|5.0|i have to admit that Within Temptation doesn't liked me a lot from their begginnig. It was like other goths bands: I mean, the girl with the exelent voice, and the guy who yells most of the time. <br /> <br />Since Mother Earth, i think that they took the best choice possible. They decided to be Sharon's voice the only one leadering this band, and i think their accuracy was really great.  <br /> <br />The Silent Force is the best album ever made by a true goth band. When i say TRUE, i mean that their lyrics are really gothic, and they don't need to always wear black clothes, or have cruzes on their necks: they're 100% gothics. <br /> <br />Sharon's voice is incredible. She always sounds great (even at live). The music is kinda church-style, who really give sense for the definition of what goth is. <br /> <br />Is an exelent album, and no one must refuse it, because i think one will never find an album as well produce and written as this. <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This movie should have walked away with everything possible from the Acadamy Awards. It not only was the best movie of the year but it was the best of all things comsidering. I am very fortunate to have seen the best movie made for this year with hope and expectations for the theme and motive to remain forever.
1592401791|5.0|If you've ever wondered what REALLY went on behind the scenes at Beatles recording sessions, this is the book to get.  Geoff Emerick was there at the beginning, and he was with the Fab Four all the way through to the end, an eyewitness -- and collaborator -- to the way they shaped and remolded modern music.  This book isn't just about the way the records were made -- it's about the people too, and Emerick's keen insights into the personalities of the four bandmembers provides a new perspective, making for a fascinating look back at an amazing, and important, era.  I couldn't put this book down from start to finish -- it's a fast, breezy read, and the subject matter is engrossing.  Kudos to Emerick, and may he inspire many more young people to follow in his footsteps.
0345440900|5.0|I love this book, She has a lot of common sense and helps you see things in a way you might not otherwise.  I'm so glad I read this BEFORE the baby came and I know we've avoided some disasters by forming good habits right away - I wouldn't have thought to try and prevent many of them.  She also shows you how to fix bad habits after they're well established.  A great book for the parent of a newborn - 1st time or otherwise.
B000929AJQ|5.0|It is difficult to make a review for this album, as there is absolutely no way to please everyone on the issue of this very pivotal record in Nine Inch Nail's career. For many, the old Nine Inch Nails had been abandoned on this record, as Reznor moved into sobriety and stripped himself of all those around him who were associated with his troubled past, including his live band, his manager, and even his old style of writing music. However, some newer fans made by the album and more flexible older fans can see the new direction Reznor is moving in, and are enjoying it. <br /> <br />However, despite the fact that this new batch of songs is a departure from the way Reznor used to work in the past, that doesn't mean that the songs are bad at all. Stripping himself of a fog of keyboards to drown each song in distortion like on The Downward Spiral and layer the music with soundscapes such as on The Fragile, Reznor relies more on a guitar/bass/loops/live drum sound on this album, with keyboards added more as an afterthought, as well as a wonderful atmospheric background to each track. Great examples of the new use of keyboards can be witnessed on The Hand That Feeds, You Know What You Are?, All The Love In The World, Love Is Not Enough, The Collector, Only, Sunspots, Getting Smaller, Every Day Is Exactly The Same, and the title track. However, some of the songs still have keyboards as the main source of sound, including The Line Begins To Blur, Beside You In Time, and Right Where It Belongs. <br /> <br />All of the songs are extremely good, but they aren't the old Nine Inch Nails, for sure. However, Reznor's new style is truly amazing, as he takes a more direct approach to his music; his new band is a perfect example of a more direct band. Along with some of his older, more atmospheric tracks, shown on The Fragile and The Downward Spiral, the tracks off of With_Teeth, Broken, and Pretty Hate Machine contrast wonderfully live, and the sparks fly. The new tracks fit well intothe show, and make you appreciate the album even more. <br /> <br />So, even though the new album may not be Nine Inch Nails as we knew it, one thing's for sure: Reznor can still pack a punch, and hasn't succumbed to becoming an act who only churns out what his fans expect: instead, he tests his fans with each release, from the fury of The Downward Spiral to the double-album epic approach on The Fragile to this new stripped down NIN. <br /> <br />If you truly appreciate Reznor's style, and the way he tests his audience, you should enjoy the new album for what it is, celebrate the new Nine Inch Nails, and look forward to what Trent Reznor has in store next.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|First, I must say, this album BLEW ME AWAY even upon my first listen. From the first to the tenth song, \\"Funeral\\" never losses its powerful, emotional sound. I am extremely surprised that this album doesn't have a 4-1/2 or 5 star rating because it deserves it! <br /> <br />Best songs include: \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\", \\"Neighborhood #1\\", \\"In the Backseat\\" and \\"Neighborhood #2\\" though all songs are fantastic! <br /> <br />If you're wondering what they sound like, they're a mix between Franz Ferdinand and Interpol (but better).
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a well-written, beautifully acted, perfectly directed masterpiece.  I have rarely been so moved by a movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a film that completely absorbs you and makes your heart ache for the characters.
0307263118|5.0|I don't know how some critics have come to the conclusion that \\"The Sea\\" is either stilted, pompous or too wordy. It is as lucid as the sea Banville evokes. And surely, if you can construct (as Banville does here) the mists of memory in a manner that is so true to the actual experience of living and remembering, then surely you've achieved something great. There's no easy plot line here, sure, but I can't imagine a better way to explore the workings of a mind as it constructs a sense of self around objects, places and desires that can only be recalled by a tempered awareness (like a recovering drunk's sense of orientation to the evening before). Banville goes beyond facile attempts in fiction to give reality a sequential appearance. The Sea captures, through Max's reflections over the span of a life-time, experience lived imaginatively as one might do objectively. A great read.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Sorry to use a non film comparison but The Wicker Man is the cinematic version of Brueghel's painting \\"Carnival Versus Lent\\".  The Christian reviewers seeing this film as indicting Paganism misunderstand it in the same way various modern Pagans have thought of The Wicker Man as a celebration of Paganism.  In reality, it takes an existentialist approach showing the hypocricy of all beliefs and I would hardly call that dated. Not just the music (haunting English ballads with bawdy themes) but all the imagery is so evocative that each viewing brings up more intuition. Just as significant as The Seventh Seal but a hell of a lot more entertaining and a lot less pretentious. Its too bad that the only way to get the extended version of dvd is in the special edition box. Either way, make sure to see the extended version which is the way the movie was meant to be seen.
B00005JOE8|5.0|While those who previously enjoyed the graphic novel and approached the movie through that lens may have been disappointed, I can only say that after seeing V for Vendetta I was powerfully moved, intrigued and beguiled into the intracacies of this well told tale in a cinematic format. So much so, I might add, that I am taking my wife to it again at a cinerama.  The story is tight, the visuals are stunning and atmospherics are ever present. I have no quibbles with how things unfolded and left the theatre wanting to cheer.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The purpose of this review is similar to the one by Nick from Louisville, KY; I don't understand how this album has an average rating of 4.5 stars while it is clearly one of the most essential recordings in modern music history (hence, deserving 5 starts, at least). This has nothing to do with \\"people having differing opinions...\\" as some reviewers complained but rather with its essential place in music history. No person with musical maturity can rate \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Nevermind\\" low - whether he/she likes the respective album or not. There are records that define an era of music and affect the future of music itself. OK Computer is one of those. <br /> <br />What can I write about this album that hasn't been said already? Virtually nothing, so I just sum up what others have said :-) before adding my own two cents:  <br /> <br />OK Computer hit the music landscape by storm. It met with wide critical acclaim and commercial success, making Radiohead one of the most significant bands of the late 90's. OK Comp. won a Grammy award in 1998 (best alternative music performance) - although that doesn't necessarily indicate good music when you look at past Grammy winners. Anyhow, several magazines, other media outlets, music professionals, and fans have ranked it consistently among the top records. For instance, the readers of Q Magazine (the best music magazine in the world, I may note) ranked it in 1998 as the best record of all time (The Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" (1966), R.E.M.'s \\"Automatic For The People\\" (1992), The Stone Roses', \\"The Stone Roses\\" (1989), and Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" (1991) completing the top 5). In 2006, OK Computer gained the #1 spot again (followed by \\"The Bends\\" at #2).  <br />The Guardian (in 2003), VH1 (in 2005), Rolling Stone magazine (in 2003), Spin Magazine (in 2005), Channel 4 (UK TV channel; in 2005),.... ranked it consistently among the best records of all time.  <br />This indicates that, almost 10 years after its release, OK can be legitimately labeled an \\"essential classic.\\" The album can be seen as important as The Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side,\\" Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" and other all time classics. All these records should have 6 star ratings.  <br /> <br />My personal view is not much different. Listening to this record today, it seems definitely timeless and, in an awkward way, \\"fulfilling\\" and \\"peaceful.\\" OK Comp. is a progressive rock-electronic masterpiece that was (and probably still is) ahead if its time; it sounds \\"conceptual\\" by giving the listener a glimpse of what the future of rock may look like (since then (1997), \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" may have taken us further down that road).  <br />It takes some time to get into OK Comp. but the patient listener will be rewarded. Songs like \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" initially seem like inaccessible outlined \\"world-weariness.\\" With all the instrumental \\"extras\\" and layers, you may feel overwhelmed and are contemplating whether you should eject the disc from the CD player and throw it out of the window. If you, however, let the CD in the player and work yourself through the more accessible tracks (e.g., \\"Let Down\\" and \\"Karma Police\\"), there is no holding back; the album grabs you by the neck and you drift away. Extensive drums (\\"Climbing up the Walls\\"), abused stringed instruments, crying guitars, and electronic effects guide you into a valley of pain (e.g., \\"Electioneering\\") and pleasure (e.g., the chanson-hymn like \\"No Surprises\\"). At the end, \\"the Tourist\\" takes you back where you left earth, with a smile on your face. Then, you understand the beauty of this album - and appreciate the importance and significance of \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien.\\" In fact, they may become your favorite songs - although it is difficult to actually have a favorite on this record. Most of the songs either build on each other or are integrated in another way (either musically or lyrically). Hence, the album is greater as the sum of its parts. Listening to \\"No Surprises\\" or \\"Paranoid Android\\" on their own is a thrill but listening to them in the context of the other songs is even better. This is why I think it is almost impossible to analyze and/or rate each song separately. <br /> <br />After almost 10 years, this record still grasps me by the neck and takes me away. As with good wine, each song needs room to \\"breathe\\" and develop. As with good wine, this album gets only better as time passes - as the songs have more room to grow and show their brilliance.
0743265289|5.0|I agree that the questions in this book are harder than average. It's quite useful understanding all of the questions and solutions in this book if you need a good score (700+). If you aim for 600 then Princeton review or something equivalent might be sufficient for you.    I took the test 5 years ago and got 600 (75th) so I knew what I was up against and had done all the OG 10th edition questions before. This time around my goal was 90th+ percentile (690), but I had very little time to practise, about a month and max 10 hours pr week, as I was busy studying Mandarin at an intensive program in Beijing. My strategy for achieving the score I needed:    - Study with the hardest questions.   - Understand why you fail. Do the questions that you got wrong again in the following week to make sure you know why you did them wrong and how to do them right.  - Try to find more than one methodology to solve each question. After each practise-test, go through all the exercises again, this time with no time-limit. The purpose is to find better methods of solving the q's you got right, to understand why you got some wrong and how best to solve these questions. You especially need to focus on remembering the correct/smartest methodology (perhaps do a couple of questions of each type), but I'd say it's best having a repertoaire of 3 or more methods for each type of question.  - Multiple choice is a game of odds, so you need to perfect your techniques for guessing in case you get questions you cannot solve easily and quickly, or if get stuck. 1) Use POE/process of elimination (I did it on a piece of paper during the test - very useful), especially on CR and SC. 2) Plug in on PS questions where it can save you time. These two methods definitly helped me increase my score.  - Practicalities: Check out the center before test-day to reduce stress come test-day. On the test day: take the breaks and try to clear your mind before commencing the next part.    My practise test results (afterI had done all the exercises in the Kaplan 800):    - Princeton 1: 670 Q43 V40 (a year and a half before the test)   - Kaplan Diagnostic: 650 (2 weeks before the test)   - Kaplan 1: 550 Q33 V31 (1 week before the test)   - Kaplan 2: 570 Q31 V36 (1 week before the test)   - Powerprep 1: 680 Q46 V38 (1 week before the test)   - Kaplan 3: 560 Q32 V35 (5 days before the test)   - Kaplan 4: 550 Q32 V33 (3 days before the test)   - Princeton 2: 640 Q34 V44 (3 days before the test)    Notice that my scores were not improving. I got 710 on the test, perhaps I was lucky given that my practise test results were not on that level. But I still think it should be possible getting 750 with more practise. Overall I'd say I couldn't have gotten the score I got without using the Kaplan 800 or a similar tool, not sure whether other alternatives exist on this level of difficulty though.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Very good story. Excellent acting. Clive Owen and Natalie POrtman deserved the golden globe awards.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Lets face it.... \\"Lucky Jack\\", the captain of the English frigate, \\"Surprise\\", has bitten off a tad more than he can chew.  He's after a French Ship-of-the-Line with bigger guns, MORE guns and a seeminly unbreachable hull. Oh yes... and the French ship, \\"Asheron\\", is faster than him as well.  But Jack's orders read to \\"sink her, burn her, of take her a prise\\" else Napolean will have a powerful ship wreacking havoc in tha Pacific, \\"possibly tipping the balance of the war in Napolean's favor\\".  Good grief!!!!  What else could you ask for in a movie!!! And widescreen to-boot!!! A fabulous show where the \\"weather gage\\" and the \\"weather gods\\" mean everything. A must see for those who love the old \\"square-rigger\\" days.
B00005JO1S|5.0|Like Joe Dante, who directed the 1985 sci-fi flick \\"Explorers,\\" John Favreau understands exactly what it is about sci-fi that tickles the imaginations of kids. Both directors ground their adventures in the familiar setting of home -- a neighborhood, a house -- and both directors show a talent for remembering what it's like to be a kid in awe, presenting everything from the point of view of the boys as they stumble through unlikely space adventures. <br /> <br />This movie is perfectly paced, the kids play their parts with convincing emotion and the dialogue is often hilarious. Zathura is a movie about a magical board game that brings aliens and space ships to life, but it's also about siblings pulling together and discovering their love for each other even if they don't always get along.  <br /> <br />There are very funny moments here, like one scene that plays on the absurdity of an astronaut who lands on a house floating in space and still offers the courtesy of ringing the doorbell. The comedic timing is absolutely perfect. But there are also warm scenes, showing what another reviewer described as \\"a movie with a heart,\\" which is a great way to put it. <br /> <br />Favreau makes it just as easy for adults to feel the same thrill at the prospect of a space adventure as the younger audience. And like Joe Dante, who paid homage to the sci-fi classics of the 50s with \\"Explorers,\\" Favreau gives those films a nod visually with the retro ships of the alien villians and a malicious robot that's straight out of early comic books. <br /> <br />This was a great release for the Christmas season and I could see it becoming a seasonal classic for families. I caught this movie with my brother -- we're both in our 20s -- and my mom during a week when my brother was on a rare leave from an overseas military station, and it was a great way to spend a family afternoon. It's safe to say that if you have young kids, they'll love it too.
B000E5N62U|5.0|\\"This is my death album [...] it's about the death of culture, the death of politics, the beginning of the end of my life.'' -Donald Fagen (New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 2006)    Fagen spent an entire year working on \\"Morph the Cat\\" and you can really tell! The production on \\"Morph the Cat\\" is flawless, perfect, a thing of beauty; I've heard no better ever (I have roughly 2,000 compact discs and 30,000 MP3s) although you would certainly expect this from a man like Donald Fagen who can hear differences in the 1/10 of a decibel range (see; New York Times article cited above). Couple his absolute impeccable ear with the current technology and you get \\"Morph the Cat,\\" what I find to be the best produced studio album ever, even when measured against the entire Steely Dan, Donald Fagen, and Walter Becker catalogs, respectively. That aside...    Fagen, a known recluse has warmed up in recent years, occasionally touring (e.g. he is currently on his very first solo tour in support of \\"Morph\\"), giving an unprecedented number of interviews and surprisingly even subtle interpretations of the lyrical content contained within \\"Morph\\" (when asked in the past about his lyrics he often scoffed at the idea of providing interpretations).      The title track bookends the album, first introducing the listener to a feline named Morph who flies around Manhattan (I imagine the Chesire Cat from Alice in Wonderland) seemingly spreading good cheer. The album ends however on a completely different note (figuratively of course), when Morph seems then to reflect a menacing gaze (consistent with surveillance), a thematic panopticon of sorts (a panopticon is an architectural device initially used as a disciplinary mechanism in prisons but with modern surveillance technologies like the video camera has become an increasingly common component in our post 9-11 society - surveillance and 9/11 are both themes consistent throughout \\"Morph the Cat\\"). The theoretical premise of the panopticon of course concerns the idea that one can never discern whether they are being watched thus causing the survielled to self police themselves (see; Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish).     \\"The cat is narcotizing the citizens [...] I observe it in people, this mind-death, these layers of brain-washing that's gone on for so many years. It's in the techniques of political machines, the unbelievable stupidity on television\\" -Donald Fagen (New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 2006).    \\"H Gang\\" is about an eccentric old band, the \\"life and death of a band in a nutshell,\\" Mr. Fagen writes in the album liner notes.     \\"What I Do\\" concerns an imaginarily conversation of a younger Mr. Fagen with the legendary Ray Charles. Here Mr. Fagen expresses his thoughts concerning his insecurities (hard to believe I know). Regarding the songs content, Mr. Fagen recently remarked, \\"I think I didn't accept myself as a performer until very recently. I always thought I had this sort of fake job\\" (WB/Reprise Records Press Release 2006).    \\"Brite Nitegown\\" is a song generally about death and dying. The fellow in the \\"brite nightgown\\" is none other than the Grim Reaper himself!     ''The Great Pagoda of Funn'' is seemingly about two lovers who remain together in an effort to shelter themselves from the horrors of the contemporary world. Mr. Fagen remarked that he, ''wrote that after several beheadings in Iraq, you can thank Mr. Zarqawi for that song'' (New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 2006).    \\"Security Joan\\" is playful song where a man falls for a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) guard at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The underlying tone of the song pokes fun at the ridiculousness of airport security.      \\"The Nite Belongs to Mona\\" contains the albums only direct reference to the Trade Towers in the line, \\"Was it the fire downtown/ that turned her world around?'' However the 9-11 attacks remain a theme consistent throughout the duration of the album.     \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" is perhaps the most telling account of the tactics espoused by the current administration, what Mr. Fagen subtly likens to a \\"thuggish cult\\" (\\"Morph the Cat\\" liner notes 2006).       Overall this album is a real gem, surely not to disappoint! Do yourself a favor and purchase this album right away! I highly recommend this album as it is somewhat of a rarity (especially these days with the garbage that the music industry churns out) as it can be enjoyed on a variety of different levels by those of all ages, musicianship, intellectual capacity, etc.     The album is very pop oriented and \\"music friendly\\" (this DOES NOT imply elevator music) and the lyrical content for the most part is so subtle that you won't have to worry about your child, spouse, partner, pet, etc., becoming frightened to death! The production is so damn perfect that even the novice musical ear will take notice.     The album is perfect as either background music or for serious listening on both a musical level and/or lyrical level (I prefer the latter -this is the most stimulating album I've heard in years aside from Brian Wilson's SMiLE (2004). There is certainly a variety of ways to consume the music contained on \\"Morph the Cat\\" most albums (contemporary or otherwise), fail to ever achieve such a goal!     [NOTE: Later this year Reprise Records plans to release a three disc box set probably containing remixed versions of Donald Fagen's first two solo works, \\"The Nightfly\\" (1982) and \\"Kamakiriad\\" (1993), as well as his current release \\"Morph the Cat\\" (2006)]
0060976624|5.0|A friend's parents brought me this book when I was down for the count with some serious health issues.  The book is hilarious and fast-paced, and while it doesn't spend too much time delving into the minutiae of the lobbying industry (perhaps if it were written today), the reader does get a satirical look at how the wheels in Washington get greased.  Everyone who borrowed the copy of this book that I had loved it as well.  I'm thrilled that it's been made into a movie and that this book (and author Chris Buckley) will finally get the recognition that probably wasn't there when the book was first published.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B000003TAL|5.0|this has quite an influence on the modern sound.....made in 88', is there much to say about that?.. .....the concept of it has a futuristic sci-fi cyber-punk vision, kinda like William Gibson's Neuromancer, making it the ultimate album of Anarchy..but there's much more to it....Sonic Youth really made it they're own style and created their own vision, and collided the fast complex drum, with experimental,rioting guitars of Thurston and Lee, along with Kim Gordon's melodic bass, and appealing vocals...Steve Shelley with manic-fast drums, switching time signatures, and consistent pace <br />such highlights as Teenage Riot, The Sprawl, which is the name of Gibson's trilogy..Elimination Jr., Hey Joni...and of course the entire album is crafted as a collage of chaotic Dissonance, dreamy, moody emotion that split the face of the surface....into a trance of sonic sound..... <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN should have won all eight Academy awards that it was nominated for - it was by far the most well scripted, well acted and innovative Film of 2005.   There are some \\"reviews\\" listed here that are offensive, and of course those are probably written by the same people who would think a great film example would be \\"Momma's Big House II\\" or \\"Yours Mine and Ours\\"--not to insinuate that there is anything wrong with light hearted films of that genre - but the point is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN tackles a delicate subject in a way that has NEVER been dipicted before.    Many movie-goers tend to think of gay characters as funny, frivolous, silly and ridiculous. To a certain degree this is the way gay characters have been portrayed on the silver screen and on our TV screens as well.  Even very entertaining tv sitcoms such as WILL AND GRACE are actually at times unintentionally reinforcing Society's overview of negative stereotypical behavior - see the funny gay next door neighbor, isn't he cute, isn't he fun to be around ~ we don't have to take him seriously. Then, flip over to another station to watch QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY - hey look, look at these gay guys, aren't they funny, aren't they cute, they sure know how to decorate - they sure do know about fashion - they are \\"harmless\\" enough, we don't have to take them seriously. Along comes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.....hey wait a minute!  These guys seem just like two regular guys....they aren't funny ~ they don't seem to know about fashion....they have real feelings for each other and have genuine love for each other which they can't express openly due to the confines of Society's borders - what is \\"this\\" all about?  Well, it's about a movie that is so magnificent, so well written, so incredibly superior to the average JUNK fare that is being churned out that it is beyond the scope of understanding of the average movie-goer.   If you want to see a standard, done-to-death, here we go again movie by all means go see \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" or \\"Momma's Big House\\" or \\"Yours Mine and Ours\\".    If you want to view a cinematic masterpiece you should vist BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Fagen is unique and very talented. His work (both music and lyrics) is dense, off-kilter, often oblique. Since Katy Lied, I've found that it seldom reveals its magic on the first or second listen. Morph the Cat is no different; the more I listen to it, its charms come into sharper focus. For all the pleasure Don has given us over the years, I think we owe it to him to refrain from making snap judgments on his efforts. And we owe it to ourselves to let the music make its case over time. Keep listening... maybe not every day, but semi-regularly and without an agenda. I promise you it will be worth your while. Keep 'em coming, Don.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions from madonna is a great great album and one of the year's best. I find it very satiating. Gargantuanly recommended!!!
B00000JJQK|2.0|Ive noticed that if you read the reviews for Sgt Pepper and Pet Sounds nearly every PS review references the Beatles or Pepper somehow.Mostly to say how much better PS is and this to me signifies the massive inferiority complex fans of this album have when it's compared to Pepper,or Rubber Soul etc.Almost none of the reviews for Pepper reference PS,Beatles fans are comfortable with the knowledge that the Beatles are superior and have no need to worry about PS,just their love for the wonderful Pepper. Having said that PS has two great songs,one is one of my all time favorites from any band,God Only Knows,simply beautiful.The other the great teen love anthem,Wouldn't It Be Nice.  <br />The rest is simply fluff and can't be taken seriously by anyone.If the whole album rivalled God Only Knows THEN you would have an album that rivals Pepper and one that could be called one of the best ever. <br />It seems to me also that people from the states are grasping at straws trying to find something that can rival the Beatles,Stones etc and have elevated this rather sweet album way above it's merits. <br />Also when talking about influence remember Brian Wilson was hugely influenced by Rubber Soul,so no Rubber Soul no PS,so thank the Beatles for PS! <br />And lastly remember Brian went nuts after he heard Pepper,knowing there was no way he could possibly better it,so who would know better how great Pepper really was?

B000E41MS6|5.0|I agree, the new series is a SMASH HIT!  Anyone who gives this 2 stars is just ignorant.  True fans remember the many years that the show was off the air, and are thrilled that it is finally back, especially in the United States. With all the money the BBC put into this series it truly shines with superior visual effects and a phenomenal story line.  Christopher Eccleston is wonderful as the new Doctor, and Ms. Billie Piper is great as his companion Rose.  I love the new interior of the TARDIS, and I am very excited that the show is back after all of this time...  I can't wait to get this on DVD!
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I'm not here to say this is comparable with classic thrash albums, because if that's what you're looking for, don't buy this. What I'm here to say is that anything this new that is played on the radio and has a solo (a solo!) has to be at least 3 stars.<br /><br />This album is mostly good because of the first five songs. After Trashed and Scattered, the songs aren't really any different, but that's the problem. If this was a five song EP it might rank up there with my favorite albums, but the fact is, this cd is way too lengthy, as are most of the songs. As I just said, the first five are great, but after that, all these solos and riffs sound the same. Pretty soon, you just want Matt Shadows to shut up, quit singing in that annoying voice of his (it will get annoying, trust me). Most of these songs range from five to seven minutes long, and there's no reason. They repeat the chorus a few million times in each song, solo the whole time (usually a good thing but not here), and there just isn't any point after the first 3 minutes.<br /><br />However, as I have already stated twice, the first 5 are great. They are all 4-5 star songs. Throw in The Wicked End and maybe MIA and you have a decent album. These 6 or 7 songs save the album from a 1 star rating. They ARE the album.<br /><br />What isn't cool about some of these reviews is how they completely trash the guitars. Yes, annoying after a while, but these guys have skills, even if they aren't using them to make the greatest music. It's hard to say if this album is worth your money. I haven't heard anything from either of their other albums, apart from Unholy Confessions, which reminded me of The Offspring. From what I've heard, this is the worst of the 3, so maybe download the songs mentioned above, but don't buy the album.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Everything is Illuminated is essentially split into two parts: the comedy and the drama, and both are equally satisfying.  The first part contains a clash of cultures, and the development of some seriously interesting and oddball characters.  The narrator (Eugene Hutz) is Alex, Jonathan Safron Foer's (Elijah Wood) guide through the Ukraine to find Augustina, a woman who had saved Foer's grandfather from Nazi's.  Foer's character is extremely eccentric, collecting everything from false teeth to pictures to dirt (he is reffered a few times as \\"The Collecter\\").  He travels to Ukraine and enlists the help of a company that helps people find some element of their past in Ukraine.  From the moment we meet Alex and his wildly vulgar grandfather (who has a big part in the second half), we know that these characters are one of a kind.  Alex picks Jonathan up at a train station, and from then on, Jonathan is known to Alex as JonFan.  \\"My name is Jonathan.\\"  \\"Yes, JonFan.\\"  Alex is extremely odd.  He aspires to be the equivalent of an American \\"Player\\" and he dresses in everything hip-hop.  The grandfather is also very odd.  He believes himself to be blind, even though that is not the case, and he travels with a female dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., or as she is known, his \\"seeing eye b*tch.\\"  There odyssey across Ukraine takes them to remote locations, but it isn't so much the trip that is interesting, as the clash of cultures.  There are a few instances where they don't quite understand each other.  For instance, they stop at a crude restaurant to eat, and Foer explains that he is a vegetarian, and that he doesn't eat meat.  No one in the entire room knows why, and the grandfather, as well as the owner of the establishment, asks \\"What is wrong with him?\\"  The language barrier is also an issue, and counts for many laughs during their journey.  Alex often uses odd ways of phrasing things, like \\"Did you catch some repose\\" for \\"Did you sleep\\" and \\"Do you participate in carnage with American women\\" instead of \\"Do you have sex.\\"  The second half of the film takes a very serious twist, and, while I won't give anything away, it is filled with heartwarming moments that unite these two cultures.  The performances in the film are wonderfully original and eccentric.  The film is a wonderful adaptation of Foer's novel, while it does leave things out, and Liev Schrieber delivers a great directorial debut.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|Final Fantasy VII was hailed as a masterpiece when it was released for Playstation oh-so many years ago.  The game had a peculiar kind of charm: from the malformed character models, to the cinematic flair it had (which was pretty new to games back then), striking characters, and an intelligent, interesting plot.   <br /> <br />I'm sure most fans didn't want a movie, but instead wanted a full-fleged sequel to FF VII that has all the charm that it had, but is still new and innovative.  Instead, we're given this so-so movie. <br /> <br />The movie is very esthetically pleasing, but beyond that, it doesn't offer much else.  The plot doesn't even seem to justify the movie, and all the charm of FF VII is mostly gone.  It's worth seeing if you're a big fan of 7, but other than that, it's pretty much a failure.   <br /> <br />Eye-wonderful graphics don't make a movie.  Nor do they make a good game, for that matter.  FF VII the game is proof enough of this.
B000077VR3|1.0|After having enjoyed Chicago so much, I thought there might be a coming wave of good musicals. Moulin Rouge is not on of them, though. It's not even in the same league as Chicago. The music is very offputting. Sadly, 90% or more is unoriginal.     Campy versions of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Roxanne\\" provide some entertainment, leading you to believe the whole thing is just harmless fun. Yet a seemingly never-ending overly bombastic version of Elton John's Your Song makes it clear that they are serious, and it just makes you cringe. (Note: EJ/BT wrote some of the best songs of the 20th century, but Your Song is *not* one of them.)    Sadly, the one song the show had going for it (Rufus Wainwright's \\"Complainte De La Butte\\") only gets heard for about 10 seconds during the introduction to the film. What a disappointment! Having the lyrics to that song fit into the plot could have added a whole extra dimension to the story and the visual aspect of the film. The steps up Montmartre lead through such a picturesque area of Paris. Very sad that they missed out on this opportunity.    The digitized view of Paris with the Eiffel Tower looks as cheesy as can be, but the interior and exterior shots of the Moulin Rouge itself are quite spectacular.    Nicole Kidman, what were you thinking? You are so abundantly talented as such films as To Die For attest. Then I see you in this and the pathetic remake of Stepford Wives and I have to wonder if you don't need a new agent.
1892005034|5.0|Then this is the book for you to read !!!        Most of us use language in an unconscious manner in an attempt to get our needs met. We repeat the same things our parents said, we continue to fail to get what we want from others and can't understand why. Dr. Rosenberg has studied human behavior quite thoroughly and figured out why we lose our compassionate nature and end up resorting to violence when we don't get what we want from life. These are not just ivory tower theories of an academic, these communication skills have been tried out the world over in the most difficult of situations involving war, anger, hatred and violence. This book is well worth reading, highly recommended!Also: visit cnvc.org for more info

B00005JMAH|4.0|I used to be the kind of person who thought Harry Potter was bad just because it had magic in it, but there were quite a few things that made me realize how dumb that was. <br /> <br />When I first saw \\"the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" I thought it was good, but it was definately darkler and more mysterious, which is how a series should run.  This one, though, is also confusing around the last 45 minutes to the last hour or so. <br /> <br />Harry runs away from the Dursleys early after Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge comes to visit and he loses his temper and blows her up into a balloon.  Then he runs off onto the Knight Bus where he hears of Sirius Black and later on learns that Black has escaped from Azkaban to come and kill him.  These things don't dwell on his mind a much after a dementor from Azkaban attacks him and allows him to hear his mother screaming on the night that Voldemort murdered his parents.  Then, after he is denied access to Hogsmeade (because Uncle Vernon didn't sign his permission form) and forced to sit through the first Divination lesson (Divination was a terrible addition to the series by the way as it was boring, though it serves for comic relief), he meets Buckbeak, Hagrid's hippogriff.  Later on, Malfoy is scratched by Buckbeak and Hagrid loses the defensitory case.  Buckneak is sentanced to death and Harry, Ron, and Hermione only think about this up until the time when Hermione puches Malfoy in the face.  After that, everything gets extremely confusing all through the time you meet Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew, down to the point when Sirius escapes, being an innocent man.  Then, the ending is basically Harry as he is leaving his third year when he recieves a Firebolt (the fastest racing broom to date) from Sirius (though only Harry, Ron, and Hermione know it) and dashes off into the sky. <br /> <br />There weren't very many additions to the series.  I mean, besides meeting two new characters and learning about who betrayed Harry's parents, theseries is basically the same edge-of-your-seat movie that I love to watch fifty times a day.  However, despite the fact that there isn't much new, \\"the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is a fabulous movie on the whole and definately one you want to buy. <br /> <br />The worst thing is the loss of Richard Harris who plays Dumbledore in the first two films.  Poor Richard died in 2002 and so he coudl not play Dumbledore in this movie.  While Sir Michael Gambdon is still a great Dumbledore, Richard Harris potrayed the softness and humor that Dumbledore manifested as well as the seriousness of Dumbledore when he needed it.  So, yeah, we all agree in my household, Richard Harris was better at it. <br /> <br />I definately think that if you buy any one Harry Potter movie, you need to buy all four of the Harry Potter movies.  We have them all, of course.  My mom even wants to collect all the music.  We're pathetci in our house when it comes to Harry Potter.  We have all six of the books and one of the video games.  Can you believe they're going to make us wait till 2007 for the next movie and the last book?  It's outrageous.
0743454537|4.0|I really enjoyed this book--the ending was not what I expected, but overall it was a good book.  I love the writer's style and the story.  The ending was good, just a surprise (and not what I hoped would happen!)
B00008DDXC|4.0|Of course, the first Harry Potter movie was a cinematic achievement, but the second one is a great movie.  The story begins with Harry's escape from the Dursleys' and ends with the restoration of everyone who was Petrified and Hagrid's release from Azkaban.  In between is the actual movie, of course. <br /> <br />\\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" is darker then the first movie, but that's what makes it good.  The series is supposed to get darker and scarrier as you go, but it's also supposed to get more and more mysterious as well as more and more fantastic.  As each Harry Potter book comes out, it gets better and better, but in \\"the Chamber of Secrets\\" you also meet several new characters and learn more about Voldemort's past.  Two of the best characters you meet are Moaing Myrtle and Tom Riddle.  Of course there's Gilderoy Lockhart and Collin Creevey, who doesn't serve as anything but an annoying tag along.  Then, you get too meet Lucius Malfoy also. <br /> <br />Sometime during the first week back at Hogwarts, Harry is serving detention with Gilderoy (their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher) and he begins to hear a voice that says it wants to kill.  Then, as he is running through the halls with Ron and Hermione, he finds Mr. Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, Petrified and a message from the heir of somebody.  And then he learns of the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.  Hogwarts was founded by Godric Grffyndor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.  It turns out that Salazar Slytherin built a hidden chamber and sealed it before he left until the time when his true heir would come back to Hogwarts and unleash the mnonster within.  So, Harry and Hermione's adventure begins. <br /> <br />The movie is not terribly long, it doesn't feel rushed, and it isn't too short either.  The visual effects are stunning, especially the Dueling Club scene.  The characters are brilliantly protrayed and the movie keeps the mysterious way about it that the book had.  Harrydoesn't understand who he is at some times.  He sometimes wonders if he is evil.  He is not only in the midst of a terror involving life-threatening situations, but he's also fighting with school enemies.  The best things about \\"the Chamber of Secrets\\" is how much more insight you gain on Voldemort's past.  This one also reveals why Hagrid isn't allowed to do magic and why he was expelled.  Plus, you also get to see Ron's home.  You get to learn a bit more about Malfoy's family and about the way the wizarding world works aside from Hogwarts. <br /> <br />The movie is very new and very general.  It gives you a sense of this constantly continuing series.  Now that \\"the Goblet of Fire\\" is out, everybody is wondering how this series is going to turn out.  We've got the book to look forward to and now the movies.  I can't wait to see the results.
B000E8NRR6|3.0|I love the music (5 stars) but DON\\"T waste your money on the Special Edition like I did. The DVD is merely a single still picture showing during the playing of each song. Silly of me to think the V in DVD stood for VIDEO.
B0009WFFS6|1.0|I have the second copy of Cream - Royal Albert Hall - 2005 from Amazon.  The company replaced the first one when Disc 2 wouldn't play at all.  Unfortunately, the second one arrived just after I left the house for a month, and when I returned and tried viewing it, both discs had the same problem as Disc 2 in the first shipment.  Also, unfortunately, Amazon won't take anything back after 30 days, so I got a bum deal with both orders.  Amazon was good about the first replacement, but not being able to even contact anyone about the problem with the second has me bummed out.  After years of buying from Amazon, I will be shopping at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club from now on: they have real people who will really honor their warranties.  Hasta la vista, Amazon. <br />Tom Gennings
0486227073|4.0|Maybe 3-1/2 stars. (Idea & Layout= 5 stars. Drawing quality= 2 stars.)<br /><br />Bridgman's The Human Machine is *exceedingly* ambitious in its scope, and could have been exceedingly successful to match, were it not for its *one* pretty obviously glaring problem: these drawings are exceedingly sketchy!<br /><br />Originally published in 1939, Bridgman passed away in 1943. He was approximately 75 when he made this- possibly a factor in the lack of clarity throughout. If only he had made this at the height of his career(!)- This book is a perfect example of 'what could have been'.<br /><br />Many people revere this work in spite of all this. It may not compare at 1st glance with the slick, computer-aided & enhanced books of today, but if you're willing to get past the obvious sketchiness here you'll find a veritable gold mine of visual information. Take the overall layout & structure for example. In my opinion, this book's presentation easily rivals that of his more polished & refined work- Constructive Anatomy, which has a more awkward interplay between its words & pictures. The Human Machine moves rapidly & logically, building the figure with simple lines first, then showing how bones & muscles interact with each other & with the figure's simplified outline, to give an impression of the whole figure & its parts, all at once in a few detailed pages. It's this *overall* conception of the human figure that appeals to the many who give this work a chance. Bridgman applies all this to the figure's actions & mechanisms as well- it's not just about bones & muscles here, like so many anatomy books tend to be. And Bridgman's lines, though sketchy here, still tend to be an accurate record of the figure, worthy of study. He *usually* chooses his lines with the precision & beauty we've come to expect. But the overall lack of visual clarity here hurts; leaving this genius idea still somewhat unrealized.<br /><br />Overall: The basic *point* of Bridgman's Human Machine is to help people to draw figures more convincingly, and even from memory. To a great degree, at least in my opinion, this book still succeeds in a very effective way...<br /><br />P.S. This book is definitely *not* for beginners! Only *intermediate-level* artists need apply.ly, and even from memory. To a great degree, at least in my opinion, this book still succeeds in a very effective way...  P.S.

B00005JOE8|2.0|Bollocks!  Bollocks I say! V FOR VENDETTA is pure drivel. I get that out of the way at the top of this review because I know it will not be the popular opinion.  But at some point I've realized that I'm nobody if I'm not honest. So I'll say it right now, V FOR VENDETTA is not an action movie, it's a propaganda film.  It's a film about how great anarchy is.<br /><br />About 50 or 70 years into the future Great Britain is run by a totalitarian dictator (John Hurt).  Books, music, and all sorts of free expression are banned.  The government has created a police state that keeps people in line.  Then a shadowy masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) steps out of the shadows and fights the government by exposing their corruption through terrorist actions.  Buildings are blown up, television signals are stolen, and caught in the middle of it all is Evey (Natalie Portman).  Evey, the reluctant student of the mysterious V, will play a pivotal role in overthrow of the government, whether she wants to or not.<br /><br />Now where do I start. On a purely cinematic level this movie is not very fluid. Most scenes revolve around characters talking about how horrible things are.  They talk and talk and then talk some more.  The screenplay is so verbose that any action you may have been expecting flashes by in seconds.  V's origin is told and retold at least 4 different times and there is a subplot involving an actress that just goes on and on.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government.  It's bold and the man involved in the full on attack of the social order doesn't parade around in mask.  He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see.  Yes he pays the consequences for his action, but he used the tools at hand to subvert the government.  He didn't need bombs, he didn't need violence, he just needed to be socially disobedient.<br /><br />But V this movies hero hides behind a mask of platitudes and terrorist actions.  He's too proud to put his face out there for the world to see.  He's like a man who writes a manifesto about how horrible the world is and signs it with an alias.  Who wants to listen to a coward. V believes that the only way to get people to listen is to blow things up and to murder the men in charge.  But what then?  Do you start another government?  Does that one become corrupt?<br /><br />I know its not a popular idea but did you ever just think that maybe human beings are rotten to the core? That our hearts are dark?  That if given the right circumstances we all could be Hitler? I know I've lied, I've stolen things, and I've hurt the people I love the most.  I've even made my wife cry and  I know there are people out there that think I'm a jerk. So I ask you am I good person? I strive to be, but the human condition drags me down.<br /><br />That's why we invent law.  Whether it be moral law, or traffic law, laws are put in place to fight against the human condition.  But Laws are so easily corrupted, from going 35 in a 25 miles per hour zone, or murdering your neighbor for his sneakers, we break laws because we are weak, selfish and at our cores we don't want anybody to tell us what to do.<br /><br />V operates in a place where humans are basically good except for those that disagree with him.  Government and greed are the problems.  He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right.  Organized religion is wrong. Politics is wrong. If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place.  But alas isn't he himself turning his followers into robots? What if one of his followers challenged him?  Would he be labeled a traitor?  Would he be sent away?  The final outcome of V FOR VENDETTA may seem helpful, but why replace one tyranny for another.<br /><br />I know I've gone off on a tangent here. I know my comments may make some people angry. But alas I live in America and for all the horrible things that are going wrong,  I'm glad Ican still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right.  I can question my government without having to resort to terrorist actions and where men and women can believe what they want.  We are \\"One Nation Under God\\", be it a Christian God, or a Muslim God, or Zeus the God Of War.  My faith in America is not in the government.  My freedom is not protected by George W. Bush or V the mysterious masked vigilante.  It come from some place higher, some place stronger than myself.  Terrorism breeds more terrorism. Anarchy breeds nothing but chaos and V FOR VENDETTA is a horrible education in hedonism and nihilism.<br /><br />Do you want change the world?  It begins in the human heart. It begins when you strive to do good regardless of whether the Government is protecting you or not.  It's means dying not for self, but for others and striving for truth and not empty platitudes. V FOR VENDETTA is about a coward, and that's just sad.going wrong,  I'm glad I can still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right.

B000BJ7BCK|4.0|OK, I admit it.  I am a fan of superhero movies!  This was a good one.  Not perfect... it is too predictable.  However, the kid actors are great.  Kurt Russell seemed a bit wooden to me, but the other adults did a great job, and really seemed to be enjoying themselves.  A prime example is \\"Coach Boomer,\\" Bruce Campbell. You'll recognize a lot of other faces here.<br /><br />My wife and daughter loved this movie too.  Our daughter is four, now, and was scared during some of the more intense moments.  It is rated PG for some violence.  No swearing or sex, of course.  This is Disney, after all.<br /><br />So, all in all a really enjoyable movie.  I hope to see a sequel.
B000063JDE|5.0|This film is a view of the world we live in and the gigantic split that exists in society. This film challenges so many things, the violence inherent in society, romanticism, the repression of the true feminine, subjugative power and those who wield it, the weakness and fear lurking under the surface. <br /> <br /> The imagery is quite taut and direct. If you watch the film with a clear mind theres little doubt about the imagery and its meaning. The story refuses to let you get too sentimental and too attached to the characters. It refuses the viewer the hatred they desire for the 'evil' characters, and the sappy attachment to the 'hero' that are in most films. <br /> <br /> For example you see the brutal and deranged Frank, and of course its natural to write him off as 'insane' and move on. When this happens Lynch pulls you back by showing a wounded, unloved, child inside Frank that forces you back into communion with the character, quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also the 'hero' is quite sympathetic if a bit naive early on, but before you get too attached to the character you start to get frustrated with his weakness. He has no verbal or physical defense against any attack, society has sheltered him so much that he has no defense against anything.  <br /> <br /> As someone else said when reviewing this movie, the film is working on so many levels and accessing dark parts of your subconscious that you can feel 'woozy' watching the film. I dont really know what to say about the film other than what I've said. Its an odd film, I dont enjoy it so much its more like an experience.
1592400876|5.0|Don't worry. The apostrophe in the title of this review is deliberate! But what I will say is that to care about punctuation, grammar and spelling does not mean that your own has to be perfect every time. <br /> <br />Make no mistake. This book by Lynne Truss is passionate and evangelical in tone. However, please remove any preconceptions. Lynne is not a maiden aunt in her 70's, but born well after the second world war, and a former columnist of The London Times. I vividly remember her football reports! She is also a self-confessed `stickler'. <br /> <br />The book title emanates from a rather good joke, which I will not spoil, by giving here. The joke is an example of the very readable nature of the words, rather than the dry words that perhaps could be expected from a book that has a zero tolerance approach to bad punctuation. This is a book about rules, current usage and correct English. However, it is readable.  <br /> <br />For those who want further information, the author gives a small bibliography. The best advice, though, is to be aware of what you write, to read extensively, and encourage others to do the same. After Lynne's words, I am now inclined to read with a red correcting pencil in hand (just as she indicates)! <br /> <br />English is a living language, but is one based on some well-established rules and conventions. We ignore these at our peril, but if we stick to best practice, any words written will be more important than the (now correct) structure. Lynne Truss has made a mark in the sand to encourage, cajole and bully us into better use of punctuation. The book worked really well for me. Let it encourage you into better use of punctuation. <br /> <br />Peter Morgan, Bath, UK (morganp@supanet.com) <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|Any album that generates this kind of heat after so long since it was first pressed has got to be full of some kind of magic. \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"Carry that Weight\\" and \\"The End\\" are like one song to me. One beautiful piece of music that makes me feel good everytime I hear it. I always listen to them together.    I'd also like to say that after reading K. Kalikas \\"bulimic gerbil\\" review I have never laughed harder!!!!! God that was funny!

B0000844I8|5.0|This is my favorite Roland Emmerich film. better than TV series.  EVERY characters are totally funny, cute, and humorous, even the villain Ra and his servant. (I think the aliens who is created by Roland Emmerich is all pretty stupid.)  And this music is quite beautiful. and also, a main stage as a star of desert is good thing.  Anyway, I don't mean a criticism of his last work, but I want him to make a sci-fi film with a laugh again.

B000006TRV|3.0|I bought the double-album when it was first released, saw the original live concert at Wembley, and saw the movie when it first came out.  The movie DVD was my first DVD purchase ever, and I bought the audio CD along the way.  But listening to the music now, 20 years or so later, I find it tedious. Hard to admit to, but it's true.   <br /> <br />Having said that, Comfortably Numb is one of the best, most wonderful, most amazing, most awesome songs of all time, bar none.  Run Like Hell is pretty good too!  <br /> <br />Putting it simply, Roger Waters descended into self-indulgence, something that many rock stars did.  I've read the interviews, and yes, this is Roger telling us about his childhood ... not very well.  More recently, I've read the whole soap opera of how Pink Floyd split up.  Quite frankly, while Roger was the early force behind the Floyd, in the later years he wanted to give too much prominence to his indulgent lyrics, and the rest of the band were right to rebel.  I saw an interview somewhere with Dave Gilmour (lead guitar and vocalist), who said that there were just 'too many words' - and I think that applies very well to \\"The Wall\\".   <br /> <br />Basically, The Wall has a few fabulous songs (and that makes it an absolutely worthwhile purchase!), but it's not an album I can listen to in full.  `Meddle' and \\"Dark Side' are better Floyd works.  <br /> <br />I should have known Roger Waters was losing it when I saw \\"The Wall\\" live in concert in London; 75% of the show had the band performing behind a wall on stage ... which is kinda selfish of the band when you paid bucket-loads of money to see them perform (Roger wanted to convey the concept of `separation' that bands felt from their audience ... need I say more).  <br /> <br />
B000E41MS6|5.0|I don't know what the other reviewer's problem was but this set is worth it.  I've been a Doctor Who fan most of my life and I found this season to be one of the best.  Christopher Eccleston is a wonderfully gifted actor and gives the role of the Doctor the respect it deserves.  It is an excellent series for old fans, new fans, or anyone interested in science fiction.
B00005JKG9|2.0|Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film.  It's so aggravating.  I want to chew my own leg off half way into it.  I know part of it is everyone is a \\"talker\\" of a various sort.  They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell.  I just don't think it works.  Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived.  The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves.  It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name.  Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen.

B000AP04FG|2.0|What an incredibly boring movie this would have been without the electricity between Brad and Angelina. This is a pretty typical shoot-'em-up spy caper, with some amusing bits in the therapist's office as the two go for marriage counseling. But the sparks fly the minute these two get into the same room together. Otherwise quite predictable--definitely for an evening of very, very light entertainment. <br />
B00020HEL6|2.0|Yes, Renee has an amazing voice, a gift that cannot be learned or acquired. Yes, it is amazing that she can sing so well for someone so young. But. But. I have to agree with the editorial review and a few of you who do not think this album is the greatest thing since sliced bread. My main objection is the too slick, overly sweet arrangements and vocal gymnastics. I just wish it was pared down and Renee would just sing with feeling instead of trying to throw every vocal trick into every song. Initially I too was amazed at Renee's raw talent but ultimately listening to her makes me need to go back to the classics. If you need a definitive version of \\"Summertime\\" you need go no farther than Sarah Vaughan. And \\"Is you is or is you 'aint My baby\\" begins and ends with Louis Jordan. (With an interesting side trip to visit Joe Jackson) I want to like Renee, I really do, but I think this generation of young performers she is a part of, (Buble, Botti) are attractive for their sizzle and flash, rather than their feeling and interpretation. And I blame much of that on their production and guidance.
B000E8N690|4.0|Now I see why Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar. The story of Johnny Cash is in some ways a typical one-abusive father, beaten down child, escapes into the music world, tries to be a family man but the rigors of the road lead him into drugs and alcohol. Typical but for Cash's incredible luck in having run into June Carter, who, with her family, forces him to get off the pills. Witherspoon in this movie goes from being the silly, cute \\"Legally Blond\\"  type to becoming the most loyal of friends, but tough too. Apparently both Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing-Witherspoon is no singer, and I thought her first number was just a poor dubbing job, but this didn't ruin it for me for a second. If you don't like country music you'll find this drags in spots, but overall it's an engrossing story.
B000002UAC|5.0|I have the vinyl versions of both the English release and the later American release on Capitol--BOTH are in glorious STEREO. Imagine my disappointment when I purchased the CD and found that it was in AM-style MONO!  I still can't believe that George Martin thought that Mono was somehome better.  Wait until you hear them in stereo on the CAPITOL box set (the first four American releases).  They sound FANTASTIC! But they screwed that collection up as well by including on each disc the entire album in stereo--and then AGAIN, in the inferior Mono versions!  Why bother?  I wound up creating a CD with the best of the stereo versions from the Capitol set--and was just about able to put all four albums onto ONE disc!  I left out the two German versions, and only one or two other songs, put them in the order I wanted, and created what COULD have been released but hasn't been.  Hopefully one day they will release the early albums in the British format, but IN STEREO this time!  Until then, get the Capitol set to hear them the way they were meant to be heard!
6305922756|5.0|The only thing funnier than `This Is Spinal Tap' is the people who didn't get the joke. Leafing through the reviews on Amazon and IMDB, I came upon a couple of one star reviews along the lines of `it was an okay documentary but why make a film about this band nobody's heard of when there were lots of better bands around?' There was even one guy who, apparently attempting to appear musically educated, stated that he remembers hearing some of Spinal Tap's hits in the 70's, but they were nothing special. The fact that there are a few who failed to realize that Spinal Tap were a fictitious band, created specifically for this mockumentary, is a testament to the subtle intelligence of the humor and the preciseness of the film's parody, as well as to the dreadful overall state of mainstream rock in the late 70's and early 80's. <br /> <br />In his first feature film, Rob `Meathead' Reiner disguises himself as documentary maker Marty DiBergi and follows around the comeback US tour of has-been heavy metal dinosaurs Spinal Tap. Reiner did not invent the fake documentary - and I don't care what Charlie (or was it Donald?) Kaufman says, it wasn't Fellini either - the concept can be traced back to the brilliant opening scene of `Citizen Kane' and even earlier than that - but no film prior to `This Is Spinal Tap' was this loyal and uncompromising in its documentary structure and in its invented reality. Reiner, Guest and co. took the joke to the very limits, and it's easy to see that with the DVD bonus features, which include TV commercials made by Spinal Tap, video clips, press conferences and TV appearances from across the band's history, even an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. <br /> <br />Spinal Tap are everything that was silly, trite and ridiculous about the music industry in the early 80's. In their Prima Dona behavior, their stupid quarrelling, their idiotic, half-baked pseudo-philosophic wisdom, and most of all in their songs, Spinal Tap put a distorting mirror in front of half the bands that were around at the time; and any band that was insulted because they thought the joke was on them, merely proved the point. The songs use every clich of rock music without shame, and the performances of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as the bandmates are precise, merciless and hilarious. Best of all is Guest as virtuoso guitarist Nigel Tuffnel, who is beyond brilliant in several unforgettable scenes (including the classic `the dials go up to eleven' routine), but is also hilarious when he doesn't say a word; his body language and facial expressions while playing on stage spoof any self-proclaimed genius guitarist of the time, and there's no need for mentioning any names. <br /> <br />Again, what makes `This Is Spinal Tap' great is the subtleness of the humor. Reiner and co. felt no inhibition to supply jokes by the minute as way too many comedies do, and it's an ability he proved again later in the classics `The Princess Bride' and `When Harry Met Sally'. The jokes in `This Is Spinal Tap' do not overshadow the characters and the story told, but with very few actual jokes the film is still unbelievably, consistently, laugh-out-loud roll-on-the-floor funny. Especially for musicians and music lovers in general, who will immediately laugh at many of the easy to miss jokes, `This Is Spinal Tap' is essential viewing, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see. The DVD is also great, with lost of supplemental material and wonderful deleted scenes, including several with the great Billy Crystal.

0792846443|5.0|Both Stephen King and Rob Reiner have lost much of their charm for me in the past fifteen years, but in 1990 they were still in top enough form to create this masterpiece. Having struck gold in 1986 with his memorable adaptation of King's Stand By Me, Reiner made another attempt at the works of the successful suspense artist, and brought along for the task screenwriter William Goldman, with whom he worked before on the film version of Goldman's own novel The Princess Bride (Goldman would later adapt King twice more, somewhat less successfully, with Hearts In Atlantis and Dreamcatcher). <br /> <br />King's writing is clearly at its best when he keeps the supernatural to a minimum; the stark reality is what made Stand By Me powerful, and it worked even better in Misery. Not only does King keep things frighteningly realistic in this story - it's also clearly semi-autobiographical - not, of course, that he was actually kidnapped by a crazed fan, but King's experiences with over zealous fans of his work clearly seeps into the story, and like in The Shining, King writes best when he writes about writers. James Caan does a more than adapt job of playing the bitter, King-ish author Paul Sheldon; master-adapter Goldman (whose credits also include Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men and Marathon Man) did a fantastic job of translating the book into the big screen. <br /> <br />As good a job as Reiner, Goldman and Caan did, this film clearly belongs to Hollywood newcomer Kathy Bates, who won a much deserved Oscar for the role of Annie Wilkes (over old-timers Meryl Streep and Anjelica Huston). Bates is brilliant, frightening and sympathetic in the role which remains the defining role of her acclaimed career, and she makes the character come alive like no other actress could have, proving that being blonde and skinny is not what makes a great actress. Annie Wilkes remains one of the most memorable villains in cinema history, and for good reasons. Caan is excellent in his part, and praise should also go to supporting actors Lauren Bacall and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story), but Bates steals the show from all of them. <br /> <br />Thanks to Kathy Bates' masterful performance and Rob Reiner's wonderful direction, Misery is one of the most powerful and frightening thrillers in cinema history. If anyone needed proof that Reiner was capable of serious dramatic films and not just quotable cult comedies like This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, Misery proved that point, although it doesn't lack in its own quotable one-liners. It's a strong, realistic horror film that doesn't let go. A modern classic and highly recommended.
0140557741|5.0|I ran into a description of this remarkable book that is entirely of images in a Sharon Salzburg's \\"Faith\\" Learning to Trust YOur Inner Experience\\".  Salzburg, a well regarded Buddhist teacher, used Zoom to make that point that at every point of our existence our vision of what is real is always a tiny piece of what really is.. This deceptively simple book is meant to be looked at slowly and contemplatively. Each frame yields to a progressively bigger and bigger view so that the net effect of moving through its expanding perspective is to loosen our imaginations about what we think is the ultimate environment.   Worth spending time with at ANY age.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Of course, I loved the Lord of the Rings films, and I am an avid classical music fan, yet I never really buy movie soundtracks...they just usually seem to be lacking.  I remembered the music from The Fellowship of the Ring and was surprised to find this recording.  I quibbled about spending $55 on this, but hey, that's the cost of the 3-disc classical set, so I thought why not. <br /> <br />This work is utterly beautiful and just amazing - I am in love with it.  I have listened to nothing else since I bought this three days ago.  It is every bit worth the price and I cannot wait until The Two Towers and The Return of the King are released - let's hope. <br /> <br />A lot has been said about the character vocals...I really don't mind them - they were written into the score afterall, and at those times, the focus is meant to be on the character vocals.  <br /> <br />I love the packaging...I think it's put together really well.  However, my main quibble is the booklet.  Yes, it is very informative, but I feel jipped a bit.  Go to: [...] and download the free annotated score - NOW THAT IS what should have been included here.  It has MUCH more information and has all the choral texts - in the original middle-earth language and translated into English, so one can understand the text that is being sung.   <br /> <br />All in all, if you love great classical works, I can't recommend this enough.  Beautiful, just beautiful.
B000001ESF|5.0|Though not the \\"breakthrough\\" album for Rush that it is common supposed to have been--this was actually \\"Hemispheres\\"--\\"2112\\" is a landmark in Rush's creative development and in the development of progressive rock and heavy metal.  It can fairly, though arguably, claim to be the first real Heavy Metal album.  The sonic mud of Black Sabbath, the instrumental incompetence of the band and the drugged-out babble of Ozzie's lyrics made \\"Sabbath\\" incapable of being anything other than something to annoy parents and neighbors with. <br /> <br />\\"2112\\" is the first real achievement of the second generation of hard rock and Rush is the band that made that second generation main stream. <br /> <br />The influence of the pseudo-Nietzchean philospher Ayn Rand on Neil Peart's lyrics--as opposed to his life--has been way over blown.  Peart is a far deeper thinker than Rand ever was and far better writer than she was as well.  Where as Rand spewed out gigantic books filled with one-dimensional characters embalmed in endless pages of incomprehensible polysyllabic babble, \\"2112\\"--the side long piece--presents a comprehensible dystopic future.  A future where, as under the Soviet Union, artistic expression is as tightly controlled as political expression.  The intelligent tyrants always understand that controlling art is as much a tool of controlling the masses as control of the police and the military.  The horizons of acceptable expression must be guided through the channels of the party or the religious dogma. <br /> <br />\\"2112\\"'s protagonist finds a guitar in cave.  Elated with his discovery, the chance to bring some color into the drab life of totalitarian existence, he presents his discovery to the head tyrant.  (Much of this detail as included in the liner notes of the LP, excised from the CD).  The tyrant-priest goes on a rant, smashes the guitar and banishes the intruding fool who whold have disturbed the existing social order--and endangered his power. <br /> <br />Musically Rush is still very much under the tutelage of Zeppelin, Cream and Yes.  But they have already begun to hone the unique sound that first appeared on the brilliant--and unfairly maligned predecessor to this album--\\"Caress of Steel\\" (perhaps the coolest album title ever).   <br /> <br />The parts that go to make up the whole of \\"2112\\" are much more co-hesive and do tell the story of our hapless protagonist.  The intro blazes into a Zeppelinque bombs-away (foreshadowing the song cycle's climax by quoting the main theme from the \\"1812 Overture).  \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\" presents the world through the eyes of the priests.  Life is pretty sweet for them, as it always is for the rulers, so why should they put a seal of approval upon anything which might interrupt this cozy state of affairs.  Blazing guitar work and the intricate interplay of bass and drums that would become the hallmark of Rush's sound for the next 30 years are all in place.  While Lifeson's guitar would shift from Pagian/Claptonian heroics to harmonic color, and back again, the recipe for 30,000,000 US records and decades of ultra-succesful tourign were well and truly laid. <br /> <br />The high point of both the album and \\"2112\\" is \\"The Oracle.\\"  The distortion and crunch give way to a much subtler sound and when the inevitable bombs-away beings its a much more deft and agile sound.  The lyrics of freedom against a soul-deadending despostim are also stirring (though perhaps less so to a generation whose grown up without the shadow of the Soviet Union). <br /> <br />If you can listen to Rush play \\"2112\\" live in concert and not leap to your feet, something's wrong with you.  While \\"Hemispheres\\" would refine the side-long piece/concept album to the point beyond which only reptition was possible, the basics are all here on this album.  \\"Hemispheres\\" reaches an orchestral pitch that \\"2112\\" does not, as its does intellectually as well, but \\"Hemispheres\\" cannot top the raw power of three musicians bound and determined to defy not only the musical conventions of the day but the pressures of the \\"industry\\" to conform to more \\"accessible\\" themes and forms.   <br /> <br />It is this defiance, which pulses through ever note and drum-beat that separates \\"2112\\" from every other Rush album.  These three Canadians from the suburbs were going their own way with a vengeance.  It's a joy to listen to this clarion call to individualism and freedom (things which had little in common with Rand's incoherence, the latter being something which Peart quickly picked up on as he clearly realized that Rand was motivated not buy the beauty of freedom but solely by the hatred of the oppressor who drove her family from Russia). <br /> <br />The second side of the album is a decidedly mixed bag of stylistic experiments.  \\"Something for Nothing,\\" the album's closing number is a straight ahead rocker in the manner of \\"Bastille Day.\\"  Ferocious riffs, wicked fills and driving bass dominate it and deliver one of the most polished pieces of hard rock ever mined by this band. <br /> <br />\\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" is easily the best song on the second side.  From the quirky microtones of the intro to the rugged rythym this songs celebrates, as one Rush biographer put it, \\"a connosier's appreciation...\\" of what is left for you to decided. <br /> <br />\\"The Twilight Zone\\" is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to Rod Serling.  And like the tongue-in-cheek (or should we say \\"in toupee\\"?) \\"I Think I'm Going Bald\\" on \\"Caress\\" it doesn't accomplish what it sets out to.  The music of \\"Twilight Zone\\", however, cannot be ignored, as the rambling, bumbling \\"Going Bald's\\" tune can and should be. <br /> <br />\\"Lessons\\" and \\"Tears\\" are forgettable stabs in the direction of the soft/folk rock of James Taylor, Peter Frampton and the Eagles who were beginning to replace Zeppelin and the other \\"dinosaurs\\" as the Seventies moved toward their terrible climax.  They should be give one listen and then relegated to the CD when you thealbum to your iPod. <br /> <br />Normally the missteps on side two (one song average, two mediocrities) would merit dinging a star off an album.  But this Rush and this is \\"2112.\\"  If all they had delivered was the nearly 20 mins of Side One (ahhh, records, anyone miss 'em?  Didn't think so), this would be known as one of the most perfect EPs ever recorded.  As it is, the rousing achievement of \\"2112\\" drowns out the mistakes of the Side Two and, in the memory of Rush fans, leaves only \\"2112\\" behind. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a place to begin your journey into the every rewarding world of Rush, 2112 is the place to start.  It is the keystone by which the three albums that went before can be judged and the foundation for the 13 studio albums that were to follow. <br /> <br />If you can't get past hating Geddy's voice--as my wife can't--then the loss is, sadly, yours.  You'll be depriving yourself of the incredible musical and lyrical talents of Canada's greatest and most succesful musical group--as well as those of the greatest living bassist and drummer and one of the greatest guitarists. <br /> <br />Rush is that almost extinct breed of artist in this age where marketing and packaging, focus-groups and market research take the place of talent and inspiration: they have no egomaniacal need to parade their private lives before you.  They only want to deliver music.  Whether anyone else likes it or not is irrelevant to them.  In the \\"American Idol\\" universe this makes them a treasure indeed.

The covers of very very commercial songs by Robert Palmer and MAdonna are found beside some quite weird experimental Sonic Youth fare. However it worked at the time and the CD stands up quite well.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|This is a bunch of artificial sounds crappily put together, containing all the feeling, depth and richness of a plastic lid. Then there are the lyrics, almost deliberately idiotic cliches repeated mindlessly. This album has little to offer to anyone with a decent ear.

B00005JL2O|2.0|I was so excited to see this movie. when i saw in theaters i immediatly though well it was good atthe beggining which is true. the entire movie is hilarious with at the beggining showing Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, etc. but after the first hour it got wierd with Scott (Seth Green) going bald because he was turning evil, which was funny till the very end (i'll get to that). the agent with the mole is where a lot of the jokes are aimed at. <br />      <br />   Later in the movie i thought \\"what happened to Felicity (Heather Graham)? well i dont know and i guess they forgot about her but the movie starts to fall apart Austin Powers(Mike Myers)meets Goldmember(Mike Myers) and thats where the worst character in the movie comes. he is just gross little kid humor over PG13 humor. He meets Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) who had never called again i think because he was frozen. <br />  <br /> Him in Foxy go through the movie till the end where Scott is completly evil and more than Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) which set it off then they where told that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are brothers which made me very angry because that was the worst ending they could possibly come up with. <br />  <br /> So if you watch the movie keep this in mind and be sure that you see the first 2 first.

B000784WMW|4.0|This movie was great.  It was first intended for tv.  I wish it did not give the credits at the beginning and end of every \\"episode\\".
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I suppose being the second worst movie ever made (as opposed to the first, which is clearly \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate) adds to the mediocrity of this film. I should, however, quantify this claim. Surely there are movies with worse acting, worse direction and worse writing. But those movies all share a common thread: they are all B-movies. This film, on the other hand, is a multi-million dollar SFX extravaganza. A \\"tour de force\\" (funny how that term has become a compliment to action movies) packed with big-name actors and CGI in every frame. Even if Hollywood wants to make no-brainers, we should at the very least expect more from them than THIS. This is one of those movies that is so incredibly bad that it's hard to even heckle it. How do you say something clever about a movie when you've nothing to do but stating the obvious? If you're a fan of \\"The Haunting,\\" \\"The Relic,\\" \\"Batman and Robin,\\" \\"The Ring 2,\\" \\"Alone in the Dark\\" and (of course) \\"Van Helsing\\" then maybe you won't hate this movie. Then again, if you liked all those movies, your standards are far below what might still be considered within the normal human range and I must presume that you are in fact either a house pet who doesn't really know what its watching (just lots of pretty shining colors) or a severely mentally-challenged individual. <br /> <br />It's a shame that the leading female role in every action movie these days is just another cookie-cutter Elektra tough-girl archetype. Why? God, WHY? This movie typifies this trend exemplarily. It seems that women in cinema are relegated either to this or to the \\"damsel in distress\\" crap. Between these two polar opposites (and the occasional bizarre synthesis of the two) I suppose we're not allowed to enjoy any kind of real female characterization. Maybe writers, who have nothing more than comic books from which to draw their experience of women, find this too daunting a task. <br /> <br />Where to go next...it's all so bad. Ah, at the end one of the villains was redeemed! Yay! Good triumphs over a wicked heart. Blah. I can appreciate this device if used well. It was not. One of the antagonists, who had opposed our hapless heroes and worked to their failure and destruction from the beginning, suddenly decided to \\"change his mind\\" at the end. No progression. Though it was at the sight of one of the Grimm Bros. dead (I'm sorry, did I forget to mention that this is a spoiler? He wasn't really dead), that still makes no sense, for he wanted to kill the Grimms anyway. This is a man who's job was to torture people to death. This is a man who, near the beginning, kicked a small kitten into a whirling vortex of mechanical death. He was not a good guy misunderstood. <br /> <br />The plot of this movie makes the writing behind \\"The Mummy Returns\\" look cohesive; hell down right plausible (in case you forgot, that movie's plot didn't even mesh with its predecessor). Did I mention that what they did to the Grimm fairy tales is an utter travesty? <br /> <br />\\"Aah,\\" you say. \\"But this is a Comedy!\\" How dare I be so harsh on a comedy. Really? Through the course of the entire movie, I laughed but once. The rest of the audience, by the way, was equally un-amused. <br /> <br />Seeing this movie initially made me mad. I didn't just want my money back, I wanted my time back. One-and-a-half hours of my life down the tube. But I felt better the following week when I saw \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\" (if you'll remember from the first paragraph, the worst movie ever). I didn't feel so angry about \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" after that.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I am shocked by any negative reviews of anything this Midas of Music touches. I feel they are posted just to provoke a reaction. And the continual bemoaning of this not being as good as Nightfly is atavistic immaturity.  Denigrating Dan or Don albums because they don't live up to your personal favorites is a pointless exercise in solipsistic futility.  And for those reviewers parsing the boring technical formulae to demonstrate how he rips himself off - you're missing the point.  Donald Fagen is untouchable - you know it and every musician alive or dead knows it.  His is the gold standard and I have yet to hear a contender to the throne.     And of course there is nothing new here.  Just more of the same sparkling, smooth sophistication that the man invented and patented.  It's ridiculously new and fresh by virtue of it being new material.  Timeless and instantly classic. Blah, blah, blah. There are no new superlatives to be tagged to this rhythmelodic savant.  He is the master and any carping on your part is spittle in the wind. Wanting something unpredictable from him is like smoking a fatty or drinking your favorite wine and getting bummed that it's the same old effect.    That said I find the layered choruses to be incredibly and gloriously uplifting.  While this is the most serious and critical subject matter he's ever penned, the music is some of the most subtly positive he's ever composed.  And it all flows so smoothly and stealthily, without the peaks and valleys I found on the last 2 Dans.     Absolutely essential, but we knew that before the wrapper came off.  Puts almost the entire recording industry and the rest of my collection to shame.      Wake up, hit album repeat, go about your day, and have it slip into your dreams.

So, needless to say, I was thrilled to stumble upon this book during one of my frequent trips to the bookstore. <br /> <br />This is a memoir of Anthony's life, not a biography of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, although they do of course have their relevance to the story. Anthony describes his early childhood of coming from a broken marriage and subsequently ending up in California, where he lived with his father. <br /> <br />Although he looked up to his father, it was not an ideal atmosphere for a child. Anthony's father was heavily into drugs, both as a user and a dealer. He even had a special room set aside in their home where he would weigh the drugs and then get them ready for the steady stream of customers. It was a constant party environment. This of course led to Anthony's using drugs when he was 11 years old, setting the stage for a lifetime of struggles with substance abuse. <br /> <br />This in turn set the scene for Anthony's introduction to sex, also at a young age. This encounter was set up by his father, at Anthony's own request, when he was about 12 years old. As it was, his father was a womanizer, and there was constantly a ready and willing woman within arm's reach.  <br /> <br />Anthony describes his experiences with school, and how he always made an effort to do well and get good grades. It was a source of pride for him to be able to succeed in school, even though his home life was so chaotic and unpredictable, and he admittedly had a problem with authority. <br /> <br />Then, in high school, he chronicles how he met Flea and Hillel, future band mates and lifelong friends, until Hillel's early death at the age of 25.  <br /> <br />At one point, Anthony  attempted to become an actor, and took acting classes, even getting a few jobs. Ultimately, his desire for this fizzled out in light of other pursuits. <br /> <br />Further on, he talks of the band's  individual attempts at creating music and learning to play it to begin with, and how one friend's request for them to play at some club turned into a stepping stone for the official formation of the Chili Peppers, and it's many trials and tribulations. They were constantly having personnel change, usually in the form of a new guitar player, a new drummer, or both at the same time. Dave Navarro played with them at one point. <br /> <br />They had trouble finding a label, much less anyone who was really interested in furthering any musical career as far as they were concerned. Anthony talks of his various attempts at song writing, and his own insecurities with his voice and singing prowess. Later on, he expresses frustration with the song 'Under the Bridge', and how he was never really comfortable singing that song because he felt he could never get it right. He didn't even want to record the song and was surprised when it became well received by the public. <br /> <br />Throughout all of this, he of course battled with his cocaine and heroin addictions. It is amazing to what lengths he would go to in order to score drugs and get what he wanted. He was not above pawning his, or other people's valuables, or begging drugs from the dealers with the promise that he was good for the money, when in reality he wasn't. At least not until the band's success really took off and he was loaded with money. He describes going on massive drug binges and how he would constantly rationalize with himself that he'd just do a little bit more and then he'd quit for good. Or, he'd go on a binge and then run off to a warm clime where he isolated himself and did what he could to kick the habit,  at least for a brief time.  <br /> <br />Usually, when forced, he'd enter a structured rehab environment. Or, he'd go home to his mother in Michigan and attempt to detox away from Hollywood. Even so, his attempts at living clean very seldom lasted, aside from a 5 and a half year period at one point, and since his more recent attempt in 2000. <br /> <br />He further describes a somewhat nomadic way of living, be it sponging off of a friend or girlfriend's good will, or being able to secure his own living quarters for a short period of time. <br /> <br />This book is frank in its descriptions of Anthony's quest for sexual gratification with groupies, or with women he met whom he felt a connection with and wanted in his bed. Some of these women became his girlfriend, and seamlessly fit right in with his chaotic life of drug abuse and depravity.  <br /> <br />You learn of Anthony's fleeting friendship with Sonny and Cher respectively, his relationship with Ione Skye and Sofia Coppola, plus a passing acquaintance with River Phoenix, whom he wrote about in a song. He also talks of touring with Pearl Jam and Nirvana and his impressions of Kurt Cobain.. Not to mention an unrequited relationship with Sinead O' Connor. George Clinton was a mentor for a time and was influential in one of their album's recordings. He was once granted a meeting with the Dalai Lama. <br /> <br />Anthony has certainly led a colorful life, full of colorful people, who have each touched him or affected his life in various ways. He leads you down the rocky path of his life with unflinching honesty and introspection, as well as a dash of humor. Needless to say, this book was eye opening and enthralling, and at times made me shake my head in disbelief. I'd definitely recommend it, yet, as I first stated... this is not a biography of the Chili Peppers. It's a memoir of Anthony's life, Scar Tissue and all.
B0009YA386|5.0|I Hope This Album gets plenty of air play in the States.There is a revival in the Uk Music Scene at the moment with the Brit Press Going Potty over The Arctic Monkeys.The Arctics are very good but they have put a smokescreen over the Brilliance of this Band.The Editors are a class act with a class debut album.It all depends if people bother to give them a go.The Uk Music Scene is back,I Predict A Riot.
0790729652|5.0|Here it is. The legendary telling of Batman's Story. Tim Burton went through great lengths to make this movie a jumping point for many superhero movies to come. In my opinion, It's the first Superhero movie with the right stuff.<br /><br />Take the opening sequence: At first, a low-level tune is slowly creeping it's way into our ears. The camera shifts in and out of several tunnels and curves to be revealed later, and well done, the unforgettable Batman Symbol.<br /><br />Take the setting: Typicl Gotham which is a cross between the gritty new york streets and the L.A. ones. Shrouded in architectual beauty and shadowey magnificance. Each corner is different, each pedestrian has there own worries, each smoking sewer grail symbolizes a film noir town that is on the brink of colapsing.<br /><br />Take the hero: Batman, in this movie, is just starting to become a legend. It's true that the papers, journalists, and even the police don't know who this masked man is or why he has chosen to become a lone vigilante when it comes to Gotham's Problems.<br /><br />Take the plot: You have a hero who is also a double identity, living amongst the people that he must save. You have the calssic new reporter, Vikki Vale, who has come to the gotham city becuase she's heard of the legendary Batman and wants to know more about him. Then there's Bruce Wayne. The Perfect actor, Michael Keaton, to play the suave millionarie one minute and the Dark Knight the next. In this movie you will take a glimpse into his home, mansion is rather the more appropriate word, and get a taste of what it's like to be a lonely rich boy growing up with a butler, Alfred, as a father. Then, last but not least, we have a view of Jack Nicholson,a.k.a. Jack Napier. Once a ruthless criminal who has a highly intelligent criminal mind. The Perfect Adversary.<br /><br />You'll see stunts, gadjets, comic-like images, and everything that Tim Burton can whip up to make this the one classic Batman movie that Stands alone.<br /><br />If I could describe this movie in one word, it would have to be Perfection.<br /><br />This is the only movie in my movie library that I will never get sick of. I watched it a hundred times as a kid and a hundred more growing up. It's the one movie that inspires would-be writers and directors. Buy this movie!ds alone. <br /> <br />If I could describe this movie in one word, it would have to be Perfection. <br /> <br />This is the only movie in my movie library that I will never get sick of.

B00007JMCX|5.0|Oh what a mesmerizing film this is by Mr. Roeg. It plays oh so delicately with time and meaning.. It is an art film which at times appears like it is trying to appeal to our normal cinematic senses...but it is a deeper allegory. David Bowie stars, at the height of his powers, as the strange and alienated alien Mr Newton - and delivers a smashing performance. Even if you don't like the movie - you will appreciate David Bowie's enigmatic presence - he is something else! This is a beautiful movie abounding with beautiful images and landscapes - and an overall feeling of disorientation..
0062515675|1.0|The norwegian translation of this book states on the sleeve: The eternal wisdom presented in a completely new way.  <br /> <br />Nothing could be further from the truth: Mr. Sharma seems to have made a porridge of the most easily digestible versions of eternal wisdom and the most glib and superficial versions of self-help books on the market, and put whatever rose to the surface in a \\"fable\\" strangely lacking in any form of drama or power to transform or inspire.  <br /> <br />I admire those who can find upliftment in this flat copy of others` ideas, but rereading \\"Autobiography of a yogi\\" and reading Malcolm Gladwell`s \\"Blink\\" around the same time as I had the misfortune to encounter this book, the difference in quality is staggering.  <br /> <br />Puzzled, I looked up Mr. Sharmas home page, and found the most blatant piece of commercialism and grandiose self-advertisement in the self-help field - no mean feat in a field of strong and heavy competition. <br />It`s obvious who bought the monk`s Ferrari.
B000002AGE|4.0|It is hard to go against the multitude of 5 - star reviews, but this is not the best 'Weather Report' album. It is a good one though - and the contributions of Jaco Pastorius, in particular, make this a very nice listening experience.. Maybe it is the compositions that are lacking.. Zawinul seems to be not quite as sharp as he was on 'Black Market'. The overall vision of this album, in fact, is more towards what was to come in the 80's than some of the more interesting side routes the band took on earlier albums.. Overall very enjoyable, and pleasing, just not the groundbreaking album that Weather report was capable of producing.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|A while back as I was going through the rudimentary everything Pink Floyd binge.  I started longing for something else, something new.  If I could JUST HEAR another one of those VIRTUOSIC SOLOS that David Gilmour has helped center around the face of Pink Floyd for over 30 years.  I started thinking this would never happen, a reunion is out of the question, and David Gilmour hasnt released anything in 20 some odd years, not to mention the guys are in their early sixties, how much is left in the tank? <br /> <br />Well, you can imagine my relief when I found out that David Gilmour was planning a new album, however what could I really expect... <br /> <br />Let me start off by saying this CD is incredible, from the opening intro to the ending notes I was in shock.  When the first song \\"Castellorizon\\" kicks in after 2 minutes of intro, tears began to well up in my eyes, that patented Gilmour solo breaks loose about 2:17 and pulsates through my veins.  I prefer to listen to the CD in its entirety, theres not one weak track on here. <br /> <br />If the opening song doesnt get you, than theres nothing left for you to read, I'm not sure what many reviewers are looking for in this music but for those who think its too \\"mellow\\", what were you expecting?  Remember the long slow melodic \\"Echoes\\", or the inspiring \\"Wish You Were Here\\", how about Gilmour era Pink Floyd?  Long slow melodic songs has been apart of pink floyd since the beginning.   <br /> <br />This is a review of David Gilmours solo CD so why do I even mention pink floyd?  Because this CD brings me back to those times.  The solos, the vocals (in superb condition) the orchestral backround, and that saxaphone in \\"Red Sky at Night\\" gives me shivers everytime. <br /> <br />Some say David Gilmour isnt much of a lyricyst.  I say to hell with it, the music tells its own story, theres so much energy and feeling in it he doesnt even need lyrics.  I'm not one to criticize for lyrics anyhow, I've never had a problem with whator how he writes. <br /> <br />This CD is for anyone that is a fan of Pink Floyd, Gilmour, Strong Musicianship, or looking for something soothing.
B00004W52U|5.0|Energy is, without a doubt, one of the greatest ska/punk albums of all time.  Released in 1991, this album shows so much raw emotion.  This single album influenced so many well-known bands that you here these days, such as Green Day, Sum 41, and NOFX.  Operation Ivy sang about controversial issues such as the East Bay, police, and violence. Every time you listen, you can here the urgent plea of Operation Ivy begging us to unite.   <br /> <br />One of the reasons this album is a classic is its musicianship.  Simple, yet perfectly arranged guitars from Tim Armstrong (credited as Lint), excellent drumming courtesy of Dave Mello, brilliant bass from Matt Freeman (credited as Matt McCall) and raw, passionate vocals from Jesse Michaels.  To some, Energy may be poorly recorded.  This is true, but it shows the passion of the band.   <br /> <br />Although short-lived, Operation Ivy left a huge mark on modern music as we see it today. This excerpt from \\"Journey to the End of the East Bay\\" recorded by Rancid (formed by Tim and Matt after Operation Ivy) tells the story through their perspective.  \\"Started in '87 ended in '89, you got a garage or an amp, we'll play anytime. It was just the four of us, yea the core of us, too much attention unavoidably destroyed us. Four kids on tour three thousand miles in a four door car not knowing what was going. Years it would turn out like this. Hell, no no premonition could have seen for.\\"
B00005JOE8|1.0|Okay, <br /> <br />So I am hungering for some kind of semi-intelligent action, suspense film with some story line.  I have been watching V for Vendetta am aware of the comic book, have read the comic book \\"The Watchmen\\" by Alan Moore, even Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns. I love films as diverse as Shoalin Master Killer, Cinema Paradisio, Lawrence of Arabia, Master and Commander, A Man of all Seasons, and Spiderman 2.  So I go tonight to be entertained and am quite aware of the material ahead of time.  What happens? I LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE DISGUSTED as I am watching liberal lunatic Hollywood Preach at me with their totally screwed up value system very carefully bundled in what was suppose to be an suspense/action movie but REALLY is some kind of Bizaare Frothing at the Mouth Screamathon on the Bush Administration and anyone with conservative/traditional or even moderate Liberal Values. I can put up with the usual Hollywood Leftist Claptrap, but I think it was the Middle Interlude in which the movie slowed down enough for about 15 minutes to introduce me to someone completely useless and unrelated to the plotline whatsoever.  Who is this person?  WHy a HALO WEARING HOMOSEXUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLSGIRL who grew up to become homosexual actresses that become imprisoned by their government and killed. (She was apparently born that way yet Science has yet to prove this piece of \\"PROPOGANDA\\"..of course its the EVVVULLL Government who is in charge of Propoganda in this film...NOT THE FILMAKERS..they are the PURVEYOR OF TRUTH LOL....Why because they make MOVIES what a noble and intelligent endeavor..they are wise beyond their years.)  THis IRRELEVANT BACKSTORY CAME of course AFTER the EVVVVULLLLLLL CHRISTIAN PRIESTS who were in on a conspiracy to murder people and were breaking their vows of celibacy with Prostitutes.  Or PERHAPS it irked me when YET another previous character GOOD character ALSO happened to be gay? (Apparently most of the world is homosexual..not the 1 to 2% the statistics tell us) Question Hollywood: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A BAD EVULLLLL HOMOSEXUAL IN A HOLLYWOOD FILM OR DO THEY ALL FIGHT FOR GOOD AND JUSTICE AND THE OPPRESED?  I had a very good snicker where this enterprising homosexual had an old version of the KORAN...that had been \\"Banished\\" by the current facist government in which he was hiding in his private \\"ART\\" collection. He quote, \\"Loves its poetry\\"..what a patronizing view of religion.  I wonder if that homosexual knows that the \\"KORAN\\" expressly forbids his behavior and that his obsession with sexual identity (And the Filmmakers) is incompatiable with Islamic doctrine. <br />   <br /> <br />So I ask myself this Question...Why is every movie I am going to nowadays filled with the following <br />1. POLITICS <br />2. HOMOSEXUAL PROPOGANDA <br /> <br />I am a super movie buff but am now done with Hollywood for a good long while after this season.  Frothy-homosexual-terrorist sympathizing crazed MOONBATS  I liked the Matrix even their subpar sequels but the Brother's W and Joel Silver need an injection of Reality. <br /> <br />I do hope though that \\"V\\" himself comes to take on Hollywood soon and make his OWN rebellious films...you know the ones that make smart entertainment and leave out the relentless politics. It would be shocking to see a film actually entertain use and even SHOCK OF SHOCKS ESPOUSE SOME KIND OF MORAL VALUE SYSTEM...THAT would be BEYOND refreshing.  Who knows maybe hollywood's version of \\"V\\" is Mel Gibson....GO MEL! <br />ONWARD TO APOCOLYPTO! <br /> <br />Ohhh by the way the stuff I was harping about?...NOT IN THE COMIC BOOK.  Hollywood thought they could tell the story better their way.  No wonder Alan Moore distanced himself from this re=write <br />
B000C20VRS|4.0|If you have been waiting for a decent release of Scarface, and were disappointed by the horrible releases in the past, your wait is over.  Universal has finally given this exceptional film the decent transfer it deserves.  I rented the original release (thank goodness) and literally could not watch it.  I watch movies on a 120\\" diagonal screen, so poorly transfered movies look very bad, and I will not watch non-anamorphic transfers at all. This version also has a 5.1 soundtrack, unlike the original release which is pretty good. <br /> <br />So I hope this goes a long way to answer the previous reviewer's question, and just in case:  The other releases were HORRIBLE! <br /> <br />I will not go into detail with a review of the film as this has already been done-to-death via the other releases.  However, I would just say while certainly a well-crafted film, I do not hold it on the same level as \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Casino\\", \\"The Godfather\\" films, etc., as to me it is not so much a \\"gangster/mafia\\" movie as it is an unblinking drama -- a look a crime, greed, violence, and a distorted view of the \\"American Dream.\\"
0895260131|5.0|I especially liked the side by side comparisons between Christ and Muhammed.  You must read this book.  What many people refer to as \\"radical\\" Islaam is mainstream.  The only peaceful and tolerant Muslims are the ones who do not practice Islaam as it is presented in the Koran.  Muhammed was a warlord who spread Islaam through force and violence.  The Koran is very clear from start to finish, there is no tolerance for other faiths.  Either convert, face servitude, or face death.  The western world with all our self loating is in jeopardy today.  Sharia law is the commandment of the Koran, and mainstream Islaam is imcompatible with democracy.  Read this book, it is very eye opening about the true nature of Islaam, that \\"political correctness\\" prevents public figures from discussing publicly.
B000777J2S|1.0|\\"I am a bird now.\\" Please, someone... this bird is injured. Not exotic. Put this band out its misery.  <br /> <br />The singer's voice is too affected/self-indulgent to be interesting. It is just annoying. Perhaps, not boring, just painful offkey melodrama. Off key is okay. Melodrama can be good. But, damn, the lyrics and music are awful and witless. The singer may want to be the Greta Garbo of the transgendered. But, he (at least as he postures on this album)... he isn't intriguing. <br /> <br />He seems like a dope.  You want to avoid him because you feel humilated for him. At first one may listen to and smile indulgently at him because one thinks he isn't a very bright seventh grader and you assume he is oblivious to a world outside of himself.  <br /> <br />I keep trying to listen to this album. If I change my mind and like Antony and the Johnsons, I will write another.  (But... I think I would require extensive brain damage and near deafness. So far I haven't managed to listen to the entire thing at one time. )
B000062TU1|5.0|Great movie!!  Good price- and I received it much sooner than I expected!
0425170349|3.0|Other reviewers will tell you Tom Clancy knows his stuff. They'll tell you it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Don't listen to them -- as for knowing his stuff, for a man obsessed with the most intricate of military details, Tom makes some bizarre errors; two examples include referring to CFB (Canadian Forces Base) Gander as RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force -- a defunct entity for decades) Gander and referring to the Heckler und Koch MP5 chambered in 10mm Auto as an MP-10 (the hyphen and number are both quite wrong). For the laymen who wouldn't know about Canadian forces restructuring or firearms details, this is no big deal. For somebody who's written about nuclear submarines, this is as goofy as nuclear physicist writing a paper on subatomic particles being held together with glue and bits of twine. <br /> <br />The plot is plodding at times and bizarre. The Stukas ride in a Spanish theme park (right, like the A-Bomb flume in Japan), the injection of Clancy's right wing politics in various spots throughout the book, the almost sad need to reference his glory days as an Iron Curtain writer by repeatedly mentioning the Cold War and the Soviet Union, and the goofy plot that I won't spoil for you mar this otherwise decent yarn. <br /> <br />Rainbow Six is good at what it is: military porn. Sure, the starlets may be a little old and they flub their lines, but they'll pass in a pinch. War & Peace it ain't.
B000000WHX|5.0|I first heard this album about 6 years ago and was amazed by the sound. I am not a big hip-hop or electronica or dance music fan but I really liked the sound Massive Attack created. Now after repeated listens it is still a favorite of mine. Their sound has aged better than a number of similar bands from the time like Portishead. <br />The album combines a dark, night-time ambience with a generally hopeful, soulful sound. My favorites on the album are Safe From Harm, Unfinished Sympathy, Blue Lines and Be Thankful For What You've Got.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Before purchasing this cd, I read dozens of reviews. All of them described Hail to the Thief as a good but not great album. This is a fantastic album for any avid Radiohead fan. The music is engrossing, and Thom Yourke's singing on this album is both briliant and diverse.    This ablum also has been described as part Ok Computer, part Kid A. A true assement, however, it leans more towards Kid A.   Compared to what would be found on Ok Computer, Hail to Theif sounds much more like Kid A then anything else. Although it seems like Radiohead dives back into their past on a few tracks.    Regardless, this album is a masterpiece, and should not be left behind in any Radiohead collection. This album is very underated, and might need a few listens before one can apreciate it.    FAVORITE TRACKS: 2+2=5, Sit Down, Stand up, Sail to the Moon, Backdrifts, Go to Sleep, There, There, A Punch Up At a Wedding.
B00007K02F|5.0|I have always loved the epic tale of Jane Eyre, but this movie brings out the emotional values written in the book exquisitely! I give it 2 thumbs up!!!
B000E97X66|4.0|I too was at the 1975 Springsteen show at the Hammersmith Odeon.  It was brilliant.  I too remember Springsteen's version of 'Pretty Flamingo' and it was, for me, a high point in a great show.  So it's a pity that it is not included here--though I have to say that it was a *very* long spoken intro as I recall so that might have had to have been dropped!  What is here is great but it is worth remembering that Springsteen owed a lot to earlier rockers, as he himself has always been the first to admit.
8590379817|5.0|The book Programming in Lua is an excellent book on the Lua language. It helps clear up many of the questions I had about entries and usage cases in the Reference Manual. The book also includes many examples that can be readily used by the reader.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions is the best Madonna since 'Ray Of Light' for the very fact that Madonna has returned to what she does best - get our groove on and take over the dancefloor. With this record, a non-stop mix of 56 minutes of devilish dance ditties, Madonna channels ABBA, Donna Summer, and even herself- the fun and spunky 80's Madonna, now in a more sophisticated light which never loses her footing on fun and dancing. First single 'Hung Up' is just a taste of what's in store, and actually I don't even listen to 'Hung Up' anymore and skip to the other tracks! <br /> <br />'Get Together' is reminsicent of a mash-up between 'September' by 'Earth Wind and Fire' and 'One More Time' by 'Daft Punk', 'Future Lovers' is a cousin of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love'. The sublime 'I Love New York' and hypnotizing 2nd single 'Sorry' are just so hard to resist, you'll be tapping your feet under your desk in no time. In more autobiographical cuts like 'How High' and 'Let It Will Be' Madonna takes on the role of storyteller while letting you float in the dreamy and surreal sounds of the songs. The centerpiece of the album is the epic 6-minute 'Isaac' which reminds us of 'Shanti' from the Ray of Light album, mystic and hypnotizing. I recommend this album to Euro-pop/dance lovers, club setters and any fun loving person in general. This is Madonna at what she does best.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|IMHO, one of the best albums ever produced and my personal all-time favorite.  I can listen to GRACELAND over and over and never grow tired of any of these exceptional performances.  On a five-star scale, I give it six.
1592401791|5.0|Honestly, I didn't initially have much hope for this book. Another Beatles book.... ho hum. What else is there to say that hasn't been said before??  <br />Well there is ALOT more to be said. Mr Emerick takes us into the studio with the Beatles and you become the fly on the wall during the history making hours at Abbey Road studios. He won them over during his first session as their engineer by fulfilling John's request to make him sound like \\"the Dalai Lama chanting from a mountaintop\\". He was responsible for the ground breaking sounds of Revolver, Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road. He did things with speakers and microphones and instruments and tape machines that had NEVER been done before. The Beatles pushed him to make them sound like no one had ever sounded before and he responded by throwing conventional sound engineering out the window. The bar was being raised for all involved.  <br />Mr. Emerick never gets into the all too common in other Beatles books comments on the Beatles sex lives or who Brian Epstein had a crush on. This book talks about their music and how it was made. He does report on the crazy goings on in the studio, such as when Yoko was ill and lying in a bed in the studio or when George calls her a b**** for eating his biscuits. He reports on quite a few amusing incidents like that, but he never loses the key focus: the music and how it was made.  <br />Mr. Emerick and his co-writer Howard Massey take some rather complex technical processes and make them easily understood by us non techno geeks. The book is an easy read. I found it fascinating how he had an interest in the way sounds were made from a very early age and stayed faithful to that interest, eventually impressing his high school counselor so much that he helped a 15 year old Geoff get a job at Abbey Road.  <br />The Beatles are the main subject here and there is plenty about all of them. The pleasant (maybe too?) Paul, the loose cannon Lennon, the aloof Harrison who grew to have Geoff's respect, the often silent Ringo. All emerge as clear characters, but Mr. Emerick never speculates far beyond the bounds of the music studio. You feel his pain when he quits in the middle of the White Album because he can't stand the constant fighting and bickering. The story of recording Band on the Run with Paul and Linda amongst the lizards and bugs is very amusing.  <br />The character who I found most interesting in this book was Mr. Emerick himself. He tells his stories without fanfare or histrionics or gossip mongering. For him, the Beatles were about the music. His job was to devise solutions to assist them in their collective sonic vision. He succeeded.  <br />And he succeeds once again by giving us a straight-forward, unadorned book about his career and making musical history.  <br />Thank you for taking the high road, Mr. Emerick.
068815333X|5.0|Lehane has outdone himself on this one.  Starting with a seemingly sad unconnnected event (the suicide of a client Kenzie only spoke to once, and then forgot to respond to her phone message), Kenzie begins a search for truth.  It will lead him back from the depressive edge of insanity that resulted from the events of 'Gone,Baby,Gone' and once again into the arms of Angela Gennaro (hopefully for good). <br /> <br />What makes these five Boston based mysteries, so amazing, isn't the tight plotting, but it is the detailed descriptions of what his characters do and think.  There are very few throw-away characters, and almost all of them are represented as real people.  The motivation, to present everyone as more than just a shell, is one of the hallmarks of Lehane's writing. <br /> <br />This is a well structured, and even plausible story, that builds to a climax, just when it should, but with Lehane, the ending always takes you back a step, reminding you that there are no fairytale endings.  Your never sure if anyone will live, happily or be the same after it's over. <br />

B000E8QVWY|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" follows the life of country/rock star Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from the genesis of his career in the mid-1950s until his marriage to June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in 1968, as Cash develops his sound, struggles with his own frailties, and rock'n'roll emerges in Memphis against a bland landscape of American music. The film focuses on Cash's personal life and how his music expressed his conflicted personality, but we also see the legendary musicians of Sun Studios under producer Sam Philips: Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, with whom Johnny Cash and Tennessee Three, as well as June Carter, toured the nation. Glimpses of the those musicians evoke the a lifestyle in the early days of touring, when there were no buses, no roadies, and no sleep. I didn't find the film especially sympathetic to Cash's first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), but it is sensitive to June Carter's delicate position as a divorced woman very much in the public eye when divorce was not always acceptable.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon couldn't be better as off-and-on-again lovers Cash and Carter. Phoenix conveys Johnny Cash's eternal struggle to live up his ideals, his darkness, his love of music, and love for June Carter. Reese Witherspoon expresses Carter's commitment to working hard and pleasing her fans, sometimes through difficult circumstances and personal pain. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing, having trained for 3 months under the tutelage of music producer T-Bone Burnett, and they sound great. Musician roles in the film were cast with musicians, which lends some welcome authenticity. Writer and director James Mangold, along with co-writer Gill Dennis, have done a great job of packing a lot of material from the most turbulent period in Johnny Cash's life -and one of the most exciting times in American music- into an entertaining and insightful film. The events of the film are based on Johnny Cash's 2 autobiographies, and he and June Carter had the opportunity to approve the actors who portray them before they passed away in 2003.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer, a soundtrack promotional spot, and an audio commentary by director and co-writer James Mangold. Mangold's commentary is both personal and informative. He provides tidbits of additional historical information, talks about preparing for the film, details of filming, and the film's structure, as well as his conversations with Johnny Cash, his intentions and inspirations, and the film's themes as they reflect Cash's life and personality. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

B000002UAU|5.0|This CD is awesome. From the very first seconds, with the chatter and the orchestra tuning, you know this is going to be great. Every song is different, and quite delightfully random. \\"A Day in the Life\\" is quite possibly one of the Beatles' greatest. \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" is unexpected, and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is a great karaoke song for baby boomers. This is a album with no one weak song that stands out, just one beautiful coherant work.
B000068IEU|1.0|Thank goodness for free rentals at my local video store!!!!!!! I choose to rent this movie as my \\"free\\" rental because I'm such the horror fan and I've heard alot about this movie. This movie should be free to Anyone who rents it! I know this is an old movie and one of Wes Craven's first projects........ thank goodness he's come a long way since then!! Evidentally he had a very low budget to work on with this film. The shooting and acting were terrible. I think my 3 cats could have done better with a hand held cam corder. Anyway, the only good thing about this movie, if you can call it good, is the bloody scenes. I'm quite the gore fan. Other than that, it took everything in me to watch this movie until the end..... but out of curiousity I did. Please don't waste your money on renting this movie.... unless you get it as a free rental and want to kill an hour and a half of your time if you are truly bored to death!
B00004XMV6|4.0|This is quite a quirky film.  On the one hand, there is a passionate sexual relationship that seeks to ever increase excitment, etc. through ever more bizarre games.  In this, it is an affair that is unusual, but not unhealthy in my view as many state here.  On the other hand, there is a serious examination of the two people involved, both of whom are not very good at relationships.  All the reasons for their failures - and the bad mix that they become - is portrayed clearly, and while it isn't appallingly deep, it is a solid novelistic treatment.  So the content is quite good, a slice of life in passionate experimentation that eventually transgresses too many bounds.  I believe it is somewhat of a classic of the genre of deep porn.  Now that I am a middle-aged man and not their age, I still thought it was very good.<br /><br />There is also an artistic backdrop, which appeared a bit stilted to me after 20 years.  The music cut-ins felt a bit contrived, the New York art world - and I was living there at the time and into that world - doesn't appear at all relevant anymore.  I was surprized I felt this way.<br /><br />Interestingly, the film diverges from the book.  Without giving anything away - and this did not happen in the film - at the end the guy just leaves when the woman has a nervous breakdown, their encounters having become the focus of her existence.  He remains distant and never reflects on who he is, what he is doing, or what the woman means to him.<br /><br />Recommended.  It is a bit dated, but there is a lot there.
B000001DVV|4.0|This album is highly entertaining. Good lyrics, good rhymes, funny, catchy tunes, it's got everything. Everytime I listen to it, the world feels like a better place. A real mood uplifter.
B0001WGDXK|4.0|Fifteen years after his death, DG has decided to give us ultra-bargain box sets of Bernstein's late recordings. As is well known, he could be eccentric in this period, often too slow and self-indulgent. Those flaws are at their worst here in the Sibelius Sym. #2 form Vienna and the Elgar from London. But the other Sibelius, particularly Sym. #7, shows real depth of feeling and justifies Bernstein's expressive indulgences. The Four Sea Interludes are moving for being part of the last public concert he gave in Tanglewood with the BSO, and the orchestra plays wonderfully for him. The rest of the performances fall  somewhere in between these extremes. They will all remain controversial, I imagine, but there's a great deal of enjoyment to be had here if you know what you are in for.
B00005JOE8|5.0|V, brillantly acted by Hugo Weaving, is not the story of a terrorist who believes that blowing things up is the only answer.  It is not the story of a person that claims to have all the answers.  It's not the story of a person whose plans are all noble, but the story of a person who wants vengeance, and who sees something horrible in the world and wants to change it.  Violence is not an answer some contractors and critics of the show say.  Violence is not an answer?  Is not AMerica's freedom one by violence?  Did we not liberate a country by blowing up bombs, and sending soldiers with guns.  Do we not have our own Vendettas?<br /><br />V is our second Amendent.  V is to represent the ability all humans, and citizens of a country should have, not to be afraid of their government but for their government to be afraid of them.  If a government has power, you can not beat them in the press.  You can only outrage a public so much that they will join you in a violent overthrow.  Because if you believe a dictator will say that because the masses are quietly and contently protesting that he will resign I pitty, and sad and lost world that will inhabit.  If you believe that Sedition and Censorship are good, and that people who challange the religious ideals, in search of there happiness are bad, then maybe you'd find yourself at home in 2020 Britian.  If you believe that a government shouldn't answer for it's crimes.  That a government doesn't have to answer to it's people.  And that your government can be trusted.  You haven't done your history very well.<br /><br />Hitler, Stalin, 1919 Seditions Act, Containment Centers for the Chinese, Kings, QUeens, Hussien.  This is what blind obedience of your government causes.  Hitler had to be overthrown with violence.  Kings were overthrown, Queens were overthrown, Hussien was overthrown, The Tabliban was overthrown.<br /><br />People might say that this praises anarchy.  Anarchy is chaos, because we believe that people cannot be trusted.  People given freedom will be corrupted by that freedom, and for the most part it is true.  But I can only hope that the world, given a choice between, Censorsip and Sedition, Controling Government, Dictatorship, the Dissmissal of privacy, and the dissmisal of freedom, or Anarcy, people Anarchy.  Let me remind you of a woman named Margaret Garner, who instead of allowing her babies to be taken back for slavery, she murdered them.  Let me remind you of Nat Turner, who was hung, was tried and found guilty, who led a revolt against the government of the South because it wasn't right.  Benjamin Franklin once said that \\"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\\"  And that is the case we deal with in V's world.  It is safer to live under the governments rule and not fight, and not argue, and not do anything.  It is safer... but freedom is not meant to be safe.  Freedom means death, freedom means murder and hate, freedom means love and expression, freedoms danger and uncertainty, and freedom means Power and Individuality.<br /><br />V isn't a coward because he hides behind a mask, he's deformed for one reason, and he's trying to last longer than the man who thought there would be no punishment.  Anarchist and a Terrorist, you know, I wonder what people think America is in Iraq, the Iraqi citizens whose children have been firebombed, whose mothers have been burnt to death, or whose fathers or husband or wives or grandparents, or grandchildren have been killed by American bombs.  Or these people who have been left defenseless against the Tyranny that still exist as we try to force our views down their throats, and the voice of opposition is continually silenced.  If all of a sudden, ten thousand people Marched down Iraqi streets, we would lose this war completely.  If they stood together, if they chose to no longer allow us we would be the enemy.  WE aren't yet, but that's luck.  V united a peoplein his time against a true evil.  An evil the people came to accept for fear of death.  Not realizing that without the tolls of death, civilization will cease to exist.nited a people in his time against a true evil.  An evil the people came to accept for fear of death.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|David Gilmour is my favorite guitar player, but I was very disappointed with this cd. All the songs are too mellow. So mellow in fact, that you could fall asleep listening to it! I was hoping for at least one song that rocked, but there were none! Others may say broaden your horizons, but I can listen to any kind of music except Rap (Which really isn't music anyhow). If I wanted to listen to sleep music I would have bought Nat King Cole, not David Gilmour! Nothing like his other two releases. No wonder it only costs $10.00. I was very surprised when I saw that price and now I know why!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was very pleased to have this dvd pop up as one I might be interested in while I was reading about another favorite of mine ('Persuasion' with Amanda Root).  With so many great reviews, I knew I had to get it.  Thank you to everyone who took the time to write reviews.  The story has several similarities to Pride and Prejudice, but it truly has original elements.  I did not feel any impatience with parallels between the two.  All the actors were perfect for their roles.   They all brought grace and intelligence to their roles.   No overblown theatrics...these actors make Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in 'Emma' look heavy-handed and artificial.  Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret is luminous and intelligent--never annoying.   She is sincere about wanting to understand her new town and its residents.  And Richard Armitage is the most appealing actor I have ever watched anywhere!  I never have had a crush on an actor.  I do now!  He is so compelling to watch.  I agree with the other reviewers who state that he just might have topped the terrific Colin Firth in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice.   Richard Armitage has formidable talent and charisma, and I hope more movies and productions feature him.  I put the dvd in and watched it straight through with no pauses to eat dinner, even though I hadn't eaten all day.  It was that wonderful.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Is it possible for a film to get better and better with repeated viewings? I originially caught Pride and Prejudice in the theaters when released, and was surprisingly delighted at the adaptation presented before me. Then, I promptly forgot it with the Caoptes and Brokeback Mountains of the world. Upon it's release on DVD, I absolutely fell in love with this movie, and again and again, and now regard it as a mere masterpiece; a cinematic feast.<br /><br />I'm not an Austen purest. In fact, I shudder to admit on Amazon.com that I have not even read her. So any comparison of the book to the movie would be lost on me. I also have not witnessed the BBC comprehensive version of Pride, to which many compare this movie. So the disruptive ending of the movie, which sometimes seems to upset the Austen purests, and the wonderful performance of Colin Firth, which dominates the BBC version, are unknown to me. I watch this with virgin eyes.<br /><br />And of course, I delight in what I see. A story of a young woman, one of four girls, destined in early 1800's England to marry, but with strong will and mind of her own. She bristles against the bristle-y Mr. Darcy, hard edged, unsocial (much like me, minus the money), and like flint and steel, tremendously spark and start a fire which burns through the film, brightly, intensely, passionately. The moments of confrontation, and lack thereof, between Elizabeth and Darcy are juicy, palpable, and true, and thus drive this plot honestly.<br /><br />The performances astound. I've caught all of the leading actress roles this year, and I must say, Kiera Knightly's performance ranks as superior. She is the film; simply put. Should another actress play Elizabeth, the film would have lost its soulforce. By all rights, she should have marched up to the stage to claim her reward (possibly only surpassed by the comparable Felicity Huffman's role in Transamerica). In turn, Matthew Macfadyen's harsh Mr. Darcy melts before our eyes and on the screen before Elizabeth, and the glacial melt is amazing. Where was his nomination? Supporting actors Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn were born to play Elizabeth's honest, supportive parents. And Tom Hollander as the bumbling, ill-fated suitor Mr. Collins almost steals the movie with his comic pathos. Fine performances from all.<br /><br />Adding to this mix, Joe Wright's amazing, amazing, amazing direction. Most of the film's enjoyment comes from his camera placement and work. Just watch the scene at the second party, where the camera moves throughout the party, and manages to tell several parts of the story seemlessly at once. Wright tells on the commentary how it took hours to set up the shot; the results impress and delight. He shaped this movie, which could have been another bland period piece, into something rich, delightful, multi-layered, and dare I say.... modern?<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is a film that in many years, people will be popping into their video players of the future; to study fine filmmaking, to learn from solid performances, to watch young love, and to enjoy the exploits of Elizabeth and Darcy, their machinations of love, and the persistance of desire.<br /><br />Bravo!screen before Elizabeth, and the glacial melt is amazing.

0780631684|5.0|Four friends are going to Paris for a class field trip.  While on the plane, a guy named Billy has a premonition of the plane exploding.  When he wakes up, he warns his friends of what he saw.  He makes a scene on the plane, and gets himself and three of his friends kicked off the plane.  When outside, the four see the plane take off and EXPLODE.  From then on, the people who didn't die in the crash (the four who escape the plane), they die one by one in mysterious ways throughout the movie.  the deaths are disgusting and unrealistic.  Overall, I thought this was a good movie to watch, but if you are the faint at heart, then I recommend you not watch it.  I love this stuff, but some parts I had to cover my eyes.
0195067142|5.0|WWII is one of my favorite reading topics, but even having read many books detailing the unbelievable brutality and savagery of combat in the war, Mr. Sledge's memoirs of the battles he was in at Peleliu and Okinawa were painful to read. The weather and terrain alone would have been an extreme hardship, but the combat was so brutal and unrelenting that it's a miracle that anyone survived. The Japanese would not surrender - they had to be killed to the last man, and this took an enormmous toll in casualties by the Marines and Army forces. Mr. Sledge does a great job of describing in detail what it was like to be there.<br /><br />The photographs are printed on plain paper, and the maps could have been a little better, but those are very minor complaints.<br /><br />If you have any interest in WWII combat in the Pacific, this book should be on your reading list.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It is for anyone who likes a movie that is thought provoking.  The cast is great and the acting is phenomenal.  You will especially enjoy this movie if you loved the whole vibe of the 80's, I know I did.
6303314015|5.0|<br />     This happens to be an awesome movie! I don't have the 2 disc dvd but I just have the old vhs but I love the anime on the lions and the other animals. It starts at a kingdom of the Pridelands where all kinds of jungle animals live. The king is a proud and kind hearted lion named Mufasa. And his son Simba is looking to be just like Mufasa. Brave and strong. Although the law says once a king dies his son takes his place. Simba also has a friend named Nyla. Just as everything goes great Mufasa's brother Scar kills Mufasa (No blood or stuff like that, this movie is safe for little kids) Simba runs away when Scar made it look like Simba killed Mufasa. Scar becomes a wrong hearted king at the pridelands and Simba find these two crazy animals who raise him fairly and when Simba grown up runs into Nyla she tells him theres no food or water from what Scar's done to the pridelands. Simba is too worried to tell her about Mufasa's death. But Simba soon knows he must go back and take place as king. When he does he defeats Scar and he follows in his father's paw prints and saves the pridelands. <br />                                You must buy it! <br />                                It's awesome!

B000850IHW|5.0|Free Hand was Gentle Giant's first album aimed squarely, song-for-song, at what was then known as Album-Oriented Rock radio -- a concerted attempt to reach a wider audience without sacrificing any of the band's brilliantly unique qualities. And they pulled it off beautifully. \\"Just the Same,\\" \\"Free Hand\\" and \\"Time to Kill\\" are GG at their most fun (the female backing vocals on \\"Time to Kill\\" never fail to make me smile). \\"His Last Voyage\\" is as hauntingly beautiful as any of Kerry Minnear's songs, one that I'd be very happy to hear on my death bed. The live version of \\"Just the Same,\\" added to this release, brings back great memories of Bicentennial weekend in Rochester, NY, when any doubts I had that the band could actually play this stuff live were gloriously smashed to bits (I believe this song was the show-opener).<br /><br />Two small quibbles -- the studio tracks on my legally DL'ed mp3 version suffer from attenuated high frequencies, which make the music sound a bit sterile. Perhaps the master tape was EQ'ed for transfer to vinyl, but a little treble boost on the user end brings it back to life. Second, if there's a weak track on the album it's \\"Mobile,\\" which lapses into a sing-song quality that hints at some of the more mind-numbing romps in GG albums to come. Whether that's intentional or not I never found it particularly enjoyable.<br /><br />I'd argue that Free Hand is the band's last truly great studio album, and the one that would have set the music world on its ear if only AOR music directors had given it a chance. It's definitely the album I'd recommend to a newbie who wanted to \\"acquire the taste.\\"
0684824906|5.0|With all the volumes written about Abraham Lincoln, you'd think that writers would be running out of material.  But Doris Kearns Goodwin gives us a new angle on Lincoln with her new book, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.  While Goodwin's books cover weighty matters, she always writes in an easy to read style and Team of Rivals is truly an awesome book.<br /><br />Goodwin opens with the Republican Convention of 1860 that took place in Chicago.  Here, Lincoln receives the nomination for president.  This came as a complete surprise to most-especially the three men who considered themselves the frontrunners and more worthy for the job.  These three were William H. Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates.  In the first third of Team of Rivals, Goodwin recounts the backgrounds of the four men and how their paths eventually and fatefully converged at Chicago.  While most felt that Lincoln fell into the nomination, the author details the brilliant plotting by Lincoln and his friends that secured his presidential bid.<br /><br />Once elected, one of the first things Lincoln does is to select his cabinet.  Those very men that he beat out for the presidency are chosen for these key positions.  Seward becomes Secretary of State, Chase becomes Treasury Secretary and Bates Attorney General.  His reasoning was that with the slave crisis threatening the country, he needed the strongest men surrounding him.  Goodwin writes \\"That Lincoln, after winning the presidency made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of a profound self-confidence and a first indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness.\\"  At first, the three men thought that they would be able to control Lincoln.  But it quickly became apparent that not only was Lincoln his own man, but that he \\"would emerge as the strongest of them all.\\"  Goodwin also spends much time discussing Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, and to a lesser extent, Gideon Welles, Simon Cameron and Montgomery Blair.  Despite underestimating Lincoln from the start, these men all came to love, respect and revere Lincoln (perhaps with the exception of Chase who never stopped desiring the presidency for himself).  Through it all, Lincoln was the glue that held the cabinet (and the country) together with his intellect, his instincts, and his common decency.  As his secretary John Hay said, \\"There is no man in the country, so wise so gentle and so firm.  I truly believe the hand of God placed him where he is.\\"<br /><br />I was fascinated to learn more about the contributions of these cabinet members, especially Seward and Stanton.  Seward became Lincoln's closest friend and confident, and was invaluable as Secretary of State.  Stanton's handling of the war was brilliant.  When the War Secretary wanted the job of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1864, Lincoln couldn't bear to lose his talents.  Goodwin accesses little used documents to flesh out her story, including thousands of letters and diaries of the Seward, Bates, Chase, Blaire and Stanton families.  They provide us with a fresh look at the Lincoln administration and the war years.<br /><br />While Team of Rivals is a very impressive work, two additions would have been helpful.  First, a list of cabinet members and their assistants would have helped the reader.  Sometimes it was hard to keep them all straight.  Also, while Goodwin provides prodigious footnotes, she does not include a bibliography.<br /><br />Goodwin received a Pulitzer for No Ordinary Time, and Team of Rivals has already been given the Lincoln Award.  I'm sure that this book will receive a number of other well-deserved awards.Edwin Stanton, and to a lesser extent, Gideon Welles, Simon Cameron and Montgomery Blair.

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I was never into television music soundtracks until I got into BSG. The music for this show is not only well composed, but very powerful. It's half the reason why I watch the show. It evokes great emotion in every scene of the show, telling a story within itself.<br /><br />The Celtic, Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern, African and faint Flamenco rhythms, heavy tribal and military drums, and haunting flutes and Native American influenced chanting blend together seamlessly for track after track of powerful music. McCreary does himself proud, having such a good grip on so many different musical sounds and rhythms, and bringing them together so profoundly. If you like Battlestar Galactica, I assure you, half the show is the music, which is why the soundtrack is a must-have.
B000002GFC|5.0|The Very Best of Cream is a must have for any Cream fan, this album showcases the versitility of a trio of musicians who, joined together for such a short time but concieved some titles that still sound fresh today. This is Eric Clapton,Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce at their best,with all their greatest hits.

B00005JO1R|5.0|I loved it!  I too believe that Joaquin Phoenix deserved the best actor Oscar along with Reese Witherspoon.  It would have been my selection for Best Picture too.  <br /> <br />I find myself replaying the DVD just so I can listen to the music becuase 'Times A'wastin' and 'I've got stripes' are not on the soundtrack CD. <br /> <br />A comment from an earlier reviewer mentioned the obvious wigs that Reese wore in the move.  It made me remember that in the late 60's and early seventies we all wore wigs and some were pretty tacky. I think we called them falls and we added them to our own hair to make it look fuller.  <br /> <br />I thought Ginnifer Goodwin did a great job too. I did not see her role as a bitter wife.  She, like many other women in those days, was very frustrated, often pregnant and had few choices.  She was caught in a bad space with no where to go. The story took place before the women's movement took off in the seventies.
B0000024TT|5.0|One of the un-sung geniouses of the our time (and the sixties)....this is his premier album, and one I have worn out several times...glad to finally have it on CD!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Avoid this crappy music at any cost. Madonna should never enter the music seen. My ears bleed everytime her song comes up on the radio. Ban this talentless woman.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This Cd is one of the best ever put out by Shakira. Almost every song on here is excellent, especially En Tus Pupilas, La Pared, La Tortura, and No. These songs really show off how great Shakira's voice is, and if you think her voice is awful, what do you think is great? Whichever member ranked this Cd with a zero, and said her voice is terrible obviously has no taste in music because he ranked a Britney spears Cd with a five! I think he got confused and meant to give Shakira a five, and Spears a Zero!
0553801503|3.0|This was worth reading. I don't know if it was worth waiting for. It's a middle book, a transition book, and it shows. The characters are excellent, as usual, and that is where all the enjoyment comes from: Brienne and Jaime on their separate journies, Sansa and Arya on their own journeys to adulthood, Cersei and her downward spiral.<br /><br />There are other new stories, too, some of which only last for a chapter or so. Several chapters seem utterly pointless, unfortunately. I suppose if they'd been cut, the general theme of the novel might not have been as strong, but as it is, I don't even know if it was an intended theme: How Oppressing Women Screws Countries Up.<br /><br />Cersei, denied the right to inherit, is eaten by her ambition. A Dornish princess desperately protects her own right to inherit, walking down a treacherous road as she does. A seafaring princess tries to take the power she'd inherit if she were male, and fails, potentially splitting her people. A lot of angry, bitter women use every tool at their disposal to prove they're the equal to men.<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure if all those parallels were intentional. It's the first sign I've seen of that kind of theme in all four books. It'd be cool if it was meaningful in future books-- prophecy says a Queen is coming, after all. Will all the other wanna-be queens rally behind her? Will they even notice? Will the the prophecied Queen bring social change?<br /><br />--but I don't really expect it to be meaningful. Still, even if it was unintended, it does at least tie the book together.<br /><br />Expect cliffhangers at the end, and tears when the story picks up again.
6305949980|5.0|I'd give this movie five stars for the music alone. Especially the \\"Oogie Boogie\\" song--Ken Page has an awesome voice. (He even did the video for CATS!!!!!) Tim Burton co-wrote the script and did an awesome job. The actors are incredible, the animation was perfect, and Danny Elfman writes the best scores! I'd definitely say that this is a good holiday movie--for Halloween OR Christmas!  <br /> <br />Just a little warning though: some parts are a little scary--like the \\"Oogie Boogie\\" sequence, or when Jack Skellington describes Santa Claus as \\"Sandy Claws\\".

B0000024W3|5.0|My father always said this was a great dance album. Have you ever experienced a beatiful girl dancing at a Dylan show? If you have, you will know what I mean. My father was never disappointed about anything. He lived until he was pleased.

B000006NPY|2.0|After their smashing success with \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" which followed the even better \\"Siamese Dream,\\" Billy Corgan and his bandmates, proceeding without the benefit of the band's unfortunately drug addicted drummer (Jimmy Chamberlin), decided to completely change directions with \\"Adore.\\"  Simply put, \\"Adore\\" doesn't compare to the preceding albums (the two above-mentioned plus \\"Gish\\") and, at times, plods along so slowly, that it's difficult to listen to in one sitting, unless it has put you to sleep.  While I particularly like the song \\"Appels & Oranjes,\\" and think that \\"To Sheila\\" and \\"Blank Page\\" are okay, I'm really mystified by all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  It's not that I don't like mellow songs from the band (there are quite of few of these in the first three albums that I like alot) it's just that most of these songs lack warmth and leave no impression at all.  Ask yourself this question:  would you even give \\"Adore\\" the time of day if it were by some unknown band as opposed to The Smashing Pumpkins?    The fact is that after eagerly awaiting for three years the follow up to \\"Mellon Collie,\\" the lackluster \\"Adore\\" bored fans and critics alike (despite what reviewers say here).  The Smashing Pumpkins, on the verge of being considered one of the greatest rock bands in the world, perhaps on the level of U2, basically fell off the map.  If you don't believe me, look at the horrendous sales of their next album, \\"Machina/The Machines of God,\\" (a superior album to \\"Adore\\") which led to the break-up of the band.    Footnote: The last song \\"17,\\" and the poem of that name on back of the liner notes, are Billy's tribute to one of his favorite bands, The Cure, whose second album is called \\"Seventeen Seconds\\" (compare \\"17\\" to \\"The Sound\\" from that Cure album).  Come to think of it, some of \\"Adore\\" reminds me of latter-day Cure -- just not nearly as good.  If the Pumpkins ever decide to re-unite, I highly doubt their concerts will feature many \\"Adore\\" songs.

B000002J3W|5.0|Nothing like the self titled \\"Skid Row\\" release of 1989 and \\"Subhuman Race\\" is even harder than the 1991 album \\"Slave to the Grind\\". It is really too bad that the record labels were dumping \\"grunge\\" and \\"alternative\\" hype on the public in the `90s so everyone basically ignored this album thinking it was just another \\"hair band\\" release. If it was actually given a chance, this may have actually saved Skid Row from virtual obscurity today. <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, this album could go toe to toe with any of Metallica's releases in recent times and even thrash them out of the water while reminding Metallica that the term \\"Heavy Metal\\" starts with the word \\"HEAVY\\". <br /> <br />In my opinion, after this album; it is truly unfair to continue to describe Skid Row using bands such as Warrant, Mr. Big, Poison or other `80s hair or glam bands as references.  <br />

B000025XKM|5.0|Nick Drake's Pink Moon is roughly thirty minutes long. It's worth can't be measured in minutes. How does one measure the pure poetry of a young man's last stand. Time can't reflect a sadness darker than the deepest sea. A lone voice and single guitar have never said more. Pink Moon is timeless...
B000000993|5.0|Undertow is one of those albums you should listen to now and again...especially if you have gotten hung up on Lateralus or Aenima, etc. Of course, if you don't own a copy yet, well, then get one. In a sense it's easy to forget how good it is, I actually get a little homesick for it on occasion and dust it off and have another inspection. The music is just so clean, so uncomplicated as other Tool albums. \\"Crawl Away\\" is a perfect example of this. Probably the top draw would be \\"Sober\\" and not for poor reasoning...it bleeds from the same vein as the band's other revocations of religious dogma. \\"Prison Sex\\" is likely my favorite of the bunch. Not only is it a great rocker (like the title track - \\"Undertow\\") but it could speak as well for the innocent as the next serial killer. Like Jim Morrison might have had a say in this, \\"...we could plant a murder...or start a religion.\\"  <br />Again let me state, it is easy to forget how clean and unsullied the sound is...crisp and driving, yeah, that's the word - driving. Gotta give it 5 stars. Looking forward to May when the new release is expected! <br />Oh, also keep in mind our ancestoral history. At some point in antiquity along our evolutionary path, there had to be a first...the very first artist who lay in his cro-magnan cave and decided for whatever aesthetic impulse to fling wooly mammoth crap at his cave wall. Along came a visitor who beheld this creation. Along came the critic.  <br />
B0000067L2|5.0|This album brought Cream to the top in 1967. While their debut was a great album on its own, this sophomore effort is in my opinion the band's finest hour. On this record, the trio of Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton approaches variety of genres like Psychodelia, Classic Blues, Rock and many more with perfection. Many songs from this album are longtime Cream classics and stand as a principle of the band's repertoire. <br /> <br />Disraeli Gears saw the trio growing as the musicans. The songwiritng has improved a lot since Fresh Cream and the songs sound a lot more sophisticated and inspired. Unlike on the band's debut, most of the songs are originals written by band's members and there are only two covers to be found (Outside Woman Blues, Mother's Lament) <br /> <br />The album opens with Strange Brew, straight-up blues with a recognizable guitar lick. A good opener. Sunshine Of Your Love, arguably Cream's biggest hit, follows next. This classic opens with a fierce guitar riff and features a legendary guitar solo. Every band member shines on this number. But even if it's the major hit, it's far from being the only one great song on here. World Of Pain and Dance The Night Away deliver some colorful psychedelia, and Blue Condition is a nice relaxing blues track. The giant Tales Of Brave Ulysess follows next. This track features a superb guitar riff and some psychodelic poetry written by Martin Sharp. The use of wah-wah is a great addition. Definately an inspired and amazing track, one of my personal favourites. SWLABR (She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow), an intense rocker, never fails to please. Catchy lyrics and guitar riff will get stuck in your head once You hear it. Outside Woman Blues delivers some more classic blues playing. Take It Back follows similar stylings, and some harmonica is to be found here as well. The closing Mother's Lament is more a joke song, and though most reviewers seem to dislike it, I think it's a nice closer. Cream is not only aboutbeing seriously, and they show it on this track. <br /> <br />Disraeli Gears is not only Cream's finest record, it's also one of the major classics of the 60s. It is as influental as Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\", The Doors' debut album or The Beatles' \\"Sergeant Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band\\". If You call Yourself a classic rock fan, this is a must have. And If You want to get into Cream, this is the best place to start. Highly Recommended.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Ive never been a lips fan though i did like about half of the Soft Bulletin album. Yoshimi on the other hand is a very cool and consistent record. Do you realize is a perfect pop song though beyond the usual subject matter(death). I never get sick of repeated listens of this record though im not a fan of track 3 and 4. Not many records pass this test but this one does. It seems oddly invigorating despite being centered around themes of death and mortality. Alittle electronic-symphonic pop- pyschedelia-indie and rock make this the lips first classic atleast to me. But the forthcoming At war with the mystics comes out in a few weeks and i heard some great tracks on a preview show so they might even better this very essential addition to your cd collection. One small minor complaint at times the production sounds thin with all the electronic treatments and drum machines but thats about it.

B00009P1O2|5.0|Hey Amazonians, as the tag line indicates, I'm not a massive, gotta have it, fan of Queen BUT I do really love their music. I'm not even sure that a review is really required because if your like me, you either want to see Queen in concert our you don't.  <br /> <br />Since this is the space where I'm supposed to go to actually write a review, I will. Overall: Excellent. I really, really enjoyed the DVD concert. The stage was massive. The songs where classic. The pace was excellent.  <br /> <br />There were also a BUNCH of song's I had never heard of (casual fan, remember?) and those ranged from soulful, melodic and beautifal ballads to rip-snortin rockers.  <br /> <br />It was like a box of choclates; You never know what you will find, but you know you like choclates.  <br /> <br />Freddy was a pro. I never did see them live and I'm still kicking myself. This was as close as I got and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />I found this DVD to be an excellent enterainment bargin.  <br /> <br />P.S. Call an old friend today and tell them you love them. Joy to the world.

B0000VD04M|4.0|A loving tribute to Bela Lugosi and fifties Sci-Fi, I liked thim movie even more the second time.  The first time, I laughed along with everyone.  But the second time, I realized that the film doesn't really poke fun at Ed Wood.  Instead, in a way, in reveres him and Hollywood in the fifties. <br /> <br />Landau is perfect in a very sympathetic portrayal of Bela Lugosi.  It's amazing how Burton and Landau were able to, quite literally, resurrect Lugosi from the grave.  If you like Lugosi, you'll LOVE this movie.  Tim Burton treats him with respect and I appreciated his approach very much.  Ditto for Ed Wood.  The movie doesn't really laugh AT Ed Wood.  Not at all.  And that's what makes this such a great film.   <br /> <br />The music is utterly fantastic.  Unfortunately, the DVD sound mixing leaves much to be desired!  The music actually drowns out the dialogue!!!  It's mixed TOO LOUD and spoils the film in parts. <br /> <br />Also, the so-called \\"Special Edition\\" contains no audio commentary nor deleted scences despite the advertizing on the box.  I found this to be VERY irritating and disappointing.  If I had bought it, I would have taken it back and demanded a refund.  Fortunately, I was able to rent it for just a dollar and enjoyed it immensely.  So buyers beware.  Great rental but I wouldn't want to own it due to the defects I just mentioned.

0345457684|5.0|The basic idea behind these books is you can store the current state of your mind to a computer disk, so that when you die, you can be put into a new body.  I think Morgan does a good job of thinking out and addressing all the implications of that kind of society.  Things like, where do the new bodies come from?  What advantages do the oldest people have?  What groups is the technology not available to?  What if you download into more than one body? <br />The plot of the book is basically a conspiracy/murder mystery.  I think Morgan could have been more detailed in his explanation of how Kovacs gained the insight to solve the mystery, but that is my only complaint about the book.  Very fun sci-fi, and reads quick.

1573225517|4.0|\\"High Fidelity\\" is Nick Hornby's first novel and was first published in 1995. It was later adapted for the big screen and starred John Cusak, Jack Black and Lisa Bonet. (The film was set in Chicago, though, rather than London).  <br />  <br />The story is told by Rob Fleming, the thirty-something owner of a record shop called \\"Championship Vinyl\\". The shop, he claims, specialises in catering for the `serious' record collector - unfortunately, if sales are anything to go by, there aren't too many serious record collectors left. He is a bit of a trainspotter when it comes to music and his own record collection - which he tends to reorganise in times of emotional stress. His staff consists of the somewhat obnoxious Barry and the slightly nerdy Dick (one of the book's more likeable characters). Barry thinks and talks largely in lists - his top five Dustin Hoffman movies or the top ten albums made by blind musicians, for example - and it's a trait that Rob seems to have picked up to a degree. As the book opens, Rob has just been dumped by his girlfriend and he begins with his top five dumpings. (Rob has always, it seems, been the dumpee, rather than the dumper). Laura, the girlfriend who provided him with his most recent dumping, doesn't make the list.  <br />  <br />The book sees Rob trying to work through his post-dumping traumas. He knows he hasn't been innocent and blameless, but that doesn't make the split any easier to deal with. The highs and lows include Marie LaSalle (an American folk-country singer on a small independent label and the focus of a post-breakup crush) and a phone call from one of Laura's friends, who mentions that she doesn't think much of `this Ian guy'. Unfortunately, Rob hadn't known anything about `this Ian guy'. It's something that sends him into a horrible `what-does-it-all-mean' routine that sees him attempting to contact the five women on his top five dumping list.  <br />  <br />One of the professional reviewers that sometimes gets blurbed - Elizabeth Young, from the Guardian - mentioned that \\"the most frequent response to High Fidelity is `Oh God, I know people just like that!'.\\" She's not too far off the mark - at times (though thankfully, not all the time) the person I knew who was just like that...was me. While it may make you squirm at times, it is also a very funny book and is absolutely recommended.

B00004RF9B|5.0|This is the one. The movie that was the inspiration for Star Trek and Lost in Space. It is all here, in this 1956 masterpiece. A commander with a soft spot for beautiful girls, his friends, the doctor and the science officer, The saucer shaped starship, the weapons that vaporize their targets (here called blasters, not phasers) and the friendly talking robot. But Forbidden Planet goes where its imitations never gone before. Its is a wonderful movie and have not lost its magic in all these years
1592401791|1.0|Thank you Geoff Emerick for a very entertaining fantasy read.  As an avid Beatle fan I couldn't believe most of what I read as being true.  I frequently had to check the facts of the book and repeatedly found errors. Simply listen to the outtakes contained on bootleg Beatle albums.  It's sad that someone so close to the Fab Four couldn't pull it together and tell an honest factual story from the \\"inside\\".  Maybe he should've written it when he had a valid memory or maybe it was easier for him to wait so long and plead \\"senior moments\\" so that he could sensationalize the story. For those readers who want a lot of fluff from what appears to be a very bitter, angry and sometimes confused <br />former EMI employee, wait for the paperback version and take it to the beach this summer.  Not worth the paper it's written on.    <br /> <br />
B00005JOE8|4.0|RATING SCALE:  <br />(From 0, being none, to 10, being extreme) <br />Sex and nudity: 4 <br />Profanity Use: 5 <br />Violence and Gore: 6 <br /> <br />I can only describe 2006's first amazing movie best by one of the scenes that appears in the movie: <br /> <br />The hero/ \\"terrorist\\", V, is surrounded by gunmen and a parliment official. They fire at him with machine guns until every single bullet out of every single gun penetrates V, which is quite a many of bullets. V falls to the ground, gathers his breath, and stands up. he then proceeds, one by one, to take out the gunmen in the most stylized, elegant, and powerful fight scenes of the whole movie. V kills all but one, the parliment official. The man shoots at V and when his bullets run out, V slams him up against a wall. The man asks \\"Why won't you die?\\" in which V responds: <br /> <br />\\"Underneath this mask, there is molten flesh, under that flesh, there is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.\\" <br /> <br />Perfectly stated, this movie is bulletproof. From its powercharged beginning until the last 10 minutes of cinema glory and sheer, heart pounding adrenaline that is packed into a magnificent, visually stunning close, \\"v For Vendetta\\" provokes, shocks, both visually and morally, and ultimately provides some of the greatest and most beautiful scenes of imagery ever created in action movies. <br /> <br />V For Vendetta takes place in Britain in 2020. The citizens are under a totalitarian government and are forced to do, think, and speak whatever the government tells them. However, there is a restless, relentless man, whom is known to officials as a \\"terrorist\\" that is determined to bring freedom to Britain through any means possible. Codenamed \\"V\\", the masked hero uncovers to a female comrad the horrendous past he has suffered through and the uncompromising future he sees for Britain.  <br /> <br />Everyone who I had gone to the movies with to see this film was absolutly blown away. Though the plot begins to become very slow for about 30 minutes, it kicks back up in a rampage of action, a hailstorm of a story, and, underneath it all, a powerful message to tell people now what can be in a mere few years. Throughout the movie news reports report the devestation that has rocked America, from war to plague, and fear the same happening to Britain.  <br /> <br />V For Vendetta plays its one of a kind script so well, so amazingly, and so elegantly, while at the same time, so bad-assly, that it soars you through emotions, and invokes you to the bitter end. Give this movie all of your power and attention, because underneath its stylized action, there is a great, powerful message. A plot so well crafted, an absolute beauty in the way it has been produced, that you will leave the theater impowered with such a rush, that this movie will become something talked about for years to come.
0143036556|5.0|First, i like the book. Unlike some of the amazon reviewers, i am even attracted to the few places that Diamond lets his personality and personal feelings show. For that reason i recommend reading the 1st Chapter, labelled \\"under Montana's Big Sky\\" for an idea if you will like this book, for it is the most the author has shown of himself in either this book or Guns, Germs and Steel. I appreciate his passion, which in his science he keeps rather hidden, although it is certainly what keeps him moving and what makes him write books.<br /><br />Second, i am interested in the topic. Broadly speaking he tries to link past ecological diasters with the very high level things people think about: values, political structure, social networks, the meaning of history. Now he does this in much smaller steps, but that is the big picture: how values help some communities cope with a changing environment (often something they actually caused) thus either failing to cope or even survive or meeting the challenge. As one reviewer wrote, this is reminisent of A.Toynbee.<br /><br />Third, the idea that people are responsible for environmental changes is a big social-political hot potato in our times. Just a brief scan of the reviews will show that this is a polarizing issue. Diamond's desire is to defuse the conversation, take it to a dispassionate scientific realm where we can discuss the issues without getting so overheated. I appreciate this and think to an amazing extent he is successful. Part of the way he does this is to both integrate and to separate description and prescription in the book. It appears that the book is about 50-50 by volume *grin*, with most prescription concentrated in the later chapters. But he doesn't completely separate the two, the sections on two oil companies, first part of chapter 15 is probably the best example of mixing description with prescription, and the reasons for good environmental controls. That is another section high on the list of must reads for the insightfulness on the problems.<br /><br />Fourth, he presents the big 5 criteria of factors in environmental collapse, pg 11: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trading partners, society's responses. Uses it pretty consistently throughout the book, it has enough value to add the list to my mental toolbox. The book is, on the highest levels, about society's responses, in particular in very high level principles like value changes due to underlying environmental changes, so that the 5 principles build up to the last one, they are accumulative.<br /><br />It's a big book, addressed to the mythic average intelligent layman who reads nearly 600 page books about Easter Island deforestation, Greenland Inuits vs Norseman, and about birds in the Western Pacific. About 1/3 of the book is about the data, about easter island-Chapter 2, pitcairn island-3, anasazi-4 (i live in tucson, i paid more attention here, *grin*), maya-5, vikings-6, greenland-7 flowering, greenland-8 the end, chapter 9-top down vs bottom up environmental protection, some successes, some failures.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Wow...ok, so you love Pablo Honey 'cause it tells you stories. You whack the window of the airplane you are on in life with The Bends. You are hooked to OK Computer because you wonder why is it such a departure from what you have heard before. And with Kid A-Amesiac you are about to take some sleeping pills...when you realize that you don't know How to disappear completelely (and not be found). Then, political satire? What...? I really like Hail to The Thief. I think the press was absolutely right, it's like like a mo-Pablo honey. It paints pictures for you although I still guessing what \\"The Gloamings\\" picture is...genocide? You have got to realize that this album was made before the shock and aw of Iraq. It was obvious. I love this album, I think it reminds us all that even when you have messed up, had a bad day or what have you; it could have been worse. Do you know right from wrong? In a flood, (missiles like cobwebs in the sky) will you build an arch and sail us to the moon? I was trying to be funny. The best way to discribe this album is poltical satire with a melancoly cheering up.  Buy this album absolutely, even if you are not a radiohead fanatic (like so many of us), not because Thom Yorke makes 5 cents, buy it because you will love this album.

B000002UE2|4.0|This is a fine live album that really conveys the way a truly great band can share music with the audience, rather than merely presenting music to the audience. I simply don't understand reviewers who say the band sounds tired and routine.  <br /> <br />As a performing musician myself, I don't know if I could inject that much energy into a show after so many years of touring. Playing music live is much like performing live as a comedian--the trick is to perform each and every time as if it was the first time you were in front of an audience. After all, many in the audience may be seeing you for the first time, so they are expecting to hear you at your best. This is Grand Funk Railroad at their live best. <br /> <br />When a band gets tired, the singing and especially the harmonies are usually the first thing to go. The singing and harmony here are inspired! The CD mastering sounds like it may have sucked some energy out of the performance (I haven't heard the original vinyl), but GFR clearly put an immense amount of energy into it. <br /> <br />To me, the litmus test for a live album is whether or not it makes me wish I had been there, and that is definitely the case with Caught In The Act.  <br /> <br />Just don't forget to play it LOUD! <br />

B00005JOE8|4.0|I was in the middle of writing a long, long review for this, but it sucked, sucked, sucked, so I'll try for something short.  So here it is: 'V for Vendetta' is a sharp, good-looking and solidly crafted, I dunno, action-thriller-sci-fi kinda thing.  It's far from 100% faithful to the comic, but it's closer than I'd anticipated, and manages to par things down into a more cohesive narrative.  This comes at the cost of some ideas, yes, which is too bad, but it's a necessary evil and doesn't come with out some benefits.  Personally, I thought the comic was a bit too meandering and lacked sufficient narrative thrust.  That's bound to be a problem much of the time, considering the format, but it's was worse then it needed be.  Still, some good stuff is lost.  I particularly miss V's affinity for anarchy:  Here they really make no mention of this, with the only vestige remaining being his V symbol, which is, of course, a circled anarchy 'A' turned upside down, minus the line across.  He opposes the current government, yes, but there's no discussion of what he'd replace it with.<br /><br />This was written and produced by the Wachowskis, so yes it's got some Matrix-isms, but fewer then plenty of other films, and the dialogue is rarely, though still occasionally, painful.  The action scenes are generally nicely done; I particularly like the one towards the end, which features many slow motion gouts of blood.  So many action movies are tragically bloodless...  The film looks great, creating a plausible near-future Britain  that manages to be very cold and distant without seeming to far removed from reality.  Performances are solid all around, with particular kudos going to Weaving as V.  He's most notable for the fact that his character is simply believable and not utterly ridiculous.  It would've been very easy for him to come across as such.  Portman is acceptable as Evey, and while the performance is hardly stunning there's really nothing wrong with it. (Just further proof of what a godawful writer/director George Lucas is...)  The rest of the cast are character actor types, and they're all fine.  Interestingly enough, Stephen Rea's Finch, the man who is heading the investigation of V and discovers dangerous governmental secrets in the process, is the major point of identification for the audience. (Or, he was for me.)  I liked him, so it worked, I guess.  Also, I think it's neat that this movie is filled with ugly people, all creased and lumpy and old and with bad teeth.  (Though the one major female character is still very attractive, prior to her hair being cut off, anyway.)  That just happens so rarely.<br /><br />The film perhaps dragged slightly in the final acts, but only briefly.  It's also hurt by a slightly underwhelming and perhaps overly happy conclusion, but how do you finish a story like this anyway?  The ending in the comic wasn't utterly satisfactory either, so while it's different it's a fairly lateral move.<br /><br />The controversy surrouding this film is fairly stupid.  Yes, it's Anti-Bush.  I've encountered anti-Bush sentiments before, however, so I'm not particularly shocked or impressed.  Yeah, the protagonist is a 'terrorist', but that just proves how vague and variable language is.  He blows up a couple of empty buildings and kills some people who wronged him personally all while attacking a government that is legitmately evil and managing to avoid injuring the innocent almost entirely.  In short, he's no more subersive thean a million other film heroes, and less so then plenty.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  An entertaining, sometimes enthralling film.  It's not as smart or deep as it thinks it is, or as some will tell you, but it's smarter than most major films, I suppose, and is always watchable, which is what really matters.<br /><br />Grade: Ba godawful writer/director George Lucas is...)

0739313126|5.0|I drive 40 minutes to and from work each day, and The DaVinci Code book on tape made me look forward to my commute. The narration is clear, concise and exciting.  I couldn't want to get to the next chapter! The only problem is not wanting to leave your car to go into work!! I created the \\"visuals\\" in my mind as the narrator read the book...it is almost like seeing the movie! The narrator used different accents for each character, so it is easy to differentiate the characters which makes things clearer since you don't see the text in front of you.  I highly recommend this book on tape to anyone who doesn't have the time to sit and read a long book.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|\\"The Return of the Voice\\" it was heralded. More like the \\"Attack of the Screaming Mimi\\". In the beginning, Carey's performance art consisted in the technically proficient rather than the emotional tonality. The post-Tommy years saw her dwindle that siren-like screech by leaning toward more hip-hop cred - sort of 'The Pornification of Mimi'. While those results were more laughable, at least the thought was more laudable, and thank the powers that be, more listenable, albeit never - ever - lovable. Well, to secure both audiences, `Mimi' juxtaposes both dichotomies to the nth degree. Her gift was never for inventive melody, it was for memorizing the Who's Who of producers and arrangers, but you know you're hard up when even the Neptune's come up empty handed and Jermaine Dupree feels lost. But mediocrity was always a comfortable bed for Carey to lie in - this commercial comeback garnered Mariah her biggest opening ever, and her 16th [or 17th] #1 single. But, count out artistry here - it's a genius marketing of a record company getting what they paid for.  My grade:  D+<br /><br />*************<br /><br />I wrote that review when the Cd was first released.  This public menace has since then lost the major Grammy's she was unjustifiably nominated for and re-released 'Mimi' as a platinum edition.  Ignore the hype, folks.  The new songs are just as hideous, the videos ust as poorly acted as 'Glitter' [which is always the case with this banshee], and the remix is ear-blood inducing.  I guess for the masochists who enjoy this sort of thing, this release would garner an A or so, but for this non-believer [since 1990 and growing strong!], i downgraded from the original D+ to an E.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Fagen delivers again with \\"Morph the Cat\\". When it comes to richness of sound and attention to detail, Fagen and Steely Dan have no equal. Morph is his strongest album since \\"The Nightfly\\" and is much more personal than the last 3 albums. He is in a major infectious groove with \\"H Gang\\" and \\"What I do\\", and \\"The night belongs to Mona\\", and \\"Mary shut the garden door\\" are also standout tracks. If you are looking for another 70's Steely Dan album, you may be dissapointed. But if you love the funny, oblique, sardonic lyrics that Fagen is known for wwrapped around some excellent jazz/funk/soul grooves, you will love \\"Morph\\". The session musicians are all stellar and the guitars and his voice are up front in the mix more so than on his last 3 efforts. Worth a buy.

At the dawn of new wave, the bleach blonde belter with the best sneer since King Elvis churned out a pumping fistful of punk-friendly radio classics bolstered by STEVE STEVENS' hard rockin' guitar salvos. Between the club floor thump of DANCING WITH MYSELF and tough Tommy James retread MONY MONY, the darkly divine WHITE WEDDING, and the rebel yell of, well, REBEL YELL, Idol had early eighties radio playlists and MTV in his hip pocket. Later singles scarcely packed the same kick in the head, although EYES WITHOUT A FACE wasn't half bad for a change of pace ballad. Soulless covers of the Doors' paean L.A. WOMAN and Simple Minds' DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME are dull regurgitations here...those two missteps aside, if Billy's your Idol, then this is your anthology.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR STIFF UPPER LIPS

B00005JOE8|5.0|\\"V For Vendetta\\" did something I didn't think a contemporary Anti Establishment movie could do: it instilled compassion for a murderer and made me agree with acts of terrorism. In today's day and age, it's easy to see why that would be hard to accomplish, considering how inhumane most terrorism is. This movie has a way of blurring the line between a nonviolent conscience and a radical need for change, and the fact that it was able to do that fascinated me on so many levels. There are a couple of people to thank for this: first and foremost there are Alan Moore and David Lloyd for creating the original graphic novel; then there are the Wachowski Brothers for adapting the graphic novel into a screenplay; and then there's James McTeigue for his direction. <br /> <br />Of course, the cast has to be thanked as well, most notably Hugo Weaving for his incredibly effective portrayal of the shadowy bandit known only as V. What we're shown is a classic antihero character, completely and appropriately surrounded by an air of mystery (which is obviously helped by the fact that he's never seen without wearing a Guy Fawkes mask). It's very much safe to assume that he's not quite normal, both mentally and physically; he seems invincible from the way he fights, but more so, he seems incredibly cultured, not only from his expanded vocabulary, but from his interest in theater and film, as well (he's quite fond of the movie \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\"). The only concrete insight we're given concerns one major event from his past, an event that completely shapes him into a vengeful yet important instigator of society. I dare not say what that event was, nor do I dare say whom he wishes to hunt down and destroy. But rest assured it's one of the most pivotal plot devices in this movie. <br /> <br />A lot of ideas presented have been used before: this is a futuristic story (although it's the not-too-distant future) about a totalitarian government and the rebel who decides to take a standagainst it. Even though that aspect is fairly unoriginal (all you have to do is read George Orwell's \\"1984\\" or see Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\" to see what I mean), the way \\"V For Vendetta\\" is told completely makes up for it, especially since it sends a message that a lot of people need to hear. That's probably why it wasn't surprising that the filmmakers included a cop (Stephen Rea as Chief Inspector Finch) who starts out loyal but gradually rethinks everything he's been told to believe. Hints of the Holocaust were added to the mix, as well, and that to me was even less surprising.   <br /> <br />The not-too-distant future we're presented shows us England under the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). It's a heavily regimented society formed from the devastation of disease and the collapse of major governments (our country is referred to as the Former United States). Maybe that's why Sutler is practically never seen in person; he's a ruler whose face is almost exclusively seen on a greatly oversized television screen (which I'm sure was an intentional tribute to Orwell's Big Brother character). To say he has absolute control over the country would be an understatement; political opposition, homosexuality, and religious freedom are all illegal and punishable by death. (Does any of this seem overwhelmingly familiar?)  <br /> <br />The vast majority of the population is complacent and fearful. We frequently sees shots of regular families in their living rooms watching their TVs, witnessing the government's propaganda in the form of falsified news bulletins and religious banter (delivered with style by Roger Allam as the despicable Lewis Prothero). You can see the anger and sadness in their eyes as they're being lied to from their own people. At the same time, you can see the unwillingness to do something about it; anyone who's ever faced a dilemma knows the agony of not rocking the boat when they know they should. <br /> <br />Things get interesting when we meetEvey (Natalie Portman, who can finally fake a decent British accent). Her past is about as dark and painful as you might expect, and as a result, she has some intense but reserved feelings about the government. She's introduced to V in a back alley after some corrupt police officers attempt to rape her. Right away it becomes obvious that the two were meant to be allies. It's also obvious that she is intrigued yet suspicious of his beliefs and methods. What are not so obvious are his feelings for her, and they remain elusive throughout the film; he's accommodating and witty while at the same time overpowering and distant. These conflicting personalities were eventually foremost in my mind, especially after Evey is kidnapped, questioned, and tortured (but to find out why, you'll have to see the movie).   <br />   <br />Some may be offended by \\"V For Vendetta\\"'s unapologetic views on oppression and freedom, and they certainly have the right to feel that way. Nevertheless, I truly feel that this is one of the most relevant films of the year, especially given the issues and controversies we continuously see in the world. It's by no means just a stylized action thriller, as the television commercials may lead some to believe. Underneath it all, it's trying to convey a serious political message, one that doesn't have to be believed so much as it does have to be heard.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|<br />  i really really want my 3 hours back!  <br />  The new king kong movie is so bad that for most of the second half i was screaming on the inside and fighting against myself to stop from screaming&running away from the room.Really,i cant tell one good thing about this one. <br /> <br />  The visual effects are great.Ok we got it!You dont need to show every single,simple,silly movement of the stupid monkey for 15 minutes.it takes nearly an hour for us to see it already. for that hour we watch that stupid director character, (something black..?)unnecessarry \\"we were so poor\\" thing, side characters that are obviously destined to die and take nothing but time,some wild folk living inside the LORD OF THE RNGS decoration sets...All of these are the creation of a director who is blinded by too much money,too much fame,too much ideas and lack of real creativity.(taking about jackson,not the one inside the movie :)) <br /> <br />Then comes the kong.He holds the girl.Holds her and screams for like 15 minutes.it is like watching a 1 minute clip over'n over again.Then he starts running.For another 15 minutes you watch it run and wonder how the girl has not one single broken bone, cos she should be turned into powder.Then you probably fall asleep,and get awaken by screams.See the kong fighting against some dinasours...for about half an hour.i mean it is actually funny if you can stand watching it.gorilla making kickbox. <br /> <br />in between somewhere,dinasours follow people.For about another hour.dinasours are pointless,the chase is pointless,the scene is pointless,just like the movie itself. <br /> <br />Then they bring the kong,which is bigger in some scenes and smaller in others;into the city.then he kills people there, throwing blondies around.And expect us to get sorry that he is dead. <br /> <br />i mean;in the ending;the planes make about 10 rounds around the tower the kong stands.and we watch like every second of it, all the turns they take.And believe me,those planes are slow. <br /> <br />i was screaming like; kill that stupid monkey so we can go home. <br />then it dies...oh my god the happiest moment of the movie.and some people (none in the theatre i watched it,luckly.i can beat someone for that)cries that he is dead.it is pure emotional exploitation. <br /> <br />This movie is supposed to be a family movie.so why is the scene with all those creepy monsters in the middle,eating our team in worst ways?i mean;kids are watching that.ok we got it you can make good creatures look like real. <br /> <br />To be honest;this movie is a real waste of time and money.it is just the work of a spoiled director who thinks that he is the king cos he made a legend like LOTR come true.But believe me, neither him nor the kong isnt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Never has a movie so moved me as Brokeback Mountain.  It is not a gay cowboy movie but a universal love story about two people in love and the price that is paid for that love.  It is about conforming to society instead of being true to oneself and the consequences to that for all the people involved in lives such as those portrayed. Ledger and Gyllenhaal pulled it off in spades. You actually feel for the characters they have created and feel the love they have for each other. This movie should have won best picture at the academy awards but lost due to unfair prejudice by members of the academy that refused to see this brilliant movie.  It has moved people by the thousands and improved lives....Discover it for yourself, you'll never be the same again.

It speaks to your inner self, tuning in to your most sensitive and passionate self. <br /> <br />I chose three of my favorite cards in this tarot deck: <br /> <br />1.  The No-thingness card - totally black card.  The 176 page book describes it as - because the nothing is not just nothing-it is all!  It is vibrant with all possiblities, etc..... <br /> <br />2,  Slowing down - a large tortoise wading through the mud and weeds - we are like the tortoise, we carry our home with us, wherever we go.  There is no need to hurry, to let go of expectations you've had about yourself or other people.  <br />The last paragraph of the commentary is the keyword - The essence is at ease.  Do whatsoever you are doing, but at the deepest core remain at ease, cool, calm and centered. <br /> <br />Slowing down is so beautifully said-I cannot say it more graciously! <br /> <br />3.  Existence - One of the major arcana card that comes after the Fool.  A picture of the back of a naked - long hair woman sitting on a lotus leaf of perfection. I love the way the book describes this No.1 Major Arcana card - you are not accidental. Existence needs you.  Quoting the last sentence \\" Once you are clean and clear, you can see tremendous love falling on you in all dimensions.\\"  <br /> <br />This is very calming, it speaks directly into your heart and soul and gives \\"one\\" peace and serenity within.  You will learn to slow down and become one with Zen!      <br /> <br />

B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman Begins takes the franchise out of the realm of cartoons and puts it back where it began and belongs, in the world of dark comics.  Only twice does the movie slip into action movie cliches -- during a long chase scene and in the convoluted climax where the \\"wow\\" factor is almost equally balanced by the \\"what the heck is going on?\\" factor.  Fine acting throughout, particularly by Michael Caine, Christian Bale, and Gary Oldham.  Batman Begins has much to say on the theme of good versus evil and justice versus vengeance.  And it make its points without a moment of preachiness to mar the story.  The two hour running time flies by.
B000BBOUCW|3.0|Okay, the first thing that I want to point out is that this is a very beautiful anime. The animation is mind-blowing and should get the respect it deserves. <br /> <br />But, beyond that, the plot totally sucks. The creative team behind this basically digs at the bottom of the plot barrel to cook up a scenario where one of those Jenova-infused clone people touches a piece of Jenova then *POOF!* becomes Sephiroth and remembers everything he did so he and Cloud can fight for half an hour. I suppose this makes sense to someone who's just gotten done watching Dragon Ball all the way through, but it kind of detracts from the quality of the anime.

B00005JOE8|5.0|I just saw this movie today and it was f***ing awesome. This is a vision of the near future where democracy dies and dictators rule with an iron fist. This is nothing new. we've seen it before around the world both in ages past and in our own time. The movie even speaks about the fall of America and how our wars have led us to ruin. Opposing the government and state-run media is a man dressed all in black and wears a white mask who carries out attacks on government buildings on November 5 and kills those in power who he deems corrupt. This movie is NOT for children as it is graphic at times and also the storyline of a dictatorship might scare the small kids and make them think that terrorism is an acceptable way to get our governments to listen. This is not politics...this is treason. So therefore I urge parents NOT to let your kids who are under the age of 17 see this movie. I feel that it should be pulled and re-rated NC-17 because it glorifies treason and terrorism even though the government in the film is a dictatorship. If you are willing to overlook the terrorism aspect then this is a really good movie.
B000CSUYKG|5.0|Blondie gave new credibility to pop music in the late 1970's. Soon outgrowing their punk roots, they created first the brilliant Plastic Letters in 1977, then this masterpiece the next year. At least four chart hits were lifted from this album, but there could've been more.<br /><br />Picture This and Sunday Girl are evocative numbers with an undertone of sadness, somewhat in a 60's vein, while Heart Of Glass is of course the hypnotic mega selling pop disco hit, later covered by The Associates among others.<br /><br />My other favourites include the experimental and moving Fade Away And Radiate (Was this perhaps influenced by Bowie?) and I'm Gonna Love You Too, a happily rolling power pop tune.<br /><br />Tracks like Pretty Baby, 11:59 and Just Go Away are catchy and memorable too and could also have been hits. I'm not particularly fond of Hanging On The Telephone and the rest, but they also have plenty of melody and excitement. Blondie's pop displays wit and intelligence in the music, making wry comments on love and life.<br /><br />Some music journalist once claimed: \\"Rocks gets stale, but pop rots.\\" Blondie proves him wrong, very wrong. This music has a timeless appeal, and today still its intelligence enhances the lasting pleasure it gives me.
B00005JNQS|5.0|My two boys (aged 5 and 7) have watched Robots over and over again.  They debate who is going to be which robot, they laugh loudly in exactly the same places and enjoy the DVD as though it was the first time played.  Which I think is extremely good value for money.  It has a good story, the robots show that caring, being kind to each other, working as a team etc is better than being greedy and only looking out for yourself.  It is full of fun and the robots are brought to life with real characters.  I believe that we will continue to play this DVD until it is worn out!

039472903X|5.0|There are a few books that are masterpieces not only because of what they say, but how they write it. This is one of those books.  <br /> <br />Even if you aren't involved in advertising or marketing, this is a great book to read just to see how a master expresses clear ideas. Its main ideas are as fresh and applicable to the world of the web as they were many years ago to the world of print. People read things that clearly state advantages and are easy to read graphically and literally.

Contrary to most music out there. it doesn't sounds like it was put together by a bunch of teenybopper 8th graders using a computer to make the music, as a school project.
B00005JLKB|2.0|Smallville tells the story of superman starting in early high school and how he became the man of steele. The reason why I give it two stars is because the show itself is very stupid , at first the show starts off great giving you addictive characters then the storyline is good too, and so is the acting everybody does great on the show, BUT then the show starts to repeat it's storyline by saying everybodies problems are from meteor rocks and when I mean everybody I mean EVERBODY seen to get infected from the stupid rocks,lex luther seems to cry about his evil father in every freakin episode, then Lana Lang seems to say sorry to clark in almost every freakin episode ,you start to tell yourself this is getting kinda stupid, the show it self never changes no matter how many seasons you buy you'll get the same storyline ,clarke trying to hide his stupid secret and lana saying sorry for this and that. <br />            Another stupid reason why you should not buy this is because you'll never get nothing new meaning a different storyline as well as a good season finale or premere since they never make sense. Please don't waste your money on this crap or I promise your regret it

B00065MDRW|5.0|That quote, from by Peter Townsend of The Who, may be the best description of this album.  This album set the stage for too many 1970's acts to name. Possibly the most influential progressive rock album of all time.

What a great book!<br /><br />I honestly couldn't put it down and had to force myself to go to sleep just so I could pick it up again the next morning!<br /><br />If you enjoy symbology, iconology, suspense, and conspiracy theories then you'll really enjoy this book. I loved the way it played off of Da Vinci's works and made me think and question.<br /><br />Definately worth the read!

B0007GAERG|5.0|This the true Emancipation of Mimi, the albulm is by far Mariah's greatest, and in my opinion she's only going to get better. With not only the music but also the success of this album, Mariah has proven all the naysayers wrong.  <br /> <br />One of the great things about this album is that it has a little bit of everything, from the hoppin' party hit \\"It's Like That\\", to the Gospel Ballad of \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", none of the songs seem like fillers.  <br /> <br />Mariah has done mightey well for herself and The Emancipation of Mimi, is an album that will go down in history known as the Official Comeback!!
B000E6UK5K|2.0|This album will put Sominex and night-time Nyquil out of business.  It's elevator music-meets dental office. A big disappointment.  I'm a fan of Floyd (both with and without R.Waters), have been looking forward to this album for some time, and it seems the anticipation was greater than the event.  I'm just glad I didn't pay top dollar to see Gilmour in concert if this is what he's going to play.  My recommendation is Gilmour fans buy his awesome DVD album from a few years back. It's a live show featuring old floyd songs, some random new stuff, and some tunes I never heard of, but all of which are very enjoyable.  On An Island...well, it should have been left there.
B00005JOFO|2.0|Now that I have your attention, I went to this movie expecting nothing considering the media hype surrounding its pre-release. That is pretty much what I got. First,  I will admit that the movie is not a bad movie, just amateurish in alot of respects. For example, we have 2 aimless drifters (one who wears a white hat, and the other a black hat..hmmm...) who manage somehow to \\"fall in lust\\" one long \\"hot\\" summer. At the end of the day, however, we have no idea whether its lust or love, was it just 2 bored and horny men taking care of business or a deep love that transcends societal constraints (something the gay establishment would like us to believe). Well, after 4 years of no contact (during which white hat gets married and has 2 kids based on an obligation to marry a woman--what a concept!, black hat gets married for money to a girl he meets after a failed attempt to pick up a guy at a bar) they reunite....and the rest is history. <br />I found this movie overly long and tedious to the point of disbelief. The two characters are in their own way ridiculous. Black hat is clearly an opportunist both sexually and financially who has no qualms about leaving hearth and home to take up with white hat who to his credit (at least for the first half of the movie) maintains his dignity by at least pretending to stand by his commitment to his wife and children. However, by the last half of this movie, white hat seems a bit off since by now its the late '70s, the Village People are in full drag, and being gay is tres chic..he still stays way way in the closet while black hat is prowling anywhere he can to get off (that includes Mexico, a buddy in town, and God only knows who and what else). Of course, black hat meets his end at the hands of ignorant folk (or so we should believe) that has nothing whatsoever to do with his choices in life....and white hat goes to lead a miserable existence without black hat (he was apparently going to have to do anyway since it appeared that black hat had found someone else and was about to ditch white hat, what a love story!!!)....considering white hat's moribund personality, this was a foregone conclusion. <br />Overall, I would recommend renting this movie for no other reason than seeing how Hollywood and the gay establishment got it wrong. There is nothing uplifting about seeing 2 men in love, or lust, or whatever you call it, lieing to themselves and the people around them to no end other than to make life miserable for everyone involved.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Never has there been a movie that has stuck with me for this long. After i saw the movie, all i could think about was how unbelievably depressing this movie was. These men, are just two guys who happen to fall in love with each other. And this doesnt seem to be the kind of love we have today. This is soulmate, eternal love...the kind that seems it will go on for ever. And then this tragedy happens. (And Heath Ledger's acting in this part was incredible). You really start to think about how much he wanted to live his life with Jack, but he couldnt because he was afraid that it end in one of their deaths, but it still does. And i thought that maybe if they had had their life together, this might not have happened, and that's the tragic thing. This movie has really made an impact on the people who have seen it. Some people are too narrow minded to see beyond the \\"boringness\\" of the movie. Not all movies have to be action packed to be good.
B000BISBDY|5.0|When you ache so bad you think you will die, when the world turns its back, when you have lost everything, Johnny Cash's raw,tortured voice calls to you.  When you are sitting pretty, high on the hog, he reminds you that it can all change in a heartbeat- so enjoy it while you can.  <br /> <br />Cash fans know he is incapable of bullsh*t.  When the world buzzes in your ears so loud you forget who you are, Johnny pulls you back down to earth and tells you that your personal traumas and joys matter and the struggle between your inner demons and angels matters. It is impossible to listen to this album and not feel like Johnny has looked deep into your soul and sung every one just for you. <br /> <br />Buy it.  Listen to it.  Then try to love life like Johnny did.

B000089Q9G|5.0|Fine piece of work by Polish director who emigrated to France, and Juliette Binoche, who starred with Jeremy Irons in \\"Damage\\".  She was also the wife of Daniel Day-Lewis in 1988's \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\", one of my all-time favorite films.  Here, she is so beautiful, with that steely fragility that Catherine Deneuve also radiates.  This was a mood piece, with marvelous cinematography, about a woman picking up the pieces of her life when her world - famous composer husband and 5-year-old daughter -are killed in a car accident.  There is really very little dialogue.  Many close-ups of Binoche's face.  First in a trilogy of the colors in the French flag - blue stands for liberty.  She is now free of all family ties, but what has she got?  Nothing.  There is the quote from St. Paul flashing across the screen, \\"And if I do not have love, I am nothing.\\"  There are a great many blank places of film, with only music in the soundtrack, as if the director were suggesting that Julie was cutting out of life or resisting or merely blanking out for a second.  I have now seen all of Kieslowski's body of work, and it is powerful.  He has an insight into human nature, and is willing to delve into that nature, to an extent that no other director can match.

0440237688|4.0|Jonas, the eleven-year-old protagonist, lives in a community some time in the future, where everybody is equal and controlled by the leaders of the community. No one in this place has feelings or memories of the past, but after Jonas becomes the new Receiver of Memories, everything changes for him. He receives feelings and memories that makes him realize the sad state his community is in. Therefore he makes a plan to escape... <br /> The Giver is a story about a fictional society in the future. The reader can realize how important feelings and emotions are for our lives, especially if compared to the unemotional lives of the members of the community. At the beginning the book is not very exciting until Jonas becomes twelve and is assigned his job. From this moment the pace of the plot increases and the story gets more interesting. <br />Besides you will understand how important it is to make your own choices and to be allowed to have real feelings. Sometimes the book is even a bit shocking, because a few events are very extreme.  <br /> <br />In our opinion there are two important messages: <br />1 You should better make your own decisions and you shouldn't believe and trust everything that you are told.  <br />2 Problems are necessary in our life. If you never had any difficulties like hunger and suffering, you can't enjoy the very good things and feelings <br /> <br />Read this book! But we can only recommend the book to people who are prepared to think about it intensively and to deal with the topic or to those who are interested in futuristic stories. Children should be able to talk to someone about it who can help them to process the information. The book gives you a great understanding of many important things that make up social life.  <br /> <br />
1932100385|5.0|This is a fascinating, objective review of dozens (or hundreds)of studies on nutrician and the effects on health.  This should be required reading for everyone since the information in this book could dramatically affect their lives.   <br /> <br />It may shock most people into understanding that what they eat can (or, generally, will) affect their health and longevity.  This compilation of hundreds of studies reveals how your diet affects your liklihood of developing many types of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and many other diseases.  The huge chinese study is only a part of the information, though it totally supports dozens (or hundreds) of prior studies.  The book, written by a life-long research scientist, is fascinating and also explains why we often never hear of these studies.
B00005JOE8|4.0|Overall, I was definitely disappointed by \\"V for Vendetta,\\" primarily because I was anticipating a really great adaptation of the work by writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd.  I was also looking forward to a movie that I would be able to use in my Introduction to Popular Culture class when it comes out on DVD because I thought it would be a nice example of how cinema functions rhetorically.  The idea that a masked figure who blows up public buildings could be a revolutionary hero rather than a murdering terrorist is a radical notion post 9/11.  But this film lacks the subtlety of the original graphic novel and makes a strategic error in foisting a conclusion to this dark tale.  The results are compelling, but not the provocative story I was hoping to see.<br /><br />After recapping the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot for ignorant colonials, we cut to the future a couple of decades down the road where Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), is out after curfew in London.  She is about to be raped and probably killed by \\"fingermen\\" of the security forces when she is rescued by V, dressed in black and a Guy Fawkes mask.  He takes her to the roof top where he conducts a symphony that end with the Old Bailey blowing up.  They meet again when V takes over the single television channel to broadcast a promise that one year hence he will blow up the Parliament building (on Guy Fawkes day, of course) and asks that everyone in England who supports his cause to take to the streets that night to support his actions.  When Evey acts to protect V from the police, he takes her under his wing, and begins to educate her on his method and his madness. Meanwhile, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) is put on the case but immediately hamstrung by the government from being able to investigate the clues that would lead to the identity of the terrorist.<br /><br />The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers turns Moore's attack on the conservative inclinations of the government of Margaret Thatcher into a more overt representation of a fascist government.  The insignia of this brave new world is a twisted version of the cross, and the fact that the person in charge is a chancellor recalls Hitler, as does the way the chancellor dresses.  Casting John Hurt, who played Winston Smith in the 1984 of \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\\" as Adam Sutler, the fearless leader in this film only heightens the Orwellian analogy.  Moore and Lloyd had the evil men of the government look like ordinary bureaucrats, but this film stacks the deck so that the allusions to Hitler and \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" are so obvious that of course our sympathies are with the terrorist blowing up the buildings (besides, they are not our buildings, they are English buildings; but more on that later).<br /><br />In the movie V speaks of the power of ideas and the importance of using words to persuade rather than coerce, but what really matters is blowing up buildings.  However, in the graphic novel the point was to blow up symbols.  The shift from having Big Ben be the first thing that V blows up in the book, to the total destruction of Parliament being V's ultimate goal, is rather significant.  V's final target in the book was 10 Downing Street and the final explosion is seen from the distance because the explosion is not the point.  It is the awakening political consciousness of Evey that is the soul of this film.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the film provides, in relative terms, a happy ending.  No political diatribe worth its salt is going to warn the masses of the evil inherent in the system and then provide an ending that reassures the audience that everything is going to be all right.  The graphic novel ends with a victory, but clearly the war will continue, for at least another generation.  The movie seeks to reassure us with a Rolling Stones song (and does not even bother to play the entire song).  Moore and Lloyd wanted to enlist us, following in the footsteps of Evey as she follows V, but the makers of this film would be happy if we pre-order the DVD after seeing the film.<br /><br />For most viewers it will be the way the films resonates against current events that will be the primary point of controversy.  Relatively few will have read the graphic novel, but far more people remember September 11th in the U.S. than the 5th of November in the U.K.  The idea of purging an English-speaking nation of Muslims, immigrants and homosexuals may or may not seem like something that can happen here.  Blowing up apparently empty buildings in the middle of the night and reserving the blood letting for situations where V gets up close and personal with the bad guys can certainly make this terrorist seem different and, dare we say, acceptable.  In the end we are so clearly distanced from this story that it does not ask us to make any hard choices.<br /><br />I would have preferred to see \\"V for Vendetta\\" as a television mini-series, not only because I think an episodic approach is better suited to telling the story, but also because it is a much more intimate tale that what we see on the big screen where they go out of their way to crank up the volume on the explosions.  Beyond that, the frozen face that is V's mask becomes a disadvantage both for Weaving and director James McTeigue.  There is only so much you can do with lighting and head tilts, and the first-time director relies too often on close-ups (no wonder James Purefoy bailed on the role).  \\"Sin City\\" set a standard for adapting a graphic novel to the screen that will probably never be approached by any one else, but I was hoping this one would be a lot closer to the mark.she follows V, but the makers of this film would be happy if we pre-order the DVD after seeing the film.    <br /> <br />For most viewers it will be the way the films resonates against current events that will be the primary point of controversy.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Donald Fagen has done it again. If you just sit back and listen, perhaps once or twice, you will be able to fully understand the true appreciation of Donalds most recent work, \\"Morph the Cat.\\". This is a continuium of this man's outstanding ability to combine his poetic expressions with an outstanding melodic composition. I think you must understand Donalds musical talents before passing judgement on this work. I have been a very fond admirer and devout fan of this man since the beginning and this fits in perfectly with his growth and development as far as his professional musical talent.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Ostensibly \\"Capote\\" is the story of Truman Capote writing \\"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,\\" about the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. The book is considered a landmark in American letters for epitomizing, if not creating (as Capote claimed), the new genre of the non-fiction novel, wherein the traditional conventions of literature were applied to a crime story. However, by the time we fade to black and get to the title cards that let us know the rest of story, it becomes clear that \\"Capote\\" is trying to provide insights as to why the author of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" never finished another novel. Publishing the novel changed American literature, but writing it changed Capote.<br /><br />When the Clutters are married, Capote reads of the story in \\"The New York Times\\" and decides he wants to write about it for \\"The New Yorker.\\" The editor, William Shawn (Bob Balaban), agrees and Capote heads for Kansas. He connects with the head of the investigation, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), through his wife, Marie Dewey (Amy Ryan), who is dazzled by a celebrity from New York City. Capote does not care if the killers are caught or not, but Alvin Dewey does. Once Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are captured, convicted, and sentenced to death, Capote's biggest concern is keeping the two murderers alive long enough to hear what happened that night. He helps get them new lawyers for a series of appeals, trying to get Smith, the one of the pair with whom he has established a real rapport, to provide the details. In time that will happen, but then a horrified Capote realizes he cannot complete the book because Smith and Hickock are still alive and the story will not be over until they are executed.<br /><br />Capote is accompanied to Kansas by his friend, Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who in 1959 has recently finished her book about children and a dead bird, and is trying to find a publisher. I am drawn to the irony that Capote and Lee worte what are arguably the two most important books produced in my life time, yet neither wrote another (and there are those who claim Capote co-authored her book). I know enough about \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" which was developed from a series of short stories based on incidents in her family history, to accept the idea that Lee had but one novel in her and that when that book is selected novel of the century there is nothing to complain about. But it is impossible to believe the same of Capote, and the film that bears his name gives us some indication of what is lost when the author gives a public reading from his book and it becomes clear to us that \\"In Cold Blood\\" is as good as Capote claims.<br /><br />In a year when three of the Oscar nominations for Best Actor are based on not only real people but famous people whose way of talking (and singing) are well known, Hoffman's performance stands out for the moments when we are not listening to Capote's affected speech. It does not take long in the film to distinguish between the Capote of the cocktail parties, when he clearly knows he is on stage and the one that can be persuasive when out and about in the real world. But for me the key moments are when Capote is silent, observing and reacting to people and things. Part of the reason Hoffman won the Best Actor Oscar as expected was because of the respected body of work he has produced in films over the last decade, but the majority will be because of this finely nuanced performance that is so far removed from the caricature it could have been that we accept him as Capote and are suitable impressed.to find a publisher.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I just love this great album. Each and every song is great. Whoever says it is punk, you're an idiot because Green Day plays hard rock. Now you know what I mean, huh. Before I review every song, I'd like to say that this CD is fun for birthday parties...and to all the Led Zeppelin fans, shut up because <br />Green Day is the great. And this item is highly recommended. <br />1. AMERICAN IDIOT: Great song, very funny. <br />2. JESUS OF SUBURBIA: One of my favorite songs on the album. Very long, and it has 5 different songs in 1 song. <br />3. HOLIDAY: Great anti-war song. Funny. 1 of my favorites. <br />4. BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS: Great song but overplayed. <br />5. ARE WE THE WAITING: Good slow song. <br />6. ST. JIMMY: Great fast rock song. The Death of is even better. <br />7. GIVE ME NOVACAINE: Billie Joe Goes to the DENTIST. Great. <br />8. SHE'S A REBEL: Good but maybe my least favorite on the album. <br />9. EXTRAORDINARY GIRL: Who said that Green Day meets the Beatles? <br />You are a 1 minded idiot because the Beatles suck and always did. <br />Anyway, good. <br />10. LETTERBOMB: What an intro. <br />11. WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS: A little slow then gets heavier as the song goes on. <br />12. HOMECOMING: The great song. Again, very long. My favorite part is 'We're coming home again'. Rocks hard. Maybe my favorite on American Idiot. <br />13. WHATSERNAME: Great way to end it. 1 of my favorites. <br /> <br />This album is a must have. Go purchase 2 copies today. <br />And today is that day that you play Green Day, Saint Patrick's Day.  <br />My name is Macy Rockaway.
B00005JOE8|4.0|First the plot--Imagine \\"Batman Begins\\" with the Liam Neeson character as the hero crossed with \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" with a twist of 1984 thrown in for good measure and you've got an idea of the film \\"V for Vendetta\\". V (Hugo Weaving)is bound and determined for justice and that includes taking down the government of a man (John Hurt)who has turned England into a God fearing police state. V is on a time table to undo this government as the government is looking for him. In a TV broadcast he tells England he will take out the House of Paraliment by November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day in England)and asks the population to show their support by being there when he does it. The film though turns on the relationship between V and Evey (Natalie Portman)the daughter of two revolutionaries put to death by the government when she was a child. She represents us as she observes V and slowly comes to understand his madness. When she is saved by V from rape by members of the government she is thrown into a world she can no longer make heads nor tails of. Clearly this film isn't going to be for everyone and fans of Alan Moore's graphic novel will probably be disappointed. No matter the film manages to tell a gripping story for a mainstream Hollywood release. This isn't \\"The Matrix\\" nor is it \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\". It's better than the Matrix sequels but not quite as great as I'd hoped. It's still an entertaining film. It's clear by the vote count here that somehow I've been unhelpful. I'm not quite sure what folks were looking for here but this film did appeal to me even if it wasn't perfect.<br /><br />V may be a bit naive (when he takes out the government he believes that the people will take back power and the government will fear them instead of the people fearing the government)he's also a fascinating mixture of vigilante, hero and villan. Stylishly directed by James McTeigue (assistant director of \\"The Matrix\\" here helming his first film)with beautiful cinematography by the late Adrian Bittle (\\"The World is Not Enough\\", \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Thelma & Louise\\")\\"V for Vendetta\\" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it. Written as a protest against Thatcher and her government policies, \\"V for Vendetta\\" works amazingly well in this adaptation by \\"The Matrix\\" writers Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. Featuring stunning performances and great support work particularly by Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigoett-Smith and Rupert Graves \\"V for Vendetta\\" takes a lot of risks for a mainstream Hollywood movie in the post 9/11 world we live in but it's points are intelligent and well worth noting.hy by the late Adrian Bittle (\\"The World is Not Enough\\", \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Thelma & Louise\\")\\"V for Vendetta\\" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it.

B000AP04NI|1.0|This is my first time in this forum <br /> <br />I've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLE <br /> <br />AS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist.  <br /> <br />I choose the first option.  <br /> <br />Are you so kind  -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ? <br /> <br />Yours <br /> <br />RR
B000059TEP|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites.  Both the music and the story are great.  Whoopie Goldberg is her usual funny self and at the same time this movie will bring tears to your eyes.  Great love story!
0684859106|1.0|In 127 pages of this book, there are only 8 photos!<br /><br />If photos are important to you - and they are to me - don't buy this book.<br /><br />(I am returning it to Amazon - I wish I had looked at it at a bookstore first!)
0345441184|5.0|I have read this book five times now and I still seem to get something new out of it every time.  A well researched book and the most realistic account of the times of King Arthur that I have read.  Highly recommended.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Leave it to Disney to create a modern update of \\"Chicken Little\\". \\"Chicken Little\\" the film is more loosely based than an actual re-telling of the well known children story. Disney adds a twist of the sky is falling story and blends it with a little science fiction ala \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"Independence Day\\".<br /><br />The main character of the story is Chicken Little. He lives with his widowed father (voiced by Gary Marshall). His friends consists of other outcasts Runt (Steve Zahn), Abby (Joan Cusack) and Fish (Dan Molina).<br /><br />Zach Braff is the voice of Chicken Little who gets knocked on the head by a hexagonal object from outer space.Chicken Little's response is that the sky is falling. Of course no one believes him and they think he is a bit off his rocker. A year later, Chicken Little is still trying to shed that image. Once again Chicken Little gets knocked on the head by another hexagonal object from outer space.<br /><br />Children will probably like \\"Chicken Little\\" more than adults. I found the film a bit too cutesy for my taste. The alien invasion really was a bit much but I guess ya can't go far with the original storyline so Disney had to bring in aliens to make the movie last over an hour. I actually like the father-son subplot of the film. I thought that was more interesting than the alien invasion. The 3D animation was good. As an adult and doesn't have any children, I have to say this film is not geared for folks like me. For adults with children they probably will like it or at least their kids will.
B00000892G|5.0|A true Epic Metal masterpiece, and my all time favourite Album. The concept is so spiritual and ancient. A state of Defiance against all the False Gods that try to control our fate. And powerful inspiring music to go along. If someone needs to define what Epiko Metal is, then.. this is it! David DeFeis is a Master of the Force and there is solid musical proof of that! Invictus..
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I've been a Sarah McLachlan fan since 1988 - before most people knew of her.  Although her vocals have always been rich and passionate, Afterglow takes this to a new level.  Every song is sing-along clear (no making up the lyrics - and just in case you can't make one out, they're included in the CD cover pages).  I could listen to this CD every day.  It is both touching and inspiring, and ultimately human - admitting she is not quite the person she aspires to be and thanking her husband (and the world) for accepting her as she is.
0156030209|4.0|Regarding the claim that this is \\"a story that will make you believe in God\\"......the author claims elsewhere that the proof of God is not IN the story -- the proof of God is that there ARE stories. Religion, like love, is non-rational, but it helps us understand the universe. A good novel, like religion, makes you suspend disbelief.  <br /> <br />If you find the going gets tough, keep on keeping on. The payoff is worth it. <br /> <br />There are lost of intersting tidbits buried in plain sight or below the surface worth keeping an eye out for.  For example:  <br /> <br />- Pi spent 227 days on the lifeboat - 22 divided by 7 = 3.141..(Pi) <br />- The Patel family left India on the summer solstice (June 21, the date of a pagan festival) and Pi arrived on the Mexican coast on February 14 (date of a Christian holiday -- St. Valentines/Feast of Love).
B00004RJ74|1.0|George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys. <br /> <br />This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package <br />wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be. <br /> <br />However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then. <br /> <br /> <br />In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did. <br /> <br />By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way <br />better than the main feature. <br />
B00003CWL6|4.0|It was the little film that could: well-known stars, a small budget and a debut director that ended up being pretty successful, even garnering the big Oscar prize. Instead of being a long epic dramatic film, American Beauty, a small suburban based film with big problems ended up winning. And just like Shakespeare in Love or A Beautiful Mind, people will absolutely love it or some who just can't stand it. I have no idea where I fit in. <br /> <br />Lester Burnham is an unhappy married father working for a magazine. Despite working for more than 10 years, he needs to prove he still can do a good job. At home, he's got a very pedantic suburban housewife and the pre-requisite lonely confused teenage daughter. Well, a girl changes his life and soon he starts being more uninhibited including quitting his job, buying a car and telling off people who annoy him. In the meantime, his wife is also changing her life and his daughter is pursuing a relationship with an odd kid next door. <br /> <br />I'll be honest: I saw this once before and I have to admit, I hated the thing. It seemed like artsiness to the extreme and while it's not as strongly it's still there. Roses flying out of shirts, laying in a pool of them, getting some philosophical meaning out of a flying plastic bag it seems like self-knowing importance. While there's nothing wrong with it in a film, to put a whole bunch of clever and grandiose images to me cheapens it a bit. <br /> <br />Where the film succeeds though is its performances, except personally two. Kevin Spacey is always reliable and Thora Birch is perfect as that confused grumpy teenager. The only 2 that don't fit are Annette Bening and Wes Bentley. The former seems to overdial her performance at times being very loud and little else while Wes just seems to stare a lot. Allison Janney seems kind of wasted, not terrible. She's just very underwritten and just...\\"there\\". <br /> <br />The film's tagline \\"look closer\\" is perfect for the film as that big helicopter opening shot makes it look picturesque Americana-like but further in there's a lot of problems. Boring go-nowhere jobs, too-happy spouses, whiny daughters and oddball neighbours are very much in style right now and the film shows them off at their worst. <br /> <br />It's highly debatable whether American Beauty deserved its Best Picture. It was up against favorites Sixth Sense and Green Mile, 2 admittedly good films but little in the way of classic Best Picture status. So it was either the better film that year or a lack of options. I liked Sixth Sense more but this film's still as enjoyable.
0345475674|3.0|Harris manages to write a decent novel with an intriguing \\"hook\\". It was the Empire's easy access to water, thanks to its brilliantly engineered system of aqueducts, which kept it together. When the capital to keep the water flowing ran out three centuries after the time in which this story takes place, the empire fell apart. <br /> <br />In the story at hand, it was the disruption of the flow of water to the \\"Roman Riviera\\" in the south that first alerted those with eyes to see that something was amiss, though they couldn't quite figure out just what was happening. <br /> <br />The premise is intriguing, and Harris' attention to historical detail is admirable. He doesn't quite have the knack to combine this historical knowledge with writing a good story or in creating good, three-dimensional characters, however. Steven Saylor, in his series of Roman novels and short stories featuring \\"Gordianus the Finder\\", is masterful at doing this, combining historical accuracy with writing a good yarn, with flesh-and-blood characters, as Harris is definately not. Harris' characters tend toward wood, his dialogue is stiff, over-dramatic and doesn't sound like speech, and he seems to have run out of creative steam by the book's melodramatic, cop-out ending. <br /> <br />But on its own terms, this book is enjoyable.
0780622650|4.0|I like this movie.  It is far better than what some of the reviewers would have you believe -- especially in comparison to the godawful TV series.  If it had been shortened by about 15 minutes, including taking out some memorably bad dialog, it would have been much better.  <br /> <br />Others have already comented on the special effects.  I actually bought this just to experience them on a good system, having only seen it on pay channels, and I wasn't disappointed.  The production quality is excellent, and if it wasn't for the Jupiter II having so much wasted space onboard, I would find it very believable.  The quality of the DVD is top notch, although there are occasionally startlingly grainy scenes (thankfully short ones) and the sound is terrific -- especially through good headphones.   <br /> <br />The robot is really cool.  Matt LeBlanc is almost cool as Major West.  And am I a pervert for lustng after Lacey Chabert in boots, an adult playing a young teenage?  LOL  <br /> <br />I gave it 4 stars because it's a 3 star movie for less than $10.  It certainly was better, IMO, than Star Wars episode I, in every category.
B00005JOE8|5.0|This is easily the best film that I have seen in the early stages of 2006. The acting is great, with the faceless Hugo Weaving playing V with great physical presence and an intelligent voice. Natalie Portman turns in one of her best performances here which shocked me to say the least.  She even looks hot bald! The visuals, music, set design, and action scenes are perfect without being overdone. This is a thinking action film, heavy with smart dialogue and interesting ideas. Some people are looking for a buried political message about our government in this movie, but it is based on a graphic novel written long ago. The government in the film has more in common with the Nazi party and Hitler than anything going on today. I will be seeing V for Vendetta at least once more in theaters and will add the DVD to my collection the day it is released.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is Bons Sgt Peppers. Brian's is Back In Black. This album is so good, it's scary. A must have and a good place to start for a new ACDC fan, or else get Back In Black or the live album. This album will always remind me of October and getting ready for Friday Night football games, and the parties afterward. if you want to party, get this classic, one of the best Rock albums ever.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Two years ago at this time, Mariah Carey was a joke. Sure, she was huge in the 90's, but then... she was nothing. Mariah Carey has made a huge comeback with her new CD \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\". <br /> <br />Featuring the extremely popular hit's \\"It's Like That\\", and \\"We Belong Together\\" (which everyone was humming during the summer), this CD is awesome! Of course, there are some songs better than others. Some songs, I have to admit, are kind of boring (\\"Joy Ride\\"), but most of them are great ballads and feature MC's awesome voice (\\"We Belong Together, \\"Mine Again\\"), and some are just plain fun (\\"One and Only (f/Twista)\\", \\"Get Your Number (f/Nelly\\"), and finally, one very inspirtation track (\\"Fly Like A Bird\\"). <br /> <br />Overall, this album is great, and probably the #1 Album of the Year. Thank God Mariah Carey is back!
B000069HKH|5.0|This is Bruce at his best. This album really helped heal me after 9-11 more than anything else, though 20 years from now they'll just be great songs to a new generation. We saw him in Columbus, Ohio on The Rising tour, 7 rows back, and it was moving and the most transformitive experience I've ever had at a concert, and I've seen Floyd, Fleetwood Mac,McCartney,Meatloaf, The Eagles, and many more. This album rocks and celebrates life, it's not a bunch of downer slow acoustic songs. I love this album and this album proudly got my wife into Bruce, now she's a complete Boss junky. If you like Bruce, buys this, listen to it at least 3 times, and you will love it.

B0007OCG56|1.0|Spanglish is a big boring mess, with terrible performances by Adam Sandler (completely miscast) and Tea Leoni. If this had just been a movie about a Mom from Mexico trying to deal with raising her daughter in the US, it would have been great.  The performances by Mother and daughter, Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, were excellent.<br /><br />The most unbelievable part of the film was that the audience is supposed to believe that Adam Sandler's character, a chef and restaurant owner in LOS ANGELES, speaks not a word of Spanish!  Not a chance in real life.  Who do you think is working in the kitchens in these fancy restaurants?  Spanish speaking employees.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Relaively fun albeit exaggerated look at the effects of global warming. The special effects were as fabulous as most modern day movies are with Dennis Quaid somehow tramping from DC to NY during a sudden ice age to rescue his son.  Always a solid performer, Jake Gyllenhall makes me want to be nerdy 17 year old again. Fun disaster movie all around.
B00005JOE8|4.0|If Ultraviolet is an action flick where you park your brain, V for Vendetta is the movie that makes you engage your brain.<br /><br />Having never read the graphic novel, I am not aware of the differences, but I can say I will read it soon.<br /><br />Howeer this was a policital parable, with layer upon layer of allusion and meaning.<br /><br />However, it is hard to catch on to exactly what parelells to draw.  It is clear the paralells to the Nazis, yet, you can feel that somewhere the director and writers were trying to draw to today and the conditions in the USA.<br /><br />The plot is twisted and layered, but simply put, a virus has struck the world, leaving it chaos.  A dictator has pulled England together, and a la' Big Brother, his will is law.  There are informers on the streets, surveilence vans and censors on TV.  Unfortunately, that isn't too distant from the world both the British and we Americans live in.  And that was my major concern. It is clear the creators wanted to comment on our current state, included the color coded states of curfew - much like homeland security's level of alert.  But they don't go all the way, they continually draw back on the punch<br /><br />Hugo Weaving plays the masked V, terrorist/freedom fighter.  The only one willing or able to take on the totalitarian state.  He does so wearing a Guy Fawlkes mask, and uses the Fifth of November to remind people of two very simple principles:1. those who forfeit freedom for security deserve neither and 2. people should not fear their government, government should fear their people.<br /><br />Natalie Portman (rediscovering her ability act post Star Wars) is Evey - a woman swept up into V's life.<br /><br />This movie is rich in historical and literary allusion the way the matrix was rich in philosophical allusion.

In this movie he does alot of drugs and he sings though. Then Johnny Cash goes on stage and starts to sings though in the movie.

0679422714|3.0|It is a very controversial book. I found tons of discussions on the web and wikipedia, but decided to read and decide for myself.  <br />No doubt it is not objective, trying to prove in every phrase and page that Mao \\"was bad\\".  <br />I expected to read a story, some history and decide for myself. What I found in the book was a bit annoying. I'd like to discover and decide, not to be led to one obvious conclusion (Yes, Mao was \\"BAD\\").  <br />R
B00008O89K|5.0|To speak of the music I first need to speak of the movie: Too many people have ridiculed me for my love of the Conan the barbarian movie! It stems from a deep seeded North American prejudice that these types of films are for 'geeks' or some sort of violent catharsis. Well, yes and no, regardless, it is this misconception, or at least prejudice, that has held back the power and beauty of this music. <br /> <br />Now, of course, this sort of stuff is all the rage, what with Braveheart, Gladiator and Lord of the Rings, for example. So who is listening to this soundtrack now? Well, mostly us violent catharsis type geeks who wouldn't trade a moment of our future to ease into the comfort of our past. <br /> <br />This soundtrack is haunting, striking and powerful. It speaks of, and it speaks to a fading culture. All those strings and brass, all those voices and percussion...they aren't what this music is about: it is about the emotion, not the medium. <br />
B000069CWE|5.0|Hybrid Theory was a great record when it came out, but have you listened to it lately? Probably not...and if you have, you probably noticed how it doesn't really bring that energy it did a few years back.    On the other hand, Reanimation is an absolute mastery of studio production and rearrangment. This is not a remix album but rather a complete reworking of the original to create a more hiphop driven sound that is still very much Linkin Park. There are even slight modification on some well known lyrics along side the addition of some new ones by some top guest MCs.    This record is in the same vein as 'Further Down the Spiral' in that it takes the source material as the main sampling source, but creates a completely new sound that (in this case) surpasses that of the original. Linkin Park have managed to ride that fine line between rap and rock and mix the two in a way that is absolutely brilliant and like no other in popular music...and for that, this record is definitely a must have.
B00005YU1O|4.0|It is a great movie! I even ordered a copy for my boyfriend, and my best friend, and they loved it too.  It is a great way to get a new perspective on your sleeping life and your waking life.  It is like a great animated version of Slacker.  Well it was directed by the same guy, so it has the same feel to it.  It doesn't have the exact same content as Slacker, but it does have similar insightful.  I love it!

B000BW7QWW|2.0|I was so disappointed in this movie. Perhaps it is because I never watched the series or perhaps it is because I also have good taste. After reading all the great reviews I was sure I would like this movie, but now I am wondering if I watched the same movie that everyone else did......The movie was full of cliches, the scenes were disjointed and hard to follow sometimes, I had a hard time hearing some of the actors deliver their lines because it sounded like they were mumbling or talking too fast to end the scene, and despite all the action scenes I was bored. Worst of all I felt no attachment to the characters whatsoever. A good movie is one where you WANT the characters to survive, not one where you just hope they all die so the movie will be over. That brings me to River....she was very irritating. She was slack jawed and emotionless to the point where you wanted to check her for a pulse. The captain was a cold and unlikable character (especially when he threatened to shoot his crew). I actually felt myself rooting for the bad guy in this one because he was the only good actor. Frankly, I think this film is a insult to the viewer's intelligence. It seems as though the writer thought he could get away with his weak characters and storyline if he threw in enough action scenes. Or maybe he just didn't try to write a good movie because he was counting on die hard fans of the series to watch this no matter how bad it was. It seems as though there is such a lack of good science fiction movies lately that people will like anything with a flying ship in it. <br />So please people, stop giving this movie four and five stars. Its simple, if we stop watching crap like this hollywood will be forced to make a GOOD sci-fi movie.
B000006045|5.0|I've listened to a lot of electronica-dance and I think this one is one of the best. It's dark and a bit aggressive, much similar to Prodigy but in a more electronic sense. Especially the song \\"angel\\" reflects this dark hypnotic type of music that is on this cd. <br />Love it!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This film adaption of the longest running musical in Broadway history does the show justice, and provides the viewer with many memorable numbers that will no doubt stay with them for quite some time. <br /> <br />All of the performances are first rate. Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel and despite some jabs from the critics I believe Butler did a phenomenal job as the phantom. His deep, rough and yes, imperfect voice was a perfect pitch to play the deeply troubled Phantom. Depsite the somewhat hollow role Patrick Wilson turns in a good performance Raoul, and one can tell of his Broadway experience by his polished vocals and fluid demeanor on screen. <br /> <br />As for the visuals, this is the area which I believe the film adaption outdoes the musical. The costumes, sets, lighting and special effects are completley breathtaking-- you'll want to view this DVD on the biggest screen possible to fully enjoy the eye popping colors and textures. <br /> <br />So until you can get to New York to see the stage version yourself, snatch up this DVD quickly and enjoy one of the most classic shows of all time!
B000B8QG4A|3.0|Even though it's considered a Disney classic, and contains some lovely character animation, \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is one of the studio's least satisfying efforts.  The simple boy-meets-girl plot takes over half an hour to get rolling, not a good sign in a seventy-five minute movie.  Its stultifyingly rigid depiction of gender roles makes one long for Betty Friedan, and the infantilized Lady actually represents a step backward from earlier Disney heroines like Snow White and Cinderella.  Worst of all, this film wallows in racial and ethnic stereotypes, many of them deeply offensive to contemporary sensibilities.    Although \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" was shot in Cinemascope and Academy ratios, this DVD edition presents only the widescreen version, albeit in letterbox and pan-and-scan formats.  Image and sound are excellent.  Extras are plentiful, though not up to the wealth of archival material in other Platinum Edition DVDs.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|i was outside the gates of hyde park on july 2 listening with thousands of others on the streets. this product gave me the visuals i lacked and definitely amplified my memory of live 8. if you were there or if you wanted to be there, buy this!
B000E6UK5K|4.0|It's been at least ten years since David Gilmour has done a formal recording. I am not one to criticize an artist who takes their time between recordings. Lets face it; David has nothing to prove here. This album is the answer to the question \\"were do we go from here\\" Gilmour style. I am actually glad that Gilmour presented this as a solo album. I grow tired of the whole Roger Waters drama. Pink Floyd reunited for live 8, what else can you ask for or expect from them.     The music on this album is reflective, often simple, dreamy, mature and very laid back. Glamour's voice sounds as good as ever. His guitar work here glows and shimmers especially on the solos for \\"The Blue\\", \\"On an Island\\", and the tender \\"Were we start\\". Gilmour deserves more credit than just being considered a great improviser. His guitar works does more than just improvise, he also creates wonderful melodies that are as long as they are creative. He never sounds lost, or even makes the slightest mistake in his solos whether it be a note that wasn't bent quite enough, a slide that didn't land correctly, or an idea void of expression or feeling. I would have given it five stars but I do agree with some other reviews that this could be too laid back at times, and is missing that one rocked out tune with a more up beat tempo and harder driving material.    As for all of the other critics, Pink Floyd will most likely never tour or record again. So judging this album purely on that is just a mistake. Don't buy this album just because you like Pink Floyd. Buy it because you like David Gilmour, who was the musical side of Pink Floyd. Gilmour has done what great musicians do, move on, and do it his way. The sleeper has awakened after so many years, or is he still dreaming? Either way the effect is sublime.
B000301YY8|1.0|Perhaps I'm biased. I've been forced to endure 'You're Beautiful' every single lunch time because my classmates are obsessed with James Blunt. Personally, I can't see the attraction.    Firstly, there's his voice - how can anyone can listen to him moan for any longer than five seconds? He doesn't have a good voice, nor does he have an interesting voice. Seeing people rave about the \\"raw emotion\\" in his voice is bizarre. I've never heard such bland, emotionless music in all my life.    Secondly, there's the songs - look past the dreadful voice, and there's dreadful songs. Completely tuneless. Arguing with a friend who likes James Blunt, I told her that I thought James Blunt was for people who didn't like music. She replied, \\"Yeah, well - I don't really like music\\". The reason half my class at school are obessed with James Blunt is because he's in the charts, and the only way they'll ever listen to a band or singer is if some half-witted DJ plays it on the radio again and again and again until anyone with EARS would begin to have violent-urges. I'm sure I'm not the only person who feels like resorting to violence when they hear a James Blunt song on the radio.    It's disturbing to hear that he's so popular in America. At the moment there are some fantastic British bands, but you wouldn't have thought it if the only British singer that gets in the charts in America is James Blunt. The only good thing that could possibly come out of his popularity in America is that if he's torturing Americans with his noise pollution, at least he won't be bothering the British.    So my advice is, if you don't like music, listen to James Blunt. If you do like music, or you value your ears and/or mental health, avoid at all costs. If you want \\"raw emotion\\" or a singer with actual talent, listen to Antony and the Johnsons.
0312330537|5.0|Oh man! what a story, and so beautifully written. After reading it the first time my ticket was booked for Mumbai (Bombay). What followed was yet another life changing experience of india in all its wonderful maddedned splendor and the purchase of a second book from the very streets of Colaba causeway for yet another read of its nine hundred and something pages. this Novel is so much more than just a ficticious story. Based on the real events of this guys life back in the 80s, The story and India became a personal journey for me. damn, i cant wait for the sequel, i just might pick up one of my 2 copies and read it again. A tuff act to follow for any attempt at a movie, forget what anyone might say otherwise. This book rocks!!! do not miss out, and go to India!!
B00004YW6I|3.0|I certainly understand the negative criticism from the more dedicated Polly Jean fans.  To some, going pop is a bit like going to the dark side.  Sonically speaking, I've never discriminated against music for simply being pop (much), and this album is no exception.  The lyrics, however, are what make it a 3-star album rather than a 5. <br /> <br />Another reviewer pointed out that writing about pain and sorrow is easier than writing about being happy, and that her lyrics seem phony because of this.  This is true, for the most part, and the integrity of what could have been a great album was sacrificed.  I don't necessarily agree about the lyrics being phony, per se, but I do agree completely that they could have been better written. <br /> <br />To be fair, however, she was obviously working under the extreme influence of American culture.  Sometimes there's absolutely no escape until you just get it out of your system, and I feel that's what she was doing; consciously or not.  Exorcizing herself of the consumer demon.  I, for one, apologize to PJ on behalf of all Americans for being the superficial, gluttonous, and oblivious nation we are, for turning what could have been a great collection of songs into bite-sized sap.  Sonically, it's not nearly as pop sounding as many would have you believe; she's not breaking any new ground, but she's not sounding like anyone else either, and that counts for a lot.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: Nicely accessible music, but TOO accesible lyrics.  Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea comes off almost as a parody, which would be brilliant if it were, but it's not, sadly.   <br /> <br />Or is it?   <br /> <br />(I like to pretend it is, then I can enjoy it completely guilt free)
1400079276|5.0|I am not quite to the end of this amazing novel -- so surreal and yet so emotionally real -- and I can't wait to see what happens. I also wondered about the translation -- how much is Americanized for our benefit, and if it's not then is it even more dream-like in Japan? From Colonel Sanders to eggs for breakfast, and all the musical references -- Prince? A thoroughly modern book with historical context, Kafka on the Shore captured my attention completely. Don't worry about \\"getting it\\" and just go along for the ride. What a story!
B00008YJH5|5.0|I would just like to add to the shameless bootlicking of this glorious collection of some of the best songs ever written.  While any time is a good time to listen to the Pixies, nothing beats the first time.  Particularly any song off SURFER ROSA or DOOLITTLE, but any Pixies will do.  Listening to them for the first time will blow your face off.  And I am working under the assumption that if you are reading these reviews in order to decide whether or not to buy this album, then you clearly have never heard the Pixies before; if you had, you'd know there is no question, and you'd have to hear more on general principle.   To listen to the Pixies and crave more is compulsary. <br /> <br />Now, I have never been one to fall for the hype.  Truth be told, when the Pixies first came out, I put off a couple years in checking out their music for that very reason; I didn't want to fall victim to another hyped up case of false advertising and empty promises.  I was skeptical at first, and those were years of my life that I effectively wasted not listening to the Pixies, when I could have and most definitely should have been. <br /> <br />DO NOT let that happen to you, you can never get your non-Pixies years back.  Buy it now.
B00005JO20|4.0|I Will keep this review short and sweet. First off I never got the chance to see this movie in theaters, but I have stumbled upon a advanced DVD screening copy (not ripped but the real deal) at a flea market (yes its real duh and has those annoying marquee messages that pop up saying this is for award critics only), basically the movie is good and Jack Black add his own comedic sense of style in this movie as a con man attitude whos down and out and needs to make this last movie on skull island or hes pretty much dead in the water in the film industry if he doesnt pull it off. When they get there they find out more then they bargained for and Jack Blacks character relentlessly tries to see his movie through and through even if it comes to death. But there are times... quite a bit of times where the movie gets drawn out as in it juss takes a lil bit too long to get to the point and the drawled out scenes doesn't really keep it interesting. I'm not in no way comparing this movie to Lord Of The Rings, it does have the same kinda feel to the lord of the rings as in that it takes a lot of time telling the story and i mean a lot. Basically its a good film but it didn't really do too much for me. Great visuals and special effects, good acting, and the scenes with the natives are especially great and well thought out. If it wasn't so \\"drawled\\" out so to speak I'd give it 5 but i have never seen the original movie so i can't contest to say if it was the same way. so maybe other people will greatly appreciate it. So no one takes me wrong by the way Im a lord of the rings fan and do like the long story telling but it was in no way boring or drawled like some of the scenes in king kong (which are few but long).<br /><br />+ Good story<br /><br />+ Jack Black plays his character well and adds some comedic value  to the movie which keeps you drawed in<br /><br />+Great visual effects and Kudos to the scenes with the native savages and the sacrafice scene<br /><br />- Only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is there are some scenes that are boring (to me so i dont get flamed by other reviewers) and will kinda withdrawl the audience.<br /><br />All and all by the movie its worth ithat keeps me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is there are some scenes that are boring (to me so i dont get flamed by other reviewers) and will kinda withdrawl the audience.<br /><br />All and all by the movie its worth it
B000002J0P|4.0|Crosby, Stills & Nash was a classic debut by a classic band. Though its followup (Deja vu) overshadows it, it's still a great release!<br /><br />Okay, so you've undoubtabley heard a personal favorite of virtually every CSN fan, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes. A very ambitiuos piece, but it works quite well! SAdly, Marrakesh Express isn't quite up to Judy Blue Eyes' standards. But Guinnivere, another favorite of mine, definetly is. This acoustic, Medival-influenced track will haunt you forever. As will the psychadelic war protest Wooden Ships. Long Time Gone is another winner, with its fine vocals and lyrics.<br /><br />If you like CSN, seek this out!

0765340798|1.0|If you have ever had that feeling after watching a movie, where you tell yourself,i cannot believe i watched the entire movie.That is how i felt after i completed reading this novel. I kept hoping the plot would improve, and it never did. I get the impression the authors struggled for material for this third edition. The focus of the story seemed disconnected at times from the true plot of Dune.
B000068FWC|5.0|This album is just classic. Supertramp was never really my cup of tea until I heard this album. So, this album is just amazing. I would say it's their best, but I haven't heard of their other albums. Song Highlights: Gone Hollywood, The Logical Song, Goodbye Stranger, Breakfast In America, Oh Darling, Take The Long Way Home, Just Another Nervous Wreck, Casual Conversation, and Child Of Vision!
B000089RVX|5.0|For the past 3 years now, Evanescence has been my favorite band. Around 2000 I heard the song 'My Immortal'. It sounded nice, but I didn't pay much attention to it, mostly because of the band's long name that I couldn't pronounce. In mid 2003 I had MTV on the background and they aired 'Bring Me To Life'. I was in a different part of the room, so I didn't quite listen to the song, but Amy's voice kept haunting me (imagine my surprise to later find that they actually have a song titled 'Haunted'...). I remember even asking my sister about 'a song that the girl sings and the guy screams'. They were tough to find, mainly because the song's title is different from its catch phrase ('Wake me up inside'). I managed to find out who they are, and to this day it is one of my happiest discoveries. It was also around the time when I had to lose a LOT of weight, and their music gave me the energy and the strengh to do that, while Amy's voice kept me motivated, so this review is also my own personal success story, which is a great debt I owe to them. <br />Here is my break down of the album: <br /> <br />1) Going Under - this is a great song. The lyrics are very harsh and dark. I read somewhere that it's originally about coming out of a bad relationship. I related to the song differently, because I was teased and bullied a lot when I was a little kid. Often ppl say that the first step is realizing what the problem is, and I think that the song deals with exactly that. I think that the message is: 'You hurt me, and held me back. Now I'm going to try and be successful, but if I fail, then I'll know it's because of you'. 5/5 <br /> <br />2) Bring Me To Life - even though it's overplayed, I still enjoy listening to it. It's a very innocent request, and it's almost a love song about a very deep connection between two ppl. It is very beautifully written. I won't quote it here, because I would just end up posting all the lyrics here. 5/5 <br /> <br />3) Everybody's Fool - this is one oftheir songs that I didn't like that much in the beginning, but I grew to like it (at this point, I think I love all of their songs). I guess I just didn't understand it. Turns out that this song was actually written back in 1999, based on an occasion that Amy caught her younger sister dressing up like one of the Britney clones that were all over the 'music' market at the time, so Amy had to give her 'the talk'. I still think that it's too dramatic, but it does send a powerful message to the fans: 'idols' have to maintain a certain image and do not necessarily act that way in real life, and also don't try to copy the ppl you idolize - be original. I also really like the video for this song way they performed this song on the dvd. 4/5 <br /> <br />4) My Immortal - where do I even begin with this one? I think I'll start by stating that this magical piece was done back in 1996, when Ben Moody was only 15. It's about 2 very close ppl that one of them dies, and the spirit of the dead one still haunts the person who is still alive, to the point that the living person asks the spirit to leace them alone. Evanescence recorded more demos of it (even the version that is on 'Fallen' is a demo. It's the 2000 version with strings added to it) and performed it in defferent styles, until they came up with the final version, titled 'Band version'. This song demonstrates part of why I love this band so much: they make many different versions of their songs over the years, and you can actually hear them evolve. It is also a piano ballad, which really lets Amy's power vocals shine. 5/5 <br /> <br />5) Haunted - like 'My Immortal', this song is based on a story that Ben Moody wrote. I don't like this song as much, but I guess that if you really want to get into it, you should watch their new live performance of it. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />6) Tourniquet - this is an adapted cover. It was originally titled 'My Tourniquet' and recorded by Soul Embraced, Rocky Gray's (the drummer) former band.Evanescence added a second verse to it, and wrote the melody (since the original only had the guitar riffs screaming of the lyrics). This song deals with a Christian conflict: on one hand, there is no forgiveness for taking a human life, but you are forgiven for everything once you are about to die, so what happens if you commit suicide? <br />this song also marks the dramatic climax of the album, as in the middle of the song Amy screams 'I want to die!' (a scream that, may I add, in live shows she never does. She uses a pre-recorded track for it). 5/5 <br />Getting back to my personal story from above; this song made me realize that I didn't want to die like that. <br /> <br />After 'Tourniquet' there is an orchestral interlude which connects it to the next song. <br /> <br />7) Imaginary - this song is the final version of the song that can also be found on the first Evanescence EP from 1998. Amy once said in an interview that she has very vivid dreams ('I linger in the doorway of alarm clocks, screaming monsters calling my name... In my field of paper flowers...' and so on), and this song captures some of it, but what happens when the dream you created for yourself to escape from your reality, becomes a nightmare, and you still prefer it to the reality? 4.5/5 (only because there is another version of this song that I like better) <br /> <br />8) Taking Over Me - I think that this song is about the fear of being forgotten, but more than that, the feeling that you are taken over by the memory of someone else, that you don't even recognize yourself anymore. 5/5 <br /> <br />9) Hello - similar to the album version of 'My Immortal', this is also a piano-based ballad, which also deals with death. I read that when Amy was very young, her sister died, and in this song she captured her grief, which is why she never performs it live. Musically spaeking, this song is very special on this album, because after the instrumental part, Amy goes up an octave, and reaches some amazing high notes. She has a beautiful and wide range that isn't showcased enough on this album (in my  opinion). 5/5 <br /> <br />10) My Last Breath - a beautiful 'goodbye song'. the lyrics are really deep, and you can hear that they poured their heart and soul into this song. 5/5 <br /> <br />11) Whisper - this is the final version of the song that can be found on their Whisper/Sound Asleep EP from 1999. It's an peic piece, on which you can actually feel the apocalypse coming. It ends with a Latin choir begging us to save them and ourselves from evil. 5/5 <br /> <br />I really love the way this band combines the hard-rock, piano the choir and the strings in their heartfelt songs, and to top it off, their singer is the most talented vocalist I have ever heard. She has both the ability to sing (the range) and a beautiful voice. <br /> <br />If you like this album, and want to know more about the band and the origin of their sound, then I  recommend that you also check out their demos, which are available all over the internet (in many interviews, the band said that it's ok to download their music to see if you like it, but if it's something that can be bought and you like it - you should support the artists, or there will be ni music to download). One demo collection is even called 'Origin'. My favorite song is from that cd, and it is called 'Even In Death'. <br /> <br />Evanescence also put on a great show. If you're wondering what they are like live, then you should also check out their dvd 'Anywhere But Home'.
B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie's ZIGGY STARDUST album is his best. Why, you ask? Well for one reason, it's one of the best albums of all time. Second, it has spawned a cult phenomenon. Third, Ziggy Stardust is one of rock and roll's best creations. Lastly, the album is timeless. Millions of people across the globe can relate to the album. They can also relate with each other because this album has changed their life.<br />  Ziggy Stardust was recorded at Trident Studios during late 1971 to early 1972. It was produced by Ken Scott. The album cover is known to millions. I personally think this is the best album cover of all time. Although, his Aladdin Sane album cover is a runner up! The photos for the album were shot by Brian Ward. Most of the album's inspiration was from the 1971 film, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Bowie has said the gatefold was a sort of homage if you will to the film.<br />  Ziggy Stardust was originally released on RCA records on June 6th, 1972. I call this the day music came alive! It went to No. 5 in the UK charts and No. 75 in America. Yet still, it is very popular in America. Huh? Confusing. But anyway, this album is pure genius and every music lover should own it.<br /><br />  The Songs:<br /><br />  1. Five Years (5/5) Ah, the opener. Not one of Bowie's popular tracks, but a key track. It explains the world problems before Ziggy Stardust steps in.<br />  2. Soul Love (5/5) A nice little track. Love the saxophone. It's basically about different kinds of love.<br />  3. Moonage Daydream (5/5) I LOVE THIS DAMN SONG! Best track on the album. The birth of Ziggy!<br />  4. Starman (5/5) A nice little poppish song. Ziggy gets contact with young teens and learns the earth going to end. He wants to save the earth, but he thinks his impact will be severe.<br />  5. It Ain't Easy (3.5/5) Ugh, i hate this song. Oviously the worst track on the album. But it fits with the whole concept. It's about how it ain't easy being famous.<br />  6. Lady Stardust (5/5) Beautiful song. I think it's about Marc Bolan. The details for the song fit who it's about. =)<br />  7. Star (5/5) Another good song. Hell they are all good. The song explains what being a star is about.<br />  8. Hang On To Yourself (5/5) A nice, quick song. It's basically about Ziggy trying to hang on to himself because of his fame.<br />  9. Ziggy Stardust (5/5) THE WHOLE ALBUM IS SUMMED UP IN THIS TRACK. The 1st really known song from this album to the US public.<br />  10. Suffergate City (5/5) Another hit from the album. Its about how woman are looked at by men and men think they are just objects for lust.<br />  11. Rock N Roll Suicide (5/5) The death of Ziggy Stardust.6. Lady Stardust (5/5) Beautiful song. I think it's about Marc Bolan. The details for the song fit who it's about. =)            7. Star (5/5) Another good song. Hell they are all good. The song explains what being a star is about.            8. Hang On To Yourself (5/5) A nice, quick song. It's basically about Ziggy trying to hang on to himself because of his fame.            9.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Having been a \\"Firefly\\" fan, I eagerly awaited the release of this movie. I was in no way disappointed. It flows perfectly, follows continuity, and keeps a great balance between action, humor, and drama. If there is any flaw, it's that some people who did not read the \\"Serenity\\" 3-issue Dark Horse comics did not know certain things. The comic book trilogy bridges some of the events from the t.v. show to the movie, such as what happened to the blue-hand men, Shepherd Book, and such. I believe it is released in a trade paperback now, so you should read it. It helps flesh out this beauty of a film. Then watch the movie (again).

B00008H2LB|1.0|Does this craptacular band think they're metal? With lyrics like, \\"Don't stay. Forget our memories. Forget our possibillities,\\" and, \\"I'm tired of being what you want me to be,\\" are emo not metal. With an inaudible bass, annoying as hell lead vocalist, and a terrible guitarist this band are more Limp Bizkit wannabe than new metal gods. Here's more suggested listening:<br /><br />Metallica(old)<br /><br />Slayer<br /><br />Iron Maiden<br /><br />Pantera<br /><br />Anthrax<br /><br />King Diamond<br /><br />Megadeth<br /><br />GWAR<br /><br />Opeth<br /><br />Type O Negative<br /><br />Sepultura<br /><br />Children of Bodom<br /><br />My Dying Bride<br /><br />Venom<br /><br />Ozzy Osbourne/Black Sabbath<br /><br />Deicide<br /><br />In conclusion, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park are two garbage bands that are destroying metal this generation. Let's stop this once and for all!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just like the other reviewers here, I cannot believe this show was canceled! I'm not so much a science fiction fan but I was a huge fan of this show due to feeling of connection this crew had with each other--the comraderie they seemed genuinely to display pulled me right in and made to feel a part of it, too. Sure, there were some hokie moments but for the most part the acting was superb, the wit/humor was dead on and the timing was perfect. Excellent writing overall!!! There were many messages gained from this show but the biggest was: stick tight to those you love and face life, love and danger with passion and most of all, a sense of humor. By far, the most Soul displayed from a Sci-Fi show I've ever witnessed and up there with any other conventional show as well. I own this series and look forward to watching it many, many times!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've watched 10 episodes of the 14 presented here, and each one has been great writing, great stories, great characters, great action, great everything.  I wouldn't expect much less from Joss.  What's funny is when I heard through the grapevine about this, it didn't sound interesting at all compared to Buffy and Angel.  Then Serenity came out and got great reviews and even better moviegoer reviews.  Since it was based on the series, I thought I'd better see the series first. <br /> <br />After watching the first disk via Netflix, I cancelled the other 3 disks from Netflix and bought the series.  You won't be sorry.
B0000062FJ|5.0|More than 35 years after its initial release, Santana's first album still remains fresh and relevant.<br />Latin rhythms, rock and blues all merge together to form Santana's unique sound.<br />This \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" has been digitally remastered and sounds great.<br />The icing on the cake is the three bonus tracks from Santana's electrifying Woodstock performance, a performance that shot the band into national prominence and deservedly so.<br />The original Santana band lineup was to go on to make 2 more excellent albums (Abraxas and III) before parting ways but neither of them, nor the albums that followed with other musicians, capture the raw energy of the group the way this first album did.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love the show and am glad to be able to watch it whenever.  I recieved the product promptly and in the condition I expected.
0884271536|4.0|The novel was easy to read with short chapters. From a content point of view, it gave some new insights in how to go about with project planning and critical resources.

B00005R2IS|5.0|I received this movie very fast and in great condition! Thank you!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I decided to have a watch of Napoleon Dynamite after being told by many how \\"great\\", \\"fantastic\\" and \\"wonderful\\" it was.    In great anticipation, I inserted the DVD into my drive and watched with my equally excited friend. We watched Napoleon's antics. Some were mildly amusing, but never \\"ha ha\\" funny. We watched his boring friend Pedro run for class president. We watched his weird brother become a homie. We watched the nerdy lady friend become happy. We watched a lot of stereotypes. None of which were humorous at all. We were both very dissatisfied with the film. I like lame humour, but this type was just pathetic. It's a ridiculously monotonous film with an uninteresting plot.    Unfortunately, for Christmas my uncle decided to buy me something that all the girls at his work were talking about. He bought me Napoleon Dynamite on DVD. \\"Thanks, I really love this movie,\\" I lied.    Me and my friend decided we'd give it another chance. Sometimes I like movies better a second time. Not Napoleon Dynamite. The only thing we giggled at was when Napoleon sulks, \\"Idiot!\\".    This movie is lame and hardly a masterpiece. It is full of boring characters and pathetic stereotypes. In a way, it is just another teen movie. Needless to say, I sold my DVD a few days later. Very disappointing for such a hyped up film. Maybe I just don't get it. But I doubt it.
B00009P1MP|5.0|I knew the song, American Pie for a lone time, but I didn't catch many words. To me, the song was one of the good songs <br />musically. This was because English was not  <br />my native tongue and I didn't look at the lyric sheet.  <br />But today I was fortunate to read the sheet (I bought it today!), and realized Don is indeed a splendid writer. His words are beautifully written - poetic / beautifully rhymed / full of imagery / full of conscience. Now I feel the song might beat Tangled Up in Blue (which I rated the best one in the 20th century before I checked the lyric sheet)(Bob Dylan)when it comes to imagery, clarity, and conscience. What is more important, this song is important historically. <br />Thanks, Don! Thanks for giving me a chance to appreciate the best song in the 20th century. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|this is simply the best and most heart-wrenching love story i have ever seen. it is the most touching movie u could ever watch and the most memorable one. its about 2 men ennis del mar (heath ledger) and jack twist (jake gyllenhaal) who just happened to fall in love while working together one summer. but because of the time it is set in and the society they have to keep their love life a secret. despite the lack of action in this movie u will feel hooked and not bored at all. this movie is the best movie of all time and it should've won in all the categories it was nominated in at the academy awards. the actors are amazing and they make the story feel so real, my favourite scene was the reunion after a few a years it was the most emotional scene. i admire heath and jake for having the courage to do the movie, they were amazing. and so was the directing, the script and everything..the music was so amazing, it added to the sadness of the movie.  <br />and unlike wat some people say it is not a lame story about \\"gay cowboys\\", it is a beautiful story about forbidden and impossible love and i think nobody should miss this masterpiece
B00005JOE8|5.0|Glancing through the other reviews, I find it funny that most all the focus is centered around politics as the theme of this movie. I think it is about the power of ideas, things any of us can make, and that how one man with an idea can change the world. The way I see it, V represents pure artistic idea, the artist in all of us that wants to be freed (in some more than others). The scene with him emerging from the fire, in my opinion, has nothing to do with him coming from evil or being evil but instead signifies that V (pure artistic idea) was born from the plight of mankind (artists are more sensitive to their surroundings, so therefore if something is wrong around them they will be more pained by it and want to change it). What V focuses on changing (the political ideals of his country) is what most of you are saying the whole theme of the movie is; I say you haven't dug deep enough. I feel this movie shows us how plight in mankind affects true artists more than others who tend to ignore it, and how if you let your pure artistic idea loose, it can change the world for the better. What you focus on changing (politics or whatever) is beside the point. V is trying to remove a certain plight from humanity, is all, and this movie is about trying to inspire us to focus on a plight and do the same. If everyone did their part, then plight would be basically gone, and we'd be in a lot better place to live. <br /> <br />Food for thought. <br />D.S.
0440178002|5.0|I am in love with this book. I would buy this for $40.00 let alone $8. For anybody out there in need of a good read, or just looking for an escape, this book is for you!  <br /> <br />I picked up this book on a Friday and did not but it down until noon Sunday. <br /> <br />This book is enthralling to say the least and James Clavell is(was) just a brilliant author.
0385338686|5.0|This book a reader cannot put down. The author, Sophie Kinsella, is wonderfully talented. I'd read \\"Can You Keep A Secret?,\\" an earlier book, but I like this one better. <br /> <br />A main reason is I understand lawyers and the heroine in this book happens to be one. I've been married to two attorneys, given birth to male children who both are attorneys, I have a daughter-in-law who is an attorney, and on my family tree there is a great-grandfather attorney, a grandfather attorney, and two uncle attorneys. I understand attorneys and what they do, though I chose not to be one. I chose to become a journalist, and the media is also a significant factor in this book. Sophie's characters are therefore totally believable to me. I can understand every one of them: the heroine, Samantha Sweeting, her law firm (God forbid such a firm), her mother (God forbid her, too), her new employers (there's help for them--good--and a hint that Sophie might uplift them while at the same time she's terrified of them), and I absolutely love Nathaniel, the gardener, who is so right for her if she will understand that. I also relate to her struggle to manage a kitchen and keep up a home since I have been a wife and mother. Kinsella writes her entire story with well-thought-out understanding, sensitivity and humor. We need humor like hers, and I loved it in this book. It's a terrific read, speaking accurately about contemporary life with its cell phones and various other electronic gagetry and needless interruptions that we all use and have but wish so often that we didn't. Our heroine, a reader can see after the well-presented introduction, has important decisions to make. Also, I liked Nathaniel's mother, Iris. She reminds me of my own mother and she will be dear to any reader who has had a wonderful mom.
B000641ZA4|1.0|This legendary 16mm film has circulated for years among collectors, and it still remains at the best document of the extraordinary Gabriel's era. It's simply one of the most extremely interesting performances I've ever seen, with Gabriel at his best as theatrical frontman, and with such an excellent voice. <br /> <br />The entire band is mind-blowing, featuring the truly best ever version of Supper's Ready I've ever had the pleasure to watch and listen to. This gem can't keep hidden anymore!. It's clear it was filmed for an official video. By the way, cameras work is simply astounding. What a difference with the stupid MTV style of the today's DVD's!. Both the filming and performance makes Shepperton 1973 more than a Concert video, rather is a treasure, a document of art at its most unique.  <br /> <br />Shepperton 1973 has been unequalled. We need it on DVD! <br /> <br />NOW NOW NOW NOW ... <br /> <br />[...]

B000B2YQX4|3.0|As a DM fan I deffend my band to death, but let's be honest, Playing he angel is not the best album in band's career, it's ok to try another sounds, but sometimes you just can't record a masterpiece. In my opinion last DM's masterpiece was ULTRA. It has been hard for DM to get a high quality standard since Alan Wilder gone, Gore is an excellent songwritter, but I think he needs Wilder to complement the whole DM concept. Playing the angel has quality, it is not a bad album but it isn't excellent, many rookie bands would like to make an album like this...anyway we don't have the best DM in this album.
0679736646|4.0|Sometimes Philip K. Dick gets himself into a more metaphysical, quasi-religious, psychedelic place. UBIK isn't exactly a pure example of any one of those things (all of which Dick played with in his career), but the overtones are there. You can see how books like The Divine Invasion and The Unteleported Man (aka Lies, Inc.) would arrive later. In UBIK, PKD deals with his most repeated theme, the whole \\"What is reality?\\" thing he so often dabbles with, but here we also mix in the afterlife, psychic ability and minor hints of theology. It is, like his best works, a mindfark. <br /> <br />And I wouldn't have it any other way. <br /> <br />UBIK is widely considered one of the better novels by Philip K. Dick, and for good reason: It throws into the mix most of the key elements that make a PKD novel. Highly worthwhile with one of his truly interesting twists, UBIK will keep you guessing and keep you thinking.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are HILARIOUS in this film. Grant plays an absent minded paleontologist profesor whom for the past 4 years has been reconstructing a brontosaurous. He stumbles apon Susan Vance(Hepburn) at a golf course when she steals his ball and life just never clicks back into place. <br /> <br />A hilarious sequence follows as Susan (nuts about him) does anything and everything to keep David in her sights, including taking a tame leopard (baby) to her aunts farm in westlake kineticut where the last bone to his brontosaurous is stolen by the house dog, George. One of the most hilarious scenes ensues when Grant is dressed in a negligee and she asks him why he is wearing such ridiculous clothes and he replies \\"because I just went gay all of a sudden!\\"  <br />Complications spring forth as the pair dig up the garden for the lost bone, search for baby in the woods are thrown in jail and somehow  fall for each other in one of the most adorable ,zany, break neck speed comic farces ever put onto screen!

B00005JOE8|4.0|The directors of the Matrix films bring us V for Vendetta \\"although they just wrote the screenplay and don't direct it\\". The great Hugo Weaving who played Agent Smith in those films stars here and is excellent considering he wears a mask the whole time. He brings charm and class to the role while also makes you feel bad for anyone who has to cross him. He plays a hero/terrorist trying to find justice in a world controlled by an evil dictator.<br /><br />  He isn't your ordinary hero, he doesn't mind killing people what so ever. He goes around killing the people who's fault it is that he got burnt badly and then leaves a rose on their corpse. He gets help from a women played by Natalie Portman who deep down also hates how the world is. Since her parents were taken from her and executed when she was little. Together they try to stop the evil dictator played by John Hurt, as a cop played by Stephen Rea (The Crying Game) trys to track them down and stop V. The movie is dark and very very violent but it also has heart  and a compelling story with romance on the side. It has Natalie Portman giving a better performance than she did in all 3 StarWars prequels. Well although the role is sorta similar to her role in the Professional. Where she falls for her mentore but can never actually be with him.
630407185X|5.0|This movie takes place in WWII where the allies attempt to take a bridge in Holland.While expecting light resistance,they ignored their own intelligence,and realized only too late that two Waffen S.S.armored divisions from the eastern front were being retrofitted there.The allies then suffer horiffic losses thus raising the question of the title of this movie.It also has an all-star cast that makes it all the more worthwhile.While some of the equipment is not 100% accurate(showing that it was diffacult to locate WWII equipment even in the 70's)there is plenty of action that one would expect in a great war movie.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The movie is set in the 60's and is about 2 ranch hands who forge a lifelong relationship. Their \\"love\\" (the word \\"love\\" is introduced at the end of the movie) is thwarted because of internalized social norms. The \\"internalized social norms\\" are played brilliantly by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.    Great acting by all other actors and actresses to the extent that you can see the story through any randomly selected character in the movie.    It gets you thinking: if our social norms when internalized, as all are inevitably, may deny us happiness, what is the meaning of them, are we actually opressed and not even realizing it?    I'm giving it a 5 star review because this is the only movie which made me think in years.    Here's a graph of the opinions at Amazon.     x   X   X   X   X   X X X X X   __________   5 4 3 2 1 stars
0316779237|2.0|I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me.
B00005JOIF|4.0|Well worth watching! Stieven Spielberg shows you he is a master of getting his ideas accross - and they are not what you expect them to be!

B000002KHH|5.0|This album is the breakthrough second album by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath. It topped the charts! Although I think War Pigs would have been a better title but this album still kicks alot of classic ass! Best Songs \\"War Pigs\\", \\"The Title Track\\", Iron Man\\", Eletric Funeral\\". Buy This Album. It Still Around!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|After viewing this movie, it is beyond comprehension to me how it was passed over for Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.  It was one of the best movies to come out last year.  The acting was superb, the music added more depth to a movie that was full of it already and the cinematography was great.  You really felt like you were back in the good ol' days of Nashville.  Joaquin Cash hit it on the nail with his performance of Johnny Cash (I did think it was him during some occasions) and Reese as June...well....she earned that Oscar for a reason. IMO, it was more enjoyable than last year's Ray.  I loved it.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I can only give praise to this amazing album. From start to finish, the sound keeps you wanting more, the mysterious and vibrant sound of the band, capped off by the mesmerizing voice of Thorn Yorke defines this great album. It would be pointless for me to go over every single one of the songs of this album. Some of the highlights of this album:  <br /> <br />Paranoid Android <br />No Suprises <br />Karma Police <br />The Tourist  <br />Electioneering  <br /> <br />Although every single song brings a different element to your listening experience, I must say these get me excited everytime. If your an alternative rock/british rock fan, this album should already be in your collection. Too bad iTunes don't feel the need for Radiohead in its music store.
6305882592|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I first saw it waaaaay back when it came out as a sneak preview movie after seeing Billy Jack.  Since then I have watched it every time I've noticed that it was going to be shown on cable.  The last time I watched it, I decided it was about time for me to see if it was out on DVD.  When I found that it was available on amazon.com, I had to purchase it.   <br /> <br />The music is great; old Cat Stevens tunes and one I had never heard before seeing Harold & Maude:  \\"If You Want to Sing Out Sing Out\\" -- it is simply a joy! <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and own this movie -- watching it will make you feel good!
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|This movie in not so subtle tones explain how a government creates a fake terroist attack to instill fear and patriotism into its people.  Hmmm, just like the true story of 9/11.<br /><br />50 percent of New Yorkers now believe that the government knew or was involved in the 9/11 attacks so they would have a reason to wage war and take away civil liberties.<br /><br />Good job boys.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Phillip Seymour Hoffman won a well deserved Oscar for this movie. He truly is Truman Capote, the legendary writer. We see Capote as a human being, a flawed human being and yet we understand him. I don't know if we can like him, but we do see why he does what he does. To be able to write In Cold Blood he has to lie to the man he's befriended, one of the two persons responsible for the horrible murders in the late 50s. <br />Ms. Keener as Harper Lee is excellent and the script couldn't have been better. Sometimes grim, but an excellent movie.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I put this level on the same level as The Last Starfighter.  Terrible acting, bad special effects.  Not sure why people like this unless its just a space comedy.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Another great 2005 movie. It is nostalgic, filled with songs some of us grew up with. Songs that the newer generation will love too because they're so real. Reese Witherspoon is great as June Carter and Joaquin Phoenix is Johnny Cash. He really is the music legend of the 50s and 60s. Highly recommended.
0895260131|5.0|The title really says it all.  The book is simple to read, but full of information.  Spencer's work should be required reading in EVERY American High School.  If more people would read this, we'd have many eyes opened.

1563899426|5.0|Everyone knows the stories of Snow White, Prince Charming, the three little pigs and the big bad wolf, Little Boy Blue, Beauty and the Beast, as well as the numerous characters named Jack.  Their stories are a part of timeless children's literature that has been told and retold numerous times, but usually, things end happily ever after.  But what happened next?  Bill Willingham's Fables is an entertaining look at these characters after the ends of their stories. <br />The characters from these stories exist in their own magical homeworlds, or at least they did until a being known only as The Adversary came and conquored the lands, one by one.  It seems to parallel the advances of Hitler and Nazi Germany (wait until the fourth issue when they reference the attitudes when Oz and Narnia are taken over, and you'll see what I mean).  Now, these seemingly immortal characters have been forced to relocate to a mundane world filled with mundane people (referred to as mundies).  That world is ours.  The characters have set up a neighborhood in New York City known as Fabletown as well as a camp in upstate New York known as The Farm, which is where characters who cannot pass for human reside.  A government has been set up, with Old King Cole as the Mayor, Snow White as his deputy, Boy Blue as Snow White's assistant, and Bigby Wolf (the Big Bad Wolf, who has gained the ability to take human form, and somewhat resembles Wolverine) as the sheriff.  Other characters we meet include Jack of the Tales, an amalgam of every character named Jack, who is a scheming jerk, Prince Charming, a sleazy, womanizing moocher, and Bluebeard, one of the few fables to retain his riches after being exiled from the homeworlds. <br />This first story arc is a murder mystery about the death of Snow White's sister Rose Red.  Rose is the polar opposite of Snow; she is a partier who lives without responsibility, and seems to enjoy embarassing her sister, who, as deputy mayor, usually can't afford being affiliated with Rose.  With the annual Remembrance Day Festival fast approaching, Snow White and King Cole need Bigby Wolf to find the killer before the celebration.  The investigation opens old wounds for Snow White, as she learns of Rose's promiscuity and is forced to reconfront her ex-husband who may have a reason to have killed Rose. <br />These first five issues are superb on their own, but they seem to foreshadow great events to come, as there are so many things that can be done using these characters.  Furthermore, numerous hints are dropped as to how they plan to deal with The Adversary as well as the shakiness of their supposed safety.  Great things are very likely to come. <br />Another great thing about Fables is its wit and subversive nature.  These characters seem to be immortal, and the exile happened over 200 years ago.  In a scene involving Beauty and the Beast, who were supposed to be madly in love with each other by the end of their story, the Beast says that, despite how much he loves Beauty, there are bound to be some marital problems after so many hundreds of years of marriage.  Furthermore, there are some references to the land of Narnia that perfectly satirize the nature of C.S. Lewis' classic stories. <br />One thing that I have to warn you about is that this is a Vertigo book, meaning that things can get graphic.  Vertigo is a DC imprint that is like the R-rated department of the company.  There is hard cursing, violence, lots of blood, and even graphic drawings of sex (while there is no nudity in this book, I have heard that, in upcoming issues, nudity does become an issue).  This is not a comic book for children. <br />Fables is definitely a worthy read.  It is very entertaining and serves as a fun new way for adults to view these childhood classics.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Fagen has come as close to the Steely Dan sound and vibe as is probably possible with \\"Morph the cat\\".   In fact, the album sounds almost like it could have been the follow-up to \\"Guacho\\".  The only thing really missing from this album is Walter Becker and the flawless background vocals of Michael McDonald. I currently have \\"Katy Lied\\", \\"The Royal Scam\\", \\"Aja\\" & \\"Gaucho\\" permanently sealed in my cars CD Changer. \\"Morph the Cat\\" seamlessly fits in with those four legendary Steely Dan cd's.

0316172324|4.0|This book relates the work of different psychologists and scientists who have done research on the power, benefit, and downfalls of split-second decisions.  This research is combined with the experiences of those involved in the arts, sports, advertising, law enforcement, sales, and other activities.  Gladwell weaves together a work that clearly explains how often split-second decisions are made, even in important matters.  While Gladwell explains the benefits of this decision making, he also highlights the possible pitfalls of quick decisions, such as the different biases that might come into play. <br /> <br />Quote: \\"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few.  It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\\" <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book considerably at the beginning- I learned some new things, thought of things I already knew in different ways.  Although I thought the book began dragging in the middle, to me it was not enough to prevent the book from being enjoyable. <br />

B000EGDC14|5.0|Importing this album at an earlier time, many Goldfrapp fans enjoyed what was and still is an immensely enjoyable album.  In fact it's by far one of the best albums to be released over the past decade imo.  Now just in time with the US release comes the DLX edition which is worth every pennie. Even for those who already own the album.   <br /> <br />Besides the added bonus track \\"beautiful\\" which just makes the album that much sweeter, is the bonus DVD included.  What makes this particular disc better than most is the enclusion of a DTS 5.1 mix of the entire album (excluding the bonus track).  Considering most DTS mixes cost 2-3 times the price of this package, and don't sound anywhere near as good as this, it feels more like a reward and a thank you by the band for the fans. I encourage more bands to go to this effort in the future. <br /> <br />In the end for those who already own this album, do me a favor and give your copy to a friend and purchase this release.  It's time to spread the word that Goldfrapp is the rebirth of true DIVA's like Shirley Manson and Madonna prior.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't understand why this show was cancelled.  It is intelligent, witty, engaging, and can be enjoyed over and over.  Each time I watch an episode I notice more nuance and depth of character.  It is Shakespeare compared to the typical slapstick that is on the TV. (ah, now I understand why it's not on anymore.)  I have shared the DVD set with people from age 25 to 75 and everyone becomes addicted and runs to purchase their own set.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|As a viewer who has seen the stage 3 times, this has got to be the best production EVER of the Phantom of the Opera.  In spite of what some have said, Joel Schumacher has created a hauntingly beautiful movie.  The score is magnificent and the voices are perfectly matched to the characters.  I can't recommend this more highly.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I will give Fagan and Steely Dan a lot of credit for relying scrictly on their musical vision rather then trend hopping.Nothing that Fagan,Becker or Steely Dan have put out since the early 80's has been an exception.That being the case nothing on 'Morph The Cat'sounds dated at all-it has the classic groove sound these guys always do have and could've been made anytime in the last thirty years.It's all very timeless.It's not too surprising either but as always there are subtle differences.A good example is the scaling vocal dynamics of the title song and \\"What I Do\\"-now that tune is a reworking/tribute to Ray Charles that has Fagan's sardonic wit all over it and is rather hard edged.'Morph The Cat' overall is the least optimistic of Fagan's solo releases and it's lyrics explore subject matters such as sadness and politics.The best political song here is the funny \\"Security Joan\\",one of those great funky grooves about Fagan's fetish for an airport security guard-his chants of \\"Frisk me baby\\" have that flavor of 'Royal Scam'-era Steely Dan or 'The Nightfly'.Some songs like \\"The Bright Nitegown\\" are highly repetetive but that can be a good thing too.The slowest tune here is the \\"The Great Pagoda Of Funn\\" and that being said 'Morph The Cat' consists mostly of up to midtempo tunes.No 'Morph The Cat' is certainly not as crowd pleasing as 'The Nightly' or as welcoming as 'Kamakiriad' but is a tad more well written then the most recent Steely Dan release 'Everything Must Go'.So far there seems to be no such thing as 'bad' Fagan or Steely Dan but some release are certainly stronger then others.That went for the 1970's as much as today.That being the case in terms of musicianship and sound music doesn't get much tighter then this.But in terms of Steely Dan/Fagan/Becker material 'Morph The Cat' is balanced between the middle and the best.

0440241588|1.0|When I heard the Broker's plot about a hacker who hacks into a spy satellite, I expected to read about something high-tech. Well the Broker is anything but. The only high-tech stuff that I came across was the smartphone that Joe Backman used. Anything else is loosely organized from the beginning to the end: how the Russian, the Chinese and the Saudis got involve in the Broker's business, why they wanted to take part in the first place, what really happened afterwards, and the way the story ended as if nothing happened. <br /> <br />Reading the Broker was more like reading a Bologna guide book. The flow is not focused around the main theme of spy satellite. Mr. Grisham does not seem to know how to relate the theme to the development of the story. He has to learn from Dan Brown in this aspect.  <br />

B00005JOE8|4.0|Putting aside the political slant on this movie, and the whole Beauty and the Beast aspect, I'd like to just describe the entertainment value I got from it.  Many scenes were engrossing in a video game / graphic novel kind of way, especially the whole back story on how the \\"V\\" avenger character came to be.  Also, I generally appreciated the treatment of the \\"rebellion vs. totalitarian government\\" theme, although it's often been done before, several times in better ways.  A major plot twist about 2/3 thru caught me totally unprepared (most unusual), and really made me think about V's motivations.  The acting by Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant, especially considering it was all done behind a mask.  A few minor parts of the plot were unconvincing, but overall I recommend it.  I saw \\"V\\" for the Matrix creative team connections, and mostly found it a worthwhile experience.
B0006213WG|3.0|Though I did enjoy some songs from Sum 41's metal-influenced 2004 release, I found that it all just got really repetitive. I could never sit through the whole thing. Vocalist Deryck Whibley seems to have resorted to screaming in some of the songs, and though that might win over some metalheads who had disregarded Sum 41 before, it left me a bit confused. Still, some standout tracks made Chuck a solid three star album. They are- <br /> <br />3. We're All To Blame- The first single, the lyrics are well thought out and it's pretty catchy. <br />4. Angels With Dirty Faces- This one's just cool to me. <br />5. Some Say- One of the best on the cd. It's great. <br />8. Slipping Away- This one's kinda soothing to me, I know that sounds corny but it really is soothing. <br />11. Pieces- This ones also great. <br />12. There's No Solution- Pretty Good. <br />13. 88- I love this one. <br /> <br />So, all in all, if you like metal music, you might like Chuck. However, if you like a bit lighter, less serious music, you might want to try their older stuff.
B000001G5H|5.0|We will never hear Chopin's own critique of this performance, but I would imagine he would be just as stunned by Pollini's titanic virtuosity as I was the first time I heard this recording.  Chopin dedicated his opus 10 (etudes 1-12) to none other than Franz Liszt.  I mention this because Pollini plays this opus as though it was written by Liszt. Did Chopin intend opus 10 nos. 1-12 to be played in this Lisztian style?  I would argue yes for the simple reason that this is a set of ETUDES, therefore the use of a mammoth technique is not out of place.  Pollini's performance is captivating in it's accuray and power, as well as it's beauty (listen to opus 10 No.3).<br /><br />  I remember the first time I heard this album.  I was 15 years old, sitting in my parents' minivan in the parking lot of the store at which I had just bought the CD. From the first BOOM of etude op10 No.1 to the last thunderous chord of op25 No.12 I sat transfixed, almost dazed by what I was hearing.  It was a life altering experience for me.  I was a mediocre piano student not too serious about my piano study. Hearing Pollini made me realize the possibilties of the piano and triggered an absolute resolve to master the instrument.  Ten years later, I have mastered all of op.10 and some of opus 25.  The reason I mention my background is I feel that I may offer some insight into what technical problems the pianist faces when tackling Chopin's etudes.<br /><br />Opus 10 No.1 is comprised entirely of r.h. arpeggios with a chorale accompaniment.  On the surface it doesn't sound extraordinarily difficult, but when we delve deeper we find the arpeggios are super wide with intervals of as much as a sixth between thumb and index finger and a fourth between the 4th and 5th fingers! At a tempo of 176! It's insane!!!<br /><br />Opus 10 No.2 also doesn't sound particularly demanding until one realizes that the chromatic scales in the r.h. are played with mostly the 4th and 5th fingers! Try playing a chromatic scale in this way and you will instantly understand the difficulty.<br /><br />Opus 10 No.3 is, by Chopin's own words, I paraphrase, \\"In all my life I have never heard a more beautiful melody.\\"  Apart from the tumultuous middle section and all of its chromatic tri-tones, the<br /><br />piece is easy to play but maddeningly hard to play WELL.<br /><br />Opus 10 No.4 sounds very demanding but is actually one of the easier etudes!  There is lots of chromatic passagework along with quickly modulating descending diminished seventh chords. Proper phrasing and rhythmic control are the keys to mastering this etude.<br /><br />Opus 10 No.5 is arguably the easiest etude.  Its l.h. staccato chords are enveloped by a twirling r.h. accompaniment composed entirely of black keys.  Proper r.h. arm rotation makes this etude totally effortless.<br /><br />(I'll finish my analysis later.)<br /><br />p.s. Garrick Ohlson's recording of the etudes is every bit as good, if not better, than Pollini's.g a chromatic scale in this way and you will instantly understand the difficulty. <br /> <br />Opus 10 No.3 is, by Chopin's own words, I paraphrase, \\"In all my life I have never heard a more beautiful melody.\\"  Apart from the tumultuous middle section and all of its chromatic tri-tones, the  <br />piece is easy to play but maddeningly hard to play WELL. <br /> <br />Opus 10 No.4 sounds very demanding but is actually one of the easier etudes!

078322611X|5.0|Kevin Costner is fantastic as 36 year-old ex-hippie turned Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, husband (his wife is played by Amy Madigan) and father (to one daughter).  Mysterious voices tell him to plow under his corn field and build a baseball diamond and field.  His wife believes in him and his voices, so he does.  His brother-in-law thinks he's nuts, especially when he can't make his mortgage payments and the viewer is inclined to agree with him.<br /><br />During the baseball diamond building project, we learn that Ray Kinsella's father loved baseball and loved his son.  But his son, Ray, felt smothered by his Dad and in keeping with the cultural programming of his day, took off on his own - \\"I'm scared to death of turning into my father\\".  No doubt, he broke his father's heart.<br /><br />Soon after the ball field is built, ghosts from the 1919 Chicago White Sox appear from the adjoining corn field and want to play ball.  Among them is \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson, played by Ray Liotta.  Before long, Ray Kinsella is playing baseball with them.  But to his brother-in-law, who can't see the ghosts, he's bonkers.<br /><br />Then the voices come back one night and tell him to find former sports writer Terrance Mann, played by James Earl Jones, whose libertarian novel \\"The Boat-Rocker\\" was misinterpreted by Ray to stop playing baseball with his Dad.  Ray's farm is about to be repossessed, but his wife supports him - he jumps into his Volkwagen bus and heads east where eventually finds Terrance Mann, then takes him to a ballgame, and then a message appears on the advert screen telling them to track down an old doctor.  They do, and learn that the doc once played pro-ball for one inning.<br /><br />One the way back to Iowa, Ray Kinsella and Terrance Mann stop for a hitchhiker, who turns out to be the doc when he  was a kid.  Back at the Iowa ball field, Terrance Mann is in baseball heaven (literally, since he died back east and it was his ghost that rode back to Iowa with Ray Kinsella).  The doc plays with the White Sox in baseball heaven too, but when Ray's daughter chokes on a hotdog, the doc runs out of baseball heaven to do a tamer version of the Heimlich maneuver and saves her from choking.  Forever a doctor again, \\"Shoeless\\" Joe tells \\"Doc\\" he was good enough to be pro.<br /><br />The finale is when Ray's dad comes out of the corn to play ball with the other ghosts.  He is very young and Ray thinks that his dad doesn't recognise him, saying \\"I only saw him years later when he was worn down by life\\".  He plays catch with his Dad and afterward his Dad asks him \\"Is this Heaven?\\".  Ray says it is Iowa.  He meets Ray's wife and daughter, they exchange some small talk, then he departs.  As the Dad is walking back toward the cornfield where the ghosts come from, Ray calls out \\"DAD?\\".  His Dad stops and looks back.  \\"You want to have a catch?\\"  At this point, the viewer may feel some habernero in his eyes.<br /><br />Cars full of people come to pay money to Ray to sit at his ballfield, a shrine to their memories.  The bank repossessors do not get the farm.  Everything is sentimentally hunky-dory.  This is \\"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\\" film of baseball.ay Kinsella).

B000002UB3|5.0|Every song on this album is perfect and familiar. There really isn't much else I can say about this essential classic.
B00005JO9J|5.0|My family and I have watched Grey's Anatomy since it first aired on ABC.  It is a very intelligent drama that sheds a lot of light into human nature.  I will admit Meredith Grey is a bit whiny but it lends to the vulnerability of her character.  She makes some stupid mistakes but she pays for them.  Each character on the show is so very different.  I am still trying to decide who I can identify with.  I like this series and watching the first season all over again makes me enjoy it even more.  It does add some humor so you will find yourself chuckling from time to time.
B000022TSY|1.0|This was the biggest waste of time and money ever!  I can't understand why it won so many awards.  I guess you have to be a pot smoking hippie to enjoy it!
B000002KHH|1.0|Loud, vocals are non-existent, pure noise. Rock fans are constantly putting down other genres of music, I am a pop fan, I love BSB. But so many rock fans write reviews on BSB telling us try rock in order to hear some \\"real\\" music, so I tried. Oh my gawd...I can see why now rock fans don't like BSB...in order to be a rock fan one must not have a brain cell. I thought the Osbournes was a funny but stupid show so I tried listening to Ozzy's group, now I know why he's so messed up. Come on this cd is not a 5 star unless you are stoned.
B00005JOE8|4.0|if Natalie Portman was a better actress.  You'll probably immediately recall her fake, pained facial expressions from scenes of maudlin excess in the Star Wars prequels (which, of course, were god-awful films, but don't get me started).  And because she appears in so many scenes, and her acting is at best hit or miss, it does take V for Vendetta down a notch.  Which doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, of course.  It's been a long time since we've had such a thoughtful, beautiful, and engaging movie like this, and even more surprising that it would come from the guys who most recently brought us (yawn) the two boring and pseudo-intellectual sequels to the Matrix.  Yep, the Warchowski brothers have written a highly literate, powerful movie that you really should see.<br /><br />Aside from Portman (who does a stretch in a dungeon and comes out looking like a concentration camp survivor -- except that she was just as emaciated before she went in ... does she eat in real life?), the acting is really first rate.  Stephen Fry is sensational as a talk show host with a secret life, Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance from beneath a rigid mask, John Hurt is great as a power-mad 1984-style dictator, Steven Rea is wonderful as a detective with a heart, and Tim Pigott-Smith plays the stern face of evil with aplomb.<br /><br />All this aside, I can't help but believe that many people, blinded by modern propaganda, will mistake the world in V for Vengeance as a thinly veiled stab at the modern United States or the Bush administration.  It obviously isn't.  In fact, only an intellectual adolescent would mistake real totalitarianism for what's going on in the United States, but that discussion is for another place and time.  Moreover, the film also, by dwelling on homosexuality as much as it does (some attention to this is warranted given that sexual freedom is often controlled in totalitarian states, but it almost predominates), dilutes attention from the real victim of oppression:  expression in all of its forms, not just sexual.  Sadly, I think in today's world, however, freedom is more often associated with what a person does with their sexual organs than with the quality of their ideas.  Love is important, and sex is important too, but free thought and realm of ideas are what make us special ... and what we must die to protect if need be.<br /><br />All this, plus a satisfying ending.  Since when have we gotten that?n in all of its forms, not just sexual.

B000002H97|1.0|Rock fans love to critize Backstreet Boys, even writing nasty reviews of their songs. So I thought let me listen to Metallica rock fans are always telling BSB fans try them and you will see what REAL music is....lol. OH MY GOD. if this is what rock fans call \\"real\\" music well I think your brain cells have been desensitized by the very loud guitars and the lousy voices. And what are the lyrics, for half the time  I can't hear them, come on ppl if you rock fans like this crap listen to it I would bet more than half of rock fans have to be high when they listen to this crap. But for me I will continue to enjoy the smooth, melodic, harmonizing of the Backstreet Boys.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|From begnning to end, The Way Up is a master piece in epic, long form music.  I saw him perform the whole thing live and found both the album and the concert to be unique experiences.

1400043662|5.0|Murakami is a master at what he does, and this book is a stunning example of that.  The story is full of wounderful twists and turns that never fail to fascinate.  Murakami has developed his own unqiue method of story telling, one that leaves the reader longing for the next book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is based on the series Firefly and is a great stand alone story as well as a good introduction to the series it's based on.  If you've never seen Firefly, this movie stands as a fine intro and it stands on its own as a good story in its own right.  Even in the short time a movie has to offer itself you have a feeling of history with these characters and you want to know more.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This DVD was wonderful if you are a big Grey's Anatomy fan, such as myself.  It was nice to see all the episodes back to back without commercial breaks.  The first season has a great ending which entices the viewer to watch season two.  I highly recommend this DVD set.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a wonderful show.  If you saw it on network and found it confusing, that's because it was shown out of order.  It's rare that a series can bring nine characters together and have it work.  They are distinct personalities in a very believable future where horsemen are right at home with faster than light travel.  If you're still not sure, rent the series before you buy - or watch Serenity which introduces the characters and environment and see for yourself.  Firefly is a definite keeper!

B0006GAOBI|4.0|2001 cult-film \\"Donnie Darko\\" is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic Slaughterhouse-Five which Billy Pilgrim, becomes unstuck in time. Donnie, a textbook paranoid schizophrenic is \\"spared\\" when passenger-jet engine inexplicably, drops from the sky onto his bedroom, while he is out sleepwalking with Frank, his macabre bunny-suit wearing \\"imaginary\\" friend Frank. Darko explores wild variations on Dr. Hawkings theories on time in a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity. The film is loaded with interesting characters and interesting performances by a host of notable names like: Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze (really), Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA), lead by the talented Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, JARHEADS)as the temporally troubled teen.<br /><br />This 2004 Director's Cut includes, the 80's soundtrack reworked as originally intended (with all of the royalties and paperwork completed), also UK Darkomentary, cult shorts and commentary with director Richard Kelly (he made them do it) and comic-book fan Kevin Smith (who wasn't involved but liked the movie).<br /><br />This version is a great film to both disturb and amuse with its multiple genre nature (teen drama/horror/comedy/sci-fi/ etc.)
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I only recently discovered Michael Buble and really enjoyed watching the concert that he did for PBS. He is a real talent who puts on a super show. I'm anxious to see/ hear more of him. He is almost like a rebirth of Francis Albert Sinatra.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|Look closely before purchasing.  There are NO deleted scenes on this 2-Disc Widescreen set.  Just another load of decent, but redundant documentaries.  And on Disc One, the movie has car commercials and previews right up alongside the film in the menu.  Very shoddy and shameless.  For this amount of money, there should be no ads.  And in this day and age, putting out an \\"Exclusive 2-Disc Special Edition\\" with no deleted scenes is highway robbery and flim flam.  I'm assuming that PJ will be back to the well for some hideous Extended Edition months from now.  But until then, he now outdoes only George Lucas for holding us hostage for deleted scenes.
B00005MP58|5.0|I had borrowed my friend's DVD set to check out before I broke down & bought one of my own.  I'd had hers for about 3 months! <br />        I will NOT watch the remake that was out this year - - Simply WON'T - - Colin Firth is MY \\"Mr. Darcy\\".  He was \\"Mr. Darcy\\" in BOTH \\"Bridget Jones\\" movies - - - NO ONE else could ever measure up. <br />        Amazon.com only sells good \\"gently used\\" DVDs  - I'm grateful.
0553213105|4.0|Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is and will always remain to be an all time favorite romantic comedy in the history of American literature. The story never fails to emphasize on the ethical manners played out in the 19th Century English society, an existence in which wealth, social status, and love prevailed lucidly in pithy marriages. It also differentiates with our human behavior in the modern world, how much we have changed in a sense.<br /><br />The emotions and intentions of the characters in this book are beautifully written and brought to life as they are living life to the rules of respect and manners. I highly recommend this book to all ages interested in reading romantic classics.
0740748475|5.0|C&H is the best comic strip ever printed, bar none. And here it is - all of it, the entire run.<br /><br />Calvin is a very small boy with a very big imagination. He's a dinosaur, he's Spaceman Spiff, and he's supreme leader of his tree-fort club, but he was supposed to be doing his math homework. He advances the art of snow-man construction into new realms of expression, angst, and a few other terms chosen by his school psychologist. He combines sledding, existential philosophy, and ballistics. He plots the downfall of his arch nemesis, Susie, who embodies the world's ultimate evil by being a girl. Hobbes is his tireless companion: sauve, sleek, witty, wise, and quite different in Calvin's world than in the view of anyone else who sees him. In short, Calvin is 100% boy, maybe more, and Hobbes is the only one who understands him. One can only regret that sad day, December 31, 1995, when Calvin and Hobbes went sledding off to that great Best-Of collection in the sky.<br /><br />That little boy and dicey connection to reality are as fresh today as when the comic strip first published. Since Calvin was unconcerned with events outside of his imagination, this has held up much better than more topical strips - funny-then and funny-now aren't always the same, but C&H is both. This magnificent collection is beatifully printed, with a sturdy slipcase. It's a long read, over 1000 pages total, but the kind I'll read again and again, maybe on some rainy Saturday with a big cup of cocoa.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JO9J|5.0|it was so easy and inexpensive to use amazon.com to purchase this DVD.  if you are a fan of Grey's Anatomy you know that the season 1 DVD is a must have!!
0743454537|4.0|I had to read this book for a book club selection.  I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  The characters were developed well enough to keep the focus on the one who mattered - Anna.  It really focused on her feelings and how she was pushed into the background because of her sister's illness.<br /><br />As for the ending - kudos to Picoult for writing something other than what we all expected or wanted to read.  A twist or turn here and there is good for us.  Life isn't perfect...it dosen't always end the way we would write it.
B000E1155E|5.0|This is the first time I've reviewed a product on Amazon, in part because the last time I felt this strongly about a group of entertainers, it was before Al Gore invented the internet & I was sitting in my college dorm room watching the second season of Sienfield, wondering why no one was paying attention to such obvious brilliance.    For a while, I thought MTV more or less killed rock music by pushing image over talent.  With a couple exceptions (the Strokes & Oasis) nothing really has appealed to me over the past 15 years.  Then, about a year ago I heard Franz Ferdinand, then the Killers, then Block Party & most recently the Arctic Monkeys, who are the best of the bunch.  Collectively, these bands are creating some of the best music I've ever heard by mixing elements of new wave music, classic rock, punk rock & disco into an unbelievable sound.        \\"Whatever People Say I Am Thats What I Am Not\\" is the deepest, most complete album I've heard since the Joshua Tree. Give it more than one listen.  It wasn't until the third or forth time through that I really got into it & it gets better with every listen.  There isn't a single lowlight on the album.  In my opinion, the last 5 songs are the best.
B000AP04FG|4.0|two wondeful stars on one of the best action shows, excitement, love, lust, action taking us high up in the stars! FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!
0671027387|3.0|As with The Da Vince Code, a suspension of reality is absolutely necessary to get through this fast paced thriller.  Read it the way you might watch some Hollywood blockbuster film.  The characters suit their purposes well, though are not very deep.  I liked the continuous action and the plot unfurled nicely for the most part.  I found myself laughing aloud two or three times when something absurd happened to get the story out of the corner it was drawn into in the name of building excitement.<br /><br />All in all, I wasn't impressed, nor was I disappointed in having spent the time.  Hence the 3 stars.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|In this, avrils second album, she vears away from the acoustic folk roots that she started to establish in her first album. This however does not meen her mood has changed. She is still the same old avril, singing about relationships, and having that generally grumpy teenage feeling to her persona. <br /> <br />     In her third track of the album, \\"dont tell me\\", she sticks to her rebellious image and firmly states that she will do what she wants. the begining of this song sounds quite nice with the drums and an acoustic, but when it comes to the chorus, she goes for the tight rockier feel. i think that her voice is good enough to be displayed without the need to go heavy rock. <br /> <br />     I think that the tracks \\"how does it feel\\", \\"nobody's home\\" <br />and \\"fall to pieces\\", showcase her tallents perfectly, with only the latter having to resort to steering to heavy rock a little, in the chorus's. <br />      <br />     The only track that to me, warants the use of a rock feel is \\"who knows\\" as is starts in the first verse light with just an acoustic. When the chorus comes and follwed by the other verses, rock is the dominant genre, but i believe this does not spoil the feeling of avril's voice, it quite subtely compliments it.
B00005JOWR|5.0|Thank You for Smoking is the debut feature film from Jason Rietman (son of famed director Ivan Rietman.) So one might initially wonder if someone might be calling in a favor at the studio to get this one made. But, if that was the case, it doesn't matter, because this movie is not only funny but also smart - really smart.<br /><br />If I were to take the stance that you shouldn't see this film, I would have to prove that you shouldn't see it; since I can't possibly prove that, I must be wrong; so you should go see the movie - and so follows the logic that is Thank You for Smoking.<br /><br />The film, based on the 1994 novel by Christopher Buckley of the same name, introduces us to Big Tobacco spin artist Nick Naylor (played by Aaron Eckhart), who truly is gifted at what he does. So good is he, at what he does, that you might just find yourself buying a pack of cigarettes for your own six-year-old after watching him do his thing. But this film isn't just a vilification of the tobacco industry. No, that would be too easy, and that's where the film truly shines. It's about the sleazy congressmen who support Big Tobacco, the sleazy congressmen who oppose Big Tobacco, and the sleazy parasites that will feed off anything juicy no matter how wrong it is. The fact that Buckley and Reitman are able to present a topic like this and resist the temptation to take a side is a feat rarely seen in this day and age.<br /><br />Although the film is somewhat exaggerated, it's really not that far off from the sad state of affairs that is the way our society currently functions. So you can laugh when you see it, and cry on the way home, well, if you're not too busy deviously contemplating how to employ your newly acquired talents of persuasion.<br /><br />Check out [...] for my latest movie reviews.

B00005JOE8|5.0|Before I start my review, I feel I should disclose to you this; I am a huge Alan Moore fan. For those of you not familiar with Alan Moore, he revolutionized the comic book industry back in the early 80s by blurring the distinction between the good guys and the evil-doers they pursue. Two of his works in particular are legendry, Watchmen and V for Vendetta. However, the two previous attempts to adapt his work, From Hell (2001) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), were both cinematic disappointments, both mutilated after they left Moore's hands. But this time around the Wachowski Brothers, who we know as the guys responsible for the Matrix films, are at the helm, and if anybody should have a feel for how to treat this material, it's them. Plus with last year's Sin City and A History of Violence bringing the \\"comic book movie\\" to a new level, getting your hopes up for a movie in this genre is no longer just for the adolescent.<br /><br />V for Vendetta was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in Britain and didn't hit North American shores until 1988, when DC Comics (owned by Warner Bros.), reprinted it in the form of a 10 issue mini-series, as a follow up to Watchmen. For some years now, Warner Bros. has been tryng to turn both V and Watchmen into films, and now V for Vendetta is finally here.<br /><br />The Wachowski Brothers leave familiar territory to take us down a new rabbit hole in V for Vendetta; this time, attempting to free our minds in a much less virtual world. The lead character V (played by Hugo Weaving of The Matrix trilogy) is a vigilante striking out against an oppressive Orwellian government in Britain's near future, with the help of a young television production assistant named Evey (played by Natalie Portman). V dons a mask depicting the caricature image of Guy Fawkes and picks up where this English folkhero left off hundreds of years before. If you don't happen to be an aficionado of British culture, Guy Fawkes attempted to destroy London's House of Parliament in 1605 with some two-and-a-half tons of explosives. He was, however, caught, and then hanged, and then drawn, and then quartered - a very nasty death indeed. The Brits now celebrate this occasion every year on Guy Fawkes Night (the 5th of November) much like we celebrate the 4th of July.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving's portrayal of V captures your attention with a chilling verse reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe in his grand entrance, and doesn't let go until the final credits role. The conviction Weaving is able to convey through an inert mask is simply mesmerizing.<br /><br />The stunning futuristic world that rookie director James McTeigue has captured is almost a little too real in this riveting film. In fact, you could probably take nearly any random 30 second clip from this movie and it would serve as an intriguing preview. V for Vendetta should evoke an emotional response in everyone that sees it, whether that be the inspiration to think for one's self or utter disgust at the film's bleak political message. For myself, it evoked delight.<br /><br />Check out [...] for my latest movie reviews.e of Parliament in 1605 with some two-and-a-half tons of explosives.

In fact, you could probably take nearly any random 30 second clip from this movie and it would serve as an intriguing preview. V for Vendetta should evoke an emotional response in everyone that sees it, whether that be the inspiration to think for one's self or utter disgust at the film's bleak political message. For myself, it evoked delight.    Check out [...] for my latest movie reviews.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am one of few people I know that loves ALIEN 3.  To rediscover it here, with the rest of the films in the series, was a treat indeed.  FOX has pulled out all of the stops and created one of the greatest box sets of all time.  There are endless extras and even archived material from the original special edition Laserdiscs from the first two films.  Each film has been restored in original theatrical form and then with a special edition (Cameron's ALIENS and Scott's ALIEN had been available before, on Laserdisc and theatrically, respectively) but the real find for me especially is the new look that ALIEN 3 gets.  David Fincher's directorial debut was a mess at the start, but the workprint version we get to see (by no means definitive or a director's cut, as Fincher had no involvement in this release at all) rounds out what he was trying to attempt and gives us an all around better film.  All that aside, bravo for everything this disc includes, even though I could have done without ALIEN RESSURRECTION (what works in Joss Whedon's other works doesn not work here, and even the talents of Jean-Pierre Jeunet are squandered in a basic rehashing of all things ALIEN).  Despite that, if you are a fan of the series, this box set is a must.
0307263118|2.0|I enjoy novels of lyrical prose and non-linear narrative, but I can't stand this book.  What many are praising as imaginative and hyper-observant I just see as contrived and distractingly metafictional.  That is, I sense the author's hand in every line I read from this book.  So for me, no matter how profound the author's statement, I can't enjoy the reading because it seems to me that the author wants so badly for us to know that he is being profound.  For lyrical prose, I would recommend the obvious, Nabakov.  For nonlinear narrative, try Amitav Ghosh's The Shadow Lines.  Both authors have a far more natural and therefore enjoyable style.
B000069KE0|2.0|This was one of my favourite records growing up as a kid and I wore my father's vinyl out.  Needless to say that I know the album inside and out and I was so excited when Rhino started reissuing the entire Chicago catalogue.  II was the one of the last albums I bought as I had already picked up the DVD Audio version of the disc which is flat out INCREDIBLE.  Much to my dismay did I then discover that the same care taken to remaster the other Chicago albums was not bestowed upon the CD release of II.  I had always thought that, compared to the rest of the band's catalogue, II was not recorded as well or as clearly.  The mix always seemed a bit muddy and details would get lost.  This was rememdied in the DVD Audio version I purchased wherein I was able to hear things in the recording I had never heard before.  I assumed that this remastering process had originated with the CD remaster but this is not the case.  If you want to really listen to this album, by all means pick up the DVD Audio version.  I even recommend transferring that version down into a CD if you so desire because even though the packaging is as smart as usual the audio does not hold up.
0141301066|5.0|Matilda  By: Roald Dahl  Reviewed by N.Thakor  Period 1 <br /> <br />    This story is about a young girl who is magnificently gifted. She is very smart indeed from when she was just a little baby. Her favorite hobby was reading books. Her parents never supported her. They always thought she was wise alek and a troublemaker. Unbeknownst to them she was one of the smarteset children on earth and could use her noggin to move things with her mind telepathically. Her father finally gave in and he told matilda she could go to a real school. The teacher was very nice and her name was ms.honey. The meanest teacher of all was ms. trunchbull. She was the principal and lived to torture students. Matilda and ms. honey both hated her and they used their special talents to make ms. truncbull's life so miserable, she never came to the school again. In the end Matilda went to live with ms. honey and they both lived happily ever after. <br />    I really liked the book beacause it spoke to me in a way only spoke some books could. The moment I picked up the book i was immediatley hooked to it. I looked up at the clock it was 4:00 P.M and i started reading at 1:00 P.M! I loved this book because this is kind of the way my life is. A lot of people think i am just a weirdo, but i am really smart and funny once you get to know me. Overall I really liked this book because it related to me personaly and emotionaly. <br />    To tell you the truth, i really didnt find anything bad or anything to critisize in the truly magnificent book Matilda. I thought everything was ship shape and were it needed to be. I am not a real picky person about books, if i think it is agood book , even though some parts stink, i still finish it. Even from someone else;s point of view this book was good beacause it had everything a powerful novel needed and more. This is defenietly one of the best pieces of literature i have ever read in my life so far. <br />    My favorite part of the book was when Matilda foundout she had mental powers. It was like opening up a sequel to the book beacause so many things happened when she found out she had the power to move things with her mind. On that basis, hte entire book changed dramatically, and it opened a whole new world for matilda and her friends. Ms. Honey invited Matilda to her home and told her thar the trunchbull was her aunt, and this shocked matilda deeply. You see, just on that one scene in the book the entire story and plot changed, that was my favorite part of this magnificent book. <br />     <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Our entire family is hooked on this series, from my 14 yr old daughter to my 17 yr old son.  We usually are not into Sci-Fi, but this series is so well crafted and the characters balance each other so well, that one cannot help but get hooked.   A perfect balance of irreverance and morals.  A must buy.
B000002UAO|5.0|By 1965, Beatlemania was slowly coming to a close. The band was beginning to grow tired of audiences filled with girls that were screaming so loud that they couldn't even hear themselves play. The Beatles were extremely busy the past two years to say the absolute least. Rubber Soul showed the band moving past their typical and simple poppy love songs and into more arty and complex work. The material here is still simple compared to an album like Sgt. Pepper, but it definitely gives us a glimpse at what was to come. <br /> <br />Drive my Car is a nice upbeat opener. A typical sing-along Beatles tune. \\"Beep beep, beep beep yeah!\\" That line always sticks with me. Nice little guitar solo in there, and Paul plays some good piano. Michelle is a calm and relaxing ballad. Paul was born to sing these kinds of songs, I tell you! Girl is a nice little soft song by John. He sounds very emotional here, almost as if ready to break down. Very different from earlier love songs they had written. Wait is a catchy little rock song. I think the band just threw it on at the last minute, but I still like it. The Word is another catchy, happy-sounding song. Man, these guys sing so well together! More great piano by Paul, and George Martin (producer) even throws in some melodic harmonium playing. I'm Looking Through You is quite well-known, one of my favorites by Paul. Yes it is a relationship song, but it is more introspective, rather than just \\"I love you, be with me forever\\" type of stuff.  <br /> <br />What Goes On has vocals by Ringo. Ringo was a big fan of country, and it shows on here. This is a nice country flavored tune, and even though I am not a big country fan, I enjoy this song. It is fun to sing along to! Run for Your Life has some of John's darkest lyrics. It's kind of creepy because the song sounds so happy, but the lyrics are far from happy. Nevertheless, I enjoy this song a lot. You Won't See Me is one of my favorite Beatles songs, it is unfair how underrated it is! Paul's voice just fits the song so well, I really wish more people knew about this song.  <br /> <br />Think for Yourself is a great George tune (in my opinion, this album is where George's songwriting got MUCH better). Great to sing to, and Paul adds some cool fuzz bass. Helps the song to stand out! Nowhere Man is the first Beatles song that had nothing to do with relationships, and it is a great, melodic tune! Very introspective, it sort of hints at the lyrical genius that would burst out of John quite soon. In my Life is a beautiful song that all Beatles fans probably know. The atmosphere is a bit more downcast, very powerful. George Martin plays some wonderful piano in the middle of the song. Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) is a dark song with some incredible sitar work by George. John's vocals here are very good, and George's sitar adds so much emotion. Could this be the roots of world music? Well, George got even more into Indian music on later Beatles songs, but I think the roots lay right here, I mean he had to start somewhere. Speaking of George, his other song on here is If I Needed Someone. It is a magnificent song, it defintiely brings the Byrds to mind. George plays the guitar so skillfully here, I would love to know how he gets that sound! <br /> <br />Well there you have it. Rubber Soul shows a young band growing into mature musicians that were way beyond their time. Just one short year later, the band would offer another compelling masterpiece in Revolver, and it was so different than anything that anyone had done, even Rubber Soul, the album that preceded it! And then came Sgt. Pepper, the work of art that shall forever stand the test of time....but those are other reviews. <br /> <br />This album really deserves to be heard by all, it is a great album that foreshadows the creativity that would explode from the band not long after. Five stars just isn't enough, more like five hundred! And make sure you get the U.K. version. Enjoy! (How can you not?)
B000B5IPLK|4.0|This moving rockin cd is off the hook and Alicia Keys makes some good music at her 3rd album Unplugged. Unnbreakable is one of my favorite songs on this album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Was this review helpful to you?
B00005JCAA|5.0|This movie is easily in my top five movies of all time. The acting, along with the story and sets is far better than 99.9% of the crap Hollywood puts out today. It's a shame it's such a sleeper hit but it looks like I'm not alone in my love with this movie. The movie contains wonderful outlooks on life, love, and dealing with our eventual death, something our society doesn't like to talk about, but this movie approaches skillfully and subtly.   <br /> <br />If it wasn't for some sabotagers giving 1 stars just to mess this system up I wouldn't be surprised if it made a full 5 stars instead of the 4.5 it has now.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Takes awhile to become familiar withs the selections but the stories are all interesting, especially  after you hear them a few times.  Liked \\"Lonnie Donnigan\\" the most.
B00005JN0T|4.0|In its own rite, this is a good sci-fi movie; but Asimov, himself, was adamant about the inflexibility of the Three Laws.  One story had a robot that had a modified First Law because the humans he worked with were always exposed to danger.  To have a story where the laws were completely violated is not even close to his original writings. <br /> <br />When I met him in Philadelphia, I asked Isaac whether he ever considered writing a story about a robot being altered without the Three Laws.  He was very adamant that he would never do that. <br /> <br />Hollywood should also have never done that.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|For all the people in the world who would never have been able to see Phantom of the Opera except for this fabulous movie let me just say that you have seen the best part of it.  The stage version and the Opera singing were really not as moving as the film version.  I watched it many times and I am so moved by the charactors and music every time.  The movie has more depth and is much better than paying $200.00 for a ticket to see it on Broadway and then not having it to watch again.  Believe me, the movie is awsome and worth owning.
B00011F5DK|5.0|A lot of fun for all ages!  Very easy to play five games in a row!  Everyone in our family loves it!
B000040OBS|2.0|O.K., There is no doubting that Suicide was a big influence on what would happen in the early 80's. I don't think people were pissed of with them for lack of guitars or drums. It was simply more of a provocative endurance test where the artistic statement became more important than music. I love Captain Beefheart and The Residents and such. But Suicide (along with Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music) is just not that much fun to listen too unless you need bragging rights for just being able to endure the pain that this record dishes out. <br /> <br />
0143034901|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. The characters are written about in great depth; they were all so colorful. This was a book read for a book club, I probably would never have picked it out for myself, but I am so glad that I read it.
B000002KDG|5.0|Neil at his best... simple songs with great melodies... the recordings have a very raw and intimate feel... the album has a universal appeal that allows it to cross over many different genre... if you want to learn harmonica, this is a great album to buy... fun and easy to play along with. <br /> <br />I am also a big fan of the 70s progressive rock era... I applaude Neil, appreciate his contribution to an important period in the american rock scene... but don't understand a review that would praise Neil and simotaniously attack the legacy of a band like Kansas... trust me, you can love both!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I found 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' riveting and so close to the truth of what occurs when one becomes occupied with beings that exist beyond our living construct. <br /> <br />What struck me initially was that anything to do with the idea of possession is surrounded by religious dogma. I believe there was a time when humanity became aware of these forces, shadow forces, and then these shadow forces themselves, through minor and major possessions through the centuries, have convinced humanity that there is a god.  <br /> <br />This within itself is the most unique maneuver of these shadow beings, and it works to diffuse ones personal power because of the belief that there is a god so that we may give all of our strength and power to that illusion, instead of identifying the power that lies within all of us. <br /> <br />The story portrayed that when one challenges these entities, they are confronted by a being that looks as if it is a man standing cloaked within shadow, and this is the challenge that these beings will present if one has the courage to confront these entities, as portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br />I know this to be a truth. I have seen these inorganic beings in this form after discovering them. <br /> <br />The film also portrayed another truth; that once this challenge has been presented, that individual must make it known that they have been challenged, otherwise their onslaughts will continue for a lifetime, and beyond. <br /> <br />For those of you who are interested in sorcery and the teachings of Juan Matus, this film will reveal a surprising truth at the end; an irrefutable truth that a warrior will recognize. <br /> <br />For those of you who do not believe that these beings exist; I will say from my own experience, I have seen the things that this film has presented. I have also heard the demonic cry from one that has been captured and possessed,  and this also for me was an irrefutable truth within this film. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film; not for its religious content, but for the truths that have been displayed. <br />
B000002VMH|5.0|this Cd was great music sounded really terrific!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Sincerely <br />TS,Mo
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Firefly the Series has been one of our favorites.  And Serenity links perfectly into it.  The movie includes all the main characters, which we have come to love, even Shepard and Inara.  It rounds out the series and leaves you wanting more, even though it does not seem likely.  A definite must for the Firefly fan.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|the song Tunnel\\"s from this album is really Fantastic I had never heard about this band until I visited [...] because this band is one of Dan Radcliffe\\":s favorites and its Fantastic!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Sincerely <br />TS,Mo

B0002OERI0|5.0|Like the title says, This recording is the best CD I have heard in years. Cutting edge rock and roll. this band is here to stay, They could be the next U2 in terms of influence and clout. BUY THIS CD. This band is one of the best and I believe they rank right up there with the Likes of REM, The Who, U2 and The Clash.
B00005JOWF|1.0|Ultraviolet follows the exploits of Violet, played by Milla Jovovich, in a futuristic society in which many citizens are infected with a virus, and then are immediately \\"disposed of\\" by the government.  Those infected with the virus are called hemophages, or vampires.  In this movie, however, the hemophages don't literally suck the blood from people, they use other sources, such as blood banks or what not to retrieve their fuel.  Violet is a hemophage, who has decided not to take it anymore, and she joins up with a hemophage resistance group.  When the humans discover a \\"weapon\\" that will destroy all hemophages, the hemophages send in Violet to retrieve the weapon before the government can use it.  When Violet discovers that this weapon is really a young boy, she decides to betray everyone she's ever known for some random child that she knows nothing about.<br /><br />First, let me start with the positives of the film.  Firstly, the film is visually stunning.  It looks very similar to Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium, but Ultraviolet is a lot more colorful than the dark environment of Equilibrium.  Secondly, the action scenes in the film actually aren't all that bad.  The first 20 minutes of the film is straight up action, and after that point, I actually had my hopes up a little bit.  Yes, the effects look fake most of the time, but the film was obviously trying to look like a comic book, and it succeeds in that aspect.<br /><br />Now, the negatives, which are fairly numerous, so I will try to be brief.  The first, and worst, negative of the film is the acting.  Simply put, it is horrendous.  Milla Jovovich has never been known for her acting ability, but that is why she is normally in films that really require no emotion from the leading lady.  Unfortunately, the writing in this film requires Violet to actually show emotion and caring for this boy that she is protecting.  It isn't just Jovovich's lack of acting ability, though, it is also the inept script that Kurt Wimmer put together.  One second, Violet is portrayed as an extremely lethal, uncaring vampire, who will kill anyone in her way.  The next moment, and for no reason, we are supposed to believe that Violet would betray everyone she's ever known just after seeing the boy,  not even talking to him or finding out exactly why he is considered a \\"weapon.\\"  The \\"Archcardinal,\\" the villain, is also a horrible actor.  I don't even know this guy's name, and I never want to.  Portrayed as the classic movie villain, he has so many cheesy lines that just make you want to laugh, no matter how serious the film is trying to be.<br /><br />It is also amazing how the film drags in the middle.  Even though the film runs a meager 85 minutes, it seemed like it was at least two hours long, and that is really unbelievable.  When there isn't action occurring onscreen, it is pointless dialogue about a plot that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about, except for a brief overview by Violet at the beginning of the film.  Ultimately, I just found myself sitting in the theater, just waiting for the film to finally come to the end, and when it did, I was overjoyed.<br /><br />The really sad thing about the film is that the basic setup could actually be used to make an interesting, possibly good movie.  I think that Wimmer was trying to send a message through the film, as he did with Equilibrium, but he failed as a filmmaker on just about every level in this film.  Whatever message Wimmer was trying to send, it was completely lost in the grade-school acting, boring dialogue, and ridiculously overdone (but enjoyable) action scenes.  Her name is Violet, and she is in a movie that you definitely won't understand (or like).hat Kurt Wimmer put together.

B0002S947K|5.0|I heard \\"Trouble\\" on a local college radio station and knew I had to hear more.

B00005JOFO|5.0|First off let me just say, wow, everyone was right, as a straight male I can truly say this movie touched me in a way no other film ever has. BBM definately deserved the Best Picture Oscar, and what makes me mad is that I really liked Crash, but thanks to the Academy I cant watch it without thinking, how could they choose this over a masterpiece like Brokeback. <br /> <br />So most of you already know the story so I'll tell you about how this film affected me. My girlfriend wanted to go see this movie last week and I was actually pretty excited. I saw the previews and thought wow finally something original from Hollywood after a year full of crap. So we went and after the movie was over there were of course people crying but I didnt know what to feel, I thought the ending sucked but the acting was pretty good. <br /> <br />Then I found myself thinking it over on the ride home, and all night I dont think I said more than two words to my family, and then as I was getting ready to go to sleep I started to tear up, I called my gf and she had the exact same reaction. Brokeback is a movie that definately touches you, not because its a gay romance, but because its a beautiful parable about loneliness, love, and what it means to be a man. I was reading a review about BBM and what it said was true. BBM was needed because the gay community has become a joke in this country, sure shows like Will and Grace and Queer Eye are out there but it just reinforces the stereotype that all gay men are fashion obsessed, feminine, and funny. Well I have gay friends, and most of them are just like me, theyre regular guys who do manly things and who just so happen to be attracted to other manly man because God made them that way. BBM definately does a lot of good in showing a more realistic side to the gay community. <br /> <br />So like I said I hated the ending at first, then I went back to see it this week because I couldnt stop thinking about it, and it was even better the second time, Irealized that by ending the way it does BBM shows the courage and strength that gay men have to go through to come out. I found myself asking that if I were gay would I have had the courage to give up everything I ever knew to be with the person I loved. Honestly I dont know if I could, I can sympathize with Ennis because I grew up in his situation, my father and mother have always preached against the sins of the world, including homosexuality, I dont know how Id ever be able to tell them if I were gay. Likewise almost everyone has that doubt that Ennis has, that wish that you had done something to make you happy instead of making everyone else happy, wheter its pursuing a relationship, career, or dream, we all have our regrets in life. What gets to me the most and what caused me to become one of those weeping audience members at the end of the second viewing was that Ennis does what he does in order to protect Jack, and unfortunately it kills him. I truly believe it wouldve been different had Ennis & Jack bought that ranch. <br /> <br />The acting is phenominal, Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest screen preformances in history as Ennis Del Mar. Phillip Hoffman won the Oscar this year and I really liked his preformance, but Heath has so little to work with and yet is so heart wrenching. He's able to convey so much by just saying \\"Jack, I swear\\" than most actors could show in a whole film. Expect this role to pop up on AFI's list of greatest preformances sometime very soon. Michelle Williams is also a revalation, that scene where she sees Ennis and Jack kissing and essentially sees her world crashing down is so powerful without being showy, and Academy I have a serious complaint, Rachel Weisz, WTF? To say that her preformance was better than Michelle's in Brokeback and Amy Adams in Junebug, you have got to be kidding me, guess being pregnant buys you some serious points doesnt it. Now as for Jake Gylenhaal, the first time I saw BBM I actually didnt understand him, he didnt seem to have any sadness at seeing Ennis go that summer except for when hes in his truck, than I realized why, he was being strong for Ennis, he was essentialy saying im your rock. Its a tough preformance that you have to see more than once to truly appreciate but Jake nails it perfectly. Anne Hathaway as Lureen isnt really given much to work with, but that phone call with Ennis shows shes way more than just a one note actress. <br /> <br />Yes, im rambling but its because BBM touched me so much its hard not to praise this film. For all those giving it one stars, you obviously havent watched the movie, because its so much more than two guys having sex, which by the way probably consists of 30 seconds of screen time and almost no nudity save for a shot of Jacks butt which if you cant handle that than how did you ever get through the gym class locker room. Also for all those saying homosexuality is a sin, and BBM glorifies it, the characters end up heart broken and alone, if anything its an anti-gay film, or at least would be if the scenes between Jack and Ennis didnt show that these two men obviously love each other completely, and I was raised Catholic, I believe god loves every one of us and gay people are born that way, and I think theyre put on this earth to teach us what real love is.  <br /> <br />Brokeback is definately an instant classic, and will go in my DVD collection right next to Citizen Kane and Million Dollar Baby as my all time favorites. And for those who felt it got shafted at the Oscars, dont worry, Citizen Kane, the greatest movie of all time got 1 Oscar for its screenplay, theres no doubt in my mind that BBM will be remmembered far longer than Crash, and that it will be way up on the AFI's list of the greatest movies of all time.
B0000B1OGD|5.0|James Fransicus can't act. He tries hard though and that's a good thing. It's fun watching him try and try. But he doesn't matter, just like a preacher matters not in church during the rapture... there is no preacher at that point, is there? And the rapture in the case of Valley of the Gwangi is the last half of the movie when all the cowboys, Fransiscus one of them, gets chased by Harryhausen's dinosaurs. The meanest of these prehistoric nasties is a big purple T-Rex. He's related to Barney, perhaps; I haven't seen that many other purple dinosaurs... But this is no Barney... He's a mean motorscooter and it's just amazing seeing this Rex battle cowboys and one scene in particular that's very, very nice is when the cowboys actually pull off lassoing this big purple brute, sticking him in a cage, and bringing him back \\"home\\". Then they take him to town and display him in front of many people (in a bull ring) and he gets mad and breaks free and reeks havoc ala King Kong. Mean Purple Dino even battles a Harryhausen elephant that looks fantastic. There's also a small horse in the film that's the size of a toy, and it's a little corny, but it doesn't matter because of Ray Harryhausen and his awesome stop-motion effects, making this flawed film into one heck of a masterpiece... as Ray does so well.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|Okay, I'm not hatin' because Alicia really does have big-time talent.  She's singing and playing the piano at a time in the industry when more female vocalists are spending time strippin' and posin' -- tryin' 2 distract you from the fact that they don't have skills.    Alicia, thankfully, isn't in that category. Outside of Beyonce, she's probably the next best female artist of the decade.    I own this CD and it's not bad, but it's not all that compelling or passionate once you get past her radio singles \\"If I Ain't Got You,\\" \\"Karma\\" and the catchy, luscious \\"You Don't Know My Name.\\"    I do believe this album is an improvement over her debut CD, but overall this album doesn't tickle my fancy like a Mary J. Blige, Lauryn Hill, Faith Evans, Jill Scott, Janet Jackson or Aaliyah CD.    I'm not saying this LP is bad ... just as an LP, it doesn't hold my interest song-to-song.
0446677450|3.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad had some idea that I thought were ok, but most of them were obvious.  Mr. Kiyosaki's story telling ability was what I liked about this book.  His told his main theme of \\"getting out of the rat race\\" repeatedly through various examples.  His methods seem to rely heavily on going into business for yourself and real estate.  In his case - he combined the two.  This method has worked (look at Donald Trump), but it is not the ideal method for novice or risk-adverse investors.  I gave this book 3 stars because I felt that the price was not worth the information contained inside.

0553573403|4.0|I found this book to be an exercise in what most authors eventually want to do to their characters, which is to torture them relentlessly.  I have started to read the sequel, and I think I am starting to notice a pattern.  Through the first 200 pages, you have trouble bringing yourself to read another page.  It is so painful watching some these characters get punished for living (living?).  The rest of the book leads into wondering if the character will somehow extract themselves from these predicaments, knowing most likely they won't, but curious enough to have a hard time putting the book down.<br /><br />I recommend this for those who enjoy a good tale and not necessarily fantasy fans.  This book really emits a great feel of political intrigue and battle.  However if you want a feel good story this is not it.
B000005AYM|4.0|Badu's the last of what I personally considered to be THE breakout, defining ladies of 1990s R&B.  Each brought something new (and/or came with a certain style/flavor FIRST in the '90s) to the table.    As much as D'Angelo gets credit (and rightfully so) for jumpstarting the late '90s/early '00s Neosoul Movement, I really felt like Erykah was part of that pioneering clique with this 1997 debut LP.    In my book, Badu was the first female singer to incorporate the jazzy, bluesy element of the old days with contemporary hip hop and R&B.    Before, Lauryn Hill (solo anyways), India.Arie, Alicia Keys and Jill Scott, Erykah was holdin' it down solo on this tip.    \\"Baduizm\\" is the album that brought the comparisons of Badu as the reincarnated version of Billie Holiday.    Highly recommended LP!    Joints to check for on this album:    1)\\"Next Lifetime\\" -- A story of reincarnated love (this was also arguably one of the decade's top videos ... pitting Badu as torn in a love triangle with Method Man and Andre 3000).    2) \\"On & On\\" -- the special, unique \\"Baduizm\\" life perspective gets broken down.    3) \\"Appletree\\" -- you just gotta hear this one to understand.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|I was at first biased against this CD by the Gavin Wilson comment \\"sheer confectionary\\" yet purchased the CD because I love the PMG. Yet after a few listenings I understood why there was no \\"musical statement\\" like other CDs from PMG make: How do you hold the attention of listeners for 68 minutes? Instead this piece flows like a flag in the wind, changing all the time. It is a different way to make music and I think you have to give it a chance to appreciate it. Overall, I think it does show that Pat and Lyle have matured musically and in their compositional thinking. I wish the newness of the Introduction would've been demonstrated more throughout the work because the rest of the CD is obviously PMG music, but it is a very good CD.

B000AWYOGE|5.0|When I heard about this movie, I thought it was just another The Ring, but it wasn't. If you want somethings scary and gory, go watch something else because this movie doesn't have that. Instead, it's full of emotions. The acting is excellent. And the ending can melt your heart. This is not another horror movie. I'll check out the Japanese version of Dark Water to see if it's as good as this one. Absolutely five stars for Ariel Gade and the crew.

B000002UUX|5.0|Rust In Peace (1990.), Megadeth's fourth studio album<br /><br />Megadeth are without doubt one of the defining bands of thrash metal as well as one of the all time great metal bands. When Dave Mustaine was booted out of Metallica prior to the recording of 'Kill 'Em All' in 1983, no-one expected the guitarist to form a legendary band, despite his claims that his new band would be better than Metallica. Megadeth's rise to greatness though was one filled with problems and constant difficulties. The band abused alcohol and drugs in massive proportion and despite producing a great album in 'Peace Sells...' in 1986, suffered line up changes which destroyed the chemistry in the band (such as the firing of lead guitarist Chris Poland, who sold the band's equipment for drugs). In the midst of this, during the 1980's, Megadeth never quite found a truly stable and cohesive sound, despite putting out a fair share of good material. However, it all changed with the recruitment of guitar genius Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza at the end of the 1980's. Joining long time members Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, the band went back to the studio and produced the album 'Rust In Peace', which was unleashed to the public in 1990. This album has gone on to become perhaps Megadeth's most praised album and is recognised as a thrash classic and defining moment in metal. So does this album deserve it's place as the album which immortalised Megadeth?<br /><br />The bottom line is that there are few albums which have conistency and excellency as 'Rust In Peace'. If Dave Mustaine's aim was to better his former band, he certainly matches them here. 'Rust In Peace' is a thrash album on par with works like '...And Justice For All' and 'Master Of Puppets', as well as other great thrash albums by other bands. Hell, this is one of the all time great metal albums! With 'Rust In Peace', an album who's title is inspired by the idea of destroying nuclear warheads and laying them to rust, is an album which works on many levels. All of the songs are excellent. The songs on the album are showcases of blisteringly fast riffs, awesome supporting bass lines, crazy solos and clever song structures. The thing I like most about the songwriting on the album is it's lack of standard format - one of the great things about Megadeth is they rarely follow standard verse, chorus song patterns on this album but instead serve up a more complex, intersting but seamless mix of verses, interludes solos and occasional grand choruses. This is highlighted in masterworks tracks like 'Holy Wars...The Punishement Due' and 'Five Magics'. Furthermore, the whole band are on top form. Mustaine serves up some lightning fast and deftly executed riffs and Dave Ellefson comes up with some clever bass lines (such as on 'Poison Was The Cure' and 'Dawn Patrol'). Menza's drumming is super fast too however perhaps the greatest performances come from Marty Friedman who plays some of the most inspired and interesting solos I've ever heard, on this album. 'Rust In Peace' is full of precise, musical masterwork.<br /><br />Currently, there are two CD versions of this album. The recent release is the new remaster of the album. I've got this version and personally think it is great. The bonus tracks included are welcome additions and the overall album sound quality is crisp and fresh, with all of the instrumentation standing out very clearly. However, some long time Megadeth fans have commented on the remixing of Mustaine's vocals. I personally have no problem with them (however, I've not heard the original release) but some long time fans of the album have spotted some edits and garbles when comparing to the original. Some listeners to this album may therefore want to consider getting the old CD version.<br /><br />Megadeth's 'Rust In Peace' kicks off with fan favourite song, 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due', and what a song this is. Deservedly recognised as one of Megadeth's finest tunes, this songis awesome. Every time I hear this song, I'm left amazed by how much the band crams into the song - it's filled with loads of great riffs and solos. The song accelarates off at the start with a strong guitar assault before Mustaine's vocals, singing about the dangers of holy war begin. The song then cleverly flows into it's second half, courtesy of an acoustic interlude before more rounds of bone crunching verse. The guitar work towards the end of the song is phenominal, with a furious Mustaine solo and a climatic final verse. By now, if your listening to the album for the first time, your probably left speechless by the first song, however there is more great stuff to come. Another Megadeth fan favourite, 'Hangar 18' follows, a song about a futuristic military base. Opening with racing and heavy riffs, there are more great verses. However, it is the guitar solos which make this song truly amazing. The song exit has got not 1, not 2 but 7!! solos. It's a great sound. Another thrash staple in 'Take No Prisoners' follows; a shorter track, by no means inferior though. The song has a furious start, great call and response verse and a brilliant 'Take No Prisoners...Take No Shit' chorus at the end of the song which will rattle your speakers. One of my favourites on the album is next up, in the form of the highly underrated 'Five Magics'. David Ellefson's bass intro is awesome and is supplemented by screaming guitar work. The song has a catchy 'Give Me Alchemy...' chorus and again, like the songs before it, a mindblowing guitar exit.<br /><br />Another catchy bass intro opens up 'Poison Was The Cure', before a blistering drum bridge leads into the main part of the song, which is crazy! Marty Friedman plays some great riffs based on blues chords, at furious speeds. 'Lucretia' then follows, at the sound of an old womans cackle. This is another great thrash tune, with some pretty catchy guitar lines. Friedman and Mustaine plays more blistering solos and the end of the song. 'Tornado Of Souls' follows; another great song. The 'eye of tornado' chorus is a highlight, and the guitar work overall is first rate. The short length 'Dawn Patrol' is next. By no means filler, this is a song based on a memorable bass line from Ellefson with some intersting spoken words over the top. 'Rust In Peace...Polaris' then finishes the album on a punishing note. This is another brilliant song, a two part thrash attack, with a theme about nuclear war dominating the world. Commanding vocals and racing riffs set up a great song; the riffs cleverly change style mid-way through. Friedman plays yet another great solo at the end.<br /><br />...And there you have it; one of the greatest metal albums of all time. 'Rust In Peace' is a beast of an album and one that should definitely be not ignored. Megadeth are a pretty underrated band, often passed off as Metallica clones. The truth couldn't be further away from that opinion. Megadeth perfected their own sound with this album. 'Rust In Peace' is a rare album that combines consistency, with sheer attitude and raw power. Few metal albums succeed like this one...if you haven't got this album, make it your next CD purchace.

0375704027|5.0|I'm a prolific reader, but I'm also extremely tough.  I don't find many novels worthy of praise.  This was one of them.   <br /> <br />What struck me the most was the believability of the story.  Perhaps this was because I identified deeply with Toru, with the mixture of feelings that come from isolation and the relief of being drawn out.  I identified with Midori as well - with the sensuality that was banging inside of her, fighting to get out.   <br /> <br />I actually just finished this book, and I read it rather quickly, so I can't give a more detailed analysis at this time.  The book does have its flaws - Naoko's character was a little difficult for me to understand, perhaps because her relationships with her sister and Kizuki are not more fleshed out.  Also, people hang themselves left and right.  There is a great deal of death in this book.   <br /> <br />Despite all that, the dominant feeling in Norwegian Wood is one of hope.  This book made me hope.
B00005MKA1|5.0|A classic. This album is when Bob Marley crossed over into \\"Love Songs\\" from his prolific \\"Rebel Yell\\" style of writing and singing. The reviews of 'Kaya' were critical and angry at first due this surprising revelation. This man was and still is the epitomi of his religion and country.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Being an avid fan of At The Drive In fan as I am, I was dissapointed to hear their break up, but rejuvenated with hope with the birth of The Mars Volta.  <br /> <br />This album is so beautiful, cinemiac, dark and mysterious all while tying in their old sound with a new abandon. Fans of Dredg will know exactly what I'm talking about. It's an undescribeable feeling which leaves you thinking \\"What? Who? Why?\\" That's exactly what this album does. Televators is probably my favorite song, but all are memorable and I've heard they are something else live.
B00005JOWF|2.0|I saw this movie last night and though all the way home. What movies are being ripped off with this one? Well the explaination became clear after reading the previous reviews. The same director did Equilibrium. Well, althought this film tried hard it was not an improvement over his first film. It seems as if the studios said , hey the first movie was a sleeper hit. Lets get a bigger budget, a female action star and comic book appeal (electra, Fantastic 4, Blade) mix them all up and have ourselves a hit. Well was it entertaining ,at times, Yes. But it missed the mark on everthing else. They even stole a scene directly from an old Lone Wolf and Cub movie when they dropped the boy down the well. The boy drops his shoe she counts how long it takes to hit bottom and then she vanhishes the emeny in time to rescue the boy before he hits bottom after being dropped by the bad guy.  Well ,as we can see equilibruim was arippoff of Matrix and Orson Welles movies. This was a rippoff of Equilibruim, Blade, Electra, Matrix. THe only hope in the future would be to come up with an original Idea stick to it and make a orginial movie he could be proud of, If not call it what it is ScareyMovie1, 2, 3, 4 or Just ActionMatrix1, ActionMAtrix2.

B00008EY65|5.0|In 1944,a band of spirtually dark men and women joined forces with Hitler's quest for world domination. Girgory Rasputin, supposedly dead, helped in creating a machine and activating a portal to the dark world to unleash the seven deomns of chaos. After being foiled and dissapearing from sight, the machine did, however, let one thing through it's open mouth before being destoryed. A creature with bright red skin, a stubby tale, two little horns on it's forehead, and a right hand encrusted in stone. Along with the american soldiers professor broom took care of the infant named HELLBOY.<br /><br />Later on, we are shown that HELLBOY is grown up but barely aged twenty years. 60 years have passed and he's been riding the world of nightmare creatures ever since. That is, until, one day, Rasputin makes an appearence. But HELLBOY isn't as helpless as when he was an infant. He's got a load of new friends. John meyers, a promising second in comand agent. Elizabeth Shermen, A talented Pyro who can consume her whole body in flames and loves taking pictures. And, last but not least, Abraham Sapien, a Fish-like creature that lives to read four books at a time, eat rotten eggs and research more paranormal material.<br /><br />Together, they make a band of freak outcasts whose sole purpose is to rid the world of more people like them but who have turned to evil.<br /><br />Aside from fighting crime, Hellboy has a nagging goal to fit in. He files down his horns to 'fit in' and he also smokes big fat cigars and believes in christianity.<br /><br />But others are searching for him, waiting for him. Becuase their purpose involves hellboy. And it involves putting the demonic back into the demon.<br /><br />But, along the way, take advantage of seeing the spectacular special effects and the incredibly comic-like settings. It's easy to sympathize with hellboy because he's trying to become a man. And he has to learn it in the same way that all of us learned it . . .except for a few shady characters and unbelieveable circumstances. It truly is a Comic Book adaptation that shows you what it takes to be a man . . .even if you are from somewhere else.<br /><br />Final Verdict: He's big and red and full of wise guy.<br /><br />Enjoy!few shady characters and unbelieveable circumstances.

B000060P79|5.0|I won't try to give this band a label, because someone is sure to get annoyed, but I will say that this record is awesome.<br /><br />This might not be as deep as other things going around right now, but every teen can identify with at least one of the songs, if not all. The music is what won it for me. The music makes these songs ridiculously catchy, like Green Day, blink-182 or Good Charlotte.<br /><br />\\"I'd Do Anything\\", \\"When I'm With You\\", and \\"Addicted\\" are tragic songs of being single *sob*. Songs like \\"God Must Hate Me\\", \\"One Day\\", and \\"Grow Up\\" are essentially songs of rebellion, in which Pierre belts out individuality (come on, what teen hasn't felt like this: \\"God must hate me, he cursed me for eternity, god must hate me, maybe you should pray for me, I'm breaking down and you can't save me, I'm stuck in hell and I wanna go home.\\")<br /><br />\\"Worst Day Ever\\" and \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" are songs about being misunderstood, as the young people of the world always are. Also included here are the \\"dumping songs\\": \\"You Don't Mean Anything\\" and \\"I Won't Be There\\". (One of my friends was actually planning to run away from home and said he'd play \\"I Won't Be There\\" on repeat when he left.)<br /><br />There are some deep songs on here--at least, ones that make you think. \\"Meet You There\\" and \\"Perfect\\" are kind of sad, and if you're already feeling down these could even make you cry.<br /><br />The bonus track, \\"Christmas\\", describes the holiday attitudes of all of us, I think. We're not so selfless as we like to pretend....<br /><br />Finally, \\"My Alien\\". My favorite song, not seeming to fit in any of these categories. This song is just fun, and kind of strange but really good.<br /><br />This remains one of my favorite CDs, after nearly two years adn countless other bands. Of course, it may just be sentimental attachment considering the circumstances in which I got it....<br /><br />Obviously full of condensed immaturity, No Pads, No Helmets...

B00006JDU9|3.0|I was deeply dissappointed in Episode I because it does not even come close to the high quality of the legendary originals. There are many reasons for this, and one of the main reasons is the dumbing down of the Star Wars saga with childish elements such as the Barney-like Jar-Jar Binks which was an obvious attempt to draw in the younger crowd, thus increase gross revenue through mass-marketed merchandise, etc.<br /><br />Another reason why Episode I is a far cry from its predecessors is the extreme over-use of computer animation, which is supposed to compliment the movie and not replace the plot and character development that made the first 3 movies unforgettable. To me the puppets and costumes in the original felt far more real than any of the computer animation seen in the new movies.  The puppets made the story feel way more believable than computer animated aliens and robots. Don't get me wrong, I think digital effects can be great if used properly, but it shouldn't be the main ingredient in the recipe of movie making.<br /><br />Episode I lacked continuity and character development, which are major flaws that can't be ignored. It's a shame that Episode I was geared towards the younger generation and ignored the mature generation that the originals appealed to.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems with the movie is that it debunks the mythos surrounding the force by explaining it as some type of biological entities in the bloodstream by the name of midichlorians.  In one line delivered by Liam Neeson's character Qui-Gon Jinn, George Lucas who wrote the script single handedly destroyed the mystique that is the force, ironically a concept that he came up with originally nearly 3 decades ago.  Apparently Lucas forgot that part of what makes the original trilogy so special is that the force is an unknown, mysterious power that can be used for good or evil.  The fact that it is clouded in mystery and only a select few can tap into it is what made the concept so appealing, fostering imagination and dreams.  Lucas must have forgotten that this is Star Wars, not Star Trek, where the former is all about flights of fancy and mythology while the latter is more science oriented.<br /><br />Continuity was a major problem in Episode I, with sporadic jumps from scene to scene thereby breaking up any kind of depth to any of the characters, let alone allowing the story itself to develop.  Darth Maul in particular was perhaps the biggest disappointment since he had so much potential to be the next Darth Vader, or at least a villain close to Vader's status.  No such luck, he was as two-dimensional as they come, with no presence, no dialogue and barely any screen presence except the very end, and he dies before we have any idea of what his story was, or what kind of a character he was besides being \\"evil\\".  Even Qui-Gon Jinn was a let down, despite the fact that he was a very interesting character.  It's a paradox because the audience is given just a tiny bit of information about him, enough for people to like him, but no exposition to further his characteristics, it was minimal at best, so we are left with another intriguing character with a great deal of potential who was killed before we got a chance to really know him.<br /><br />Some scenes seemed to be superfluous such as the underwater part where Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan, and Jar-Jar Binks are inside a submarine vehicle, and they end up getting chased by a huge fish, which is swallowed by a bigger fish, and that fish is swallowed by an even bigger fish.  At that point I was convinced that Lucas had run out of good ideas for this film.<br /><br />The dialogue was wooden at best, with hardly any chemistry between any of the characters, except for Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan.  Lucas seriously should have left the script writing up to far more talented screen writers.<br /><br />The excessive use of CGI has become Lucas' crutch, mistakenly believing that it can replace a solid story, deep characters and real sets.  It would have been so much better had Lucas used less computer animation and more props, costumes, puppets and animatronics, all of which have evolved a great deal in the past 3 decades and could have been put to much better use.  Less CGI please and more story, Lucas.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, the movie is interesting because it explains Anakin's origins, and some of the space battles as well as the Jedi lightsaber duels are truly impressive which redeem this film from being below average., deep characters and real sets.

I wanted to read any previous novels, in case, Ghost Brigades built on earlier works.  I'm very glad I read this book.  It is a love story at its heart.  However, there is hard science fiction here that I feel lucky to discover once a year!  The story telling is effortless and as a result I was finished reading in 2 days!  The author transported me to his destinations with my emotions intact.  I will not soon forget this book.  The genetically tinkered-with soldier genre is alive and well here.

But this is also what happens when a rich artist gets fat, old, and content - a pleasant, mellow, inconsequential album lacking vitality or the inspiration to run its 52 minutes.      But we could all expect that from Gilmour. The problem with the fractalization of Pink Floyd, the most innovative and influential mainstream band the world ever knew, was that the sum was greater than the parts and now the parts just suffer for the imbalance and inability to create as the whole did.  Syd went loony-tunes and his solo stuff was appropriately interesting, unique and tripped out.  Roger was always the critical curmudgeon - the real soul and wit who had something to say and held the keys to the vision.  Gilmour was the spirit and the sound but was always content taking the listener to outer space dreamland. So that's what we get now - Roger gives us meaning but remains too earthbound with the sound while David gives us the meaningless sound and ambience with his head in the clouds.  Too much salt vs. too much sugar.     \\"Though the earth is dying his head is in the stars...out of touch he'll live in wonder\\" - from track 9, sounds like Roger criticizing David    This moodpiece depends on one's state of mind to be appreciated.  If you want to relax and float away, then you'll agree with all the glowing reviews.  If you want some meat and gristle on your music, then you'll give up before the halfway point.  It's all very beautiful or all incredibly boring, depending on you.      Castellorizon: whatever intro  On An Island: breathtaking  The Blue: beautiful, with gorgeous soloing and ridiculously godawful lyrics  Take A Breath: solid uptempo  Red Sky At Night: classic Floyd interlude   This Heaven: moderately enjoyable, lightweight bluesy jangle   Then I Close My Eyes: aptly named, this is just fluff, or beautiful depending   Smile: sickeningly sweet, or beautiful depending  A Pocketful Of Stones: to quote the poet, \\"There's no there there.\\"  Where We Start: wistful closer    Gilmour shouldn't be criticized for being happy and being who he is.  But this is still mostly mediocre imo. Happiness and contentment are not the greatest catalysts for art. Listen to Donald Fagen's new one for a lesson in growing old not gracefully into Alzheimerland but growing old vitally and relevantly, with juices flowing freely, no wasted notes, no meandering. That one sounds necessary. This one does not.  Burn, borrow, or steal, but don't buy.        [the more i listen the more it has become a 3-star}
B000E5N62U|4.0|First off I doubt anyone was highly anticipating this album...so right there it can only get better. I been a long fan of steely dan and fagen's solo work. I still had no clue that this was out til I was strolling through Target last week I didnt know that he was mainstream now...its usually the backselfs of my local vinyl shop to find them. now that thats out of the way. the album can be summed up in one word idealy. FAGEN.if you listen to the album looking for the next \\" Reelin in the Years\\" or whatever your given interpretation of the most recognizable Dan/Fagen title....your prob gonna be disapointed. on that note. real fans of Fagen and Dans later stuff will be able to listen to the album start to finish. I say later Dan stuff because it seems now they have reverted to much more happy \\" floaty\\" melodies as opposed to say earlier albums like \\" Aja\\" or \\" Gaucho\\". Another good point is...this is a Fagen album not Steely Dan. It doesnt stray to far from \\"Nightfly\\" and you could easily find yourself humming some of the songs just like you did then. Stand out Tracks to me would be \\" What I Do\\" a dazed meeting Fagen has with the ghost of Ray Charles. I also liked the title track and \\" Security Joan\\" I think the most missed part of this cd for me is the slight undertoans in so much of Dan and Fagens releases. Your not gonna find yourself giggling with the drug slang of Steely Dans yester years...which is understandable considering they are pushing 60. overall I think this could easily please any half hearted Dan of Fagen fan....but in the same sense if your new you would be better picking up \\"Kamirkiad\\" for Fagen or \\" Aja\\" for the Dan wanna-bees...those being the most pop focused at the time.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|At first I was impressed by 'The Matrix Reloaded', by the sheer visual quality, but the story left much to be desired, as in the story felt quite weak compared to the first. This movie felt more as a showcase for special effects than a worthy sequel, way too 2-dimensional in retrospect, not enough character development.  The new characters introduced adding nothing worthwhile, such as Niobe, Link, Ice, Ballard, Seraph, Persephone, and Merovingian.  After the movie, how much do we know about each character?  Next to nothing, so it doesn't really further the plot line that much, hence they are little more than window dressing.  The Wachowski brothers became overly ambitious with this project and simply tried to do too much with too little time.  In the original there were a few characters but at least there was enough time devoted to fleshing out their personas so we grew to know and care about them, whereas in this sequel the characters that we enjoyed from the first one they take a backseat to new, inconsequential and pointless characters that have as much depth as cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />Several plot elements seemed superfluous, like Persephone and the Marovingian.  Along with Seraph, it became obvious that these characters were simply added to increase the amount of mythological, religious and philosophical references, and once enough of them were added the idea seemed to be that a story would develop as a result.  Unfortunately the only thing it all added up to was an incohesive, sporadic storyline interweaved with several superb action sequences, but that does not make a classic like the first one.<br /><br />Its predecessor 'The Matrix' is a classic because it combined a variety of influences from anime, movies, comics, philosophy and religion and created its own mythology while the sequel attempted to throw in way too many historical references and thereby hoping to make the story even more fantastic, but it simply ended up diluting the greatness of the original film.  'Reloaded' was too busy with too many themes with the thought that more is better, but as the first film proved less is more within the context.<br /><br />The difference between the original and this sequel is that the first one made its money and cult following based on word of mouth, because of the quality of the elements involved. This sequel on the other hand has made far more money, but that is based on an even bigger budget and massive ad-campaigns that put recent Star Wars film ads to shame, and hype rather than substance.<br /><br />'The Matrix Reloaded' is not a bad film, although it's not great either. I did enjoy it, but it's just not up to par with the first.  The Wachowski brothers would have been better off with their artistic integrity intact had they just stuck with the original and never made any sequels.  Few people know that the sequels were only made based on the tremendous success of the first film, there was never a whole trilogy planned.  The studios as well as the Wachowskis saw the opportunity to milk the cash cow, and it shows.<br /><br />This film works as a good action film, but it pales in comparison to the philosophy and handling of the religious subtext seen in the original 'Matrix'.the original film.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|Excellent! This a sweet movie that each of our grandchildren (ages 5-10) love to watch when they come to visit.  They love the music, characters & fun storyline.  And it really helps them to focus on & appreciate the importance of family being together.
B00000IAU3|4.0|So let me get this straight.  Girl wakes up hung over on a dismal rainy day, misses the bus and is late for work (a job she can't stand and risks losing), but then she gets a phone call from her BF and discovers \\"it's not so bad,\\" in fact, \\"it's the best day of [her] life.\\"  Ah, youth--when love is all!  You think today is good, Dido baby, just wait til the weekend!!!  You'll be in heaven, even if you are no angel.    OK, so it's a slight song in many ways.  But like most of the tracks on NO ANGEL, \\"Thank You\\" ultimately wins you over with its matter-of-fact romanticism.  There's a dreamy, languid quality to \\"Thank You,\\" the album's US hit single, that makes you think, \\"Yeah, if I were her boss, I probably WOULD fire her, but if it got her into the music biz all the sooner, I'd be doing her (and the world at large) a favor.    I actually had not really heard much of Dido's (& Co.'s)work until recently.  But I had enjoyed \\"Thank You,\\" thank you very much.  And when I recently saw a posting on a fansite dedicated to the late great Laura Nyro, referring to Dido as some kind of poseur (poseuse?), I had to wonder if this wasn't yet another case of putting one artist down in order to build another one up.  Few singer songwriters will ever achieve the brilliance of Laura Nyro at her best: she was an absolute genius.  I don't think Dido is quite on that level, at least not yet, but in her cool, ethereal way she does offer a unique take on some of the same themes of love, loss and loneliness that Nyro addressed almost 40 years ago now.  The cool, ethereal, sometimes detached Dido may seem lightyears away from the fiery, passionate Nyro circa ELI & THE 13TH CONFESSION.  But strip away all the electronica and you have the same kind of intense confessionalism that writers like Nyro and Joni Mitchell introduced audiences to in the late 60s and early 70s.    Some will find Dido's brand of confessional songwriting a little solipsistic.  The first track has her desperately yearningfor a lost love, the second, on the other hand, has her feeling confined and stifled in a love relationship. And so it goes, from the obsessive to the oppressive.  But that's called--at least in some circles--being in your 20s (which she still was at the time this album was cut).  It's a forgiveable human flaw, and not an unacceptable one in a songwriter just starting out, provided she offers the occasional leavening touch. (One should also keep in mind that the narrator of any given song may not always be identical with the songwriter: she may be adopting a persona here and there).  But too many songs in the first person, can get to be a little much, I admit.  So much so that the listener is grateful for a song like \\"Isobel,\\" a sad tune presumably about a friend's painful decision to abort.    Aside from that brief excursion into the third person (well, actually, it's in the second person but it FEELS like third), however, the \\"leavening touch\\" most often employed here is Dido's attention to detail on \\"Thank You\\" and elswhere.  On the single, for instance, the details give the song a sense of place and an emotional authenticity that belies the coolness of the arrangements.  It's more prose than poetry, but it's striking prose.    And speaking of the arrangements, well, listening to this record, I kept thinking, \\"So this must be this 'trip hop' I keep hearing about.\\"   Well, there are plenty of beats in the overall dreamy mix, but the musical settings the singer has come up with in collaboration with her brother Rollo and other collaborators ultimately seem more \\"trippy\\" than \\"hoppy.\\"  Which makes for a perfect late night listening experience.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and decided to buy the sound track
B000096IB6|4.0|I have to say that I am not familiar with any Daredevil comics, games or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not \\"know\\" Daredevil prior to the film I have to say that the movie was pretty good. <br />Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner (who is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.  On the negative side, Colin Farrell as an Irish (???) raving lunatic of a villain was ridiculous to say the least, and takes away from the overall enjoyment of the movie!  <br />In short, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the music are all very good.   <br />Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
B0007M22TI|5.0|Stunningly beautiful arrangements of old classics and new songs; the voices are heavenly and the photography is beautiful. Each time I watch it I am captivated from start to finish. I only regret that I did not buy this sooner...
1567184855|5.0|This book offers one of the most convincing arguments for reincarnation I have ever read.  It left me with wonderful feelings of relief and joy because of the possibility that my soul may go on in time and life is not limited to a one-time journey on earth.  Even more important, everything positive I have ever been taught about spiritual matters is underscored while the negative is unsupported.  All of the author's conclusions are illustrated by actual quotes from people interviewed under a special kind of hypnosis for this research. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reincarnation, and anyone else who is open to new concepts about life and death.

0757302661|5.0|It is now three days since I gave birth to my first baby, a beautiful 9lb girl. In my last few weeks of pregnancy I met a neighbor who insisted I read this book as soon as I could. She described the hypnobirthing philosophy of birth with no pain or fear and how she had used it successfully with her third child. I was skeptical that it could help me much because I had heard that first babies were more difficult to deliver than second or third babies, and I thought maybe her success was due to her previous experiences with labor. Regardless, I decided to buy the book. When it arrived a few days later I skimmed through it and attempted some of the breathing techniques. I found them very difficult because my lung capacity at 9 months pregnant was pretty low. The accompanying CD, however, was very easy to use and I got sort-of addicted to it (only the relaxation part) because it helped me get back to sleep when I woke up at 4am every morning. It taught me to relax my entire body instantly, with the idea that this could help me through contractions. It also improved my breathing technique somewhat. When labor came I was able to use my relaxation skills to work through early, active, and transition labor stages with relatively little pain and a strong sense of control over my body. I was happy and thought I would get through everything fine until the pushing stage. I had not read or practiced any hypnobirthing techniques for pushing and, unfortunately relaxation was not an option. My pushing was intensely difficult and there was most certainly pain and fear. I believe, however, that had I discovered hypnobirthing earlier and practiced all the breathing techniques, I may have had an easier time. Even though my pushing stage was hard, I didn't tear and I didn't require any medication, stiches, or other interventions. I plan to recommend hypnobirthing to all my pregnant friends early in their pregnancies, based on my strongly positive experience and will use it from the get go myself if I am ever pregnant again.

B000BYA5G4|4.0|An interesting arms story about the neccessity of evil...for at least capitalism.  Nicholas once again takes control of another character piece.  The problem is a lot of his eccentric characters feels and looks like each other.  Plus, I think he and Morgan Freeman are in some unknown competition of who can narrate the most movies.  First it was difficult to suspend disbelief about Nicholas Cage being Ukrainian--but whatever.  I was quite impressed with Eammon Walker (a dancer turned actor)-quite a commanding presence.  As for the story--it's a pretty descent story, however, hard to believe-Yuri was a one man operation.  As far as the problem with the arms dealers which this film was so eager to point out, is that there is no solution.  None.  This film was basically made to tell you to be afraid--be very afraid.  Oh, yeah...and purchase a gun.  Heaven forbids that you be the only sucker walking around who isn't armed.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|This movie was one of my favs from childhood, altho it might seem that little bit corny these days. but its supposed to be! thats what makes it so great. you cant beat Johnny Depp, and Iggy Pop. Lets not forget John Waters writting credits and direction. Basically i could be alittle bias because Johnny Depp is one of my favourite actors. But Honestly if you like musicals from the 50s and 60s, it's just amusing to watch a spoof of them, especially one done so well as this. It's just a great movie..well, if you like a musical that spoofs other musicals.
0679746048|5.0|After seeing the movie based on this book, I thoroughly regretted watching it first. While I did really enjoy the movie, the book would have been a lot better if I could have made the characters look like I thought they should have looked and not had a book starring Wynona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. While both amazing actors, they do not belong in a book. <br /> <br />Before I read this book, I never really thought how much we all are insane at times; how many of us are insane in a sane world, as Susanna Kaysen put it; but after I read the book, I realized that we are all insane in an insane world. <br /> <br />I completely related to Susanna while reading this novel and discovered that I, myself, in that same period and same circumstances, may have done some of the same things. The movie definitely did not make me feel this way; I related to the characters, yes, but I related to them much more in the book, and at a more personal level. <br /> <br />If you have watched the movie, DEFINITELY check out the book as you will love it at least twice as much, and if you have never seen the movie, please read the book first as you will have a great experience that you will remember and will be with you for a very long time. <br /> <br />There are not many books that you can learn from which don't include large amounts of fact. This book is one that is mostly opinions... opinions of the patients, the doctors, Susanna herself, the parents, the neighborhood... and society in general. Take any side; but remember: It may determine how sane you are yourself.

B000002URV|4.0|I don't agree with the Editorial review posted by Amazon.  If you like techno with a driving beat, a world flair and interesting subject matter, you'll like this album.  I've been listening to it for years, and have written many a love scene to its sensual strains.  Give Mea Culpa a listen and then decide for yourself.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This new David Gilmour album is his most personal work ever. The last one-star reviewer's review was so bad that her name generates diabetes. We know he can't write lyrics too well so his wife(who co-wrote The Division Bell lyrics) penned most of the lyrics save the title cut and This Heaven which David co-wrote and Where We Start which David wrote himself and are the best tracks on the album. So what if she wrote the lyrics. Comparing Gilmour to Bratney is like comparing tuna(Gilmour) to Goldfish(Sneers). The Gilmour period for Momentary Lapse saw David write all of the music himself and he wrote lyrics to a few of the MLoR cuts whilst he had other lyric writers. Roger Waters can't write pieces of music on his own well without Gilmour's arranging. On an Island is a must own!
B000A59PMO|5.0|This Season 1 DVD set is outstanding.  The show is smartly written, well-acted by Kristen Bell and company, and keeps the viewer engaged with inventive story lines and likable characters.  Veronica Mars is kind of like Nancy Drew meets The OC.  A must for any TV show on DVD collector.  I'm addicted after finishing Season 1, and I can't wait for Season 2 to be released on disc too.
B000002UAU|5.0|This review is a collaboration with my daughter Christina, who has become a real Beatles fan.  Not a bad song on the album.  Definitely reveals a psychodelic influence.  Favorite songs are \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\".  A \\"Day in the life\\" is a fascinating song, especially the mood and ending.  Makes you wonder what was going on in their lifes at this time, since many of the songs are unique and dream like.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I always was interested in the story of Titanic.  This Collector's Edition really helped explain the way they made the movie, how Mr. Bodine was a real person who studies Titanic under the water and not even an actor.  There were a lot of very intersting things that they did to make this movie!  I could probably watch it and say every word in the movie I've watched it so many times.....in the theater, it was like being on the ship.  GREAT story, GREAT behind the scenes and commentaries!  Kudos!!

B000B9EY2U|4.0|The 11th studio album from Depeche Mode is a breeze of fresh air. After the digital Exciter, Playing the angel is completely the opposite. The use of analog synths brought the band new ideas about the songs. Producer, Ben Hillier (Doves, Blur, Elbow, etc) was not a big fan of DM. This element was a key for the recording of the album. He didn't have preconceptions about the previous records or how the songs should sound. He worked really fast and after a couple of weeks according to the band, they noticed the direction of the songs. Depeche Mode don't work like most of the bands. When they get together to make an album they have very complete ideas songwise. Playing the angel is the first record in  Depeche Mode history which contains 3 songs penned by singer Dave Gahan (Suffer well, Nothing's impossible and I want it all). Gahan always said that he felt like an impostor always singing Gore's songs, this time after his first solo record Paper Monsters he had the chance to contribute with his own songs, and the songs aren't bad at all, in fact \\"Suffer well\\" is the 3rd single extracted from PTA. The album starts with  <br />\\"A pain that I'm used to\\", the most difficult song to record, the feeling of the song is similar to the beginning of \\"I feel you\\" from Songs of faith and devotion, a sound very strange like the sirens of \\"Death of night\\" from Exciter, but the song is very powerful and it's the 2nd single. <br />\\"John the revelator\\" has a bluesy approach with Gahan singing at the top of his voice. Fantastic (4th single). <br />\\"Precious\\", the first single, in my opinion, is one the best songs since \\"Enjoy the silence\\". The song made it to number 4th in the UK charts and I think it would have been more popular with a better video clip. <br />Gore put his vocals on 2 tracks: \\"Macro\\" and \\"Damaged people\\" and  the title of the album is extracted from the last song \\"The darkest star\\". <br />Other strong points about the album are the b-sides. \\"Free\\" and \\"Newborn\\" are probably the best b-side since \\"Dangerous\\" or \\"Sea of sin\\". those whose have never listened to Depeche Mode it's a way to start. The sound is really powerful and contemporary. The songwriting and the production are really good and a good complement to this album would be the \\"Best of\\" scheduled to be released by the end of the year.
6305127646|4.0|I always enjoy Val Kilmer in a role like this. He seems to be enjoying the character of the Saint, changing disguises and characters. This movie is not \\"great art\\" and it is perhaps a bit thin at times but it's also a lot of fun to watch.
0380002930|4.0|Watership Down by Richard Adams is about a group of young male rabbits forced to leave their warren, and set out a journey of bravery, courage, and survival. The charismatic characters and thrilling action lead the rabbits on an interesting journey.   <br /> <br />The main character in the book is a rabbit named Hazel. When Hazel's brother, Fiver, predicts a danger at their current warren, Hazel gathers other young rabbits willing to flee to establish a new warren on their own.  On their journey, they are attacked by rats at a farm, must cross a river, and come to a warren with a false sense of security. <br /> <br />With every single obstacle, the rabbits come closer to each other and trust more what each rabbit has to say.  When the rabbits finally meet their destination, a hill called Watership Down, they feel they have found a home.   <br /> <br />The rabbits need to find does so their warren will be secure for future generations.  They have to go to another warren to get some of their does.  They face a dictator, General Woundwart, and win a battle for the does.  I believe this book is appropriate for ten year olds through adults.  The obstacles faced by Hazel and his friends represent obstacles that people face throughout their lives. <br />

B000AJJNPY|5.0|I've been extremely engrossed by \\"&Aacute;gætis Byrjun\\" and \\"( )\\" before. &Aacute;gætis Byrjun was one of the stepping stones for my entire discovery of post-rock. It was probably the most unique music I've ever heard at that point. ( ) had a great concept, was a great follow-up and a re-defined sound for the band but 2 or 3 songs on the second half were dragged on a little too long for me. But this... is a whole new level of Sigur Ros' unimaginable talent of creating out-of-this-world, or galaxy, even... sound. They have ironed out the very few flaws from before and have truly achieved nirvana here.<br /><br />The first song, \\"Takk...\\" is a simple, two-minute angelic, ambient intro.<br /><br />Next is \\"Glosoli,\\" a rather relaxing track for the majority of the duration, with light, alien-like vocals, floating bells, and a strange faint marching kind of sound for rhythm, painting a nostalgic, child-like image (maybe the video is giving me that image, but...). About two-thirds into the song, the intense buildup is foreshadowed and all of a sudden that powerful, heavier rock sound is released, creating that familiar yet refreshing transcendent sound that no other musicians can produce.<br /><br />Next is \\"Hoppipolla,\\" starting out with a simple piano melody, soon adding string instruments for a very welcoming, uniting feeling. I have no idea what he is saying but that has no bearing that this is some of the most joyful music I've ever heard, and delivers such a warm feeling despite the origin is the frigid lands of Iceland. This song is shorter and has a bit more structure than most Sigur Ros songs. \\"Meo Blodnasir\\" feels like it is the ending to the previous song; it has the exact same sounds, not sure why it is split up.<br /><br />\\"Se Lest\\" begins with some distorted electronic bleeps which slowly morphs into a delicate, nostalgic, icy melody of bells, quickly introducing that familiar, alien-like light vocal style and starts overlapping itself. Some brass instruments suddenly emerge for a little twist after a period of extreme ambience. It's a very quirky addition to an otherwise very laid-back song. However that will start paving the way for the splash of genius that is the next song...<br /><br />\\"Saeglopur\\" is probably my favorite song on the album and it seems like most agree. It begins with a delicate, somewhat cold piano melody quickly adding vocals, bells and very idiosyncratic, playful little percussion. This continues on for a minute or so, gets you used to the sound which is reminiscent of the long track before, then the piano melody suddenly backflips into something more menacing and darker, and ascends into a heavy wall of arcane sound with the wailing vocals and general melody staying the same if you listen closely. The vocals here are truly phenomenal as they soar just as far from our galaxy as the rest of the music. Just when you think the song will come crashing back down, it retains that phantasmal feeling for most of the song. After a while, the wall of arcane sound is overcome and the music gradually calms down into a limbo between the heavy side and soft side, and slowly fades out. Absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Milano\\" takes its time to emerge, introducing the next joyful melody the band has concocted. It kind of reminds me of Viðrar vel til Loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa, a melody that basically continues on for 10 minutes, but it's so good it doesn't get old. It also keeps changing from upbeat to calm, with the perfect buildups of course, but I'd say the majority of the song is quite relaxing.<br /><br />\\"Gong\\" is my second favorite song, a slightly different style than the rest. It begins with a simple string melody for about 10 seconds to point the listener in the wrong direction, and then starts to introduce the main theme. The majority of the song has a very upbeat and fractious rhythm, and more straightforward vocals expressing a darker feeling instead of such a joyful fuzzy feeling like most songs.There are so many different sounds intertwined and interweaved together here it is really a much needed change of pace and a puzzle for your ears to unravel. My only complaint is the song isn't long enough. It's so good I usually play it twice in a row.<br /><br />\\"Andvari\\" ...this song is very soothing and hypnotic... so much that the entire song just went by and I didn't write a single word during it and it was over all of a sudden. \\"Svo Hljott\\" is another very calming song. The entire song is one big crescendo, like weather going from a dull, foggy, cold morning to a sunny and warm afternoon. \\"Heys&aacute;tan\\" ends the album with a satisfied feeling... doesn't end with a bang, doesn't really fade out softly, but a happy medium.<br /><br />If you're new to Sigur Ros... I think it's obvious that the band is very much an acquired taste. I remember finding the hype of Sigur Ros on Amazon.com and listening to Svefn-g-englar a few times and absolutely hating it. A few months later &Aacute;gætis Byrjun was in my hands.

B00003CX96|5.0|Breaking Away is not only one of the best cycling flicks to come out of Hollywood, it is only one of a few ever to have cycling as a subject. The movie has something for everyone and if you are a cyclist, it is double the enjoyment. A couple of the actors are new to the game and this also makes for a truly entertaining movie. There are a couple of cycling errors but they don't detract in the least. Try it. You'll love it.

B000066F6H|3.0|I don't know why this album in particular has instigated this tirade from me but for some reason all the bad reviews have really pissed me off.  For whatever reason I'm in the habit of reading the lowest rated reviews of albums I like first.  Usually I just laugh at the ignorant fools who say stuff like, \\"The Velvet Underground is the most over rated band in history,\\" and you won't find a more vigorous Velvets defender than me.  But the handful of lousy reviews for this album, which I don't even give 4 stars myself, really made me mad. <br />First of all, I think that in 2006 it's really idiotic to dismiss a band because they sound like another band.  So the Hives are obviously derivative of the MC5, the Kinks, Da Stooges, etc. and those bands did it first and better.  Of course they did... THEY'RE THE F**KING MC5!  But you know what?  The MC5 hasn't made any new music since 1971.  So any band that worships them as much as I do is cool with me.  As long as they don't rip off riffs directly I'm ok with \\"derivative\\".  Because if you like that old-school crummy rock it's hard to come by and you should be dying for more.  Besides in this day and age it's almost impossible to NOT be derivative of something (before you jump down my throat, I know there are exceptions: Flaming Lips, Sonic Youth, Tom Waits - off the top of my head).  As long as it's done right, with the appropriate reverence/humor, it's perfectly acceptable to wear your influences on your sleeve. <br />Secondly, when people complain that a 30 minute rock album is a rip off because it's too short just tells me that those idiots have absolutely no understanding of rock-n-roll at all let alone the history of the music business.  You see, in the glory days before Compact Discs destroyed music 30 - 40 minutes was the most music you could cram on an LP without losing fidelity.  More than that and you had to either cram the grooves so close you lost sound or you had to move it on to a second LP which was prohibitively expensive.  That's part of the reason some of those first 2 lp albums are real classics, i.e. The White Album, Exile on Maine Street, Blonde On Blonde. [Actually the White Album is a bad example because it was the first album on Apple Records but you get my point.]  In order to convince the label to put out two LPs you really had to have something to say.  Otherwise your album got cut to fit the medium, therefore you left the weaker songs off the record.  The CD's 75 minute format allowed artists to become very poor self-editors.  Whatever crap they recorded got slapped on the CD.  Rarely is there a 75, or even 60 minute album that is good all the way through but, now, the music buying public, in true American-Consumer fashion, has come to demand quantity over quality.  \\"If I'm going to spend $18 on a CD I better be getting 75 minutes of music even if 45 minutes of that is pabulum I'll never listen to.\\"  (For a few years a backlash to this has been building, hence the success of iTunes.)   <br />Anyway, my long rambling point is that - More Is Rarely Better!  The Hives' 30 Minute Veni Vidi Vicious is the perfect length.  No filler.  No tedious solos that need to be skipped over.  The longest song clocks in at 3:22; no time to get bored here.  Just 12 short kick-ass examples of garage rock in almost it's purest form.  I say \\"almost\\" because, despite what some reviewers here say, this album is overproduced.  Personally, I really cherish that recorded-in-my-parent's-basement kind of feel to my crappy rock records; this album is obviously meant to be a little bit more radio friendly.  I can't fault them for that but it's just not my thing. <br />Bottom line is that this is a fun record and I think that a majority of the reviews have missed this point.  If you understand that when I call some music \\"crappy\\" I don't necessarily mean it derogatorily or if you appreciate Lenny Kaye's Nuggets Collection or if you have a collection of cherished 45s you bought at local rock shows then I trust this album will make you smile.  No, it's not as good as the MC5 or the Stooges or what ever high water marks you want set for Rock... But what is?  If you can't get over that I can only suggest your life would be much happier if you get off that pretentious pole you've got lodged in your rectum.
B00003CWTI|2.0|Film makers like this one wants to celebrate ugliness of humanity by creating movies with messed up people. Some do a decent job while movies like this do it in an untasteful way. For example, in this movie, you will hear children use the f word and cuss like ugly adults. We all know some kids do that in real life, but I do not believe children actors should cuss like that for a movie, which is simply a form of entertainment. I think film makers should use discretion while trying to show the realities of life.     All in all, if you really want to hear the f word 100 times (I think it was about 100 times), go ahead and watch and enjoy the ugliness of humanity. I really think this is an overrated film. It's one of those films that are really innovative and people like it because its idea. To me, movie has limitations in showing realities of life. Movies are for entertainment, and this one was not a good one.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I decided to pick up this CD which is my introduction to Buble. There was nothing but incredible romance, love and music with meaningful lyrics. I was so happy and pleased. My favorite is \\"Feeling Good\\" which will definitely make you feel great! I also love the modern remakes of \\"You & I\\", Can't Buy Me Love\\", and \\"How Sweet It Is\\". Overall the CD is incredible and touching.

B000AM6MKU|5.0|Since the first time I saw this film I thought it was one of the best children's movies I'd seen in a long time. Not only it enters your heart by pulling you into the world views and feelings of the characters, but it's done in a very carefully crafted way. Mr. Randy Thom reminds us in this one that great sound design must be \\"simple\\" and yet absolutely emotional. The animation and acting were pretty good. <br /> <br />In some parts it felt just a bit \\"rollercoasty\\", but as I said, it's great. Kids'll love it and will also learn some beautiful teachings from the movie.
B000028U0Y|4.0|Although Johnny Cash had performed at Folsom Prison before, this was a groundbreaking concert as it was recorded to be released as a live album.  That it became hugely successful is already known.  The Man in Black knew his audience and played songs that appealed to the population in Folsom.  I confess that I prefer the follow up album, Johnny Cash at San Quentin, to this one.  Yet the risk that Cash took in releasing a prison album to the general public needs to be acknowledged. <br /> <br />My favorite cut on this album is \\"Jackson\\".  Anytime Johnny and June sang together was a thing to behold.  I can highly recommend Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison to any Cash fan or anyone who loves good music.
0553579908|4.0|This is the second book in his \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series, which now appears to be going to run at least five thick books, since the fourth one, A Feast of Crows, recently appeared and doesn't conclude it. It keeps things going, and indeed it's a clash of kings, since no fewer than six claimants to crowns are involved: Joffrey, the nominal son of Robert, the previous king (though actually the bastard of the queen and her twin brother); Stannis and Renley, the previous king's brothers, each of whom claims the throne, Stannis by primogeniture and Renley by popularity; Daenerys, the daughter and only surviving child of the king whose throne Robert had usurped; in the north only Robb, the heir to Winterfell whose ancestors had ruled the north before Daenerys' ancestors had united the continent; and Balon, Lord of the Iron Islands and self-proclaimed king of whatever he can hold. Nothing much terribly new happens in this book, except that Stannis, through his wife, has come under the influence of a priestess of an eastern religion who also has strong magical powers. That provides a religious edge to the conflict that wasn't really present in the first book; true, some people worshipped the Seven in One, and others the Old Gods, but both faiths had a live-and-let-live attitude toward the other. But R'hllor, the Heart of Fire, claims to be the only God and wishes to end worship of any other, by force if necessary (and often as a first choice). (Something familiar there...) Otherwise-well, there's lots of military maneuvering, lots of political intrigue, and lots of pain to a lot of people, though not much to the aristocracy. POV characters are mostly the same as in the first book, although there are two new ones-Davos, a former smuggler and now a top aide to Stannis, and Theon, a former foster-ling of Lord Eddard of Winterfell and the son of Balon. However, I think both of them are dead by the end of the book-Theon for sure, and Davos probably. Even as a fast reader with a good bit of time to read one of these books takes me a good while to finish; with appendices it's over 1000 pages. Not too easy to handle, either. But good writing, good characters, and an interesting story. And I don't get the padded feeling that I do from a lot of Long novels; all the events advance the plot.h a good bit of time to read one of these books takes me a good while to finish; with appendices it's over 1000 pages.

B000002MIY|5.0|Most of the reviews here focus on the music. I well remember my first day of playing the album, more than 12 years ago now, I was focussing on the music too.  The lyrics - well, just a bit of fun weren't they - so I thought.  Then, on about the 8th play of the album that day, the meaning of the lyrics suddenly hit me and by the 12th play I was knocked out.  So for the unitiated reviewers above who find such titles as Snowbound and Tomorrow's Girls merely \\"amusing\\", here's what it's all about. Trans-Island Skyway sets the scene. The guy has just lost the girl.  He has to escape. He's in pieces and the only way out is make-believe.  But that sort of thing you can't get out your head.  He's hardly begun his magic journey in the Kamakiriad when there she is, by the side of the road. There's been an accident. She's the beautiful survivor - and in his imagination, he sees himself lying injured on the road.  He has to take her along with her on this journey through pain. 'Get in Snakehips', he says. 'Strap in tight'. We've got to make that final deadline.  We'll be deep in the Zone by crying time. Countermoon, the next song, is about tragedy.  The moon is the symbol of love and the countermoon is that which destroys love.  The street is slick with tears, a countermoonbeam  strikes and she says \\"You're not my Johnny - my Johnny was the best\\". Only the countermoon can make girls so heartless and guys so restless.  Springtime carries on the journey further into the escape of illusion.  This time it's distorting mirrors. Life has becomes absurd, a joke. You look into the mirrors and scan yourself for memories of past loves, memories which might ease the pain. But nothing does. The next track, Snowbound, is about ice - the ice inside. Put on your thermasuit. Protect yourself from the ice. We're going to trick and trash and have some fun. But then the critic tells us that this work is seducing us with light.  No way - you can't fool yourself. The ice is there.  Some (other) loser out on the frozen river fires a flare and for seven seconds its Christmas - but for only seven seconds. Tommorows Girls is about how the guys fall so easily for the girls on the grass at lunch hour - a little smile can make your day.  But watch out - they're not real girls - their tomorrow's girls.  Look out fellows - it's shredding time and it's your heart that's going to get shredded. And the truth is, all girls are Tomorrow's girls. Watch out guys - you've got no chance. Shades of Jaques Brel's 'Les Filles et les Chiens'. On the Dunes tells us how it all happened.  There they were, down on the dunes, everything seemed fine. Then, a countermoonbeam struck - it was like homicide on the dunes.  Pretty women with lovers by their side, it's like an awful dream. It's rough on the dunes. The final track on the album, Teahouse on the Tracks, is the resolution, the end of the journey, the way out of pain. You're in Flytown, as far down as you can ever get, where hope and the highway end. But it's music (what else would you expect) that is the saviour.  The Siegel Bros with Irene, Flocko and litle Amy Khan leading off the big front line.  You get a case of party feet and then the ice inside begins to crack.  Next morning you're back at the wheel, calm, crisp and strong.  The Teahouse on the Tracks was your last chance and you took it. You learnt how to dance again. So there it is. Donald Fagan - not only a musical genius but a lyrical genius as well. <br />

B00005JKES|4.0|Missed this series when it originally aired and, even though this is the `complete' first season of TWIN PEAKS, I still haven't seen the pilot episode.  Lacking those warm and fuzzy first-wave memories I'm at a bit of a loss accounting for the series' cult status.  What with its melodramatic feuds and prodigious bed-hopping this one, fifteen years on, looks an awful lot like such contemporary prime-time soaps as Dynasty, Dallas, Falcon Crest, and their ilk.  I don't intend to track down any of those titles soon, but then they don't carry the cult cachet of David Lynch's brainchild.<br /><br /> The meat of the story, of course, is the investigation of the murder of young Laura Palmer.  The local authorities and a G-man team up to solve the mystery.  Along the way they uncover, or at least the audience discovers, the sometimes seamy underbelly of an all-American small town located somewhere in the Great Northwest.<br /><br />Beyond the missing pilot episode you do get your money's worth out of this set.  Every episode contains a commentary track by a crew member - usually a director (none by Lynch, though,) sometimes a cinematographer or writer.  There's too much over-the-shoulder exposition going on to really call this one wild, wacky, bizarre, or whatever it was I was expecting.  The best episode is the third one, the only one on the set directed by Lynch, entitled `Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer.'  This is the episode that contains The Man From Another Place, a short, backward-talking man in a dream room filled with red curtains.  It's a well-known scene, very well done.  Somehow I thought the series was loaded with such bizarre scenes, but that's about it for the really weird.  Kyle MacLachlan has a good, wholesome creepy quality that befits his FBI special agent character, a pre-X-Files fed who solves the crime as much by intuition as by deduction and who really savors a good cup of coffee. The breathtakingly beautiful Sherilyn Fenn also stands out in this strong ensemble cast.  Overall an enjoyable, somewhat eccentric, series.n this strong ensemble cast.

B000059Z8J|4.0|I saw this fim as a kid many years ago and liked it a lot.  Sometimes, those childhood favorites end up being rather lame films when you watch them as adults.  This is NOT the case with Superman.  I enjoyed this film from start to finish and it brought back all of the good memories I had of it.  Each character was played almost perfectly... Lex Luthor, Lois, Ms. Tessmocher, Superman himself, etc, etc.  The solid cast really helped this movie stand out.  The music is great as well which may not seem important in a movie but I believe it is.<br /><br />The Special edition of the DVD is an excellent transfer with some very cool added scenes that I feel adds to the movie in a very positive way and helped to fill in the story.<br /><br />Of all the Super-hero movies this is the only one that really came out this well as most of them are horribly dorky.  I have watched and will continue to watch this film and of course Part II many times and will enjoy it each and every time.  It's also nice to be able to play it for newer generations as they appear to really like it too.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars then?  Well, I would have gone 4.5 if it was an option but I rarely give any movie 5 stars.  The only issue with this film is that the special effects are generally a little weak and do look pretty dated.  I understand that it as made a while ago but I feel that they could have tried a little harder with some of the special effects, especially the flying sequences.  Still, it's just nitpicking and overall it does look pretty good and is convincing enough.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy this version of the DVD with confidence, it's a great transfer with good sound and the extra footage is a nice bonus.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

B00000ILDF|1.0|I am a big fan of the first two Alien movies so like most fans I just had to see the 3rd one even though the reviews were pretty mixed.  I can now see why there were quite a few negative reviews and low-star ratings.  There was not much to like about this movie.  Here is a breakdown for you of the good and bad: <br /> <br />GOOD: <br />- Decent looking sets, dark and dreary prison establishment was well done. <br />- Seeing the real( human ) Bishop towards the end of the movie was kind of cool. <br />- An interesting premise and start to the movie.  I really thought it might go somewhere and had my hopes up after a fairly cool beginning and initial concept. <br /> <br />BAD: <br />- Killing off Hicks and Newt...BAD....very bad. <br />- CGI Alien looks absolutely awful. It was also acting like it was a half-dog (which in fact it WAS) which made it look even dumber. <br />- Over the top, Friday the 13th style violence got silly really fast, almost laughable. <br />- No characters that you liked.... I ENJOYED watching them get shredded up! <br />- One Alien killing almost the entire prison population was a little far fetched. I mean c'mon... it was hard to believe. When one of the moron prisoners let the Alien out after they conveniently trapped it I almost shut it off....how DUMB can you be?  Again, laughable. <br />- No plot, no real point. After everything Ripley had been through for goodness sakes you'd think someone would have rescued her or something or given her a break. The mean old company thing was getting old. I mean what the heck... isn't there someone on Earth that cares?  This was another hard to swallow issue.   <br />- The movie dragged at times and I was getting fidgety which means I'm bored.  I don't move much during good, captivating movies, I sit and get into them. It just seemed to be one pointless conversation after another, then a feeble attempt at killing the Alien, then a bunch of guys you could care less about get splattered. Lather, rinse, repeat... for over two hours. <br />- Is everyone in space British?  I like our British friends and all but at times you could have sworn you were watching some BBC Sci-fi movie with the massive accents. <br />- The Alien survived a hot-lead drowning which was WAY cheesey. We know from other Alien films that these critters are tough as nails but they have their limits. Not this one! <br /> <br />Overall, I would skip this movie and just let the Alien \\"Saga\\" end at the 2nd film , Aliens. This one and Resurrection are both dogs and I suggest not wasting your time.

0887307280|5.0|Like many of the books I read, this one was recommended by an acquaintance.  Actually, he didn't recommend it until AFTER he told me how'd he'd successfully built a brilliant new business and business model, and sold it within 18 months.  I was awed at the processes he'd baked into the business (which was the key reason the business was so valuable to the buyer.) <br /> <br />When I asked, \\"How'd you think to do that?\\" he said, \\"Read E'Myth.\\"  So I did.  And I get it.  I started a consulting company 8 years ago and could feel myself hitting a critical life stage where we were either going to go for it, or I was going to close shop.  This life stage - and two others - are covered in this book. <br /> <br />Bottom line: I'm recommitted to my business and have begun to think of how to work ON my business, not just IN it.  With Gerber's dog-eared, written-in-the-margin text in my bag, I'm recreating my business and am re-energized about life and work.  I can now also see why so many small businesses fail, and am pleased that mine will not be one of them.
B00005I44H|5.0|Murray Perahia was quite a young man when he started his cycle as both pianist and conductor in the Mozart concertos. He was followed by another superb Mozartean, Mitsuko Uchida, whose cycle on Philips features the same English Chamber Orchestra, so I thought it might be worthwhile to compare the two.<br /><br />Perahia:  Perahia is a thougtful, non-virtuosic, and highly musical pianist. He was at his most extroverted in these works, thereby escaping any tendency to make Mozart sound precious or dainty. Although he had never conducted a recording before, he also proved  a vigorous leader from the keyboard (not exceeding Bernstein in this dual role, but Bernstein only made a handful of concerto recordings). The orchestral accompaniments are vivacious, if a bit straightforward. Perahia saves his musical insights for the keyboard in large part, and here he excels. His interpretations are flawless, full of invention. The recorded sound, especially in early installments, can be rough, however, resulting in a somewhat shallow, bright, and brittle piano. As listed here at Amazon there is an enormous price difference (2-to-1 or more) between this 12-disc set and Uchida's 9-disc one, but at other retailers and on the used market both can be bought very cheaply.<br /><br />Uchida: From the rapturous reviews below, you would think Perahia has no rivals in this music. He does, of course, in Clifford Curzon, Clara Haskil, Rudolf Serkin (though not the late, enfeebled recordings on DG), and Uchida herself, to mention only a few. Uchida first made her mark by recording the complete Mozart sonatas. Here she is joined by a talented ocnductor, Jeffrey Tate, who may be a deciding factor for some buyers since his accompaniments are more polished and detailed than Perahia's. Philips also gives the ECO and the piano better sound,  with more warmth and depth than we hear from Perahia. As an itnerpreter, Uchida is more studied--her phrasing can be affected compared to Perahia's--but in general she is to the manner born. This is immpeccable playing, and her ability to shape a lyrical phrase bows to no one. Uchida's complete cycle sells for under $65 at Amazon and much cheaper than that on the used market.<br /><br />I found while collecting these great works that both Uchida and Perahia were completely satisfying--modern and fresh without resorting to period-performance mannerisms--and on any given day I liked one as much as the other. However, the advantage of having a good conductor and better sound is undeniably in Uchida's favor, while Perahia's more natural, extroverted style gives him an advantage. We are fortunate to have two compellling cycles at mid-price.the manner born. This is immpeccable playing, and her ability to shape a lyrical phrase bows to no one.

B0002Y69NQ|5.0|Just the sheer amount of material in this package is worth the buy, not even including the bust of Neo or the amazing packaging. <br /> <br />All the Matrix movies, extras on every Matrix movie, and my favourite: The Animatrix just to name a few is included in this package. Two doors swing open to retreive what you're looking for showcasing the slide out trays holding the DVD's nicely labelled with white text on the doors. <br /> <br />Amazing job, and a great price. A must buy for any Matrix fan that wants it all!
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|Do you ever purchase a CD based on one song you like off the radio and are completely disappointed?  Have no fear with this CD.  James Blunt has truly out done himself with \\"Back to Bedlam\\".  Every song on this CD has depth, meaning, beautiful vocals and musical stylings to meet all of your muscial needs.  This CD has not left it's player since I have purchased it.  I know you too will be truly inspired and blessed with this purchase.
B000ASATWQ|3.0|The title track is by far the best.  Some other decent ones.  But I think he's overrated.
B000063UR2|5.0|Great movie!  It was interesting to see that this disc came with an alternate \\"director's cut\\" version of this movie.  One which I had never heard of or seen.  Some of the extra scenes in that version I felt should have stayed in as they made more sense as to what was happening, however, I didn't really like the theatrical music during the scenes.  I will stick with the original movie version.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I think this CD is reminiscent of Dark Side of the Moon. Gilmour's voice is dreamy and soft, but in this way you can really hear what a good voice he has. There does not seem to be that almost violent passionate voice present in Delicate Sound of Thunder and Momentary Lapse of Reason and in parts of The Wall. I think it also has a mix of The Division Bell. However there is a quiet passion present in these wonderful lyrics and music. It is a comfortable place, listening to this album, something wonderful to sleep to and have wonderful dreams. As Gilmour himself said: He is showing \\"emotional honesty\\" in this album.
B000088E6D|5.0|Breath of fresh air, I can`t believe this young man, his music is great
0060853964|5.0|this is my absolute favorite book ever!  i have not been able to really get into either author separately, but together they are unbeatable!  i have heard comparisons to christopher moore- and i don't disagree, BUT- this book resonates in a way that no other has.  if you like to laugh, this is a must read!  why won't they make an audio version so i can listen in my car?
B000E5N62U|5.0|Once again, like he has done with every Steely Dan album and his other two solo albums, Donald Fagen has released another superb masterpiece. Hopefully he has another trilogy of solo albums to release and more Steely Dan projects to come. Every song on Morph the Cat has it's usual funky and jazzy beat. Do yourself and your CD player a favor and get this CD ASAP. A. Battaglia
0743424425|5.0|This novel-one of many reader's favorites-was a good novel, it wasn't my favorite Stephen King novel, but still the story is good. I enjoyed the movie years ago, but the book tends to be better, and this novel definitely was.  It's a story of a man-and his wife and child-he decides to become the caretaker of a gigantic hotel in Colorado during the winter months when nobody can go to or from the hotel. What happens from then on is pure horror!!!  A MUST READ FOR ANY STEPHEN KING OR HORROR FAN!
B00005JNNZ|5.0|The movie Coach Carter is a powerful but yet emotional movie, it is also heart wrenching and inspirational. There are so many aspects that are enjoyable, exciting and meaningful. I felt that the movie's storyline was very important, as it was a message and moral sent out to not only teenagers and sportspeople, but I felt it was sending out a message to adults as well. I also felt that the music used was very upbeat and new age and well suited to the movie. Personally I though that it was one of the greatest movie's I have ever seen and I enjoyed just about everything in this movie. <br /> <br />Coach Carter is based on a true story. A heart warming story about a coach who cared and dared to make a difference in the lives of kids that had little or no future; he basically gave them a chance for a better life. It is about an ex-student at Richmond high school, Ken Carter, who offers to coach the school's basket ball team in hope of turning it around. He is trying to improve the player's games as well as their lives. Throughout the movie the team faces many ups and downs, learns many lessons and also realises the importance of everything Coach Ken Carter teaches them. One of the biggest things the team gains is working together as a team and having team spirit. In the end the team never gives up and realises that they have made their lives so much better. They also achieved something that is much more than winning.    <br /> <br />The message in this movie mainly aimed towards teenagers. It emphasises that education is the first step on the path to a great sports star or athlete and that it is possible for students who are raised in the poor neighbourhoods to escape from that type of lifestyle. It is also a message of the importance of education and that school should always come first before sports. The general moral is that you have to put effort in to achieve and to grow an understanding of what students or anyone are really capable of. It is a positive message andincludes good intentions.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|The music in the film fits each scene beautifully.  It's definitely mood music with cello and violin calling...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon went beyond contemporary standards when he wrote and directed this masterpiece of science fiction.  Each character is full of depth and life and there is not a single shot wasted on anything unnecessary.  This makes the movie, not only powerful, but also interesting from the very first moment.  The power is of course dimmed by not watching it in a theatre, but the beauty is still preserved is this widescreen edition.  I recommend watching it, eventually, with the director commentary.  It brings another dimension to the production.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|When I first saw STAR TREK V in the theatre I was very disappointed.  Having loved all of the previous films in the series I felt this entry just didn't hold up to the others (even to STAR TREK the motion picture!)  I never had a desire to view the film again until recently when I purchased the special edition dvd because it had gone on sale for a very low price.  Wow!  What a difference 17 years can make!  I loved it!  Yes, the commentary by William Shatner and his daughter helped me understand the stress and pressure they were under just to make the film.  The budget cuts, the studio suggesting dialogue cuts and inserts, the time constraints and Shatner's original vision not coming to life all contribute to a film that when first viewed are obvious problems.  But, upon 2nd viewing the film has taken on a more topical and ironic parallel with what's happening in our world today.  I was mesmerized by the whole story and situation in which the characters found themselves.  The dialogue between the principles was humorous and was some of the best in the series.   <br /> <br />Budget was cut for the special effects, but they weren't awful as so many reviewers have stated.  They just didn't look like they used the current techniques that were available to special effect films at that time.  They looked more like they used a process used in the 50's and 60's.  <br /> <br />  The film as a whole works on many levels.  Flawed?  Yes.  As bad as they say?  No!  I found it funny, charming, exciting, topical, profound, moving and satisfying.  Give it one more chance.  I'm glad I did!

B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I personally thought this was a great cd! I really like punk rock music so I enjoyed this cd... especially because the lead singer is a girl which I think is quite rare! The last band I really enjoyed with a lead girl singer was No Doubt, so I was happy to hear this. Hope their concert is good.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Flashdance with Jennifer Beals is such a 80's icon movie and not only that but it has a amazing soundtrack to follow.... Alex played by Jennifer is a trying to start a career as a dancer,but has no experience from any dance school. So she wants to impress a bunch of dance people to let her in their school.... The movie has great scencic views and has great songs from a amazing soundtrack.... Jennifer Lopez's song \\" I'm Glad\\" has a Flashdance theme so if you ever get the chance check out that video.... If you love your 80 movies then rent this one tonight!!!!!!!!!
B00097A5I6|1.0|why buy this album when you can go out and buy/ download such classics as Beggars Banquet, White Album, Waterloo sunset etc. Boys, nice try but after 6 albums and god knows how many millions of dollars please pack it in. The original versions were all to exciting to listen to have you bastardize such great songs as Street Fighting Man!  <br /> <br />The act is over done, enough is enough. At least Arctic Monkeys have the \\"U-Know-What's\\" to write intelligently, with a sense of humour, and without that Whiney voice.  <br /> <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|If you read the reviews of the package they are all deservedly praising of this collection.  I could add my voice to the crowd but I will only say this:  get this if you love the movies and music already.  It is well worth the high cost in my opinion.   I strongly suggest you log into [...] to download the companion Annotated Score.  It is a beautiful track by track guide to the CD and free.  I am so looking forward to the same packages for The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  I hope they will be out soon; if anyone has release information please share it with us all.

B000BISBDY|5.0|I admit, I wasn't a Johnny Cash fan until I saw Walk The Line. I grew up hearing his music but never stopped to listen to it. The movie was great and something about his story has struck a chord with me and I'm quickly falling into his music and becoming lost in it. The Legend of Johnny Cash is the first CD I have bought of the singer/song writer's and it contains a fairly decent sample of his music. My favorites on this CD are: <br /> <br />1.Cry!Cry!Cry! <br />2.Folsom Prison Blues <br />3.Walk The Line <br />4.Jackson <br />5.Highwayman <br />6.Hurt <br /> <br />Hurt is probably my favorite off the album. What he did to this song is absolutely beautiful. I can't stop listening to it. \\"Wow\\", is all I can say. Love it.

Natalie Portman (Golden Globe Winner for Best Supporting Actress in \\"Closer\\" (2004) is great as Evey. The directing by James McTeigue (who was one of the assistant directors on \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy) is great!

0345457684|5.0|Gritty, real, extremely well crafted and entertaining. Enough hard-science for Hoyle, Heinlein, Asimov, etc. fans. Enough punk for Gibson, Stephenson, Sterling, or even Rudy Rucker fans. And writing to die for! Philip Marlowe would wilt under these pressures, but the granite is there, even with the tears.....
B000A59PMO|5.0|This was the surprise programme of last year. From the very first episode I wanted to see more of it. The writing is excellent. Individual episode story lines are strong and well worked out, while the series plot is absolutely fascinating.  Far better than the OC, too, as a portrait of that part of the world. The casting and acting are very good. One of those rare things that people of any age or gender can really enjoy.  Can't wait for series two.

Now that the movie is coming out, I got a copy really cheap and WOW! I read the book in just four days, really couldn't put it down! If you didn't, you really have to read this book! specially with the movie coming out, it's nice to be able to compare how the story will transfer to the big screen!
B0007P3582|1.0|50 cent is lyrically one of the worst MCs in rap.  He sings on just about every track to try to cover up his lack of lyrical skill.  All of his rhymes could of been thought up in about 20 seconds.  Piggy Bank is probably the worst diss track I've ever heard.  Besides Tony Yayo, who's really not a rapper at all, 50 cent is the least talented member of G-Unit (and that's saying something).  It's a shame that G-Unit is now sucking in actual talented artists like Mobb Deep.  The only good thing to come out of The Massacre is Jadakiss response to Piggy Bank (Checkmate) where he absolutely lights 50 up.  If you like mindless mainstream pop rap The Massacre is for you.
0684824906|5.0|If you love American history, have a passion for Lincoln or the Civil War, or yearn to better understand the nature of politics in this country; this is the book for you. Ms. Goodwin makes you feel you are a part of these tumultuous times and these remarkable men.  <br /> <br />I have read biographies of Lincoln before, but never quite understood his gift for people or politics until this book. When the narrative reached the point where the President was shot and his Secretary of State, William Seward, savagely attacked, I was amazed at the emotional impact this had on me, but it only illustrates how well Ms Goodwin brings these people to life.  <br /> <br />By all means, read this book and understand what real leadership is all about. <br /> <br />
B0000AMRJC|5.0|You're an idiot. Hollywood lives on. Your pagan rituals will not save you.  <br />Al Pacino should have about 4 oscars by now, that would be true now if the academy wasn't a bunch of commercialized krudd. Whether or not you don't like the violence on your first time of watching is superfluous to the view of anyone, no matter how far below the sewers their morals are; they probably can't be any more debased than someone who gives the classic, \\"Scarface,\\" one star. <br />I can't vouch for the flaws of a movie that would have been roadside fodder without DePalma and especially Pacino, but I can speak for its overall whole. Each scene has become a classic in all the history of gangsterdom, with time, and nothing less. I do suppose that people were shocked when the movie of this same name in the early thirties came out, but then again people of that time had only begun LISTENING to moving pictures as recently as five years. While a movie like Public Enemy will serve a warning about the detrimental problem that's widespread in America, this film doesn't serve such a noble purpose. Rather, this golden piece of cinema features entertainment to the highest mark. Did we forget what entertainment was? Are we so debased as a culture we see entertainment and discourage and fight it because it's not some stupid Meryl Streep movie!? <br />In summation, the opinions of one-star people reflect one-star minds. While I? While I am just sitting here laughing and shocked at my fellow society, and one of its great products, \\"Scarface.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A must for any Sci-Fi fan. The one compliant you will have with this series is that it is so short.  The effects are good (not amazing, but good), but it is the characters that make this series. They are not 100% good (or even 10% in the case of one character in particular) - but they are interesting.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|OK, I love Japanese film and Kurosawa is my favorite Japanese director, but even a newbie to film will be hooked. I loved every aspect of this film....script, cinematography, acting, score, choreography, sound, and of course - direction! This is the complete Japanese version, includes film not seen in the original US release.     Criterion has put together a great package, the quality of this DVD makes it worth the price. Crystal clear picture and sound, great packaging and graphics, awesome booklet. Included in the special features is a terrific commentary track, one of the best I've heard covering every aspect of the film, Kurosawa, Japanese history and Japanese film history.    Great story about a double filling in the shoes of Samurai Warlord Takeda Shingen. Shingen was a brilliant warrior and politican who still is very popular in Japan today. If not for his tragic early demise, he may have been the one to unify Japan as Shogun. Instead his death led to Nobunaga's rise and subsequently the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate which rule for 300 years. Japan may indeed be a very different place if it was a Takeda dynasty. It is still a mystery today way Shingen died.  Back to the film, it has pageantry, epic battles, action and drama galore, even if you hate a history lesson, the movie will hold you captive.     The only negative I could consider is its somewhat stagy, slow opening act...I loved this scene, especial since most of it was new to me (not in original U.S. release) but someone new to Japanese film might find it dull going and give up on the film before the momentum builds. You don't have to wait long, it starts building in the next scene!    A great movie, in complete form,  presented in near pristine condition by a film master in top form. This is a 5 star release at any price! For those of you complaining about the price...rent it!
B000A59PMO|3.0|although this is a well done p.i. type story line, it gets a little impossible to believe that this (16 - 17) girl can do a (mans) detective work and still show up at high school after staying up all night (by mans i mean grown up) but other than that it is entertaining and fun to try and figure how she will pull it all together (she does at the end of every eposide)
B000C65Z1G|4.0|I believe it is very hard to make a screen adaptation of a Le Carr novel which those who read the book will really appreciate. This film is a good try at a tough job. I especially liked the portrayal of Tessa, which was awarded by an Oscar.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|This is better than any greatest hits album, all the pap has been removed and this is raw, honest music, from the heart. 'Living for the City', 'Higher ground', even more telling today than they were when they were written. Time is given to jammin and letting the music unravel and speak with its own voice. Maybe you have to have kids to love 'Isnt she lovely' - I danced around the kitchen to it last night with my 7 year old and the look on her face was a sight to behold, but then again maybe you just have to embrace life, the good and the bad, to love Stevie.
0393317552|5.0|A tribute to fine writing and lucid argument, Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is to historical development from the scientific perspective of an evolutionary biologist what John Gribbin's work is to the lay understanding of cosmology.

This Diamond's near flawless and well polished, although there is a bit of surplus focus on issues Papuan, the reader will never be disappointed. A \\"must read\\" book.
8799701650|5.0|This book pulled me into the study of Latin.  I read the<br />first two pages at the author's lingua-latina website in<br />Denmark, and was lured by the way it allowed me to read a<br />purely Latin text.  It's addictive.  The Latine Disco and<br />Exercitia Latina were great additions, as was the<br />CD with MP3s of the chapters being read.<br /><br />Once in a while, the book would subtly pre-introduce<br />something.  These made sense in context but it was a little<br />unnerving to see them but not have them explained.  The<br />Latine Disco, though sufficient, is terse and could probably<br />benefit from expansion.<br /><br />I lost my routine after Chapter 16, and have yet to get<br />back.  I have since discovered the LatinStudy mailing list<br />and joined a beginning Wheelock group.  For a new student on<br />his own, the community of an online group is fantastic, and<br />the translation and real quotes in Wheelock are missing from<br />LL.  But Familia Romana is fun, and there is something<br />simply beautiful about the book.  Try the first few pages<br />and see if you don't have to read it.
0517543052|5.0|\\"Be Here Now\\" captures more truth per page with less dogma and greater clarity than many foundation religious texts. There are elements of the era within which Ram Dass wrote the book, and given his path, significant discussion regard chemically altered consciousness that may be less resonant with today's readers. I first read the book after returning from participation in the Southeast Asian conflict in 1971. In the intervening years, I have revisited the book on multiple occasions with extended family members (Christian, Buddist, Hindu), my children, and most recently this year when my eldest grandchild turned 16, and with my new fiance. The book speaks to readers on multiple levels, and resonates clearly, but differently with the passage of time. \\"Be Here Now (Be Now Here)\\" is a truly wonderful book, able to spark introspection and enlightenment in readers, and Ram Dass' enlightened gift to us all.
B000002VCO|4.0|I liked Ammonia Avenue from 1984, especially Don't Answer Me. But my favorite song on here is Prime Time, and it deserved more airplay and attention than Answer got in summer 1984.  I heard it in Conyers, Georgia during a road trip in summer '84 and loved it. Don't Answer Me is such wonderful acoustic guitar playing--sometimes the Beach Boys' 1988 Kokomo borrows from that song. I'd have to say that Ammonia was their most pop oriented album, as Alan Parsons and his band load this album with lots of pop hooks that's a far cry from their '70s progressive rock period.  It was just as strong enough to compete with Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, Tina Turner, Huey Lewis and the News and other artists that dominated the charts of '84.  The rest of the album is just as strong and musically deep.  I didn't think that they would top 1980's Eye in the Sky but they sure did with this one.  This is just as much a classic as their other albums.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" does a better job than expected of providing the \\"prequel\\" or \\"backstory\\" to the canonical Batman myth. The clever link at the end to the \\"joker\\" story is a nice touch, and the bats (as Bruce calls them, the \\"reinforcements\\") are terrific. This film always takes seriously its obligation to provide the psychological beginnings of the Batman character -- and this is not a small challenge. <br /> <br />Christian Bale handles the double focus between boy-next-door and gravel-throated, dangerous  hero better than most actors could hope to do. I adored Michael Keaton & didn't think anyone could replace him as Batman, but I'm happy with the swtich.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman provide a magnificent supporting cast, and the shots of glittering \\"Gotham City\\" and the high-tech effects -- for instance the wonderful batmobile (as one homeless person announces mid-film \\"NICE RIDE\\") -- make this movie a delight to watch. Michael Caine's humanity especially gives the film depth. Caine's (\\"Alfred's\\") affection for Bruce Wayne is indeed contagious. <br /> <br />The diversion to the Far East is a bit strange (and I'm not sure entirely necessary, especially since it does strangely contaminate Bruce). Why does every warrior need to learn his stuff on the top of a high mountain in Tibet (or the equivalent)? The first half of the film therefore drags a bit. But in the end the payoff is worth every minute.  <br /> <br />I also like the way that the romantic interest is handled here. Not as frustrating as in the Spiderman movies. At least we get a KISS, and some sense that the girl knows the score!! <br /> <br />This film shows that even a superhero deserves his Sigmund Freud. Excellent job; worth buying (or at the least renting).
B000056HE9|5.0|We watch this classic all the time. It's a timeless tale of Faith and love at Christmas!
B000AGTPUA|5.0|I saw the IMax version of Polar Express last year with my grandaughter, age 9, and we couldn't stop talking about it. Recently we viewed it on DVD and it was just as wonderful. I found the film to be like viewing the illustrations in the book on a large scale. I highly recommend the film to adult as well as child, especially if you are familiar with the original book.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|Excellent CD. For fans of BFMV you will not be dissappointed. For those looking for a new band, BFMV is the perfect one.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|Sorry to say that the new Version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory wasn't a film that I was happy I had purchased. It was \\"dark\\" and Willie was an unpleasant character. I sensed more of an undercurrent of meaness in Willie than was evident in the Willie of the earlier version. One could well understand that the children were very much the product of the weak, rude, pushy and arrogant parents. Fans of Johnny Depp certainly will like his part in this film.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This is a very action packed movie.  Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and John Travolta are great, as always.  Strong violence and sexual content.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is one of Bogie's best movies. Alot of people are turned off the the storyline, but for pure acting, there is none better. Bogie, Walter Huston and Tim Holt are truly amazing in their roles as prospectors with a greed for gold. The screenplay builds up their need for money, their trek to find it via gold mining, the joy of finding gold, the greed that overcomes them and finally, the results of that greed. This is a true classic that should not be overlooked because of the dark nature of the characters involved. Instead, it should be viewed as a masterpiece of storytelling about the dangers and truth of greed! Not many better than this one!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The Firefly series is highly under-rated and was not marketed to its fullest potential.  I am thankful to the Sci-Fi Channel for bringing it back.  I have bought the entire series pluss the full length picture Serenity.  The only way to do this film, and series justice is to bring it back to cable as another series with the same cast, and writer/producer!  Damn Good Show!!!
1878424114|5.0|Reading this book was like cleaning a window, it revealed many things about what's available to us if only we know what to look for. Some of the concepts won't be so easy to put into practice, but will obviously be well worth the effort. Just wish I'd read it years ago!
B000062X9B|5.0|My 33-year old son has enjoyed playing in a small band with friends for years. He's an avid Johnny Cash fan and was delighted to receive this CD. He owned one other of the series before receiving this title.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This is, by far, one of the greatest albums in the past year. The range of songs are broad, and every one good.  <br /> <br />\\"Last Living Souls\\" is one of the greatest uses of cowbell since Fatboy Slim's \\"Weapon Of Choice\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Kids With Guns\\" is a catchy song you can have stuck in you head for hours on end.  <br /> <br />\\"O Green World\\" was a pretty good song, nothing revolutionary. <br /> <br />\\"Dirty Harry\\", apparently a follow-up to the song \\"Clint Eastwood\\" is one of the greatest children choir/rapper collaborations ever! <br /> <br />\\"Feel Good Inc.\\" Is one of the greatest songs of 2005. It's catchy, It's got a flying windmill in the video, and they performed a crossfade with Madonna......what else is there to say? <br /> <br />\\"El Manana\\" is a slower song, but It's my personal favorite of the album. <br /> <br />\\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" is another good song. <br /> <br />\\"November Has Come\\"....it's got DangerDoom..........what else can I say <br /> <br />\\"All Alone\\" another great rap collaboration. <br /> <br />\\"White Light\\" is much different than the rest of the songs, and it's not really a song in terms of lyrics, but it's so freaking catchy. <br /> <br />\\"Dare\\" whenever I hear this I HAVE to dance, or else I go insane <br /> <br />\\"Fire Coming Out of The Monkey's Head\\" this is one of the creepiest songs I've ever heard, and I love it. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\", a short song, but I like it <br /> <br />\\"Demon Days\\" The first time I listened to this, I felt as if I was in some sort of Existensial mindwarp. <br /> <br />if you don't have this album, you have not led a full life.
0517548232|5.0|Despite having been written in the mid 20th century, this book is even more important today than when it was published. Every politician in the country should have to memorize the first chapter, as it explains the basic problems with almost every piece of legislation passed in the last 100 years.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|First off , I really loved Eli Roth's 2nd effort. The first( Cabin Fever) was a decent film, but nothing like Hostel. Aside from a lot of T&A( and very beautiful T&A I might add) the movie slowly pulled you in to the plot. We must rememeber that this film was based on actual accounts. So Eli was following the events, and not trying to add to much\\"Hollywood\\". <br /> All in all, being a fan of this genre of films, I give it 2 thumbs up.....a must see for fans of this type.
B00005JO9J|4.0|This is one of my must see shows. I enjoyed viewing the season in its entirety.  They advertised 19 unaired scenes, and I don't think that there were quite that many, so I was a little disappointed with that part.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Without a doubt, out of my soundtrack collection, The Last Samurai is the most listened to. Not only is it extremely good, but it gives you chills, envokes emotion. I am talking especially about the last few tracks. When you listen to them, you feel very, very engrossed. You are literally rooted to the stop. You stop whatever you are doing (if possible) and just listen to the beating of the drums. You listen to the choir in the foreground and you stir in you seat as the shivers seize you. There is something about the combination of beauty, elegance, and sheer power that makes you hit the repeat button over and over.<br /><br />The only compliant I have with this soundtrack is that it does have a Zimmer flare. It is very similar to the Gladiator music and the Pirates of the Carribbean soundtrack (probably because Zimmer and Badelt are good friends and all three use the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra.) In fact, all three are only distinguished by their overall tones. Samurai is Japanese, Pirates, well, pirate-ish, and Gladiator...gladiator.<br /><br />I highly recommend this soundtrack because it is my favorite over the three excellent LOTR soundtracks and is even threatening to usurp the outstanding Finding Neverland. Buy this soundtrack. Even if you aren't a fan of orchestral music, you'll enjoy this CD. It sends shivers down your spine.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This film is a prime example of how a superb cast of actors can save a mediocre screenplay. The story as another reviewer has noted is utterly nosensical in almost every way, but that is part of the charm of the film. Much of the dialouge between the characters is campy. The highlight of the film is Rita Hayworth singing \\" Put The Blame on Mame \\", This film is one of the best of the Film Noir films of the 40's and it was without a doubt the performance of Rita Hayworth's career.
0307276902|4.0|If the reader is forgiving and can get beyond the constant use of one vulgarity, this book is a guided tour through the sad world of substance abuse.  Frequent choppy descriptions help provide smaller doses of the author's plight and occasional relief can be found in the love story.
0634049011|5.0|I wish I found this liine of books 8 years ago...I would have been able to progress at a much faster rate with more understanding. I bought this book a couple weeks ago and began studying it immediatly. The method the author uses is very effective, whcih he calls draw/describe/play. using this method, he illustrates patterns that show where all the notes are, allowing for a more easier method of learning the notes  and understanding the fretboard.     if you are a beginning guitar player, get this book, it is essential
B00003CXA6|5.0|After doing a lot of research on the battle I find this film quite accurate and yet entertaining at the same time.
B00000JCOV|2.0|No solid direction in their music...it goes everywhere....the \\"wall of noise\\" approach just sucks. I do like a few of their songs though \\"Left  Behind\\" \\"Disastorpiece\\" \\"Vermilion\\" and a couple others. I wouldnt buy any of their CDs but I plan to see them live at least once when they come to PDX again
068987474X|1.0|ladies, are you serious?  You actually believe the crap this guy is talking about?  I read this book, cover to cover, and laughed out loud for the majority of it because it's \\"goal\\" is to pull the wool from over your eyes, but in fact, its putting another layer of wool over your entire face!  He singlehandedly manipulated all these women into thinking that they shouldnt be independant people, shouldnt feel equal to men, and should believe that *ohmygod* calling a guy is the most horrible thing a woman can do! <br /> <br />Please. <br /> <br />My girlfriend of over a year called me, pursued me, and wanted to be with me until I realized that we have a good thing going.  No girl should ever say that they shouldnt do something, and a man should do something.  female empowerment? ya right.
B00007E8V4|3.0|I like this band and their uniques style <br /> <br />my only gripe is that BANDS NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM POLITICS!! <br /> <br />Is there anyone here who goes to a concert to hear a political message? NO! NO ONE CARES!
0066620996|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. As a veteran of the corporate world who recently transitioned into contract work, many of the concepts in this book were very insightful and interesting. It is very fun to read and Jim Collins' enthusiasm about the topic shines through and is very contagious.

B00005JOFO|4.0|first, BM is based on the short story by Annie Proulx, I have the short story, and it's almost EXACT the same as the movie (good job Ang Lee!), for those of you who complained about the movie, complain about the short story first, the movie followed the story completely FAITHFULLY. <br />secondly, the story is set in the 60s, HELLO! when being gay is UNTHINKABLE, same with cowboys not marrying; this is answering the Gay person who posted, be glad that you are not in that period of time, and enjoy your life, 'cause if you are in Ennis and Jack's time I GUARENTEE that you WILL not have the happy life you have now, and I'm even betting that you would probably have done THE EXACT same thing. <br />Thirdly, and answering that fundamentalist who can't bear to see controversial against his religion- I'm telling ya, you and the other fundamentalists had it coming, you're the ones who bashed at people who are different from you first, so here it is, to quote Gail Caldwell \\"BM does some of the best things a story can do. It abolishes the old West cliches, excavates and honors a certain kind of elusive life, then nearly levels you with the emotional weight at its center\\" Thanks for your lesson about the myths, I suggest you should see outside the box that you fundamentalist may be many, but not the center of the world, the world is changing, GET USED TO IT, you guys had it coming LOOOOOOONG ago. <br />
B0000TB03W|4.0|I love the dvd and have her specials. I have been to both the Up and Come on Over tours.  I have all her cd's and she is a wonderful great entertainer. The only thing I wished this dvd had was some bonus features. It was Shania's return to t.v. so i expected some extra's. Like one reviewer said her managers or whoever screwed us because they know we will buy it anyway. It was a let down because people will pay for extras. Some people have said Shania's concert for Chicago seemed souless and staged but Shania is a good person w/ smarts so I dont blame her it goes along with tv entertainment. <br /> <br />She was selling for the network so why should she take all the blame? If you have seen her live in concert she is in her zone and is making sure everyone goes home happy. She has good and bad nights and on the tour for Up she commented on feeling down when she wasnt performing her best, but snapped out of it and started appreciating what fans are for. She said, \\"thats the beauty of it all fans aren't critics their special\\". <br /> <br />She has her times like all the other performers and it doesnt matter how long she breaks when Shania's back she has the material and is an amazing writer no doubt. (new album 2006!!) <br /> <br />You love her or ya don't Shania can't please everyone but she tries her best to do it. And if you want a very personal concert special stripped down to the max I suggest Shania Twain Up! Close And Personal with guest's Allison Krauss and Union Staion. An hour of 12 songs and a bonus feature with a room of 300 fans. It is my pick and this is coming from a fan. <br /> <br />I guess Shanais specials shoudnt be so perfect at times because that is her downfall because she doesnt get credited. When she does a tv special though Shania is just gonna give you the best. More bonus material is all this dvd needed. <br />
B000E1155O|5.0|Some of us here whose proclivities gravitate towards rare psych and folk have been bemoaning the recent flurry of \\"buried treasures\\" and \\"lost classics\\". It seems a day does not go by without a new release or re-issue of a forgotten or recently discovered artist rescued from obscurity passing before our attentive eyes and drooling mouths. Sometimes the \\"lost classic\\" status is not always deserved (not everything made in the sixties and seventies that didn't receive any attention is noteworthy, somethings are better off staying buried or lost), but it's sure keeping the reissue labels and revisionist musicologists busy as they map out an ever-growing expanse of the spheres of influence on music today. It's hard to keep up and also pay equal attention to all the great music that is being made right now.  <br /> <br />This makes me very happy on the one hand that amazing music continues to be discovered but it also drives me crazy us to see my paycheck quickly dwindling every week. Why just in the past month, I've seen re-issues from Bridget St. John, Kay Hoffman, John Jacob Niles, Kaleidoscope and Fairfield Parlour (all pretty amazing!) among others. And now on my plate are these previously unreleased home recordings of German underground folk singer, Sibylle Baier.  <br /> <br />I must admit when I first heard this, I suspected fraud. These recordings sound almost too contemporary to have been made in the early seventies. But after doing a little research, I found out this is no fraud. These intimate recordings fully deserve their \\"buried treasure\\" status, for whatever that's worth at this point. Baier, only previously known for a song on an early Wim Wenders film soundtrack, recorded these songs in her home from 1970-73 after a \\"spirit-renewing\\" trip through the Swiss Alps. She has the warm Sunday jam and tea voice reminiscent of Vashti Bunyan, but with the more spare guitar compositions and melancholy vocal delivery of someone like Chan Marshall. In fact, I sort ofwish the new Cat Power or Beth Orton records were this good! Like Bunyan, Baier shunned what could have been a successful career in order to raise a family and it's because of her son, Robby, that these recordings are being heard at all. But unlike Bunyan, these songs don't derive from a back to nature hippie-folk aesthetic, but rather they come from a more delicate fragility where life's beauty and despair are interwoven with the tiny details of daily life. Beautiful! Totally recommended for seventies folk enthusiasts as well as fans of contemporary singer/song-writers.
0743454537|2.0|I agree with the previous posters about the ending... which is a damned shame because I was looking forward to watching how this author would deal with the endgame of an interesting story. She really took the cowardly way out. I wish she had trusted her characters to finish up what they had started, but she didn't, and it's a shame. My disappointment will certainly prevent me from investing further time or money on any other of her books, at least for a while.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a rare achievement in film making. Where the intention of the writers, along with the vision of the director and dedication of the actors marry into a wonderful and honest piece of work.  <br />This is a story of 2 men who struggle with their identities as they find love in the least expected of places. They try to fulfill the roles they were supposed to fill in society, but when love is denied it creates tragedy for all. The story is encompassing and quite remarkable in it's depth. The film is quite breathtaking to watch with it's open ranges and wide scope,balanced with claustrophobic alleys and tight rooms. The acting is stellar, and awe inspiring. You see the characters pains struggles and doubts in their mannerisms and tears.  <br />I thought i would write this film off when i first heard about it as simple a novelty act. I am pleased to see i was absolutely wrong. This was an example of exactly what movies were always meant to be, an extraordinary story telling.  <br />Due to the material i'm sure there will be plenty of people spewing hateful reviews without having seen the film. I can only state someone secure in their own beliefs and sexuality should not be threatened by a 2 hour film. Nor should they feel the need to share their insecurity and immaturity with people who are just looking for suggestions on a good film. If you are curious about this film at all, i recommend judging for yourself. it's not a message film, it's a love story. A gut-wrenching affecting heart pounding love story. One that i think everyone should see.  <br />
B00079FUI6|5.0|I bought this DVD because I fell in love with Desperate Housewives in the first place. It is great to see how the first season unfolds before your eyes and see other stuff as well that you can not see on TV. YOu should buy this DVD if you like Sex and the City ,etc.
B000BGH22W|3.0|The score to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is commendable and it conveys the appropriate amount of emotion, but you can't compare it to John William's work on the first three movies. \\"Hedwig's Theme\\"? I'm sorry, you just cannot top that. If you're a Harry Potter collector, buy this soundtrack, but if you're looking for that beautiful theme, check the previous soundtracks.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|It's interesting how bands that have phenomenal success are so much more targeted by sniping reviews.  The Strokes are a perfect example.  I'd hazard a bet that most of the negative reviews on here were written just after hearing the CD for the first time and never gave it a chance.  <br /> <br />I admit when I first listened to this album I was a little taken aback.  It's different.  They've evolved.  BUT evolution is not necessarily a bad thing!  Upon actually listening to the music again I loved it.  In my opinion this is by far the best album out in the last few years.  It's melodic, deep, addictive and even manages to be cool.   <br /> <br />Lots of people and critics alike tend to label The Strokes, but they've always been a band that just let their music talk.  Just because critics either overrate or over-criticise a band, it doesn't mean they're not good. <br /> <br />I loved the first two albums but I think this is their best.  Get this and decide for yourself.  You won't regret it.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|Now, I consider myself a person with a healthy appetite for socially-redeeming messages, but this movie is like the Chinese water torture. You slog through scene after scene of squalor and poverty (in Africa).....contrasted with scenes of opulence and greed (at a drug company), and this movie's basic plot is the same as hundreds before it.....the greedy guys are exploiting the poor guys, and nobody except a few crusaders seem to care. There's a coverup in there, too as well as some suspected marital infidelity (guess they couldn't find a way to fit a musical number in..). Kind of like \\"All The President's Men\\" meets \\"Out of Africa\\". The really bad news is that this jumbled plot tries to hide from you until as late in the movie as possible, trying unsuccessfully to create some sense of suspense and drama, creating instead a constant stream of \\"...huh?...\\" from yourself and whoever you watch this snoozer with.  I've already given my copy away...to someone I don't like much.  Rachel Weisz saves this from only getting one star from me.... <br /> <br />Visually, it's a lush movie, and the quality of the DVD is great...aren't they all? If you like wildlife and natural scenery, \\"Sunrise Earth\\" on HDNet offers equally stunning visuals, with none of the messy plot of this flick.
B00004VVND|5.0|It was a great movie.  If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there.  I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real.  It was a movie worth buying.

B000055Y0Y|5.0|Eastwood plays a complex character filled with regret--a familiar character for Eastwood.  He was present when JFK was assasinated--as a secret service agent guarding the president.  This failure has haunted him for 30 years.<br /><br />An assassin played wonderfully by John Malkovich is threatening the current president.  The interaction between Eastwood and Malkovich is enthralling and tasty.<br /><br />This tale of longing for redemption has superb acting, suspense and resolution.  Enjoy!
B000024D4R|4.0|I heard this disc for the first time in twenty years on New Year's Eve. Had to have it again. Animals is a brilliant piece, but clearly marks the beginning of the end for Pink Floyd. What they built with Relics & Meddle & perfected with Dark Side & Wish You Were Here seemed to dimish slightly with Animals & even more so with The Wall as Waters took creative control of the band. The rest is history, (unfortunately) they couldn't \\"tear down\\" the \\"wall\\" that Roger built. <br />         <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLKB|4.0|Smallville is the story of Superman in high school.  The main story arc is the effect of kryptonite on the town--which is to warp peoples abilities and make them into monsters.  Clark Kent has to fight them and then balance is restored.  Initially I was getting a little tired of the kryptonite factor, but it became more plausible as the series developed.<br /><br />Tom Welling who plays Superman and Kristen Kreuk as Lana Lang are stunningly beautiful.  But in spite of this they are competent actors.  Michael Rosenbaum is the real treat of this series--he plays Lex Luthor as a very complex character creating sympathy for his inevitable road into evil.<br /><br />All in all a very enjoyable and addictive series--by the way--the last disc has only one episode on it and its a cliffhanger--make sure to have season two on hand to satisfy your curiosity!
B00092ZMDY|4.0|Very entertaining,beginning to end. It's an excellent example of perfection with age (& sobriety). Fantastic performance by all, especially Joe. Love the helmet cam!
B00005K9LM|5.0|This album is an amazing release by Judas Priest. It comes right after the success of Screaming For Vengence, so really Priest could have put out anything and the fans would have bought it. Thank god they put out some of their best work here. <br /> <br /> <br />I have always thought of this album as the darker of the priest catalouge. Not quite as much as Painkiller, their last release with singer Rob Halford, but it has a lot of dark themes. <br /> <br /> <br />Now, the songs are obviously some of the best, so ill break them down for you, bonus tracks too: <br /> <br />1. Freewheel Burning- This is a crowd favorite, and it has some pretty rapid-fire vocals. It could be better, but nothing really wrong here. it gets the job done of opening to album. <br /> <br />2. Jawbreaker- Now this song rocks. Great guitar. Amazing Drums. And to top it all of Rob Halfords vocals are amazing too. good song. <br /> <br />3. Rock Hard, Ride Free- anthem, all the way. this is the kind of song, that when the chorus comes on, everyone wants to sing along. good opening solo too. <br /> <br />4. The Sentinal- everyones favorite. And its not hard to see why. Rob Halford proves he is among the best singers, if not the best, in this song. The solos are amazing, i have always loved how Glenn and KK switch of soloing. good lyrics too. <br /> <br />5. Love Bites- Not the best track. It is amazing for up to a few months, but soon after you just kind of skip over this one. It is pretty cool though, deserves a few listens. <br /> <br />6. Eat Me Alive- It has a very Metal vibe to it. I think this one is a little under rated. It has some great riffs, and the solo is better than people give it credit to be. <br /> <br />7. Some Heads Are Gonna Role- Great song. not much more can be said. Great drums/guitar/vocals/bass/solo. a really good listen. probably one of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />8. Night Comes Down- Great lyrics. Very deep song, this is always the one i listen to first wheni put in this CD. One of the most underrated songs in all of priests career. <br /> <br />9. Heavy Duty- SPINAL TAP. This song is a cheesefest. but you cant help but love it, and even sing along. <br /> <br />10. Defenders of the Faith- pretty much a ton of people repeating \\"We Are Defenders Of The Faith\\" to the guitar of Heavy Duty. I am sure its much better live. <br /> <br />Bonus Tracks: <br />Turn On Your Light: I would have to say this is top 5 priest song material. Why didnt they put it on an album earlier? well, they said they dont even know. it is beautifully written. it is the Ballad that this album lacks. flows greatly with the album. <br /> <br />Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith (Live)- None of the live tracks are good. The Priest remasters have good bonus tracks except the live ones. This one is just down right awful. but its last, so easy to never listen too. <br /> <br /> <br />overall- if you are starting out in priest, this is a possibility, but i would say get Unleashed In The East, their live album, which is also their best album in my opinion. If you are a priest fan already and dont have this, then my question is \\"What the hell is wrong with you? GET IT NOW!\\" <br /> <br />thank you.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The pure tone of the voices of these women is amazing.  I heard them siging on PBS and had to buy the CD...not normally my type of music, but something about this just touch me.  These women are amazing.  I may have to break down and buy some individual CD's too.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This CD & DVD set are Excellent.  I viewed the Video with Michael Buble, on PBS TV, Great Performances.  After viewing this on PBS, I knew I wanted to purchase the CD % DVD Set, <br />for later entertainment. I usually am satisfied with seeing something once, but this was one of those exceptions.   <br />A highlight in \\"Caught in the Act\\" was a duet with Laura Pausini.  Anyway I highly recommend this, especially if you  <br />are a Frank Sinatra, or a Harry Connick fan.
034544678X|4.0|Do you think that all books written by a Ph.D. need to be dryly academic and plainly boring? Well, it tends to happen, but this is clearly not the case.    Patricia McConnell has managed to write a highly entertaining and informative book on dogs, their gestures, their favorite activities (and, no, hugging is not one of them), their social needs, and their character. She has cleverly combined her knowledge on the subject with her love for dogs in this unusual book filled with anecdotes and stories from her own experience.    This book clearly describes the main differences between our primate behavior and our dogs' instincts, the kind of differences that usually lead to frustrated owners and mischievous pets. Learning about them will help you better communicate with your dog, understand her reactions, and also prevent potential problems with your neighbors. For example, shouting does not prevent your dog from barking, it just tells your dog that you are joining her in her arousal...

Life isn't always easy or fair but the characters in this charactr filled town seem to bump their way through anyway.  Sometimes lighthearted, sometimes deep - a quircky show about quircky people.  Sad times, lighter times, they grow closer to each other - learning to understand more about each other and to accept what they can't understand.

0060899190|5.0|So simple: write your deepest secret on a post card and mail it to a complete stranger.  What's unexpected: how beautiful these cards are.  In their poetry, in their honest, in their true artistry.<br /><br />I came across this book in a bookstore and just started flipping through it.  I couldn't believe how easily I was sucked in.  I must have read half of it standing there without looking up.  Even now, I continue to dip into it from time to time and look for new ones at the PostSecret website.<br /><br />I appreciate the \\"psychological help\\" that this project has allowed Warren to give to others.  If he has helped one person through their pain by this, then he deserves all the laurels his readers have heaped on him.  But, if I can be allowed a moment of honesty, I don't really care much about that.  What I personally do care about is that he's created a truly moving piece of art that I hope continues indefinitely.
B00005JOE8|5.0|The funny thing about this movie is this..... I liked it.  Now why is this a funny thing you might ask.  Well its  funny because this movie was clearly supposed to have political undertones based around something that wasn't there in the comic.  I did read the comic, and in fact, reread it before I saw the movie.  Sure they changed a few things, but thats no big surprise.  The acting was fantastic, the script was still quite good, the cinematography was great, and overall it was a good movie.  The letter from Valerie was still just as moving, and actually moved me closer to tears than the comic ever could.  Portman was incredible in that moment too.  She made me believe she found that inch.  They changed the relationship between V and Evey a little bit, but it wasn't anything that was too surprising.  Hollywood likes to create a love story if they can.  There was a SMALL love story in the comic between them, but it was a differant kind than in the movie.  The love story did not get in the way at all though in either case.  The song playing when Evey leaves V though, that song and part just about broke my heart (I Found a Reason by Cat Power).  But Weaving stole the show.  That may have hardly been him under the mask even for all anyone knows, but his voice and his speeches were almost every bit as moving as anything V says in the comic.  Just remember, if the Valerie part doesn't move you at all, especially the part about the roses, even a small amount than you have no heart.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie that has enough of a thoughtful part to it to make you interested between the action, which is much less than I think most people will expect going in.  Give it a try, and go in with a totally open mind about it.  Read the graphic novel too, its fantastic.  Moore is a genius at the art of the graphic novel.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is the 3rd version of this movie I've purchased, and each one adds a little more to the storyline, this one is probably the best out of the 3 I have.  It definitely fills in a lot of the blanks!!!

B00005JOE8|5.0|Wonderful movie.  In a time when movies today are just superficial and crappy this movie was refreshing.  The colors, the plot line, the world that the whole movie creates makes the movie eerily real.  One should definately take time out of their schedual to go see it.  You will be very glad that you spent the 20 bucks for the tickets and the popcorn.

B00005B36H|4.0|Well, it might seem strange that I am giving a Tool album only 4 stars, being a fan and rating the first two - Undertow and Aenima - with five. You know, I used to think for quite a long time that Tool is the best band ever, but now I merely think that they are the best band in 1990's metal. They surely are brilliant and worth all the praise (combining such depth and expression with energy and sensitivity of alternative metal), but they are not gods (and the band themselves are perfectly aware of it, just read the lyrics carefully).  <br />I would like to draw some comparisons that come to my mind when speaking about Tool. Firstly, with Radiohead. Undertow and Aenima could be compared to the Bends and OK Computer, with Undertow being a straightforward, monolithic piece of art dominated by guitars and the following album, Aemina, being a true masterpiece, on a level with OK Computer, sprawling and multi-sided, touching the deepest topics that may come to a mind of a person (not that Undertow and the Bends aren't masterpieces in their own right). Radiohead's music is certainly more melodic and finds more public appeal, but metalheads would obviously prefer Tool. <br />The next band that comes to mind is Joy Division and Unknown Pleasures - Closer pair. What unites these bands most is perhaps perfect balance between the four members of each of them, then, of course, the darkness and gloom (but in the end, the music of both is cathartic, tragic and optimistic). But as we know with Joy Division,  the singer, Ian Curtis, killed himself short after recording Closer. I personally think he understod that with such an album, the band simply had nowhere else to go as it had reached the final and the best possible destination. <br />Radiohead solved that dilemma - after releasing their perfect album, OK Computer, - with detouring into arty, weird electro-tinged rock. Tool released Lateralus, which took an eternity to record, but leaves the feeling as the band, however talentedand inspired they are, is trying too hard and the result was an album somehow too complex, too mathematical and so on. <br />Not that Lateralus is bad - it is a good album, very good indeed. Tool fans and those who feel interest in deep and esoteric music will enjoy it, and I also did. There are all the elements of Tool's greatness, but stripped down (or overemphasized?): deep lyrics, great instrumentation, dynamics and tempo changes. Some tracks are great, like the Grudge, Schism, Parabola, Ticks and Leeches, also Disposition and Reflection. Others, however, may feel too long and a bit boring. <br />I am still looking forward to Tool's new album, hoping it will be more vital and interesting. Thank you for attention.
B000E8NRR6|4.0|Compared to the DVD-Audio version of Steely Dan's Everything Must Go, the visual content on this DVD-Audio is a bit underproduced. Still images are standard for DVD-Audio, but at least the stills were more informative (lyrics, etc.) on Everything Must Go.     In any case, since I don't own a surround system, the DVD-Audio of Morph The Cat interested me for the high-resolution (24 bit, 96 kHz) stereo version. Well, bummer... As with a few others DVD-Audio on the market, this one doesn't play on my Pioneer DV-563A universal player: the disc spins, but no sound. At least, there's a standard CD coming with it, so I listened to it before exchanging it for the non-DVD version.    Five stars for the music, three stars for the underproduced visuals and slightly incompatible DVD-Audio, four stars for the inclusion of a standard CD-Audio (as if they knew of the potential problems). Average: 4 stars.    By the way, the stereo hi-res version on the Everything Must Go DVD-Audio was 24 bit, 192 kHz and Morph The Cat is 24 bit, 96 kHz. This maybe can be explained by the fact that EMG was mixed on analog tape and then converted to digital while MTC was mixed digitally from what I guess to be 24/96 sessions in the digital audio workstation, Pro Tools in this case.    And don't you feel that the record companies never got their act together regarding the whole DVD-Audio/SACD thing?
1400049628|5.0|This book is the essential guide to survival while living with the undead! Thanks to this book and my prior military service, I was able to survive to write this today when my family became the undead and turned on me. Thank you Max Brooks! You saved my life!<br /><br />But in all honesty, I've read some reviews and I have to say that I believe the only humor was the fact that it was about zombies taking over Earth. Just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't. This book takes a serious approach and would indeed be essential to anyone who was not familiar with the undead or had received various offensive/defensive training. I personally think this book was a work of genious and believe it should at some point be incorporated into a movie. Too many times have I watched a zombie movie (the new \\"Dawn of the Dead\\") where the people never even said the word \\"zombies\\" and no-one ever seems to realize that a good head shot will put these things down permanetly. I think almost everyone should have a copy of this book in their homes. Not because it's \\"funny\\" or as a gag, but because the chance that something weird WILL happen, and we WILL become overrun by zombies, but because the strategies and tactics in this book can MOSTLY be translated over to what to do in case of WW III or a nuclear holocaust scenario. However, the zombies shouldn't be discounted.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|This was a fantastic effort.  The concept of hard rock tunes on the first CD with only accoustic ballads on the second was excellent.  Well worth the money and I've found myself mixing selected tunes from both CDs.  Definitely worth the money.
0300108834|5.0|We all learn little chapters of history at school, quite often not chronologically and certainly with little understanding of the timeline of our planet.  This book, old fashioned though it may be, lays out the history of the world in simple, colorful and exciting prose, relevant to children and adults alike.  Little snippets of history that I learnt in school now have a new perspective and relevance.  Mr Gombrich writes very evocatively and with great respect for human strengths and weaknesses.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I've been collecting live dvd's from many of my old favorite rock bands from the 80's and 90's, and this recent addition is probably one of the best I own. <br /> <br />The audio is stunning in terms of clarity and power, the 5:1 mix rocks, especially if you have a powerful home theater set up, the harmonies are very clear and lush and the low end is tight. <br /> <br />The performance though, is what sets this dvd apart from most, an almost perfect ride through their back catalog with a couple of tunes from \\"Arrival\\" thrown in, \\"Higher Ground\\" being one of the best performances and also one of the best songs they've ever written imo.........you can also amuse yourself by checking out the numerous dirty looks, glares and gestures Neal gives his monitor tech throughout this song and others, I'm not really sure why though because his guitar sound is unbelievable, very loud and crystal clear, if you thought his sound was a tad buried in some of the studio productions, you'll be surprised with this audio mix, he effortlessly re-creates the riffs and leads you all know so well, great stuff. <br /> <br />The other highlight of this show is Steve Augeri's vocals, like several reviewers I actually think he's a better all round singer, maybe doesn't have the high range of Perry but his delivery is markedly more powerful.......he's also a much better live singer in my estimation, puts the coked out Steve Perry performance of \\"Be Good To Yourself\\" on the greatest hits dvd to complete shame. <br /> <br />Deen Castronovo shows everybody why he is one of the most powerful drummers in rock, he hits the skins incredibly hard but with great precision and panache', his performance is exemplary, and he also adds harmony vocals to many of the songs while doing so ! <br /> <br />I would have liked to have seen a documentary or 2 added but thats a minor quibble........definetely looking forward to the new live dvd from the last tour thats supposedly coming out this summer, hopefully it'll be the whole 3 hour show. <br /> <br />All in all a must buy for Journey and indeed, all melodic rock fans out there.
1932907009|5.0|This book really grabbed me by the lapels and invited me to take an \\"out of the box\\" look at screenwriting, for which I'm very grateful. The book is about asking a simple but classic question regarding your story, \\"what's it about?\\" The author's premise is,  if you can't answer that question conscisely in one or two sentences...you've got a problem. It's a uniquely insightful \\"how to\\" on screenwriting. I found it to be very practical with numerous examples, and a down to earth look at the business of writing screenplays for movies.
0399143904|5.0|Rainbow Six is without a doubt the best novel of its kind that I have ever read: John Clark grabbed my full attention in Remorse and I'm just sorry Tom Clancy aged him so quickly. John Clark is the Rambo of Tom Clancy's best work!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Despite its flaws, the original \\"Let It Be\\" is a fine album with great songs. I won't say there is nothing worthwhile on \\"Naked\\". For one, the song order makes more sense and works better, and the following 4 tracks are great: the remixed and remastered versions of \\"Dig A Pony\\" (with some minor keyboard fills not heard on the original), \\"Two Of Us\\" (minus opening chatter), \\"I Me Mine\\" (minus strings), and a lovely psychedelic version of \\"Across The Universe\\" (also minus strings). The rest of the album is a mostly shoddy, disappointing affair. It's not revisionism, as someone said; it's a half-assed, money-making toss-off. First of all, some of the songs such as \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" sound like lethargic rehearsal outtakes, and the latter stops abruptly before the end. \\"Let It Be\\" is not that markedly altered and \\"Get Back\\" sounds exactly the same as the single version (with inferior sound quality - see below). \\"One After 909\\" is remastered from the original, but for some reason the percussion has a \\"shaky\\" sound I find disturbing. \\"For You Blue\\" is okay but definitely not an improvement on the original. And even if you don't like the excess orchestration of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", this naked version sounds lacking and incomplete. But the worst offense of this CD is that the sound quality on most of the tracks (with the exception of the four I mentioned up front and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\") is terrible, with noticeable hiss and a muddied, muffled sound. I can only assume this was intentional; they could have mixed it out, especially since \\"Get Back\\" is the same as the original single (which sounds much crisper and clearer). If this project had been promoted as a conceptual cousin to the \\"Anthology\\" series then maybe it wouldn't be such a blatant disappointment (but even the outtakes on \\"Anthology\\" from this period had decent sound quality), but implying this is the album the Beatles originally intended is totally misleading. If they had simply remixed and remastered the album and offered as bonus tracks the unorchestrated versions of \\"Across the Universe\\", \\"I Me Mine\\", and \\"Long And Winding Road\\", etc. then it would have been excellent. As for this, I'm glad I didn't spend money on it in the first place.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|If you do not compare it to the stage version. You cannot compare the two things at all, they are two complete different mean of entertainment.  <br /> <br />That said I thought the movie was very well done. The best thing was the cast, almost the entire OBC. The newcomers, Rosario and Tracie still knew the characters and all actors were true to who the characters are.  <br /> <br />The music is fun, the story is moving. The movie does have its flaws, but is overall very enjoyable. If you are a fan of Rent or like musicals in general check it out.

B00003CWPL|4.0|David Lynch`s dreams are most people`s nightmares.  I like that the filmmaker has not heard one persons take on what this is truly about yet.  I think it is about how life always manages to be both enduring and harsh no matter how good we have it at times.  Human nature is compelling and contradictory sometimes simultaneously.  The visual themes usually have a distorted way to them as if man made or manufactured.  The organic materials even seem somehow void of life which makes for very dreary watching.  I don`t quite know how to describe the experience, but, I know why you should sit through from beginning to end for this film.  It manages to make more sense when you have seen it all in one.  The cut Lynch originally had shown probably would have made less sense if that`s possible.  He went back in and trimmed the thing based on his first screenings.  Hard to place my finger on something so imagined.  The are imaginings within imaginings that can make the viewer perhaps uneasy with complexity to have an easy happy read - or a simple sad read.  There is no easy read to this riddle.  One thing I`d like to note is that I didn`t feel bad, sad, or happy for any of the characters either.  Maybe because I never really could understand anyone`s motives for their actions through-out.  One more reason to have this industrialized feeling about all of it.  Very manufactured, and \\"Lynch approved\\".  You might say if he had the stamper at the end of the conveyer belt he`d also have his inspector`s # attached...
0802130208|5.0|Personally, I am dumbfounded at some of the claims of the more, shall we say, uptight reviewers found on this page.  To hold an opinion which is contrary to most others' is, of course, perfectly fine, but to claim that those who like the book are simply following suit, that we are simply seeing the \\"emperor's new clothes\\" so as not to be thought stupid, is an affront to the intelligence of the thousands and thousands of readers who have enjoyed this book.  A few things; this is not a comedy in the way an Elmore Leonard novel, or a Douglas Adamas novel, is a comedy.  The comedy is not outright -- that is to say that this is not a novel built around jokes and one-liners -- but that the comedy comes from the characters, the dialogue and the overall outrageousness of its situations.  It is also a misconception that a great main character must be indentifiable with the reader.  The point of the novel is that Ignatius is NOT identifiable to a normal person, just as he cannot identify with normal society.  Were his convictions easy to indentify with, was his position on society easy to swallow and his speech more coloquial he would not be Ignatius J. Reilly.  He is, in fact, one of the snidest, most self-deluded characters I have ever read had the pleasure to read.  He treats his mother terribly, his medieval philosophies sound like the ramblings of an imbecile, and his excuses and complaints could, if they were realized in life, drive someone insane.  It is his good-natured intentions, though, his self-delusions that his shortcomings are in fact blessings and the sheer rediculous nature of his pompousness that makes him such a comic gem of a character.  That we who find this to be true are being compared to the peasants in the age old fable of the emperor's new clothing seems to say a wealth about those who make such claims.  Is it not enough to state one's opinion?  Must one put oneself on a literary pedestal, insulting the intelligence of anyone who disagrees with you?Because you didn't \\"get it\\" does not mean that there was nothing to \\"get.\\"  We got it.  And we who did are in agreement; those new clothes the emperor's sporting are looking damn good. <br /> <br />In summary, there is a reason this book won the Pulitzer Prize and it's not because the judges were too scared to admit they didn't like it.  It's clever, well-written, fast-paced, absorbing and absurd. <br /> <br />Oh, and it's extremely funny, as well.

B000E33VWW|3.0|This movie deserves five stars for acting and four stars for story, but I'm giving it only three stars to indicate how much I wanted to know at least a little more. This film seemed to have it both ways: On the one hand, Capote is a selfish, cynical, manipulative, \\"insincere artist\\"; on the other hand he becomes too emotionally involved with his human subjects and \\"sacrifices his soul\\" writing \\"In Cold Blood.\\" Capote never writes another book and dies of alcoholism years later. Are we supposed to assume a relationship between that book and Capote's decline? There's one line in the movie in which Capote says, \\"This book will change how I see the world, how everyone will see the world.\\" Did it? And did he mean that it would change things for worse? Is it possible that Capote's pre-existing alcoholism was more responsible for his depression and decline than the writing of the book? As I said, there are many unanswered questions and I wish a little more had been shown in this fine film.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|I so much wanted to like this movie better than I actually did.<br /><br />The lead performances are good. Oscar worthy?  I'm not sold on that.  I like Witherspoon, but thought Phoenix's performance was stronger. I found their vocal performances to be well done.  Not a forced imitation of Carter or Cash, but more of an homage.<br /><br />Maybe it was the editing - but the story didn't flow well. There wasn't a good portrayal as to why June and John were attracted to each other.  And Cash's detox program was the shortest shown in any movie or Lifetime special.  We are also to infer that some healing went on w/Johnny and his father - but considering most of the conflict in the movie is based on their relationship, I don't think it would have been too much to play that out a bit.<br /><br />The extras are barely that. Commentary and languages. The deleted scenes, as with most dvds, add nothing and were ripe for cutting from the movie in the first place.

When you add the orchestra, the songs become more powerful.  Case in point: \\"One\\".  The studio version is very good, but the S/M version blows you away, esp. the guitar solo, before the bridge.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|This movie was a box office hit but not as big as they would of liked it(it made just over $200 million) and was shut out of most of the awards. I found this film one of the best films of 2005. It's a great action adventure epic that they dont make anymore. The acting was great the story was great and the directing was great everythign about this movie was great. The special effects where excellent and looked life like. The movie is long over 3 hours and at times it drags and the ending is long when you know what will happen. Overall a must see movie event that is one of the best films to come along in a while.

1575666286|5.0|An indispensable aid for those wishing to use the highest cure rate therapy for cancer yet devised. The incredible cures for many degenerative diseases wrought by slight variations of this program are also described in this book. With the recent opening of a Gerson Therapy center in Hawaii, and with the Baja Nutri Care facility in Las Playas de Tijuana, Mexico, what's not to love about this amazing chance to survive the deadly big \\"C\\"? With a cure rate under 10% in America, why not go with the Gerson Therapy, with almost ten times the cure rate? This book is logical, orderly, and well thought out. It is not \\"easy reading,\\" but it is certainly essential reading for our day. The present rate for cancer is five of every twelve alive today. Doctors are already predicting that the rate will increase yet again. Be prepared. Know how to prevent cancer, not just cure it.<br /><br />Update 12-15-2006. My wife began the Gerson Therapy for stage 4A Malignant Melanoma in October 2005. She is quite healthy today and her cancer markers are perfectly normal according to her monthly blood work. She has at least 10 months remaining to stay on the full Gerson Therapy. She has already out-survived 7 out of 10 patients with her diagnosis from the same start date who were or are undergoing \\"conventional\\" medical treatment. Conventional treatment odds for her five year survival are 1 in 200. Gerson Therapy gives her 80 chances out of the same 200. Yes, there are other therapies out there, but it is a minefield that can kill you if you land on the wrong therapy. The Gerson Therapy has about a 75 year history of great overall success. It is definitely not 100% though. Check the history of whatever others you are looking at. But whatever you do, remember that your health decisions are in your hands alone and that your life is a precious thing. Don't let anyone scare you into wasting it.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|Emily Rose is dead, and the court of law must determine the reason. I know horror film fans would love the film, and some reviewers have found it intelligent, but here I beg to disagree. Yes, the film is not bad, but at the same time I believe somewhere deep inside `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' there is a better film that could have been. <br />  <br />The spooky opening scene effectively introduces us to the world where the supposedly possessed girl was living in a secluded house. Then you are to meet Tom Wilkinson' priest Father Moore who is charged for negligence that the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) says resulted in the death of Emily Rose. Very ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) takes up the case to defend the priest. <br /> <br />From this point, `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' starts to look like two films in one, one about the courtroom and the other about the death of Emily Rose. <br /> <br />[COURTROOM DRAMA] The film says it is based on the true events, which are in themselves intriguing and intelligent too - `People vs. Exorcist' -- but what you see in the film's two hours you saw somewhere else in other countless courtroom dramas. The film has strong acting from the strong cast, but the characters are terribly flat. Though the frequent flashbacks attempt to hide the fact, the courtroom drama itself is boring and fails to live up to our expectation that we have from the initial scenes. The ambitious female lawyer is working under the slimy guy in suit. New evidence appears and witness appears and disappears as in some other films. The judge is severe (but fair). Haven't we seen them somewhere else before? <br /> <br />[HORROR] Horror part of the film, which is mainly shown in the flashback scenes are slightly better, greatly helped by the very committed acting from Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose. She doesn't have to be Linda Blair with her rotating head, but it is easy to imagine she had to endure a lot. The film tries to give us shocks very often always with Ms. Carpenter doing something painful, like bending her body backward, scratching the wallpaper, and eating insects. And of course she has to growl like a demon. It is a cheap trick, some might say, but at least it is not boring. <br /> <br />And whatever the producers might say about the film and its `based on the truth' story, we are attracted to the scary part of the film, and `Emily Rose' is certainly scary. But intelligent debate about the religion and the law? No, even though the film obviously wants to be so.

So if you don't like this review, I'm sorry.<br /><br />Reanimation is a remix album of every song from Hybrid Theory including the songs \\"My December\\" and \\"High Voltage\\". Almost all the remixes are alike in some way. Some by techo, some by hip-hop. Some are incredible and some are an utter waste of time.<br /><br />Here are my reviews for each track.<br /><br />1.Opening<br /><br />Its just an intro so I won't review it.<br /><br />2.Pts.Of.Athrty (Points Of Authority)<br /><br />The original version was a little bit techno and almost no rock. This remix offers you about twice as much techno as the original \\"Points Of Authority\\" did. This is a very decent track, but if you have heard The Crystal Method's remix (from the LP Underground v2.0 album) you would say that this is one is probably nowhere funky enough.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />3.Enth E Nd (In The End)<br /><br />\\"In The End\\" was a great track from Hybrid Theory. But Reanimation ruins it. Its turns it into a very fast piano song, puts more hip-hop in and takes out all of the metal characteristics and excellent vocals. The chorus doesn't even bring up the song's potential. Now if you like very fast paced hip-hop songs with some piano, you should listen to this. If you're hoping for a good remix of an excellent song, don't listen.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />4.[Chali]<br /><br />Just a message so I won't review.<br /><br />5.Frgt/10 (Forgotten)<br /><br />While all the rock and metal is tooken out of this song, I find this track fairly decent. They've took out the metal and put in hip-hop, and it doesn't sound nearly as bad as \\"Enth E Nd\\". The chorus is a tad quiet and the verses aren't the best I've heard, but the song shows. The verse sung by Chali 2Na is not bad. Not bad at all. Hip-hop took over the metal here, but it did pretty good too my opinion.<br /><br />3.5/5<br /><br />6.P5hng Me A*wy (Pushing Me Away)<br /><br />This is a pretty good remix. They have done quite a lot effects on it and made it sound like an actual remix. The verses aren't much different but the chorus is. I think the original chorus and this chorus show the exact amount of feeling to give this song potential. They have done it a bit like \\"Pts.Of.Athrty\\", by putting some techno in and not changing much of the song. I wonder why this was on the \\"Live In Texas\\" album instead of Pts.Of.Athrty.?<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />7.Plc.4 Mie Haed (A Place For My Head)<br /><br />Somewhat related to \\"P5hng Me A*wy\\", it doesn't change the lyrics too much but nearly changes the genre from the metal to techno. The 2nd verse, which is the rap verse, is almost as fast as the 2nd verse of \\"Papercut\\" and the rhyming is good and timing is almost perfect. This is quite a long track also. I like the effect near the end, where Mike is quietly rapping, then Chester starts whispering \\"GO AWAY!\\" and it gets louder and leads to his excellent solo with a bit of piano. A very good remix we have here.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />8.X-ecutioner Style<br /><br />Im not going to review this.<br /><br />9.H! Vltg3 (High Voltage)<br /><br />The 1 of the 2 tracks that is remixed that is not off \\"Hybrid Theory\\". The remix that was featured on the single \\"One Step Closer\\", has effects and sonds from \\"Cure For The Itch\\". This song, however, has its own orignal beats and sounds, with a repeating piano note. The rap verse is very fast, and it's pretty decent. You probably haven't heard the original \\"High Voltage\\" or the remix on the One Step Closer single, but this song is good enough.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />10.[Riff Raff]<br /><br />Just a message. Not reviewing.<br /><br />11.Wth>You (With You)<br /><br />Ah, a remix of one of the most powerful songs from Hybrid Theory. This one is very good out of most of the other ones here. The metal and rock stays in this and rap goes along with it. Now thats what I would call a remix. It has enough scratching and repeats to be one too. The guitar notes and changed and repeated a few times but its ok. Also the near the end, Aceyalone starts to rap. His songs are good and it makes the song nearly flawless. Its hard to choose between the orignal \\"With You\\" and this one. There both excellent.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />12.Ntr/Mission<br /><br />Not reviewing this.<br /><br />13.PPr:Kut (Papercut)<br /><br />4 artists remixed this? Well, they could of done twice a better. The orignal verses and chorus is too quiet, and the rock beats are replaced with some crappy funk beat. It makes this song a bit darker then it should be. The rapping by the other artists is not bad though, and it kinda brings the song up a bit. So altogether, its not actually a horrible song, but it could of been quite better. At least its not another \\"Enth E ND\\".<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />14.Rnw@y (Runaway)<br /><br />The remix of \\"Runaway\\". Well Runaway wasn't the best song by Linkin Park but it showed. This remix does also. The techno and funk with bits of rock make this a perfect remix. But the chorus effects are a bit too loud and not perfect. I also noticed the lyrics are changed a bit. The rap verse after Mike is done saying \\"Gonna runaway...\\" over and over is as much decent as all the other songs, so that makes this remix one of the good ones on this album.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />15.My{Dsmbr (My December)<br /><br />I did not like the orignal \\"My December\\" so I listening to this and got pretty much the same feeling I did as I listened to the original. The hip hop in this doesn't bring up the feeling as much as the other remixes. I plain just don't like this remix or the original. I know it's supposed to be slow and not metal because its a Christmas song, but the remix could of made it better than it was, not just give it a crappy hip-hop feeling.<br /><br />2.5/5<br /><br />16.[Stef]<br /><br />Just a message. No review.<br /><br />17.By_Myslf (By Myself)<br /><br />The thrashing metal track, \\"By Myself\\" is remixed, and it's good.<br /><br />They give very catchy techno and funk styled beats, and its better than the metal in the original track to me. The chorus feelings is knocked down just a bit, but it's very good, while the verses have a more happy feeling than a dark one. There is no rapping in this but I think that makes it awesome. The part where Mike starts saying \\"Don't you\\" over and over is good. He's quiet, then gets louder, and then Chester starts with the screaming vocals combined with techno and funk. Just plain awesome.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />18.Kyur4 The Ich (Cure For The Itch)<br /><br />\\"Cure For The Itch\\" was just some beats and scratching by Joe. This remix gives a lot more beats, techo, scracthing, vocals and rhythm. I don't really think that it should have been remixed, but this remix is just so damn catchy! The vocals are a bit weird, some sound like little aliens. This track is pretty good overall, but not the best idea for a remix.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />19.1stp Klosr (One Step Closer)<br /><br />This track is good, but it has quite a few bad things that brings this remix down. First of all, the introduction is too long. Actually, the whole song is. Nearly 6 minutes long. Second, the chrous is only half the lyrics of the original, until the end. Im not saying this tracking bad or awful, its good. But I think those things need fixing.  Ok, while some of the metal/rock is taken out and replaced by techno/hip-hop (as usual), its not bad. And before Chester gets to hs \\"Shut up!\\" part, there's a singing part not in the song. I wouldn't call it rap, but it's good. I think its Jonathan Davis singing it, and I would probably say it its, due to his lyrics, ex. \\"Blood is pouring\\". He says \\"Blood is pouring\\" right after Chester saying \\"Shut up\\" everytime except the last time. I still love this remix and I think its nearly flawless.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />20.Krwlng (Crawling)<br /><br />Finally, I'm reviewing the last song of the album. This review has to end sometime, lol. Ok lets get started. The original \\"Crawling\\", was the most metal song from Hybrid Theory, in my opinion. But this remix totally wears the song out. It goes from metal to, no not techno or hip-hop, a crappy violin and soft genre. Even Aaron Lewis doesn't do too well with his vocals in this, he don't rap, he sings one of the chorus'. But it soons starts to speed up and it has a little catchy techno. Not a lot though. But it still doesn't bring back the feeling that \\"Crawling\\" had.<br /><br />Well, my review is over. This is my first one on Amazon, and its long. Im sorry for that. Im also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes I made. Just remember, everyone has an opinion. Im not stupid just because I don't like a certain track on there that everyone says they love. Now if you found this review helpful and thought I did a good job, please check this review as helpful.

B00005AWMF|5.0|Sometimes a \\"Best of...\\" compilation really does work and here's a perfect example. Not only does it live up to its title but it flows pretty seamlessly from start to finish capturing, on the way, some wonderful music from this underrated and increasingly forgotten artist. Sade's naturally \\"cool\\" voice weaves its way through a set of excellent, self-penned, jazz-tinged tracks featuring exquisite, perfectly \\"laid-back\\" arrangements to create a distinctive and unforgettable album that's a serious contender for one of the best late night records out there.

After finishing it I bought four extra copies to share with co-workers, friends and family. It is a very insightful book and it displays life in a new perspective.  I recommend this book to anyone who needs motivation to start a new path in their life!  Enjoy...
B000024D4R|5.0|this is my favorite of all the pink floyd albums. i dont really know for what particular reason i guess it just moves me the most. pigs is my favorite song on here but the whole album is very good and i love how each pink floyd album connects with itself throughout the whole thing, following the same plot sort of like a movie or a book. the music these guys put out is just fantastic. they can paint so many pictures in your head with their words and so many emotions in you're soul with their sound. quite a few have tried to emulate their sound but no psychadelic band will ever match the success of pink floyd. they mastered their genre, there's no doubt about that.
B000B19BCG|5.0|The music of supergrass have grown up with me. I discovered their music when I was in my teens and have stayed a fan throughout the years. I loved I Should CoCo along with everyone else and the less popular In it for the money. I loved the self-titled Supergrass as well, particularly the song \\"Moving\\". <br /> <br />Road to Rouen has re-ignited my passion for their music. \\"St Petersburg\\" is one of my favorite songs at the moment... <br /> <br />I feel Supergrass have stayed true to themselves and in a way, had chosen to shun the super stardom some bands had arrived at only to lose themselves (Coldplay, though I still like them). The genuine love they have for their music and the obvious fun they have in making it is evident in every album.... <br />The best part is, they don't take themselves too seriously and therein lies the charm of Supergrass.
B000E33VWW|5.0|With \\"In Cold Blood\\", Truman Capote became America's most famous writer.  This movie shows that Capote sold his soul in order to produce the book. <br /> <br />The book is about the cold blooded murders of a family in Kansas. Capote befriended Perry Smith, one of the killers.  He got Smith to confide in him at first by getting him an appellate lawyer who gave Smith some temporary relief through the appellate process. <br /> <br />As Smith faced the death penalty and exhausted his appeals, the movie suggests that Capote deliberately refused to help Smith out beyond that first effort. It leaves the viewer wondering whether he may have had the chance to do so. If the movie accurately portrays Capote, it was Capote's realization that he cared more about his book than about his \\"friend\\" that tore his mind apart. <br /> <br />As Capote himself said: \\"answered prayers cause more tears than those that remain unanswered\\".  <br /> <br />In the end, Capote got what he prayed for, but he also never wrote another book. The movie suggests he asked himself the question: \\"If I hadn't been so selfish, could I have saved Smith's life?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only became aware of the Firefly series after seeing Serenity on the big screen... as a huge Buffy fan, I got the DVD set immediately was so enthralled that I only wish there were more episodes! The characters are interesting and funny and of course the Whedon-esque dialoge is never dull. I'm not really a huge sci-fi fan but I found the futuristic premise of Firefly to be really fascinating. The biggest surprise was that my husband (a big sci-fi fan who can't stand Buffy) loved Firefly as much as me! (well, nearly).
B0006284JQ|1.0|Blue Racer: Say bug, I don't know what is up with this airheaded evil temptress who makes me look like Einstein in comparison. Japanese Beetle: This tramp who calls herself Britney Spears is now a laughing stock of music. Blue Racer: So what if this airbrushed redneck harlot had 5 Platinum albums in the US(her sixth FLOPPED)(laughs), one number one single which was her first single and hasn't been able to match since. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, she also won a technical Grammy(if it is not Album of the Year or one of the major awards then we don't care, she lost Best New Artist to Christina Aguilera) and has a freeloading deadbeat of a husband who is only with her for the money and fame. Blue Racer: Because of her childish stunts in recent years and changing into a raunchy woman, she is losing all of her fans who used to adore her but now scorn, ridicule and make fun of her for her lying, hypocrisy and erratic behavior. Japanese Beetle: She might have had hit singles around the world but in America only has FOUR Top 10 singles which doesn't amount to diddley squat when sales keep falling ata lightning speed. Blue Racer: Her cover of My Prerogative is disgusting. She took a great song about Bobby Brown leaving New Edition into a Backstreet's Back Part II. Japanese Beetle: Do Something didn't do anything and that video made her out to be one ugly hooker! Blue Racer: Her fame in music has dwindled as her husband is stealing her money. Japanese Beetle: Britney has no looks anymore as her appearance has gone straight to Hell and her respect level is at zero and she deserves a HAASAH(karate chops her head off). Blue Racer: Her recent scandal involving her ugly baby Sean Preston has killed her career! Japanese Beetle: This album barely sold a million in the US as her popularity continues to wane and she wants a comeback, well it won't happen! SAYONARA!
B00005JO9J|4.0|Grey's Anatomy is a great show and it gets better with every episode. The characters are well rounded and I love their interaction. The medical cases are more in the background compared to ER but the show manages to stay realistic just as ER! It's just fun to watch and rewatch and watch again and again! <br /> <br />I only give four stars because the quality of the DVDs could be better, the sound is great but the resolution at some points is horrible! And sadly there are not so many specials. But the show is good in and on itself. So go buy and watch!

0441009425|5.0|The gigantic titles of \\"Redemption Arc\\", \\"Revelation Space\\", \\"Absolution Gap\\" are, for the first time, well spent on a published work of fiction.<br /><br />The action is set in a far, but yet not so far future. Reynolds describes the plot, the people and above all, the technology so vividly and in-depth, that it completely blows ones perspectives away. Has Reynolds actually been to the future and learned about all this technology, it's possibilities and possible galactic fates? This work and following books are for Science Fiction fiction is what Lord of the Rings was/is for Fantasy. I would even go as far to compare these books with Sir Arthur C. Clarkes \\"Rama\\" series, the Ultimate Science Fiction achievement.<br /><br />This is exceptionally skilled and very hard Sci-Fi. As when reading the Rama series, when the last page is turned, one gets the feeling of having had a glimpse into a very possible future. Very highly recommended.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I would call this a must have!  Great album over all, not one bad/boring song.  Tunes that you will hum along with until you learn all of the words and can sing along.  Only negative point is that the CD is just too short..
055380457X|2.0|This book reads like a 306-page promotional brochure for Google's two founders. There is nothing even slightly resembling good journalism. It is simply a glowing, smiley, hindsighted look at a story that was spoon-fed to the author by various sources and which should have been covered more diligently and far more impartially.

B000022TSY|5.0|Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's counter-culture flick \\"Easy Rider\\", like Warren Beatty's \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", launched the genre of low budget, independent film-making, and is as an important a film as it is a Hollywood milestone..When the studio system faded away (the back-lot assembly line), there was a vacuum in Hollywood and studio heads were gasping for fresh air?..The industry conundrum was, who would fill the void away from candy-corn musicals like \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"Mary Poppins\\", and \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\", that were putting movie-goers into a permanent state of snooze, and hemorraging red ink..Box-office receipts were in freefall, an omen revolution was in the air, and a upshift in audience taste was potentially going unrealized?..Columbia Studios figured they had to roll the dice, and test if a youth audience was ready in numbers to buy theatre tickets if original content was exhibited..Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda were seasoned Hollywood hands that survived the studio wars, and sensed the time was ripe to seize control of their careers by producing new wave content..Collectively, Fonda and Hopper scripted a contemporary \\"noir western\\" screenplay, Fonda as (Wyatt), Hopper as (Billy), two drugstore cowboys, mounted on \\"iron horses\\" on an existentialist journey to find America, that reflected the angst, paranoia, and prejudices permeating the Johnson/Nixon Viet Nam War era..\\"Easy Rider\\" is a biker odyssey, and the end-game is to get to New Orleans and \\"experience\\" Mardi Gras before the apocalyptic collapse of culture, an Edenistic premise..See the movie now, and excuse the dated 60's precepts..Realize the movie was an emboldened out-of-the-box move by its creators and Columbia..View the movie in context, and you will overlook its rough edges, and cardboard cut-out stereo-types..The movie occupies a sacred place in indie filmmaking, and paved the way for maverick film-makers like Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, and William Friedkin, meaning there are films today that stand on the shoulders of \\"Easy Rider\\", as primitive as the 16mm. film might seem relative to today's digitally enhanced standards..The film proved there was enormous profitability in \\"new realism\\", and ushered in packaging a rock soundtrack to accentuate the picture, at the time a sound-breaking strategy.

006056251X|5.0|I am a very big Lisa Kleypas fan. I love Romance Novels. The first Romance novel I ever read was \\"Again the Magic\\" by Lisa Kleypas at the age of 14. Now I am 16. I have gotten all of the 3 of the 4 \\"wall flower\\" books in the series in the first days that they were out. In the book \\"Devil In Winter\\" there are two main characters: Evangeline Jenner and Lord Sebastain St. Vincent. St. Vincent has a permiscouse past and Evie is a shy little angel. But after they marry Sebastian starts to have actual feelings for Evie. This is scarry for him because he has never had feelings for any woman in his life before her, and he didn't even want to be feeling them for her but when he does give in he is practically on his knees for her all of the time. Petes sakes he even takes a bullet for her life. And then there is Evie. She is shy in the beggining and will most of the time abide by his rules. Eventually Evie becomes a little \\"she-devil\\" that is in control of her life and Sebastian's!!! This book is great because it shows how much a man that is deeply in love will change for the woman of his dreams. <br />

I thought the characters were very well done and I think anyone that sees this movie will be able to relate to it in that we have all been there - either in love or thought we were \\"In Love\\", and of course the pain of the \\"broken heart\\", (oh heavens, you think you are going to die) at some time in our life.  I fell in love with the movie itself and bought several copies to give to my friends as gifts - because some of the characters were just like some of my friends.  SEE THIS MOVIE!  BE IN LOVE!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|First Impressions of Earth by The Strokes has scored a spot my winamp jukebox play list.  In fact it the first album I want to listen to when I turn on my computer.  Here's the breakdown.. This album is similar to the previous two as you can listen to all the songs and fully enjoy 'em.  Jules' vocals are much more melodic and I find myself singing along with 'em. The Strokes have successfully matched the vocals with the lead guitar, and it makes for a brilliant combination. I like to think of this album as background music, because you can push play and let each song continue without skipping over songs.  Both guitarist share lead parts which make for an interesting combo when you start picking each instrument apart.  I have nothing negative to review, and all expectations were fully met and exceeded.  Buy a copy for yourself and push play, and after a few times through you will find yourself singing along...enjoy
B000E41MS6|5.0|Every time a new Doctor took over the role, some of the Doctor Who fans complained that the new one wasn't a \\"real Doctor Who\\".  Generally, they were wrong.  This new one is no exception.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston brings considerable talent to the role, and his portrayal is odd and quirky, always a bit distracted, but not exactly like any of the other Doctors, which means that he really has managed to catch the essence of the Doctor.<br /><br />The Doctor always has at least one companion, generally a pretty female, and this Doctor is no exception.  Billie Piper plays Rose Tyler, who comes off as a bit of an airhead at first, but quickly shows herself to be someone that comes through in a pinch.  Of course, like all of the Doctor's companions, she also shows that she cannot follow simple instructions, but that has been true of every companion since Susan and Barbara.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are somewhat better, but still a bit cheesy.  Again, like the earlier versions.<br /><br />In essence, the people making the new series have an obvious respect and love of the earlier series.  No, it isn't exactly like the earlier shows.  If it were just a copy, then it really wouldn't be true to the spirit of the original.<br /><br />The show is fun to watch.  Once fans of the earlier shows get over the fact that neither Jon Pertwee nor Tom Baker will be back, they'll enjoy this verstion too.

0808514121|5.0|Steinbeck's reflection on the story of Genesis in the Bible is both intricate and reflective. The story serves to illustrate common themes and issues embedded within the family structure and society as well. He is also able to make a point about the existence of free will in each individual's destiny.     One of the aspects that make this book quintessentially American is the diversity of the characters' qualities, both good and bad. Lee is perhaps the most uniquely complex figure in the story-he is not only a role model and parental-type figure for both the Trask boys and Abra, but deeply philosophical about man's existence in life, and the struggles he faces. Lee really is the force that keeps the Trask family afloat when the strains of life hit several members, namely Adam. He is able to single-handedly pull Adam out of his disillusionment with Cathy. Lee is so poignant to the novel because he reaches others at a level that most fail to reach, and he helps Adam begin life anew with his two sons. Cathy represents one of the darkest and malicious characters in literature, and is seemingly at the opposite spectrum of Lee-she represents destructiveness, cruelty, thoughtlessness, and cynicism. Cathy (later Kate) is not only hurtful to others around her, but there are times when she literally shuns goodness when it is in close proximity to her. Even her physical condition, in which she hates to be around light, is representative of her sinister mentality about the world and her rejection of benevolence. Samuel Hamilton is depicted as a great man, a go-getter who captures the attention of his listeners because of his stories and his great vision for invention. Samuel is seemingly underappreciated by most in the novel with the exception of Lee and Adam, who cherish his knowledge. Samuel's impact on both Lee and Adam come much later in the story and after much reflection on their part.     Another compelling aspect of Steinbeck's work is the definition and reflection on the idea of wealth. In many instances, \\"physical\\" wealth means very little. Will Hamilton is a character who believes in the principle of attaining wealth, but is very one-dimensional. Cal first sees wealth as an access to gain favor with his father, but then winds up rejecting this idea, and literally burning the money he had acquired. Kate gains a good deal of money from her brothel business, but it is money that brings neither happiness nor goodness to others. In direct contrast to these characters, Samuel Hamilton and Lee embody a \\"spiritual\\" wealth in the novel. Samuel, for instance, works hard, invents many things, and collect very few material rewards, yet his friendship is the most significant to others. Lee, similarly, is not wealthy, and comes to terms with his role as a giver rather than one who needs to acquire monetary gains. He seems to accept this role, and even rejects the one chance he does have to go to San Francisco and begin a business adventure. Steinbeck's larger message could be that the notion of \\"wealth\\" is more symbolic than physical.     Perhaps the most consequential issue explored is that of free will-that we are all in charge of our own destinies despite our blood or our stations in life. This is revealed in Lee's explanation of the phrase \\"thou mayest\\", and the idea of choosing our own destination-good or evil-is illustrated most significantly in the character of Cal Trask-who wavers between choosing good and evil for much of the novel.     This is a thoroughly powerful book, perhaps one of the forgotten treasures in literature. Steinbeck is able to draw you in, and although this novel is quite lengthy (over six hundred pages in length), it is a captivating story with complex ideas, characters and symbols.
B00005JLEU|4.0|The first rule of watching this movie is simple: Just because something is animated it doesn't mean it's always for kids. Spirited Away is best for adults and older teens. Little ones will be disturbed. The best way to describe is that it's sort of like Wizard of OZ without music and set in fantasy Japan with ugly monsters.  <br /> <br />Instead of just getting home to Kansas the heroine has to save her parents and then make it back to the world of humans.  Except for one moment of stupidity and greed that gets the show started there is nothing interesting about the parents. This is a pretty good idea because their blandness is a huge contrast from the spirit world that Sen must go to to save them.  <br /> <br />Sen is a spunky kid with a kind heart. She's brave, resourceful and eventually wins over the cranky employees of the spirit world bathhouse. The bathhouse is a vacation spot for some incredible creatures. The huge radish spirit, silent and semi nude but wearing a juanty hat, was a standout. I've never liked raishes and now I definitely don't want any.  Most of the creatures are grotesque. I mean really disgusting, really creepy and that's one reason why the little kids should be put to bed before you watch the movie. There's also a great deal of chunky  vomit all over the place.   <br /> <br />The villianess witch is fantastic. She's cruel, funny and ugly. She's that nasty teacher who made your fifth grade absolute hell. She's that spiteful old biddy down the street who used to threaten to call the police if you walked to close to her lawn. She's that babysitter who didn't let you watch TV and sent you to your room until your parents came back. In short, she's a classic childhood fear figure. The witch does have one virtue. She loves her giant baby and that will be a huge help to Sen and her quest.  <br /> <br />I liked Spirited Away but I did think it's way too long and the ending where Sen FINALLY leaves with her boring and ungrateful parents (because theyhave no memory of ever being pigs under a spell) is an emotional let down.

B00005RIXP|5.0|I have seen 4 versions of Tosca, and this is the first one that left me a favorable impression of the title charachter. In the 3 other versions I saw, including one at the Met, the Toscas came off as cranky naggers, not passionate lovers.  I saw Marton in the Met's Turandot, and found her rather stiff.  But, here in Sydney, her body language comes alive, and you will instantly feel the intense jealousy that Tosca has for her lover. Until now, I mostly liked only the two famous arias by Cavardossi.  Now,I finally know why this opera has enjoyed worldwide appeal for so many years.  Brava, Eva Marton.
B00005JO04|5.0|The dark side of the geo politic agreements backstage which allow to sustain and maintain our living standard in a convulsed and extremely complex universe of ancestral beliefs, financials indexes, puppets authorities and dark affairs which concern with the national security and market laws constitute a very actual and competitive environment that will conform this accurate and meticulous portrait that describes with dazzling and brutal realism, those multiple linked facets and mirror games where every single movement is like a true chess game. A wrong move is the end of the game.<br /><br />George Clooney made a very convincing role (I start for notice his magnificent body language such his way of walking), the superb edition process and the synchronized script that seems to behave like a watch mechanism will demand from you all your possible attention.<br /><br />In spite of the abrupt ending, the film deserved a major relevance at the moment to consider them among the best entries of 2005, that will be remembered as one of the most critic ones in which artistic stature and creative punch concern.
038572179X|5.0|This novel is destined to become a classic.  It is in my opinion McEwan's best work to date, and it rivals many of the great 20th century masterpieces.  The plot was ingenious; the language was lush, and acutely descriptive.  As others have already stated, it is many stories rolled into one - a sensual and profound love story, a war story, a crime story, and more.  I could not put this book down once I started it. I disagree with some of the reviews that the descriptions in the book were tedious and overdone. To the contrary, I feel that the language was perfection and further propelled the story.  I recommend this to any serious reader.

1881273156|5.0|I freely confess to being what Peter Drucker calls a \\"mono-maniac,\\" which is a person who has reached a point in life where one really big issue drives them and all that they do.  As I think back on a life as a Marine Corps infantry officer and a clandestine case officer (spy), I really wish  that stuff like this was covered at every life stage--from Family Life in high school to Life 101 in college to \\"tradeoffs and compromises\\" in Officer Candidate School and at The Farm.<br /><br />As someone who is at the top of their professional game, and with what may well be one of the lowest \\"social IQS\\" around, I absolutely recommend this book, and its children-oriented companion, as gifts for those you care about how might be, like me, too focused on the \\"hard\\" world and not paying enough attention on the home front.<br /><br />It is a simple formula, easy to understand, easy to apply, and the book is a \\"soft\\" equivalent of a \\"2 x 4\\" hit on the head of a jackass--once the message is received, I think it does have some positive effect.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a big J.A. fan, not a purist. I am one of those people who can point out how much movie destory...well changes the original story. Trust me, there were a couple of parts that where in the book that were excluded from the film. There was even a scene was the scriptwriter should have caught( Lady Catherine de Bough came to visit Lizzy at night and made a comment about the garden then cut back to request well demand a private audience with Lizzy). <br /> <br />I have seen many versions of the P&P and this one is my favorite. The chemistry and acting was wonderful. I felt like for 2hrs I watching Lizzy and Mr. Darcy not Keira and Matthew.  Over all I felt like Charles Bingley was too naive and goofy. That was really the only character that I now despised. The interactions between all the characters are believible.  <br /> <br />Be warned that there is a lot of giggling in this more. A little bit more than I care for. I still think that the movie stays close to the characters' true nature(except for Charles. Read paragraph b/4 this one). I prefer not to disect every <br />character's personality. As far the extras, there aren't any deleted scenes (good thing....no confusion). They aren't the best package. Would I have bought the dvd just for the extras? Only if it was free. Out of the whole movie there is only one profane word at the end. I'm only 18 and don't have any children so I can't comment on where or not children should see this movie.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Great music and sound.
B00005JOE8|5.0|Poor Alan Moore has been a tortured man for some time. Two of his graphic novels have been turned into what can only be called - crap. However, V for Vendetta does not suffer such a fate. There are some discrepancies, of course, but the film as a whole is highly successful and very entertaining. <br /> <br />V for Vendetta is very well cast with loveable and hateable foils that make the film easy to follow. Portman is a joy as usual (not always). She is more than sufficient and brings much to her role as Evey. I was disappointed that they changed her profession (readers will catch my drift). However, the heart of her character is the same, and Portman does her finest, most touching work since Closer. V is well cast as well. I actually like the voice of Weaving coming from beneath that mocking mask, and his chemistry with Portman is remarkable considering that they are never actually face-to-face. <br /> <br />The political aims (Bush etc.) in the film are fairly open, and can sometimes be distracting. However, as a whole the film is true to spirit of the novel. The air of revolution is thick with ideals and freedom, and one can actually see the people coming to life. I also think that the ending scenes are beautifully handled as the country transforms from a society of drones to one of individuals. I think that most anybody can enjoy this movie, if only for its incredible action and surprising sensitivity. Remember, remember this film forever.
0471267554|4.0|This version of the \\"protein\\" diet brings the whole eating craze back to the center where it belongs.  It just doesn't make sense to eat dripping bacon and greasy cheeseburgers without any checks and balances.  The Paleo diet calls for a sensible approach to eating lean protein as did our distant ancestors, and reinstitutes the idea that fruit and vegetables should be a mainstay.  I do wish there was a more prominent place for whole grains, but who says you have to follow Paleo exactly? <br />Good nutritional information included in this book.
B00004S3AN|5.0|I loved this disc when I first heard it in the early 1960's and \\"had to have it\\".   It sounded great and was and still is some of the best jazz period.   Well the old LP is long gone, but not my fondness for the music so when I found that it was availabe in SACD, once again I \\"had to have it\\".   SACD is amazing! Listening to this album you would swear that it was just recorded. The sound is live and you could think that you are in the same space as the musicians. I don't know how the sound engineers did it but the five channel surround is very convincing. You never loose sight of the sound stage but the surround encompasses and lends an intimacy that stereo alone cannot provide. A \\"must have\\" for your SACD music library, but this dics is NOT a hybrid so it will not play on a standard CD player. Get a copy and enjoy!
B000E5N62U|2.0|Great production and grooves but somehow most of this album  is kind of boring coffee table music. One or two tracks stand out but I'm still waiting for it to grow on me.  I must admit that  before this was released I had bought 'Aja' on CD to replace vinyl and it is stuck in my head. Nothing will compare to 'Aja' or 'Scam' so maybe it's just me . I  still wouldn't say it was a 5 star CD.
B00004Y6NX|3.0|This is a good album from Dire Straits, but not the best. The great songs are classics Tunnel Of Love, Expresso Love, & Solid Rock. But, I get tired of this album really easy after 4 because I realize that this CD is a little slower. Try to get American Idiot from Green Day, it rocks harder and it is noisier and better than this. But I still love Dire Straits, they have talent and make great music.  <br />

B00004Y6NP|1.0|I can't tell how overrated this CD is. It is very overrated and boring. If you like sexy, overrated, sad, boring noise music buy this. The only good song is Money For Nothing and it is one of my favorite songs of all time. It is pure hard rock and heavy metal. But the rest of the songs are weak and dissapointing. If you really want a good Dire Straits CD, I recommend go pick up On Every Street 1991. It has one of the greatest songs rock ever done, Heavy Fuel. That one is a must-have. Dire Straits make slow and long music. If you want good music that is loud, pick up Green Day or Guns N' Roses insted. American Idiot CD ROCKS!
B00008OLYN|5.0|I just entered the wonderful world of Opeth by purchasing their latest release Ghost Reveries.  I realized right from the start that Opeth were exceptional-the quality of their music, their transitions from heavy to acoustic, their unique brand of progressive metal, and their overall sound.  Obviously, I sought to obtain more of their albums.  And so, I continued with this wonderful album, Damnation.  Ghost Reveries is great, but Damnation is beyond even that.   <br />The first thing that makes this album so good is the crystal-clear production.  This album probably has the most precise and wonderfully textured production I have ever heard.  The producer, Steve Wilson, is an absolute genius who might as well be the 5th member of this band.  His vocal harmonies and keyboards are an extremely tasteful touch to the band's sound as well as his mastering of the CD.  But he's not the only one who's extraordinary. <br />All of the band members are extremely talented, in particular the vocalist, who's the rhythm guitarist as well.  His singing is very emotional, personal, and melodic.  But he's not alone.  The bass I can hear loud and well, it keeps the rhythm section extremely solid along with the very technically-skilled drummer.  And the lead guitarist provides very emotional and tasteful soloing throughout, as well as adding the necessary electric guitar parts. <br />The whole album is great, not a single weak track.  If I had to choose my favorites, they'd have to be To Rid the Disease, Windowpane, In My Time of Need, Death Whispered A Lullaby, and Closure.  But even this may be pushing it because it's that hard to place one song over another.  Each song, with its acoustic touches, transitions so smoothly to the next track that this CD really requires it to be listened to from beginning to end.  However, this CD is a bit different from Opeth's other albums.  If you enjoy this kind of sound combined with a very heavy blend of metal, then I'd continue exploring the restof their catalogue.  But don't let this detract you though, their melodic elements remain in tact throughout and they are far beyond any other modern metal band today, with maybe the exception of Dream Theater (who I also recommend).  With that note, buy this album!
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones aren't a punk band. They are a hard rock heavy metal band. And all the songs on this album are heavy metal style. Joey <br />Ramone still sings the same voice though Johnny Ramone plays electric heavy metal guitar. The Ramones were always a rock and roll band.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have seen this movie on stage and on DVD at least 8 times. It is the best!
B0000255CL|5.0|This album is pretty different from their earlier fast and brutal albums (diabolical fullmoon mysticism,battles in the north,blizzard beasts..etc),but you will be amazed at how brilliant this album is , although it is slower in tempo , the guitar works are more complex and technical plus great drums fillings. Each song is longer (7-8 minute) than their usual previous albums. The grimness essence is still there and is standing as strong as ever. You can feel the soul of winter as if it is in you when you listen to this album. Every song is crafted so marvelously,it really shows the band's maturity musically and lyrically.Fantastic composition which isnt a surprise , they have always excel in that area.Like what the album is named, they really tap into the core of winter,the grimness and solitude. The best Immortal album ever. <br />All of the tracks are my favourites but to choose the best tracks personally,its Solarfall and At the heart of winter. <br /> <br />\\"The statue watches the kingdom your giant wings make all beneath <br />Im staring forth the raventhrone I know Im at the heart of winter...\\" <br /> <br />All hail the mighty Immortal. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JJX8|4.0|<br />Alfred Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF (1955, Paramount), which slipped through the cracks in Universal's stupendous 15-film boxed set, has been released on a Paramount Home Video DVD label.  With Oscar-winning color photography by the renowned Robert Burks on location on the French Riviera, the movie is like a relaxing travelogue.  The screenplay is by the great John Michael Hayes, who had just done REAR WINDOW (1954) for Hitchcock.  In a romantic mystery vein, THIEF is the perfect Hitchcock movie for viewers who like romantic mysteries with picturesque settings, but can't deal with graphic violence; THIEF has very little graphic violence. <br /> <br />We have Hitchcock's favorite leading man and leading lady here, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, at their most glamorous.  Cary is falsely accused of being John Robie, a notorious jewel thief.  Jessie Royce Landis, always fun in Hitchcock films, plays Kelly's mother.  Her jewels are stolen, and Grace is positive Grant took them.  So Cary has to stay away from the cops while also (1) romancing Grace in the hills above Monaco, and (2) finding the real cat burglar to clear his own name.  That's the whole plot.  The movie is very relazing and leisurely paced for 106 minutes.  Watch the outrageous picnic lunch scene, where Grace pulls out a chicken and asks Cary if he'd like a leg or a breast!  And the incredible love scene in a darkened room with kisses on a couch while spectacular fireworks go off outside the window like an epic orgasm. <br /> <br />Edith Head was costume designer here and must have had a field day working on the climactic masked ball, where Cary scampers across a night rooftop while the party goes on below.  He unmasks the real villain, while trying not to get shot by cops who are still positive (and in error) that Cary is the actual thief.  The DVD of TO CATCH A THIEF is a brand-new one in VistaVision and with several informative documentary bonuses.  Not a Hitchcock masterpiece, this is delightful, suspenseful, and scenic romantic mystery escapism that is still better than most lesser filmmakers' best work.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre and this greatest of all directors. <br /> <br />
0440236738|3.0|Many pepole recommend me to read that book. I live in israel and this book translated to hebrew, but I read it in english- l read book just in their original language. <br />this book, The axis that the plot spin, not interested me. All the staff about Covenant House was boring. The characters was boring. Its took me a month to end this book. the ending is very surprise and I can tell that my best time in this book was in the twenty minutes when I leaf through the last twenty pages. <br />beyond that I dont enjoy so much of the book. <br />despite this I will read Tell No One, beacuse I buy it already and I hope that It will be better. <br />I sorry but I disappointed from this book, even that many other review love him. Maybe is the topics of the book. I like books that deal with characters, that detail more the psychological espects of them, so I can identify with the character. because of this I enjoy the Goust character, especially in the end. He was character with very intersting psychological aspects. The other character was very flat and boring and beacuse of this most of the reading was boring.

0521397812|5.0|This book has been of limited usefullness for me. I've found only a few activities in here that would be practical for my classes of 40 Korean middle schoolers, but I also believe I'm in a bit of an unusual situation trying to teach English to such big classes. That being said, I did find it useful for, if nothing else, getting my own ideas rolling. I would also like to add that it's rather pricey for a flimsy little book, but I'm sure that if my situation were different it would have been well worth the money. I can pretty much recommend it to everyone EXCEPT those with unusually large class sizes, but it would be good for them too if they could find it used. Otherwise there are good resources to be found online for free.
0684824906|5.0|In \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,\\" Doris Kearns Goodwin confirms my belief that Abraham Lincoln was literally the only man in America who could have preserved the Union in the face of the Civil War.  The book offers parallel biographies of Lincoln and the three men who were his chief rivals for the Republican nomination for president in 1860--William Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates--as well as the man who would serve as Secretary of War for most of Lincoln's administration, the (War) Democrat Edwin Stanton.  The emphasis is on how their personal and political lives shaped their personalities and their destinies, as well as how circumstances compelled them to accept posts in the Lincoln cabinet and (with one notable exception) come to recognize that the president they served was the greatest man of his generation.<br /><br />Goodwin presents Lincoln as the first consummate politician, as indicated by the subtitle, which is to say that in being nominated for president he proved his rivals to be amateurs, making his surprising nomination seem totally inevitable.  The parallel biographies lead to a series of incidents in which Lincoln must manage not only these people but issues and events as well.  More importantly, she makes it clear that from at least his first defeat for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois in 1855 that Lincoln had been living by the words of his Second Inaugural address: \\"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right.\\"  Goodwin also emphasizes Lincoln's driving ambition of \\"being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem.\\"<br /><br />Otherwise, \\"Team of Rivals\\" reinforces the judgments history has made of these historical figures.  I continue to see both Chase and McClelland to be detestable figures, and the book gives me a much better appreciation of Seward (and also of Gideon Welles).  Lincoln is such a towering figure that a book like this does serve to remind you that these other men actually did things besides try to act as defacto president.  Goodwin also makes an effort to put Mary Lincoln in a better light, and highlights Lincoln's visits to the troops.  One of the key recurring elements is the way diverse parties as Frederick Douglass and the \\"Charleston Mercury\\" reversed their opinions about Lincoln as president, explaining why it was the most vilified American of the 19th century when he was first inaugurated would become a secular saint whose death was met with almost universal bereavement.<br /><br />The book ends with all of Washington present for the two-day \\"farewell march\\" of the nearly two hundred thousand Union soldiers past the reviewing stand on Pennsylvania Avenue.  All of the members of the cabinet were there, but not Abraham Lincoln.  Goodwin privileges a story told by Leo Tolstoy of how the name of Lincoln was known even to a tribal chief in the wild and remote area of the North Caucasus.  The epilogue covers the deaths of the principle members of Lincoln's cabinet and of Tad and Mary Lincoln (but not Robert).  However, Goodwin's thesis is well and truly proven when Lincoln accepts Chase's resignation, which would make the nomination of Chase as Chief Justice the pertinent epilogue.  But Goodwin can hardly be faulted for continuing to play out the rest of the war and Lincoln's life.  For me the most poignant moment in the volume comes when Seward, recovering from his own assassination attempt and spared the news of what happened at Ford's Theater, knows the president is dead because he sees a flag at half-mast and knows his friend would have been the first to visit at his bedside.<br /><br />As to being an implicit indictment of the current Cabinet, I suppose there is an attendant irony given that those who served Lincoln were under the mistaken belief they were smarter than the President.  But historically only the first cabinet selected by George Washington can measure up to the team Lincoln assembled (having both Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson settles that matter, although Henry Knox and Edmund Randolph are not slouches).  The Kennedy administration came make claim to having assembled  \\"The Best and the Brightest,\\" but that is hardly comparable to bringing together the biggest names in the party.  Still, obvious parallels between Stanton and Rumsfeld aside, the thought of John McCain serving in the Bush cabinet would certainly represent the sort of inherent tensions Lincoln faced repeatedly in his day. However, today Cabinet officers clearly function more as administrators and as advisors specific to their responsibilities, than as the general council on all matters political and military that Lincoln enjoyed.<br /><br />\\"Team of Rivals\\" does not break new ground in terms of Lincoln scholarship, but it does try to put Lincoln in a slightly different light, and if there is one figure in American history who deserves to be revisited from time to time, it would be Abraham Lincoln.  The crises, both major and minor, come so fast and furious during the Civil War that Goodwin cannot really justify using break them into discrete subjects worthy of individual chapters.  Consequently, once the book gets past introducing the primary figures, it sticks to a straightforward chronology.  There are close to a hundred contemporary photographs and illustrations throughout the book, but with an eye always turned towards irony, I note that the endpapers consist of a view from Pennsylvania Avenue of the unfinished U.S. Capitol in the 1850s, and a stereoscopic view of the finished building after Lincoln's death when the nation that was torn in two had been reunited.Lincoln assembled (having both Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson settles that matter, although Henry Knox and Edmund Randolph are not slouches).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you loved the series *Firefly* you simply have to buy this DVD boxed set. You've read the reviews by others, so I won't rehash what they've already stated about this fantastic show. Viewers who followed the show will be thrilled at the three never-before-seen episodes that are included. Plus, the shows are arranged in the order they were filmed-the way Whedon intended them to air, and not in the order Fox actually aired them, with the original two-hour pilot epiosode airing near the end of the series.<br /><br />All I want to know is what in the 'Verse was Fox thinking when they pulled the plug on this show? Have they learned nothing from NBC's cancellation of the Original *Star Trek*?<br /><br />Amazon's price can't be beat, either.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Personally, as a fan of the show, I thought this live adaptation was right on the mark. <br /> <br />The filmmakers found a good story that helps MAKE the live transition. The action sequences are orignal and nice to look at. But I think what makes this film pretty decent is the story and the question it poses about human cloning. What happens when it's all there is left? Do you do it to save humanity? Or follow the ambiguous moral ethics that seem to want to frown on the mere IDEA of cloning humans? With the scenario and the cloning question in place, it didn't make the movie unbelievable in any way.  <br /> <br />I think people just put too much expectation in an MTV movie and decided it was going to be bad before even seeing it. And by doing that actually BELIEVED it was bad while they were watching it. You want pure unadulterated cheesey badness...see \\"Ultraviolet\\". But this one was pretty good. Not exactly \\"The Fifth Element\\", but not a bad effort. Just give a chance, and you'll probably enjoy it. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is easily Green Day's best album.  For that matter it's probably one of the best rock albums released in the last 10 years.  This easily stacks up as a classic.  <br />From the classic Green Day-ish tracks like American Idiot to the giant epics like Jesus of Suburbia every song is great and most are huge steps forward for the band.  It's amazing listening to this album and going back and listening to Kerplunk or Dookie.  The amount of growth is stunning.  And overall the songs are so much better than their earlier work (and the earlier work was stellar).  If you get one CD from Green Day this would have to be it.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|There's no need for me to retell the plot of this movie.  Others have done that beautifully.  Let me just say that I have now purchased five copies (four to give away; one for me), and here's why: <br /> <br />1. Kiera Knightly is incredible as Elizabeth Bennet--youthful but wise, sweet but delightfully sarcastic, beautiful with a great touch of tomboy. <br /> <br />2.  Matthew Macfadyen's Mr. Darcy is perfect.  He gives the character just the right blend of pride and insecurity, with eyes so expressive that a sidelong glance speaks volumes.  And his voice...!  Oh my. <br /> <br />3.  The Bennet family is every family--a delightful jumble of diverse personalities bound by tears, laughter and love. <br /> <br />4.  The music. (I own the soundtrack, too.) <br /> <br />5.  The scenery. (Many Kodak moments.) <br /> <br />6.  And...the story.  Perfect.  Just perfect.   <br /> <br />Go, Jane Austen!!!!
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Watching this movie was like going back in time 230 years.  Kubrick's cinematography is superb; his use of natural lighting and stunningly beautiful European settings are quite impressive.  Critics of the film will invariably point out the flatness of the characters, slow pace of the film, and the length (3 hours).  There is some truth to these criticisms, but the total experience is well worth the investment of time.  There are so many mediocre films put out nowadays, you might as well watch something intelligent, well-made, and historically instructive versus the same predictable movie template that is made 10 times per year.  Watching this film feels like reading a great classic novel.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|As I purchased Love Actually I didn't think that I would receive it so quickly.  I actually purchased a few other dvds from some other vendors, but this one came the quickest.  Keep up the great service.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is the story of two all-man cowboys that find love in each other. The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?     Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).     What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of \\"Titanic\\" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly homosexual, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.     Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.     The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing.     I saw this movie over a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is a very full-toned and haunting picture. To say that it was the very best film that I have ever seen would simply trivialize it, because it is much more than just a movie.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|If you peel away the controversy, look past the fact that this film should have won the Best Picture Oscar, and forget the late-night Comedic jabs, you indeed are left with a wonderful, quiet film. Devoid of any exploitation and containing little violence, \\"Brokeback\\" emerges as a wonderfully written, skillfully directed story of two men, circa 1963 that are unable to share their love openly. The performances range from excellent (Jake Gyllenhaal and - especially Michelle Williams) to the amazing, career-defining performance of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar. Known beforehand as a pretty-boy Austrailian Actor, Mr. Ledger masterfully keeps Ennis Del Mar's emotions as tight as a balled-up fist as he is incapable of to show Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist the depth of his love. The final 30 minutes of this film are as wrenching and honest as anything committed to film. Don't miss this film
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Argh!  I can't believe that this was canceled.  I really don't watch much TV, but this was a great show.  I am glad I made the plunge and purchased it.  You just don't see characters like this anymore.  Their bonding is great and the plots are just plain fun.  Anyone who like sci-fi will thoroughly enjoy this.  Lets hope we'll see more shows in the future.
B00005JOE8|5.0|V for Vendetta is a well-crafted movie with an engaging storyline, excellent acting, and enough visual effects and stunts to keep the action moving. On that note, there are some who will not like it, thinking it too dark, too cliched, and in some cases (although I'm not naming names) too liberal. <br /> <br />   What is interesting is that, while one of the story's main themes is terrorism (and what is the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter?) the two acts of \\"terrorism\\" that V commits are heavily sanatized. He blows up two buildings (big deal, you'll see more destruction of public property in the Mission Impossible III trailer than you will in this movie), in the dead of night when no one is inside them. In real life, terrorists don't generally wait until no one is inside a building to blow it up; after all, you tend to generate more terror when lives are lost. More violent is his personal vendetta against high ranking members of the government to whom he metes out his own idea of justice. <br /> <br />   The acting is excellent. I don't care what anyone says about Natalie Portman's accent difficulties. I'm American and admittedly I'm not very good at telling different British accents apart, however, I refuse to waste my time nitpicking about her accent instead of paying attention to her words and her body language and the way she interacts with the characters around her and her effect on them (such as V and Finch).  <br /> <br />   Hugo Weaving (working at a huge disadvantage because he never removes the mask) lets V's favorite weapons, words, roll over us and he uses his sonorous baritone as well as his body language to wonderful effect. It won't get him any Academy nods, which I think is a shame, but it's a performance well worth seeing. <br /> <br />   And the rest of the supporting cast is very good as well- Finch, Dedritch, Sutler, and Creevy come to life as well realized characters. John Hurt, especially, as Sutler is wonderful. You can see the zealotry as spits his words over the looming screen as he speaks to his subordinates. (And on a lighter note, his moment of Benny Hill slapstick is hilarious as well as insightful). <br /> <br />   The film's second motif, the idea of the mask, has many people drawing parallels to The Phantom of the Opera. To anyone insisting that this is a cliche, I can only say that using masks as a storytelling device is well known from Classical Greek and Roman plays to Shakespeare (Twelth Night is heavily quoted in in V, and wasn't the only one of Shakespeare's plays to use the idea), and onward. The reason it's used so much is because it's a facinating reflection of another theme of this movie-what is identity? If terrorism and violence provides the cerebral A plot of the story, V's self-realization of who he is and what he has become provides the heart of the story. <br /> <br />   If you do not like the thought of bittersweet or ambigous endings, or if you go to the movies simply because you want to be entertained, you may not enjoy V for Vendetta. It is certainly entertaining, but it is written on enough different levels that it requires you to think. It can be watched more than once and if you pay attention, you will find something new to think about each time, while still enjoying the action sequences and the stunts.
0688014291|5.0|I have read this a couple of times in my career already, but the new boss just bought a hardback copy for his management team so I read it again. It doesn't take long.  <br /> <br />The authors of the negative reviews here miss the point. It's not a management tome meant to provide day-to-day advice, but rather a parable offering a timeless philosophy: Tell your employees what you expect, offer timely feedback and exhibit support. <br /> <br />One reviewer recommended an annual reading. I concur. It's easy to get lost in the specific details and lose sight of foundation principles. Buy the hardback, read and reread. Yes, there is a lot of whitespace, but it's about the message. It's not rocket science, but it's timeless. You and I could have written it, but Blanchard and Johnson beat us to it. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for a very long time. But everytime a see it I have to wonder why the main character was played by such a bad actor. Everyone else in the movie did a pretty good job (even the girl who had virtualy no acting experience). The movie would have been better if he was the first one \\"jacked\\" instead.
B00005JO20|4.0|For special effects, this movie was awesome,But I must say, the actors were \\"whimpy\\" at best.Put those \\"original actors\\" from King Kong 33, and there would be a perfect Kong movie. I guess those actors represent todays times, cheap toasters and whimpy <br />actors.God, they made great actors of the past, alias, no more, skip the first hour, save the grit for later, for best actor? <br />KONG BY FAR.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I saw this on PBS last night.  Lip synching or not, it's beautiful to watch and great \\"chill out\\" music to listen to.<br /><br />I plan to listen to it more than watch it.  I've got my DVD player sound running through a quality 1970's era stereo system, and the picture through a little 15 flat panel tv, so I'll just treat this as a beautiful music CD that I can also watch if I want to.  The price is right.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|Oh, no, this is A Day Without Rain, Revisited. Roma Ryan's venturing in a new, self-made language? The proverbial \\"have a minimalistic song first, then bring the Enya Chorus out for the next one\\" album structure? Where's your newest \\"Caribbean Blue\\" (intricate and tasteful keyboard layering), your \\"Cursum Perficio\\" (tension builder), your \\"Boadicea\\" (hummable -no pun intended- melody, so strong that even tripe like The Fugees versioned it) your \\"Storms in Africa\\" (fun, orchestral treatment, with the cool drums to match), girl? Where's your newest \\"Only If?\\" Had you rehashed THOSE, this would be palatable.  <br /> <br />Enya is, as always, her perfectionistic self, and her singing is as  sweet as ever. There are hints here and there that this album could be more experimental than it was (particularly \\"Sumiregusa\\" ), but the Lothrian tracks? Ridiculous... <br /> <br />On the other hand, \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" is the only remotely decent lyrics track on this record. Of course, a disclaimer is in order, since Miss Brennan doesn't go out more, period. You should, girl. Dump the Ryans' treatment for one track at least, please. For once. Go out, have a date or two, girl. Experiment. Get your sisters to sing with you at least once (they're coming up with great stuff on their own) If you want to go classic, you can sing with a string quartet backing you, and you may save the 499 other overdubs with a little dose of reverb. It will be as good, and definitely more refreshing. <br /> <br />Enya, you are a strong singer, a talented instrumentalist, an imaginative arranger and a good-looking, rich, nice, tortured soul who deserves better. You're now preaching to the converted, but you're losing me as a fan. I don't want to see what comes out in five years if I don't see a radical change in lyrical and melodic approach.

B000002LUB|5.0|The ultimate heavy metal album with thumping bass, and endless guitar rifts if you like Dio /Rainbow , you must have this album. <br />Dios contribution to Rock is timeless, he never fails to please . <br />The Sabbath lads hadnt lost anything either and although the both forms of Sabbath are very different they both have much to offer heavy metal fans. <br />If you havent got Heaven and Hell , Mob rules and Dehunanizer  <br />and you love Sabbath or Rainbow , get into them, they just dont date. <br /> <br />In the words of Dio <br />Long Live Rock and Roll
0792164903|3.0|Killer movie, love the special appearance by Cristopher Walkin as the headless horseman. Makes the movie much better.
B000002KMY|3.0|Another heavy offering from Dio and the Sabbath crew, a must for all Dio fans.  I saw this line up back in 1980 in Sydney at the princess theatre and got blown away , it doesnt get any better. <br />Not as good as Heaven and Hell which is one of the top 3 rock albums of all time. <br />Bass fans will love Geezers work which as always is outstanding. <br />In the words of Dio we rock . <br />cheers.
0743487478|5.0|Kohn does an exceptional job of making parents rethink their entire approach with children, and gives much healthier alternatives for everyone involved.  In this book, he gives multiple reasons why this is necessary and gives multiples sources for every point he makes.  He is a fantastic researcher and I'm thrilled that he's written this guide for parents.  Even before reading the book, I have been practicing this form of parenting with my children and have seen firsthand how well it works.
0689859368|3.0|*I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could <br /> <br />It seems that this book is primarily for children, but the beautiful cover art as well as promising concept, along with an intriguing warning \\"go away, close the book, put it down, don't look\\" on the back of the book, all contribute to making this book a must-have for a fantasy reader. <br /> <br />This book has flaws, but not many; the story is told in a very `to-the-point' manner.  Much of the story, in fact, seems to be have left to the other volumes.  It will take the average reader an hour at most to finish this book-if I were writing the Spiderwick Chronicles, this `Book 1' would only be the introduction chapters.  Imagine if \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" ended as soon as Harry discovered he was a wizard; it would have still been a promising book, but the lack of MORE story in these books makes $9 and change quite a large price for such a small volume.  On the other hand, it's nice to have a short little story, the only problem is the price. <br /> <br />Despite all of this, the little bit of story that IS told in this book makes me immediately ready for Book Two.  My first thought after reading this tale was not \\"what a great story!\\" it was \\"I wish I had the next volume.\\"  Although Spiderwick Chronicles is a very intriguing story, with a promising concept, and likable characters, it is only the beginning! <br /> <br />I can't wait to read Book Two. <br />
B000E6UK5K|5.0|If your favorite Floyd songs were David Gilmour numbers then this CD is for you.  If you liked Narrow Way from Ummagumma, Fat Old Sun from Atom Heart Mother, Childhood's End from Obscured by the Clouds, Comfortably Numb from The Wall, then you will love this CD.  If you liked Short and Sweet, So far Away, Out of the Blue, and Near the End from David's solo albums, then this CD is for you.  To understand Pink Floyd, go back to Ummagumma, the studio album where each band member makes a contribution. Here you have Roger Waters making irritating animal sounds while David Gilmour comes up with the trademark future sound of Pink Floyd in Narrow Way, great soft voice soaring guitar -- music that floats you in the air.  If  irritating animal sounds are your idea of Pink Floyd, you can still get them ... just buy Roger's solo CD's -- his voice has degraded that much.  In any case, all you one-star reviewers should be thanking David for the trademark Floyd sound.  If you want to talk about some inane lyrics take a look at Amused to Death ... maybe they're deep if you haven't grown up in the almost 40 years that Floyd's been around...
B0000844I8|4.0|I never really liked this movie but I figured to $6.99 was a good deal for the first half, which is the only part really worth watching. <br /> <br />The new extended version VASTLY improves upon the theatrical release.  There are scenes and dialogue added that make the movie make so much more sense now.  Before it seemed superficial and vague and now there's a lot more context and backstory concerning Jaye Davidson's character, for example. <br /> <br />I still only think it's a 3 star movie because there just isn't much to the story anyway, but the low price gives it that extra star.  It's now worth buying to have in your collection.
0793542049|4.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for.  It gives the reader the bare essentials with no extraneous material to guide the reader step by step to building musical, flowing bass lines.  I highly recommend it.
0425132153|5.0|I am not British, and I dont always \\"get\\" their humor ( humour ), but this book spoke to me.  It was funny, philosophical, irreverant and a joy to read.   <br />I now fear not the end of times, and am actually scared that if it were to happen, this book probably wouldnt be too far off. <br />I thought it was well written and very funny.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This Album is great! I listened to it all the way through yesterday in my mates car and its great. Its a real feel-good album! Made me feel good anyway! I dont know why some people come on here just to say a bad word about Kanye it doesnt help anyone and it definetly doesnt help the people saying it! He CAN rap and to all of those who think he cant then you obviously dont listen to him properly! <br />Amzing album and i hope to see more in the future!!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|In the same style as the Sea Hawk, this movie has action, and adventure, with all the story you could want. Age has not dulled the vitality of this movie. The way this movie was done for its day shows that the movie is far more than just the special effects, but it is all about the acting, and the filming of the emotions.... great film.. grab your sweety, and introduce her to justice and honor, and the man who made honor the thing to do, and romance what it should be.

The movie showed the true honor and life of Brother Malcolm and how his life was and how he influence his people bye speaking the truth and what needed to  be said.

His words are what's happening right now, he was ahead  of his time.Brother Malcolm was our hero and our leader,now and forever Tammantha Shaw.
0307276902|5.0|As I began reading A Million Little Pieces, I was kind of skeptical at first, considering all the controversy surrounding the author and his so-called \\"fabrication\\" of the story.  I began reading the novel with many questions, and as I read page after page, I kept asking myself how in the world could someone think like this person did.  I absolutely could not put the book down.  Yes, it was sometimes harsh, blatant, and just plain gross, but James Frey simply has the ability to keep the pages turning.  I really liked how he wrote this book without really worrying about grammar, capitlization, or any mechanics for that matter.  It was very conversational, and I almost felt like I knew this guy and the troubles he was going through.  I also liked how the author made his life sound extremely awful in the beginning (which I'm sure it really was) and then gradually comforted the reader by making him become a better person throughout the book.  James Frey kept me thinking throughout the entire book, I always had questions about what was going on, what in the world would happen next, and how could anyone survive what he went through.  This book was kind of easy to read, I had to go back a few times and re-read certain parts, but for the majority of the reading, it was simple yet dramatic.  Frey uses many descriptive words that give the reader an exact picture of his surroundings, lifestyle, and what the future will or will not hold.  This book is not meant for young people to read.  I almost found some parts disturbing in the very first part of the book, but in the end everything continuously got better.  I think this book was breathtaking, with a little bit of uneasiness.  I am very anxious to read his second book, My Friend Leonard, to see how everything else turned out.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is huge. So is the bang the comes with her confessions. I just love every track on here. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a CD through and through. This album helps me get through my painful housework day after day. Buy it folks, for the sake of your ears and ass.
B000001ELD|3.0|At the time this came out I liked it ok.  As the years went by I grew to hate it.  But now I've come full circle.  For what the band was going through it really wasn't that bad of an effort from Gene.  He stays true to his beliefs and gives us a decent set of songs.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a story like no other. It's a fast-paced sci-fi fantasy based solidly in the near future. Orson Scott Card crafts a  character out of Ender Wiggin that is so intelligent, brutal and cruel, and yet so tragically innocent and endearing that it makes up for any minor flaws in his writing. While it is difficult to imagine a young child so complex, Card takes his characters to a level so few writers can.<br /><br />In the back drop of Ender's Game, Card is building a geopolitical struggle for power on Earth. He carries this tapestry of warfare and hegemony into a parallel series based on a supporting character in Ender's Game, Bean. If the political background of Ender's Game appeals to you, I strongly urge you to read on into Ender's Shadow and then follow that series to the Shadow of the Hegemon and so on. Personally, I strongly prefer this branch of the Ender saga.
B000002JS6|5.0|1979: Bon Scott is the lead singer of AC/DC, a working class band that has slowly built a devoted cult fan base.  Highway to Hell finally gives them the needed shot in the arm to get up the charts and expands their fan base.  Feb 19, 1980: Bon dies from exposure after a night of binge drinking.  Shortly thereafer the remaining members of the band go into the studio with a new singer.  The results should have been disastrous.<br /><br />But they were not.  Like I said.  This is the big one from them.  The ultimate rain maker.<br /><br />But is it really good?  Does it still hold up?  Let me answer by reminding everyone of one song, 'Hell's Bells'.  Every sporting arena and stadium has the intro to this song handy.  They play it at nearly every game.  It's so catchy that thousands of people automatically get the idea when they hear it.  It's the sound of something big that is about to happen.  And that's the way the album starts.  Buy this cd and put it on.  Tell me that the intro to 'Hell's Bells' doesn't get you every time (and you've heard it a million times).  Of course it does.  And then you get the songs.  'You Shook Me All Nite Long', 'Back In Black', 'Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution'.<br /><br />Yeah, it holds up.
2070364232|5.0|It would be hard to overstate the charm of these wonderful stories.  Like many others, I picked up this book to help with my project of trying to teach myself French.  Not only does it serve that purpose, but it is so engaging that it has held me on course when the inherent difficulty of the language and some cross-cultural exasperation has tempted me to chuck the whole project.  No way could I ever write this little dude and his copains out of my life.<br /><br />Although hilarious, the Nicolas stories also touch you in a much deeper place.  He is a little boy full of life and good humor, but he and his friends are also filled with every possible anxiety about growing up and finding their manly places in the world.  They are charmingly obsessed with their status and their dignity.<br /><br />One of my favorite stories is \\"Louisette,\\" which recounts the visit of a young girl who comes with her mother for tea.  Nicolas is pouty from the beginning as his mother dresses him up, in his view, like a clown.  And maman assures him that if he doesn't show that he is well raised, he will have an affair with her!<br /><br />Although Nicolas is always filled with explanations that burst forth in run-on sentences, this traumatic visit brings him close to tears more than once.  In Nicolas's world, not crying is one of the main imperatives.  Another is assuming a male's naturally dominant [irony] and superior role over young girls, who, after all, cry all the time.<br /><br />Louisette starts off telling Nicolas that he looks like a monkey and things go downhill from there.  She is so much more quick-witted, not to mention athletic, that she repeatedly leaps ahead and distracts him just when he is deciding whether to give her a punch in the nose or to pull her hair.  And it is Louisette who is landing all the successful coups on Nicolas.  Meanwhile, Louisette is always batting her eyelashes at the mamans and impressing them with what an adorable innocent she is!<br /><br />As with the \\"Louisette\\" story of a young boy having to deal with a very formidable young girl who does not fit into his template defining his superior place in the world, all these stories are filled with such very real anxieties of male childhood.  Let me say again, though, they are very, very funny!  You love this kid.<br /><br />How easy/difficult is this book for a student of French.  My feeling is that previous reviews have made it seem a little easier than it is.  There are definitely difficult bits such as when Nicolas is playing cowboys and describes all the various cowboy accoutrements that he and his friends have hung on themselves.  Often, too, sentences are very run-on, mimicking Nicolas's overflowing emotions and self-justifications.  And the mannerisms of his speech are realistic and more difficult than the dry dialogue of textbooks.  But this is worth a little difficulty - I just want to caution against expecting a child's book to be extremely easy.  It is manageable, but not in the first few weeks of studying French.<br /><br />I also have a two-CD set of these stories read in French which I ordered from Amazon.fr.  The CD set is a dramatic reading and it is an absolute delight.  But it is considerably more difficult than the book.  Those run-on sentences are read in rapid bursts, as intended.  The reading wonderfully captures the charm of the book but definitely does not make it any easier.<br /><br />My only exasperation with the Nicolas books is that I can not share them with my English-only friends.  They touched me so much and made me laugh so hard.  I hope I have inspired someone here.r />As with the \\"Louisette\\" story of a young boy having to deal with a very formidable young girl who does not fit into his template defining his superior place in the world, all these stories are filled with such very real anxieties of male childhood.

Lot of cool guitar riffing fills the song out.<br /><br />Arizona is also a blast.<br /><br />Even Blackout is generally considered a commercial compromise by the band there are some fantastic moments.<br /><br />Add to your 80's collection and enjoy.

Now Mariah comes back with a cd that is good haters and riders wanna bite her some people cant stand her because she can actually sing. But oh well her cd still became one of the best selling CD's again no female artist dare to work with her of fear of being over shawdowed by her powerful voice. Jessica Simpson has said Mariah is one of the best singers of our time uh I don't see Brittany Spears or the Pussy Cat Hoes getting that. I know ignorant people are going to hate my review because I'm speaking the truth but oh well  thats why they call yall haters and drama is your game. Mariah has been in the game for a while and one hit wonders will come and go but the Queen of the Vocals is still here
B00004Y6O9|5.0|From 'Running With The Devil' through 'On Fire' the band plays a tight set that was recorded almost completely live.  You get over dubbed guitar on one song - Jamie's Crying.  The songs are not just boring heavy metal guitar exercises either.  Every song is catchy.<br /><br />There are no serious messages to be found in any of these songs.  Just pure fun.  This is the ultimate music for riding around in your car.<br /><br />Even though VH 1 came out a million years ago the songs hold up well.  It's heavy pop music and it's great!<br /><br />This cd comes with the highest recommedation.
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|I've always enjoyed The Strokes. \\"Is This It?\\" hooked me as a fan, and while I wasn't quite as big on \\"Room On Fire\\", I thought it to be an excellent sophomore attempt, albeit a change from their traditional style. <br /> <br />\\"First Impressions Of Earth\\", however, I've found for the most part to be downright terrible. I'd honestly have to say the best track on the album is \\"Juicebox\\", with Casablancas' unintelligible lo-fi nonsensical shouting that used to accent and add to The Strokes' songs but now completely drowns it out, only because it's got a promising intro. \\"YOU'RE SO COOOOLD, YOU'RE SO COOOOLD, YOU'RE SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD\\". Mmm, real talent there. <br /> <br />And that's the best track.  <br /> <br />Then we get into tracks like \\"Fear of Sleep\\" where Casablancas starts whining like a 2nd-grader whose mother has made him sit in the corner...\\"YOU'RE NO FUUUUUUUUN, YOU'RE NO FUUUUUUUUN\\" for about 10 minutes straight. (Here I was thinking longer Strokes' songs was going to be a good thing). Or \\"15 Minutes\\" which, for the first 10 seconds, starts out nice as a slow track, but then picks up tempo and blends into the formula for the rest of the album; Julian shouting and screaming and ruining the rest of the unendurable 4 1/2 minutes of the song. <br /> <br />I could go on and on and on about the songs on this album, but I can basically sum it up nicely by saying it's all the shouting and lo-fi screaming that people *think* made \\"Is This It\\" an excellent album, mixed in with a whole lot of painfully off-key and out-of-touch-with-the-music vocals (Julian has never had the greatest voice but he's just making it more obvious), and tired guitar riffs that echo throughout the entire album, without the pleasant, catchy riffs and at least somewhat intelligible lyrics that really did make \\"Is This It\\" a success. <br /> <br />Skip this rubbish and spend your money on \\"Is This It\\" or \\"Room On Fire\\" instead. \\"First Impressions\\" will be Julian's last impression on my ears.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Updated Review - March 2015<br /><br />Frank Miller's graphic comic-books come to breathtaking life in Robert Rodriguez's dazzling and extraordinarily violent film. \\"Sin City\\" centers around 3 engaging stories. The first involves Marv (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a messed up, ill-faced tough-guy on a quest to bring his lover's killer to justice. The other deals with the slick, Dwight (Clive Owen), an imposing, trench-coated charmer who unwittingly sets off a chain of unfortunate events by defending his smart-mouthed, physically abused girl-friend (the late Brittany Murphy). The final entry involves the tormented Willis and his love for a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) who he once rescued as a young girl from a heinous kidnapper and has to do so again when the monstrous villain returns with vengeance on his mind.<br /><br />This film looks splendid. The sets, costume design, cinematography and art direction are top-notch. The film is so visually breathtaking that the images and characters depicted may stay in your mind long after the closing credits. The entire film is shot in awesome black and white and every once and a while a dash of color is added enhancing the visual impact. There really isn't an action movie in recent memory that was this visually stimulating and artistically creative. Rodriguez successfully captures the essence of the comic-book characters without making them appear one-dimensional (It should be noted that Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are also given directing credits).<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" the comic books are not child's play so it's useless to expect the same from the film. The characters are all violent, impulsive and amoral individuals who kill without an ounce of remorse. The violence is graphic but the grisly gore scenes are executed so brilliantly that there really isn't that many moments in this film where the squeamish will be turning away or covering their eyes. They'll be too busy admiring the awesome beauty of the cast, the eye-catching visuals and the skill-fully choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />Spectacle aside, the star-studded cast also deserves mention because they all give exceptional performances. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke are the stand-outs. Both actors are compelling to watch especially Rourke who commands our attention and makes the most out of his vicious but sympathetic character. The luminous Jessica Alba also stands out. Her platinum hair, gorgeous figure and ridiculously charming presence makes a delightful Nancy Callahan. Other's in the impressive cast include Powers Booth, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen and Elijah Wood.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is a work of art. The luscious visuals, Miller's colorful characters, the film's bleak, desperate setting and Rodriguez's/Miller's/Tarantino's masterful direction all contribute into making this one of the best feature films of 2005.

B00082IJ08|5.0|This CD is really good. I am not an alternative music listener, but i heard the single, \\"Feels Good\\" at my company Christmas Party. I really liked the song and had to search for the name and the artist. Once i found that, i went to amazon.com  and ordered it. I only thought i would like the song \\"Feels Good\\", but it turned out the whole CD is great. Highly recommended.
0452282152|5.0|This marvelous story was inspired by the famous 17th century painting \\"Girl with a pearl earring\\", by a Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer. It describes the every-day life in Delft, a town in Netherlands, in the 17th century.  <br />It all starts when a 16-year-old girl, Griet, after her family's misfortune, has to leave her parents' house and go live in the Vermeer household, and be their made.  <br /> <br />The author is excellent in painting the picture of Griet's life in the family and the relationships between her and her mistress, her mistresses mother, all the children, another made, and of course, the unique relationship between her and her master, Vermeer.  <br /> <br />Tracy Chevalier's style is beautiful and elegant. Even though she uses a lot of descriptions, it doesn't make the reader lose it's interest; it actually, in simple way, draws a vivid picture of the town, people and every day life, i reader's mind. Even with English being my second language, I didn't find it difficult to understand this book, exactly because of her simple, but at the same time, perfectly chosen and beautiful language. She writes in combination of dialogues, inside monologues, and narration. It is written in the 1st person, so the whole story is told by Griet, and from her point of view. This way of writing draws the reader in, and so he/she inconspicuously becomes a part of the story.  <br /> <br />This book captured my full attention from its first page, and there was not one part of the story that made that attention drop, even a bit. Through Griet, we become a part of a perfect story of strong, unusual emotions; emotions of love combined with admiration, respect and even fear. This is a book that drags those emotions and feeling in, between the lines, and reader can just simply feel them, even though they are not clearly described.  <br /> <br />The author takes usual things and describes them with strong images, giving attention to details, so we can see it, feel it, hear it, taste it. One of the numerous great pictures is the description of the piercing of Griet's ear, and putting the earring through it. I could feel the pain, but also at the same time, her master's touch on her ear, the warmth of the needle, the trembling of her jaw, and the excitement in her heart.  <br /> <br />What I found interesting as well, is how the author also gives us vivid and precise descriptions of Vermeer's paintings, shows us how he got ideas for them, the way he would position his models, the way he maid paint...  <br /> <br />There is not one thing I don't like about this book. Everything- the story, the style, language, characters, atmosphere, the whole idea of writing a novel that has the historical base, is simply wonderful.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone who likes stories with strong and a little bit different and uncommon emotions, we sometimes even forget they exist.  <br />
B000BB1MIC|5.0|The fifth season of Gilmore Girls is yet another great season to be sure. Leading actresses Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham will keep you laughing, crying, and of course waiting for the next witty comeback. Granted they have a special mother/daughter relationship that is unique to them, but they seem so real that you can not help but to want to be best friends with them. If you are a Gilmore fan or just getting on the band wagon you will love every minute of the fifth season of Gilmore Girls.
B000055XMF|5.0|Very few movies based on rock albums are ever any good. \\"Quadrophenia\\" is the exception to this theory. Considering the relative inexperience of cast and crew alike, the producers have pulled off the unexpected: a rock film that doesn't bow down to the egos of the rock stars; a low budget, anti-special effect film; a teen film that doesn't condescend to the teens in the film and the audience; and, ultimately, a script that is not dictated to by the songs on the album. In fact several key songs from the album aren't even in the film--not the least of which is \\"The Punk Versus The Godfather\\". <br /> <br />What I enjoyed about the film, also, was that it doesn't just portray the working-class teen as a malcontent who can't identify with anything. Instead, Jimmy (played brilliantly by Phil Daniels) rebels against Rockers, the \\"establishment\\", older people, etc.; however, his desire for independence only goes so far because he MUST be a Mod. And here is the real ambivalence of adolescence--the desire to be free and the need to fit in.  <br /> <br />This edition has some fun extras. The director's commentary, although occasionally bogged down in technical stuff, is eye-opening to the era represented in the film. The high-speed London to Brighton trip is enjoyable. The Mod/Rocker Quiz was also fun--but beware of one of the endings! In sum, this is a worthwhile film to own.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Phillip Seymore Hoffman is nothing short of astonishing in Capote. He never overly imitates the well known, and often mocked, speech patterns or mannerisms of the writer Truman Capote, but rather nails his essences without turning to parody. The film itself is absolutely mesmerizing, a beautiful, subtle, and beguiling tale, of love and art and journalism; it's terrific movie that thoroughly deserves all the accolades.  <br /> <br />The film begins in the late '50s when Capote, fresh off the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's. He's now become part of the intellectual and artistic elite, a doyen of the salons and private parties of the Upper East Side and secure in his world and reputation as the New Yorker's best and brightest author.  <br /> <br />One afternoon he reads a short newspaper article in The New York Times about the slaying of a rural Kansas family, the Clutters. Something about the gravity of the murders captivates him, and Capote decides the topic is perfect for The New Yorker magazine, an article in which he will show the effect of such a brutal murder on the inhabitants of a small town.  <br /> <br />Within days he heads to the community of Holcomb, Kansas in the company of his boyhood chum, Harper Lee, (a fabulous Catherine Keener), soon to write her one and only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee serves as his enabler, helping Capote ingratiate himself into the close-knit, and somewhat intolerant, community, as he attempts to make contact with the town's law enforcement professionals and, ultimately, the perpetrators of the deed.  <br /> <br />As the narrow minded law enforcement officials, led by Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) reluctantly give Capote information about the crime, the young reporter befriends one of the imprisoned convicts, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) in order to extract as much of his personal perspective about the killings as possible.  <br /> <br />But it's a relationship forged in dishonesty - it's the story and not the lives ofthe murderers that really compel the author - and whilst there's obviously an attraction there - they're both eccentric outsiders from the wrong side of the tracks - Capote is shown as ultimately more concerned about getting the story, as he does his best to postpone Perry's execution until he can get all the information that he needs. He must find out exactly what happened on that night in 1959, and he does such a good job of manipulating Perry's trust so that Perry believes he has a friend who will fight for his life.  <br /> <br />Director Bennett Miller, writer Dan Futterman, and most of all actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman capture this process with exquisite accuracy and with the smallest of flourishes. The genius of the film, besides Hoffman's stunning performance, is that it knows exactly how much is enough. It never overplays, lingers or punches up.  <br /> <br />The dialogue is intelligent; each scene is carefully laid out, with a gorgeously minimalist piano score that heightens the emotional tension between the characters. Meanwhile, the gray ominous sky and the flat, severe landscape of Kansas, the horizon a hundred miles out, lends its own atmosphere to the proceedings.  <br /> <br />Did Capote eventually fall in love with Perry? Perhaps, but you leave the film with a definite sense that Capote's feelings towards the condemned man were enigmatic at best, he was a man torn between finding the story and his very real concern for the fate of another human being. Capote is presented here, flaws and all, as someone rather despicable, but he was also quite sensitive. The anguish he suffers at the results of his decisions emerges as our only glimpse of his potential redemption.  <br /> <br />Capote is a stunning film, and a superb drama, as it mines one of man's darkest moral dilemmas - that of gaining and using another's trust for mostly selfish motivations. Much of the complication comes not only from the acknowledgement of guilt by the perpetrator, but also bythe genuine feelings of concern and empathy that Capote develops for Perry, and he discovers that can't easily reconcile these feelings with his cold and calculated objective.  <br /> <br />The supporting players are exceptional, particularly Keener as Harper Lee and also Bruce Greenwood as author, Jack Dunphy, who was also Capote's partner and lover. But, without diminishing the contributions of all Capote's participants, this is really Hoffman's film. He's an absolute delight. Truman Capote was a complicated, competitive and totally driven man, a literary genius who had many demons, and Hoffman conveys all sides of him to perfection, letting you see the man behind the glasses, the effeminate voice, and the pouting often arrogant humor. Mike Leonard October 05.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a great show, I love the twist and turns of all the complicated lives of surgeons and interns, I know this is fictional but it's almost inspiring to want to be a doctor. Plus the actors are just top notch and very believable. I can't wait for Season 2.

If these guys can make an album that sounds as good as \\"Walking into Clarksdale\\" 25 years down the road then I am standing behind them 100%.  I love you both!

It is wood, not plastic, great colors, easy to assemble and unbelievably sturdy.  The elevator structure is amazing and the boys were thrilled with it.  An absolutely first-rate toy - forget Fisher Price or any of the others.  Am on a search for more PLAN toys!  Worth twice as much as I paid for it if not more!!
B00008OWZC|1.0|Why didn't you just release the complete, unedited, four hour+ LA Forum show, warts 'n all, after giving it a good remastering?  Instead of all the mix-matching in pursuit of some sterile \\"perfection\\" that is the very antithesis of what Zep was all about?<br /><br />Sure, HTWWW is phenomenal, far better than TSRTS(tho No Quarter is sorely missed) or anyone else's live album.  One can only imagine the reactions from the fans who were hearing the HOTH material for the very first time.<br /><br />But I sure feel bad for the people who will never hear the between songs banter, including a lecturing of a security guard; or the Louie, Louie/Everyday People/Thank You medley, for starters.  Just a travesty that medley was left off.<br /><br />But, yes, this is well worth buying just for the blazing performances of Over The Hills, Ocean, RnR, Black Dog, & Dancing Days, which are all far superior to the studio versions.<br /><br />The bootleg is called Burn Like A Candle.  Well worth looking for.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|ZZ Top's Tres Hombres is a classic rock album, perhaps one of the all-time best. I consider it ZZ Top's best album, being the finest representation of their sound and containing their highest-quality material as far as both performances and songwriting are concerned.  Their second album, Rio Grande Mud is almost as good, however Tres Hombres gets an edge because the songs are more instantly memorable and are all high quality. There is not a single weak moment on Tres Hombres. Every cut is top notch. There's quite a bit of variety too, from the mid-tempo blues of Jesus Just Left Chicago to the hard rock of Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers to the Memphis soul of Hot, Blue and Righteous to the John Lee Hooker boogie of La Grange. Even lesser known album cuts like Precious and Grace, Shiek and Master of Sparks are excellent. Forget the compilations, if you're looking for the absolute best of the Little Old Band from Texas, look no further. Tres Hombres is it.  It is an essential album than any fan of blues-oriented rock and roll needs to have. <br /> <br />Finally after many years, the original sound mix is available on CD. This new remastered edition eliminates the horrible 1980s remix which piled on echo and fake drums, completely ruining the raw, bluesy feel of the original album. Finally, that mistake has been corrected to the delight and relief of ZZ Top fans everywhere. It's just too bad that it took over a decade for it to happen. The new CD sounds great and includes very informative liner notes giving background information on the recording of the album, as well as three live bonus tracks.  <br /> <br />Now, as for the bonus tracks. They're great and I'm very glad they were included, but as was the case with Fandango they simply left me wanting more. Any live ZZ Top material is much appreciated as this is one thing sadly lacking from the Top catalog. Until now, the live side of Fandango was the only live representation that the band had (except for a couple of live cuts on the XXX album from 1999). The live tracks on Tres Hombres  are very good. They are obviously not from the era in which the album was recorded. They sound like they were recorded in the '90s or even 2000s perhaps. That's okay, though. It's still ZZ Top live. Waitin' on the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago and La Grange are solid staples of the band's live repertoire and it's great to hear them in concert setting. The only disappointing thing is that there are only three of them. I want much, much more. A whole album of ZZ Top live tracks would be awesome, particularly if it consisted of tracks recorded in the '70s. They're such a great live band, they truly deserve a live album. Hopefully, someday soon Warner will open up the archives and pull out some of those live recordings that are just sitting there gathering dust. <br /> <br />In summary, if you could own only one ZZ Top album, Tres Hombres should be the one. I would also recommend Rio Grande Mud, Fandango, Deguello and Rythmeen. If you're going to buy Tres Hombres make sure that you get the new remastered CD with the original mix restored. Avoid the old one at all costs. Or else just get it on vinyl.
B00005JOE8|4.0|V for Vendetta is a movie which invokes the stifling dominant government of Big Brother in 1984. That the dictator is a figure from one of the best adaptations of 1984 is a nice touch.  <br /> <br />The story revolves around a rebellious figure who strips the thin veneer of populace satisfaction by his actions. The unspoken distrust and dissatisfaction of the government rises almost immediately. The control mechanism (BTN Network) into which the dictators place a lot of stock is shown to be disbelieved by the people watching. <br /> <br />The central tenets, control by the induction of fear, intimidation by official organizations (the fingermen), obfuscation of facts by a government, are well recognized.  <br /> <br />The performances are really quite good. I got a little tired of Natalie Portman's accent. (Does everyone in London have a Cockney accent?), but that is small potatoes as complaints go. A bit dark, and predictably a little unhappy. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00005JOE8|5.0|Well the Brothers did it again.  First we had the Matrix with Neo (One).  <br /> <br />Now we have \\"V\\" and he is telling us we are all ONE. :)  This movie has a lot to do with the mind.  There are many tricks in this movie.  You'll need to watch for them.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this movie.  It was fun to watch.  There is a lot of action, a strong story line and after the movie you get a sense of hope.   <br /> <br />It was moving movie.  I just returned from the show. When it comes on DVD I'll be sure to rent it to see if I can see all the \\"coincidences\\".

Amazing.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and I've reread it many times. This movie is not pure, pure Austen, but it's a nice widescreen version, with beautiful homes for the wealthy and more realistic settings for Elizabeth Bennet's family. Worth it. Just don't expect  the wit and charm of Jane Austen's heroine. It isn't there. K. Knightley is pretty and young, though. McFayden is, for course, for the women to admire.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I guess I'm in the minority among reviewers, but I'll stick with my opinion that this is a travesty of Austen's matchless novel.  (I'd give it no stars if the system allowed.)  Virtually every production detail -- the costumes, the hair styles, the number of people at the balls, failure to show Darcy's attraction to Lizzy from the first, behavior of individual characters (Bingley's entering Jane's room in the night, Lady Catherine's pounding on the door for a night time visit), the ludicrous sculpture gallery at Pemberley etc. etc. -- is wrong.  The abilities of such actors as Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland are wasted by a script that essentially gives them nothing worthwhile to do.  They are reduced to being little more than set decoration.  A single feature film cannot include everything in the novel, of course (the much praised 1995 BBC production left things out, too), but a better script would more truly reflect the original, and none of the production details listed can be explained as necessary because of the limitations of adaptation.  Even the old Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier film, which is pretty bad, is a better adaptation than this one.  If you want \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in video form, get either of the BBC adaptations for a version far closer to what Austen wrote.

B000AP04L0|5.0|This will go down in history as one of the most brutally honestly histerical movies of all time.  I saw this movie back when it was released and it has always resonated as the funniest movie ever, mostly because it pokes fun in the hilarity that is our lives.  There's nothing over the top about this film.  Peter (Ron Livingston) could be you, and you could have his life, and his luck, and thats the greatest part about this movie.  You can relate to the situations that make this film so enjoyable, and yes, hilarious.  Peter works a dead end job at a computerish type company with friends Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Na...Na...\\"Not gonna work here anymore\\" and they all hate it there.  There boss Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is a complete pain in the @$$ and Milton (Stephen Root) is well, weird.  (Actually Milton's subplot involving his employment - or lack there of - and his stapler serve as some of the funniest scenes in this film)  Peter's girlfriend Anne left him and he's trying to hook up with Joanne (Aniston) who is waitress at a local 'bennigans' type resterant.  When they finally get fed up with their situation they decide to take action and come up with a scam to rip off the company.  Hilarity ensues as their plan backfires.  David Herman serves as the funniest person here, with his pure hatred for the singer Michael Bolton and life in general.  Diedrich Bader plays Peter's hilarious hillbilly neighbor.  This is a great film that will supply more laughs than not and should be seen by everyone!
0767810856|5.0|Light-hearted rendition of the true-to-life story of a police officer who was forced by his conscience to share his lottery winnings with a waitress, fulfilling a promise he made when he was otherwise unable to leave a tip. Presents the ways in which sudden prosperity changes people, for the better or worse. A little sappy in order to please the ladies; a little action and a good story so as to please everyone - even us 'macho guys'.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Well, Scary Movie 4 may have a chance, but 2 and 3 did nothing to come close to the hilarity that the first in the series brought (other than the opening scene of 2 where James Woods tries to excersise the hell house...hilarious)  This film is more on the lines of Scream and I Know What you did Last Summer and it has almost the identical plot, but what makes it so funny is that is shows you the stupidity in the overly serious tone these horror films take.  Scary Movie makes fun of the typical Scary Movie, and it works...I mean, look what it has to work with.  Anna Farris is your heroine, and this is her movie...the movie she was meant to star in.  The Waynes brothers are also BIG reasons to watch this film, other than hottie Shannon Elizabeth!  With Marlyn playing the crack adict who gets high with the killer and Shawn playing the sexually confused jock they have the most memerable charactors in the film.  The funniest scene is when they spoof The Blair WItch Project.  Everyone was laughing so loud I had to watch it again by myself to hear what the chic was saying.  With funny scene after funny scene Scary Movie should be at the top of your DVD pile because for some reason it never gets old.
6305511055|5.0|This extraordinarily good movie mixes government intrigue with a normal run-of-the-mill guy, who would have been a computer nerd if the movie had not been set in the mid seventies. Robert Redford is the consummate bookworm, stuck with the rather innocuous job of reading almost everything published in search of hidden word patterns, etc. that operators may have planted in otherwise innocent material, so as to organize covert operations right under the nose of the CIA and the U.S. government. Having submitted a report in which he believes he has found hidden meaning which may jeopardize our way of life, he unwittingly finds himself right in the middle of unimaginable danger, trying to escape from those responsible for the killing of everyone in his office - and being accused by everyone else as being the perpetrator. Top notch development of the story line filled with plot twists and turns, accompanied by excellent acting. Though not overly complicated, viewing the movie a second time greatly enhances the experience due to the intelligent depth of the story. A true masterpiece.

B000AARKW6|5.0|This movie says a lot about the talents of Al Pacino and Sean Penn. It's a movie with a great blend of things: crime drama, love story, and a realistic view on life. There's no played out \\"good guy rides off into the sunset\\" ending. In reality, criminals end up either in prison or murdered. We label them as outcasts, but they're really people just like us, emotions and all. This movie highlights that. A must see if you haven't yet.<br /><br />For the crime movie enthusiast, it's a must see movie as well. If you're the type who's seen all the Godfather movies, Goodfellas, Scarface, etc, then you need to check out this one. A guaranteed classic.
0743487583|5.0|Frankenstein---The word conjures up an image of a gigantic monster out to demolish mankind and everything attributed to it,an ogre created by man bent on dissolving his maker in utter misery. \\"Frankenstein\\" has travelled over the ages to become synonymous with destrution,blood,murder,havoc,fear and everything and anything that's even remotely associated with evil. \\"Frankenstein\\" has become a cliche.<br /><br />And that's exactly where the greatness of the authoress Mary Shelley rests. The plot in the novel is simple enough---a young ardent man steeply soaked in \\"natural philosophy\\" creates a monster with his genius,regrets his doing,asunders it and then suffers the agony of his own architect---but the classic proportions of the tale are vividly accounted in the entwining philosophies,morals,allusions and allegories that it invokes to. It's indeed a wonder that Shelley could've exploited an innovative, simple idea to garb it into a massively broad saga at the tender age of 19,but then again, that's what you call greatness. Take Mozart for inatance. He was composing symphonies and sonatas when he was barely six!<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" begins when a friendless, doughty and resiliently ambitious seafarer Robert Walton saves a strange man from the brink of death amidst a sea of ice whose first words are:\\"Before I come on board your vessel, will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\\" This is Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein and the whole novel revolves around him and the monster he had created. Walton writes to his sister Margaret in England about the fall of Frankenstein from greatness and as the tale unfolds from the man of science's own shivering lips, we've taken on a ride on a wave that flatters to deceives.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein is a young Swiss who leaves his hometown Geneva to pursue natural philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. His knowledge of Cornelius Agrappa, Alberta Magnus and Paracelus pushes him towards a realm beyond the confined boundaries of chemistry and two years of dedication and devotion and Professor M.Walton's \\"words of fate,enounced to destroy\\" him and he reaps a result of magnanimous proportions. He creates \\"the daemon\\", his \\"own vampire, my(his) own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to men\\", a monster whose gigantic stature,ugly features,hoarse voice and crude appearance repugnates its maker and Frankenstein denounces him. And denounces his fortune,career, family,peace of mind and charm of life.<br /><br />For the monster,unbaptized and solitary,comes back again and again to haunt the Swiss. It first kills his youngest brother William,then transfigures into the cause of the doom of the innocent Justine Moritz who's falsely charged with the child's murder;the ogre puts Frankenstein's childhood friend Henry Clerval to death,mortifies his father to his death-bed,destroys the life of his love Elizabeth on their wedding night,allures his creator to death's dwelling and ultimately drags himself to te inevitable end.<br /><br />The plot then is as plain as white paper,as ever so slightly whispered earlier, but that the scope of discussion of characters and events is as extensive as the horizon is illustriously brought to the picture as we explore the landscape of \\"Frankenstein\\". The reader cannot help but sympathise both with the creator and his creation---one repenting his \\"unhllowed arts\\" for being \\"not in deed,but in effect\\" the curse and murderer of one's family,and by extent,mankind;the other willing to harmonise oneself into the fabrication of society when one's physical features are not withstanding. The notion of Frankenstein an ignorant and languid person pets is that of a hideous fiend mustered from animation pictures and cartoons but the essence of it transcends much farther from this simple and debvastating prejudice.<br /><br />The theme of the novel,that of man inviting his own destruction and being chasedby his own myriad forces of vices,is disturbing enough and the sophistication even more muddling. Frankenstein is a distorted harmless young man who realises his blunder when it's too late. A man shadowed by a curse he himself has raised and who loses one beloved after another is always going to transpire confusement and indecision and so does he who actually makes the novel happen. He seeks revenge but knows not how,he is compassionate towards his \\"fiend enemy\\" but refuses to show it. The reader embarks on his queerness not to fulfill his promise and manufacture  female partner for his creation. Frankenstein reasons with himself that two fiends would be one too many for the world to endure and their posterity could aspire to evilry. But was he right to believe what Brutus did of Caesar in William Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\"? That \\"He would be crown'd:/How that might change his nature, there's the question.....Fashion it thus:that what he is,augmenter,/Would run to these and these extremities? That he should kill his own child and \\"sport thus with life\\"?<br /><br />And indeed was Frankenstein's monster as terrible and catastrophic as he deciphered him to be? In the struggle of this fiend to congregate his being with men and their ways,we find an underlying sense of pathos and self-consciouness expressed bluntly and confusedly. At one moment, the colossal beast stoops down to piti and submission:\\"Was I then a monster,a blot upon the earth,from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?\\" On another occasion,he tranmutes into a figure of abhorrence and disastrous:\\"You are my creator, but I am your master;obey\\". This juggling of self-assertion and self-submission makes the giant a confused,complex individual as well as a victim of circumstances since his motives are misconstrued. The cruel end of his strangely pleasant relationship with the cottagers and the rustic soughting \\"to destroy the saviour of his child\\" provide testimonies. The reader discerns his parallel with Shylock in Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",whose tale too is a tragedy of circumstancs, the awkwardness and hardships of a Bohemian surviving on the fringes of human attachment.<br /><br />The similarities between the Creator and the Creation are in abundance and are stark. Both are equally anguished---the Creator rueing His germ of an idea to build anything so splendourly ugly and the Creation questioning his independence and the Creator's need to make him. This is the allegory,or if you will,the theme of of Shelley's darkly eerie narrative. The invokation to the first-person narrative,the plethora of similes and metaphors,the lofty diction and the intricacy of language augment to the authoress's aim to portray the dark shades of life on a more gentle and lighter backdrop. In Frankenstein's pursuit of his monster,the authoress alludes to man's constant hunt of vice in his own self,in the fiend's direct conveyance of his mortal,spiritual and moral wounds,Shelley reveals the hopelessness of the socially deprived;in the end, she hungs upon the wall the conclusion that all such chases ollide with. Herman Melville's classic \\"Moby Dick\\" ran on a similar line and it,like \\"Frankenstein\\",is a tour de force. First publisher in 1818 and set against the era of the eighteenth century, Mary Shelley's intuitive idea dressed in wondrous clothes sparkling with divine metaphysics and resonding portayal of life,truth and futility sustains a powerful impact on us even long after w've closed the book and started chasing our own Frankenstein's monster.disturbing enough and the sophistication even more muddling.

B00009TB5G|5.0|I have seen all three of the Extended DVD Editions of Lord of the Rings, and  I can't help but ask the following questions:    How could a film team in New Zeeland, without prior experience of advanced  film making, be able to create the mastodont Lord of the Rings film trilogy?  How could Peter Jackson, who previously had done low budget splatter films  like Bad Taste and Braindead, pull this off? I am baffled.    How could this massive amount of visual material be created and put together  in such a comparably short time? How could it all be coordinated and  harmonized into such a consistent whole? How could the genuine feeling of  culture and history of a whole world be created in that short time? It  doesn't add up. It's not natural. And it doesn't matter that the film crew  in the extra documentary material on the DVDs tell us how dedicated and hard  they worked; it still doesn't add up. I am telling you, it ain't natural.  There must have been some paranormal or magical forces involved in the  making, or perhaps Tolkien's spirit coordinated the work.    How could they find so many actors that fit so perfectly into the roles, and  acted as if they actually were their role characters and not hired actors?  And all integrated with the visual environments and special effects work.  Incomprehensible. Supermundane forces must have played a part .    I can see some minor weak points in the films, but on the whole they stand  as a world on its own, above the reach of criticism. As with the books my  favorite is The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers feels a little like  transportation (I thought the weakest part here was the Ent. He felt  unconvincing and childish with his too obvious human characteristics and  expressions, like an illustration from a children's book. And some of  the orcs look a little too caricaturish with their long noses.)  When reading the books I imagine characters and environments a little  differently, more mundane down to earth, with ordinary persons put in  extraordinary situations, so that there becomes a strong contrast. For  example, the Shire countryside being mellow in tone, to contrast more with  the magic glimmering of the Elven world. In the film, all the main  characters glow with charisma, and everything is really intense, from colors  to acting. But that is alright. It is still very well done. And there is no  definite way, because everyone who reads the books has his or her personal  vision.  The Return of the King has grown upon me, and it is just as great as the  first film, but in a different way; it has grand beauty within the context  of war. Oooh, and that green dress Arwen is wearing at the wedding! A color  from beyond this world!    The Extended Editions have many great scenes added, especially in The Return  of the King. Who can forget the episode with Gandalf and Pipin atop Minas  Tirith, by the white tree, talking of days gone past? Or the Mouth of  Sauron!?    The extra material is very generous. Sometimes a little too generous,  because every magic trick is revealed.  But if you are yourself an artist,  or work with film, it is indispensible information, and very enjoyable to  watch.  Those involved in the films also tell us how difficult it was to break up  when it was all over. I can imagine the making of these films was a burnout  for some, difficult to top off. To them I can say that, the cosmos is  limitless, and there is always some new beauty around the corner.
B0001I561E|5.0|Having never before seen this movie, the DVD experience was a first viewing for me. I was particularly pleased with the Disney sound. Disney has done a good job with both the sound and picture. The movie is simply an enjoyable experience for adults as well as children. If one has the advantage of full surround sound, the Disney sound is enveloping in the home theater environment.
B000BTJDG2|4.0|This isn't your typical horror film, so I guess I can't really compare it to real horror films. Gore is almost nonexistent, half the movie takes place inside a courtroom (just when you're getting creeped out things go back to the courtroom, keeping the intensity of the movie at a lower level), and the suspense is minimal at times. However, this movie is inspired by true events (\\"inspired by a true story\\" means lessly based on fact than if it said \\"based on a true story\\"), which makes it twice as scary right from the beginning.<br /><br />At the end of movies like \\"The Darkness\\" (don't see that it is worthles), the few people who are actually scared comfort themselves by saying over and over again in their heads, it isn't real, it's just a story. This movie though, focuses on real events. Throughout history, some people have been thought to have been possessed by demons. Though most of the time there is another logical explanation (and we all want to believe there will be a logical explanation), sometimes there is only one way to describe something: there is some supernatural power involved. Now before I start to sound like a wacko, let me finish the review.<br /><br />This film starts out at a creepy fog covered country house and field. The \\"possessed\\" girl, Emily, is dead, and Father Moore, who had attempted numerous exorcisms, is to blame. A hot shot lawyer takes his case and defends him in court. As the trial goes on, the lawyer begins to experience sleepless nights and strange happenings late at night. Father Moore attempts to warn her about supernatural happenings, but since she is an atheist, she takes no heed to his warnings. Father Moore is being haunted by what he believes is the demon that possessed Emily. Throughout the movie, Emily's story is revealed in the courtroom, piece by piece, keeping audiences interested. At the end of the movie, things are resolved, but only partially. Of course there is no way to actually prove Emily was possessed by demons, though it makes for a great story.<br /><br />What makes this movie scary is that, once again I will say this, it was inspired by true events. Another thing that made it scary was that it happened to a normal girl, no different from any other person. This doesn't come close to being the most horrific movie I have ever seen, but some parts are fairly intense, and it definitley kept my interest, something other horror films have repeatedly failed to do.<br /><br />Overall, 4/5 scary rating, 3/5 intensity rating, 4/5 believability rating, 3/5 suspense rating, 4/5 stars for keeping my interest, overall 4/5 starss, though it makes for a great story. <br /> <br />What makes this movie scary is that, once again I will say this, it was inspired by true events.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is the music from a wonderful PBS program \\"Celtic Woman\\".  I love the music that these ladies perform.  I bought two CD's and sent one to my Texas son. We both love Celtic music and this is becoming one of our favorites.  I hope they record more of this great stuff.
B000301YY8|5.0|I think I was fascinated by this artist's work when I first heard his voice.  It is very unusual.  You would hardly expect such a voice to come out of someone who looks like him.  What sets James Blunt apart from other cookie cutter singer-songwriters is that certain something.  That je ne sais quoi that makes you not just hear a song, but hear the man behind it.  This is one of those rare gems. <br /> <br />James Blunt takes the simpliest of all things and gives it wings.  How many have writen songs about lost love?  But we feel his pain, we get it.  I wonder if the gal he wrote it about knows.  She's probably annoyed with herself, boy did she miss the boat!  His personal experiences of being in the British army give us insights into James Blunt the man.  What is so wonderful is that he can take it all and make it fantastic with that voice, that guitar sound, and simple things.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|I just discovered that Badlands had a third album! I saw Ozzy at Ft. Bragg, NC back in 1986 with Jake E. Lee on guitar.  Since then, I've been aware of Jake's path in life. I saw Badlands in Chicago in 1991.  They, to me, are the ultimate merge of blues and rock (metal).  Coverdale/Page come in second. Jake comes from metal, but understands the blues.  This means a lot because, \\"The blues had a baby and they called that baby, Rock 'n' Roll.\\"  The blues is subtle. If you notice Jake doesn't go crazy.  He uses his guitar power sparingly.  But, he hits you between the eyes with guitar electricity if you wait a while.  Check out the Cult tribute, \\"Fire woman.\\"  Jake does \\"American Horse.\\"  Enough about Jake.  Ray Gillen is gone.  Let's appreciate him.  Listen to Jake's new CD \\"Retraced\\" and compare the vocalist to Gillen.  Need I say more?  Ray can match any stud guitarist, anyday. I love Ray's \\"Yeaaaah, yeah!\\" If you are another guy in the 80's, like me,  who discovered \\"Badlands\\" and thought there must be some mistake, then get their final album.  It's better than the first two.  BUYER BEWARE, if you get the Z-Records version, you won't be able to read the lyrics on the CD booklet.  Might as well splurge for the Japanese version instead.
B000E41MS6|4.0|First off, I have not seen the DVD.  I was fortunate enough to catch the series on Canadian TV.  <br /> <br />Being a major Doctor Who fan, I was afraid an update would either be too silly for this era or way too serious.  Somehow the BBC has managed to get the mix correct.  It is not the Doctor of the 60's.  It is a Doctor for the 21st Century.  They have their little cheesy nods to the early doctor, but give us Doctor fans a fantastic update to a fantastic character.   <br /> <br />Christopher Eccleston makes a great Doctor.  While he gives his own take on the Doctor, there are times when he flashes his big smile so suddenly, that I am reminded of Tom Baker's Doctor.  But his quick temper reminds me of William Hartnell's Doctor.  Make no mistake, this is Christopher's Doctor, and what a debut he made. <br /> <br />It's all here.  The Tardis, the humor (or is that humour?), the adventure and a few surprises.   <br /> <br />They touch on subjects that would have been avoided by any previous Doctor.   <br /> <br />Maybe that's what upset other veiwers.  The short lived companion of Cap'n Jack is perfect for the 21st Century.  And maybe it's because of who he \\"dances\\" with that causes people to say this series doesn't compare to others. <br /> <br />I can hardly wait to see the series on DVD in proper widescreen to fill my TV set.  <br /> <br />The only problem I see, so far, with the DVD set, is it's price.  But they know we, well me anyway, will pay to have this in a perfect widescreen and 5.1 audio.   <br /> <br />I believe if you are a Doctor fan, you will truly enjoy this latest version.  Because it is the Doctor, it is not a revisioning.  It IS the Doctor.  Enjoy the ride.

0743529030|3.0|Positive attitude and positive affirmations.  Step by step instructions and real world examples.  Attitude is everything.  Not bad but nothing special or earth shattering.  No hidden secrets to wealth or happiness, just common sense stuff.  However, I enjoyed it.  The author actually does some of the reading on the audio book.  Good book for the car when you're alone.
0307263118|3.0|This is a well-written book, but it lingers too long on certain details and ideas.  The characters are described in very easy-to-see terms - in other words, they are memorable and easy to visualize - but the plot plods along too slowly at times.  It is taking me a long time to read this book and I am a very fast reader, as it does not compel me to pick it up.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I'm probably the biggest David Gilmour fan I know and I had such high hopes (pardon the pun) for his newest solo album. I'm sorry to say that I was severely let down. Aside from \\"Take a Breath\\" and \\"The Blue\\", this album is no more than mediocre at best. David Gilmour is certainly showing his age now, trying to appeal to people closer to his own age and never truly \\"rocks\\" like he did with \\"Until We Sleep\\", or \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" just to name a few. While his guitar work is truly magnificent on this album, the lyrical effort is a glaring reminder that he should have made ammends with Roger Waters years ago. Gilmour's wife writes the lyrics on this album and once again begs the question \\"how on earth can you call yourself a poet?\\" If you're a hardcore Gilmour fanatic like I am, buy it but don't expect much. If not, stick with \\"About Face\\" or his self-titled album.
B00005JLEJ|4.0|Kagemusha is not a 5 star movie.  It is a big step down from Ran (which is very similar in many aspects, but has a great story) and Seven Samurai (a very different and more comedic, earlier movie by Kurosawa).  Kagemusha has two major problems.   The story is quite simplistic, a big problem with a three hour movie.  Incredible visuals and excellent production quality carry much of the movie; there are a few really great scenes, as can be expected of any Kurosawa movie.  But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4-star territory, and that is the ludicrous final battle.  There's a lot worth remembering in Kagemusha, but the crazy ending, unfortunately, sticks in the mind.      The Criterion edition is of excellent quality.  The transfer and sound quality are first-rate, and the additional material is interesting and well done.  Add-ons cannot make a 4-star movie, even so, into a 5-star experience.  There are many positive aspects to Kagemusha, and any Kurosawa fan will be happy with this DVD set.  But for those new to Kurosawa, I strongly recommend Ran or Seven Samurai instead.

B000001FB6|5.0|is the word for Perfect Strangers, Deep Purple's big reunion album from 1984, with the classic MK2 lineup.<br /><br />It was the perfect reply to Zeppelin's \\"In Through The Outdoor\\" of '79. Perfect Strangers could be one of their best works. If not, it's certainly their most rounded, at least until 2005`s Rapture of the Deep. It's a rock album from start to finish, and really, they never sounded so good together. Anchoring the album are two songs, \\"Knockin' At Your Back Door\\", and the title track. Both are rooted firmly in the Purple hard rock plan. They're extensive, hulking groaners that allow Ritchie Blackmore the freedom to play his guitar. Jon Lord's organ adds the glue that holds the band together, giving us something to pay attention to while there are breaks in the action. The organ is most powerful on \\"Mean Streak\\". It's a throwback to the primitive energy of their olden days. But it's also here that we see exactly what Deep Purple really is: a rhythm band. Bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice keep the whole thing grooving, while Lord's keys and Blackmore's guitar insert accents of zing. Gillian's voice sits atop all this, telling stories of an intoxicated girlfriend. On \\"Hungry Daze\\" we hear influences acquired during the band's time off. Gillian's voice, at times, sounds like his stint with Black Sabbath. Blackmore adds guitar work that reminds me of Rainbow. The next track is \\"Not Responsible\\" Gillian's \\"funk you\\" anthem, where he explains that he'll do anything he wants, and accept no responsibility for his actions. That's rock n roll.<br /><br />Perfect Strangers was a atypical album for Deep Purple. Never had the band sounded so cohesive. Never had they managed such a consistent sound over an entire album. Perhaps that's why they called the album Perfect Strangers. Maybe they were five musicians, so diverse that they were strangers to each other in fact. Infinitely different people, that complimented each other perfectly. A piece of pure magic in my opinion.<br /><br />Highlights: Knockin' At Your Back Door, Under The Gun, Perfect Strangers, Gypsy's Kiss and Wasted Sunsets.<br /><br />NOTE: Be sure you get the Polydor version of this disc and not the 1999 Mercury version re-master, it just seems to breath better in my humble opinion.Highlights: Knockin' At Your Back Door, Under The Gun, Perfect Strangers, Gypsy's Kiss and Wasted Sunsets.

0440237688|4.0|As in other fine, classic books that address the great questions of society, The Giver quickly establishes its necessary mood of impending doom. At bottom line is the question that the great and fatal experiment of Communism asked during the last century, the question asked by the myriad attempts at establishing utopian societies: Can human beings be trained/coerced/tricked/cajoled into behaving themselves? Every generation must face this question and usually discovers the answer only through the agony of trial and error, for the answer it seems, is always, resoundingly, no. Four stars rather than five? As with Nancy Farmer's The House of the Scorpion, I found the book wanted at least some small kind of humor to enliven and soften the heaviness of the plot. There is indeed a place for humor in writing that deals with profound issues as Mark Twain dealt with the questions of racism, freedom, and slavery in Huckleberry Finn. Therein, I think, lies the difference between great literature and simply very fine literature.

0440241588|2.0|John Grisham enters the Political/Spy Thriller genre and brings us Joel Backman, a former Washington power broker who pushed the envelope of greed and now resides in a Federal penitentiary. Basically, Backman led a cabal that attempted to sell extremely sensitive satellite information from a shadowy source. Greed trumped patriotism and a scandal and then prison resulted. Now Backman finds himself pardoned for no apparent reason in the last waning hours of a failed Presidency. The hidden reason by the CIA Director for springing Backman is to set him out in the world and then see who kills him. It is presumed that he either betrayed a foreign country or stole the information. The book then proceeds to Treviso and then Bologna, Italy where Backman is hidden and provided with instructors/handlers to immerse him in the Italian language and culture. This is actually very interesting and the best part of the book.  I learned something about both and learned facts such as never to order a cappuccino after 10 A.M. However, there is really not much of a story after this point. Beckman seems to enjoy his immersion in Italy and meets a possible love interest, but nothing developed between them until perhaps after the ending. I do commend Grisham on being able to restrain his characters from immediately jumping into bed with each other. However, I wonder why would Beckman be given such detailed instruction and handling if he is just being set out for the kill anyway? I acknowledge there are some vague reasons, but nothing earth-shaking or justifying a novel. The ending stretch of The Broker has Backman attempting to escape his handlers, making contact with his family, and working to escape his predicament for some vague future. Unlike any other Grisham novel I found myself bored at the end and impatient for his story to finish. That in itself (besides the above) merits my two star rating. The Broker is not horrible and it does entertain some of the time. However, the complete package is missing and Grisham owes more to his readers.ckage is missing and Grisham owes more to his readers.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|My hubby and I just watched this movie over the weekend and we loved it. Both are big fans of Jack Nicholson and were not disappointed. This was absolutely a feel good movie with lots of humor. Diane Keaton was fantastic. Jack's character suffers a heart attack and is given a second chance at life and love. Diane's character is an uptight playwrite that wears turtlenecks in the summer and has given up ever finding love again when along comes Jack. Its really a fun, laugh your butt off kind of movie.
B00005JOE8|4.0|The question is: Is V for Vendetta a \\"glorified al-Qaeda recruiting video\\"?  After seeing the film, I must answer in the negative.  V for Vendetta is a very controversial, unflinching film.  In fact, I believe the promos called an \\"uncompromising vision of the future.\\"  While it definitely is uncompromising, I don't necessarily see how it is a \\"vision of the future,\\" considering it is based off a graphic novel that was written in the 1980s as a critique of the British government under the leadership of conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  The main dilemma that I had with going to see V for Vendetta was the fact that many liberal doppelgangers have decided to use this film as a platform to basically say that Bush is a Nazi, and this is where America will be if we continue to elect men like him.  In fact, the author of the graphic novel, has actually denounced the film, saying that the filmmakers (Larry and Andy Wachowski) basically changed the meaning of the film, which I took to mean they applied Moore's ideas to the current society we live in.  As I stated in my previous post, I also have a very large problem with films glorifying terrorism.  I must say that after seeing the film, it was much more intelligent and well-intentioned than I ever thought it could, or would, be.<br /><br />Code Name V is a terrorist in Britain in the near, but unspecified, future.  Britain's ruler calls himself the high chancellor, and the world outside of England seems to be in total chaos.  (There is mention of the \\"former United States\\" and civil wars going on everywhere, including the \\"colonies.\\")  I guess I could say that V is a \\"freedom fighter\\" but, as the clich&eacute;d saying goes, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.  Evey (Natalie Portman in a role that is definitely a step up from the Star Wars films) works at BTN, the propaganda TV network of London, and she breaks curfew one night, only to be set upon by some party officials, who are about to assault her before V comes in to save the day.  After rescuing her, V decides to take Evey along with him and give her a front row seat to his act of terrorism.  While Evey is obviously distraught with her government, you can tell that the idea of using violence to bring about change is very unsettling to her.  Evey and V then part ways, only to be reunited when V breaks in to BTN to broadcast a video announcing to all of London that he will return in one year, on the 5th of November, and he asks all willing citizens to stand with him when he stands up to their oppressive government.  V feels obligated to return the favor to Evey after she saves his life, so he takes her back to his home, and tells her she must stay with him for a year, until his work is done.  The film definitely slows down at this point.  Instead of focusing on action and suspense, the meat of the film is mostly dialogue and an investigation into V's past by an inspector (Stephen Rea, in one of his best roles that I can remember).  The story plugs along at a fairly fast-paced rate, but there are a couple of slow points where I found myself wondering where the film was going and how it planned to get there.<br /><br />Most of the films meaning comes from the discussions between V and Evey, in which V's viewpoints and actions are questioned directly by Evey, who calls him a monster.  While the viewer can definitely see where V is coming from, the film does a great job to make us see the actual consequences of V's actions, and asking great questions about the meaning of his actions and if they really do mean anything at all.  When the backstory of the ruling government is revealed, the film becomes less significant because it stops focusing on if V's actions are truly the right thing, and more about getting vengeance on these evil murderers who run the country.  There are a few moments where it seemed like the filmmakers were taking potshots at conservatives.  For example, there is one scene where the story of how the chancellor came into power is being recollected, and the storyteller goes out of his way to say that the chancellor came from \\"the conservative party.\\"  It just frustrates me that Hollywood only goes one way these days.  Art is a great way to put forth questions and say something with meaning, but with Hollywood being taken over by liberal activists, we get nothing but the same old stuff.  I mean, who ever disagreed that fascism was a bad thing?  Nobody, but I think we should also all be able to agree that communism was, and is, a bad thing, but whenever there is an evil dictator, he or she comes from the conservative side of the aisle, and that part frustrated me quite a bit.<br /><br />But on to bigger and better things.  Visually, the film really is a stunning piece of work.  It feels like the Wachowski brothers went back and looked at the original Matrix, and remembered why it was so good, and decided to reapply those dynamics to another film.  The acting in the film is top-notch.  As I already mentioned, Portman and Rea do admirable jobs as their characters.  But Hugo Weaving as V, and John Hurt as Chancellor Sutler really stole the film in my opinion.  Somehow, Weaving makes V into a real person, and that is quite a task given the fact that we cannot see his face throughout the whole film.  Hurt is frightening as the chancellor, and he makes a great villain to root against throughout the entire film.  The scenes where Sutler confronts his advisers on the giant screen are totally amazing, and some of the best scenes of the film.  Even though the film doesn't really have a ton of action, when it does, the action is mind-blowing.  Near the end, when you finally get to see V go on a rampage with his knives, it was one of the coolest scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time.  Everyone knows that I love me some gory violence, and the fight scene did not disappoint.  Maybe the best part of the film was the ending.  Somehow, the filmmakers put every idea that had been put forth throughout the film, and summed it up in a way that the viewer could really take anything that they wanted from the movie when they left the theater.  I can see how some people think this movie glorifies terrorism, but I don't think it does.  I think the movie shows us how societies can get out of control, only to be controlled to easily by those who seek to do them harm.  In fact, near the end (mild spoiler), V even admits that he doesn't necessarily think his way is the right way, and he gives the ultimate choice of the film to Evey to decide on.  I don't think I can classify this film as trying to put forth a single message, because the ideas are just too complicated, but I would recommend that everyone see it, however.  See it not only because it is a good film, but because it also asks questions that we should all, yes, even we evil conservatives, should be asking about ourselves.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers are back in my good graces as filmmakers, but not as political activists.lor came into power is being recollected, and the storyteller goes out of his way to say that the chancellor came from \\"the conservative party.\\"  It just frustrates me that Hollywood only goes one way these days.

B00005MG2Y|1.0|Rascal Flatts is closer to \\"Real\\" Hard or Metal then the likes of Linkin Park or Hawthorn Heights. Honestly take a listen to Linkin Park or Hawthorn Heights granted they have hard driving beats and heavy gutar riffs and some \\"Screaming\\" but the also use alot of Electronica in their music. The fact every song they do has the very same theme as the last \\"No One Understands Me\\" or \\"Lifes not fair\\" and sometimes \\"You did me wrong I hate you\\" these guys have nothing original or socialy conscience to say outside their own little box. They sound less like the origins of Heavy Metal such as \\"AC/DC\\" or \\"Iron Maden\\" or Even \\"Motely crue\\" but more like crying teenagers moaning over rock beats and calling it Heavy Metal. Todys music world is pressed for sucess before the age of 25, without real life expereince to write lyrics and vocal maturity these band fall flat of the true greatness they have the potential to own. Without that \\"Life Experience\\" and \\"Edge\\" this may as well be the next effort of the Backstreet Boys going rock.

B000006TSC|5.0|This is a great CD. It isn't as exerimental as previous Camel albums in terms of creating new sound scapes or innovative melodies. But it is a very pleasing mix of prog rock, pop, jazz and even disco elements. This is so much better than pop music released by Yes in the 80's. Even thought this is a poppy album it has a strong Camel feeling that captures a listener immediately. There are some pearls that make this album essential for any Camel fan. I mean Echoes(Great melody and some jazz influences too), Sleeper(jazziest tune on the album) and Summer ligtning (Very danceable and has a great guitar solo too). <br /> <br />This album is so full of hooks. The rhythm section is tight and the album is very well played. Wing on a prayer almost makes me wanna sing. Breathless has one of the most beatifull melodies I have ever heard and a slow section in the middle separates it from a normal pop love song. I don't understand why so many people hate Down on the farm. I was so happy when I first heard it and this album, because I noticed that this band can change their style and not just make rip offs of past glories. You have to understand two facts. Camel was under pressure to make a hit album and they wanted to evolve and expand their musical influences. In my opinion Camel succeeded and made their most entertaining album ever. <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|You would think that Jane Austen's most famous novel is not in need of another cinematic treatment given the definitive BBC version of a decade ago and the classic 1940 MGM version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, not to mention a contemporary 2004 Bollywood-style musical and according to IMDB, at least six other versions. However, first-time feature director Joe Wright and first-time screenwriter Deborah Moggach (with uncredited assistance from Austen adaptation veteran Emma Thompson) have brought youthful vigor and a wild, Thomas Hardy-like element to the movie, and as a whole, it works very well. It almost makes the overly familiar novel feel revitalized.<br /><br />For those who have forgotten their required high school reading, the story focuses on the downscale Bennet family - a passive father and a domineering mother, the latter intent on marrying off their five daughters to wealthy families. Eldest daughter Jane becomes smitten with rich but somewhat weak-willed Mr. Bingley and the bookish Mary keeps to her piano, while the two youngest daughters, Kitty and Lydia, are giggly and boy-crazy. On the other hand, the headstrong Elizabeth wants marriage on her terms with an intellectual equal, and she becomes alternately repelled and drawn to the brooding Mr. Darcy. There are several plotlines that interweave precariously toward the inevitable conclusion, but Austen's witty, often insightful dialogue holds the story together organically with grace and humor.<br /><br />Twenty-year old Keira Knightley is the youthful embodiment of Elizabeth, as her predecessors, Garson in particular, always strike me as too mature for the role. With her beauty subdued in casual period fashion, she manages to convey all the necessary facets of her personality with a natural &eacute;lan. As Darcy, Matthew Macfayden captures the moody character's insolence and growing romanticism with little affectation. Most all of the supporting players shine with Brenda Blethyn as the exasperating Mrs. Bennet, Donald Sutherland as her introspective husband, Tom Hollander as the priggish Mr. Collins, Rosamund Pike as beautiful and likable Jane, Jena Malone convincingly British as the impulsive Lydia, and of course, in all her scene stealing glory, Judi Dench lends acidic vinegar as Lady Catherine, Darcy's disapproving aunt.<br /><br />Parts of the film have a subtly stylized quality, such as the way the camera seems to track uninterrupted during the Assembly Hall ball sequence or when Elizabeth's head spins symbolically as she sits on a swing. There are also many well-turned tableaux-style shots that imbue the spirit of the period with vivid but unobtrusive detail. Credit should go to Roman Osin's textured and sumptuous cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's authentic-feeling costumes and Dario Marianelli's flavorful music, all of which capture a decidedly realistic though ultimately romanticized 16th-century England.<br /><br />The DVD package has several too-short features that provide some background into the production and Austen's characters but hardly enough to provide meaningful insight. Wright provides sometimes interesting commentary on an alternate track that borders a bit on the effusive, and there is an alternative and thankfully excised ending which spells out the plot resolutions unnecessarily. This movie is a joyous celebration of Austen's artistry as a writer whose story themes resonate today.erating Mrs. Bennet, Donald Sutherland as her introspective husband, Tom Hollander as the priggish Mr. Collins, Rosamund Pike as beautiful and likable Jane, Jena Malone convincingly British as the impulsive Lydia, and of course, in all her scene stealing glory, Judi Dench lends acidic vinegar as Lady Catherine, Darcy's disapproving aunt. <br /> <br />Parts of the film have a subtly stylized quality, such as the way the camera seems to track uninterrupted during the Assembly Hall ball sequence or when Elizabeth's head spins symbolically as she sits on a swing.

B000EOTAM6|2.0|What is it about cloning that makes the Hollywood firmament indulge itself in futuristic narrative claptraps that aspire toward big statements about humanity and our apocalyptic fate? Last summer, big-budget schlockmeister Michael Bay went for the eternal youth angle in his bombastic though periodically thoughtful morass, \\"The Island\\", and now indie filmmaker Karyn Kusama makes cloning the lifeblood of Bregna, a cloistered city ruled by the dictatorial Goodchild family. Based on an MTV animated series from a decade ago, this 2005 film set in 2415 has the sheen of a stylish cartoon but the mindset of a confused pair of screenwriters, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, working off cartoonist Peter Chung's convoluted concepts about the self-destruction of mankind.<br /><br />Sporting an unfortunate Alan Cumming haircut, Charlize Theron plays the title role by showing off impressive athletic prowess and looking svelte in her black cat suit, but she is bereft of personality, at least one that would draw interest to her character's fate. Consequently, she speaks in a blank-faced monotone that seems to drain more energy than the Matrix-like kicks she uses to pummel her adversaries. As a Monican, an underground resistance movement out to eliminate the ruling Goodchilds, Aeon is instructed by the Handler to assassinate the leader, Trevor Goodchild. Yet, in the moment of key confrontation, she cannot do it for reasons that unfold in clunky plot turns that seem to weigh down an already clunky set-up. Any sensibility the story has - which is minimal anyway - is put completely on hold until the revelations come about later.<br /><br />Why actresses of the caliber of Theron, Frances McDormand (no more than a talking head as the Handler) and Sophie Okonedo (so impressive in \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" but simply posturing here as Aeon's colleague Sithandra) are involved in this debacle is the bigger mystery that should be solved. The men fare no better with Marton Csokas saddled with the film's most laborious lines as Trevor and Johnny Lee Miller who seems to be making a career of playing thoroughly obnoxious characters as his power-hungry younger brother Oren. The action set pieces should have saved this movie, but for the most part, they are quite dull and ridiculous and what's worse, edited badly, in particular, the first acrobatic display of Aeon and Sithandra as they attempt to gain entry into the Goodchild enclave.<br /><br />As the mind-numbing jumble of a story unwraps the mysteries behind the relationship between Aeon and Trevor, it doesn't provide enlightenment as much as it softens an already weak storyline with a romance novel angle. I think the filmmakers had good intentions in showing another variation of a post-apocalyptic world, but even with the slight twist toward the end and Aeon's consequent humanization, there isn't an element in the film that feels fresh.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|This movie focuses on the gentle longing over decades between Cash and June Carter, as Cash becomes the man he was meant to be, and then a junkie, and back again.  Joaquin Phoenix convincingly shows the intense desire for Carter that Cash feels, though he must mask his emotions over many years and each other's marriages.   <br /> <br />The portrayal of his childhood scars is simplistic, but as one angle on a complex life, the film succeeds as a romantic biopic.  One feels the true story of Cash's life, is both less thrilling and less mundane at the same time.   <br /> <br />Often genuinely thrilling (Folsom performance), Phoenix et al received well deserved attention for superb performances all around.
B00005JOWF|1.0|Remember when we were kids? All those days spent playing with our toys, letting our imaginations run wild, all the while never once caring about following a plot or storyline. Batman, Luke Skywalker, and GI Joe could really do some unbelievable things when backed with a child's imagination. So take that idea, create a hour-and-a-half movie out of it and call it Ultraviolet.  <br /> <br />Ultraviolet is her own set of action figures, complete with color-change hair, color-change clothes, weapons that appear out of nowhere and an indestructible motorcycle that can drive up the sides of buildings.  <br /> <br />You know you're in trouble when the plot and history of the movie is laid out for you in the first five minutes, then it's off to digital overkill. You become so bombarded with over-the-top digital effects, unbelievable stunts, and an incredibly lame plot that by the time you leave the theater you're not exactly sure how to feel. Is this a comic book movie, a big-budget Saturday morning cartoon, or a bargain bin video game?  <br /> <br />This movie could appeal to an 8-12 year old audience, but it's a little too violent for that age group. A really lame effort by Kurt, who I actually like, but may never forgive for this MTV video-gone wrong.
B000E97X66|5.0|In 1975, the weight of the world was on young Bruce Springsteen's shoulders when he and the E Street Band headed for London for the very first time. Constant touring and rave reviews hadn't translated into record sales and his label, which had taken a gamble on him when they signed him in the first place, was about to dump him. Worse, every night he had to face skeptical crowds who wanted to see why critics kept calling this young ruffian from New Jersey \\"the future of rock and roll.\\" Such was the case in 1975 when they walked out on the stage at the Hammersmith Odeon. <br /> <br />With everything on the line, Bruce and the boys played like they had nothing to lose. They were lean, young, and hungry. They played with heart. They played with passion. They played with urgency. And, on this night, they were untouchable. This CD captures that show in its entirety (a DVD of the show is included in the 30th Anniversary box set of Born To Run). <br /> <br />Few bands can match the versatility that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band display here. Witness the opening tender, wide-eyed rendition of \\"Thunder Road\\" followed by a feisty, swaggering version of \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.\\" Or \\"She's The One\\" which goes from a slow simmer to a full boil in a mere five minutes. Or \\"Born To Run,\\" which Bruce plays with all of the blue-collar grit and youthful defiance that would later make the song a classic. Or how 'bout the \\"Detroit Medley,\\" in which the band absolutely ROARS through Mitch Ryder's \\"Devil With A Blue Dress On,\\" \\"Good Golly Miss Molly,\\" and \\"Jenny Take a Ride\\"? He follows THAT with a heartbreaking reading of \\"For You\\" before revving things up again, ramrodding through a rollicking version of Gary U.S. Bonds' \\"Quarter To Three.\\" Are you KIDDING me? <br /> <br />I didn't even mention the absolute insanity of the 17+ minute version of \\"Kitty's Back,\\" in which Bruce and the guys go out of their freaking minds, did I? Heck, I didn't even mention \\"Jungleland,\\" my favorite song in the entire Springsteen catalog. No, I didn't mention most of the songs here, because I want you to experience this show for yourself. PLEASE -- do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CD NOW! You won't regret it, I promise. <br /> <br />(By the way, some other reviewers were wondering about the absence of \\"Pretty Flamingo\\" from this CD. This show is from November 18, 1975 -- their first show in London. They played a second show at Hammersmith Odeon on November 24, 1975 and THAT was the show that contained \\"Pretty Flamingo.\\" By most accounts, the second show was even better than the first, if you can imagine that, as Bruce performed 22 songs in nearly three hours.)

6305428352|5.0|The blas&eacute; will say that this is one more film on the life and retirement of a good teacher. One more and nothing else. They would be slightly wrong. This film is a lot more interesting and profound than that. First of all it becomes personal and poignant when his own son is discovered to be 90% deaf at birth. For a musician and music teacher tbis is a tragic blow, even if Beethoven became deaf in his life. Then it shows that a good teacher is not supposed to caress the students in the smooth way of things, but he has to be both exacting and demanding on one side and on the other side helpful in the effort the students have to do to eventually come to the pleasure of becoming able to play beautiful music. And it takes a tremendous effort on the teacher's part to be that inspiring and ruthless guide who will teach rhythm and drumplaying to a black man who will die in Vietnam, sentiment and clarinet playing to the only daughter of a family who has no creative dimension, emotion and how to sing with her heart to a girl who would like to take her music teacher along with her to New York. But furthermore the film is also a vast trip from the sixties to the nineties, from Kennedy to - the unnamed - Clinton, with the Vietnam war at the back, Hair, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Nixon resigning, Ford falling when walking down from a plane, Reagan and his famous Hollywood smile, and of course the severe cuts in education in the mid-nineties that led to dropping all artistic activities from the curriculum of the school. And we could go on and on with levels of meaning that avoid mish-mash sentimentalism. And yet the end is kind of too much. How can we imagine the school, the principal and the whole community who have rejected the man at sixty without more ado than for an insignificant incident come together to unanimously present him with a farewell present that should have asked months of secret preparation ? And that present means that this Mr Holland has sacrificed all his personal and musical potential for the sake of teaching music to kids, including his composing and his musical inspiration. This leads to the saddest fact of all : education is based on a frustrating d&eacute;dication from the teachers. A dedication that verges onto sacrifice, of one's own life and of one's family's life, and a frustration that stifles in the teacher what is his deepest and most insanely creative inspiration, which delivers him to retirement a hollow shell with an uncatchable ghost of a dead ambition. This film is thus very painful : as long as our school system will demand such sacrifices from its teachers it will lead to a deeply boring and frustrating education that will leave young people naked and unarmed in front of life when the real hardships of history come, and they always come back over and over again.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonneall his personal and musical potential for the sake of teaching music to kids, including his composing and his musical inspiration.

This film is thus very painful : as long as our school system will demand such sacrifices from its teachers it will lead to a deeply boring and frustrating education that will leave young people naked and unarmed in front of life when the real hardships of history come, and they always come back over and over again. <br /> <br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit Paris Dauphine, Universit Paris I Panthon Sorbonne <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Annie Proulx did something other's thought was impossible when she sat down and wrote the Spartanly written, yet beautifully haunting and heartbreaking short story Brokeback Mountain; she reinvented the American Cowboy.  She gave that distinctly American icon a whole knew sensibility and dimension here to date unheard of or at least not talked about out in the open.  Some have venerated her for it, while others have called what she wrote and act of blasphemy.  However you want to approach it, one cannot dismiss it. <br /> <br />The same year it came out in the New Yorker (1997) Diana Ossana read it and brought it to the attention of her writing partner the venerable Larry McMurtry the writer of an epic novel about the friendship of two men and the lengths each man would go for the other in the remarkable Lonesome Dove.  Together Diana and Larry wrote the screenplay that because the foundation for the film Brokeback Mountain.  They shopped this screenplay around for years with people telling them it was a great script with heart and pathos and yet ultimately couldn't be made in Hollywood because of it's subject matter. <br /> <br />That is until 2004, when Focus came into the picture and decided to take a chance, even in today political climate.  And with Ang Lee the director of the Ice Strom and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon directing what could go wrong?  In the leads he cast up and coming stars Heath Ledger as the brooding, repressed Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as the open and optimistic Jack Twist. <br /> <br />Many have stated that this is a grand or epic love story.  Which while being the truth isn't the whole story.  It's more complicated than that.  It speaks in a small still voice to what happens when people are told who they love, how they love and how they want to live is wrong.  It's about the cause and effect that social morays can have not just generally but specifically.  And while Brokeback Mountain isn't a political film with a political agendait does however speak to the political atmosphere both of the time it's set in and unfortunately of today as well; because for all that has change, more has stayed the same.   <br /> <br />This film isn't for everyone, the subject matter may be hard for some to digest, and impossible for others.  It may shatter the illusions some have of the west and or what some consider the Cowboy influence on our culture.  The truth of the matter is, as much as some don't like it, it's also part of who we are.  Gay, straight, or other, Brokeback Mountain, touches on something we can all understand and empathize with - the human condition - the human heart - the need to be loved - the need for human contact.  It speaks to the human heart and its capacity for love - hate and the repressing burden of self loathing.  It speaks to what can happen when what we need is starkly contrasted by what society says we can have.    <br />

B000E1155E|3.0|This band is good, don't get me wrong, and the cd is worth listening to. Dancing Shoes, track 4, is entertaining, as well as Riot Van, track 7.  However, there are other artists doing the same thing, often even better. The Subways' Young for Eternity is very similiar but in my opinion their vocals are more interesting, and their hooks more catchy. Also Franz Ferdinand's You Could Have It So Much Better.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|When I first watched this movie, I sat there and wondered 'what the hell is this all about?'. I sat there and wondered if the cast was on acid. <br /> <br />Then I went away, and for the oddest of reasons, it kept on coming back into my mind. So I bought the DVD and watched it again.  <br /> <br />It's one of those movies that the more you watch, the more enjoyable it becomes and the more you can appreciate it.  <br /> <br />There is a plot of which to speak of, though it's stock standard and waterthin, but the plot is incidental to the music, dancing and pacing.  <br /> <br />It certainly goes down in my top 10 favourite movies.
0385720920|2.0|The one thing you'll do as you read Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Choke\\" is literaly choke. Amidst the sex-aholic addicts, demented patients, colonial characterization of 18th century America and the sporadic jumps to the past for a glimpse of an abusive childhood, time and time again you'll choke and choke and choke.<br /><br />You'll choke when you read about the strange idiot who thought he was the resurrected Christ and went about chocking on food in restaurants so that innocent folks could save him and from whom later he could extort money. You'll choke when you read about the demented mother who kidnapped a child and proceeded to make its life a living hell, while she committed crime after crime. You'll choke when you read about the strange compulsive freak who rather than taking control of his life proceeded to collect hundreds of rocks from the streets and bring them to his home and then store them in his bathroom, in his stove, in his refrigerator. You'll nearly vomit at the numerous disgusting descriptions of sexual intercourses, degrading acts of perversion and rape. I did. I should've dropped this book and instead picked up another, watched some TV, gone shopping or something else. But the one thing that'll really make you sick is the sorry excuse for a narrative, this `let me start a sentence for the sake of stating it, write a bit of gibberish for the sake of writing and end it without convening anything but the idea that this is a sentence with a noun, adjective and a verb' foul and pathetic excuse for a book.<br /><br />I now hate the 4 wasted hours on trying to get into the author's mind, because I'm literaly convinced that the author is mentally sick.<br /><br />Listen to my advice, yield to reason, DO NOT contaminate your mind with disgusting knowledge of middle age, bold characters with sticky fingers, empty hearts and compulsive and severely questionable mental states.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Long before there was Cirque Du Soleil, there was that amazing French guy twirling crytstal balls across his hands like water, unable to see what he was doing with his arm poked through the back of David Bowie's costume. How many billard balls did you fling across a room trying to emulate that trick? <br /> <br /> <br />When it comes to fantasy entertainment, very few films can match Labyrith for tour de force imagination. Frank Oz (The Muppets) seemed inspired by Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits) when envisioning this dark yet whimsical fantasy about a teenage girl's metaphorical coming of age. Images from the film still linger in my dreams today, especially the haunting waltz sequence with David's spellbinding song \\"As The World Falls Down\\". Add to that the eyestalks on the mold, the true/false doors (I still struggle with the logic on that one), the junk lady (very Gilliam) and the final Escher sequence, it makes for one of the most incredibly imagined films of our time.
0792163710|5.0|I remember this movie from when I was very young and me and my mama watched it. A very good movie...
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|<br />The first five songs are an excellent quality of music.  After that is just sounds like songs that were thrown together at the last minute; probably the music label rushing the album.  Its sick the way money pollutes art in this manner.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|I'm giving the DVD itself 4 stars, the movie is obviously a 5 star, the picture and sound is great, a bit dissapointed with the extras though, this is labeled a \\"special edition\\", and you get like...3 extras. but the movie itself is classic Scorsese. Here we have Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci working together again (Goodfellas), also, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles and James Woods adds nice performances as well, all the actors are good in this, even if it's only a small part.  <br /> <br />The movie is about mid-west mob bosses, having people slipped inside a casino, and scamming the casino, but after a while, the cash bags get lighter and lighter, the mob bosses get unhappy, and you know what happens when they get unhappy, all hell breaks loose.  <br /> <br />Lots of violence, lots of language, great acting, great story, and you get this great movie. Indeed, it is long, but well worth watching, same with The Godfather 1&2, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Goodfellas and many more.  <br /> <br />\\"Paradise, we reaaaally managed to f*ck it all up\\"
B00005ASOC|3.0|it seems like half of the real movie was left on the cutting room floor. there are so many storylines that aren't fully developed, like jamal's relationships with his male peers, jamal's relationship with his love interest, the professor's jealousy with william, etc. that it's disappointing. as a result, it is like watching a half-hearted attempt to be meaningful.
0805079076|3.0|A couple of days ago I finished reading 'The Unfolding of Language : An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention' by Guy Deutscher. Wow, it's exhausting just to say the name, imagine what it felt like to read the book. But, seriously the work is intellectually challenging and often provoked me to engage in thoughts on the ever changing state of human language. And yes, metaphors are the erodent of language (in case you were wondering). Many times I found myself reminiscing about the complexity of the ancestral expressions. By the way, anyone who thinks modern language is more intricate than say Latin or ancient Babylonian needs to pick up this book. Mr. Deutscher's analysis seemed logical enough to make me a believer that dead languages were a lot more eloquent than modern ones. But this is where interesting stops and tedious begins. I felt this book was geared toward students in linguistics as oppose to the average reader (my apologies to the author, but I'm a graduate in business). At times it seemed Mr. Deutscher couldn't make up his mind on what to include in the actual body of the book and what to leave in the Appendixes (and trust me, there is a lot that should've been left in the Appendixes). For example, consonances and grammatical rules of African languages did little to entice my eagerness to immerse myself in the constructs of language. Often I had to go back and reread some pages forcing myself to ascertain their usefulness and applicability in my daily life (unsuccessfully, if I may add). I expected the 'evolutionary tour' to include historical aspects of the human evolution, but...oh well. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this book. Instead, for those readers interested in introductory material into the evolution of language (masterfully coupled with historical analysis) I recommend Genes, Peoples, and Languages by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza.<br /><br />- by Simon Cleveland
B00005JO9J|5.0|Definitely worth the money. I can't wait for every Sunday to see what happens next! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I grabbed this on sale at my local media store and really didn't know what to expect.  I had heard bits and pieces of the real myth/story but had no idea of the details and all that stuff.  Maybe this is why I liked it better than some of the reviewers that hated it because of the \\"not true to the books / original story\\" crowd. <br /> <br />I thought the acting was excellent although Brad Pitt seemed out of place sometimes.  He just isn't a rough and tough dude like Achilles must have been.  Otherwise, the characters were cast almost perfectly.   <br /> <br />The unfolding story had some interesting twists and turns that kept me involved and waiting for the next situation to occur.  I enjoyed the back and forth nature of the battles and strategies, especially the ending when Troy finally gets sacked.  VERY cool stuff. <br /> <br />The battle scenes were as well done as you could possibly do them with great choreography, violence to show the bloodiness of war, and also the magnitude of it all.  The huge number of boats in the sea on their way to Troy was a breathtaking shot. So are the shots of the huge armies just waiting to go at it. <br /> <br />Overall, this film came out pretty well, not perfect, but very much worth seeing.  The DVD quality and the sound quality are as good as you can get! <br /> <br />The flaws are as follows: <br /> <br />- Brad Pitt tried to play Achilles the best he could but just seemed out of place and was probably miscast here. <br /> <br />- The movie/plot deviated quite a bit from the actual events/legend/myths.  I have no problem with this though, it was an entertaining movie not a history lesson.  Still, they could have stayed true to the \\"Iliad\\". <br /> <br />- The extra features on the second disc are pretty weak and not very good. <br /> <br />If you can get it at a sale price, I'd buy it.  It's worth watching a few times and this alone justifies purchase since rentals are pretty costly anyways. <br /> <br />SOLIDLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|If you are a fan of death metal, you won't like this CD(as panned by an earlier reviewer).  And perhaps many others will not like this either, but it is an outstanding recording.  Perhaps my biggest complaint is that it is very difficult to choose favorite tracks.  Each song tends to meld into one another but by no means is there a sameness to the sounds.  It is not a recording that you can easily program a few tracks to listen to.  It is new-folk music so if that is not your cup-of-tea, avoid.  The titles are entertaining.
B000002GIE|4.0|In the late 80's and early 90's it was about how in your face you can get with your sound. Nobody was better at this art form then Extreme and this is where they started.  <br /> <br />What I mean about \\"in your face\\" is not about speed, not about heavy and not about how popular you can get. It is about putting emphasis on every instrument including the vocals while still making the song melodic. Extreme did this, well to the Extreme.  <br /> <br />What I find is a shame is that thier biggest hit and probably the only song Extreme will be remembered by is the Mega-hit \\"More Than Words\\" When it comes to music, does it really matter what the general public thinks. If you thought like them, you wouldn't even consider buying this CD no less be reading this review.  <br /> <br />As for the record itself... read on <br />Even though this is probably the bands 3rd best recording, it still has a few stand out tracks. Mutha (Don't Wanna go to School Today) is a true 80's rock Anthem. Wind Me Up is filled with killer licks and overthe top vocal production. Play With Me shows off Nuno's A1 guitar skills. Not every track is top notch though(there are some weaker songs toward the end of the disc) <br /> <br />Overall this is one of the better releases from the late 80's hard rock genre. Ignore all who say Extreme was just a one hit wonder with a ballad and see for yourself.
B000023VR6|5.0|When this album released right before Y2K, nobody had heard the sound before. The beats on this album are probably the best instrumentals ever released on a rap record. After this everybody in the game wanted a piece of the cake. Everybody wanted Dre on their record. <br />This album is revolutionary due to the fact, that no one had heard this type of stuff before. <br /> <br />And it features the whole Westcoast on the record, Snoop were back and Eminem had begun blossom. If you're a rap fan and still doesn't got this in your collection for some strange reason, be sure to pick it up, it will be worth every buck. <br /> <br />Best songs on this album are: The Watcher, F'''  You, Still D.R.E., Xxplosive, What's the Difference, Forgot About Dre, The Next Episode, Murder Ink, Housewife and Bang Bang. <br /> <br />That's about half of the songs, and all these songs are basically classics. You don't get that nowadays. While Chronic 2001 isn't the legendary The Chronic, it's still the revolutionary album that mainstream beats nowadays are based on. <br /> <br />Last but not least, Dre... It's been 7 years, which means it's time for Detox. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading. <br />RapSuperstar    <br />

B000059TEP|5.0|Isn't love grand?  Patrick and Demi and bowl of clay have never been hotter.  Demi Moore has to be the best crier in cinematic history.  Has anyone ever looked so beautiful crying?  I doubt it.  Whoopi Goldberg deserved her oscar and I still don't see why she had to give the money away, seeing how the bad guys came after her anyway...but at least true love conquered all.  To tell you the truth, I'm surprised that Hollywood didn't try to capitize on the popularity of her character and write another story of the sometimes hack and sometimes genuine medium.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Quirky, stylish, and dark are IMHO the best three words to describe the third and most eccentric entry into the Harry Potter series.  This movie is dripping with atmosphere and brimming with so many details and effects, it warrants repeated viewing.  Every time I re-watch this, I see something new that I missed the previous time. <br /> <br />It's easy to tell right from the beginning that the director is not a mainstream kinda filmmaker, as his style is almost art-house.  Normally I'm not much of a fan of 'style-over-substance' in movies -- and I'm not saying that this movie lacks substance... but let me put it this way; The visuals are such eye-candy that if I could afford to, I'd build a picture frame around a plasma TV, mount it on my wall, and play this movie on infinite repeat 24 hours a day with the volume muted.  (Hey, who says wall art has to be static?  Just ask some of the paintings in Hogworts!) :-) <br /> <br />Not that the movie is in any way bad with the volume up... on the contrary, the quirky fun caries over into the dialogue as well.  But in some ways this is wasted on a Harry Potter movie.  It's almost as though they've laboured to make a work of art whose target viewing audience will never appreciate it.   <br /> <br />Some of my friends thought that the quirkiness was 'inappropriate' for a Harry Potter movie, and it didn't fit with their expecations.  On one hand I can see where they're coming from, but at the same time I didn't really have to open my mind *that* much to appreciate it for what it was.  I mean, if you can ignore that it's in a completely different mold than the earlier 2 movies in the series and think of this as a brand new experience, it's easier to accept it on its own terms. <br /> <br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, was that I agree with the people who thought that they went a little overboard taking artistic license with the story.  There were plot elements that were changed for seemingly no reason, and parts that were removed for \\"time\\" when they could have easily been fit in by chopping some unnecessary added sequences which didn't serve any greater purpose in the story. (The shrunken head scene for example, went on far too long).

B0000DIXDR|4.0|Time is cruel.  My mother warned me but alas.  It seems like yesterday when Patrick Swayze ruled the world and parents had a fit about the 'dirty' dancing in this movie.  Boy, does this stuff look tame now.  This film along with its monstrous successful soundtrack seem like it would rule for eternity.  The love story between Johnny and Baby could not be denied.  and oh my gosh, they even took on the still much hot topic of abortion.  It's good dancing, a forbidden love story, and about a woman coming of age.  Did Johnny and Baby go one to live happily ever after-probably not...but boy, they had the time of their lives that one HOT summer.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My only complaint is that there was not a full season of episodes but I'll take the 14 I can get. Joss Whedon's brilliant witty writing shines through again. I will forever wonder what happens to the crew of Serenity on their continued journey. The casting was great as per usual for a Joss show and the ensemble worked together to create an engrossing show that kept you wanting more. I loved it and you will too. Whether it was the foray into Chinese dialogue, the unresolved sexual tension between Captain Reynolds and Inara, the laugh out loud moments of comedy, the special effects, or the internal struggle between doing what's right or apathy, this show is first rate.

B000E5N62U|4.0|It's hard to put into words exactly what it is that Becker does to alter the chemistry enough to make something Fagan creates SD. Maybe it's the punch songs have or the crisp endings or something slyly more sardonic in the lyrics. But you can tell a solo shot versus a collaboration from across a smokey noise filled bar at the end of the world in a heartbeat. The way it seems to work is that Fagan will deliver another solo CD after this while Becker produces for whoever will be next year's Rickie Lee Jones, and then prehaps release a solo CD, then in a couple of years a new Steely CD will emerge that will remind you how terrific that partnership is, and then it will be followed closely by left over songs culled into a less than satisfying follow up, and then, who knows, one hasa  heart attack, there's a big funeral in NY and people like Ben Harper start releasing SD tributes. <br />In the meantime, MORPH has arrived, and while it is less GAUCHO and KAMAKIRIAD (wasn't that a Boy George song?), it isn't as devastatingly stark and emotional as anything from Pretzel Logic through AJA. Still it seems like a cat trying to swim to those shores and for that alone it is a welcome addition to Fagan's canon. Much has been made of this being Fagan's come uppance with the grim reaper, and I scratch my head: hasn't that always been at the core of Fagan's tales: Fate's about to bite your winkie off, any last thoughts? <br />What I miss are the crisp and surprising endings Becker seems to have wrought out of these Doc Pomus meets Charles Bukowski epics. Fagan has been asking the dust and detritus of the American Dream what it's like being spit on for years now, and like the aforementioned poet has had an uncanny ability to find both revulsion and redemption in their tales. That is still the strongest suit in this collection of songs. There is no escaping the notion that the end of the world as you know it can be see from where you stand, and Fagan finds hope paradoxically even in the despair, as though asking if we don't give up, how can we ever hope? <br />\\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" may sum it up best, but each song on this release is worth careful consideration. The arrangements are what you'd expect from Fagan - all NY r & b, coupled with a world weary sensibility and a NY sarcasm. Fagan's voice is more reedy and nasal, but that comes with age, and an approaching sense that inspite of your sneer, the end is near. <br />Well worth picking up, if only for the way it points back to AJA and what might still come forward in a few years, after a few projects, God willing. From these lips to some mother's ears...
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab for Cutie rates as one of my favorite bands, and Benjamin Gibbard as one of the most talented lyricists and musicians today.  My favorite CD ever is Give Up by the Postal Service.  Plans is like a candy for your ears: sweet and leaves you wanting to have more of it.  I have listened to this Cd so many times, I actually burned it out, and had to buy a new copy.  Every single track is excellent.  Marching Bands of Manhattan is an excellent opener, and I love the imagery that is evoked by this song.  Soul Meets Body is another excellent song.  I Will Follow You Into the Dark left me speechless. I was so moved by the sparse, acoustic sound and the lyrics that punched you in the gut.  After listening to that song, I thought that this CD couldn't get any better, but I was wrong.  Someday You Will Be Loved has such an emotional undercurrent that brought a tear to my eye, since I had just got through a bad breakup right during my initial screening of this cd.  I love this song with all my heart.  Benjamin Gibbard's best song.  Crooked Teeth is a nice, upbeat, happy song.  Brothers On A Hotel Bed's piano part is excellent.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />96/100.  An excellent cd.  Get it now, you will thank me later.
B000E5N62U|5.0|From the first note of this CD to the last is pure \\"Fagen Perfection.\\"  The music is remarkable and the harmonies are impeccable.  I would recommend this to anybody who likes great music, especially Steely Dan fans.  BUY IT, BUY IT BUY IT!!!!

I don't know why so many people don't like it so much, it has MAD beats and Beyonce has superb vocals. <br />Crazy in Love - 10/10 A CLASSIC!! <br />Naughty Girl - 10/10 Another huge hit. Sexy and cool. <br />Baby Boy (feat. 10/10 Sean Paul) - Hot dance track, ANOTHER HIT! <br />Hip-Hop Star 9/10 - Hot song, could've been another single. <br />Be With You 9/10 - Ahh, this is where Beyonce starts showing her more R&B side. Nice, smooth, slow, and sexy track <br />Me, Myself, and I 10/10 - Hot R&B track. Meanful lyrics. <br />Yes 10/10 - Awesome R&B track, her lyrics happen a lot in real life. <br />Signs (feat. Missy Elliott) 10/10 - I love this song, I like Missy's touch. <br />Speechless 11/10 - MY FAVORITE TRACK!! THIS SONG IS SOO SEXY AND IT'S NICE AND SLOW. The best part is her ending, it's sooo sexy, I LOVE IT!!!! <br />That's How You Like It (feat. Jay-Z) 8/10 - Cool track with Jay-Z, something about the beat I'm not to crazy about. <br />The Closer I Get To You (feat. Luther Vandross) 7/10 - Probably my least favorite track. It's sounds too old for me. <br />Dangerously In Love 2 9/10 - Sweet song. <br />Beyonce Interlude (get's no rating) - just a sweet interluder <br />Gift From Virgo 8/10 - Nice lyrics, but no beat... <br />Daddy 9/10 - Really sweet song, and nice beat.   <br />To wrap this up, this album will be a classic in my CD collection and hopefully and many other peoples. Beyonce is sexy, cool, and most importantly has a beautiful voice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Allow me to preface my review by stating that I'm not, what I would consider to be, a Science Fiction zealot.  Yes, I liked The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Star Wars and its sequels (not so much the prequels), and all of the Harry Potter novels and movies.  However, I generally dislike most science fiction movies and television programs, including the predecessor of them all, \\"Star Trek.\\"  Although I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Firefly,\\" which I believe is inaccurately categorized as a space western, I have never even watched a single episode of \\"Buffy.\\"  For those of you who don't know, \\"Buffy\\" was directed and produced by Joss Whedon, the director and producer of \\"Firefly.\\"  What I'm trying to convey is that this series should appeal to a varied audience, not just to those individuals who like Science Fiction. <br /> <br />I was introduced to the \\"Firefly\\" series by a co-worker.  I had never heard of the program previously, but I was hooked after watching the first disc in the series.  The first episode of disc 1 provides background and introduces some of the main characters.  I must admit that I almost stopped watching after the first episode, but I'm glad I didn't.  It wasn't until I watched two or three episodes, and became more familiar with the main characters, that I was truly hooked.  There are interesting story lines and the acting makes you care about the characters. <br /> <br />I highly recommend \\"Firefly\\" to anyone who enjoyed \\"Star Wars.\\"  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds', the main character, wit and wry sense of humor reminds me a lot of Han Solo.  I hope the rumors are true that Whedon is contemplating reviving the series.  If not, perhaps he'll produce and direct a sequel to \\"Serenity,\\" an affiliated movie which I also highly recommend, that has the entire \\"Firefly\\" cast.

0805211063|4.0|So much of what Kafka wrote about sounds like the place that Dilbert works in.  Granted it has a different historical reference of early 20th century Prague, but bureaucracy is the same in any time.  Beginning with the idea that no one can tell K. why he has been hired, the Castle cannot have made a mistake, we then follow him as he goes down the yellow brick road looking for the White Rabbit.<br /><br />You have to understand Kafka's life to truly understand his writings.  He spent most of his life working as a clerk in an insurance company.  He spent the majority of his life living in the post-World War I, Czechoslovakia, in a city that was originally designed to be the provincial capital of part of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy.  All of a sudden it is the capital of a very week central european republic.  So you have a large establishment, that doesn't have anything to do anymore but keep itself in business.<br /><br />Up until WWI, most of the Czech elite, spoke and read in German. The only people who spoke Czech (or Slovak) were the illiterate peasants in the countryside.  At the time of independence in 1918, there were few if any courses taught in Czech at the University of Prague, and all government business was conducted in German.<br /><br />Kafka, was a non-practicing Czech Jew who had to learn Yiddish and Hebrew as an adult.  He was the ultimate outsider; he spoke the wrong language and didn't practice the wrong religion; but then he didn't practice the right religion.  His life, to say the least, was going nowhere fast, and that was only because it was going downhill.  Based on descriptions of him by his friends, he was most likely a manic-depressive and had at least two known 'breakdowns'.  He was terrible at relations with the opposite sex, having twice been engaged and then having broken them off.<br /><br />There is a Lewis Carroll/Marx Brothers (not including Karl) flow to his writings; and since it seems to be train-of-thought, you wonder if he was ever on the right one, at least in his own mind.<br /><br />When you keep in your own mind, that his writings predate movies like Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' or Chalie Chaplin's  'Modern Times' you can see his genius of describing workers as slaves to the system.<br /><br />Who but some one who worked as an insurance clerk, could really understand the feeling of forelorness of the individual faced with an enormous bureaucracy that was mostly concerned with perpetuating itself.  That the book doesn't have a true ending, makes more of an impression that if it had one.  It better reflects how things don't always
0140177396|5.0|George and Lennie are two guys who travel together from one farm to another for work. George made a promise to Lennie's Aunt Clara to take care of Lennie. Lennie is not a smart fellow and him and George have been friends since they were kids.  <br /> They have a plan to work and save all their money so they can buy a house with some land and have rabbits. Lennie will tend these rabbits. They get to their new job on a farm where they will be bailing hey. Lennie is a good hard worker. He can't talk to the boss' son, Curley because George has a feeling that he's going to start trouble. Curley's wife, jail time waiting to happen, live on the plantation and Lennie gets into some trouble with her. <br /> This book was great. It was easy to read, and hard to put down. John Steinbeck describes his characters very well. I liked Lennie because he's so innocently stupid. He loves soft things and things that are beautiful. It was one of our required reading books in tenth grade and I wish that I `d read it then.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|I'm not calling it a perfect album, but it is a very enjoyable. Many tunes, including \\"Prairie Wind\\" and \\"Just Like Greta\\" are very strong. Oddly the only one I don't care for is \\"Keep Mediocrity at Bay\\".
B0000AM6K2|3.0|If you were there(I was 17),you've heard this already,like you heard most good rock and roll the first time around. That being said,yes this is a faithful rendering of the way music sounded back then BUT- although Josh replicated the sound/songwriting to  a T,it is almost a throwaway compared to his other material. You want Josh? Start with any of his other albums first. By the way,Nashville,his next album after this,was a great return to form.I am breathlessly waiting for the new one.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|So Tim Burton was a co-producer? We have just a faint whiff of what made the first two five-star features. I intend to buy this one on DVD, if only to grasp a fragment of what Batman was, and luckily the newest director, from what I've heard, has breathed more life into the franchise. I submit to you this, though... had Tim Burton directed the third movie as his last, how about Michael Keaton still as Batman, Robin Williams as the Riddler, and Billy Dee Williams, as he should've been, as Two-Face. How about, no Robin? Or Robin, if you must, in the last five minutes of the film? That version of the film still plays in my head.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|amazingly well done again by p. jackson. so thrill and so....what can i say? i think now we could put a stop to remake king kong again and again. this is IT!! what a roller coaster ride!!! just like what the heroine said to king kong: 'you are beautiful...' yes, king kong is more human than a republican, that's for sure :-)
B000E1155E|1.0|I've heard crap in my life but this right up there with the best, when did these guys start playing? the same day they recorded this crap. Anybody that knows about playing an instrument will cringe when they hear this. Is everybody in England smoking crack? This country has given us great music & muscians, Artic Monkeys does not apply to neither. This sounds like a bad garage band. Waste of money I would rather take the money and buy a hot dog and a orange soda rather than waste my hard earn money. Like the blokes would say this is pure RUBBISH!!!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Very good 1995 film adaptation of Jane Austen's last novel Persuasion, finally available on DVD. Ciaran Hind \\"is\\" Captain Wentworth and the film manages to capture the nostalgic, almost tragic quality of this semi-autobiographical novel which fortunately has a happy ending.

0062502174|5.0|My reading history has garnered the opinion that great texts rely on maxim that pain breeds great art; resulting in my distaste for \\"little gems\\" of stories and a disregard for anything uplifting as fluff. Books can expand your knowledge and add to your souls progression. This is an upbeat novel that I loved. It's a quick easy read but has great comments on finding your purpose in life and offers insight to Islam that put it on par with great Eastern theology, namely ideas of the oneness of all life and the individual's place in creation. How did Christianity lose that focus? Great stuff here.
0312979479|5.0|I love Agatha Christie and I love a good mystery. This book did not disappoint. It had me guessing who the murderer was till the end, has a nice surprise ending. If you like mystery books you will love this one.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I love the DVD, I knew I missed some episodes and this was a way to fill in the blanks. The only dissapoinment is that after each episode you have to turn off the closed caption feature.
B00005KHJM|5.0|5 stars for the original version of this film wich is a brilliant piece of compelling & provocative art! Art means what ever you think it means & to me this eerie,lusty & thought provoking painting come to life called \\"The Wicker Man\\" delivers a lesson on how dangerous nonsensical & hypocritically alike religion truly is & makes me very proud to not be all caught up in the ridiculous limitations of a belief system. There is no one way or right way to go about life. All forms of religion can be & have been taken too far. Used intentionally & unintentionally to harm others. It is the greatest road block in the evolutionary process of the human mind & one way or another it is sure to play the lead role in our demise.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|Enjoyable if you've spent time in Europe and can relate to the scenery and hostel lifestyle. <br /> <br />Enjoyable if you'd like to witness the absolutely worst possible vacation in Europe before you embark upon your own. <br /> <br />Not enjoyable if you're stuck on all movies meeting \\"pie in the sky\\" credentials when certain genres achieve their objectives through non-conformist means--ie: this movie.

0143034901|4.0|The Shadow of the Wind starts out as a post war novel where 10 year old Daniel Sempere is recovering from the loss of his mother while Spain recovers from the war.  The book quickly dips into fantasy as Daniel is brought by his father into the Cemetery of Forgotten books, a hole in the wall shop which turns out to have an endless library of books within it.  Here Daniel discovers the book, The Shadow of the Wind, written by Julian Carax, an author who seems to have vanished along with most of his work.<br /><br />From it's brief dip into fantasy, the novel quickly becomes a mystery and an adventure, when Daniel becomes obsessed with tracing what happened to Julian Carax, a move which endangers both his and his father's lives.  The life story of Carax has something for everyone.  It's a mixture of passionate-romance, tragedy, murder mystery and ghost story. As Daniel gets older, his life begins to parallel Carax's life.<br /><br />The book is quickly paced, rich with character development and curious, oftentimes sordid little details. What stops me from giving it 5 stars is it felt almost like the book was trying to be too many things. At some points in the book it was starting to read almost like a fairy tale, yet the sordid details were almost like a horror-B-movie.  In addition, the ending ties up things so neatly, it's almost a let down. I wouldn't say it is a great literary piece but if you are looking for an entertaining novel to while away the time or lose yourself in, then I would recommend this book to you.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Number of Discs: 1<br /><br />Tracks: 15<br /><br />Music Composed by: Klaus Badelt<br /><br />Score Overproduced by: Hans Zimmer<br /><br />Executive Soundtrack Producers: Jerry Bruckheimer and Bob Badami<br /><br />Featuring: Hollywood Studio Symphony<br /><br />Album Design: Steve Sterling<br /><br />Extras: The booklet has a few various scenes from the movie including a whole page of Johnny Depp in his Jack Sparrow costume on top of a mast.<br /><br />All the music featured on this disc is lovely! That's why I first purchased this wonderful Official (or Original) Soundtrack. Below is a list of the Tracks with Names, ratings I have given them by my own opinions and a small blerb.<br /><br />Track 1. Fog Bound (4 of 5)<br /><br />Heard during the first scene when the British ship is found destroyed by Pirates. A powerful and romantic piece, a beautiful colliation of music. The reason I gave it 4 was because it's a little slow to start but is rather beautiful anyway.<br /><br />Track 2. The Medallion Calls (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when Jack is standing on the mast of his sinking dingy. It sounds rather courageous and suits the introduction to the famous Jack Sparrow. A rather pretty piece with strong and pepy music.<br /><br />Track 3. The Black Pearl (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when the Black Pearl is shown. Features parts of Jack's theme, obvious because it is his ship. A rather random array of instruments makes this piece fit perfectly together. It is dark themed which suits the Pearl well.<br /><br />Track 4. Will and Elizabeth (3 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when Will and Elizabeth meet. A mildly strong piece. Rather like other pieces in Pirates of the Caribbean just changed in areas, so I wasn't too high on this one.<br /><br />Track 5. Swords Crossed (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when the crew of the Black Pearl turn into the undead. This music is quick, loud and strong to overpower you which is wonderful. It's a gorgeous combination of all the instruments and makes you feel overpowered.<br /><br />Track 6. Walk the Plank (4 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when Elizabeth is onboard the Black Pearl. A very strong piece mixed with jittery sounds to make you feel uncomfortable. Quiet lovely.<br /><br />Track 7. Barbossa is Hungry [Barbossa's Theme] (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when Barbossa transforms into the undead. A gorgeous random feel to Pirates of the Caribbean, it is forceful, loud and quiet a happy powerful piece. It is Barbossa's theme throughout the movie and is quiet suiting to him.<br /><br />Track 8. Blood Ritual (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard in the Pirate Cave. A rather slow and moving piece that suddenly gets quicker paced.<br /><br />Track 9. Moonlight Serenade (4 of 5)<br /><br />Heard in the moonlight. Another slow piece that seems more like a dance theme until the darker music kicks in and draws you back into the world of Pirates of the Caribbean. Again we hear the reuse of Jack's Theme.<br /><br />Track 10. To the Pirates' Cave! (5 of 5)<br /><br />When the crew are in the Pirates Cave. Seems more like remix of Track 5 and Jack's Theme. A lot louder, stronger and features what seems like more impact then the first mix.<br /><br />Track 11. Skull and Crossbow (4 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when Jack is escaping the British guards. A remix of Jack's Theme. Very strong and overpowering.<br /><br />Track 12. Bootstrap's Bootstraps (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when the Pirates and British are fighting. Has a number of trumpets and sounds like a very British themed piece. Becomes jittery and remixes a lot of the other pieces in this CD including its own version of music.<br /><br />Track 13. Underwater March (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard during the Undead's underwater march. Very spooky music, slow to begin with and becomes very strong as the tension mounts. Different compared to other pieces in the CD. There is a breathing in the background too which adds to the strength.<br /><br />Track 14. One Last Shot (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard when Jack and Barbossa are fighting. Very soft at the beginning and remixes a few earlier pieces. Suddenly becomes darker themed. A victorious piece that is very beautiful toward the end.<br /><br />Track 15. He's a Pirate [Jack's Theme] (5 of 5)<br /><br />Heard during the times when Jack Sparrow appears. A gorgeous colliation of music that fits the theme of the famous Jack Sparrow. Very catchy and suiting the Pirate Captain.er pieces. Suddenly becomes darker themed. A victorious piece that is very beautiful toward the end. <br /> <br />Track 15. He's a Pirate [Jack's Theme] (5 of 5) <br />Heard during the times when Jack Sparrow appears. A gorgeous colliation of music that fits the theme of the famous Jack Sparrow. Very catchy and suiting the Pirate Captain.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|An amazing feat! I read the comics many years agoo and wass really impressed by the stark contrast that Frank Miller created using black and white on the visuals, ito emulate the mood of a decadent city. How is the movie going to pull this one off. <br /> <br />If you are a special efx buff, you will love this one as the director has shown you in the special feature session s how he used neon colours to create the contrast. It was so well done you think you are actually reading the comics itself.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is the best show in TV right now. My Sundays are better just because of McDreamy. Shonda Rimes has truly created a wonderful show. ER meets Melrose. The show, which is rather addictive, contains truly interesting and appealing plots.
B000056MOQ|4.0|Wonderful to see the Coronation Mass sung in a liturgical context, though the focus in the video is on the music (naturally), rather than the pope celebrating Mass. Very moving nontheless. Not only is Karajan a great performer; John Paul is pretty impressive, too!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|WELL. SOMEBODY RECOMMENDED ME THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL WHEN I DIDNT HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT THE REAL MEANING OF THIS MOVIE...AFTER THINKING IT TWICE, I DECIDED TO TRY IT...AND TO TELL THE REAL TRUE MEANING: I LOVED IT AND IT MADE ME CRY.

CHILDREN NEED TO GROW LIVING EVERY STAGE OF THEIR YEARS, AND STIMULATION OF IMAGINATION IS SOMETHING THAT PARENTS CAN HELP TO...WHEN THEIR KIDS GROW THEY WILL SURELY DO THE SAME TO THEIR KIDS, AND THIS TRADITION WILL REALLY HELP US TO MAKE MORE SANE AND GENTLE, KIND, RESPONSIBLE, SENSIBLE HUMAN BEINGS!

EVERYONE OF THEIR CHARACTERS HAS ALSO A MEANING IN OUR LIVES, AND PROBABLY OCCUPIES A LITTLE PLACE IN OUR IMAGINATION!THAKS AMAZON FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO ENJOY THIS PRECIOUS GIFT FOREVER!
0767802551|3.0|This is one of the more entertaining films in its genre.  The teaming of Johnny Depp and Al Pacino was a brilliant stroke, and both deliver outstanding performances.  Michael Madsen also gives a noteworthy performance as Sonny Black, the capo who very nearly inducted Pistone into the Bonnano crime family.  Those who have read the book will notice that there are quite a few factual errors, but the film is nonetheless entertaining, and well worth buying for repeat viewing.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|For me, I like the intercut scenes from one story to the other.  I thought that was clever, but the new DVD have a version that seperates the story and it doesn't work for me.  Plus the additional minutes are miniscule at best.  They don't really add anything to the story and that is the biggest disappointment.  The cool thing about this DVD is all the extras and this is where this version far outshines the previous release one.  I think it's cool, compelling, especially the interviews with the filmmakers and the cast.   <br /> <br />The reason why I like the theater version over the re-edited version is that the theater version confuses you.  You never know whats is going to happen next and the filmmaker leaves it up to you to related all the stories together and in what time line they happened.  Luckily for us, the theater version is included on this DVD so if you do not own the movie (which most of us do), its a great buy.  If you do own the DVD then you have to ask yourself, do you want to get into the great extra features?  If you don't get into things like that, then don't buy it for the additional minute or so that each story gets.  Personally it's worth the price for the extras.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I hardly ever watch TV..especialy soaps. It was only until I got stuck out in Afghanistan that I came across the Complete first Season of Desperate Housewives on DVD. I had heard of the show before from some of my buddies but I was never really interested in watching it. I was very surprised at how hooked I was on the show by the end of only the second episode. I have watched the whole first season now and I can't wait to see the second one. Alot of guys are put off simply by the title \\"Desperate Houswives\\" they immediately assume that it is geared for a female audience. This is definetly not the case, and I know alot of guys in the Mid-East and back in the US that love the show despite being part of an extremely Hardcore/Macho oriented outfit: The US Marines. Bottom line..if you haven't seen it yet..watch it..you won't be insulting your manhood, and you'll find out that it's pretty good. If nothing else..watch it for the chics..they're all hot! Especially Marcia Cross and Eva Longoria.
B000001EG6|5.0|This is the early stuff when Elton and Bernie were young, earnest, and hungry.  Prior to the formation of the Elton John Band, performers include Davey and Nigel among others. <br /> <br />The songs are very melodic with pleasant poetic lyrics whether for beautiful ballads like The Greatest Discovery or the rocking Take Me to the Pilot.  This album is best known for the enduring hit, Your Song. <br /> <br />Of the early Elton works, this and Honky Chateau are must-haves.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Can you believe I'd actually forgotten this album was coming out?  Strange how 12 years makes a difference.  I can remember counting down the days until Division Bell was released.  I even went to my local cd shop everyday for a week before the album was officially out to try and badger the staff into cutting into their boxes early.  But there I was this afternoon in the cd shop, actually looking for something completely different, when I noticed it on the shelf. <br />That more than anything sums up not only my attitude to the album, but the album itself.  As a younger fan, I lived and breathed on Floyd, but as you get older, the urgency lessens.  Now I am completely content as I sit at home this evening, listening to this album on repeat.   David has created an album that makes me wish that I was, in fact, where he is now.  It is an album of subtlety and beauty, musings of a man who knows where he's been, and what he's been through to get there.  If he wants to take his time and share his peace with me, I am all for it. <br />Reviews I have read on the net this evening have constantly harped on his lack of \\"bite.\\"   Yes, it would be nice to see what he and Waters could create now, but at the same time, I hardly need to hear angst and anger from a man of 60.  The Rolling Stones tried to do it on \\"A Bigger Bang,\\" and it came off sounding somehow false and lacking.  I don't want to think of myself as being a bitter man at that age.  And I'm happy that Mr. Gilmour doesn't believe he needs to be either.
B000301YY8|2.0|When I first heard James Blunt, I was all set to love him, really. I liked his voice, it was unique and I was intrigued...    ...And then I actually read his lyrics. What follows are the actual words to \\"You're Beautiful\\":    My life is brilliant.  My love is pure.  I saw an angel.  Of that I'm sure.  She smiled at me on the subway.  She was with another man.  But I won't lose no sleep on that,  'Cause I've got a plan.    You're beautiful. You're beautiful.  You're beautiful, it's true.  I saw you face in a crowded place,  And I don't know what to do,  'Cause I'll never be with you.    Yeah, she caught my eye,  As we walked on by.  She could see from my face that I was,  F**king high,  And I don't think that I'll see her again,  But we shared a moment that will last till the end.    You're beautiful. You're beautiful.  You're beautiful, it's true.  I saw you face in a crowded place,  And I don't know what to do,  'Cause I'll never be with you.  You're beautiful. You're beautiful.  You're beautiful, it's true.  There must be an angel with a smile on her face,  When she thought up that I should be with you.  But it's time to face the truth,  I will never be with you.    Um...wow. Somebody, ANYBODY, tell me those aren't lyrics you could scrawl out during your lunch break. Tell me the words \\"Yeah, she caught my eye/As we walked on by/She could see from my face that I was/F**king high\\" are more profound than something a middle schooler could write on a valentine.    I like his music, and I love his voice, but I just cannot get past the lyrics, no matter what anyone says. They are just TOO gut-wrenchingly cheesy and uninspired.    One reviewer seems to be impressed with his mention of Dorian Gray in one song, but nothing in any of his lyrics leaves me with the impression that he's particularly well-read, unless you count perusing lyrics to Air Supply songs for inpiration as reading.    I say he's got the potential, but until his lyrics reach a level of complexity that requires more than 4th grade reading skills, I will find him the most inexplicably famous artist since Aaron Carter.
B000002LTU|3.0|An attempt from Miles to get into hiphop, but unlike other times where he tried to fusion his music with other types of music, nothing really new or exciting comes out of it. Instead it becomes a little mechanical with Miles blowing over some tracks, that sound like standard hiphop fare with slammin' drums and lots of loops. Maybe if Miles had participated himself in preparing the tracks, something interesting would have come of it, but except for tracks like \\"Mystery\\" and \\"High Speed Chase\\", generally the record sounds pretty sterile and not particularly engaging.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I used to like the guy that made this movie.  that is, until I saw this movie.  sigh, well, i hope he made a lot of money off the suffering of others.  he's lucky this is a free country, so free that he was allowed to make a movie like this and show it in theaters and sell the dvd.  I can almost see why other countries don't allow bashing of their leaders.  this was the most ridiculous, one-sided load of garbage I had ever seen in my life. if he doesn't like bush that much, he can get out of the country.  Bush is human and honest and did what he could under the circumstances. If he thinks he could've done better, he can run for president, instead of mocking others.  he makes me sick. <br /> <br />In response to the famous scene of bush reading to little kids after hearing that the first plane attacked, keep in mind, that at the time, we didn't know what the first plane was.  at first, the news thought it could've been an accident, and was only later thought to be possibly, and possibly paranoid to think it, a terrorist attack.  my first thought was that in speculation that the first plane, (assuming all his opinionated facts are straight), could've been a drunk pilot, the second plane was the confirmation of attack, when bush was already in the classroom.  What could've been done about that?  Shoot down all the planes in the sky?  Which ones are full of terrorists? and there are innocent citizens onboard.   <br /> <br />Moore admits to having a grudge against Bush as well. So this is really just him getting payback for Bush telling him to get a real job?  Probably.   <br /> <br />Whether Moore's facts really are true or false or manipulated to fit his own opinion, the point is that Bush did all he could afterwards and was even mocked for htat.  now, we're as naive as we were before the attack.  we're like, gawd, chill out bush, youre so paranoid. its not like it'll ever happen again or anything.  if we're like that now, even after such an unexpected attack, then imagine how carefree we were before it.  no wonder we didn't know what to do. Bush is trying hard to protect the country, to keep the same mistakes from happening again, and people make fun of him for it.   <br /> <br />Moore needs to think, rather than judge.  when he's president and does a better job, i'll bite my tongue.  till then, he's a golddigger, and if this movie really is just his message to the world, and if he's so high and mighty as to assume he can make a movie about other people's faults and mistakes, then he should donate every penny he earned to charity instead of being such a hypocrite.
0930289528|5.0|I've read it about ten times and each time I still find myself moved, shocked, impressed and always coming away satisified. Truly a great novel<br /><br /> If you are trying to find out about the plot before you read, STOP. Just order the thing. Moore creates an incredibly intricate universe of characters that are both likable and believable.<br /><br />AS I SAID: If you're interested in seeing what the comic art form is capable of when geared toward an adult audience, rush out and grab a copy of \\"V for Vendetta\\" today.

0060794410|3.0|I thought this book was interesting and thought provoking, but not that much out of the ordinary.  The fact that the writer did research and tells how he concluded his finding was an added bonus.  In the end, I didn't feel that the book was worth a second read.

B000002KHH|5.0|PARANOID is arguably the greatest heavy rock album made by the greatest heavy metal band BLACK SABBATH.This is rock music at it's best with pile driving rockers like WAR PIGS,IRON MAN and PARANOID.Ignore the below loser and GET THIS TODAY.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I think in large part, those that don't like this movie just have never been a part of this world.  The rural America that Napoleon Dynamite portrays, and the people in it, are very real, and immediately identifiable to anybody who has ever lived in a place like this. <br /> <br />I think without having had some sort of common experience with the characters in this film, a lot of reviewers here dismiss it as a mean-spirited movie designed to mock geeks - but for those that lived in this sort of place, it's just the opposite.  It celebrates the wierdness, the oddity, and the awkwardness of a certain section of the high-school crowd.   <br /> <br />The cool kids at school? You barely notice them in NP - they're characterless, and barely there. And the nerds and geeks are unapologetic, living their wierd, interesting and quirky lives. <br /> <br />I knew these people, and in part I WAS some of these people. Repeated viewings strengthen the strange sense of connection and - oddly - nostalgia for this place. <br /> <br />It might seem unbelievable or strange to those who've never experienced such a world, but this is a pretty truthful movie - which is what makes it so great to many of those who love it.
B000002H97|5.0|THE BLACK ALBUM from Metallica is their last great album after AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and RIDE THE LIGHTNING.I really loved this album as it contains some of the finest songs in WHEREVER I MAY ROAM,THE UNFORGIVEN and the excellent NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.This is one album which should be present in every rock fans collection.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0393327655|5.0|This is the best and most thought-provoking book I have read in a long time. <br />Sam Harris is an excellent writer and presents his arguments with clarity and ingenuity. He questions why reason and evidence is what makes people believe in propositions in all areas, except in that of religion, and points to the danger with this one exception, the danger of blind faith. He challenges religious dogma, yet recognizes the need for spirituality. <br />This is a book that needs to be read by as many people as possible, even though I fear that it will be disregarded by people of faith. <br />Read it and open your eyes!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|BROTHERS IN ARMS is a great album from a hugely talented british band who are as talented as PINK FLOYD,THE WHO,LED ZEPPELIN and THE ROLLING STONES.This album contains excellent songs like MONEY FOR NOTHING,SO FAR AWAY,WALK OF LIFE and BROTHERS IN ARMS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie finds the kid in all of us.  Once you watch this movie you'll understand what it means to \\"hear the bell\\" even as an adult.  Excellent family movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|*cough* <br /> <br />After reading this review, I spent a few hours listening to Spiral Architect.  I believe they were described as \\"complex\\", \\"hard to get into\\" and \\"far from mainstream\\".  Complex?  No.  Far from mainstream?  Yes.  Hard to get into?  Yes, but that's probably because the music was repetitious, uncomplex, and annoying.  The vocals sounded like a million other things I've heard.  I could pick out every single instrument they were playing and tell you what it was doing.  I will admit that the guitar parts and drums were pretty cool.  The band members obviously know what they're doing, but they have a lot less to offer in the way of MUSIC than Radiohead does.  The style doesn't differ from one song to another.  \\"Hey guys, how about in this song we play the drums and the electric guitars REALLY QUICKLY?!\\"  That's what I imagined as I listened.  (With the exception of \\"Occam's Razor\\" and \\"Insect\\".)  And could somebody please explain to me why \\"Excessit\\" and \\"Fountainhead\\" are basically the same song?  You hand any instrument to Radiohead and they'll make music.  If you handed a drumset, an electric guitar, and a bass guitar to Spiral Architect, they'd play you something that sounded a lot like everything else they play.  So, basically, this is a review of Spiral Architect in response to my injured Radiohead pride.  S. A. didn't suck, I'll give you that.  But they didn't do much for me.  They weren't exciting, they weren't emotional, and they weren't complex.  I listened to \\"Insect\\", the song it took ten listenings to understand, and understood it after about 2 listenings.  And don't go around feeling all special because you found an underground band who you had a hard time getting into.  That doesn't mean they're good.  If you find an underground band who plays something interesting, give me a call.
B00005JNX0|4.0|Good family fare.  Our kids love to \\"watch Alex\\".  Funny characters.  Thumbs up!!
0316172324|5.0|Gladwell scores again!  Well-written book that advances its basic concepts with well described examples that illuminate the ideas and prompt the reader (at least this one) to consider specific applications in my own personal and professional lives. <br /> <br />Reading this book emphasizes the value of my \\"trusting my gut\\" even when I cannot immediately put my finger on the exact logic for doing so.
B000CS45QU|4.0|Having loved the bassy beat-driven Daybreaker, Beth goes back to her Central Reservation roots with a more acoustic and \\"earthy\\" sounding album. Her voice still plays wonderfully amidst the poppy, Carole King-esque, guitar tunes. I have yet to find a heartstring tugger on this album, but I am sure in time one will emerge. Check out the music video for the first single as well. It is a good summarization of what you can expect on the album.
B00005JO9J|5.0|No other hospital drama even compares to Grey's Anatomy!  This show is in a class of its own. <br /> <br />This show is focused on a group of new surgical-interns at Seattle Grace Hospital in Washington.  From the very first episode you will find the drama gripping and compelling.  This show picks up where the others fell short.  If you are a fan of doctor shows and have an interest in medical procedures, you will definitely love Grey's Anatomy!  It combines the great drama with very realistic surguries. <br /> <br />Season 1 was a mid-season replacement of another ABC show, so this box set includes two DVDs with all 9 episodes from the first season.  Little did everyone know how well this show would do.  Look for season 2 on DVD soon! <br /> <br />Fans of shows like ER, or how ER was in the beginning, should really love Grey's Anatomy.  You will probably find yourself not being able to quit watching season 1 until you're done with the finale.  This makes for a great weekend movie thing! <br /> <br />Highly recommended to all!
6305784116|5.0|For Disney lovers or simply animation fans, this is a superb movie, as well as to any cinema admirer. <br />The movie itself is very charming, and it has comedy and fun in the right proportion, including the magic romance beteween the sofisticated cat lady high class Duchess and the O'Malley street smart cat. The kittens come along with their inocence and childhood. <br />Do not wait much to get this wonderful movie in your dvd collection.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I used to be a bigger fan of Joe Satriani than Steve Vai about 10 years ago.  Now I quickly get bored of new Satriani albums, but Vai's music just moves me.  Lotus feet for example, wow, words cannot describe what that song does to me. Thanks Steve.

0618164413|5.0|My 3-year-old wants only this book every night.  And I enjoy the leisurely pace of the dialog, and the clever and charming illustrations.  I also like that the stories are somewhat longer than her previous favorites as a challenge to her attention span. <br /> <br />The treatment of animals sometimes seems a little anachronistic.  I don't personally see any harm in this, but I think there are parents nowadays who might not be keen on the story with the pet bunnies, the depiction of a zoo that has a bunch of cages, or the story with the travelling performing animal show. <br /> <br />The binding on our book has been quite durable.  Perhaps if you get one that falls apart as described by a previous reviewer you should just return it and ask for a new one?  My daughter has a Disney Princess storybook that I WISH would fall apart!  ;-D
B000088E6D|5.0|This is a fabulous display of Michael Buble's talent.  I don't think I've ever heard something I didn't like.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am really pleased to have been recommended this item by amazon. I had never heard of it before, but reading the rave reviews, I had to get it. I was not disappointed in the least! I just got it 3 days ago, and I think I've watched it about 5 times already. If you are a helpless romantic as I am, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JO9J|5.0|The Season 1 DVD set of Grey's Anatomy was well worth the investment.  To get the whole first season of one of the best shows on television for under $20 is a STEAL!  Whether this has been your favorite show from the beginning, or you are finally giving into the hype, this is a MUST HAVE!  Getting to stare at all of the hotties is just an added bonus...
B000E8QVWY|3.0|I didn't know much about the life of Johnny Cash prior to seeing this movie.  I wasn't even particularly a fan.  I must admit that I enjoyed this film, though.  The most impressive factor to me (as a recording engineer and producer) was Joaquin Phoenix's ability to emulate the vocal characteristics of Johnny Cash.  He came just about as close as an actor could be expected to come.  Reese Witherspoon also does a very respectable job of carrying a tune in this movie. <br /> <br />The life being chronicled in this movie is certainly an interesting one, yet it is certainly not a story we haven't seen before.  It bears countless similarities to other \\"rock star\\" movies we've all seen in the past.  They come from humble beginnings, take a chance and make it big, crumble under the pressure of the fame, turn to drugs and become dependant - and eventually get cleaned up by the few people who give a damn.  Sometimes this kind of story doesn't have a happy ending.  Luckliy for Johnny Cash and all of his fans, this one did. <br /> <br />The movie is engaging.  Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderful together. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000301YY8|5.0|I received my CD in the time frame that I was given by Amazon.com and I got a great deal!  I love Back to Bedlam and I thoroughly encourage anyone and everyone to buy it!
0887307280|5.0|The book has a powerful, yet common sense message, and should be read by anyone in business, about to go into business and maybe even by employees. A++++
0061020680|4.0|The hours are long, the people you meet on the job tend to make you feel unwelcome, the amount of travel required for the job is mind-boggling, and the requisite decor is monotonous.  Such is the life--- ummm, such is the routine of Death, the anthropomorphic personification of the end of life.  An assistant would ease two of the shortcomings of the job and mitigate a third (sorry, even an assistant is no help with the decor issues), so Death takes on an apprentice.<br /><br />  Death's horse is pale, but is also named Binky.  Death likes cats.  Death is the only character to appear in every Discworld book.  Most enjoyable is how Death alternates between passionless competence in his domain, and mild neurosis regarding his self image and relationships.  Anyone, even Death, who thinks that an adolescent girl is easier to deal with than a younger child deserves what he gets, so Death has adopted a teenage girl.  And boy does Death create work for himself by taking on Mort as an apprentice to aid him and be a companion for his adopted adolescent daughter, Ysabell.<br /><br />Hilarity ensues as Mort becomes romantically involved with a young woman who was one of his scheduled tasks, and we learn more about Death's servant Albert.<br /><br />Pratchett begins to hit his stride in this book, although some later volumes backslide a little.  This volume shows the deftness and brilliance Pratchett is capable of in a well-flowing story.  Very enjoyable, but provides those twists on perpective that make Pratchett so much fun.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Seriously, this movie, after years and years, terrifies me to no end. I saw it when I was a young child, and now at the ripe old age of 18 I'm still scared to death of Pennywise the clown. Anyone that has a clown phobia SHOULD NOT watch this movie. But on to the reviewing: It's a very solid movie with some terrifying parts, but some of the acting is a bit sub-par and the ending is absolutely terrible. I have yet to read the book (I just now acquired it) but from what I've heard the book is much more intricate (and terrifying!). As always, Tim Curry's acting is absolutely superb, in fact, even when I see him in other roles it is hard not to imagine his chilling performance in this movie. I would say this movie is definitely a horror classic, although not for the clown-o-phobes. DO NOT take a shower after you watch this movie!
B00005JOE8|5.0|V for Vendetta is the film you want to see with friends BEFORE dinner so that you can discuss it DURING dinner.  Wow.<br /><br />From the movie's web site, I found out that many of V's ( the main character) lines are not \\"original,\\" but come from quotes of other, real,  famous (and infamous) leaders.<br /><br />The action starts quickly, but the story builds slowly. To the end, you are still waiting for answers.  Thank goodness the director and writers leave some unanswered... this is a powerful technique.<br /><br />There's even more.  Media manipulation by government.  The People's revolt.  The importance of youth in shaping the future.  Experiments on people.  Why good cops are essential in society.  There is a segment dealing with homosexuality and a horrible, draconian government approach to it (Nazi Germany is the obvious reference here).  It will be interesting to see how critics relate this part of the film to the \\"controversy\\" over Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />I tell you, this is a heck of a film.  And did I mention the action?  Oh, and the hints about the Matrix connection.  This was NOT a \\"Matrix clone\\" at all.<br /><br />Should have been rated PG-13 instead of R.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Ok, so i read the reviews figured it can't be bad, after all I have always liked Dave's guitar playing, but after listening to it a 3-4 times I am still not sure what its appeal is. Some of the tracks are really great, I am sucker for a swooping guitar, but others are awful. One reviewer raves about Polly's songwriting skills however the Division Bell really stunk. Sorry Dave but maybe it's me that is not ready for the album. Two out of 5 for the couple of songs that do shine. Thanks for the great memories though (by the way, which one's pink?)
B00008YLV2|4.0|Sometimes I have this view that war movies are a ticket to an easy Oscar. While it's not a bad thing to make such a movie, there's almost a feeling that if you want to be taken seriously, do a war movie or a biopic or an epic. Michael Bay, known for cinematic fluff like Bad Boys and Armageddon puts out Pearl Harbor, graphically great but emotionally (and everything else) empty. I can't, however, accuse Ridley Scott of doing that since he's always one to make it real as possible, just too bad this film isn't a war classic. <br /> <br />It was meant to be a simple mission, roughly 30-45 minutes in the streets of Mogadishu in Africa. A simple capture mission of a leader's associates and leave. But when 2 black hawk down helicopters are shot down with increasing resistance from all over the city, US soldiers have to fight their way out of the city and try to survive. <br /> <br />The film won Oscars for Editing and Sound and although it's not as immersive and perfect as other war films, it does give you a realistic experience of going through a mission, especially one as high stakes as this one. It's confusing at times though since it's hard to tell who's who and the names on the helmets aren't much help since they move around too much. They are being shot at, yes, but maybe closer camera angles would differentiate who's who from a big list of crew cut soldiers. Gary Rydstrom's work was better on Saving Private Ryan but it's good here as well. <br /> <br />Like that Spielberg film, this one is unflinching at the horrors of war. People are continously shot throughout the film, along with bodies being blown in half, fingers getting half blown off(or all the way, hard to tell) and soldiers digging into a wounded leg, the film is gritty as war can get. However what made the Spielberg film worked as that before a soldier was killed, we got details about the character and room for exploring which made it harder to see someone shot down. Here it's just \\"soldier #1\\" sometimes,or, in my case, it's naming the actual actor's name like \\"there goes Eric Bana, there's Orlando Bloom\\". Speaking of the last one, I'm glad he's not in the film much, never liked him as an actor much so it's perfect. <br /> <br />This is a MASSIVE set with a documentary longing than the actual film and more details into the actual mission. Oddly enough, I understood the mission a lot better through the extras since geographically I didn't know where I was in the film. Some double dips are irritating but here it's excusable since this goes beyond simple making-ofs. Instead of solely including fluffly EPK's(those are the \\"that director rules, this film's great, he's awesome to work with features), they give you lots of background information which helps better understand everything. If only Saving Private Ryan had a big documentary like this. <br /> <br />It's not up there with that Spielberg classic or Coppola's Apocalypse Now but at least it's a great war film period like Full Metal Jacket or Platoon.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I'll admit I bought this soundtrack because I loved the movie and since the DVD is yet to come, and Brokeback Mountain is winding down in theaters, there is precious little out there to savor of this great film. I have listened to it and it so fits the movie and I hadn't realized how much the music goes with the movie.  <br /> <br />I love to listen to all the instrumental sections of the CD and then listen to \\"He Was A Friend of Mine\\" and \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\", then move onto \\"I Don't Want To Say Goodbye\\". My only complaint is that the instrumental sections are bitterly brief, everytime I hear them, I want to hear them go on and on. <br /> <br />If you love the movie like I do. You'll love this.
0140177396|5.0|Though little more than a short story, this is simply my favorite book on the shelf.  I feel that it would be impossible for a reader not to be totally involved with the characters presented within the pages.  Steinbeck does a wonderful job of painting a picture with words, and this book is no exception.  And, I'll wager that even you guys may shed a tear or two before it's over.  The only advice I have to give is, make sure you read this book before watching the movie, and allow your imagination to run wild.
0446677450|3.0|I read this book solely because I am in my mid-thirties and am interested in learning more about investing and sound financial strategies.  I have no interest in \\"get rich overnight\\" gimmicks as I have no faith in them.  We are deluged by \\"how to become a millionaire\\" publications on all side, not to mention endless spam email, telemarketing, con games, lottery ads, etc.  As far as I'm concerned it is all absolutely BS.  There are really only 3 viable ways to make money: have someone give it to you, earn a paycheck, or make some legal financial endeavors (investments, sales, etc.) that pay off.  If there were really so many amazingly easy ways to get rich with little capital or knowledge, this would be a country of millionaires.  Furthermore, the folks pushing \\"strike it rich\\" schemes would simply be off enjoying their money, not talking to a sweaty crowd in an auditorium somewhere. <br /> <br />That being said, Mr. Kiyosaki provided some useful insights about personal financial management; what I took away from the book is that it's important to develop a financial intelligence that is not taught in schools (not elementary or high school, that is).  It is true that, like law, many of us do not fully understand the world of finance, and we should seek to educate ourselves independently to learn more about it.  I agreed with him that nobody wants to be locked into the crippling rat race of working for money to buy expensive things which then compels you to work harder for more money, etc.  And his comments that money does not bring happiness, and failure to manage money properly whether you are rich or poor will lead to misery are hard to dispute. <br /> <br />However, Mr. Kiyosaki spent much of the book either reiterating prior comments or engaging in conflicting statements, such that I wound up taking the good parts (as outlined above) and discarding much of the rest.  He talks a good talk about how money isn't everything - but then spends much of the book extolling the virtues of wealth and not having to work for anyone.  His Porsche, golf clubs, trips, etc. are mentioned quite often.  He rails against taxes and the government but seems to forget that it is the capitalist system in the U.S. that enables him to achieve financial success (or at least, what he asserts is financial success; I tend to suspect his books and games on the practice of making money are more lucrative for him than any actual real estate endeavors).  Therefore, he comes across as a self-centered individual who wants to play the system but refuses to pay any dues.  Don't get me wrong; I don't enjoy paying taxes either, particularly given the fact this country currently is running up massive deficits and tied down in a military engagement I never supported.  However, I refuse to live my life taking what I can get from the system and then saying \\"Sc**w you, Jack, I got mine.\\"  Nobody loves paying taxes - but everyone loves the benefits that come from tax revenues, like paved roads, streetlights, schools, parks, police and fire protection, etc.  <br /> <br />The title of the book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad refers to Mr. Kiyosaki's father (Poor Dad) who was educated but financially ignorant, and a friend's father (Rich Dad) who eschewed schooling for financial strategy.  I really don't believe there was any such \\"Rich Dad\\" individual in real life; it seems a bit too contrived to be realistic.  Certainly the idea of the self-made individual is possible, and the examples shown provide food for thought.  However, Mr. Kiyosaki makes the process of accumulating wealth seem far too easy by outlining some simple real estate transactions.  To his credit, he does state that it takes more than just being in the right place at the right time, but his examples are nonetheless too simplistic.  Common sense and good luck are just not enough.  What is easy to one person may not be so for another.  I work with computers, and it would be very easy for me to diagnose and repair a dead system, but not so easy for the lay person who has not spent years working on PCs.  Similarly, I have no clue how my car works, and am mystified by weird noises, but my next door neighbor the auto mechanic can tell me what is wrong with it.  I simply don't believe it is realistic to read a few financial books and suddenly become more successful than individuals who specialized in this field with degrees and years of experience. <br /> <br />This leads me to my next point: I was very skeptical towards Kiyosaki's views on education.  Education is always important.  Even if you go to college and get a degree in something you will never use, you will always have that degree and it can open doors for you.  Take it from me: I work in technology and do not have a college degree.  I love what I do, but I know that I had better continue loving my work as my alternatives are few and far between.  I can't go into management for instance, as my lack of a degree will dissuade most interviewers from meeting with me.  So, as long as I continue my career without a college diploma the bar is always going to be raised that much higher.  I hate to think that college kids might read this book and decide that school is unnecessary, then drop out and try their hand in some failed financial endeavors that send them home to Mom and Dad with their pockets turned out. <br /> <br />Last but not least, I vehemently opposed Kiyosaki's encouragement to \\"pay yourself first,\\" while leaving bills to be paid last.  I tried that in my early twenties and wound up with a badly battered credit report that took years to clean up.  He claims that this strategy will motivate you to find other ways to make money to pay those creditors.  Well, in my view it's more sensible to keep your nose clean, get the bills paid, and then work that second job (or whatever) to earn some investment funds to play with.  That way you will be able to come home to a house without eviction or foreclosure notices, that has heat and electricity and food in the fridge. <br /> <br />Having read this book I plan to go on and read some other books about investment and financial planning, so I can get a bigger picture of the subject at hand.  I do not, however, think that I would choose to take specific financial advice from Mr. Kiyosaki or others of the same \\"follow this formula for easy success\\" genre. They seem to appeal to the \\"it happened to so-and-so, and it can happen to me too\\" crowd that sees the one millionaire out of 9,999 bankruptcies and decides that's the path for them.  As with the lottery, it takes a certain amount of losers to produce one winner, and therefore that system demands a certain amount of fodder.  Certainly any form of investment at all has the potential to either pay off or provide said fodder to the system to make someone else rich, but I think it's best to be cautious, patient, educate oneself, and steer clear of any easy fixes or allegedly \\"quick payoffs.\\"
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A nice array of musical talent does a great job on George's music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was the victim of poor network ownership - a premature cancel of one of the best shows ever.  This box set at least allows me to enjoy the experience at will. The chararcters have become so dear to me and I always find myself feeling somehow renewed after watching an episode.  If you like stories that are humourous, honest, and real - then you owe it to yourself to pick this up. <br /> <br />Remember - you can't stop the signal.
B0000630BT|3.0|3.5 stars in my opinion. painkiller the song is a killer!...the rest is filled with great and stupid songs. on the great side we have \\"all guns blazing\\" and \\"glory\\" on the stupid side we have \\"metal meltdown\\" and the horrible \\"leather rebel\\" but it's still a good album.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Instantly - from that first moment - you knew it was still there.  The commraderie, the humor, the intensity - all of it.  The crew of Serenity was the same.  All would be right with the Verse.  See it.
B000000OAA|5.0|queen's most rockiest album along with their debut and maybe news of the world. the heavier tracks are gems like brighton rock, flick of the wrist, now i'm hear and the classic stone cold crazy, but sheer heart attack also has it's usual queen diversity \\"bring back that leroy brown\\" is a true masterpiece.
B000BNTM2I|5.0|I had the good fortune to attend the American Idiot concert in Houston.  Believe me, this video makes you feel like you were there, only with a better close-up view of the band. The way they cut the video together is awesome, and makes it very sexy and flashy.  The interviews with the band are fun, but there isn't very much time spent on that, and I would have liked to see more of the behind the stage action.  Some of the interviews with the fans are hilarious.  Mostly, this video is just great rocking music and well worth the investment.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|I know at amazon fans usually try to make every new release out be their best, but AOL is a decent but not great album. Nothing more and nothing less. Just decent!
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is my second favorite NIN album ever created. The first being the Downward Spiral. Trent finally gets into a steady rock rhythm and cuts down on the overabundance of screeches, hisses, and thumps that seem to permeate most of his songs. He's a little more subdued in voice (he still yells, but it's not as angry as it is lyrical) and overall the album haunts you with its words that bely the rocking beat beneath it.  <br /> <br />The epitomy of this is the song \\"Every Day is Exactly The Same.\\" While the rhythm moves you forward, the words make you ponder your life in a painful way. Has your existence lost meaning, are you now a cog in the corporate machine? Trent once again brings important issues to the forefront with his lyrics, your issues.
B000000OAN|5.0|How can anyone give this album less than 5 stars?...It's such a unique album, this band were truly unique in their prime.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Despite a glossy \\"Movie of the Week\\" vibe that hangs over the proceedings, \\"Walk the Line\\" utlimately succeeds due mainly to the powerhouse performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who manages to capture Cash's paronoid, pill-poppin' pathos without pandering to posterity or pratfalling into parody.  And he can sing, too!
B000000OE7|5.0|Made in heaven is an album that hits you in the heart!...I'm not sure how an average rock fan would like this album, but if your a true queen fan you'll probably love it.  A very melodic rock album has freddies last vocal take on \\"mother love\\" and last song freddie ever wrote \\"a winter's tale\\" mixed in with some older completed songs like heaven for everyone and too much love will kill you. My favorite is probably \\"a winter's tale\\" a nice little reflective peom written by freddie. \\"Meanwhile let me live\\" is a great song with a gospel chorus. MIH has aged well!
B00005JNRE|5.0|I thought I was going to see a modified Mary Poppins but ... it is so much better. If Mary was a jolly, magical, sweet nanny, Mc Phee was ugly, menacing but also magical. And the kids were more in number and more incorrigible (which reminds me of Von Trapp children). <br /> <br />What struck me as ingenious is how the nanny became less ugly each time the kids learn something from her lessons. The idea of reflecting the children's behaviour on the nanny's face is certainly not from Poppins. In that way, the children could see the result of their own making without being too self-conscious. Nanny McPhee didn't try to sweeten the bitter medicine, but she made them see how to accept consequences and be creative about it. <br /> <br />I have not read Nurse Matilda but I like the movie because the magic was very beautiful. Ms. Thompson has done two very great jobs, as the nanny and screenwriter. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ok, I'll be at the point. If you like good music, this is a must have for you. If you like her classics like Holiday, Borderline, La Isla bonita, Like A Prayer, Take A Bow, Frozen, or Music, this new album should be no exception. Just look at the instant classic Hung Up.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This band has been great from their debut.  Every CD has been great.  They produce music that is subtle and weaves its way into the brain.  Reviews have to be written right after a CD is released and sent to them, many times not giving them time to fully listen to and appreciate the CD, but allows them to make their deadline.  Probably not a big deal for most bands, but for The Strokes they make music that takes a while to get into, thus for those reviewing it quickly the reviews are many times negative.  I have listened to it since it was released many times.  Yes at first all the songs did seem the same and many were flat.  I now see it as an important piece of work, by an incredibly exciting new band that deserves the hype.  Great songwriting full of energy and subtle brilliance as the songs weave themselves in the brain.  A cathartic release from each song.  It is awesome.  I recommend this CD to anyone willing to go outside immediate enjoyment to appreciate something new.
B00000I2PG|5.0|Why must music sound this good?! This album breaks my heart it sounds so good! I don't understand it!!! How can something look shinier than the shiniest tinsel and still have blood coursing thru it's veins. I wanna do my hair and put my best pout on, meet her by the cigarette machine, have her say she loves me then break my heart, i wanna strut, and still believe in love... <br /> <br />If the Beatles were the soundtrack to ur very thoughts in the 60's ,then this was one of those albums that was the soundtrack to going out, falling inlove and breaking up in the 80's. <br />Where Bowie failed, Martin Fry and Co. succeeded brilliantly with this album in the 80's, with just the right mix of high drama and blue-eyed soul. I imagine them both giving each other the nod...  <br /> <br />With all the garbage clogging up the airwaves and leaving me as a Musician/Producer positively jaded and weary in the 21st Century, discovering this album again is like Vicks Vapour Rub to my senses. These moments r what make Pop great! Provocative, Dynamic, Exciting, Dangerous... <br />There r some bands the likes of 'Elefant' among others who r responsible for some kool moments too, and be it unfair to compare such, but baby this is what ur aiming for! This is the bench-mark... <br /> <br />If ur gonna do 80's retro, do it right for crying out loud! <br />Do ur research, give me the magic! <br />These moments r what made u wanna queue in the rain @ the band's gigs, r what made u wanna put their posters up on ur wall, r what made u walk to save ur dosh instead of taking the bus so u could by that album in the first place! <br /> <br />I actually gave this 6 stars. <br />U can't see the 6th one, but u can definitely feel it can't u :)   <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This is a great movie, and it was shipped to me fast. Excellent Job, and Thank you.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Before seeing this film, I'd read Anthony Swofford's Desert Storm memoir, \\"Jarhead,\\" and found it moving, thoughtful, compelling, funny, and beautifully written. The performances and the photography in the film go a long way to capturing the time and place of Swofford's story and portraying the particular culture that is specific to the U.S. Marines. But overall, I found that it paled significantly by comparison with the book.<br /><br />The commentaries on this DVD and the many deleted scenes are a lesson in what happens when a book-length narrative gets squeezed like toothpaste into 90 minutes of linear movie storytelling. Interesting complexities get oversimplified, and film's literal immediacy minimizes more truthful ambiguities. What's missing in this film, for instance, is that Swofford's book is a 30-year-old's memory of himself as a 20-year-old. Those ten years make a big difference in the way he tells his story and what he chooses to tell us. He also interweaves many more threads and connects many more dots for readers.<br /><br />More mystifying is the wish of the filmmakers (as explained in the commentaries) to make the character of Swofford's friend Troy more ambiguous by withholding information about him. Their friendship is central to the book, yet the film makes a puzzle out of it. At the end, the film doesn't even tell us what has happened to him.<br /><br />See the film, if you keep in mind that it asks us to settle for a lot less than what Swofford originally wrote. This doesn't make it a bad movie, just a reminder of what the printed word can achieve in the hands of a fine writer. Oh, and read the book.
0553573403|2.0|Why is it that some fantasy writers feel the need to have ridiculously bad, over-the-top villains pitted against really likable characters and then inflict so much pain and anguish on the latter?  It's formulaic and predictable (gee, I wonder if the \\"bad\\" people will get their comeuppance in a later book?)<br /><br />My other problem with this novel is it's lack of really original ideas.  Sure, all literature borrows from and expands on previous literature.  This book, however, seems only a partially disguised regurgitation and remix of ideas from other fantasy books (especially Robin Hobb's Farseer series).<br /><br />Consequently, I was, in turns: frustrated, annoyed, bored and depressed. Like a long bus ride, I couldn't wait for it to be over. No thanks, Mr. Martin, I'll get off here.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|amazing writing, amazing acting. Fast paced, fun and touching. This show is a gem that shines. It should never have been cancelled. It is a show that one can watch over and over again and never get tired of seeing. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I love, love, love this CD.  I always liked U2, but now, after all these years I am a \\"new\\" fan.  This album gets better and better the more I listen to it.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Rocksters Steely Dan have always steered the ship of rock n roll mixed in with crooney words and titles. When a Steely Dan artist goes solo, the ship might go a different direction... yes, The Nightfly was a little different from Steely Dan material... then again it wasn't.  <br />   Several years later, and third solo delivered, Donald Fagan brings in another winner but more closer to Steely Dan material than ever! Nothing wrong with that though. No signs of Becker around but the quality seems as if he's still there.  <br />   \\"Morph the Cat\\" track 1 opens the album with Steely Dan magic, giving us a clear view of what's to come- even sounds like Two Against Nature opening. His toleration for New York City lifestyles is evident here. \\"It's kind of like an artic mindbatch. Cool and sweet and slightly rough. Liquid light on New York City. Like Christmas without the chintzy stuff.\\" Walt Weiskopf delivers a classic Tenor Sax solo on this track! <br />   Track 2's \\"H Gang\\" is a very enlightning tale of a five-chord band. Calm tune, nice chorus that would flatter Gary Katz back into the studio.  <br />   Track 3's \\"What I Do\\" is Donald's dedicated-wave to Ray Charles. Appropriately, a soulful tune mixed in with harmonic <br />sessions. A complex song in the Fagen/Steely Dan catalog and successfully achieved here as blues and funk are clearly evident. <br />   Track 4's \\"Brite Nitegown\\" depicts a tale of terrible luck and forseen death. Very jazzy, tasteful tune here! Nice back up vocals by Michael Harvey that adds plenty to the chorus. Sax sessions are done just right while Donald slams the fender smoothly. An album highlight! <br />   Track 5's \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" is love explained in aged times. Really a gripping song from an emotional Fagen, delivered from \\"Aja\\" studio-sessioned style. Crisp and even a touch of \\"Kamakirad\\" sounds are evident.  <br />   Track 6's \\"Security Joan\\" is a funny tale of inconvient security lives in New York City. Told right with awisp of rockin jazz. Almost could've been an excused tune from the \\"Gaucho\\" sessions! <br />   Track 7 brings \\"The Night Belongs To Mona\\" and her depression trials. Crafty song, bringing in the dark-aged Steely Dan flavor of strange people deeling with strange issues. Bass Clarinet from Roger R. was a winning touch while Fagen steels the show away from most cued soloing instruments.  <br />   Track 8's \\"Mary Shut The Garden Door\\" is brief and to the point. Still delivered with a soothing approach. Good line up of instruments on the end of this one.  <br />   Track 9 reprises \\"Morph the Cat\\" and jumps right into it reminding us of his love for Manhattan. Probably a winner for the album, \\"Morph the Cat\\" seems to please all as his trademark style of Steely Dan-approaches are visible here while dabbling in his personal life with the tale of Morph.  <br />    Not up to the levels of a Donald Fagen solo project where some instruments are missing from a typical classic. The pace is friendly through out as all nine songs are almost relatively close. However, this could be Donald Fagen's most personal work to date and who knows what musical sessions are appropriate for Morph the Cat. Moreover, the tempo isn't really threatened either; if too much elaberation in mixed sounds were installed, the focus on Fagen's new approach may have been lost.  <br />    A great album from Fagen and everything delivered with a Steely Dan aspect as well. Very well balanced with tales and talent. This could still test out any Bose sound system along with his other albums. Definitely a bold installment into his chapters of music as his aging storys are expressed throughout, expressing interest in life, love and death. The horrible aspect on terrorism poked at in \\"Security Joan\\" to the securing loves in life of \\"The Night Belongs To Mona,\\" Morph The Cat will remain a winner in any catelog of strong music. <br />
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I didn't like this movie.  I lost interest about halfway thru because it was showing each \\"chapters\\" backwards, starting at the end and finish at the beginning, but I finished it though.  No suspense this way because the movie will reveal the answer at the beginning.  Good thing I rent it for $1.00.
B00005JO9J|4.0|This season, good as it was, suffers from the first season uncertainty all good shows have. It is still finding its voice, deciding if the sex lives, the ambition, or the personalities of its charachters will come first. It is a good watch, though; very enjoyable, and necessary to understanding what is going on now. Worth buying.
B00005JOE8|5.0|I found this movie to be intelligent and engaging.  The characters were fascinating, and my only real problem with the movies is that many of them were never really developed or revealed. <br />  Several people have mentioned to me that they were outraged that V, the main character, was glorified erroneously, that that the movie glorifies terrorism.  While any person who fights a government with violence might be billed as a terrorist (especially by said governement), V seems to focus all of his retribution on members of, and symbols of the facist regime.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid harm to civilians, and it is that tie to his essential humanity that sets him apart as more than just a terrorist. <br />  The dialogue and cinimatography in this movie were beautiful, and I found the story's intelligence a breath of fresh air after the parade of tripe that Hollywood had inundated me with lately.   <br />  While some of my conservative friends rail against this as anti-bush/republican, and my liberal friends hail this as a return to the sixties, I find myself disagreeing with both sets.  This movie targets totalitarianism and intolerant governments more than any one specific regime, and I found the anti-establishment message harkened far less to the marijuana hazed sixties sentiments than to the American revolutionary war. <br />  The message was delivered masterly, and while the movie had its share of violence, it was delivered with tasteful effectiveness instead of the sensory saturation 'gross-out' that marks the average modern action movie. <br />  This is a movie that will hopefully make you thoughtfull, and act as a warning to the dangers of doing nothing and allowing any government or group to manipulate you with fear.  If you leave a theater having been not only entertained, but intellectually stimulated I consider it time well spent. <br /> <br />  Give it a try...
B0006399FS|2.0|Two songs on this CD get air play and it's obvious why (their good!). Unfortunately the rest of the CD lacks the same fire. There is little difference between songs and Bono's off key drone makes me wonder what happened to the guy that gave us albums like Joshua Tree...  <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I first read Pride & Prejudice at the ripe old age of 9.  In the last 45 years I have read and reread all of Austen's works many times and can be considered something of an Austen authority.  It is risky to try to translate a written work so well known and loved as Pride & Prejudice to a visual medium, but there are folks who can't resist the challenge.  I've seen a few other attempts and must  praise the 2 disc BBC version (with Colin Firth et al) for its beauty and adherence to the text.  Others criticized it for not being as good as much older versions.  Some even faulted that the principals were not sufficiently beautiful or handsome. <br />   <br />Comparatively, I felt this film was much more true to the 'facts' set forth in the text, if not to the text itself.  The Bennett women were  appropriately young.  The younger ones were in character and giggly.  Mr. Darcy seemed a bit young to me--not convincingly 30, but very convincingly reservewd.   <br /> <br />I fully expected to be critical of this effort, and couldn't see how anyone could have another view of the story worth putting forth. s But these producers and writers don't pretend to be true to Austen.  They shift the perspective to her characters.  This P & P shows life more as it might have been in the times about which Austen wrote.  Fans of regency romance are familiar with the term 'crush' as in, \\"The ball was expected to be the usual crush\\" (of people).  The dance sequences and balls evoke that very well. Portrayals of home life are also very much more 'realistic'.  Costumes are not as elaborate or as varied.  Sets are more believable--these are interiors to match the status of their owners.  And the sets and scenes and costumes do not draw attention from the actors' work.  The camera focuses on the characters and their facial expressions. <br /> <br />This version humanizes the characters:  The men are not smooth sophisticates.  The women are not either buffoons or sophisticates.  The mother's relations with her daughters are more maternal than is evident in other versions or in the original text.  And in this film, the father is a much more sympathetic figure -- more in tune with his wife (foibles nothwistanding) and children.  It is clear he cares for them even as he feels clearly outnumbered by all these women.  But he is not bad tempered about it. Nor does he feel he has made a mistake in marrying a young woman with more beauty than good sense. The Neterfield ball shows him comforting the daughter he had to discipline, and coming to his wife's aid to fan her in the crush of guests. <br /> <br />Most all the men come across as males (a common criticism of Austen's portrayals of men is she has no concept of the real thoughts or behaviors of men)--Collins is sexually frustrated, Bingley is tongue tied, and Darcy of course is smoldering, but his shyness comes across more clearly than in any previous portrayals, including the text.  It overrides his hauteur. <br /> <br />In short, I didn't plan to like this.  As an Austen fan I should feel outraged at the rewriting of so many of her characters and the cutting out altogether of others.  But where this movie does not imitate art, it does infuse life into the tale and its characters.  The departure was a very bold move and a risky one.  It works.  For that reason alone it deserves 5 stars, but it is also a lovely effort.
B0002OERI0|4.0|American Idiot delivers a good mix of mainstream (top 40) along with a tinge of alternative style music. The majority of the CD is worth a listen with definite distinction between tracks.
B00009NDAF|3.0|This book is the kind that will leave you confused, if the agenda is not set right at the very beginning. This is a book about how to run a profit making business with the most important, if not the only, benchmark being increasing shareholder value.<br /><br />And if that is indeed the agenda, this is a most remarkable insight into the topic. Gerstner is succinct, detail-oriented & very analytical. He brings to the pages of this book a text book like quality when it comes to managing corporate efficiency, managing the brand, & like he \\"modestly\\" points out many-a-time, managing crisis. There were multiple directional changes during his tenure at IBM - & each of these constitute a lesson in management, or at least a very well argued point of view - & all of these decisions are very well covered in the book.<br /><br />The book has a easy chatty style - clear communication & no academic hyperbole. Certain times, Gerstner's sense of drama comes across a bit too blatantly for the kind of readership this book might have. It also reads as if Gerstner was the only one transforming IBM during his time, outside of lame credits interspersed, & the \\"I\\" factor is evident.<br /><br />I'm in no position to validate if IBM is a better, more stable company because of Gerstner. One of his biggest successes, I understood from reading the book, was transforming IBM from a product (or a Mainframe) company to a Services company. In doing so, Gerstner certainly did exemplify tremendous thought leadership & trend spotting capabilities - however, to believe in Gerstner's success at IBM, you'll, first & foremost, need to believe in his benchmarks for success.<br /><br />S!
0743201140|5.0|This book was exceptionally helpful in both determining one's own strengths, based on the assessment referenced in the book, and in learning how to interpret one's own results and the results of others. It is particularly helpful in the guidance it provides with regard to the effective management and promotion of others. A key component of effective leadership these days is the understanding of the strengths of others and how employees and companies can benefit from this knowledge and application in the work environment.
0811821846|5.0|I gave this cookbook to my young son the Star Wars freak as a birthday gift. I really wasn't expecting much from it, other than generating a few chuckles at the Star Wars birthday bash. Several months down the road, I am proud to report that we have tried a half dozen of the Wookiee Cookies recipes. My picky eater now enjoys Twin Sun Toast for breakfast, and we've had great success with Princess Leia Danish Dos. The \\"Leias\\" are my personal favorite! They are made with pizza dough and so are a bit heavier than most danish, but are nevertheless delicious and easy to make! Most of the recipes are typical foods given a SW name, but they are all kid friendly and simple to prepare and serve. My children have been asking to help in the kitchen much more often since this book came into our home! The book includes a few of each category: breakfast, beverages, snacks and sides, main courses, and desserts.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I am a VERY LATE arriving Rufus Wainwright fan.  I didn't get into Rufus until last year (2005).  I heard of Rufus and saw some of his music videos before.  I thought they were alright, but not very exciting.  (I also thought he was pretty cute.)  Then I borrowed \\"Poses\\" from the public library last year and now I'm hooked!  My favorite songs are \\"Greek Song\\" and the title track.  I also love the Francais on \\"Rebel Prince.\\"  I now have three of his albums (I'm missing Want One).

B00006D295|5.0|I have shown this around and found that many of my friends used to go to see this as a cult thing.  I am going to try to see if I can start a new viewing audiance with this DVD.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|This is a perfect film.  Never has the topic of love between two men been so perfectly and accurately depicted.  The short story by Annie Proulx is heart wrenching, the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana is sensitively developed into a complex exploration of self damage and collateral damage as a result of repression and isolation and Ang Lee brings that screeplay to life never pulling any punches.  The actors, Health Ledger, Jake Gyllenhall, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams, perfectly embody their characters and make them real; we know these characters; we are these characters.  Brokeback Mountain is an accurate depiction of the terror and heartbreak of gay love as a result of society's mores and the unavoidable result of self hate and its consequences.  This film will go down in film history as one of the best films ever made.  It is that good.
0441172717|5.0|OVERALL COMMENTS: Science fiction of the highest quality.  A classic masterpiece that stands the test of time. <br /> <br />PLOT: Dune is set in the distant future on a planet called Arrakis - the only planet known to contain an addictive mineral, referred to as spice, that prolongs human life.  Different factions are in a longstanding battle to control the mining and sale of the spice.  As these battles rage on, victory awaits those that seek to understand the environment and ecology of this strange and hostile planet.  The native humans, an intensely religious and adaptive group of survivors, lie in wait for a prophesized leader to take them to victory over the invasive and disrespectful factions.  A high-born son must learn his true potential as a leader and mental superior in order to save his royal bloodline and the future good of Arrakis. <br /> <br />PROS: Excellent writing.  Touches on environmental issues.  Intricate plot.  Creative futuristic visions.  Convincingly explores the concepts of highly advanced mental abilities. <br /> <br />CONS: At times, fate and prophesy way heavily on the story making it seem more of a mystical fantasy world than a hard-core sci-fi book. <br /> <br />PERSONAL NOTE: As someone who saw the movie first, it took me a while to get around to reading the book, since the movie was confusing and creepy (at least for me as a kid).  But, as is usually the case, the book is far superior to the movie and reveals so much more.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I enjoyed this disc in the car and at home.  A new classic.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|<br />   This is the best album in my opinion for this German band. They play wonderful music, with great hooks and melody, also with a little fun in their lyrics. So, if you like Iron Maiden and Helloween, this is for you!!!

1592401791|5.0|Finally, a Beatles book from an insider who has no agenda, no axe to grind!  In case you don't know who Geoff Emerick was, he was the man responsible for the sound of the Beatles from 1966 onwards, from their Revolver album to Sgt. Pepper (called by many the two greatest rock albums of all time) to their final record, Abbey Road.  I knew that he had done those records with the group, helping shape their new psychedelic image, but what I didn't know was that he had also worked with them on many of their earliest records, too, things like I Want To Hold Your Hand and She Loves You.  And he was only 15 at the time!   <br />What an incredible story, and it's told really well too, and with admirable honesty.  There's no dirt dishing here, like so many other Beatles books, but there is a refreshingly candid look at the personalities involved.  George Martin didn't do everything he claimed he did, and John wasn't really the leader of the band, not in the studio, anyway -- Paul was.  Ringo was as good a drummer as we always thought he was, but he was also very quiet and tended to say little, though when he did come up with a comment, it was usually a gem.  Emerick's portrait of George Harrison is perhaps the most interesting one.  Harrison apparently wasn't all that great a guitarist in the early days, at least not when the red Recording light came on (don't forget, he was only 18 when Emerick first heard him play), but he got better and better as the years went on, and it's fascinating to see the way he grows in stature in Emerick's eyes as the band get further along in their musical development.  By the end, you can tell that Emerick has almost as much admiration for him as he does for the \\"musician's musician\\" Paul and the ever-mercurial but phenomenally talented John. <br />I had a blast reading this book, and it got me to get out all my old Beatles records and give them a spin one more time... only this time, knowing the stories behind the making of them, I heard all those classic recordings with new ears. <br />A great read, and a lot of fun.  Highly recommended!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I've recently had to reogranize my movies into two sections: those I watched before \\"Fight Club\\" and those I watched after. To explain the profound effect the film has had on me would be herculean, but I will do my best. The movie's stinging social commentary and dark humor left me bemused, shocked, and waxing philisophical. For the story of \\"Fight Club\\" is not as simple as the title would imply. It is not a meaningless movie of underdogs and champions, nor is it a blood bath. It is a brilliant, blunt, and beautiful re-examination of all we've come to believe. Clearly, it is not a film to be watched for kicks on a Friday night; it should be saved for when one is in a serious mood. The story is captivating, thought-provoking, and--at times--hillarious. It does not give us a cookie-cutter moral, but rather, leaves the viewer to draw his own conclusions. With raw, believable, and unforgetable characters perfectly portrayed by actors including Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, \\"Fight Club\\" will shake you, shock you, and provide you with hope and a new look on life.
B000002G23|5.0|It's got EVERYTHING!! A MUST for every Police fan!  <br />Plus, It's got REALLY nice photo's, a short bio for each band member, as well as an informative, chronological bio on the evolution of the band between the years: 1976- 1986. <br />A very nice compact set worth buying.
1400062756|3.0|I thought I understood the concept of mindset this book however, gave me a new outlook on many points I had forgotten and provided ammunition for helping others to understand mindset.  It provided a number of good examples that exposed my own \\"fixed\\" mindset in some areas and gave me the tools to change to a growth mindset, where I want to change, of course.  It was a valuable read that I finished over the weekend.  I gave it 3 stars because it continued to lack (like many books are now) concrete steps that could be followed to assist in changing the mindset.  I know the principles were there, just not in a clear manner.  I have already begun using this book with my nephew to help him come out of his fixed mindset.  Well worth the twenty-three bucks!
B000078DOH|5.0|Don`t listen to such people who say things like \\"they hadn`t really found their groove\\" or such nonsense. This is Chili Peppers, and what they stood for in the early days, and it was ORIGINAL! UNIQUE! The Peppers did \\"find their groove\\" After their 3rd album Uplift Mofo, and it was gradually downhill from there. The high experimentation and so-called lack of cohesion of these albums is the very thing that makes them Totems of music. What they did here was 100% unadultered expression with great variety. These 3 first albums are their finest work, all 3 masterpieces! Get them!

B00005UEAR|4.0|This is my first experience with DT.  I found them by accident on XM Music Lab.  There is such a difference between the two discs.  The first is absolutely fabulous.  The more I hear it the more I appreicate the talent.  These guys are very special.  I figure DT is a mix of Metalica, Rush and Return To Forever.  The execution is what is most impressive to me.  The singing is a bit weak, but the instrumental ability of the other band members is something to behold!
0307276902|5.0|I read this book with no preconceptions. I just saw it in a book shop, flicked through, bought it on spec. I'd not heard the hype, hadn't seen the Oprah Show, had never heard of the author or the book. Was attracted by the cover. <br /> <br />I read it virtually in one sitting, stayed up way past my normal bedtime to finish it. Was profoundly struck by some of the thoughts and philospohies in it. First reaction was 'what an amazing book'. <br /> <br />Naively presumed that it was probably mostly true, 'til I went web surfing to find out more and read all the stories about how he made up most of it and embellished other bits and that he's just some poor little rich boy who is using the trauma of things that didn't happen to line his pockets. Even though there is a bit of me that does feel let down that it's more fiction than fact, I don't think it's fair to write off the book and the thoughts in it just because the facts aren't there to back it up as non-fiction. <br /> <br />I've just read several reviews that absolutely slate the book and say that it's full of cliches, paints a totally unrealistic picture of addicts and would have you believe that they're all violent, scarred, dirty street people. All I can say is, in the book I read that wasn't the message I got. The picture I saw from reading it was that addicts come from all walks of life, for any number of reasons all the way from the cliches of escape from mental and physical childhood abuse (and don't forget that they may be viewed as cliches but that doesn't mean they don't happen in reality) to the most mundane and pointless gentle slide from boredom and experimentation to dependancy. And that a criminal dealer/addict addict on crack and heroin in some ways is no different to a middle class career driven alcoholic. And that the pschology of addiction itself is not terribly well understood and that treatment success rates are not very high. And that maybe encouraging belief in addiction as an incurable illness is not helpful to everybody. <br /> <br />As your average middle class non-addicted Brit, all I can say is, fact or fiction, it seems much more balanced than half the reviews slating it. And I still think it's an amazing book.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The hero/villain, known only as V, is a modern `rendition' (pun intended) of Guy Fawkes, the man who was captured, tortured, and confessed his part in attempting to blow up the British Parliament building in 1605.  V recites the following poem amongst many others throughout the movie:  \\"Remember Remember, the 5th of November, Gunpowder Treason and Plot.  We see no reason, why Gunpowder Treason, should ever be forgot!\\"  However, the movie is neither a justification for the Catholic rebels of 400 years ago nor a condemnation of the King James administration, which was also a target of the Gunpowder Plot.  Perhaps I can best summarize V for Vendetta as an examination of the proper place in this world of those who would say, \\"We need hope, not buildings\\" or \\"Ideas are bulletproof.\\"  Are such idealists too dangerous to be tolerated?  Do natural rights or even constitutional rights prohibit pre-emptive prosecution of thought crimes?<br /><br />Political philosophy is always a mix of the real and the ideal.  So what better venue than a comic-book inspired movie to provoke more questions than I could even enumerate in a simple movie review--questions concerning the role of citizens, the power of government, the justification of violence, retribution, toleration, propaganda, etc?  Moral issues presented in V for Vendetta range from unquestionable acknowledgement of the existence of evil in dystopian government controllers to more relativistic and difficult-to-grasp concepts that many viewers might never have even doubted before watching this movie.  Then again, much of what you take from this movie will depend on ideals you hold going in.  If you are only looking for narrow applications to specific current events, you will find them.  But if you limit yourself to such analogies, you will be missing out on the abundance of vital topics presented this movie.<br /><br />A student of Zen training methods may appreciate the direct personal experiences that Evey (Natalie Portman) must endure, while other may resent them.  One familiar with Eastern concepts of `Self' may not be so concerned that V never removes his mask or rarely even his gloves throughout the entire movie.  The Self is no more a face or flesh and bones than a State is its capital building, is it?  An Existentialist may have a better appreciation for the ultimate freedom of overcoming fear and saying, \\"No\\" even to ones own existence when the alternative is decidedly intolerable.  If you appreciate philosophy in general, or political philosophy more specifically, or if you've enjoyed books like We, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, or Brave New World, you will enjoy V for Vendetta.  But of course no prior knowledge is required to enjoy this action-packed and thought-provoking movie.  I suspect it will stimulate many discussions and perhaps even an interest in further reading.ortman) must endure, while other may resent them.

The charm is in the 'tatty' old fashioned glitz
1932100385|5.0|I read this book after seeing it cited in various articles and other works.  It is stunning, provocative, and frightening.  Campbell offers a copiously-researched argument that animal-based foods are the foundation for most of our diseases of affluence:  heart disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, etc.<br /><br />Like it or not, the research is compelling.  Animal protein \\"feeds\\" these diseases.  Elimination of animal-based food stops and eventually reverses many of these diseases.<br /><br />This is not a \\"fad diet\\" book.  Dr. Campbell is a nutrition scientist and has been studying the effects of diet upon disease since the 70s.  The China Study represents one of the most expansive and statistically valid studies of diet that has ever been produced.<br /><br />I am amazed that it has received so little attention--yet in the latter half of the book Campbell explains that phenomenon.  The China Study represents a threat to the common approaches to western medicine:  surgery and drugs.  It is also a threat to the politically powerful dairy and meat industries (the very ones who are often sponsoring \\"nutrition\\" education in our schools). A lot has been invested in convincing the public that meat and dairy are good for us--so, much (money) could be lost with the China Study's conclusion that these are the very foods that are killing us.<br /><br />I have watched both my parents suffer and die of cancer, one of my grandmothers died of Alzheimers, one grandfather died of colon cancer, I have a relative with lupus and I've been unofficially diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.  This is the first time I've been told that there is hope for dealing with these diseases--a hope that involves changing diet rather than enduring years of drugs and/or surgery.<br /><br />Let's see then, big decision on the menu:  cheeseburger with a big helping of disease or veggie wrap (hold the mayo) with a healthy dose of hope.  Food for thought, indeed.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is so cool! I like it way more than Enterprise and I will rank it close to Star Trek.  I keep watching the espisode \\"Ariel\\" because of how it shows the way the characters think.  This series hits on issues that are close to home and are truely real.  The series may be fiction but the characters themselves are truely real, I mean you can connect to them.  That is something that is becoming rare in the ScFi world.  They should never have taken this off the air!  If this series is re-instated, I will do whatever it takes to watch it!
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden was one of the most remarkable tales of betrayal, brotherhood, and just simply finding \\"yourself\\". John Steinback is a wonderful author and he caught me almost from the start with this book.  <br />Most of all, I really enjoyed Steinback's style of writing. Just the way he writes makes you want to read more. First, there is Cathy, when you read about her it's almost like she is right there next to you. Growing up as a whore, she gets lost within strange thoughts, and is almost \\"devilish\\". After murdering her parents in a house fire, which was only the start of her terror, she runs off and isn't heard of for a long time. <br /> Then there is Adam, an almost robotic man, who isn't alive or dead. He just exists. He is very much in love with Cathy and his life revolves around her. She has other ideas though. She cheats Adam on their wedding night and leaves him after her twin boys are born.  <br />The two brothers relationship is also a very good example of Steinback's writing. They have a very realistic care towards each other. They would get a long very well, then get in a massive fight and one would leave. <br />Throughout the book, it was easy for me to \\"paint a picture\\" of exactly what is going on Whether it be the setting or characters, it was all very vivid.  <br />The only downside for me was I had a difficult time getting into the book and following it at the beginning. But, honestly, once you start getting what is going on you won't be able to stop reading it. So that was the only thing I didn't like because it was a REALLY good book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting into books with style, great characters, and close to the realistic events that happen in life. <br />
0553213105|5.0|There seems to be a tendency to interpret the works of Jane Austen in political terms (Jane Austen and the State, Jane Austen and the French Revolution) which overlooks the question of gender and class conventions in Austen's novels, which go to establish the comic tone they bear so well. The critical introductions for Pride and Prejudice in both World's Oxford Classics and Penguin, by Isobel Armstrong and Vivien Jones respectively, do follow this trend and tend to overlook the rigours of feminist criticism, as appeared in Marilyn Butler's Jane Austen and the War of Ideas. As a post-revolutionary romance, Pride and Prejudice provides a reflection of political events, but this theme is only secondary to the critique of class and gender conventions, and which is only indirectly related to political conditions.<br /><br />The use of silence, or the withholding of information, as a narrative strategie to produce the complications in the plot that go to make up the story, follows from this indirect association. Another important theme in the novel is the difference between public and private space. The exchanges of information (gossip, if you may) between the characters, particularly between Elizabeth and her relatives and friends, reveal a society in which individual worth and reputation is decided by rumour. When rumour is too strong, this is, shared by many, it may not be worth one's while to attempt to change it even if it is found to be false. It is for this reason that Wickham is allowed to fulfil his mania for elopement and achieve a suitable marriage.<br /><br />It is no surprise that a society so concerned with opinion should be given to prejudice, this is, the conversion of uninformed unfavourable opinion into a general judgement. Prejudice is by no means to be seen as a privilege of the aristocratic class. The community at Longbourn are seen to be equally capable of misjudging and misrepresenting character, in particular Mr Darcy's.<br /><br />Elizabeth's onearistocratic feature in her character is her general dissatisfaction with everything she sees. Her critical gaze links her to the aristocratic crew that she meets and alienates her from her surroundings. But if she wants to become one with Darcy's \\"family party\\" it is precisely this quality that she is to tame. By looking at Pemberley's grounds, she learns to express her own (sensuous) satisfaction with things as they are.<br /><br />Elizabeth's sensual gaze has been educated through the novel in a process of humiliation and denial. It is when she accepts the humbling experience of Charlotte's wedding and goes to visit the Collins' that she learns to appreciate the stately fixity of Rosings and starts to give the appropriate steps to becoming Darcy's consort.<br /><br />In the words of Isobel Armstrong in the Oxford World's Classics \\"Introduction\\": \\"it is through the uncomfortable limits of sexual signals that the novel indirectly explores a  deep political question: when is it right to conceal or to reveal information; when isit right to speak out?\\" Nevertheless, this question is in the novel less political than gender and class- based.<br /><br />\\"Female elegance\\", according to Mr Collins, consists in \\"rejecting a man on the first application\\". Affectation is taken for granted among women, which poses a problem for women who, like Elizabeth, wish to decline a proposal in spite of their economic need. Twenty years had scarcely passed after the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, and it is characteristic of the peculiar genius of Jane Austen that she had already produced the first post-feminist heroine, a woman capable of turning the issue of marriage into an unselfish and pleasurable conquest - unselfish, because by marrying Darcy Elizabeth establishes her family socially, and pleasurable, because in accepting the stately home of Pemberley she fully reconciles herself to the sensuousness of life -.>      <br /> <br />

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you are already a fan of Joss Whedon's tragically-cancelled sci-fi TV series, \\"Firefly,\\" you don't need to read my review - you're probably already a devoted fan and know the movie and all TV episodes by heart.      If you're not already a fan of the aforementioned works and are considering whether to check them out, a few words of caution.  Diving into the TV series \\"Firefly\\" and this motion picture \\"continuation\\" \\"Serenity,\\" presents some risks.  Frustrated significant others will complain that you aren't paying attention to them anymore.  Friends will gripe that you didn't show up at the bar on Friday night.  You will have some sleepy days in the office because you stayed up to watch \\"just one more episode\\" the night before.  You may even find yourself cursing in Chinese when frustrated.      But these risks are worth the rewards of diving into Joss Whedon's futuristic universe.  \\"Serenity\\" builds on the foundation laid by the TV series, and while it's better if you've seen the series, it's by no means essential to understand \\"Serenity.\\"     River Tam is a young girl who is recognized as a prodigy at an early age.  So the sinister \\"Alliance,\\" who rules over the federation of planets that arose out of the world wars that wracked Earth, took her for nefariouis purposes.  Let's take one of God's great creations and make a weapon out of her!  Her brother, Simon, is destined to be a successful, brilliant wealthy surgeon, but he throws it all away to break River out of her government lab/prison.    This has consequences, not least being that the Alliance has more than a few nasty assassins at its beck and call.  Why kill River?  Because she knows Secrets that can harm the Alliance if the truth gets out (the Alliance likes to keep its People docile, ignorant, and tranquil).    Unfortunately for the Alliance, Simon and River are in need of transport, and the ship they find (a \\"Firefly\\"-class ship called \\"Serenity\\" - get it?) is crewed by folks who cannot under any circumstances be described as docile, ignorant, or tranquil.    Led by Capt. Mal Reynolds, the crew of \\"Serenity\\" is classic-Whedon:  lovable, sarcastic, witty, dangerous, and just-a-mite scruffy.  Reynolds is a survivor of the last band of rebels who took on the Alliance and lost, and let's just say he carries a grudge and a few chips on his shoulder.  The rest of the cast has its own sets of idiosyncrasies and lovable traits . . . this is a cast of fully-realized, three-dimensional characters.    One of the disadvantages you have when a TV series is adapted to the Big Screen is scope.  While the budget is bigger, the special effects better, and the writing often amazing, you still just don't have the luxury of time that you do in a series.  You have to make hard choices -- what story are you going to tell, and which characters do and do not fit into that primary story?  As a result, some beloved characters from the series are relegated to more supporting roles -- they get their moments, to be sure, but little more.    For a well-written story, this is not a bad thing, just unfortunate.  Fortunately, Whedon and his team are great writers, so even the little moments for the \\"supporting\\" characters are a riot.  But the story does focus primarily on two characters -- Mal and River.  In \\"Serenity,\\" Mal is a bit darker, a bit more scarred than he was in \\"Firefly.\\"  Sure, he's got his trademark wit, but we explore his pain (and his unending capacity for it) a bit deeper here.  And that's wonderful, because Mal is a great character.    We also see a lot more of River in the movie.  In the series, River's story was always hinted at, but you could see that her story was something the writers wanted to weave gradually throughout the series as it evolved.  So there were many episodes where we only got hints and snippets of River and her potential.  \\"Serenity\\" dives into her story with a belly flop, and believe me, it's one dark tale.    Grittier, edgier, and more violent than the TV series, \\"Serenity\\" is an excellent adaptation to the big screen of one of the little screen's greatest triumphs and tragedies.  Check it out, but don't say I didn't warn you.
B000002BYD|2.0|pearl jam was really in a horrible creative time for this album.. i seem to remember that the fans were mad at the band for not touring, and eddie vedder said \\"we can either tour or create new music.\\"  listening to this garbage, it's obvious he should have TOURED!  it's funny seeing all the positive reviews here.. i guess pearl jam fans will swallow any trash they put out, but i'm not a fan so i can view things objectively, as an alternative rock fan.  some of the songs here are so bad i'd think they were literally a JOKE if i knew there weren't meant to be serious, good songs.  a sense of lethargy reigns over most of the songs.  it's obvious the band was bored and probably didn't want to be playing music, or had nothing better to do at the time.  the ONLY bright spots on this album are the awesome \\"do the evolution\\" and \\"wishlist.\\"  \\"given to fly\\" is also a good song and there are a few decent others.  the rest is almost unlistenable it's so annoying and terrible.  maybe i can find a better pearl jam album, but this definitely isn't the one to listen to!
0553801503|1.0|Like everyone else that has written a review for this book I also loved the first three books in this series. Honestly, the best I have ever read. I tracked the progress of A Feast for Crows for years in excited anticipation. My wait has sadly been in vane...<br /><br />This book is a complete disappointment. All I see is an author or publisher or combination of both trying to make more money. Why would you, Mr. Martin, produce a book that is so obviously trying to drag out a story with endless/useless detail just so you can continue a series beyond necessity and earn a few extra dollars? Where is the want and desire to produce great literature? In my opinion, Mr. Martin came so very close to creating one of the world's best fantasy series but instead opted for greed and has ruined the potential. This book is a waist of time and I recommend no one read it.<br /><br />What a shame...
B000E6UK5K|1.0|David: Hey dear, I have some ideas for an album. <br />Polly: Oh, can I help? <br />David: Sure, write lyrics and we'll even bury your vocals in a couple of spots. <br /> <br />OK, maybe that is a little bit sarcastic, but unfortunately that is what this album reminds me of; a domestic happiness project. Of course the sound is Gilmour's, not Macca's, but the feel of mediocre, fluffy contentment is the same. Now there is no reason why someone as successful as Gilmour shouldn't be content and happy, and make an album reflecting the same. But looking in from the outside it's just dull and boring. The opening track has some promise, but for the most part it is all downhill from there. \\"The Division Bell\\" showed that Gilmour could follow his own vision and still come up with something with an edge to it, even if it was a different type of \\"edge\\" than Roger Waters'. But this album is not only edgeless (only \\"Take a Breath\\" has some life to it, and that track seems out of place consdiering how the rest of the album sounds), it also seems endless, as in \\"will this ever end?\\". <br />When one is \\"on an island\\" on a calm day one can stand on the beach and look out over a featureless expanse of sea that fades to the horizon. That is this album. <br />

B00003CWLF|5.0|This is an excellent movie which I have watched on numerous occasions and will watch many more times in the future.  Jodie Foster is excellent in her role.  The whole concept of the King falling in love with \\"1\\" woman when he had so many wives really touched me.  It was a true love story.
B00005JLEU|5.0|When am among friends and discuss movies and mention animation, many people I know switch off almost immediately. `Duh, animation?' and `I don't watch kids movies' are the most oft heard remarks. They are partly right of course - many animation movies do cater to kids and it is hard for adults to be enthused about them. But I suspect the real reason is because these are too predictable and have become formulaic. Take almost any Hollywood animation production these days and a common strand can be found among them - mind-blowing images and an ensemble of a righteous (and reluctant) hero, an amusing side-kick, a true blue villain and other cronies providing humor - all voiced by celebrities. The storyline is almost always the same - some destination to go to or a goal/adventure to be accomplished. And the dialogues, always full of pun, so much so that you almost long for some straight talk. After all, there can be too much of a good thing.  <br /> <br />As a breath of fresh air, comes Japanese animation from the famous studio `Ghibli' headed by Miyazaki who is renowned by many as one of the best living animators and one of the last practitioners of hand-drawn animation. Yes, no computers for him - he faithfully pens all the images that you will see in his movies. This movie is probably his masterpiece and deservedly won the Oscar in 2003 for the `Best animated movie'. <br /> <br />The movie is a coming-of-age story of a 10-year old girl, Chihiro. The story details how a little brat transforms into a responsible and hard-working girl. Miyazaki is also an environmentalist - he uses a few scenes in the movie to convey his message (a scene when a river spirit is cleansed by removing mud and other junk from within it is not for the faint-hearted, it may make you retch!). <br /> <br />Though the images do not have the depth of those in say - `Shrek'or `The Incredibles', they seem very fresh and one feels like s/he is seeing a faithful adaptation of comics on screen. Miyazakilingers on each vista and lets the viewer soak in the scenery. One sequence when Chihiro takes a train ride to an unknown destination will stay with me for a long time. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of animation and haven't seen this yet, I promise this will become one of your favorites. If you are not, I urge you to take a shot at this anyway. An LA Times critic sums it up best \\"it's got a magical air of once-upon-a-time, a fairy-tale quality reminiscent of the unexpurgated works of the Brothers Grimm\\".  <br /> <br />As for me, I watched this on a big screen TV when I was alone at a friend's place and truly felt that I experienced magic on screen.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|4 stars? I give this 4 stars because: <br /> <br />1) \\"On An Island\\" is a pink floyd song, even if it isn't. <br /> <br />2) \\"Pocket Full of Stones\\" is one of the most amazing mellow ballad songs I've heard in a while. It's somber yet not depressing somehow, even though it's classic 'place in this life' songwriting like DSOTM <br /> <br />3) \\"Take A Deep Breath\\" isn't very good. <br /> <br />4) Blue is good, except the whammy pedal is kind of distracting. <br /> <br />5) Listening to this album makes me want to float away on a cloud... <br /> <br />6) The repeated use of island / water imagery gets me inside, perhaps because I spent 20 summers on a small island in Lake Huron in northern Michigan and because it's a part of how I am... <br /> <br />7) \\"Red Sky at Night\\" has sax in it. Music today needs more saxophone.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: If you want something mellow, laden with classic over-bent blues guitar from David Gilmour, without hard rock tinges and with some shocking Pink Floydisms (well, not really shocking), buy this album.
B00005JOFO|5.0|After watching BBM only once and seeing so many men and women crying at the end, I have no doubt that this is a Greek tragedy in modern times. Aeschylus couldn't have done it better!! I have lived the 60's and know about the disdain that gay men suffered and not speaking of lesbians... Fortunately those times are gone.
B00005JNX0|3.0|I found this movie to be extremely boring, however as an adult I cannot say whether or not it would be entertaining for children.  I enjoyed Melman, he really made the movie get three stars,however the rest of the plot really never grabbed my attention.  Overall, I was expecting a movie as entertaining as Shrek, but Madagascar was far from meeting my expectations.

B00005JLIU|2.0|With the exception of a few songs and key lines I found this movie to be extemely disappointing in comparrison to the Broadway show.  In my opinion, Julie Andrews lacked the spunk that Millie's character required and Carol Channing was just horrible as Muzzy!  I do think Mary Tyler Moore was a very good \\"Miss Dorothy\\" and I was impressed by the dancing, much more so than the singing.  If you are wanting to purchase this as a reminder of the Broadway musical, I would recommend purchasing the CD of the songs from the show instead.

This album is jus more murder and 50 jus gettin to the point and exposin his enemies. 50 basically does a massacre on the whole rap industry which i think he did damn good.

B000BCKFWK|1.0|I remember when a friend of mine told me about a movie (I'm not going to say the name) in which one of the characters is a hitman and killed people with a smile in his face and adding a sarcastic and cynic remark and he didn't stand it because of that , he said, human life is a precious gift. I watched Sin City last night and I think  that it is one of the more violent trash-movies I've ever seen. Violence is always a bad thing but in this case is senseless and really stupid. Americans should realize that this country is one of the more violent in the world. People kills each other sometimes only for the pleasure of killing (think about the sniper in the Washington DC area 3 years ago) One of the reasons for this is what we see in the movies. And this movie is an example of that. Frank Miller is a mental-illed guy and his stories should be avoided at any cost. Don't buy or see this piece of garbage!

B00005JOE8|1.0|This movie had very entertaining action sequences <br />and excitement, if they would have left out all  <br />the agenda propelling preaching it would have <br />been quite entertaining.  It portrayed the  <br />homosexual relationship as the only truly <br />beautiful lifestyle, and was anti-Bush from the <br />word go, even portraying Bush as a tyrannical  <br />lunatic even willing to eavesdrop at will on any <br />human being having any conversation in any  <br />situation.  If anything they made the left look  <br />like they would accept anything, and the right  <br />look like they detested and wanted to destroy  <br />anything even to the point that they would fire <br />on un-armed civilians looking to overthrow the  <br />corrupt villainous regeme.  What is intresting <br />is liberals are the ones that want to dis-arm  <br />our society.  If you think my review is too  <br />political & etc.  Then you will hate this movie, <br />it is two hours of politics 101 from a  <br />perspective that I neither agree with, nor accept.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There have been many \\"Icons\\" in American music. Performers who have become a \\"Symbolic\\" to a certain time or era. The problem is that most performers don't have the talent to live up to the hype of being a symbol.<br /><br />  Johnny Cash was one of the exceptions. On his last album \\"Ameican IV: The Man Comes Around\\", Johnny Cash shows that when facing the ultimate enevibility, one must face it with dignity, compassion, thruth, tears, and a bit of humor. If you don't own a Johnny Cash album, buy this one and get an idea of what every fan already knew. If you are a fan but don't have this album, buy it. If for nothing else, just to know the fact that when The Man Comes Around for the last time, He still had purpose.

I don't give it 5 stars because it is just a tad sharper than my 28-105 canon lens. I do like the IS and the lens with it's USM motor is extremly slient. The IS does make a humming sound but it is hardly noticebly.
0385472951|4.0|It began when he disappeared.  But it didn't really start until they found him...<br /><br />The single best word used to describe John Grisham's The Partner would be unorthodox.  Unusual from beginning to end, this simple man-running-from-the-law story is so much more.  Just look at the beginning for example.  Typically, these types of stories begin with a crime and the plot follows the law breakers' run from the authorities, but Grisham's tale follows the convict once he is caught.<br /><br />Danilo Silva, a.k.a. Patrick Lanigan, is out running in the small town in Brazil where he lives when he is caught.  It seems Patrick, a young and promising lawyer, died four years ago in a car crash in Biloxi, Mississippi.  Not long after his death, 90 million dollars disappeared from his old law firm.  Lanigan was the prime suspect, but no one was able to track him down, until now.  Now Lanigan must work his way out of half a dozen legal battles or be convicted of, among other things, theft and murder.<br /><br />Not only is Grisham's intriguing tale full of plot twists and turns, but it is also impeccably written.  Pleasure-readers will enjoy his smooth, flowing story and appreciate the diction which enhances the story.  Even more seasoned literary buffs will recognize Grisham's mastery of the English language through his use of linguistic devices.  For example, the first chapter uses the anaphoric repetition of the word they to create excitement, anticipation, and anonymity.<br /><br />Overall, John Grisham's The Partner is an excellent piece of writing.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone and everyone.  It is a masterfully written novel with enough twists and turns to keep even the most stoic readers on the edge of their seats.
B00005NKKV|4.0|The reviewers who have canned this album (or at least some of its tracks) for sounding \\"dated\\" have overlooked what for me is its most endearing feature. The song that came in for the most serious bashing \\"We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin' Baby\\" is for me (after Sounds of Silence itself) the best song on the album. It's a perfect little slice of 1966 (and you can dance to it). One reviewer asked \\"who says 'groovy' anymore?\\"  Nobody, of course which is why the song is so priceless!
0671042858|5.0|'The woods have teeth!'... Anyone who has been lost in the woods (been there - done that) can identify with the chill down the spine, the streak of panic and all the scenes that play in your brain. For nine year old Trisha McFarland, the 'special thing' that sends a chill down her spine is far worse than just being lost, she's being stalked by something she never imagined was in the woods. It saves itself for those unfortunate souls lost and afraid.<br /><br />The little girl's radio gives her some escape from the terror, and her love of Tom Gordon and his pitching style helps pull her thoughts away from the creature she can sense is out there with her. As usual, the character details are great and I always stay up way too late with a King novel, so don't read it on a work night.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
0446530573|5.0|The Sporano's Family Cook Book is well presented in a large format, with great pictures and anecdotes to accompany some truly mouthwatering and authentic recipes. Non-cookery loving fans of the series will enjoy it, even if it only serves to give just that little bit more insight into the characters.  This book is certainly one for the shelf at home, and if you attempt cooking anything from this excellent product, it's just gotta be the chicken cacciatore for dinner and the eggs in purgatory for breakfast.  Bada-bing!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is another one of those classics that belongs on every shelf for children and grandchildren. I loved the lesson of 'life not being fair', for I often heard 'that's not fair' from my own child. The puppets and songs are great! Who wouldn't enjoy these unique 'goblins'. Be careful what you wish for. Maybe baby brothers aren't so bad...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B00004U2GH|5.0|Cash's San Quentin live album captures the essence of Cash,backed up by a great band,and June Carter even comes on for a couple of songs to the raucous strains of the San Quentin inmates.The in between song banter by Cash adds to the \\"Liveness\\" of the situation with extras and a great version of Ring Of Fire this is a must for true music fans.
0321344758|5.0|If you are interested in doing a good job at web design for your web viewers, you must read this book.  The information in it is extermly valuable.  It is also presented in a easy to understand and entertaining way which doesn't hurt!  If you are only interested in showing off your skills and don't care much about what your web users think, don't bother with this book.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|I just finished up creating a scrapbook on the movies of the 1960's and I got to admit no movie has gotten under my skin so much than \\"Blow-Up.\\" \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and \\"Barbarella\\" (also with BLOW-UP co-star David Hemmings) are close but \\"Blow-Up\\" takes the title. I'm very fortunate that I bought the DVD here and I will try to watch it. The film is on my list of the ten best films of the decade (it's at #4 while my #1 is \\"The Sound of Music\\"). The film broke taboos while the image of Vanessa Redgrave (love her green and blue plaid shirt and black scarf) holding her bare chest with her arms and with a dumbfounded look has to be one of the greatest movie images of all time (next to Shelley Winters chewing out Sidney Poitier and with her upper lip out to her nose in \\"A Patch of Blue\\" and Michael Caine pointing a shotgun while the camera is in a 45^ angle in \\"Get Carter\\"). The one thing that is really confusing the hell into me is how is Redgrave casted first? I may know the answer because I remember what Roger Ebert said in his review of \\"The New World\\" and that is the movie may be about the leading man but it's about the woman. Same thing here-\\"Blow-Up\\" may be about Hemmings' Thomas discovering a murder in his photos but the film is about Redgrave's Jane and that is: What happens when you are an innocent bystander and suddenly you're thrown into the crossfire and how many extreme measures will it take, including sex (which is what Jane does to Thomas) to get back your dignity? The movie was nominated for Best Director and for its screenplay but was not nominated for Best Picture. Imagine that: \\"Blow-Up\\" being nominated along with the other controversial taboo-breaking film \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" (the award went to \\"A Man For All Seasons\\" which oddly enough, has Vanessa Redgrave in a small role and it also had her brother Corin!) Above all, this movie has to be the next subject for AMC's brilliant show \\"Movies That Shook the World.\\" \\"Blow-Up\\" and \\"Movies ThatShook the World\\": Sounds like a perfect fit.     I just finished up this movie today. That was downright bizarre. There were two things that made my spin: One, the women in this film (Vanessa Redgrave, Jane Birkin, Gillian Hills) don't wear a bra or lingerie when they strip and Two, the last shot in which Thomas (David Hemmings) suddently disappears. That made me wonder: Was this story a dream and a nightmare or was he dead the whole time? (a la Bruce Willis in \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and when we see Thomas the first time he's coming out of a homeless shelter-a clue that he maybe an angel sent from heaven to find redemption or tour guide to London in the mid-60's). With these two moments it almost gave me bad British teeth just as what Richard Roper said recently on \\"Ebert & Roper\\" in his review of the British comedy \\"Keeping Mum\\" with Maggie Smith. Does anyone think Vanessa Redgrave (as Jane) looked like French actress Anouk Aimee with that brown bob wig? As for the murder scene and the dead body, can it be possible that the man is actually Thomas as an old man? Above all, \\"Blow-Up\\" has its moments; especially The Yardbirds scene.
078322737X|5.0|I watched this movie at the drive-in when I was in high school. It was a great movie then and it still is today. If you like hot rods this is a good movie to enjoy.
B00005JMXX|1.0|This is one of the worst mixes of \\"pseudo-science\\" and drama I have ever seen.  If you buy this DVD, you will be lining the coffers of some media mogul who couldn't care less for any type of accuracy...the movie is designed to scare you based on false meteorology and climatology studies.  You would be better off spending your money buying introductory texts on the subject.  Don't be fooled.  If you do buy it, see if you can pick up on the political statements floating just behind the main story line.  Al Gore probably directed this fiasco.
B000063TS9|5.0|I've highly enjoyed this brilliant collection of Shostakovich. Recommended to every music lover!
B000083C49|5.0|This movie is very well written, directed and acted....it is more about the human adventure (with its humor) as much as sci-fi.  It has it all excitement, humor,terror, oh yes did I mention humor?.  The main Star Trek cast really do enjoy acting with one another and it shows through out.  The DVD extras are well woth watching also.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I'd read all the reviews and hype but was pleasantly surprised and pleased that the movie surpassed all my expectations. Micky Rourke was amazing and while I'll watch anything with Bruce Willis, he too was exceptional. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000009SY|4.0|Zappa was known for writing perhaps some of the most intricate, complex, and frustrating pieces of music ever. Joe's Garage is no exception. As a whole, the album makes any musician salivate and shake his/her head, feeling humbled. A few tracks really stand out. <br />\\"Catholic Girls\\" has a crazy odd meter intro, that leads into a very suggestive tune. The odd meter intro, which I believe is in 9/8 or 9/16, is revisited after the second chorus, but this time with more tenacity, and it goes longer.  <br />\\"Fembot in a Wet T-shirt\\" is once again, an overly suggestive song. The highlight, for me, is after the second chorus, when there is a breakdown between drums and xylophone. Each is whizzing all over the place, confusing anyone listening. It was amazing. <br />Musically speaking, the biggest challenge was \\"Keep it Greasey\\". What starts off as a quick 4/4 groove segweys into a something almost never heard of: 21/16, one 1/16 note beyond 5/4. Who the hell has the gall to put that on an album? Zappa, and Zappa could do something so bold and get away with it. 21/16 goes back into 4/4, and the second verse is in 19/16, or so I was lead to believe. Vinnie Colaiuta is throwing in all sorts of little fills here and there, so the best thing to do hear is just let go and wait until the chorus kicks back in. The song ends with a five minute jam on that crazy 21/16 riff. <br />The only thing wrong with this album is that it is indeed Slow. \\"Keep it Greasey\\" feels like 15 minutes, seriously. Time itself seems to slow down when this album is on. Whereas it is indeed amazing, it is so in an excruciatlingly slow way.  <br />Regardless, any student of music must listen to this album.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode's \\"Playing the Angel\\" blows away both \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Exciter\\" by far. I think it's slightly better than \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". I'd say \\"Playing the Angel\\" rivals both \\"Violator\\" and \\"Music For The Masses\\" in both production, lyrics, sounds, and song arrangements/progressiveness.<br /><br />You'd have to be crazy not to love this album. It's a dark, brooding, gothic delight.
B00001IVR0|4.0|The Teutonic refinement of Wilhelm Backhaus has always been a veiled mystery. I knew from the profound admiration of Arrau for his pianism, thanks to a common friend who pitifully passed away fifteen years ago.<br /><br />Maybe you may agree with this kind of hard reflexive and granitic Brahms. In fact Clifford Curzon employs a similar approach in his well know and famous recording with Georges Szell. I think Brahms must sound less rational and much more visceral, according his beloved and well known finals in so many works of visible gypsy tunes. Brahms also possessed humor, but if you want to inject major conceptual resonance and underline a major emphasis on span, (as Klemperer did it with Beethoven, for instance), go for this one.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Even though I have yet to see the play, I am entralled by the music.  The voices are incredible and in particular the tracks, For Good and I'm Not That Girl are stellar in the vocal range of the performers! <br /> <br />Tickets are hard to get to the Broadway show, so listening to the music is a vicarious enjoyment!
0440241588|3.0|I was waiting for the action to start, but it never did.  I can say that the book held my interest, but the character were not developed enough.  Joe's family was hardly mentioned other than his one son who helped him by sending him a smartphone and some cash.  The people who were after him were just an after thought.  Mostly just a tour of Bologna Italy and listening to Joe learn the language.  What happen to the running broker on the cover???????  I expected more but like I said I actually did stay up until 2 AM to finish the book lucky it was a Saturday.
B000005RS6|5.0|Better than Made In Japan by any measure. Brilliant, seasoned, virtuoso musicians playing as a tight, cohesive unit. No noodling or other time wasting as on Made In Japan and other DP live recordings of that era. <br /> <br />The brilliant Morse/Lord duels rank among the best of the best; in fact any of the solos by these two rank among the best of the best. Morse breathed new life and enthusiasm into a great but declining band, prompting the attainment of new artistic heights.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I have to say, i bought this CD over a year and a half ago and still listen to it almost daily in my shuffle on my ipod. <br />Simply put, the more you listen to it, the more often different tracks become your favorite.  The favorites rotate but you never tire of any of them. <br />
0689859414|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this book.  It works perfectly with the chapter books, describing the characters and beautifully illustrating the fantasy characters so kids can relate to what they are reading.
B000E5N62U|5.0|The co-leader of Steely Dan has done it again! Donald Fagen has crafted another platter of fantastic, awesome-sounding, intelligent, skillful jazz/pop. A fabulous collection of \\"New York Stories\\" that only a master like Fagen can tell, including the gleeful cloud-spirit of \\"Morph The Cat\\" that descends upon the city folk and enriches their lives, the history of a popular New York band in \\"H Gang,\\" Donald talking to the ghost of Ray Charles in \\"What I Do\\", and a guy falling in love with an airport security girl (\\"Security Joan\\"). Fagen also tells an intriguing tale of Mr. Death himself (the fella in the \\"Brite Nitegown\\"). Killer grooves, hooks & performances, great lyrics and sound, and Fagen's cool vocals make \\"Morph The Cat\\" a total keeper. It's another truly great album from the truly great Donald Fagen. Thumbs up on this one, baby!
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I don't noramlly dedicate complete reviews to film scores, but the soundtrack to Memoirs of a Geisha is more than a score. It's a saga made of melodious sounds that represent loss, jealousy, pain and resurrection. The various notes are in deep conversation with each other creating a cacophony of musical bliss for our senses to enjoy.<br /><br />John Williams is a wizard in the magical land of music, and his wizardry has never been more evident. He truly captured the essence of the film with these bleeding yet graceful tracks. The same goes for Yo-Yo-Ma and his ever expressive cello.<br /><br />The violin has always been an instrument that moved me. It always seems very melancholic and tormented yet unrelenting and undeterred. I like to close my eyes and let it take me through unpredictable emotions and imagery. It's always an ecstatic experience.<br /><br />I especially like to listen to the violin echo the cello's or the string's sorrow, and at times, joy. There's plenty of those moments on this soundtrack.<br /><br />This score is an experience worthy of your attention. I can't recommend it enough.
0812550757|5.0|For those who are unsure about reading this book, I recommend reading Card's notes about how he came to write this book (in the version I read, this was an afterword). *This* is the book he wanted to write, and Ender's Game was really the prequel to it, to set up this story. The concept of a Speaker for the Dead may seem cruel to some, but again I recommend reading what Card has to say about it. <br /> <br />This book is certainly deeper and more philosophical than Ender's Game, but is still extremely interesting and has quite a human element to it. Card makes you really care about the characters and wants you to understand them and their actions. In all, it was quite a beautiful book and I was very moved by it. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have said that if you liked Ender's Game, you may not like this book. I think each book was excellent in its own way (and I thoroughly enjoyed each), though I can certainly see why someone might like one and not the other.   <br /> <br />I think the main contribution of this book is that it discusses how two completely different intelligent species might come to coexist, each with their unique society and views on what is just and ethical. It also considers the issue of how we humans should interact with a species that is less advanced than us, but is just as intelligent. In this story, the human government had decreed that there should be as little intervention as possible with the alien species, but is this always the ethical thing to do? <br /> <br />If these questions do not interest you in the slightest, you might not enjoy this book. Otherwise, I highly recommend that you read it. (And you probably need not have read Ender's Game first, just knowing the general plot is sufficient.)
B00005JOIF|4.0|Technically, the movie is superb with impeccable production quality and impressive direction. Politically, the movie was partial to the Israeli point of view, which is fine since it's told from the Israeli perspective. What bothered me about it, though, was the whole shpiel about negotiating with one's own morals and values to inflict pain and suffering upon others. The movie seems to show that only the Israelis go through this tough moral questioning while the Palestinians don't. I found that to be blatantly rediculous, wrong and irresponsible.<br /><br />The movie successfully shows the futility of conflict and the pain it continiously inflict on people's psyche and mental health. I especially liked how the Twin Towers were shown in the background toward the end as the Mosad operatives were negotiating carrying out another \\"elimination\\" operation against Palestinian leaders. The symbolism of it all was striking!<br /><br />All in all, it's a good movie. Rent it when it comes out.
0784011710|5.0|This haunting film is a faithful adaptation of William Styron's <br />novel.It very much deserved Roger Ebert's choice of the top <br />movie of 1982.Meryl Streep shows why she is considered the <br />best actress of her generation with her portrayal of the doomed <br />Sophie.This film also features the best dramatic performance <br />of Kevin Kline's career.It remains one of the most moving films <br />I've ever seen.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Christopher Eccleston doing ANYTHING is worth watching. SciFi can't broadcast these episodes fast enough!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I believe Jane Austen's initial tittle for the book on which this movie is based was First Impressions. To me that tittle better conveys the theme, that our first impressions of others are often grossly mistaken. Lizzy's first impressions of two of the men in her life were wrong. One for the better and one for the worse. My first impression of Lizzy was also wrong. At the beginning of the movie, I was disappointed to find Lizzy as a shallow, giggly girl looking to marry a rich man, but as the movie goes on (slowly at times) I was pleased to learn Lizzy was the complete opposite of my initial impression.
