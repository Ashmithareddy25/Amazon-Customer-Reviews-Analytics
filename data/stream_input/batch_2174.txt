B0010SKUYM|5.0|After Game of thrones I have been struggling to find something that grips both my attention and my imagination, this one does!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I was turned on to this series by a family member and ever since reading the first book, I haven't been able to stop! I recommend all the books to anyone needing something new to read!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Matthews uses a common sense approach to tackling weight/mass issues. After reading his book it was almost like I had a \\"duh\\" moment in that everything made absolute perfect sense. You'll see when you read it. He does a great job at explaining the little details of the diet and exercise program. I also feel that he actually does care about your results and is not just \\"in it for the money.\\" I've actually been able to contact him with questions on a few occasions and received punctual replies! He also checks up on me to see how I'm doing sometimes.<br /><br />I've been at it for four weeks and man... I've never looked or felt better in my life! I'm in the \\"cutting\\" phase, I was a 6'2'' male at 210lbs and looking pretty bloated but now I'm at 203lbs, 3.5 inches lost around my waist, and I can just now start to see some abs! I'm thrilled.<br /><br />I've tried atkins before (am ashamed to admit it) and had a terrible time trying to exercise and weight train, I always felt drained of energy and felt like garbage 24/7. This diet is so much easier, you can almost eat whatever you want, you just have to account for it.<br /><br />This diet is easy but does require some will power and determination to get through the \\"tempting\\" times (skipping a workout or cardio, eating something you're not supposed to) but if you can get through it, you will be ecstatic at the results.<br /><br />Thanks Mike!!!
1742200206|5.0|Make my schedules very easy and it has a lot of tips and promoction data that are great! Maps are great too !
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is pretty much one of the worst books I have ever read.  Sorry, but it's true.  It would stop anyone in their tracks from ever getting married for fear of ending up with psychos like this married couple.  I do have one positive thing to say.  It is a well-thought out novel, but past that I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is something you will really like or not like it at all.<br />I got hooked when my partner asked me to watch season 1
B001PPGAJY|5.0|Siempre un gusto ver esta pelicula, ahora mas que lo tengo en BR, buena calidad, buen sonido, que mas se puede pedir??
B003QTNFHW|5.0|It was fun and captivating. I had heard so much about it. It was definately everything I had heard and more.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|very good quality picture and sound.<br />good presentation of the material. the 3d version is incredible.<br />Images and colors from another world
B009CGCQPU|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie. I fell in love with the characters and their story. Keira Knightley is an excellent actress and I look forward to watching more of her movies.
B006H5120E|2.0|Very good presentation, and very good picture quality and sound<br />But the 3d disk I found unnecessary division on 2 disks
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Shows true everything for life love friendship companionship family lovers and great for people of all ages. Good job Nicholas.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Recomendadisimo a los amantes del cine, en especial del formato 3d.<br />Audio impresionante, imagenes increibles.<br />muy bien logrado, y sobre todo ,muy buena presentacion.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I am about one third through. I used to be a huge fan of king. So far, I am hugely disappointed. His succinct writing and vivid visualizations are not evident here. Needless to say, I am pretty sure this will be my last book by him.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This wasn't the best post-apocalyptic YA novel I've ever read, but it's up there in the (surprisingly long) list. Straightforward style, but with nicely nuanced characterizations, and a few thought-provoking surprises.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great detailed game. Beautiful graphics and ideas. My daughter loves it as do I. Recommend this free app to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The horse is cute. She is really loving and I have always wanted a horse but my dad is elergect to them so we couldn't get one.
1439153663|4.0|By the time I had read one-third of the way into this book I realized that more humans had died, been murdered, abused, or raped in its pages than in a similar length book about the history of the COMANCHES.  I thought, page for page, this is probably the *most* depressing book I'd ever read.<br /><br />I kept going, though, praying that the misery wasn't gratuitous, and that the author had a redemptive goal in mind for the constant onslaught of misery.<br /><br />Even having finished it, I'm not sure what the point was.  BUT, I give this book 4 stars and not 3 because despite my agony, the author's storytelling somehow encouraged me to finish it.  I am no purist about putting down a book I don't find value in, and yet this upsetting and seemingly pointless novel encouraged me to turn page after page.  Something about her descriptions of the people, I believe, their relationships, something about her descriptions of the south were very evocative for me, in a good way.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|i love it so much it is like my favorite but i have ben having troble with it and you have to buy 2 more packs if you want more things to create so yeah its a 3 star
B004GHNIRK|5.0|And if everyone read it - then we would all be able to start reading another book. So let's go. worth it.!!!
0385535147|4.0|THE RACKETEER is a return to the John Grisham storytelling of years (and years?) ago - lots of suspense, intrigue, and that can't-catch-a-breath reading sessions.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't remember the last book I've enjoyed from Grisham. Long ago, he became a \\"library only\\" author since I could never justify plunking down money for one of his books (discounted or otherwise). Even when someone gave me two of his more recent books I donated them to Goodwill.<br /><br />But THE RACKETEER is a keeper. I borrowed the book from the library, but will buy a copy for my kindle soon. It's worth re-reading. I really hope they turn this story into a movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|New the organizational part of my brain working. Some are easier than others but all are possible with patience. Enjoy
B0090P98Z4|5.0|A little god of war esque but enjoyable way to kill time in between class! I've already got my brother hooked on it too, you can't go wrong with free
B0098460O4|3.0|Recording doesn't have the excitement of the original &#34;Britain's Got Talent&#34; performance.  Expected brilliant sound but it was all somewhat flat.
0316023744|5.0|I think that Mr. Beevor did an excellent job of compressing a lot of history.<br />At 78 years old I remember some of the events which helped to hold my attention.<br />His insights into characters were very helpful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hope there would be more books in the series!! Whenever I read this I get hungry for Capitol food.
0345803485|1.0|After reading through five chapters I could not bring myself to continue. I am  now very suspicous of the all the positive reviews that the series has recieved.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|i loved lep's world and now lep's world 2 is turned up to new levels love the new graphics.  its a must have game. 5/5!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartwearming and heartbreaking at the same time. A breezy read with a substantive impact.  Everyone ages 14 and above should read it to learn about life, love and compassion.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Love the upgrades and power ups great job guys<br /><br />Great New levels can't wait to see what you come up with next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so much fun who ever thinks it ducks there are DUMB AND STUPID who ever thinks it cool is AWESOME AND COOL THEY ARE SO AWESOME AND COOL THAT I WANT TO MEET THEM IN REAL LIFE. and who thinks it not fun i want to throw up when I see them. that how much I hates people when they say how much minecraft sucks.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This reminds me of Mario kart so much fun but much more difficult.  Definitely worth the download.  Hope you have more fun racing games like this one.
B007EECSFA|3.0|A great ending, but took awhile to get there. I have read 3 other books by Kate Morton. They were better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of Nicholas Sparks better Books, really enjoyed this one a lot ! Hav !e to say I like most of his Books
0671646788|5.0|This book has helped me take charge of my negative thoughts that I have running through my head and turned them around into positive thinking and behavior. Reading this book you will see a common theme, you are what you think you are and you can do what you think you can do. It has helped me push through initiatives with leading my team at work as the leader of my team. My positive actions and leadership is bleeding off into my team, and I'm seeing a change already in the direction of better client satisfaction and more sales.I highly advise reading this book, reading this book gives you a feeling you can't do it. Read it and you will make the moves you should of, but didn't think you could...YOU CAN!!!  Remember, YOU are what you think.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love the endless struggle for Ethan and Lena to be together.<br />It was really a great sequel to the first book.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The movie arrived on time and as expected. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen and I got it for half price. I'm very pleased.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Have used this sharpener to sharpen both Kitchen and survival knives to great effect. It is nice to only use the ceramic side if the knife is already relatively sharp and just needs a quick honing. It is quick, easy and works well, in addition to being able to fit in your pocket.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|this is so simple to use!  I had a generic one and got frustrated with tyring to get it to work so I decided to purchase the actual Apple brand.  Plug it in and it works!!!
0738710261|5.0|I am not a big fan of these small decks, but this one seems to be an exception.  Great color, handling and the LWB is as good as any.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Amazing book, even though I watched the series before I read the books George R.R. Martin never stopped surprising me... I recommend this book to anyone who loves characters they can relate to.. or bitterly hate and a plot that will blow your mind
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We rented the movie because a buddy of mine said it was good.  It was much better then I ever thought it would be. We laughed through most of it and watched it 3 times in the 24 hours we had rented it for.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|With more and more electronics demanding higher current for charging, this 2 amp + 1 amp USB battery is great.<br /><br />I had a 7000mAh charger (2 x 1A ports) and it worked ok with older iPhone 4. When I upgraded to the Nokia Lumia 9200, I noticed that it took forever charging with it - 20% an hour. That was pretty unacceptable. I read somewhere that these new phones require higher current.. so I got one of these. It was very inexpensive so it was worth a try.<br /><br />Imaging my surprise when when, the first time I used it, this battery charges my phone from 30% to 100% in about an hour! I am not sure if this is normal or because it's brand new, but wow! I used the 2A port of course.<br /><br />Love it and highly recommend it!
B009T3AHDE|4.0|Totally weird.  But I knew this.  Robert Pattinson portrays an incredibly quirkly, complex character will skill and grace.  I would definetly recommend.  It is not a great story, it's a strange story but that is what makes it SO good.  He should have got way more US recognition for this.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|This version tries to be more of a &#34;thinking&#34; movie than the last one but it doesn't work. Not terrible but not great.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|You only watch this because you LOVE Robert Pattinson.  All the actresses do a great job.  You love his character and hate him at the same time.  The tape quality wasn't great.  I had to tweak my sound setting several times to hear the voices.  Still you have to see it if you love him!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The character of Whip is both heroic and flawed. This movie was intense but also a good study of a person.
B00275EGX8|5.0|My husband has always loved this movie.  I hadn't seen it until I got this one for him for Christmas.  I really enjoyed the movie once I was able to sit down and watch it.  Not for the faint of heart.  It really brings war out and show's just how bad it is and what our troops go though DAILY to keep us free.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Loved the series.  Used Series 1 & 2  at a Downton Abbey theme Tea Party.  Love the series. Got many of my friends hooked on the show.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Have not read a book that moved and interested me this much in awhile. I found the history fascinating. The characters were really well developed as was the plot.
B008JDAC7G|4.0|This game was alright. Decently replayabilityand very flashy colors and animations, Plenty of eye candy, but eventually as all games it has its shine wear off and its just another game.
B00881VLCE|3.0|works fine and is a good waste of time. I enjoy the game when I don't have anything to do.
B0042FZWC0|4.0|Great read. Highly motivational and brings up great questions we should all be asking ourselves. Inspired to lead an unconventional life.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|This book is very funny and light hearted.  You'd love all tha characters and the writing style of the author.  I did LOL alot.  Fantastic read!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I only have one complaint, I have to wait for the next book! :(  The author keeps you going with tons of plot twists that you never see coming, right up to the last paragraphs! Alas now I wait for the next one.......
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a great read.  Highly recommend it.  Sad to read that our own lawyers here in the States cause our SEALs higher fears than fighting the Taliban.  Looking forward to reading his follow up book.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this around Christmastime for a gift for my younger brother -- he LOVES it, as does the rest of the family!  The music is ridiculously catchy, and I think this was done a LOT better than the other Seuss cartoons like &#34;Horton Hears a Who&#34; etc.  Family friendly, funny, musical, and cute, with a message that is touching, but not TOO overwhelming.  Buy it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Learn a little about one of the greatest minds of our time. Gone much too soon. He is already missed.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Great movie!  I love that this film is uplifting, and a really great piece leading into everyone's favorite -- The Avengers!  It did have quite a few swear words, some scary images for the youngsters...but altogether a great family film.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|I bought the blu ray version and it is good quality but not as crisp as a movie produced for Blue Ray
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoyed the story, the concepts, as well as the cast do very well. This show has always been interesting, loads of fun to rewatch from the beginning.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|Like the layout but the L3 doesn't work. So there are of bunch of games I cant use the controller on. I want my money back
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was delightful to read. The end was suspenseful and makes you want more. Suzanne Collins again does a terrific job, paying close attention to detail and drawing you in. I couldn't put the book down.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|so speedy, great performance with games. very very recomended.<br />very quick deliver.<br />good price, good performance.<br />I recomend to buy this item, I'm going to buy another one soon
0802473156|2.0|Not in good shape the whole book was warped and looked like it had been wet. It came in sealed plastic, so it was not from the mail.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|very quick deliver.<br />good price, good look, works great.<br />I recomend to buy this item, I'm realy satisfied with this item
0307383415|4.0|It was a very interesting read, especially considering the historical context of Obama. However, I wish that he had focused a little more on his mother and more personal anecdotes prior to his going to college/ law school. Yet, the book does give insight into his psyche. The writing style was little &#34;too structured,&#34; not warm enough from my perspective to make the book feel more personal and up close.
0547884591|5.0|So much info is packed into this book.  Presented in a fun, irreverent manner, the book is about life skills - and then some.  A must read!
B000001BZT|5.0|Awesome CD by Steve Earle.  Love it.  First song is one of my all time favorites.  Will play it often
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty good graphics. pretty interactive too. my daughter loves it! overall a pretty fun game, I would recommend playing it!
B0009RCPY8|4.0|The guys from Saturday Night Live made a great comedy here. Lots of fun and laughs in both Ghostbusters 1 & 2.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie! Denzel at his best with a great supporting cast. The story is superb for a somewhat dark topic; dialogue, acting, soundtrack, top notch. Very realistic without being overly depressing.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Was so gorgeous and took me away from my little world to the BIG world that I never will see!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Not a bad game and nice to pass some time. I do fine it fairly easy. Most levels I get in the first try. Nice and colourful with cool sound effects.
1616550414|5.0|Unfortunately, I had to wait a few years to play the original Legend of Zelda. It was released when I was learning to walk. But since the late 1980s, I have played Zelda games constantly and become a happier person because of it. Just as people read great literature and watch epic films, I have immersed myself in these worlds and felt content and joyful - and yes, often sad - and in the end, more human. No book, of course, can do justice to this experience. But Hyrule Historia comes close. I regret that it does not contain even more material, just as I regret that the game must always end.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|This movie almost defies description, or at least my ability to describe. The Ninth Gate is easily one of my favorite movies. It probably is my favorite. this is the first time I have owned it on Blu ray, but the third time I have purchased it. Buy it, rent it, stream it, whatever, just watch it.
B00683JK9K|5.0|The pictures are beautiful. Straight forward/easy to use.  I like the &#34;edges first&#34; option like you would want with a puzzle in person.  I wish there were more pictures to do.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was on the second part of the game and when I turned it on it started at the beginning.  I don't want to do the whole game over again and I already paid for the second half.  How do I get back to where I was?
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its a card game.  Its easy to use.  It's solitare.  No frills, just card game.  Kinda weird the aces set up default on the left side instead of on top.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|good, it works for viewing fb and posting onto fb so I'm good with it, It is facebook and thats what I sought
B009EEFTMC|5.0|once I figured out that you can't drag the cubes, you tap them, i haven't put it down.  Fun game.  The &#34;advanced gamers&#34; in the house and the novices can both enjoy this one.  Excellent product.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Although her story is a very sad situation and she is pretty forthright about what she went through, I thought at times the story was dragged out for the benefit of filling a book.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|First of all it was really hyped up.  I've had scarier dreams.  Anyway, it is obsurd to believe that one incarcerated serial killer has soooo many followers and can pick up more along the way.  Not gonna happen. Perhaps he might get alot of fan mail in jail but not alot of people who want to kill other people to please him even if he does give them artistic license and don't have to copy him exactly.  Ahhhh....the arts!  Kevin Bacon is okay but thank goodness there are a plethora of other actors and actresses to take your attention away from him. I got bored after episode 2 and have now quit watching all together after episode 3.  Maybe the serial killer can kill the series or find a way to eiminate all his &#34;followers&#34;.
B001JEPVDM|3.0|I think this book gave me more insight on the Rwanda genocide but it was so detailed that at times it felt like I was reading his diary.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this a great game fore everyone to play.Young or old its fun and interaning a most have.My daughter loves it to even my grand kidzlove it
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Phenomenal movie, gorgeous on blu-ray. Definitely worth the price. however you probably knew that and if your on the fence for buying it, you also get a dvd copy
B0054JURZA|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Cher, even as far back as the Sonny and Cher days. She has such charisma, and her songs cut me to the quick. No joke, &#34;Believe&#34; makes me cry every time I hear it. As she asks the question &#34;Do you believe?&#34; I find my self in an almost euphoric state that leaves me speechless when I wake up cold and alone on the kitchen floor. Get this album. There is no way you'll regret it. :'-(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. It has me hooked from the beginning. And it's epic. Really great for a free game. So download it now. Nuff said.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Nickelback never ceases to amaze me with their soaring melodies and heartfelt lyrics. I wait with great anticipation for every crunchy chord, and every gristly vocal line. The best song on this album, in my humble opinion, is the track titled &#34;Rockstar.&#34; It really seems to capture the hard rocker's lifestyle that we all pine for as primate underlings. Five stars you Canadian rock gods!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I found this book a good read. It has a lot of violence and if you do not mind that you will probably like it also
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great hugging in high uhh though high uhh John uhh high g h h f f b g y y
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Compelling and well acted.  If you like history and period films, you will like Downton Abbey. Can't wait for season four.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good Grisham read that kept me up late turning the pages. Nice to see an unusual good guy deal with bad hand in a unique manner. Great storytelling!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|It holds you and is well written. You can almost vision yourself there. It is an excellent read for those who enjoy a few moments &#34;in another place&#34;.
0547884591|5.0|Great book, insightful into ways of learning, and a useful guide to mastering the art of food. The four hour chef.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!!!<br />This was a book that I just could not put down, definitely one of my favorite books ever!
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|If you like games that use the gyroscope (the device that detects orientation), then this is the game for you. The game allows you to select/modify your orientation in the options menu.<br /><br />The game is well made and has an interesting concept and can be challenging in later levels. The only issue I had was that, when played lying down, the orientation detection got a little iffy, at one point I would tilt it to the left and the fish would go up, so make sure you edit the orientation whenever your position changes.<br /><br />Played on HTC EVO 4G LTE
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun also the signs are cool and the neither reactor an quartz I like the pig men and u guys should  add fish and fishing rods and buckets to put lava/water in and add maps for the land and add things to use with red stone.<br />Please think about it mojong creators of minecraft please it's a good Idea on my be half. Thanks for  your time and always good job on your games .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this series down. Great characters and plot.  Surprised me at every turn. I read a lot and didn't figure this one out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so good, it continues the wonderful story of Anastasia and her dark prince Christian Grey. E.L. James has created another wonderful absorbing book. I love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think<br /><br /> this is the best book I have ever read<br />You should totally buy this book because it's awesome. Man
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I learned about this book from a friend who excitedly recommended it to me as a &#34;must read.&#34; RP1 is fast-paced, intelligent and a whole lot of fun. After a chapter or two, I was sucked into the storyline and loved every minute of it. Read and enjoy!
0007107927|5.0|Geat reading material, enjoying the contents and sharing with fellow employees.  Love the Author!  Learning from this book is excellent.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Denise
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|If you liked the original version in the theaters, you'll like this just a little bit better.  More jokes, mostly racist but equal opportunity- they pretty much bag on everyone.<br /><br />And Ted actually has a sweet story to it; it's more than just a stoner-teddy movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is always a fun game to play when you are bored on a rainy day. I can't stop playing it and I completely recommended this game to all ages.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I had heard all my life about this movie, but had never watched it.  Video was excellent, and I think this is a great movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!! anyone would love this game it is totally awesome and worth the $6.99 plus you can play anywhere you go. best game I have tried :-)
B0019NG73G|5.0|A special mention for the music of Gettysburg. It really adds a lot and is highly recommended on its own. The origin of this movie is interesting. Ted Turner is the single individual who pushed this through. He is a southerner (and does a cameo as a southern soldier), yet the book and the movie are \\"fair and balanced\\" regarding the opposing sides. One could argue that more time and understanding are afforded the confederate characters. Notwithstanding that the moral high ground is given to the north's Joshua Chamberlain, southern apologists are free to criticize him as sanctimonious. However, I question the application of fairness to this battle and war. One could pick any war in history and both sides will have bravery and intelligence and families and emotions. Yet one side may very well be fighting for something that is undeniably evil, in that time, and in the fullness of time.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book was okay in my opinion. Not bad, but not great. Even though the regression of the main character is central to the story, it made reading it somewhat boring as the language was a bit juvenile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I<br />Loved it! It kept my attention beginning to end! I can't wait to read the next book, catching fire!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly is relaxing, easy reading.  This is a take to the beach and read it all in one day type of book.
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN. MUCH BETTER ON M Y KINDLE FIRE HE THAN ON  MY IPOD. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH  TEMPLE RUN II, NOT QUITE AS GOOD, BUT STILL A LOT OF FUN T O PLAY.
0525953728|4.0|Book was on my book club's list, and was picked from a &#34;blind draw.&#34;  ALL club members are female, ranging in age from early  20's to mid 50's. We expressed the opinion that the book might be too &#34;guy stuff and technical&#34; for our tastes, and thought it might be more suitable for male readers but, ultimately decided to read it anyway. Turns out, it's a GREAT book. We thouroughly enjoyed it, and now the guys in our lives are reading the book too. They'd hear us discussing the book, and kept after us to hurry up and finish the book so they could read it too.  I would recommend this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY FUN, ADDICTING, AND YES IT IS FREE. DEFINITELY WORTH GETTING. IT'S HARD TO PUT IT DOWN.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|The MIB series are ALL great and entertaining.  We love good films that are not raunchy, but entertaining and exciting.  This film fits the bill and we enjoyed it.
B000VMBXNA|4.0|...or perhaps not!  This is a quick read and intelligent take on the inner life of a famous person and the object of duty.
B0079J28NC|5.0|Still great show after all these years.  I loved it then, and I still love it.  After all, &#34;All you need is love.&#34;
B009CPES4I|5.0|We have not got much to look forward to in our older age.  So fun to see people who are full of life get to do something fun in the later years.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|We just watched Argo last evening and were surprised as it was really very good.  We weren't sure if we would like it, not remembering too much about that situation, but much to our surprise as the movie progressed our interest did also.  Once in Iran and with all the orignal TV film clips here and there shown, it refreshed our memories of that time and how terrifying it must of been for all those hostages, but especially for the six that were hiding in the Canadian ambassador's house. The movie kept us on the edge of our seats once they headed for the airport in Iran. We think if you watch this movie you will agree it is very good and will make you proud of what the real people involved in this did way back then and just how they pulled it off.  Just amazing.....<br /><br />It was a classified mission and it is amazing that events like this do take place to save Americans, only until they are declassified do we know any of the details as we do in Argo. The ending is touching as it tells the updated story of the real six Americans along with the real Tony Mendez. The cooperation between the USA and Canada was not at all a surprise since our two countries live side by side in peace, two of the few that do in this world.<br /><br />Job well done by everyone involved with the making of this movie, which is why I gave it five stars......
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Well portrayed.  Loved the scenary, and the nastagia of the movie. Actors did a great job truly portrayed the era.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this app.  Its like taking carenof a real horse.  It also teaches kids responsibility of what its like to have a real pet.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Missed Matt Damon.  The Bourne Supremacy can not be out done.  With that said it was still a good movie.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I ordered this for a friend for her birthday and it came right in time.  Fast shipping, great packaging, pretty good price, and that's really about it.  I'm not a fan of the movie, but it's one of her all time favorites so, she was really happy to have this in BluRay.  Thank you!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I think this has to be one of Clint Eastwoods best movies.  But I have always been anxious to watch any that he had been in as they have come out.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I loved the graphic novel and to see it in movie form was great, love the animated Batman movies. All of them...
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I like Meryle Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  There was no disappointment for me here.  Very funny and close to home.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Was shown to me by a friend and had to have it. Play it several times a day is very adictive
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|We have watched each of these movies as they have come out. Just an addition to the continuing story line.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|I enjoyed it very much.  I saw the movie long time ago, I had forgotten many details.  The actors are very good. I suggest that you all watch it again and compare with the new one.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved this movie, they have always been good and make you wait for the next one.  This one was as good or better that the previous.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|One of my favorite class reads. This love story is so untold and unheard of. I just had to read it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very functional and useful... it seems as though there are some privacy concerns, though. That's unfortunate, since I've used this on my tablet, phone, desktop, laptop, and kindle.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is a fun gamer. You have to look for stuff in different rooms.When you get done with room some times you unlock new ones.
B000683VI4|3.0|My case was broken and it did not tell me that before I bought it, Everything else was fine though,
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I actually thought this was going to be the latest version of the swivel sweeper, but it seems to be identical to the one I already have. Even so, it's a pretty good deal for the cost...I REALLY wanted an updated version though!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I received my order on time, as it was promised and in great condition. I love this series and can't wait to watch the second season.  I just finished sean one.
B0001US62I|5.0|Scary good and a great story - Loved it -though disturbing. Great acting - and before Mickey messed up his face - and a true departure role for DeNiro - even more so than Cape Fear.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|A few filler tracks took away from the overall strength of the album but a very solid come back effort.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I love Denzel and thought that the trailer looked like a good balance of action and story.  I kept getting excited about the events as they were revealed, but ended up feeling like without any backstory about the pilot and how he got where he was, the ending felt predictable and empty.  I didn't mind the predictability but it just seemed to never go beneath the surface.<br /><br />Maybe enough for others.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I use this processor on my media box in my living room every day. I upgraded from a dual core 65w AMD processor that worked great, but paled in comparison to the performance this processor gave me. I would recommend this to anyone who looks to use this for light gaming AND or for a 1080p capable HTPC. Its low power and puts out great performance for your buck.
0307455874|4.0|Really its the Audacity of the Liberal.. You think Warren Buffet is for taxing the rich ....a good guy right?  On the subject of inheritance tax, Buffet says &#34;And they actually think they deserve to keep that money&#34; (you know, the money your parents worked all their lives, and sacrificed for).<br /><br />It is amazing how people with money talk freely about taking mine, while they are convinced their money is protected - in a foundation, swiss account, etc.<br /><br />The book is a real eye opener.  He might have written this one.  It has the same periods of rambling as the &#34;Dreams of the Father&#34; book.<br /><br />The provider shipped on time, and the condition was &#34;like new&#34;.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story makes us all think about our past naive thought of how life should proceed. It makes me rethink my actions in my own 2nd marriage. I will try harder, like Pat, to be Nice Not Right!!!  I can't wait to see the movie !!
0786182466|5.0|This is one of the funniest, saddest, most thoughtful books I have ever read (actually heard). I have listened to it three times to catch the nuances, and to hear the narrator read certain sections, especially the &#34;whoo-ee!&#34; It does take some patience at first, but is well worth it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun game that you will want to play again and again.<br />Would definitely recommend this one to buy
B009CPEOC4|4.0|this movie was surprisingly entertaining and lacked the more inappropriate edge I feared it would have.  There are a few words here and there, but nothing extreme.  Appropriate for tweens/teens.
B0000013GS|5.0|Title says it all. The album itself is an absolute classic and must have for all hip-hop fans and the vinyl quality is great as well.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I must admit that I had some reservation when I ordered this new Met production of the ring.  I was concerned that the lack of &#34;traditional&#34; sets would be too much of a distraction.  But to my surprise I find that I like the new sets, if you can truly call them sets - and the artists and orchestra are up to the Met's normal high standards.  I can recommend this set unless you are ultra conservation in your choice of settings for the Ring.
B0001AP13A|1.0|Like many other people both of my discs must have been pressed poorly as every song skipped around. Great album but avoid this vinyl version.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|Wow! I like is't item!!!  I won't write much about this model. But it is the best active figure which I have now. I pulled out model from a box, looked and - returned back :) Very beautiful and pleasant model. 100% perfect replica from other Metroude, really good articulation, and just overall great product presentation and quality. I recommend. I bought on November 7, 2012, for 104 US dollars.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|Great album! Absolutely love it, the remakes are great too! He has a great voice and would love to see more albums in the future.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book very honest and enlightening. As a Christian, there was nothing I found offensive or inconsistent with my faith. God reveals Himself in any way He chooses. Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for sharing your journey.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|An excellent piece of free software that is easy to use and complete moderately complex math problems.  Simple to use.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Best pony game ever! So much fun despite having to pay for a few things. I can't seem to out it down for long.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Kristen Stewart is not the best candidate for Snow White. As a fan of Nina Dobrev, I seriously believe she is a better actress and more likely to incur the wrath of the beautiful queen as being more beautiful. Loved Hemsworth and Heigel.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I love Denzel Washington.  This movie bites the big one though.  It starts out great and I was on the edge of my seat for the beginning of the movie.  After the plane crash the movie is basically about addictions and lies.  If I wanted to watch a dark, depressing movie about people overcoming lies and addictions I would have rented that.  Funny how they don't show any footage of 90% of this movie in the initial clips.  If they did, most people wouldn't have rented this or bought it.  However, you decide for yourself.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I wasn't too sure how I was gonna feel about this movie especially because I grew up watching the animated Disney version, but I have to say I really liked it. Yes, some parts were a little cheesy for an adult to watch but it almost made it cuter. 5 stars nonetheless.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|good story and covers a lot of good topics.  not sure that it was extremely relavent to my business.  but i did recommend it to the teacher of business at our local school as a good resource.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Do yourself a favor. Buy this movie immediately. No like right now. Press 'send to cart'. And yet, right now.
0743487486|5.0|How often have you heard parents justify their parental dictates on the basis of “because this family is not a democracy”? On the surface, that probably sounds rather common sensical. Who would think that little people who have never had to punch a time clock or make a mortgage payment would know anything about running a family? Instead, conventional wisdom (along with most “experts”) tell us that children need a firm, strong hand, clear boundaries and limits and predictable consequences for violating said limits.<br /><br />Finally, at long last comes Alfie Kohn to turn such conventional assumptions on their head. Why, Kohn asks, should children be expected to be unquestioningly obedient to adults? Why should adult needs and desires necessarily trump those of children? In fact, if you ask most parents what they want for their children in the long run, you will probably hear words like “independent”, “self-assertive”, “creative” and “confident”. Why then do we so often fall back on day-to-day parenting strategies that insist on obedience and parental control?<br /><br />Kohn is no Pollyanna. He recognizes that parenting is hard work and that there are real life demands that must be met. He is not naïve enough to think that children are always sweet and wonderful or that there’s a magic pill that will make children automatically helpful and cooperative. But he does argue that the stresses of parenting and family life, along with outside pressure, lead us to use control-based disciplinary techniques which seem like “common sense” and which may even be guaranteed to “work” by parenting “guidebooks” written by “experts”. Such tactics, however, according to Kohn, are not only counterproductive in the long run for actually increasing children’s responsiveness, but are actually harmful to children because of how they make (or at least seem to the child to make) parental love conditional on behavior, when what children really need is unconditional love.<br /><br />Kohn deconstructs what punishment really means: making someone suffer – inflicting physical or emotional pain – for something “bad” they have done. He argues that it is hard to reconcile unconditional love with being willing to make a loved one suffer pain. Furthermore, Kohn does not limit punishment to things like spanking, yelling or taking away possessions. Kohn argues that “time-outs” – typically thought to be a gentler response to misbehavior – count as punishment too because of the use of “love withdrawal”. In fact, time-outs may be one of the worst forms of punishment because they explicitly tie parental love and attention to behavior, which sends the message to the child that s/he is only lovable when s/he is being “good”. Given how dependent children are on their parents, this is almost tantamount to the threat of abandoning the child if s/he doesn’t behave.<br /><br />Moreover, Kohn goes further to show that focusing on rewarding children for positive behavior is little if any better than punishing bad behavior. Rewards and punishments, in fact, are simply flip sides of the same coin. Both focus on overt behavior rather than underlying causes of behavior. Both make parental love and approval conditional upon “good” behavior. And both are a form of control – methods of “doing to” children to coerce obedience.<br /><br />Kohn argues instead that we should strive for “working with” methods of interaction which give kids a voice and sense of control over their own lives. Kohn argues that humans, including children, have a fundamental need to have a sense of control. Feeling overcontrolled can make kids either rebel and counteract the intention and efficacy of the controlling tactics, or else they will basically wilt and give in, thereby losing sense of their own autonomy and initiative. In either case, children experiencing too much control are likely to have less self-esteem (or, at least, self-esteem that is more conditional upon others’ approval), be less willing to take risks and explore, and be more susceptible to outside influences and pressure.<br /><br />Contrary to popular misconceptions, however, Kohn is not arguing for a free-for-all. Giving up control does not mean a hands-off approach or letting children do and get away with whatever they want. In fact, unconditional parenting involves more parental engagement, not less. Parents need to be consistently working with their children; teaching, explaining and modeling appropriate behavior; explaining and helping children to understand the effects of their behavior on other people; working (and struggling) with – not against – their children to solve problems and conflicts and come up with mutually workable solutions; and struggling with their own vulnerabilities in order to allow for a more genuine presentation and authentic, trust-based relationships with children.<br /><br />Making this extra effort pays off first of all in terms of greater responsiveness from children. In a seeming paradox, children who are less controlled respond better to parental directives when they are given and are more willing to cooperate with their parents. But more importantly, such efforts pay off in terms of raising happy, healthy, secure and confident young people who are better able to manage life in the “real world” than children whose parents have used controlling methods to get them “ready for” the real world. Moreover, secure and confident children are more likely to grow up to be the kinds of people who see the faults with the “real world” and who are willing to work to make them better rather than just accepting that that’s the way things are.<br /><br />I have always had a sense of how I wanted to raise my daughters (currently ages 4 and 6), and neither punishments nor rewards have ever felt right to me (although I will confess to having used both at times, to my lasting regret). This book has helped me crystallize and articulate my misgivings as well as point me to a better path which I always sensed was there and which I’ve foundered around trying to find on my own. I am fortunate to have relatively “good” and “easy” children, but I’ve found that I can make things even easier (or at least less conflictual) by letting go and learning to trust my daughters’ good impulses and the loving upbringing I’ve given them so far. When it comes to picking battles, the only one I think is worth fighting is the battle to maintain a healthy, open relationship with them, and the less I punish or reward and the more I just listen and support, the less of a battle it is.take risks and explore, and be more susceptible to outside influences and pressure.<br /><br />Contrary to popular misconceptions, however, Kohn is not arguing for a free-for-all.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this as a replacenent to a similar  game that had stopped working. I like this one so much more. I can easily play one set after another and not become board. I didn't understand at first that the entire grid needed to be filled, that was different from the other game, but it was easy to figure out. And I have not had any technical problems with this one. Lots of fun.
B000B5Y00U|5.0|This recording had been with me for many years.<br />La Traviata is not my favourite Verdi piece, I must admit. But it is a musically beautiful piece, with so many distinguished recordings and videos, with so many avante garde treatments available.<br />This performance can be considered an 'old fashioned' type of performance - the Sempre Libera does not end with an E flat, as it was not in the score in the first place. Quite incidentally, nearly ALL the vocally great Violettas do not go for this E flat. Sutherland is of course great, but others far less so. I would not name them here.<br />Caballe's Violetta is simply the most vocally beautiful rendition ever, and likely to remain so for a very long forseeable future! To say that she is too mature sounding for Violetta. But then, is Violetta a green girl? Such 'maturity' is really spot on for the role.<br />Then Carlo Bergonzi, the most neglected Italian tenor of the 20th century, yet most likely to be the greatest.<br />Alfredo is not such a heroic role as Manrico, Radames, Ernani,...Bergonzi's burnished yet fully lyrical tenor is really the most perfect vehicle for this role. He sounds so young, so impetuous, so alert in this recording! Perfectly on par with Caballe's Violetta in every turn in terms of vocal finesse and vocal drama.<br />As Germont elder, the then young Sherill Milnes demonstrates why he became in due course the top baritone at MET for more than 2.5 decades. The voice is so bouyant, with such warmth and beauty!<br />As others have noted, the conductor wasn't the best among the entire cast, but luckily he had with him such a terrific vocal cast.<br />Can this set be issued in better sound?<br />As it is, it seems that this eminent recording is at present being taken for granted, and much more mediocre ones have all the limelight.<br />Too sad.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|The [[ASIN:B008MF3OEY Verso Prologue Marbled Blue for Kindle Fire (Blue) (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)]] is a very attractive case that provides good protection for your Kindle Fire.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Rare is the movie whose outcome you already know that concurrently keeps you in suspense throughout. This is one of them. Amazing.
B004KRQFI0|3.0|this album is okay.  was sorely disappointed after see that some of my favorite songs from Skrillex weren't on here: 'Levels', 'First of the Year'.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This book had intriguing and provoking thoughts but I found myself a bit bored with at times. Perhaps the characters were not as intriguing as the questions it asks. It was a good read but nothing I would rant and rave about.
B0000046X0|5.0|Not my kind of music but my husband requested it and he loves it.  Satisfied with this gift item -- no complaints.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|The CD is great! the packaging was cheap. The sounds was great, a little different than her her CD. but good. The container was cheap.

B0085YNML2|5.0|Cut, Fun, Challenging. What else could you ask for. Play it almost every day during my lunch. I would recommend.
1430300612|5.0|I know my title for this review is over the top, but this book resonated with my experiences in meditation and science which, together, have led me to see that life is not about \\"me\\". (And, in case you're wondering, I think it's also not about \\"you\\".) Ms. Taylor had a chance to get off the rat race treadmill through an accident of brain damage and just be, with no ego. I found that inspiring.<br /><br />I was ecstatic to read the story, and hope everyone finds some insight for themselves from Taylor's sharing of the story in such a reasoned and clear way.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive. Play... Wait for more coins... Play some more... Repeat... Cant stop... Please Help MEEEEE!! Lol, Good game. I Spend much time just dropping coins.

B00AECGQF2|4.0|Well, this app is very fun with addicting features such as the hair curlers, the iron, the spray paints, and much much more! I just think that the price I a little ridiculous, I mean three dollars? Really? I think they should bring down the price to ninety nine cents. Otherwise, a great app!
B000I9W08I|5.0|Great movie and movie quality on instant video! Give us more musicals like this on Amazon Instant Video! Thank you
B000UVLK1M|4.0|Not a bad CD if you like improv. I enjoyed the soft style of the songs, great for easy listening, but I'm a little more of a fusion and Jazz Rock person, reason for four stars.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Definitely a horror fanatic favourite. Great story line, and loads of gore. Would definitely recommend to other horror fans out there.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|Pat Metheny, what more can you say. The man rocks. This one of his all-time greats. My wife had this on cassett and it stopped playing correctly. She was a little hurt about that, so when I say it on CD, I ordered it for her. We love this CD. Like I said. Pat rocks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|awesome, different, not at all expected. a step beyond fiction, but not science fiction.  the author has quite an imagination.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fun family game that all age levels can play.  Great for game nights with groups of friends.  Not a big learning curve.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is addicting, awesome,full of action, and lots of other great words.I would definitely give the makers an a plus. GOOD JOB!!!!!!!
B009X01C64|4.0|I like this cover for my Kindle. The only change I would make would be to change the elastic strap that holds it closed for a round elastic like the one on my small Kindle's cover.
B008Y73940|5.0|Excellent.  The storyline s very believable. It keeps you interested and wanting more.  The action is fast-paced and the little twists and turns make you want more.  This gave you everything -- action, murder, legal drama.  I would recommend this to friends and family.  I loved the use of his car s his office.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I always loved this movie as a kid, and when I seen it for sale I had to buy it. It is a great price for a classic movie. Now my kids will be able to enjoy the same movies I was able to when I was younger.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You will not be able to put it down. Read it even if you have seen the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I always loved this movie as a kid, and when I seen it for sale I had to buy it. It is a great price for a classic movie. A mix where real life meets cartoons. Couldn't get much better than that!

B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is just an all around great movie. Am so glad that i had the chance to buy it and own it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is very fun to me and many others. It is very similar to the game Subway Surfer,only with a twist. You are being chased by a monster and the obstacles are very hard to face. So in result,I give this game 4 stars. So see you later in my next review for Jetpack Joyride<br /><br />That's all folks!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an incredible program - writing and performances are superior to anything else on TV!  It is well worth your time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is very fun and I hope you see my high score as my name is ADog 2470. It's very good at keeping you happy(unless you only get 5miles). My favorite Jet pack is the simple Machine Gun jetpack. I have to congratulate Halfbrick&trade;on this game and Fruit Ninja. That's why I gave this game 5stars. So I'll see you next in my review on Logo Quiz.<br /><br />That's all folks!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|cant really say enough about this cpu, ive owned quite a few other intel processors before and havent had a problem with one of them. love this cpu it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was definitely not what I expected...from all the hype, I was certain that I was going to be aghast at some of the contents in the story, but I think that it was all introduced into the story appropriately and it was necessary to the plot. Whereas many 'novels' with explicit sex scenes are random with no plot...so basically just porn, that was not the case with the 50 Shades Trilogy.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|This was a very good book. I would highly recommend it to any science fiction or military fiction reader. There were some very interesting and unique features in the story. I will definitely consider reading more from this author.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved book one & two.  even though this book was not as good as the first two as it went off a little with a side story, it was still good and presented a good closure to the story.<br /><br />*FYI* I read this book in May 2012, but have just recently decided to start writing reviews as I have become dependent on other readers' opinions to determine what book I will read next.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I would highly recommend this app, it works very well, appearing as you turn on your device and showing the charge in your battery, also the length of charge available for each function. Great. It is kind on the eye, and as a free download, fantastic value, I would have happily paid for this...
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down.  And thank goodness I had a Kindle so that I was able to immediately download the sequel or I would have freaked out at 2am!<br /><br />This was a new plot...unlike so many other story lines that basically just rename the characters and choose a different setting. The writing is superb and draws you in from the get go.<br /><br />**although this review's post date in 2/2013, I read this book and its sequel in June 2012**
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most best app in app history! It really should win against Angry Birds in the Kids Choice Awards 2013! I recommend Creative when you first play so you'll get to know the game. Then you play Survival, where you have to build a shelter and survive from the monsters like creepers and zombies. Stay away from Creepers!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy was definitely not what I expected...from all the hype, I was certain that I was going to be aghast at some of the contents in the story, but I think that it was all introduced into the story appropriately and it was necessary to the plot. Whereas many 'novels' with explicit sex scenes are random with no plot...so basically just porn, that was not the case with the 50 Shades Trilogy. I found the writing very engaging and must say it was a learning experience as I had to Google some things to understand exactly what was being mentioned/described.<br /><br />There are quite a few 'copycats' out there like, Bared to You and This Man, which are being compared to 50 Shades...there is absolutely no comparison as 50 Shades is much, much, better and has a believable plot to go along with the sexually explicit scenes.<br /><br />*FYI* I read this book in May 2012, but have just recently decided to start writing reviews as I have become dependent on other readers' opinions to determine what book I will read next.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very nice app, great for on the go lifestyle.Fits nicely on KINDLE FIRE,I can imagine that it would be very nice for phones, and the new device's that are coming out.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|Great Movie Thanks! Love these types of movies! They are so funny. Will Smith is great!  So entertaining ! I definitely recommend watching this one !
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Sorry readers- my review for this was accidentally attached to the 2nd book in the trilogy.<br />Please see my review under Shadow of Night - which I plan to read next!
B004SIP9MY|5.0|Now I have all 4 movies! I love scary movies. Especially the scream series! I grew up when they came out.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Love his style of prose because it's easy to follow and lots of characters and scenarios repeat themselves. recommend reading all three in the trilogy.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Twists and turns. Surprises around every corner. I can hardly wait to see where this story goes next. This all started for me with the show and I had to have more.
1589949811|5.0|I love card games, but tended to shy away from things like Magic back in the day. It was too expensive to keep up, and it was hard to find people that I enjoyed playing against. This sort of fills that niche. You can play the game solo, and because its the LCG(Living Card Game) format, you really don't have to worry about &#34;keeping up&#34; you just kinda move at your own pace. The artwork is some of the best that I have ever seen in a card game. The stock is above average (not exactly the best, but definitely above average).<br /><br />The game is pretty hard, just as a disclosure. I find I get the most out of it approaching each level like its own puzzle. You also have to be open to tearing your decks apart and rebuilding often. It is a deck building game after all. Go in with the right expectations, and you'll be highly rewarded.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Actually, I was pretty impressed with how well things display on this and how little it affects the GoPro's overall battery life. The button on the side is a little hard to press, but I consider that a good thing because my biggest gripe with the main GoPro product is &#34;accidental&#34; button presses.<br /><br />Get it, use it where you need to frame your shots. Works well.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|I love board games. I also tend to be relatively critical of them.<br /><br />I got this game to play with my girlfriend who is not a hardcore gamer (read-doesn't like deep RPG titles, or things that are complex for the sake of being complex) and this really hit the nail on the head. You'll find a dash of strategy, but nothing too deep. You will find choice in how you handle your turns, a dynamic board that plays a bit differently every time, and something that's just fun.<br /><br />The pieces are also beautiful, and very high-quality. The bamboo and die are made of wood. The miniatures for the panda and farmer are pleasant, and the tiles/card stock is durable and well painted. The box also has a great organizer. Everything has a place in it, your setup and breakdown time will be next to nothing.<br /><br />There has been a revision or two in wording in the rules... if you do a quick google search you can find this. It clears up a thing or two.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|My favorite movie - please note that this movie is written by Carl Sagan and appears to be about aliens and outer space. Nope. Get that concept out of your brain. The movie is about HUMANS, and how our society will react to news of aliens or other civilizations.<br /><br />How does humanity deal with all the potential issues this causes with religion and other beliefs? Watch the film to find out! It's great!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun to play just a bit glitchy but not so bad that you don't want to keep playing! bring on the next one

B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor has been singing hits ever since I was in grade school and he still makes me cry when I hear some of his songs. &#34;I always thought I would see you again&#34; was played for a friend's funeral and there wasn't a dry eye in the crowd. Then we played &#34;Just Call Out My Name&#34; and I knew the man's soul was in Heaven and I was still here calling out his name. I love this album and gave a copy to the gentleman's mother when she heard &#34;Sweet Baby James&#34; she smiled and told me to always remember the good times we had with him. One of my favorite things I have ever bought here on Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|very addictive!!  I'm not a fan of the zombie thing but am VERY interested in what's going to happen to the humans!!!!!
B001JQHQWE|5.0|I bought this album for my new little tablet to listen to while working and I am sure glad I did, it is wonderful. Almost every song brings in floods of memories from my past, mostly happy times. I remember my friend's mother playing Cat Stevens every day at her house and at 10 years old we were all singing his songs by heart. Now, I can sing with my neices and nephews in the car because they love his songs now too. And the beat goes on....
B000N6TYLW|1.0|I bought this for my girlfriend now my ex-girlfriend. She sat me down and made me watch episode after episode until I just simply wanted to burn my eyes out of my head. If I had known how terribly bad this program was I would have broke up with my girlfriend before hand or simple jumped off a bridge to spare myself another second of this filth. Anyone that legitimate likes this show should make an appointment to see a doctor because you probably have cancer and are on the verge of death.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|I bought this book and the enhanced audio verision as soon as Chris Kyle was murdered by a fellow Navy Vet. I haven't had time to even start the book, but I hope most of the proceeds will go to his family. Our American Navy Seal Hero was just that a HERO, he protected this country with his life overseas and here in the states. I will be praying for his family and the rest of the many veterans who will be coming home soon.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Emily over at BluntReview (dot) com says: House of Cards is one of the scariest dramas this viewer has ever seen - and that includes both seasons of American Horror Story. The reason HoC's is so intense? Simple: it plays so terribly true.<br /><br />Politics are known to be a tad nasty. But, you aint seen nothun' yet.<br /><br />Story goes...Your about to get a peek behind that curtain. But know now this is an adult geared drama fine tuned into a heady work of fiction so real, you want to see the consulting credits.<br /><br />Through one particularly creepy Senator, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), we watch as people we voted in to office finagle Bills, puppet people like modern day Geppettos, and ambitious career climbers' find themselves sunk deeply into the left pocket of some game they're playing; for no other reason than a favor is needed by an opposing member...or for an agenda planned well down-the-road.<br /><br />In the role of loving wife you are served one Claire Underwood (Robin Wright). She is a smart, conniving, shapely barracuda disguised in the season's finest frocks. Slithering beside Claire, as Underwood's personal lap dog we meet Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Yeah, if that lap dog was a rabid Maltese with its eye on a prime rib...in or out of the source's anatomy.<br /><br />And ladies and gentlemen, may we introduce rising journalist Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara). Here's a chickbabe that doesn't mind using - and being used. Where is she getting those scoops?<br /><br />Finally, but certainly not to be out done in anything-for-the-career is a young go-get-'er other-side-of-the-shipyard politician in the hairs of Underwood's plans, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). This guy will make your jaw drop a few times at the shear depths he's willing to peruse in the name of personal success.<br /><br />Everyone in and around the plots and subplots of House of Cards is riveting. The lengths the characters go to for...well what ever it is they want - and here read WANT! - complete with a foot-stamping tantrum in mind. Each episode intertwines a personal life soap operetta with the everyday cogs-in-motion of a few people in various stages of political power. You watch in horror as \\"We the People,\\" vote in these masked pontificators, who with our unknowing nods of approval, cut 12000 jobs to garner a mere 3000 for no other reason than it suits their personal agendas or that of the corporation that supports their campaign.<br /><br />As all the remarkable drama unravels you may start to feel a bit heavy-hearted, as the realization that this \\"show\\" is part of what happens in our government branches happens every single day...It is politics as usual in deed.<br /><br />That being typed, there's nothing as usual from this cast. The acting is precise; look at the cast. Kevin Spacey as Underwood is gonna give you acid reflux. You know this person under another name, is up at \\"The Hill\\" weaving Bills and laws without an iota of care for where his constituents chips may fall. And Mr. Spacey does bad so good.<br /><br />Stoll as Russo makes your skin crawl. He's just an ass. But his pliability by those larger up on the political food chain knows at your comfort level. You may need a jar of caramel sauce handy for quick infusions of happy endorphins; the chemicals and high fructose corn-syrup subsidy in today's decadent faux creation seems entirely appropriate.<br /><br />But even as the men are swimming amongst the sharks, it is truly the gals that tend to steal the show. The womens' roles are smartly written and there are no wilting flowers in this bunch of grab-you-by-the-throat ladies. Zoe is chilling. Claire is a delight to watch weave her web of decided devotion vs. self-agenda.<br /><br />Uber-talent, Robin Wright, plays Claire on a razor's edge. Just when you think she's got a pulse, she'll go and, well, do something, momentarily reminding you just how sociopathic she has become. Ambition is the undercurrent for both she and Zoe.<br /><br />And Kate Mara takes her version of Zoe from a persona-to-the-world of a doe-eyed newbie, to the werewolf headline seeker she is in 0-to-80. Zoe's goal is to be someone - and to hell with anyone in her way. Brava Ms. Mara. A gal role with titanium balls.><br />And Kate Mara takes her version of Zoe from a persona-to-the-world of a doe-eyed newbie, to the werewolf headline seeker she is in 0-to-80.

B00ANW33CM|4.0|I love Mahjong playing with the tiles and the 'real' walls of Chinese playing cards and having this deluxe verison is great because my trial membership has been over for about six months. Now, I can challenge myself to even more layouts and stop and come back to the same game if I am busy. Thanks.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I selected this book while searching for new authors, unread before.  Well written, with a storyline so well threat that it was difficult to put the book down.  Convincingly placed in time and space, the characters are well rounded and endearing.  Definitely an author to look out for!
B001KWR3PM|5.0|Eric Clapton or Slow Hand Clapton really shows off his talents in this great album of some of his greatest hits ever. I still cry when he sings &#34;Tears in Heaven&#34;. the recording is perfect and I love to sing along with most of songs. Great price for great classics.
1616550414|5.0|I have always like the legend of zelda and now i have this awesome book to help me like it even more!

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Good story and insightful to what life is like with and without faith and hope.  In the words of Harold, &#34;life without love has no....  something with a v&#34;.  I think he was thinking value. I feeling thankful for my loved ones.
B004GYY714|2.0|IT a great app but wasnt right for me give it a try and decide for yourself. i like it.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book is a great educational & motivational tool.  It provides you insight as to how we often have preconceived notions of conversations because of our inability to listen properly and seek a better understanding.  The title was what attracted me to the book and it does everything to explain how we often see things.  If it is not all about me, then it must be about someone else.  We often put ourselves first, this book helps to put things into a new perspectives.
0887431461|2.0|Was written in on almost every page. Pages were torn. Definitely a waste of money. A couple of pages would have been understandable. Not most of the book.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|CRJ has made one of the most catchy tunes in decades.  It brings back has a nostalga that brings back a time when songs made you feel good.  Sometimes that is truly overlooked in today's music scene.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, think, and inspired me more than anything I've ever read. I think everybody who's able should read this book.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Ever since I've started working in a corporate environment, I've come to identify with this movie more and more.  One of my favorites.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Love the c.d. Kendrick Lamar is so deep! I can see him being around for a while. He is definitely not your average rapper. Shipping was great had a small hole in the brand new case, maybe hanging up in a record store. Cd and insert were not damaged.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I love cheesy action packed sci-fi movies like this.  Its pretty much everything you'd want from a movie that combines aliens, space marines, and vikings.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this  game and I have played it for years! The graphics are wonderful and the horse is almost realistic!
B0081336FO|4.0|If you are browsing to find something to good to watch, you have found it. This is a very well written, produced and acted story that has been modernized perfectly. I watch little &#34;tv&#34; because I despise the laziness of reality shows. Each of the Sherlock episodes are better than most of the blockbuster crap Hollywood has been churning out.  The series (seasons 1 and 2) is phenomenal. I don't give it 5 stars because I am trying  to not cheapen the rating system. This show was faultless, in my opinion and deserves your attention. I also hate reviews that tell you the entire story. If you are looking for quality watch this.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A good study in human character. I read this book to my children as a bedtime story over a couple months.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book seemed slightly less pornographic than the other two books.  There was no reason this had to be a trilogy.  The story could have been completed in one book and really seemed like a romance novel instead of seeming like pure porn.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book better than the 1st! I could not put it down. Very revealing and love how indepth characters and story line is.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book was slightly less pornographic but still pornographic to my way of thinking.  I read it thinking it might get a little better and it did but very little.  Again the language and settings the people were in seemed pornographic to me.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The game was a blast to play! Good details. Not to hard or easy.<br />Lots of hidden object scenes if thats your thing.<br />Im off to find another G5 game!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I thought it was pure porn for the language and the situations the two people were put in.  It definitely was not romantic in any sense of the word.
0765334798|3.0|Andrew Dahl is a newly-assigned crewman on the Intrepid, the flagship of the Universal Union. Initially what appears to be a plum assignment turns into a nightmare. Almost every away mission turns into a lethal showdown with hostile aliens and crewmen are frequently killed, although oddly the bridge crew seem to survive every one of these encounters. As the situation becomes more bizarre and crew are slain by robots, alien worms and - somewhat unexpectedly - ice sharks, Dahl becomes determined to find out what the hell is really going on.<br /><br />Redshirts is John Scalzi's tribute to all of those unfortunate extras and minor characters whose sole purpose in life is to show up for ten minutes and then die in a feeble attempt to make the audience believe the main characters might be in danger. It's a huge, nerdy in-joke that anyone who's ever sat through an episode of Star Trek should appreciate. Anyone who hasn't (and Star Trek and its cheesier tropes - distressingly - are getting a bit long in the tooth these days) might find the book pretty pointless.<br /><br />The book starts off as a look at the workings of such a ship from the POV of the regular crewmen rather than the command crew (and yes, The Next Generation did a whole episode about that) but rapidly escalates into being a funny commentary on the aforementioned TV tropes before moving into a metafictional storyline about fictional characters coming to life before skewing sideways into a very ill-advised attempt at pathos (which falls completely flat due to a lack of decent characterisation, meaning we don't care). Scalzi seems to be aping funny SF authors like Harry Harrison, Terry Pratchett (whose Guards! Guards! pursues a vaguely similar premise, but altogether more successfully) and Douglas Adams. However, the premise of the novel is one that Douglas Adams threw into a TV documentary about his own life, explored and moved on from in about five minutes. Stretched over 300 pages, the premise becomes rather thin. Scalzi is a funny writer (though not in the same league as the aforementioned writers) and the laughs keep things ticking over, but despite a couple of attempts to make serious points (most notably in the codas, where the laughs dry up but the prose style improves markedly) the novel is pretty lightweight and disposable.<br /><br />Redshirts (***) is an entertaining, easy read which will make you laugh for a bit but you will also completely forget about within a week.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved this book probably the most of all of them. Fabulously written! I was so hooked I couldn't put it down.... Will definitely be reading the whole saga again and again!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love using this calculator on my Kindle Fire.  It is really neat.  It is worth trying, don't have to keep on my Kindle, I put it in the cloud, when I need it, I download it.
1457514508|4.0|Yes, Savannah; the city that was burned, the city that is Gone With The Wind, the city with the tales in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil has now once again, delighted me with the characters and stories of Duncan Whitehead's The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club. This amusing and delightful book takes you from Buenos Aires, Paris, Austria and unpacks your excitement, amusement and intrigue in the Savannah neighborhood on Gordonston and it's park.  Even the dogs of the neighborhood -- and their camaraderie -- unite the neighbors, their lives, and their relationships.  Woof!! Woof!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I loved the game at first but once I hit level thirty I lost the ability to give treasure chest or gifts to my friends. I was told that my friends have a different version of game. That is incorrect. I was able to perform. this option until this stage of the game. Now it is frustrating and no longer a game I can share with friends. I now have to play alone as there doesn't seem to be a remedy. Very sad. I will not recommend as it doesn't work as described.
B005LAII80|5.0|TO THE HUBBY AND THE TEENAGER OF THE HOUSE, THEY BOTH REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. BUT MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS MOVIE BETTER IN 3D.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The plane as a metaphor of a man who managed to survive, along with a majority of his passengers, a brutal crash landing, was powerful. From the moment it crashed, this movie really took off in the telling of the horrors and atrocities of those who struggle with serious addiction. Denzel Washington's performance kept me with him the entire time, scene after scene, watching him plunge, recover, plunge, recover, plunge....and then in a memorable public confession, recover in a crash-landing that skidded to a dramatic stop leaving him broken but the hero, at last, that I hoped to see.
1451695195|3.0|After the deaths of some dear family members, I read two books about Heaven. One I found inspirational, the other I thought poorly written and so I wrote my own story of Heaven to share with my daughters both to give them a place to imagine us living on happily in the Great Beyond and later, to ease their fears when it came time to join us. I had refrained from reading others' accounts of Heaven until I was finished with my story and so I was eagerly awaiting the good doctor's book to see how it compared. Imagine my dismay when it became evident that in many ways he had lived my story.<br /><br />  From the depression he suffered beforehand, to the inexplicable altered state of consciousness, the seven days of the coma, the virtual reality tour of Heaven, the idea of a message being passed on (mine came to me in a dream), the almost identical words he spoke as he awoke, the actual writing of his experience, even the neurological background and the set up of the story -- if I hadn't known better even I would have thought I had borrowed the basics of his story. I think that we were even writing them at the same time.  Thank goodness for my daughter who insisted I put it on Kindle so she could access it more readily and so it went up a month before I had ever heard the doctor's name.  But I did wonder if I really wanted to read his book after all.<br /><br />  But, of course, I did. I found his actual vision of Heaven to be much different than the one I patterned my story on and I found his book to be less hopeful even if, potentially, more real. He seemed more intent on the neurology and proving the truth of his experience than in providing a sense of wonder that might inspire others. I wondered as I read it if he was really trying to convince himself as much as his audience. It was a scientific view written by a scientist.  And so much science and so much medicine...the mystical part of it almost worn away under the weight of it all-even though it was somewhat convincing.  But if the ultimate purpose behind his journey was to affect the scientific community -then it would seem to have been successful in fulfilling that mission.  For me, however, it was the picture of his sister that gave me pause.  As a scene in a story the recognition should have been instantaneous and the fact that it wasn't may argue for the reality of the experience. But, could he have been looking so hard for something to latch onto that over time the picture became familiar and his brain attached her face to his visit and she became his guide? Brains can be funny that way so there is no way to know for sure. Proof or not, a reader will believe that which best fits his mindset and I don't think this book will make believers of anyone who is not already predisposed to take that leap of faith.<br /><br />  One reviewer asked what does this book inspire the author and others to do? Does it turn us inward to find the spark of love and light in ourselves and stop there? Or does it encourage us to look for that spark in others and reach out to them creating a more purposeful life of service, whether it's service to each other, service to the world, or service to God? My story, although fiction, encourages the latter and shows how her experience changes her life and the lives of those others whose lives she touched. In my mind it is not enough to believe that Heaven exists if it does not inspire us to live better lives in the here and now.  I am not as sure that his book does this.<br /><br />  I was inspired by the vision of Heaven as revealed in the book [[ASIN:0854351647 Testimony of Light]] and I would heartily recommend the reading of it. The vision of Heaven it contains feels real and makes sense and left me with a feeling of hope for us all. And although I wrote my story for my family, you are more than welcome to read it.  It is called [[ASIN:B009BABHNY Of Hope...Of Heaven]] and is on Kindle as inexpensively as I could make it. It is but a pale shadow ofthe Heaven I hope to find. But, ultimately, it is my belief that whatever Heaven is or isn't doesn't change the importance of the life we are living now. We do the best we can with what we have, helping our fellow travelers when we are able, with the hope that, in the end, it will all have meaning in our personal lives, in the greater world...and beyond. Wishing you much happiness in your journey!!!

B002EEP3NO|5.0|My grandsons, age 11,twins,  have been playing a building with LEGOS since they were very small.  This was a big birthday for them and I went for a home run with STAR WARS DEATH STAR.  I know the box says age 14 and up but let me tell you, these two kids jumped on the box and within 4 days, there it was, done.  A big thrill for every one ...
0679805273|5.0|Great book. A Dr. Seuss classic. Wonderful graduation gift.  I gave it to my grandson to have important educators in his life write in it.<br /><br />Excellent service from supplier.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Waiting for season three and four.  There are a few scenes that seem to have been cut that would carry the story line forward.  This is supposed to be the full unedited version, so lets blame it on the director's cut.<br /><br />At any rate, this is supposed to be serious drama folks - but it's turning into a comedy!  Upon watching the second season - people return from the dead that had died in the first season!  I've heard this story line years ago.....  Yes, Yes..... it's coming back......Bob & Ray's wonderful \\"Mary Backstage Noble Wife\\".  Great scenes and actors, but maybe the viewers should write the script for season four.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. Completely engaging to say the least. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy a clever crime book.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I just started watching this series and I love it so far.  I started watching this after finishing &#34;The Wire&#34; and it is a great departure from the seriousness of streets of Baltimore.  It is a little soap opera-esque at times and melodramatic but I enjoy that the creators don't take the show too seriously to have a bit of fun.  It's a good, face-paced show with a lot of action and intensity that leaves cliff hangers at the end of every episode.
0131103628|5.0|As expected, the book was an excellent read. Everyone who deals with C-like languages should read this book if they haven't. Unfortunately however, the print quality could be better. The book looks like it's a scanned copy. The text is still legible but could be sharper. Paper quality isn't poor but isn't textbook quality (which is somewhat expected).<br /><br />Overall, the book is great but the publisher needs to do a better job or printing it.
B000WQW988|5.0|What a brilliant masterpiece in such a short time.  This concert really shows how Kurt was evolving as a musician with an acoustic style of grunge which will never get old.  Never a bad decision to buy this show, it allows us to keep him in our hearts.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As a history teacher, I am currently teaching this time period.  I love watching the information that I am teaching come to life.  I am going to use some excerpts (trench warfare) in my classroom.  I can't wait for season 4!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout for all levels of fittness. I got bored with the lower levels even though I wasn't fit enough to move on to the higher level but I tried it anyway and there is a low impact version of all three levels.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|i saw this movie for the first @ my family get together and i wanted my own copy. Great Flick.
B0041G683W|1.0|Although the performance is good, I expected the 25th anniversary that aired in PBS to be on this disc.  I was sorely disapointed.
B000T1CPIK|4.0|I love RW and I love swing music, so I was going to love this CD, barring any imperfections of audio. There were none. It's pure enjoyment and entertainment!
0679809015|2.0|I was expecting it to be a bit more, and the parts of the book that open up were easily torn out by my daughter.
B00973DDN2|5.0|With MP3 credit form Amazon, the whole album cost me $3, and it's a lot more value than I should get for that price. The download was speedy and easy, the quality of the audio is great, and well, if you're a Killers fan, you'll love it. If not, you'll still enjoy some of the faster-paced songs on the album. They have an anthem-like quality.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Easy to understand, great graphics, smooth running. I really enjoy playing this game. Unlike similar games it is challenging but still able to see the object s.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|Good little romance movie. I liked all of the different relationships that were going on. Great cast. Heart warming, drama best of all some laughs.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|It works great because I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and not everyone has Blu-ray and some of the guys never seen it.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Argo was a very good movie. Ben Affleck did a great job acting in this movie. Really should have won best director for sure. A suspenseful movie. Really liked Allen Arkin and John Goodman in this movie as well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Having been born in 1959, I was able to relate to the era I only caught the tail end of. Thank you Stephen King for once  again providing a thought provoking and utterly entertaining novel and adding the  word \\"obdurate\\" to my vocabulary! Well done!
B00406UK7S|5.0|The movie had lots of action as what was left of the 9th tried to get back to the roman controled frontier post,
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|A different take on a great action flick, acting is good the action is great. Keeps you interested for the whole film.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|I use my tab as GPS navigator so I can't put it in the rotating case cover I used to have. I bought this sleeve by hoping the best and happy to report that it really fits well (snag fit). I have screen protector and tpu skin but I can easily take out and put back. I bought this from Warehouse Deal (amazon's used item) and is in great clean condition. I also bought [[ASIN:B005K2XY88 Timbuk2 Kindle Fire Plush Sleeve with Memory Foam for impact absorption, Black/Grey (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)]] and it fits too but a lot more padded compared to this \\"360 degree protection\\" sleeve. This is great when I have smaller hand bag.<br /><br />Just wish both are water resistant. I kept my sleeve in the tote and my water bag, similar to sleeve and is fold-able, broke. Luckily, I noticed right away and took out the tab before getting wet. I paid less than $6 for each of these sleeves.
B004XQO8JG|4.0|This is a great 80's action film.  Anyone who loves the old school action films should like this and the price  cant be beat
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|A die hard horror fan my entire life I've come to understand that for film to genuinely frighten people is something easier said then done. Tired of the same formulas being re hashed over and over it was with some hesitation we streamed the aptly named \\"Sinister\\".<br /><br />This is one terrifying movie, a story well told and an instant classic. The cast is superb and performances are top notch all the way around. However, it's Ethan Hawke in perhaps his best performance since \\"Before the Devil Knows you're dead\\" who carries the film in a tour de force performance as unsolved murder case writer  Ellison Oswalt who  when asked early on in an interview if he would ever write for money exclaims \\"I would rather cut off my hands\\". We learn quickly  that this isn't entirely true as he willingly puts his wife and two young children in harms way.<br /><br />Hawke's descent into some gray fog between terror and madness has a surgical precision to it -- and it's riveting to watch. \\"Sinister\\" doesn't waste time as Cinematographer Chris Norr creates an ominous and disturbing world of shadow and light, and the feeling of being watched is palatable. Director and Co Writer Scott Derrickson avoids the expected and cliche' like the plague. Coaxing genuine performances he understands that an audience has to connect with the actors on screen and we do and we do at an almost visceral level. This is smart, terrifying story telling.<br /><br />Aside from a bit of blood splatter there is no gore here and fans of splatter films are sure to be disappointed because \\"Sinister\\" does have one pre requisite - it requires you to think an demands you let go. The horror in terms of violent atrocities are suggestive and that too is smart. The greatest horror films that have stood the test of time knew this. They banked on it. The directors knew that nothing, absolutely nothing on the screen can compete with the imagination and that to try is to fail.<br /><br />Roger Ebert whom I have great admiration and respect for was disappointed that the demons identity is revealed so early in the film. But I disagree. In \\"Fallen\\" we know very early in the film the demon is Azazel, in \\"The Rite\\" we learn almost immediately  Anthony Hopkins is possessed by a demon named Baal and of course the early introduction of the big cheese himself  - Satan - makes an appearance early on in many films including such legendary classics as the Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby.<br /><br />\\"Sinister\\" is not so much a film of possession, it doesn't drag in the over played Church versus Demon formula that requires you to believe in God for any chance of absolution from the terror unfolding on the screen. It's a deliberate and welcome choice.<br /><br />Impressive cameos by both Fred Thompson as sheriff and an uncredited performance as a famous professor of the occult is wonderfully played by accomplished actor Vincent D'Onofrio. A Solid cast, un nerving and deeply disturbing \\"Sinister\\" is a haunting and impeccable made film.<br /><br />\\"Sinister\\" shows us that things really do go bump in the night and the dire consequences when we bump back.on and respect for was disappointed that the demons identity is revealed so early in the film.

B008KMHFJY|5.0|Love Love Loved this book.  I just couldnt put this down and you just needed to know what was going to happen next.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was a pretty good book but I must say I liked the movie better even though the book did have a couple better things.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book!! I choose 5 stars because it was a great book. The only thing I don't like is I've gotta wait for the next book if there is one. I recommend this book to everyone who's into these kind of things.
B009MO5E10|4.0|It was good fast paced.  It kept you going through out.  It is a keeper.  Keeps you interested throughout the whole movie.
B005CRQ4OW|3.0|Great but the end could use some work especially with Rowley the jerk if you ask me he owns him
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Originally I thought this was going to be a kid's movie but I was never more wrong.  It was an amazing experience that I plan to view over and over again.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|It's addictive but I kept running out of &#34;energy&#34; and had to play frequently throughout the day....and if you aren't connected to wi-fi or don't have Facebook linked to it, your options are limited. There are too many times people died or places didn't get built because I couldn't connect to a network and I never did figure out how to hook it up to my Facebook.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsessed with this game.  it is so much fun and works great on my kindle fire. if they come out with an updated version I would be willing to pay for it.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|This app gets old after 3days I loved this for 3 days then it got old and boring. I wouldn't buy.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Saw it in theatre and then again when it came on Amazon.  One of the best, true to life movies you'll see.<br />Only three main characters.  Steve Carrell was amazing but Merryl Streep was the star.  The woman can convey so many feelings with just her eyes.  Tommy Lee Jones as Mr. Everyman was the perfect counterpart.  You'll end movie feeling great.  Great couple movie, date movie, single movie.  See it, you won't regret it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finished Wool 1-5 and then raced to read this Shift series. Good, solid science fiction at an unbeatable price.
1401937519|5.0|It's one of the most important books I've ever read!  It has changed the way I view life, death, diseases and inspired me to live with freedom!
0425263908|4.0|I was very excited to find this series after finishing the Fifty Shades trilogy.  However, I was surprised at how similar this book was to the first book of Fifty Shades.  It was actually hard to get into and get through because it felt like I was reading the same book with different characters and only very slight differences.  If you can get past that, towards the end of the book, the story does finally start to break off into it's own plot and the characters develop a lot more.  Overall, it was a good read.
0307716988|5.0|A MUST ,GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON IN HIS OWN WORDS AND A COLLECTORS ITEM FOR FANS...
0425263916|4.0|The author does a great job following up the first book and finally branching off into a story that doesn't quite resemble the Fifty Shades trilogy quite so much.  Not surprisingly, the story gets immensely better ones that happens and is more enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this bible.  It has many helpful features.  I like that it will read to you.  Also references.  Very easy to use and it saves your place.  I highly recomend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Touching funny devistating. Possible hidden meanings. Very dark. Addicting series. Wonderful discriptions charecters ideas. Will tead the series again for sure.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|i like the game but  i don,t think you should make us type  to tell you how much we like it
B003H6KRIE|5.0|My husband loves these. It was nice that they cam in a package deal.  Good buy. Great entertainment,  Good buy. Great entertainment,
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Issacson knows how to capture Steve Jobs and his unbelievable technical and artistic contributions to our global society.  If we thought we already knew about Jobs, we did not. A privilege to read. Should be read by all.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) (2012) is a good buy.  My husband loves the entire series of movies.
B00005V7CT|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series.  Gosford Park has all of the intrigue and twists as Downton Abbey.  Also, Maggie Smith will not let you down with her sharp, but entertaining, one-liners!
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. I got it as a FAOTD. Even at $2.99 I would consider it money well spent. The puzzles go from easy to challenging. And then just as you think you're done, bonus puzzles appear and you get to try to improve your solutions to the ones you already solved. I've been playing a few puzzles each day on average, and the game has kept me entertained for weeks now. And I still have not finished all puzzles!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 are a necessary edition to the Downton series.  The character development and class system are portrayed brilliantly, leaving you with wanting to see more.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I got this free and was pleasantly surprised.  You can tell it is written for younger readers but I still liked the characters and the story.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and will be going to the second book.  Appreciate if for what it is.  A fantasy that is not overly burdened in detail but has a nice flow and likeable characters.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I finally got around to reading this book, and I am glad I did. It was well written and gave me a full perspective on Steve Jobs. As I was reading of the history of so many of the products, I only wish I would have been paying more attention at the time! Steve was a true innovator and someone that our generation will never forget.
B0058O84G0|5.0|I did not know what to expect but within the first few pages I was hooked.  The way that the lives of the families from the various continents started to influence each other was well done.  It is not a history lesson but the way the story uses the history is amazing. It was difficult to put down the book as each new page unfolded a new twist to the story.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I just just finished this book and I have to say, it is one of the best, adventurous books I have ever read. I could not put this novel down. I recommend this book to kids who love Greek mythology, adventure, and a good read
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the second trilogy.  They way the story continues with the lives of the children of the characters in the first trilogy is excellent but still we follow the lives of the parents.  The history is well researched which makes the story believable.  This was good entertainment and I cannot wait for the third book.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It so much reminds me of my wife, whom I perodically call Elle.... from the movie. I could watch it every day. Well maybe not everyday.... but I have seen it a bunch. The begining still chokes me up
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love the game. It is the only one I wanted, though, and even after choosing the option of it being the only one I wanted, I am being bombarded every time I turn around to choose other games to play. It is very annoying. Sometimes the game freezes up, but other than having to reset my device, choose no thanks for the other games (some of which keep asking over and over), I have enjoyed taking care of &#34;my horse&#34;. Wish I could give the game five stars otherwise, and am considering removing it if it gets worse on the things that keep popping up while I play it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great story. simply told and an easy read. Being from Appalachia makes it even better for me..that's my home ..it touches my heart...go Katniss!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|It seemed that the only exciting portion of the book was the last 20%.  Most of the time was spent driving around the country setting up the final plot.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The series is getting more and more unbelievable - but is easy to read. There are some more suspenseful sequences but is lacking in the &#34;shock value&#34; department for the intimate scenes.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Just got into Friends a couple years ago. Never saw any of the show while it was on TV. Definitely one of those shows that make you laugh and are always used as references. Now I love it and i'm glad I have the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok, the best book in the world i would highly reccomend this book! It is a book that u would NEVER ever put down!! Thank u Susan Collins!!!
B008476HBM|4.0|This book is very hard to read but made easier with the kindle, great story line, funny in parts too.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is amazing! its very accurate on the time and has a graet volume so I can here it. I don't have an alarm clock so this makes a great one. I'm really pleased with this app!
1475143389|5.0|A really well done guide to getting stronger and leaner.  If you bring the passion to succeed Mike and this book will get you there.  I was thoroughly impressed with the easy to understand nature of the program.  It's all you need to get you going on your way to a better stronger, healthier body. He also followed up with me to see how the program was working, and if I had any questions. Wow, that's impressive, and appreciated. Thanks Mike and good luck to all that embark on the principles this book lays out.
B00B0ZT9NI|1.0|I want my $3 back, and the 2 hours Ben Affleck stole from my life!<br />PBS would have made a much more interesting documentary.<br />Don't believe the hype.<br />If it wins Oscars tonight (2/24/2013), you can bet someone's palm was greased.<br />YUK,
B00005JM4Z|5.0|if your into fast and the furious this is a must have it shows how everybody did after the first movie of the series i recommend this to a fan of the series
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Very moody, thought-provoking movie.<br />As close to American Horror Story (season 2) as anything I've seen.<br />Loved the tension, the intelligence underlying the whole thing.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005R87Q|5.0|this movie states the start of the series a must have for any fan i recommend it for the classic action if your into that kind of stuff
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  It is so well written and the acting is is fantastic.  I love the filming of each scene and the attention to detail.  The characters become part of your family.  I would encourage you to get all three seasons in the series.  My daughter and I had a Downton Abbey marathon!  It was great!
B000HA4WT8|4.0|the movie was great just not really part of the story line for anybody whos into fast and furious you dont see how it adds up intill the end of the movie when dome shows up and races the main protagonist ied say get it if your a fan but dont worry if you have no idea about anything from the series
B000KIPT30|5.0|I've found Behringer to be my go-to brand for these little dac's and splitters. They are cheap and they just work. This one has the added ruggedness of a metal case to boot.<br /><br />I'm using the HA400 to split the headphone signal coming from my AVR so that my wife and I can watch TV without disturbing our baby. Having individual volume controls means no more volume wars with my wife!
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Bought it and it won't download. Friend just let me try it on their device. What a useless purchase. Stay away.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is exactly how I wish all games of this type were. A lot of fun, keeps you interested, no time spent running in circles. Highly recommended.
B000174LVQ|5.0|I loved this CD, great music. I would recommend it to anyone who loves flamenco and Paco's guitar.  Arrived on time, everything worked fine.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's energy on the strings is loaded with electricity and incredible vibe. Her love of her music floods the ears with each note. Serious beats and rhythm laced with sassy emotion make any violin player want to be like her. All you want to do is turn it up and get lost in the music. This is an excellent CD for anyone who revels in the emotion of the violin and gets super-charged by new-age-type music. Can't wait for Lindsey Stirling to create another CD.
B0000046MM|5.0|Loved the music , I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves guitar or learns to play guitar. Collection of the best music pieces
B001GCUER0|5.0|My reasons for buying this set is the sames as the reasons form the first set, plus now I am really hooked on it.
B00908DDZM|5.0|CD was brand new, I haven't stoped listening to it!<br />No complaints from me.  Usually on a 15 song  album you only like a few songs... I love them all!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Series was suggested by my son.  I am enjoying re-living the events of the 60's as I would have been the same age as the characters in this series.  The cars, style of dress, household furnishings, political events, WOW, I really, really enjoy it.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Great product! Includes full concert with many beloved songs, some commentary. Very well made! Makes you want to play it at the highest volume!!!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I enjoyed everything about season two. The big battle scene alone was great and so unexpected. I would recommend this to anybody that enjoyed season one.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Follett's previous historical novels,Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, are both absorbing reads with believable, well-developed characters. Fall of the Giants is not. I found myself being so bored with several of the major characters and historical events, that I skipped and skimmed pages and pages of the novel. Obviously, I will not waste my time or money reading the two sequels.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|Rating: 2.5 stars<br /><br />\\"Everville: The First Pillar\\" is a book that may probably be welcomed by those who read for plot rather than by those looking for more than a mere sequence of interesting events.  Owen Sage and his childhood friends, Anika and Dante, are called upon to save Everville, a world described as \\"somewhere between here and there and sometime between yesterday and another day.\\"  In the past, the inhabitants of Everville, the Fron and its guardians, The Keepers, have been able to protect Everville from the attacks of an evil force they simply refer to as \\"Them.\\"  But this time, emboldened and mysteriously strengthened, Them are about to conquer Everville.  Author Roy Huff does not waste any time in plunging Owen into Everville (he practically falls into it). Unfortunately, his fantasy tale of a world faced with extinction is marred by its telling.<br /><br />The book needs to be proofread more carefully. There are misused words (for example, using \\"board\\" for \\"bored\\" and \\"waste\\" for \\"waist\\"), awkward transitions, inconsistent spelling of names, and constant shifts in points of view.  These are errors that can be easily corrected.  But there are at least two flaws that make the story flat and amateurish and thus, less convincing and satisfying to the readers.<br /><br />First, reading \\"Everville\\" is like listening to a friend recount a 2-hour movie in 10 minutes.  Mr. Huff's narrative leans heavily on exposition. Events are reported and explained. Characters tell what other characters are like.  What baffled me was that the author spent time describing food and buildings in detail, but when it came to characters, they were tagged a few adjectives and then summarily dismissed.  The cave dwellers are described as pessimistic but the reader is not given a chance to see them act pessimistically. The Keeper's pet is said to be a \\"magnificent marmook\\" and-- that's it. Readers have to take that at face value because nowhere they are given a fundamental image or reference from which they can visualize or see what being a magnificent marmook entails.  Actually, to this day I'm still trying to decide whether a marmook is like a dog, like a monkey or what.  Also, because characters are hardly dramatized, the author misses opportunities to create the kind of memorable scenes that would make the characters unforgettable.<br /><br />Second, any English major student knows that if you want to be a serious writer, you are not going to declare that the butler did it when you didn't have a butler in the first place.  And yet, that is exactly what Mr. Huff does in Everville.  To effect the resolution to his story and without establishing precedence, he makes a character show up all of a sudden in the book and then simply announces that he's the \\"bad guy\\".  Discriminating readers will feel cheated by the use of the deus ex machina because it gives the story an artificially contrived ending and reveals a clumsy handling of the plot.<br /><br />Everville and its inhabitants have the potential to attract the attention of readers. They are likable and interesting.  However, Mr. Huff needs to spend time fleshing out the details and most importantly, he needs to study writing techniques and how to apply them.  Only then, Everville may become the place of magic and grand adventures readers would love to return to over and over again.<br /><br />Disclosure: In compliance with the FTC Rule, 16CFR, Part 255, I disclose that the author solicited a review and that the book was acquired when it was on sale for free.  I received no monetary compensation and I was not required to write a positive review.  This review is solely my own opinion.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Gillian Flynn's plotline in Gone Girl is engaging, but ultimately the story turns unbelievable, and by the novel's end neither of the two main characters is likeable, so much so that I didn't care what happened to them.  I would  characterize this work of fiction as initially entertaining but essentially forgettable.
B004FEFS5E|2.0|I love photography and I really like the author. I have been following him in the Adorama/YouTube series. But this book it was kind of a downer for me in terms of the quality of the images when they are tapped in the Kindle reader for iPad. The content is not legible at all!<br /><br />We convert printed publication to eBooks for one of our customers at work, let me tell you... images when double tapped are a big thing for the customer (Government agency)  and the conversion team makes it look real good. And guess what... the books are free to the public.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great out of the box.  My go to when I need to sharpen a kitchen knife or a work knife.  Works well wtih serrated knives, too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I not a huge Facebooker, but it is nice to carry on my device and phone to have it when I need it.
0451232852|5.0|At first glance I thought it would take me forever to read all 985 pages of this hugely acclaimed novel.  Was I mistaken! It sucks you right in.  Moving from storyline to storyline makes it easy to continue reading.  I can't wait to get the sequel!
B008XG1X18|5.0|By far my favorite down time activity.  So addictive.  My dreams have been renewed.  I find myself wanting to take on so many new projects.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I think it should be free. People shouldn't have to pay for an alarm clock app. why must people pay so much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I don't write reviews but this book deserves a review. I just finished the book and my heart is still pounding.
B001C1066E|5.0|What more is there to say? It holds up to 30 dollars in quarters maybe 40. So that's cool. It would be just as fat as Naruto's then.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is fun, but smashing pigs is way more fun than freeing caged birds. The game also seems set up to require power ups to get high scores which is a bit disingenuous for a free app. I still like it!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love Josh Groban and anything he puts out is great. He has a magical voice and I hope he never stops singing.  I was not disappointed.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars and I thought this one was VERY GOOD. Stays in rotation in my car. Isn't good for listening around my toddler, but it's Parental Advisory so what do you expect?
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This is a new group for me, and after hearing the most popular songs on the radio, over and over again,  I just had to order it.  All of the music is original, and I love the use of the voices mixed with  orchestration.  After the grammies, I know they will go far.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just the fact that there is no way to change the font size is bad enough.  I already wear glasses but find the default font size for this app is WAY to small.  Couple that with the inability to see more than 20 or so post in your News Feed, and you have a horrible app.<br /><br />Then, mix in a really, REALLY slow update schedule, and you have a reciped for a bad little app.<br /><br />There really needs to be a way to change how you see things.
0736092269|5.0|I like because it shows a very large list of training options either you have the machines availables or simply dumbbels and bars.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I love this band and this album is no different!  Everything they put out is great as always, and the lyrics are always well written

B007VDN1PA|3.0|This is a relatively fast scanning process but quality is not nearly as good as scanning photo on flatbed scanner.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I especially liked the surprises at the end.  It is my favorite kind of book where good always wins over evil
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm a sucker for sci-fi TV and I watched both seasons over the course of a week. It's pretty well done and has a good mix of the human and intergalactic drama.
B008220C38|5.0|I absolutelty loved this version of Anna Karenina! The way the story was presented on a stage, that was transformed for each scene, was amazing! And those do not see the beauty in the way it was presented lack an open mind. It was genius! The story pulled me in from the first moment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing! so much fun.  challenging but a great time.  if u r looking for an addictively fun game...this is it.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love to get lost in the great storytelling of this series. And great fun to have Shirley join the cast...
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Eye opening account of how things work here in the US, and it's sad.  We need to take control of our food, buy from local farmers and do away with the big corporate dictators.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Anthony Kiedis is a true inspiration. Sharing his struggles with addiction and sobriety was truly touching. I found myself going through so many emotions reading this book. It was funny and sad and enlightening.
B005LAII80|5.0|The Movieproved you can have a movie dominated by great sound that needs no real plot. If you have a great sound system you need this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took me awhile to get &#34;into&#34; the plot, but it turned out to be interesting reading, I did enjoy it!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Fun, kid-friendly movie.  Even better than I expected it would be.  Rented it one time and then bought it; whole family likes this movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this book in one day. enjoyed it and would recommend it to reader of any age. would recommend it to anyone
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|great cd -- i have them all and this is up at the top of my list -- the songs are beautiful
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|wonderful ending. enjoyed this trilogy very much. i would not watch the movie until i had read the books. Enjoyed the ability to use lending library
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I generally don't read fiction, but this book was reviewed widely in newspapers and magazines I like so I wanted to read it for myself. The book is humorous and enjoyable, just as the professional reviewers claimed. But I really found the ending to be dissatisfying. Without giving anything away, think, perhaps, about the ending of Ender's Game. There's all of this plot momentum and it, for me, is just kind of dissipated. But if you're interested, I would say the book is worth a shot.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I do have to admit with Dan Stevens refusing to sign his 4th year contract and causing his very untimely death threw me for a loop.  It did help to understand that Julian Fellows didn't have much choice since the actor didn't want to participate in season 4 he did have to go...and better he went with his relationship with Mary in good order and in tact.  I think people who are watching this series are very much involved with the characters at this point.  I didn't like  Shirley MacLane, although I love her<br />as an actress I didn't care for how she was written in the plot at all.  I also wish Mr. Fellows would quit giving Sybil these looser<br />type lovers...this last one isn't even attractive.  And the Anna/Bates characters need to have a baby or something...that<br />has grown stale.  I do have to say that Dame Maggie Smith is absolutely superb in every way.  I'll be waiting for season 4!
0812550706|5.0|This is a book that never leaves you. Whenever a friend wants a book to read, this is the one I suggest. If you're looking for a good sci-fi book, do not hesitate to check out Ender's Game. While the themes in this book are new, complex, and beautiful, they are presented in such a way that it makes for a quick and rewarding read.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|I watched this movie years ago.  I recently decided to watch it again.  I ended up watching it 3 times.  There are many profound moments that speak to the oneness that we all belong to.  It is a movie worth watching with attention to finding those moments that dissolve separation and bring us all closer in that oneness.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I did not read any of the Harry Potter books, so this was a new author experience for me..honestly, the book was a difficult read for me. The characters were all over the place, not coming together until the end and that was sort of predictable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was my third time reading the book and the last two times I really  it I was 15. I'm 21 now and the book is still incredible, though it has a different meaning now. I recommend this book to any young adult looking for a quick, yet rich read. It is full of  music and YA texts that will make you want to explore. The protagonist, Charlie, is a character whom one can easily relate to. I couldn't put the book down, and like I said, I've read it twice before.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had me feeling all kinds of emotions. First you feel sorry for Amy and sure that Nick is the bad guy. Halfway through the book I found it very hard to like Amy at all. By the end of the book I just wanted to scream \\"What the he'll is wrong with both of you!\\" I really enjoyed the book but the ending left me wanting more.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This music CD was at a great price and the quality of sound was excellent. I love the older music that you can no longer find on the radio. Thanks.
0613722663|5.0|This is a great story about the perfect utopia, but is there such thing?<br />It is as good as it is easy to read. It got short chapters and has a great story.<br />I will recommend everyone to read this book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book as I always do.  I am not an avied reader but I always enjoy books from N. Sparks.  He is such a great writer.
0345803493|5.0|This book is the second in the trilogy.  Read the first before starting on this book.  It is \\"I can't put it down book.\\"  There is intrigue in this book that adds to the growth and development of the characters.  You must read Fifty Shades of Gray before this book to understand who Ana and Christian are and why they respond to different events as they have in this book.  The writer keeps the reader on the edge of ones seat.  This could be read by both sexes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In the next update I think you should be able to have dogs.you also need more items you can craft. Also make people able to join your server and you to join them I also think you should add slimes. Near Christmas time I think you should have a Christmas edition were Santa delivers presents to you if your naughty you get coal and if not you get presents and you can make decorations like a star. I hope you put some of those requests in the next update
0345803507|5.0|This book is the third in the trilogy.  Read the The first two.  Have an open mide and don't get hung up in Ana and Christian's passion for one another.  They are just freer and less hung up about it.  Enjoy the Trilogy but start with Fifty Shadys of Gray and don't miss reading the second book either.  You will find a lot of intrigue.  As for the people saying there is a lot of the same in all three book you are missing the growth and development of the characters.  Ana from college and innocent to a very wise woman.  Christian to very closed off his way or no way to very open relationship.  All which was a struggle during the metamorphorsis. Great read for both sexes and great for discussion.
B00785P2QC|2.0|its a good game to conquer boredom. i dont like how your city doesnt generate money unless you have app open.
B008EKOO46|5.0|Reading this book is like attending a series of lectures by an eminent anthropologist.  You may not agree with all of his ideas, but that's what science is all about: take in what the professor has to say and, if you're still interested, move your research to the next level.  Check other sources, see what other scientist say about the subject.  In The World Until Yesterday Jared Diamond compares the traditional and urban societies, and what those societies can learn from each other.  As in his previous books Diamond's writing is excellent, well thought out and very readable for both the professional scholar and the interested layman.  How do people in traditional societies live, get along with their neighbors, treat their children and elderly?  How does that compare with our urban life style?  Where did religion come from and why is it necessary?  Are the strangers you meet friends or enemies?  Whether people live in a hunter-gatherer village, a farming community or a large urban city they all face various kinds of danger on a regular basis and they each have a variety of ways to deal with those dangers.  In a multilingual world communicating with your neighbor can be a problem.  How do we address that problem?  What's the best way to learn a different language?  Should we even try?  And what about warfare?  Different societies have different reasons for going to war and a variety of ways to avoid that step.  What can urban societies learn from the traditional ones and vice versa?  Diamond presents the results of his extensive field work  in New Guinea as well as the research done by other workers in such far flung places as: Australia, the Arctic, North and South America. The conclusions that he arrives at are somewhat controversial and his research methodology has come under fire from some critics, and a few of his colleagues as well.  The resulting academic debate may go on for some time.  Are there some elements of traditional societies that can prove useful tothose of us in urban societies?  What about the reverse?  Could some elements from either society prove harmful to the other side?  According to Diamond the answer to both questions is yes.<br />I had no technical problems with this Kindle edition.<br /><br />LastRanger
0141040378|5.0|I love the collectors edition of this book! It is beautifully crafted and stands out brightly. Jane austen transfers us from our current traditions to her English Utopia. Who wouldn't want to go?! I will read and re-read this book for the rest of my life and wish I could play the piano as accomplished marianne can or budget the household economy as aptly as Elinor and climb trees and lie atop of an atlas' as Margaretdoes dreaming of advebtures. Exceptional book. [[ASIN:1478718498 The Fifteen Houses: A Novel]]
B0065IA4F2|1.0|I bought this item because it was 25 cents. Seriously. A quarter. I don't know how it was that cheap because this guy was probably near the height of his popularity. I listened to it once and thought, well, that was nothing worth going back to. If you are a teenager you might like this because all your friends do. I am a thirty year old man and I want my quarter back.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Masterfully acted with some of the finest English actors. Renee plays the character impeccably. You will recognize a lot of other accomplished actors as well. Beatrice is such an inspiring woman, especially to authors like me who spent their childhood chatting with furry creatures and living in a bit of an imaginary world. I bought the movie and watch it several times a year! [[ASIN:1478718498 The Fifteen Houses: A Novel]]
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Citizen Kane is ranked above this, but to me, that is only because it was precocious in its techniques. This film is unbeatable. It is like perfection on film. It can only be equalled.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good game,  graphics are good,  not happy to have to pay to finish a game. Free should be free.  If you open a book make sure you check if the pages can be turned,  the bottom of the page will be dog eared.  all in all fun game.
1250007208|5.0|After not reading a fairy tale re-telling for a loooong time,  I picked up Cinder with a bit of a clean memory, nothing to really compare with. I was uber-excited to start reading this. The reason it took me so long to bother borrowing this was because I was warned of annoying cliffhangers...so now that I have Scarlet, I began.<br /><br />As far as I know, fairy tale re-tellings can only go two ways. 1) Epic fail, too cliche and predictable, not original in any aspect. And 2) Holy cow! Amazing, just filled with beautiful writing. Fortunately, Cinder falls in the latter. Cinder, not only promises a fantabulous re-telling/premise, but also offers a strong female character, cute romance and killer world building. I guess Cinder is what you get when dystopia and fairy tale re-tellings clash. BOOM! There is a smashing book awaiting.<br /><br />Cinderella has always been a big favourite fairy tale of mine at a young age, so I set the expectation extremely high. Even so, Marissa Meyer manages to pull of something breath-taking! And just something else...I love this cover!!!!!!! O__O I really love the red shoe and how we can see through the foot to the mechanical parts. So awesome!<br /><br />Cinder is one excellent kick ass heroine. Yeah, she has quite  a lot of bad karma and misunderstandings throughout her life but she stays strong, clear minded, and most importantly, pure to herself. I feel like I cannot describe her exactly, because she is pretty much one of the best feminine characters I've ever come across, sometimes, I just wanted to grab her out of the book and give her a good big hug. Prince Kaito should not be thought of as stuck up, sophisticated royalty. Kai is in fact the most adorably caring and thoughtful person EVER. Especially to Cinder. I love you both!! *kisses book*<br /><br />Let's talk about world building, and plot planning. Both get two fat, sloppy ticks next to it. Though I felt the world building could have had some dusting up, both were stunners.This book is set in New Beijing, with a world of cyborgs and Lunars, which are really well thought out, I loved the ideas that Ms. Meyer created to make this book so successful.<br /><br />Here is a book with cute, yet awkward romance that has no stupid love triangle. Kai and Cinder are a match made in heaven, really. It was most certainly not over powered and it also didn't seemed forced or too icky. Heart-breaking and beautiful romances are totally down my ally.<br /><br />Before, I said Cinder had bad karma, and she does. Thanks to lovely twists and unexpected shocks, I was left unguarded with shockers every now and again, just when you are starting to think that it's boring, BAM. Right there. It really makes this book more loveable.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to amaze you, Cinder will be the best choice I can think of right now. It contains everything from romance to plotting which are set to perfection. Now...I'm coming for you Scarlet!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I kept thinking these books are just pure escapism my 14year old grandson loved.  How could a senior like me think they were worth the time? But I become enthralled with the inventiveness and the characters. This trilogy is an easy read. It also transports you into a world that symbolizes just how crazy and horrible the quest for power can become. The only redemption is being truly human and understanding that life has a way of going on. Taking the time to read these books might feel like a guilty pleasure but don't we all deserve pleasure sometimes?
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome,  if it gives you trouble at first delete it and download again. Its worth the trouble. All the dinosaurs from the movies...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Never thought about Dom/Sub... but it may be something to try.  The boyfriend has agreed to read the book now!
B005MMY534|1.0|This was terrible. Morgan was a terrible actress, the rest of the acting was overdone. Wish I could get my money back.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I reread the book after seeing the movie.  Whispersync is a good way for a fast read.  The movie was great, but the book is better.  Two thumbs up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun once you start you can't quit only thing it needs is he needs to rum faster and faster also more levels that would be great
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Enjoyable reading about literature and reading. The plot is masterful. I think this is one of McEwan's best work. Highly recommend it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The app is lots of fun. A 3D mahjong matching game. The graphics work flawlessly. Each game takes about 8-10 minutes. I am getting better and can now complete a game in 7 minutes.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is exactly the kind of case that is perfect (IMO) for the Kindle.  It is lightweight enough that it isn't cumbersome to hold or travel with, but it is durable enough to take a beating.  I have unfortunately dropped my Kindle a few times with this cover on and it proves to be resilient.  The flap to cover the front that doubles as a stand is handy; I do wish it was slightly more rigid.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good account of the event. Recommend for others to read and find out about what happened. It's about who made it happen.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|I had this movie when I was younger and absolutely loved it! I recently found it and my VHS was completely destroyed (a box must have fallen on it in our basement). I was so happy I could find it on here on DVD! Brings back great childhood memories!
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I don't think he adequately proved his hypohesis, but it is interesting reading.  It DOES give one food for thought and conversation - if not necessarily convincing one of the accuracy of his conclusion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book. Every page was better than the next. If the movie is this good, it will win many awards
B0049985XW|5.0|All is well and you guys are wonderful. Keep up the good work. I haven't seen the film yet and I am sure I like it. So far so good.

1451695195|2.0|I think the entire book could have been summed up in just a few sentences.  In comparison to other NDE's, this one seemed very imconplete.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This is a great film which won the Oscar for best documentary.  Everyone should see this movie.  It's truly exceptional.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This film is marred by a couple of gigantic plot holes, and it's not a very satisfying prequel to Alien. I think also that I've never seen another film that's more clearly intended to set up a sequel; even the Harry Potter movies provide more closure at the end. In spite of the problems, though, Ridley Scott is such a master of making gorgeous-looking cinema that it's worth watching. Michael Fassbender's performance as the childlike android is also a highlight.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Although the subject matter can be disturbing and sometimes hard to read, it's well worth your time. Great for book club discussions.
B004T340QY|5.0|What can I say about this one? This is a fine example of the Coen brothers' fascination with the idea of unstoppable evil, and it makes good comic relief after a viewing of the similarly themed, but utterly grim, No Country For Old Men. You can watch it again and again and it never gets old. The soundtrack is also one of the greatest in all of cinema.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I loved the story, and the chase between Abby and Travis in the beginning.<br />What I hated was the self pity Abby carried around. It was so annoying.<br />I felt bad for Travis through this whole book because of how incredibly selfish Abby was.<br />After their first trip to Vegas I completely understood why Abby wanted to walk.<br />But because Travis was actually trying to move on Abby wasn't okay with it.<br />HE TELLS her you broke my heart and she still carries on with her nonsense<br />and let's America mistreat Travis as well. I was like, oh my God grow up Abby.<br />ABBY was just a mixed character for me. I liked her and then hated her.<br />In reality there is no possible way Travis could have trusted her to stay with him.<br />It's not possible. ABBY was constantly trying to run and then come back and<br />act shocked that Travis didn't believe she would stay.<br /><br />I just don't know. I want to say it was good but honestly Abby's character<br />just made it so hard, Travis loved her and did anything for her, and literally<br />walked through fire but still still<br /> looked for his faults. I would rather read America and Shepleys story.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Does everything have to be a fairytale of love that's over-rated. The intro into the whole plot was long and boring, where common sense is a ? Like if  put in a deadly situation, the touch gets going and get it over. Not what shall I do now.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Solid performance, good bios setup and nice IO options. My only complaint is that all the usb ports are 3x power which doesn't always work great with my sound card (saffire 6)
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|Some action scenes where batman is fired at, with machine guns at close range and not getting hit and him being an old man does not register. I had problems with those scenes.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|probably about 20+ different white noises and I havent heard the loop on most of them.  My friends use the dishwasher to put their baby to sleep, and they love it.  Mine seems to like the Tabetten meditation bowl, though she also tries to levitate with her bowl movements.  Some neat ones I enjoy as well such as train tracks.  There is one for airplane as well, but that gives me nightmares being a large man in a tiny seat.

B00AATV046|5.0|This is a great Christmas movie, and Cary Grant makes a gorgeous angel. I plan to watch it every year.
0756665949|2.0|This is really more of an overview of \\"Lost\\" than an actual encyclopedia.  I have seen the show numerous times, and I am actually a tour guide, taking people to locations in Hawaii used through the show.  I talk to people about Lost every day, and am somewhat of an authority on the show.    That being said, when I bought the book, I was excited to read it, but when I started to page through I found a few glaring mistakes:    1) The book is poorly edited, with numerous typographical and grammatical errors throughout.  2) The book is poorly organized.  Supposedly it is alphabetized, but many things are out of order.  3) The main problem is that there are MANY factual errors throughout the book, many of which leave you wondering, \\"Did this author actually watch the show?\\".  There are also many glaring omissions, such as no entry for important side and flashback characters, and worst of all, absolutely NO mention of the \\"whispers\\".. one of the big mysteries of the show.  The errors and omissions are listed here: [...]    Overall, if you are a big fan of the show and want to learn the ins and outs of the mythology, I recommend immersing yourself in [...]and don't waste your money on this hastily thrown together rag.

B0096PAA6E|5.0|Black and Blu is one of the best albums I own. The entire album is thumpin', jumpin', humpin' music.  I don't find many albums that are excellent from start to finish. Clark reminds me of a cross between Jerry Lee Lewis and John Mayall. Clark's music is now the theme song for ABC's Body of Proof. The producers of Body of Proof made an excellent choice choosing his music for their theme song.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This book was very good, except I think Xander should  have been in the story more. The book could use<br /> some work.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This version of Jane Eyre reminds me all over again of the importance of good casting. The production values are excellent, a lot of attention was paid to historical accuracy (including the dimness of pre-electricity mansions!), and views of the countryside are magnificent. But the story itself is not emotionally satisfying. Michael Fassbinder is currently a hot, popular and well-reviewed actor, which is why he was hired to play Mr. Rochester. Readers, Rochester he ain't. The problem is not just with Fassbinder's appearance, although he doesn't physically resemble Bronte's Rochester.He looks wrong.  Edward Rochester's darkness is referred to often in the book--his black hair, dark eyes and dark complexion--and for Bronte they symbolized his precious \\"apartness\\" from conventional English blondness, and also his spiritual darkness before Jane entered his life. And Bronte's Rochester, beneath his gruff exterior, has a good and kind heart. Fassbinder's Rochester is not just arrogant, he's chronically rude, selfish and indifferent to the suffering of others. Fassbinder has no feeling for Rochester's genuineness of character, the depth of perception that ties him to Jane.His playing of the role is shallow, even condescending. Bronte's Jane would not have loved him. And there goes the whole story.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This case fit my Kindle just right. I am well pleased with the fit, weight, and appearance. I would recommend it to my friends.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This season and show is a must see!!!! The first season starts off a little slow but if you make it to the end of this season will thank yourself.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Looks like a kid and sings like a pro. Never ceases to amaze. Sure to be one of his best.
B003U51EE8|5.0|Great way to exercise great show love the story line gets better each season. Watch this show you will love it
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I could listen to this artist all day long. Most are classics in Spanish or English. Makes me wish I could speak Italian.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|I have bought this book for my daughter originally when she had questions about death and dying. She found this book had answered many of the questions that she had and it gave her great comfort. I too found comfort in the reading of this book and have read it over the years a number of times. I have bought this book a number of times to give to people who were struggling with the death or dying of a loved one. It has been a blessing for many.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|wouldn't pay to see this again, but would see it on regular television, if nothing better was playing. would not recommend it too a adult.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very clean, humorous family game. Slow to get needed energy but getting friends helps. All GL games can get expensive unless you are patient and earn stuff. Personally, the game journey is what matters to me so that isn't an issue.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I chose this rating because this movies was ok, but I would never order it again, but I may watch it on regular TV, if it was the only movie from a choice of other movies that was worst. I wouldn't recommend this movies to anyone, but if asked, I would say, &#34; the movies is ok, for a child to see, but I don't think an adult will enjoy it very much
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this movie - light-hearted, funny, and full of good music!!  It's one I've watched over and over again!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to others. I've seen all but the last one. waiting to be able to order it. I would, and have recommended it to others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This adventure was incredible. A true surprise and a real terror for my imagination. The world of the silos is going to haunt me forever! :)
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I didn't enjoy this as much, I love most of, or should I say, the ones I have seen with the actor Liam Neeson  as lead. He is one of my favorite actors,  but I think this movies wasn't one that show cased his talents. He is way to talented to be in a movie such as this. The most important  thing I like about this actor, is that most of the movies I've seen him play in, is he doesn't  use profanity, and there isn't a lot of unnecessary sex scenes. I am a Christian and I do not watch any movies rated (R). As long as he continue making movies the way he has, I will always watch his movies. I would and have recommended  any movies  I know he is playing in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love It my 3 year old granddaughter plays this game all the time. recommend it for all. lots of fun.
0767817478|5.0|I bought this dvd for my son who loves Godzilla. Great movie at a great price! I highly recommend this movie.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|It's sad at sometimes but at others its action packed and dramatic!! Ya ya ya ya ya yay a ya
0545265355|5.0|My daughter really enjoys these books. This is her second time reading this trilogy. My daughter has never been a reader until I bought these books for her.
B00335EQ0E|1.0|Got this item for my son for Christmas. He decided to watch Cars or Winnie the Pooh everyday instead of this movie. But he saw it today and was so excited to watch it he was dancing. Popped in the movie and it doesn't work! I have tried it on several different DVD players and my computer but with no success. The bonus material works, just not the actual movie. SO disappointed because now I can't return it. I won't be getting any more movies off of Amazon.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Fun game new way to throw  your birds and kill some pigs. It gets boring quickly though and soon becomes a game ou play as a last resort, but when you need that last resort it is fun!
B007G51UV0|5.0|I've found this motherboard to be fully compatible with Windows 7 as well as Linux (Ubuntu 12.10) and am very happy with it so far.  Just one word of caution: when installing, the wifi card needs to be screwed onto the motherboard BEFORE it is installed into the case.  Otherwise you won't be able to reach the screw.  I found this out the hard way (why don't they just attach the wifi card from the factory?)
B003K16P3M|3.0|Starts out ok then slows down then towards the end you start to pick out details that should not be so apparent and it almost stops in the action. Was an okay book.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is simply a great CPU.  It might not be an i7, but paired with a decent GPU it's more than powerful enough for every current game, and it runs cool!
B004G6009K|5.0|I work hard at getting over the story line all the time as it's rather twisted and demented. However, My daughter doesn't know that yet and she enjoys it very much. As do my husband and I.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci delivers again.  The suspense, twists, and intrigue are woven together in a pattern that makes the book hard to put down.  Loved the characters and found their interaction to be a highlight of the book.  If you've never read Baldacci this book will put you on his website anxious to read all his past works.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I kept reading this=and debated several times about not finishing it.  This poor fellow was a misfit;  it seemed he kept associating with other misfits whether he wanted to or not.  I was surprised at his freedom to come and go from his home and often wondered about his lack of parental guidance.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Nice read, 100% Stephen, catching and it makes you doubt all you tought was real.<br />If you like Stephen this is one you should read.
1616550414|5.0|for and Zelda fan out there. Such an absolutely amazing book, I could spend hours through it and never get bored.
B0046ECJBY|4.0|This is a superb read for anyone who wants to better understand the possibilities for U.S./Chinese relations going forward.  Mr. Kissinger was, as an author, recommended to me by a senior State Department official on tour in Afghanistan.  I was looking for some reasonably evenhanded discussion on modern diplomacy and it's apparently ever increasing role in world affairs when the nuclear mass destruction is available to more and more governments.<br /><br />This was actually a page turner as Mr. Kissinger did a wonderful job of explaining the Chinese world view of it's exceptionalism over its long history, and how that world view integrates with and sometimes bumps into the American (western) world view of it's exceptionalism.  Looking for a scholarly work in this area?  This book meets the mark.  Looking for a just a good solid read?  This book also meets the mark.
0802473156|5.0|If you feel at all like you lack the ability to love someone the  &#34;right&#34; way, this book will certainly help indeed. I feel so much more able to love those around me as I now have a better understanding of how people want to be loved. I loved reading this book and really desire more people to read it. It truly is and inspired lecture.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Product works great. I plug in my hdmi cable to it and plug the other end to the tv. Then I plug this devise into my iPad and it displays it on the tv. Very happy.

B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This light is very bright and at a good price.Also the switch will let you turn it off, on or auto on and off.
0525478817|3.0|This book was nice but I'm not sure if it really deserves all the hype.....I was expecting something AMAZING and MIND BLOWING. Of course the subject matter is very touching and heartbreaking but it was just lacking that 'WOW' factor for me personally...
0547884591|5.0|This book will teaching more than cooking. Don't get me wrong, it will teach you to be a cook, but the lessons in cooking can be applied to almost anything you want to learn. The art of learning is invaluable.
0385738765|5.0|What can I say? Mr Dashner has done it again. Not as wonderfully epic as The Maze Runner but as far as sequels go it was excellent. I am excited to read The Death Cure.
B009329Y30|2.0|I do not recommend this film. There is language and other stuff that I could do without. Also, some bad acting by the main characters. However, this story was believable and it was very serious about respecting the military veterans, I think.
0385737955|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. Completely original and definitely a page turner from beginning to end.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle  ( when it worked ) ...Great book !!! I would definetly reccommend  it
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game and it is so fun just occasionally it randomly forgets the scores so I recommend it but if it forgets your scores don't be surprised./
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game is simple and straight forward. However, it's also full of bugs that make it difficult to enjoy the social aspect of sharing gifts and visiting, that can cause the loss of daily bonuses and the reset of purchasing items, and even that interfere with the mini games. I still like and play this game, but Hasbro has a lot of work to do. the quality is not up to what the show deserves.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I had been bought a cheap turntable to play my LP's from back in my college days and it really didn't work so this was something of a gamble but it paid off big time and I love everything about this turntable, although to be fair I only use it in the old fashioned way to play the records and have not attempted to transfer anything to other media.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I played It for less than twenty minutes, and I found out that you get like ten minutes to play! You can't do anything. It stinks. Pay for the real minecraft and apologize to it for playing this garbage. This is horrible.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game to play, have had a ton of fun playing so far. I would recommend this game to everyone!!
B009JBZH54|4.0|The pack is incredible. It arrived on time and it was shipped carefully. The BD menus were static or the movie just started. That was the only thing I dislike. Thanks amazon
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and the plot. The thought process that went into intertwining all the pieces in the book was very well-thought out. It was a little too heavy on the make out moments for me, but I enjoyed it otherwise.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's very very helpful. l use it all the time.When ever need help l use it.with my school work .
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|Only One Word Needed=GREAT! LOve that funk + bonus of no singing! Can't stand it, can't wait to see their (singing ) world falling down.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I bought this on the strength of reviews.  It took a couple of episodes to get into the Firefly universe, but I really enjoy it.  Too bad there are only 14 episodes.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Awesome movie and recommend it other people who enjoy watching motorcycle movies. Alot of great riders in this film. Right on.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I think Grisham does better when he uses complete fiction as he indicates he did with this book.  It is a good read.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I have 5 year old boy and girl twins and they love this game!  They figured it out on their own and play it all the time.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Just as expected.  Great series.  Now just waiting to receive 2nd season.  Can't wait to see the rest.  Almost as good as the books.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite Disney films as a child. I had to get in on Blueray to bring back the memories. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It'll be as good as you remember it.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Argo is the true account (though plenty of artistic license is taken) of six American embassy workers in Tehran who avoided being taken as hostages in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Instead they managed to escape the embassy as it was being overrun and sought refuge in the Canadian ambassador's private residence.<br /><br />Not knowing how to safely extract the Americans, the CIA struggles to come up with a plausible plan. Finally, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) hatches an extraordinary plan: He'll enter Iran disguised as a Canadian filmmaker filming Argo, a cheesy sci-fi screenplay that has been repeatedly shelved by Hollywood studios for years, and have the escaped American embassy workers play his Canadian film crew. When they're done \\"filming the movie\\" the plan is for all of them to simply fly out of the country.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is one thrilling moment after another. A trip to the bazaar by the fictitious film crew turns ugly when the hostile Iranian crowd turns on the white Westerners. The final intense scene at the airport sees the Americans suffer one setback after another as they try to board their plane before the Iranians uncover their true identities.<br /><br />The scene depicting the embassy being overrun on the beginning of the movie was especially chilling because the movie was released just weeks after the Benghazi attack.<br /><br />Affleck should be given tons of credit for his directing abilities and incredible pacing of the movie. He also deserves kudos for not taking this opportunity to preach a sermon based on his liberal leanings (the opportunity was there) or allowing the fiction of the movie to outweigh the facts.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Don't even listen to people rating this game 1 star for over pricing and lots of space. If they were so concerned about that they would wait till now when it takes up less space or it went on sale. Anyways this game is great. I personally liked the story. And after you beat it the free roam is great. There are random gang shootouts 2on 2, and random accidents. This game is great, and a must for getaway lover's.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|leps world is wack and stupid I thought it would be fun it would be better if super Mario flash was on kindle fire. thank you
B004LWZWGK|5.0|a really great film that was made for blu ray.  great colors and sound quality make this .....dont you hate being told how many words you must write.  i mean really,  it's like being in school all over again.  are you going to send home a note pined to my shirt ?
1609611543|4.0|This has a lot of information in it for those that have weight issues. Whether they have allergies to wheat or not. My hubby is reading it first as he has issues with wheat. I would recommend this for all people that are trying to feed their families or themselves the healthiest way possible.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this every winter. It's my favorite book ever. Her sentences are breathtaking and every character is charming.  I feel like I've learned something at the end of the book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The price is more than reasonable for getting the all the various copies,and the show of course is amazing. Love it!
0374214913|5.0|I truly loved the pacing and character development in this story. It was quick and poignant, with just enough mystery to keep me interested, and a cultural undertone that's very germane to the world we live in today.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I absolutely love this game, my friends all picked it up fast and loved it too, we have just got so much entertainment out of it already !
B00003CX5P|3.0|As any good sci-fi mom would, I've raised my four year old on the original Star Wars trilogy hoping he may never ask to see the contemporary prequels.  Well, we all know that was never going to happen, so I did succumb the other day and buy Episode One.  Here's the thing, it's not bad.  It's just not that good either.  It takes FOREVER for the plot to develop, my four year old was already off and doing other things as I kept promising some eventual action like pod racing and jedi martial arts.  Also and I think by design, the lines between the good guys and bad guys are murky...great if you want to make a political statement...terrible if you want to entertain a child.  In summary, it's a fine movie worth watching but don't expect to be blown away and if you are bringing up young ones in the ways of the force...please begin with \\"A New Hope.\\"
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am enjoying the movie. There is wonderful attention  given to details of that time period. Acting is great too.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Go in with low expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised by this sweet, humorous, and mildly exciting movie.  It was a great relief to watch with my three year old as there was no bad language, sex, or otherwise inappropriate subliminal messages.  It has a well developed plot, easy for children to grasp and entertaining enough for parents to enjoy while strolling down memory lane...Saturday morning cartoons with a big bowl of Flintstones cereal...
B0031RS69G|5.0|Terry Pratchett sketches a very imaginative and amusing world filled with a weird and wonderful characters.<br /><br />I you liked the Hitchhiker's Guide books, you'll love this one.<br /><br />I hope the rest of the Discworld Novels are just as amusing.
B004H4XDBI|3.0|I loved the first book, but with such a big time jump in this book it was a little confusing as to what was going on. I feel that it was rushed, and had a very dissapointing ending. Almost as if Forman got bored with the book and started making stuff up towards the end. It's sad that it was like that because these books had so much potential.
B001AITGWE|5.0|this is a really good suspense thriller u dont know whats next fantastic acting and a few stars before they got big
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I think this movie was funny and so cute . some good  , I passed it around for everyone to see .
B0007MWZEK|5.0|her shark died not the fish type but the sweeper this one is great for her light weight for stairs
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I liked this movie because it is something from our past that shows value . More movies like these would improve our country .
B0094K1MH2|5.0|love the story and all the characters<br />full color with the realyistic cortoon images<br />action packed moives are what i love
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Funny and very good for kids , I hate the voilent movies that are given to kids to day , This is a good movie .
B000F6IOC0|3.0|Underworld and Resident Evil are unique in that they are the only film franchises anchored by a female lead; interestingly both leads are European actresses.  Both leads are also known for their attractive good looks, and in this film Kate Beckinsale has one of her few nude scenes in film history; the other being her debut in Much Ado About Nothing.  Outside of this little trivia, this film does little to distinguish itself from the other outings of the Underworld franchise.  The film has lots of action using weapons of various sorts.  There are werewolves, vampires, and a cross between the two that survives death to save the day.  And of course flashbacks of history of the origins of werewolves and vampires, intermingled with the plot in the present day.  Overall, an average action flick; neither great nor boring.
1612680011|5.0|Changes the way you look at your situation!  I have given this to several friends and even a recent high school graduate!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downtown Abbey has a following because of the beauty of the set, the quality of the acting, the fantastic storyline.  Season 3 delivers again on all counts and will leave you feeling at a loss....like a distant family member, you will be anxious for Season 4 in order to visit Downton Abbey again in order to laugh and cry with the characters.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The problems I found with the use of the dictionary was that you're not able to go directly to  the words you are looking for from the go to Manuel.  Also, it would be nice if the dictionary would pronounce the words for you.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is the most moving portrail of Jesus giving up his life on the cross for our sins.  It is so real and true to life, it will bring tears to your eyes for the cruel way he was treated.  I think every Christian should watch this movie.  You'll never be the same!
B0015AARJI|3.0|It seemed like all of my PS3 controllers suffers from this flaw, when playing BF3  and applying pressure on the left Joystick, it will sometimes read that im pressing the right directional pad (D-pad) or it will switch weapons, etc. I've even bought a new controller, i thought that my old one was broken, but the new one suffers from this flaw as well.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|The Lethal Weapon Collection on blu ray is just amazing, here you have all 4 movies in one great package and the picture and sound is clear and great. I give this movie 5 stars because I am a fan of these movies. After watching them all, it makes me wish they made another one.<br /><br />Each movie is so enjoyable to watch and has all the action and laughs that you can ask for. I highly recommend this box set.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Sir Oscar Wilde's tale of a man frozen in his youth through the magic of his portrait.  His journey to corruption which he ultimately blames on the portrait.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie, one of the best Bond movies, would highly recommend, lots of action and suspense. Make sure to get it on blu-ray.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Excellent Stephen King book.  Great story line.  Interesting characters.  Would highly recommend if you're a Stephen King fan. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
030758836X|5.0|I was totally engrossed by this story. I found myself hating the characters, yet I was still invested in them, and by the end they all kind of won me over again. The story and all of its twists are insane and outrageous enough to resemble a Law and Order SVU episode, except that it's REALLY well written. The quality of the writing is superb and the narrator(s) acknowledge how far-fetched the storyline starts to get, which lends some credibility.<br /><br />I did not see the ending coming, either. I feel conflicted about it since it wasn't the ending I was hoping for, but the fact that it surprised me was really satisfying.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow, just wow.  I read this book in one sitting.  It made me laugh, cry, and even made my chest tighten because of either sadness, passion or fear.  It's hard to write words that elicit so many different feelings.  Colleen Hoover has managed to do that.  What a powerful love story and heart felt journey for all the characters.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading another by Colleen very soon!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun but. it takes a long time to get all of them. some of them are hard to play.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and it's still great! A true Classic! Your kids will love it, trust me.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|The season series is gripping viewing. Steve Buscemi and entire cast bring the 1920s to life. Can't wait for the third season series.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great story.  Wonderful characters.  I couldn't put it down!  Although it is the second book in the Pillars of the Earth series, you don't have to read Pillars first, as this is a stand alone book picking up 200 years after the first one.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Honestly it was a well made, fun movie from the start to the finish.  The animation was excellent.  The story was well done and enjoyable for kids and adults.  I was a bit surprised it was this entertaining for an Adam Sandler movie.  I think he needs to stick to kids movies from now on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely addictive. It's a blast to play. I like the new upgrade. I just can't put it down. I love beating my friends high score.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I would totally recommend this game. My kids love it and we play as a family. I like that it has extensions so you can add more as you mater it. It has a long instructions booklet, so even after motnhs we keep finding rules.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know I'll probably get attacked by the lovers of this book. Just remember it's my opinion.<br /><br />I hate this book. I almost quit reading it and had for a few weeks. This book had no plot to me. It was all &#34;don't bite your lip&#34; now we're having sex again. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not opposed to reading porn. I did read Anne Rice's &#34;Sleeping Beauty.&#34; THAT was a good book with great plot. People keep telling me I need to read book 2 in order to get the plot. No. The first book should make me WANT to read book 2. I should be engaged well before book 2.<br /><br />I will say the ONLY parts of the book I enjoyed were the text and email conversations. That was witty. Everything else was dull and boring.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Sometimes the answers to life are not found in a medical textbook or at the hands of a doctor. Some people know this to be true, but Alexander gives the belief a reality because he is a doctor who studies the brain. Because of his knowledge of the brain, he came to know that his experiences were beyond the realm of medical science and more about the true meaning of our conscious existence.<br /><br />Weather you are a believer of the afterlife or not, I recommend this book as it is a great marriage of the personal, the scientific and above all the spiritual from the account of someone who was a skeptic due to his medical knowledge. After his illness, all his medical knowledge was turned on its head.<br /><br />Very interesting read.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Justin Timberlake is truely talented.  I was a fan of NSYNC but I also gained all new respect for Justin Timberlake when he went solo and then even ventured out into the acting side of hollywood.  So often many people try making a transition like that and it kills their career.  Just goes to show that he has pure talent and I am happy to see that.  Also happy that you don't see him in the negative light, as you so often see when young people become so famous, so fast.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Great price for the movie.  This was a Christmas present and the product arrived on the date promised.  My Great niece loves it.
0307744434|4.0|I read this for book club. The book jacket sounded not like something I would like -- magical powers? Not my style. But I was caught up by the sheer imagination of the author.  She has created a world of fantasy entertainment encompassed in a circus that is only open at night, comes and goes without notice, and is filled with memorable characters.
B0052YAKS6|3.0|I like 'Titannium,' but the rest of the music on this CD is just so-so.  Not that crazy about it.
1454901330|4.0|I love the language, the flow, the descriptions, the characters, and the storyline. Emma drove me a little crazy because she always had her nose in someone else's business, but she was adorable at the same time. I love getting sucked into that time period and finding myself a part of it. I also really liked the new cover art of this edition. It is so pretty and feminine.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|i love this show and im glad i can still find it..wish it wouldnt of ended...came packaged nicely and would buy from again..came on time and was just what i ordered
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Gorgeous amazing scenery, Emile Hirsch is great in this.  Awesome overall cast.  Beautiful message.  I Iove love love this movie!
B004WR125O|5.0|This is a must for any Onkyo Reciever and you don't want to run a Cat5 cable through your walls and your wirless device has good coverage.
B000NY12LO|5.0|A good book. Depressing at times and some what predictable but I liked it and would recommend it to anyone!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really liked this game. I was worried about spending the money to continue past the free teaser, but I am glad I did.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun app! looks great on my kindle fire. I hate those things that chase you though - yikes! overall - lots of fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy to get the idea, lots of fun after that!<br />Good for both the young and grown up!<br />Helped getting many hours go by on the plane :)
B0000041Z5|5.0|Sir Georg Solti, CSO, German music from the Romantic period, is this music ever done better? Not for me. As their slogan says today, World's Best, Chicago's Own. Maybe you don't agree, but no one thinks they're not among the best. This is a great example.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome app, but mojang, I would suggest that you add minecarts, and tracks and that sort of stuff like transportation, that would truely make our possibilities endless.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|This first came out in 1993.  Very happy to have the blu-ray version of the movie.  The audio as well as the video was improved.  Not very many extras in this version.  Warning, it is about 4 hours long.  Great if you love the details of this battle, long if you want just a quick summery of this 3 day long battle.
B002NT3B52|3.0|Good book, lots of examples, except - when my dog gives me a kiss, I just don't think she is hoping I'll throw up to share my last meal.  I just happen to believe there is a little more affection there then simply a wild animal's behavior, and the author is much more focused on alligning domestic dog behavior with their ansestors' behavior.  But I am not a scientist.
1616550414|5.0|It all makes sense now! This book is worth every single penny that I spent on it! I now understand the series and enjoy it even more.
B002ZG9940|1.0|This movie was just plain terrible! It was pointless and watching it, was like watching paint dry. Clooney hardly speaks, everything was predictable, nothing made sense or was explained. It was just a complete waste of time. The one interesting thing I did want to mention is that throughout the movie, director Anton Corbijn shows everything done so methodically and wants to be as realistic as possible, however Clooney is seen driving on the left side of the car and on the right side of the road in Europe. Like the movie, even the setting has a huge hole in it. Honestly guys, dont even waste your time on this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A fun game, easy to pick up and play and enough content to keep you interested. Regular updates also keep it feeling fresh.. :P
B00005JNEI|3.0|It's clear that Michael Moore often has his own agenda, but I'm sure if he could prove any of the things he says in this film, a lot of people would be in prison. Some things are VERY interesting and really makes you think, while other stuff is complete bull s*** meant to serve his personal agenda, never the less, it was entertaining and it does gives you something to think about.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I enjoyed the authors take on the  new A B C 's of selling. Can't wait to read Drive! Mr. Pink makes reading quick and enjoyable.
B001Q2ZHZE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is based on the theory that for every decision we make, an equal and opposite reaction occurs in another dimension. In this film, Ashton Kutcher's/Logan Lerman's character finds a way to enter these dimensions and make the opposite choice. This movie was so good, because the possibilities are endless. There were two squeals which I haven't seen. Normally I'm all for sequels, but this movie was so good, that I don't wajavascript:performAction(\\"Approve\\")nt to risk tarnishing it by watching the two direct to video squeals, and lets face it, they don't have Ashton in them. In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher shows that he is versatile and can do much more than just romantic comedy. This movie is a Sci-Fi lovers dream and a can't miss film!
1419705849|4.0|I did not read this book. I got this book for my son for christmas. He really liked the book.
B000IZ6URY|3.0|When you see a film by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, you know you're gonna be getting two things. A lot of really stupid moments, that only they get, and moments of pure comic genius. Team America is your typical mix of both. What makes this movie amazing is that they do it all with puppets. Everything from action sequences to sex scenes are all done entirely with puppets. Their songs are hysterical as usual and the characters are great, but unlike most Parker and Stone movies, The story isn't very strong. To be honest, it got really old, really fast, and by the end, I couldn't wait for it to be over. You should see it for its funny moments, but overall it's not their best work.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The movie was very good. My son loved it. The end had a twist that I would have never guessed.
B004UPANAI|5.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine will hopefully be the first in a line of many films explaining the beginnings of the X-men franchise. This film was filled with unbelievable stuns, great action scenes, and tremendous special effect. Like Charles Xavier himself, the writers got right into the mind of the watchers and as soon as the movie started getting predictable and done, they throw you a curve, right at the beginning of an amazing ending. This movie was great!...and for all you lazy, impatient people... make sure you watch the credits all the way to the end.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Its okay. My 9 years old liked it for awhile. Need more educational games offered to children. Maybe add some learning tools into this program.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|You are never too old to make a great action comedy, and Bruce Willis and John Malkovich prove that in RED. This wasn't just another shoot um up kill fest with a story you've seen a million times. RED is action packed, but it's also clever, exciting, and hilarious. It's a fresh movie in a typically repetitive genre. Honestly they don't get much better than this!
B00786XVOG|5.0|Yanni is truly an inspirational person.<br />I love Yanni-Live at Morro Puerto Rico (digipack)& I will be buying more for myself & gifts in the future.<br />Kind Regards<br />June
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Regular readers of this blog know that I don't like super heroes, but Batman is the exception. As a kid he was the only one I thought was cool and the only one that i felt could be real. Apparently Christopher Nolan has the same idea. What I love about his take on Batman is that it's very realistic. Even the joker, as out there as he maybe, was a much more believable and realistic villain than the portrait by Jack Nicholson. As for the movie, it's an amazing story, with one of the best performances ever, by the late Heath Ledger who I really couldn't stand until this movie! As with all Nolan movies, it's a very visually appealing film, with a great story, and cast perfectly. I can honestly say that this is as good as it gets! There will never be a better Batman or super hero movie.
0451169514|5.0|I gave this store and their product five stars because it was beyond what I had expected. The book itself was listed at 'acceptable' condition, but aside from the fact that it had slight shelf wear, it was nearly perfect. I've had books labeled as 'new' and 'perfect condition' that were much more damaged than this one. I was very pleasantly surprised. The order shipped and arrived very quickly and I was excited to get started reading! I will definitely be buying from here again! Thanks!
B000GT6L9Y|3.0|Basically Zathura is the Sci-Fi version of Jumanji. While there are several cameos, the young cast carries the movie and you can sort of see why today names like Josh Hutcherson and Kristen Stewart are household names. The young cast does a great job, especially when you consider that most of the special effects were computer generated, and the majority of acting was done in front of a green screen. Zathura is a sweet game and an interesting movie, with an engaging young cast. It's different from what you would typically see and I enjoyed it quite a bit.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I chose this rating because unlike iTunes, Amazon Instant Video does not require a download time before you can start watching your episode. Also, I've never experienced a lag problem with AIV like I have with iTunes.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Winter's Bone won best film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and was also nominated for 4 Academy Awards including best picture. While it was an outstanding story, it defiantly didn't deserve 3 of the 4 nominations. The film is very dark and slow moving, with lots of unnecessary dramatic pauses. Randomly they jump into country music and shots of hillbillies, it was all very odd. While I really enjoyed this movie, especially the storyline, it gave new meaning to the words \\"white trash\\". The only Oscar nomination that was warranted, is that of Lead Actress, Jennifer Lawrence. I've never seen her in anything before, but god was she impressive. In a world of darkness, drugs, murder, and despair, Ree stood out, everyone who came in contact with her knew she was special and so is the actress who played her. Normally movies like this aren't for me. It was the story that attracted me to this film, but it was Lawrence's performance that made this film worth seeing.
B001F67KOM|5.0|This should be the model by which all other teenage comedies are judged by. This is one of the funniest and coolest movies I have ever seen! It's that old classic tale about the loser kid in school who becomes popular when he stars dating the hot girl who moves in next door...and oh by the way...that girl just happens to be a porn star! Emile Hirsch is amazing in this movie. Not to give anything away, but there is one scene near the end where he's at an awards dinner, he's been looking forward to, that's just classic! Timothy Olyphant is amazing as always, I think he went to the John Malcovich school of how to be the perfect movie villain. I loved this movie and you will too!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|My mother and her boyfriend introduced me to Rodriguez and I was sold upon hearing just a few tracks. I bought the album Cold Fact and have been listening in my car and it feels like a cool summer in 1970s America...but really I'm in snowy New England in February. This will be a new driving and writing companion of mine for sure. Like others have said, its short..so consider buying his second album as well. It's too bad his career didn't take off in the states. We would likely have an excellent catalogue to go through today :/  My favorite tracks are Inner City Blues, Hate Street Dialogue and Establishment Blues.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|Law Abiding Citizen is the ultimate tale of revenge. After his family is killed in a brutal home invasion, Clyde Shelton waits for the legal system to do its job, unfortunately for them, they fail him, and that's when he takes matters into his own hands. This was great, such a unique tale that really blurs the line. It's very hard to decide who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in this one. That's something that makes this film unique. Gerard Butler is amazing as Shelton. Having seen several of Butler's movies previously, I thought he was just your ordinary, so-so, action star until I saw this. He has chops in this movie and can really deliver that one line, similar to Bruce Willis in Die Hard. This movie is fast moving, action packed, and isn't the same old story. Definitely go see this one!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I'm an avid reader, I picked this book for our book club -  Maybe Ms Austin's style and remembrances are just to quiet for my interests, but find myself struggling to be interested to finish this book.
B003IWRE3I|1.0|From the writer of No Country For Old Men, comes yet another tale about the end of the world. From the previews, I thought this movie had promise, that it would be different from other post-apocalyptic stories, but it wasn't. It's the tale of a father and son wondering aimlessly just trying to survive. Nothing is at all explained, there are weird flashbacks, and there are way too many interactions with people. Most of the world is gone, not a single animal survived, yet everywhere you go, you run into people, crazy people, most of whom are cannibals. Viggo Mortensen does give a pretty solid performance, however Kodi Smit-McPhee does not. I've never seen him in anything before, but the whole movie, he's hiding, whining, and screaming papa, it got really annoying! It was awful, I felt like they kept acting out the same scene over and over again in a different location. Nothing happens, there's no plot, and the dialogue is just stupid. This movie is a huge waste of time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is truly a great book! I have never read a book that has made me both laugh and cry within 5 minutes
B002VE5472|3.0|This is not a bad movie, however the big twist wasn't such a surprise. It was actually really good and seemed like something different until the the last 45 minutes or so, then it got a bit more clique. Overall, fairly entertaining and worth the time.
B007SGM084|5.0|The convenience of getting electronically was efficient and very convenient....and good reading!  Process was very easy and cost efficient...will consider for future reading enjoyment.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|The Prestige is vintage Christopher Nolan. A dark, twisted, visually appealing story. I enjoyed this movie a lot, but I must admit, for most of it, I had no idea what was happening. It was a cool story, about two rival magicians trying to discredit one another. While I enjoyed what I was seeing, the story just twisted and turned in ways I couldn't really follow. I know I loved watching it, but afterwards I was still like what the hell? The ending was the most confusing part, not real sure what happened there, maybe one day I'll get it. This film had the star power, one of Hollywood's best directors, and a unique story, but it's going to be hard for a lot of people to follow. I've seen 1000's of films, and it's not often that I get to say, I didn't really get it, especially with something I enjoyed, but I guess Christopher Nolan will do that to ya!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I am using this amp to beef up the computer headphone output power driving some rather nice Bose headphones, especially in the low frequencies. It does this in spades.<br /><br />The reason that I didn't give it the full 5 stars was because the amp is quite noisy when I use it with USB charging cable plugged in. Given the fact that the battery life is pretty good (~5 hours), this isn't too much of an issue unless I'm using it for a full work day. If it does go dead, I can usually let it charge when I'm not using it or just put up with the hiss for a while.
B003204MQS|3.0|I'll be a man and admit it... This movie made me jump quite a few times and left me thinking about it long after it was over. I have been a Horror fan for a long time and that's a very unusual reaction for me. Some people didn't like how it was filmed on camcorders or how it started out slowly, but not me, I thought this was a great movie and new territory for the genre. This is one they'll be talking about for a while.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Being free, this game is most impressive. It's fun but it has some annoying characteristic.<br /><br />1. Being installed on my kindle fire, touch response is a bit less than desirable.<br />2. I don't understand how scoring is accomplished. If I did, I'm sure my game strategy would change.<br />3. In it's original installation, it's free, but soon enough, it starts asking for real money. Play more - pay more.<br /><br />Reading what others have written pretty much covers it.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|I'd actually never seen the first x-men movie. It defiantly filled in the holes I had from the other movies. In general, I am not a fan of superhero movies, they are ridiculous and usually don't have any kind of a decent plot, this movie is different. The story is about fighting discrimination, something many of us can easily relate to...and while the special effects are way over the top, they are most defiantly unique. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine makes the movie and his interplay with cyclops was genius. The second one is still my favorite, but this one was still really good. I highly recommend both it and the rest of the trilogy.
B009ME47H2|4.0|This application does what it claims but has some volume issues. Installed on my kindle fire, it works reasonably well and it's free.
B000J025AE|4.0|Every bit as dramatic and action packed as the original. All it's lacking is the character development the original had, which is more than made up for by the special effects. Very entertaining edge of your seat movie, every bit as good as the original.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I really liked this book, it keeps you guessing who did it throughout. A page-turner that I couldn't get to the end fast enough.  I Highly recommend it!
B001GJ3BPU|1.0|Ben Affleck is a tool. He's about as believable a super hero as I am a super model. Ben, do us all a favor, stick to directing romantic comedies so that I don't have to see you anymore!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Great movie, lots of fun, enjoyed every minute of it,would recommend it to others, best movie I've seen in a while.
B003KRJNBW|2.0|This movie had the right idea, but left far to many unanswered questions. I was expecting a lot more based on the previews and descriptions, but I was left with a film that was not unique. Denzel Washington was amazing as usual, but sadly, overall, The Book of Eli wasn't anything special. Just another tale about the world will end one day and reveal what savage beasts we truly are.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I felt the book moved slower than necessary, but the subject is so enlightening.  This book gave me a totally differect perspective on death..............and life!!!!!!  I feel this is a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone afflicted with a disease or knows someone who is dealing with such.  In my opinion, this book is not just about disease but also &#34;dis-ease&#34; of any kind.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|First time Writer/Director George Nolfi made an excellent choice in picking this old Phillip K. Dick story to adapt for the big screen. With a Dick story, you know to expect certain things. A love story, some really cool special effects, and an ending that can lead you anywhere. The Adjustment Bureau doesn't disappoint, following the Dick model to the letter,  the story is solid, unique, and imaginative. The lead, Matt Damon, gives you exactly what you'd expect out of him. Emily Blunt along side, gives an equally strong performance. The one knock on the film has to be its single mindedness. The objective never changes and the Congressman's love for Elise, a woman he hardly knows, is borderline obsessive. It is a little slow and narrow minded, but overall it's a great story and far from predictable.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Movie was excellent. Enjoyed the storyline. Was sure that this picture would win the OSCAR. Enjoyed watching it over AMAZON PRime streaming service.
B004FEFZU2|5.0|Sometimes in order to make something fresh and exciting again, you have to go back to the beginning, and that's exactly what Saw did. While I enjoyed all the movies, this one has less flashbacks, and is as creepy than ever before. If you are not on the edge of your seat for this one, there is something wrong with you! The final chapter as they claim it to be, might have been the best Saw film yet and the way they chose to end it will just blow your mind all over again. Even if you gave up after the first two or three, SEE THIS MOVIE!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was absolutely wonderful!!!! I am eager to get the next book to see what happens when Madness finally does let go!!!
B004OBQDHK|4.0|The ultimate \\"dude\\" movie!!! It's you're typical strange early 90's movie, but what a lot of people who don't give it a chance don't realize is, it's a great movie! Parts of it were a little predictable, but that's over shadowed by it's amazing chase and fight scenes, not to mention a great storyline. Keanu Reeves really was much better than people gave him credit for earlier on in his career.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have a Job that unfortunately makes me wait; be it planes, meetings or sitting outside some jokers office, this app makes waiting almost worth it
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|This movie has a great cast, a seemingly good story, and a ton of eye candy, but even with all that it has going for it. It was just weird. I didn't understand the code, the slang, or the point. I was looking forward to this one and I was incredibly disappointing. This is just one strange movie that you can avoid.
0345803485|5.0|The price for the product was fantastic.  I bought all three books and enjoyed everyone of them.  I am currently reading them for the second time.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I no way endorse ANYTHING Angelina Jolie is in, however wanted is impossible, ridiculous, and one hell of a ride! We don't watch movies to experience the predictable or only what's possible. Wanted is exciting, well written, full of twists, and well worth the price of admission.
B009JBZH54|2.0|I  purchased this for my father's birthday. By the time he tried watching the third disc, the return window had closed. The disc does not play at all and he's now stuck with a non-working end to an awesome trilogy.
B002N14GPE|4.0|I was a bit hesitant to see this movie, because to me, the story seemed unbelievable. How evil could a 10 year old girl be, right? ...wrong! Esther is one crazy little...! I really didn't think I'd like this movie, but I loved it. Isabelle Fuhrman is amazing in this film. If the performance wasn't in the context of a messed up girl in a horror movie, she would have gotten academy notice, she was THAT good. Jimmy Bennett was also really good playing her adoptive brother, he even did his own stunts. Every time I see this kid he gets better and better, and I think you'll be seeing his name in films for the next fifty years. The parents don't really have a major role in the film, but they were equally as good. The cast was great, the lead was amazing, the story was solid, and there is a hell of a twist at the end, that in and of itself makes this film worth watching.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter was thrilled with the latest book and has enjoyed reading it. Now she is ready for the movie to come out!!
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|From the Funky Bunch to action movie star, it's been a long road for Mark Wahlberg. A long road filled with a lot of bad movies, but in recent years he has finally mastered his craft and Shooter is the crown jewel. This is the perfect action movie! A GREAT story, several plot twists, and lots of explosions. Wahlberg was the perfect choice to play Swagger and really brings to life the best intended parts of his character. This is an absolute can't miss movie for action fans. I was truly in awe!
B0068FYZIO|4.0|The movie is a classic for many people. The packaging looks pretty darn good, and the price very affordable. If anyone decides to own this movie, this is not a bad purchase. Kind of a heavy film, and not one you would watch more than once every two years, come to think of it. The subject matter is not very pleasant, let's just leave it at that. The quality of the movie when played in a decent machine is very nice, it looks like it might have been remastered for the 100th Anniversary. 4 Stars.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Limitless is one of these rare films, where the preview doesn't give you a clue as to how good it really is. I saw this because the movie I wanted to see wasn't playing until 11, and I honestly didn't expect much from it. What I got was a visual masterpiece, with some of the best camera work I've ever seen, and an amazing story that was so much more than some guy and his magic pill. It's intense, shocking, and unique. Bradley Cooper really makes the movie. He FINALLY lets go of his super cool, good looking guy image, and really shows the audience that he can act! This movie was a breath of fresh air and I can't wait til it comes out on DVD so I can see it again!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game controls really well and is a really good mario clone. controls immeasurably better than emulators on my phone and tablet. and since its free I would recommend this to any platforming fan. heck its easily worth a buck or two... but I am cheap lol.
B007HOD2WA|4.0|In Hostel, two American college students go traveling across Europe. On the train they hear about a hostel in Slovakia that attracts lots of girls, so naturally they head there. Unbeknownst to them, the hostel is run by a group who mercenaries who kidnap tourists and sell them to rich people to torture for kicks. While the situation is a nightmare, the story really isn't that scary. It's bloody and very gory, but it's not going to keep you up at night. It was a good movie, I like blood and guts, but that's not how it was advertised! This was advertised as being one of the scariest movies ever and it just wasn't. If you're a horror fan, it's defiantly worth seeing, but be warned, it's more about shock and awe than it is scary.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It was almost a quarter into the book before it really caught my interest and started to pick up speed.  Do like the character and this author's writing, but this one left me a tad flat.  Probably the ending prompted a less than stellar review.  Too many unanswered, dead drops and loose ends ( not the type that leads to the next novel).
B001CDD84Y|5.0|Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson. What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't already been said? The man is a legend. This film is interesting, unique, fast-paced, and even funny. I loved every minute of Jumper and if Sci-Fi is your thing, you will too!
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|So Cool!
B0030B0S2Q|2.0|Sam Rockwell gives an Oscar worthy performance in an otherwise dark and mediocre film. I can see what the director was aiming for, but he missed the mark big time. The story was decent enough, but the movie was very slow and extremely predictable. The performance of Rockwell, was his best performance to date, however it was wasted on what i thought was a pretty dull movie.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I'm pretty sad I have been playing for about a month or so and I'm at level 46. I have no friends since the new update and no way to get hearts for ponies. I have just one last quest to do but it in evolving hearts... :( they need new quest and change hearts into coins when buying ponies in the shop.
B0032SQCQI|4.0|Wonderfully weird and imaginative. This is a sci-fi cult classic that fell under the radar, but it is a really great film. I heard a lot of people bash this thing, but this movie is about much more than a box and a button. If you're not a sci-fi fan and not used to this type of film, it might be a bit confusing, but stay with it. I think it's well worth it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far I love it. Much better than the other horse games out there. I can't wait to see where it goes. Graphics are not the best. That's why I gave it a four.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|I don't like Ben Affleck as an actor. I think he's very overrated and quite bland. As a director thou, he is now 2 for 2. The town was a terrific story based on actually events. The action sequences are phenomenal and the story was pretty solid. The crappy bawston accents did make the dialogue a little difficult to understand but overall, I feel like this was a great film that defiantly lives up to the hype. It worth checking out.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I chose Smith PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction because of the light weight so I could carry in anywhere. With what could be an incorrect technique, it worked 'okay' on one knife of stainless steel, but not the Gerber knife I chose, which was 'not' sharp out of the box. I tried desperately to get an edge on that knife, with the larger Smith's Diamond as well. However, due to it's weight, it would not be practical for me to carry it in my backpack. This is why I made every attempt to use the smaller version, but to no avail. As I stated, it worked for the stainless steel, but not the high carbon blade of the Gerber knife. I'm disappointed that I must now take it to a professional for sharpening. But, the diamond stick on this Pocket Pal did a great job on my kitchen serrated knife, and I was truly impressed in that regard. For what it is, it's very good, but not the best. I do recommend it, but not for high carbon steel that is not sharp out of the box. Do not expect to get an edge on that knife with this tool. Have it sharpened professionally first, as the Smith's PP1 is great for 'finishing.'
B002TZS5GU|3.0|Carriers is a surreal look at the end of humanity through the eyes of 4 survivors of a deadly virus. Unlike many other similar stories, Carriers follows two brothers and shows just how far people would really have to go in order to survive something of this nature. Its raw and graphic and made me wonder if this is how the people who lived through the plague felt.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Husband bought this a day ago and I haven't been able to put it down!  I have a 8 yr old and 2 yr old who love it just as much as I do.  Great game!
B002GHHHP6|3.0|I hate westerns and that's why I'd actually never seen this Richard Donner directed, western about a con man before. To be honest, it had everything you'd expect to see in a Richard Donner film, including a terrific cameo by Danny Glover. It was a little predictable at times, but the ending was classic. I also loved the scenery and costume design. Overall it was a pretty good movie. If I had one desire, it would be that the movie was a little more edgy, but other than that it was a great film. Mel Gibson was very likable, shame that's only the case on the big screen huh?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I didn't see the HBO series.  It takes a while to get the characters straight, but well worth it. Many twists and turns... Can't wait to start the next book.
B000JCSBU0|2.0|Weird, confusing, and pointless. I really don't understand what all the hype is about. Yes, Ellen Burstyn performance was unbelievable, but the movie was just terrible. Honestly, I know it has a huge cult following, but wtf is so special about it? Please someone fill me in...What am I missing?
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The Preston/Child team have done it again with a truly outstanding conclusion to this wonderful trilogy.  Pendergast has been revealed to have human frailties but still manages to amaze at every turn!  Two thumbs way up!
B004JVZXXU|3.0|I don't have much to say about this one. It wasn't bad, A little more hokier than the first, definatly not as scary, but still pretty entertaining for what it was.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone...the colors in the pixs are so vivid...cute storyline...My 9 year old son loved it.
6305212112|5.0|This movie shows the audience the true meaning of friendship. Set in modern times, with flashbacks to the early 1900's, Fried Green Tomatoes shows the story of two unlikely friendships...and this film has it all! Drama, Comedy, Tragedy, Murder, Slavery, Lesbianism, you name it, this film has it. It's a classic and one of my favorite 90s films. All the ladies are terrific and the story is magical. Movies like this are the reason people go to the movies. There are a million reasons to see this film, it's one you'll be talking about!
B002VRZEYM|3.0|After reading the reviews for this movie, I decided to give it a go. Eyes closed, I sat down for the complete 94 minutes that the movie lasted only to be left disappointed- my eyes did not open. Perhaps it was a server-side issue, but whatever the case, be aware of faulty reviews.<br /><br />It sounded pretty good, however. Lots of good info
B002ZG9846|3.0|It wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be a fun mix of comedy and action, but it wasn't. It started out pretty good, but then it just went way over the top, filled with clique violence and often used catch phrases. It was predictable, all be it entertaining. If you were like me however, expecting anything more than just another shoot 'em up, blow 'em up, action film, you're gonna be disappointed.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|This is a good movie to see if you want to understand the whole trilogy, but I wouldn't see it's mandatory. Dark Knight is the best of the three in my (and most people's) opinion. If you only have 3 hours to burn, just watch Dark Knight- you don't really NEED to know anything in this film, although it may clear up little details for you. If you have time to watch the whole series, I do recommend you watch this but I will say it is the least action packed of the three.
B00003CXXP|2.0|A.I. is quite possibly the strangest and most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The special effects and the teddy bear were cool as hell, but the whole story was just freaking creepy.
0767903862|4.0|Good book to read if you're going to head to Australia. And that's coming from someone who had to read it for school! Good humor, good facts, very informative and not too long. I would say a lot of it is quite accurate too, having traveled to Australia as part of a study abroad program through Michigan State University.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|This movie has a terrific cast! Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors and I was really looking forward to this, but I quickly saw why all the big companies past on it and why it went direct to video. The story was bland, rushed, and predictable.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I had some serious doubts that this product wouldn't make me happy, as I can be quite the audiophile, however I am more than pleased with the performance of this product.<br /><br />It does exactly what it designed to do: take in digital audio via coax or TOSlink, and spit it out analog via stereo RCA connectors.  I am using the TOSlink input and it works FLAWLESSLY!<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|People bashed it cause it was a big budget film and the focus of the previews and reviews were on the special effects, however this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, filled with hidden messages and real implications for our future. If you refuse to see it because it was a highly publicized blockbuster, than you are an idiot!
B006MW3UZW|1.0|No closed caption option.  For a deaf consumer like me. I can't even return the order. It is not fair.
B000UJ48VI|5.0|I read this novel about 35 years ago and was keen to see this movie all the times ever since
B005USZML4|5.0|I grew up reading Grisham's books. I almost took law because of him. Now I wish I was Theo Boone when I was young. I totally love his character. This is a must-read and I would say it suits all ages. Two thumbs up! Nice and interesting plot and turn of events. I can't wait to continue the series.
B00004XPPC|5.0|this is one of greatest movie directed by director David Leans, excellent music and photography, worth watching any number of times
0394400267|5.0|The book  was just as  advertised.  I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  I bought it for my son, and he was thrilled with it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game.  hate the hours hase also long to cook food but always s some thing to look forward to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought it was a very great love/adventure story!!<br />Hunger games is so amazingly great!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This little tripod works great.  Well, once I fixed it. The metal rod came out of the ball that swivels to angle the phone how you want first time I used it.  But, I put super glue in hole, pushed rod back in and been perfect every since.
B0067R0APK|3.0|The app work fine but, Icon on Kindle is not approriate. Can it be changed. Other than that I might use it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I saw the Hunger Games movie, I dedided that I had to read the entire series.  I love it.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|\\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is about a man who will not give up his values for anything.  There's a scene where one of the inmates is shaking his head and saying, \\"I don't have any chains\\" while Newman is saddled with chains for trying to escape.  But really he does have chains and Newman is the one who is free- because he's free in the mind (he hasn't given up his values).<br /><br />Everybody in the movie tries to break him and he never gives up.<br /><br />This is my favorite movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is well written and truly holds your interest.  I recommend the Hunger Games series as a definitel must read.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love this CD! Ordered it for a friend for her birthday and it came so quickly. The CD was in perfect shape and was exactly what I wanted.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I saw the Hunger Games movie, I dedided that I had to read the entire series.  I love it.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|LIKE I SAID BEFORE, CANT WAIT FOR MY ORDER TO GET HERE, i SIMPLY LOVE THE ENTIRE SAGA. JUST WISH THERE WAS MORE TO COME.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not my most fab but very good. A quick read for me. The ending was very predictable. I liked it.
B0045XICB2|5.0|ALL THE MOVIES ARE AWESOME!!! SO ARE THE BOOKS. i FOUND THAT READING THE BOOKS AFTER SEEING THE MOVIES WAS MUCH BETTER, BECAUSE THE BOOKS GAVE MORE DETAIL AND I COULD REPLAY THE MOVIE IN MY HEAD WHILE READING THE BOOK/
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Pretty good movie puts u on edge throughout the whole movie with a decent ending which is rare in horror movies nowadays
140131046X|5.0|If you like Mitch Albom, this is another must read.  Albom's books are always well-written and make for an enjoyable read.  This book didn't disappoint.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|My pics are upside down no matter how I turn my kindle fire... how am I suppose to take pictures this way?
B005LN5UOC|5.0|Inexpensive compared to the much pricier bluetooth headsets that are out there.  Does the job as advertised.  I would recommend to anyone not wanting to overspend for a bluetooth headset for kids.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is Amazing and I would recommend this game for everyone of all ages! i play it first thing in the morning, daytime and before I go to bed as I cannot set it down for very long. The dragons and islands are fascinating and never a boring moment.
B004SIP71M|4.0|Had not seen this before.  MARVELOUS acting by Streep (although I do NOT like her in this \\"mother of a dog\\" role), and the Priest.  Good story line, but when all is said and done, there is no proof!  I Resent ANYONE who assumes actions without proof, no matter who they are.  Good movie.  I recommend, but again, I did not like Streep in this kind of a role.<br />Cecy Ivie
B0050R0XEG|4.0|Anything with a VOLKSWAGEN in it combined with the LEGO builder is awsome. besides there is something magical when you put a &#34;proyect together&#34; with the help of your kids like this set.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This a great book.....it follows the other two great....the ending could have been a little different, but that is okay
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|My husband is a pilot and found some of the airplane details unbelievable. Denzel Washington was great and it was an interesting story. It was awfully hard to watch the main character self-destructing. Still trying to figure out if the booze in the mini-bar next door was a &#34;coincidence&#34;  or a set-up.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have loved this musical for years and this production does not disappoint. The music, cast and story is entrancing. Excellent in every way. See something new with each viewing. Spellbinding! Wow!
6300183513|5.0|Ordered this for my sister for a gift.  She was thrilled.  she has always loved this movie.  I will be ordering more in the future for her.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I live in an oil producing state. They want to do this NEXT DOOR to my house. After seeing this movie<br />I became an activist. Thankfully, a year later, we've run them out of town.<br />Very important movie.  Save your water, your home, your life, your health, your pets, your kids, everything.<br /><br />Not to be missed.
B000GV8OY2|5.0|Being from the St. Louis area we love it of course and such quick service.  My sister is really enjoying this film.
B003PGNBNY|3.0|CAMP ROCK IS A FUN MOVIE WITH SINGING AND DANCING OR HOW TO FIGHT TO SAVE YOUR CAMP TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED NO MATTER IF FANCY OR NOT. WHO EVER IS INTO MUSICALS AND DANCE THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG CROWD.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this is my 4 year old granddaughter's favorite of the games on my Kindle.  She can play it for<br />an hour non stop.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Like many Kindlers, I have been way too lax in expending the effort to write reviews of books I've read. I'm taking a few days off my own writing to go back and review some of the books I've enjoyed over the years. \\"The Woman in White\\" is definitely high on my list.<br /><br />Now why write a review about a book written in 1860? It certainly doesn't help the author sell more copies. Ah! But it might help draw the attention of readers to a wonderful author. And Wilkie Collins is, in my opinion, one of the best mystery novelists of all time.<br /><br />First off, this book is generally considered to be one of the first in the genre of mystery novels. Many feel that Collins virtually invented the detective novel as we know it.<br /><br />The main character, Walter Hartright, is an art teacher who helps a woman in distress - the woman in white. He is hired as a teacher for the Fairlie family and falls head over heels in love with their niece, Laura. Of course, he is the total gentleman and the epitome of discretion.<br /><br />There are plots and subplots and intrigue and relationships that build upon one another. We have asylums, estates, legal documents, lost relatives, inheritance and even a \\"secret society\\". All the makings for a terrific mystery.<br /><br />Now this has to be taken within the context of life in England at that time. Falling in love does not involve hopping into bed for sweaty sex - at least not for the honorable Walter. He is protective of Laura and looks after her interests.<br /><br />I write poetry and short stories and love crime detective mystery novels. I am beginning to dabble in short stories in this realm and find that the novels by Wilkie Collins are magnificent training.<br /><br />If you do enjoy this novel, be sure to also read \\"The Moonstone\\".  This one was the groundbreakers for the detective genre. The two of them are Collins' finest books.
1451627297|5.0|I generally shy away from used books but the price was so great I could not pass it up. I was not disappointed. Book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Their music is simply beautiful. I can listen to it for hours and hours. Cant wait for their new album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing. It always kept me on edge and wanting more. I have always loved this book series and this is my favorite one.
0756655730|5.0|Includes all prehistoric lives until early humans. Good pictures and illustrations, brief but complete, it is a good quick read.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I read and this helped me although I probably could have managed without it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book because, it's funny, dramatic, just great u reading this review should not read this but read the book.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|This is a very entertaining show. Con games are fun to watch, and con men are usually charming, that's how they manage to fool people. But some of us feel uncomfortable cheering for the con men, so in this show the twist is that the con man is recruited by the FBI and is using his skills to assist the law, so we are free to enjoy his tricks.<br /><br />I have to add that Matt Bomer, the handsome gay actor who plays Neal the con man,  is not convincing as a flirtatious straight man. He doesn't seem to have any chemistry with the women he was involved with, flirts with or tries to con. I have seen gay actors play straight men with much more conviction than he does.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but I saw the movie and thought I would give it a go. It was nothing like the movie. It was so much better. I would recommend this book to anyone who like mythology.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|It's truly a great album. I am very pleased with the products and I've listened to the album in the car/laptop/Blue-Ray DVD and it all sounds great.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|Love the action and the storyline. Sometimes &#34;flicks&#34; like this get carried away with the &#34;love and hate relationships of the characters,&#34;....But Matt was all business. Thanks Again
B0079R8KXG|5.0|It's just what I expected.  Fits well and the material is nice.  It doesn't look or feel cheap.  Disagree with the negative reviews.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|This is a song that's really easy to get into, with a great melody and Mariah singing like she used to back in the day.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is definitely worth the money. Nice graphics, interesting storyline. Part hog and puzzles that were challenging but not frustrating. Can't wait for the second part.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I love love love this movie. I watch it again and again. It showed up right on time and in great shape.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love minecraft! its so addicting! its just, id rather there be villages, wolves, ect. now im bein bored writing the rest of this review....... poopy doopy doo!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|With two wildly gripping yet commercially underperforming movies under his belt (Gone Baby Gone and The Town), Ben Affleck finally gets his breakout hit with &#34;Argo&#34;, a smart and tense thriller that boasts a terrific cast and intensely engaging story.<br /><br />First of all, the cast here is amazing. Say what you want about Affleck's &#34;Gigli&#34; days but the actor continues to prove he has what it takes to pull off a challenging role. Affleck's Mendez is meticulous and intelligent yet comfortable in not being recognized for the true hero that he was. The actor/director surrounds himself with great talent as well, such as the men who helped make his plan possible including Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and Bryan Cranston.<br /><br />The direction is this film is so good and once and for all proves that, though I enjoy his roles, Affleck is a much better director than actor. The story never waivers or lingers longer than it should and the introductory scene, as well as the white-knuckle finale are some of the most tense moments in recent movie history. The film also contains a lot of comedic moments, mainly as it pokes fun of the movie industry it's portraying. There's a real dark comedy feel to the film and Arkin and Goodman especially have some great lines.<br /><br />While I can't vouch for the validity of the historical accuracy behind the story, the film presented is engaging, political, and hard to forget. The movie is more than deserving of the plethora of awards it received and the hype it's obtained. Any pundits who claimed Affleck didn't have the chops to make it as a director in Hollywood can finally be silenced. With one of the best movies of the year and the Academy Award for Best Picture in his hand, Mr. Affleck will be able to make any movie he chooses from this point forward, and that is something to look forward to.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Lots of action! The plot was really good as well! Love Tom Cruise!! I think this one was the best one yet!
B00979CS50|2.0|I love Neil Young, and I may just be getting old, but this Psychedelic Pill was a bit hard to swallow.  Very extended jams, but where's the song?  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It cost the same to buy the 8 disc set as to but the last 2 movies. No major extras but I neved watch those anyway.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Based on a true story! The actual real characters are in the movie/cameo. Christian Bale really, really did a great job! Came on time, we thank you Amazon!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Kay Scarpetta is very familiar to me. Cornwell has stayed true to her character-building with each of her stories. Always leaves me wanting more.
1452110581|5.0|Really funny stuff, I bought one for myself and several as gifts for people who love (or have mixed feelings about) their cats.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Shooting with the Nikon D7000, and I've found the SB-700 to be an excellent companion to that setup. This is the best all-around choice for most people shooting a  D7000 series DSLR from Nikon.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is a great game to play in your spare time.I enjoy playing it wherever I am.some levels are hard though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book. Recently lost my copy, so had to purchase electronically. A science-fiction novel for anyone. I do hope they don't slaughter it when making the movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great collection, one sure to be viable over the years and generations who review it.  One of the best motion pictures on World War II created showing combat from the soldiers perspective.  Ranks right up there with the German developed &#34;Das Boot&#34; as far as verisaiilitude is concerned.  From what I understand, after 28 years of military service, a difficult subject well presented.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game works as intended. Very addicting to say the least; the fact that there's no need to buy anything makes it very accesible to everyone. Also the ads were not intrusive and did not detract from play.
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|This is a really good instrumental record. It reminds me somewhat of Jeff Beck's Blow By Blow album with a little more funk inserted into it. Very tight group and lots of cool sounds and grooves. There is a hidden song at the end of the last song that shows up at the 10 minute mark on the track after 4 minutes of silence, FYI.
B007PVHANM|5.0|One of the better documentaries I have seen. Came away much more informed about Marley personally and his philosophy on life.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is amazing! Very comfortable to wear with plenty of room to pack camera, lenses and even binoculars. I packed 3 lenses, camera, cell phone, point and shoot, binoculars, book, and a small bottle of water.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|really fun and very challenging at times. I wish there were more hints. other than that really great free game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good product. It is as described on Amazon. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Excellent book, lots of new info!  GErts into issues and personalities like few if any other books on the Presidency.  --JDS
B0086700CM|5.0|This product is as described on Amazon. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can only access the latest 6 news feed entries at any one time. I don't actually bother using it on the Kindle now. My Android version is much more convenient.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good product. It is as described on Amazon. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition. The Ads are a pain though.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Bought this case for me and my sister. My sisters broke within the first week she had it and mine worked crappy I couldn't hear anyone I was constantly pushing buttons during a call and no one could hear me and it sounded like if I put my music up a little bit it was gonna bust my speakers!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Product was as described on Amazon. It served the purpose. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Nobody admires an alcoholic.  Nobody admires a group of recovering addicts that, likely, will not succeed in seeing recovery.  But you will admire this movie.  It cleverly represents the variety of people caught up in addiction, and the casting agent deserves praise for finding gems for each role.  It shows the pitfalls in recovery, and for the first time in my life, I understood what strength it takes to overcome addiction.  I also understood some of the things that drive people to substance abuse.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, edited and staged, you will find humor where none should exist, and you, like me, will buy a replacement copy when one of your rotten kids loans it out to a friend who never returns it.
159420411X|5.0|Must reading for anyone studying or using statistics, especially for predictive purposes. Many examples of misuse or ignorance of data, and how each should have been handled.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't see what the big deal is with this game.  I refused to pay the 6-7 dollars for it, but my son wanted it so he gave me his money so I could download it on the kindle.  I think the graphics are boxy and strange but he loves it and spends time building stuff.  He showed me a couple of vampires he had to fight.  Honestly, I have no idea what was happening in the game.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|the app wont let me use it. its on my kindle, but it says its not an installed app please help!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan does it again. As the the excellent writer he already is he manages again to make a fabulous book. Good job rick
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I enjoy the retro feel to this album. I heard her singing \\"Mercy\\" a couple times while shopping at the Supermarket and went on a quest to find out who this artist was, Aretha Franklin with a cold?, one of the Supremes? I sang the words I could remember to as many people as I could, young and old, but no one knew who it was. I found her on the net and bought my first pop music in years. Poor little gal just wants to be loved by someone who will be faithful...simple, timeless.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Better than the last DeMille novel I read which I thought was great.  (The Generals Daughter).  Funny,witty, and action filled prose.  The Panther was an amazing book.  Now my biggest problem is what book shall I read next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a surprise ending! I was shocked with the story but loved every single chapter. How original this story line was and it was very juicy and sensual as well!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this suspenseful novel. One word of caution this is not an uplifting story with a lot of character growth. It is dark and it's characters do not have many redeeming values. i liked the format of the book and was surprised at several points. I was sure I had it figured out, then boom.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|HIghly recommended. An uplifting book that is refreshing original. The title accurately describes what the book is about but does not hint at the wonderful character development/interaction it contains.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This movie is funny and suspenseful. the acting is superb. This is a don't miss movie. Maggie Smith as always is the best.
2218951983|5.0|As I wrote in another review of the Verb book by Bescherelle, this line of books is incredibly organized and full of information. Whether you are a beginner or experienced, you will gain a lot from what this book offers. Everything is 100% in French, and is organized into several helpful categories and sub categories. You can't go wrong.
B009TSA7MA|5.0|If you love good old rock MSG,Scorpions,UFO you will not be dissapointed.video seems to jump around a bit but overall a great concert.
B000FC13MM|5.0|When I first started reading this, I had a very hard time staying involved and connected with the characters and the story line. Mostly it was  my fault because I am not really a fan of necromancy and I immediately wrote this book off.<br /><br />My wife, who is always into reading new books outside of her comfort zone, told me  to give it a chance, to release my preconceived notions I had and to just read the book for what it was.<br /><br />Doing so I found that I could not put the book down. Reading Sabriel was like trying to eat one cookie when you have been starving for weeks! I could not put the book down!<br /><br />Whatever you are reading, give it a chance. It may turn out to be the best ride of your life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is the same game we all grew up with on our computers.  takes me back everytime I play no issues so far and willow keep on playing
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is entertaining and challenging at the same time. The longer the train gets the harder it gets. I can play for hours , love the sound effects and different coasters. Keep it coming . Excellent Game.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|for the sound/audiophile enthusiast this is a great product. Easy to operate and it lasts a long time on a single charge!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun long term game,  but it does not always start right away,  if at all on my kindle.  the loading screen never goes away and I have to restart my kindle or play something else.
B0053O89XI|5.0|best comedy on tv! if you have missed all the other episodes/seasons now would be a great time to start buying and watching!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|This app.will not update and will not open.  This app.used to be great.  You could listen to past shows as well as listen to podcadts and live radio.  They need to fix this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game get it now at Amazon it's so fun going on turns nd on trans just get the game trust me!!<br />_
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Now &#34;Argo&#34; is a very  great film but this film is 10x better.  Where &#34;Argo &#34; glamorized and &#34;beefed up&#34; the story &#34;Zero Dark 30&#34; stays true and the results is a  much better and powerful  story that leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusion.<br /><br />If you missed this at the theaters then makes this a must see.  I don't think children would want to see this but if they do watch it with them.  Not recommended for anyone under 12.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked this book. Very similar to fifty shades as far as the characters go. Got sick of Eva testing the limits though. Foolish girl.
0786962984|4.0|As a former casual D&D player in my youth, I was looking forward to finally playing a game with my kids I would enjoy. You can only play candy land, pop the pig, and Mouse trap so many times. After reading the reviews, I was pretty sure this game would be a good choice for my 7 and 5 year old children. As kids that love games/Lord of the rings/ and Lego, I figured this would be right up their alley. Other than one crying fit over a &#34;stupid orc that wont die&#34;, it has been a very positive experience!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy enough for a 5 year old with basic math skills<br />Fueled by imagination, not batteries<br />Just complicated enough to be fun<br />Excellent artwork!<br />Cons:<br />Little cardboard figures aren't going to last long. Also the cards are printed on thin cardboard.<br />Not many really- good game for the price!<br /><br />I highly recommend for parents who want a simple and fun role playing game to play with your kids. I would give 5 stars, but the little cardboard characters and pieces are going to have to be watched closely in our home. Probably going to upgrade to some little mini figurines in the near future.
B008Y6SGC6|5.0|I have always liked Sandra Bullock.  This is not one of her better movies - but it is worth watching how she transitions from a junkie to a great person.
140123769X|5.0|After the disappointment of &#34;wolves of the heartland&#34;this was a wonderful read. As usual, gut wrenching with a lot of adventure thrown in. Don't want to give anything away, but anyone who has enjoyed Fables so far will love it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is addicting.  I have it on a little game that I bought years ago.  I love playing it, and playing it, and playing it.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I was so excited to get this in the mail, and to my expectancy it came in good packaging and NOT ruined whatsoever.<br />It plays perfectly, and would recommend buying 100%.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Wished I hadn't as I found out I don't really need it.  It's great of course on my desktop computer.  But a total waste on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was fun. I think it should tell you that it's only a sample though. I wasn't expecting to have to pay for the rest of the game.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I love this movie it came in perfect condition and was cheap.  It was a great present for my dad.  (He loves this movie).
B004JY0KP8|2.0|This is a fine, accurate, dependable Seiko quartz watch, but its design left some things to be desired, and I returned it.<br /><br />From a distance it looks elegant.  Close up, not so much, because the numbers and so forth look like they're printed on the dial, not engraved, or whatever the process is on more expensive watches.<br /><br />More important, and the thing that killed the watch for me, the hands are the same color as the dial, so you have to peer at it for a while to figure out what time it is. The dial is complex, as chronographs normally are, and the colors are poorly chosen, so it's hard to read the time quickly. The only hand that is a contrasting color is the chronograph second hand, which normally doesn't move and just distracts your eye.<br /><br />Overall a fail for me.  There are other chronographs, including ones from Seiko, that are designed better.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie, great price.  The best batman.  It came in great condition and worked perfectly.  I just wish it came with a dvd copy to so I can watch it on my Xbox.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have enjoyed all the of Preston and Child books and this one is no exception. Can't wait for the next adventure.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Couldn't stand any character I saw in that time.  Dopers, smokers, sluts.  Not my kinda people.  The movie is in the toilet and it looks like Denzel's once bright career is also.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3, two bad we have to wait so long for season # 4 to start. And I'm not happy that Matthew died !! Giant bummer.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Have read several of his books, but this one was too drawn out.  I would not recommend this book at all.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have Yahoo mail on my computer for several years. They filter my messages, I have never<br />received spam in my inbox. I recently added yahoo mail to my  Kindle.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! I had a difficult time putting it down. The end did leave me wanting more, so maybe there will be a second book.
0374275637|3.0|great addition to my library. glad i purchased it. worth the read. looking forward to other additions. love to collect.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have my own business and this app is really easy to use.  I wish I could change the headliner color for different types of apts. But besides that I love it
B000W93CHC|5.0|World Without End by Ken Follett is refreshing and elegantly written book that follows the life of several characters as they try to change Kingbridge, some for the better, and some for the worse. In a constant uphill battle, Merthin and Caris battle on behalf of the town against Godywn and Philmon who egocentric, and power hungry monks. At the same time, the plague hits Kingsbridge and nearly wipes out the town. Merthin, Caris and some of the town's people must struggle to stay alive and keep the town prosperous. This is a great book that I would recommend.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Such a great plot and the acting is pretty darn good also. It's like the Soprano's but with some redneck and white trash mixed in.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My 3 yr old daughter loves watching this movie and I've enjoyed it too. I don't think you will be disappointed.

0375851569|5.0|Always a favorite of all our young nieces and nephews!  We are going to get the second set when our grandniece turns 1 year old!
B007THA4FI|4.0|The Casual Vacancy can come across as rather depressing. J.K. Rowlings is rather like Harold Pinter in her ability to reproduce the language of the British--the small town elitists, the public housing's outcasts, and especially the youth. She manages to skewer them all.<br />The sudden death of one of the small rural town's council members, encourages others to propose themselves as replacements. In doing so they slowly reveal their unsuitability for the post, their bigotries, their shady sides, and their dysfunctional families.<br />If you enjoy English TV shows, like Midsomer Murders, then you've seen the settings, the landscapes, and the meanness of the characters. All the worst of British social class interactions appear in the book. The author weaves a story around all her characters and the reader gets swept into the intrigues, the slums, the careless teenage sex, and the downward spiral to disaster.<br />This was the perfect read for a trip--it was foreign enough to be fun, and familiar enough to keep me involved. While the setting is distinctly English, you'll recognize people and attitudes from your home town.<br />An interesting, if not uplifting read. Don't read this if you are running for public office: you might just see yourself.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book literally had me at the edge of my sea with HEART racing moments..<br /> Perfect love story wit a surprise ending..
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I attempted to load this several times & received an error message saying that I had to do it through the Amazon Ap Store, but that's where I was attempting to get it from! I love this ap. I have it on my android phone (paid for it), on my android tablet (Allowed me to use the version I paid for without charging me twice), & I'd like to have it on my Kindle Fire. Can you please fix this?
0689835604|5.0|My little boy LOVES reading this book! He's only  9 months old and already points to my belly button and his! Very cute with the pictures and flaps.  The book is also simple enough for easy learning for the little ones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Simple, fun, and educational<br />* Bright colors<br />*The board book allows for teething babies to read too<br />*Great Value<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The flaps are easy to rip off. .  especially with older babies who want to gap and pull everything.
1611748755|5.0|This kept my attention throughout. I recommend this to all adults.  I  look forward to other books by this author.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|Very fast shipping. Baby loved it for a while. Think it did get old after a while. But definitely kept him occupied for a bit.
0374214913|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />This was surprisingly awesome.<br /><br />Robin Sloan's debut novel, Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore blew me away.<br /><br />Imagine working in a bookstore (which I often do), late at night (which would be mysteriously spooky, but also fittingly romantic), for an enigmatic old man named Mr. Penumbra (who gives the impression that he may, in fact, be a wizard). Imagine that this shop only contains a few of the \\"normal\\" titles from bestseller lists and classics, but it has three stories of bookshelves crammed with old, obscure titles that are never sold. Instead, they are checked out by an eclectic bunch of patrons who seem to crave each successive more than the last. Upon receiving the job, your boss, the quirky old Penumbra, tells you there are only three policies for working in the store: 1) you must be on time for work and never leave early; 2) you must keep a detailed account of each customer, what they purchased, their appearance, mannerisms, and demeanor; and 3) you must never look inside the books. What would you do? Of course, you look.<br /><br />This is the life of Clay, our humble protagonist, who has been displaced from his fledgeling job in the tech industry after a semi-successful stint as a designer and twitter account manager for a bagelry. He decides to take his basic coding skills and his remarkable group of high-powered techno-savvy friends from major silicon valley companies like Google and Industrial Light and Magic and set them to unraveling the secret of the bookshop, only to discover that he couldn't have even dreamed how absurd and intriguing this mystery is.<br /><br />Sloan's novel elegantly surveys the boundaries between old technologies and new, exploring the potential of modern computing abilities (which sadly may contribute to this books eventual obsolescence) in a world still dominated by dogmatic thinking. The themes can be thought provoking and a little challenging, but the book's gripping narrative compels us to continue on the quest with Clay and his merry band of technophiles. Sloan blends elements of fantasy and science fiction with a realistic setting to create an utterly enthralling story. This would be an excellent choice for a book club as there is a lot to take in, but it's easily digestible and fun. It's an \\"adult\\" book, but I think teens, especially high schoolers, would also find it enjoyable.
8866131059|4.0|I was a bit greedy when I bought it, thinking I would be writing a lot, everyday.<br />And it turns out that I could fill up every single page, but the thickness of this notebook really makes it disturbing to write on.<br />Am considering going back to a large weekly planner or pocket plain next year.<br />(The paper quality is generally good, though a bit too thin and easy to smear; the version I bought in China mainland is extremely expensive but comes with better paper)
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Poorly edited with a weak disjointed plot. How this book is rated as well as it is I don't know.
0316223239|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and managed a neck ache as a result. It's not an uplifting story but it is so good! I imagine someone will butcher it and turn it into a film someday, but I will choose to re-read the novel. It would capture young adult readers but there are a few sensitive subjects that could cause stress for teachers.
B00846F1YW|4.0|The game is pretty good. There are some little quirks that it can take a moment to figure out...but I'm enjoying it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rent \\"Searching for Sugarman\\". It is in Redbox. Quite an amazing story, man and singer. Love love love it. We even found tickets to go see him in concert

B004X80QNG|5.0|I gave you five stars for your ability to take money without delivering a product.<br /><br />I Purchased Pocket Informant (should be Pocket Picker since it takes your $$$$$) to use the inferred functionality. As noted  in the title &quot; Does not work on Toshiba  Thrive&quot;<br /><br />I gave you my money, the least you can do is deliver the product I paid for!!!! Or a refund plus extra so you learn something.<br /><br />Shame on the company, the developer for lack of delivery and Amazon for allowing the sale of an app that is not functional.<br /><br />Web information systems should be banned for non delivery of product...shame shame shame.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is simple, but yet very entertaining. I got this app from amazon as their daily free app. It's worth the $0.99 that the developer is asking.
B00AYVRAC6|2.0|Usually I enjoy suspense novels with a twist  But the plot devices in this were too obvious, and the characters very thin. A breezy, mindless read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You get to clean your horse, it's stall, it's paddock, train it, feed it, rub it's head while it nods in ecstasy, and ride in competitions. It's an easy game.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|An interesting read but a little difficult to understand all the medical jargon.  I generally liked it. A different perspective.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was delighted to realize it was time for the second issue this trilogy to be released! I read every moment I had a chance to discover how the families fared into the next generation. The historical events are devastating with the build up of Communism and the Nazis. It makes one shudder to think how lucky we are to be Americans.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game keeps bugging me to post on facebook. My friends are not interested in my little games. So I'm just going to let them pile up.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great story, great efxs, a kickin flick in all the formats you need. And music to boot! A real winner. Highly recommend.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It has different noises that are soothing. It has traffic noises for city folk that are on a business trip. It also has a soothing water flow. So it's good for people for all ages.
B001OST0LW|5.0|The only thing i did not like was how flamboyant the riddler was they portray him as an effeminate and he is a guy i did like the cast and the action was great not a fan of the new batman i understand that is how the comics were but i am a fan of the pow zap era.  I mean at the end of the day it is just fantasy and i think when your fantasy becomes a reality it becomes a dangerous thing and I think when they keep the pow zap part of superhero movies they tell the audience this is only a movie.
B0079J28NC|5.0|I have a 7 year old that I am teaching to listen to good music rather than the hip hop crap out there today.  Classic Beatles, how can you go wrong?

B00425S1H8|1.0|Through no fault of the cable the APC UPS I needed the cable does not support USB. I used one star to draw attention to this fact.
B004T32SOK|4.0|I like it. I only use it for music. I like Cloud better. In box you have to wait for a song to open before it plays. Not like that in Cloud. But it's still a good deal. I would recommend to a friend.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game for everyone! my son even loves to play this game. the graphics are really good and dont get fuzzy
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very sweet bite of reality. I loved it. It only took a day and a half, I wish I had more
B005V5WBFG|1.0|it has a 7 day trial period, need an email address, suppose it is for the anti theft and monitor via the computer, uninstalled it, did not wait to see what happens after the trial period.
030758836X|5.0|Is it just me or is this book genius? I've read Gillian Flynn's two other books and this one had a completely different vibe than them. At first it's a game of loving husband and wife, but as the story unfolds you see a world of lies created. I'll say, it wasn't until about halfway through the book when I started to perk up and really wonder about what was going on, but I think that's the point of the book. Flynn was able to completely take me along for the ride. She really makes you choose teams between husband and wife, and then she reveals bits and pieces little by little. I am just amazed at the complexity of this book and her characters.<br />And for those complaining about the ending (and without spoiling it), in my opinion, it was the only plausible ending I could see, considering all that had happened.<br />So I think overall, this is a great book that keeps you thinking. I've officially turned into a fan of Flynn's and am anxiously awaiting another story from her.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  I am not a gamer but wanted something fun and this is it.  I definitely recommend this to all.Thanks!
0062238868|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library and enjoyed it so much I purchased two copies to give as gifts.
B005WKKI96|5.0|Excellent work.  By my opinion, Lila once again delivers the sounds and music that we have come to expect from this Mujer Bonita y cantante brillante.  Keep them coming.  I have never been disappointed.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Once again Grisham does not disappoint! The story line jumps around in different directions but keeps the book moving with the same even flow you expect from a John Grisham book. Having grown up in Memphis, vacationed and worked in all the areas of the country he writes about, he just brings everything to life.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I enjoyed reading Mile 81.  It's along the lines of Christine or Buick 8 only in a short story version.  I loved it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been playing for about two weeks and was suggested this game based on others I have. This is so addicting and fun! I am on it several times a day!!!!
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Love it on my android phone and desktop but not made for kindle HD. Acts as a virus and freezes all your apps after installation.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Fun game, It is a kick off from the angry bird series. Personally I like angry bird better. But the kids play this game often.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The way this book is written entwining god animals and to top it off an adventure. Teaches life and philosiphy. Truly entertaining. This book will take you deep down and blow your mind.<br />它 是 好 不 那 那 就博喔看家族 别说什么事故居者有其屋。
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Family fun game. Mom plays the most. I enjoy angry birds. The game is easy to understand and has multiple levels to beat. I love that it is free. Great for all ages.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book, keeps you wanting more! Can't wait for more, so so so good! Worth buying, I would read again;)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|All I know about this game is that my 8 yr old son loves it. I am a mom who will not allow violent games of bloodshed. I have reviewed the game and ordered it for him.
B004KZOXJA|4.0|Delirium is about a world where love is a disease and the only salvation is to receive a cure and live out a life that is planned for you. I really enjoyed this novel. It was beautifully written and kept me turning pages well into the night.<br /><br />However, there were drawbacks for me. I did find the story a bit predictable at times. I also didn't really bond with Alex as a character as much as I should have. I was much more interested in Lena's past and family. I also would have liked if the oppressive government was a bit stricter. It just seemed too easy for Lena to run off to all these forbidden parties and spend day after day with Alex and no one noticed.<br /><br />Having said that, I don't want to judge too much because I know there are more books in the series that could certainly change my mind. I look forward to the next installment in the series.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I love this book. I like to take notes when I read so that I can go back over key points. This book is a easy read short and will get you to think about changing your life. A must read for all.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|i like the game, greatly reminds me of League of legends but i cant conect to server now and cant play it, not my connection. if you can help in anyway email me at killerforlove@rocketmail.com

B001L83PLQ|5.0|The author has the talent to speak convincingly in many voices. She is a superlative story teller and has an engaging style.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have been fun passing the time with this game. I like that you can even  earn additional points by replaying completed games.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The book arrived in our kindle and my husband was recovering from surgery.  He enjoyed the book and never put it down until it was finished.  We will buy more Jack Reacher novels from you.<br />Elma Wife
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you like into medieval, fantasy, dragons, adventure, a tinsy bit of romance filled with mystery and much deception and violence, this book is for you! I'm hooked, obsessively hooked. It's also well written, and the characters are so well done they completely come to life. I already have my favorites. There are scheming plots galore, twists and turns, heart break and lessons. There are endless quotes and wise words in here from certain characters facing turmoil while learning life lessons. Words that I'll never forget. I'm pretty sure I'm going to love this series as an adult as much as I loved the Harry Potter series as a teenager, which says a LOT.
1451695187|5.0|I read it twice the first week I had it and gave it to a friend.  It gives me a lot to think about.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I saw Diana Ross and the Supremes in August 1968 in the Washington, DC area.  She and they were wonderful.  Seeing this concert video I am reminded that no matter what the turmoil was with Diana and her fellow Supremes, the music was timeless.  Diana proved to be a real trooper to perform in the rain, and then to return to the stage the next night to perform at her best.  This video shows both concerts.  Nice production and editing to bring this concert to life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautiful read. It opens your eyes to love and being loved. Makes you think about your own role in the universe.
B000GCFBQU|3.0|Throughout 90% of this story, it is really depressing.  At the ending it brightens, but the balance of how a book makes a reader feel could have been better.  Not Elizabeth Strout's usual great writing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Certainly lived up to the hype. Enjoyed the twists and surprises.  Ending was a little unfulfilling and predictable. Would definitely read another book of Flynn's.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|If you're searching for a strong heroine, a conflicted hero, and a slew of supernatural and fantastic sub-characters in Victorian London, you're on the right track.<br /><br />At first I thought the subject of the book might be a little contrived. Heroine wishes she was a man because they have more opportunities during that century, but Ms. McMaster surprised me. Honoria Todd needs opportunity because she's been forced to take her younger sister and brother to Whitechapel after they lost the support of their father's patron. A dangerous, nasty patron known as a blue blood who has the craving virus, which requires the infected to drink blood.<br /><br />After a few weeks of struggling to keep her family together, Honoria is summoned by the Devil of Whitechapel, a man also infected with the CV, known as Blade. He agrees to protect her from the shady side of the section of town. While her sister and Blade's cohorts think their relationship is a bad idea, they still end up involved with each other. The need to together grows deeper when Honoria makes arrangements to become Blade's thrall, a person who agrees to allow blue bloods to feed from them for money. Things are complicated by Honoria's brother's rapidly advancing disease and a new horror, a vampire that stalks the streets butchering every human in its path.<br /><br />There was never a dull moment in this book. The hero and heroine are deep characters, the plot is riveting, the setting is dark and beautiful. The sub-characters and plots also help move the story along. There are so many twists and turns throughout the novel, it was difficult to put down. Looking forward to reading the next novel in the series.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Well written with engaging characters and a brisk pace to the plot, but what really makes this story stand out is the effort to take an honest and uncompromising look at the true cost of violence. For those who have grown up with epic fantasy (like me), it provides a more mature perspective on the central ideals that drive these enduring stories. The characters are no less heroic for the nuanced and compromised choices they make.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it!<br />Wish there were more cheaper items but overall this is a very fun game very easy to play
B00505QAUY|2.0|I have no one to blame but myself for NOT reading the description! I got this as a stocking stuffer for my mom (she had read about this movie and really wanted it).. it does NOT work in regular dvd players. Price was great, just wish my stupid-self read everything :p
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can sit down and play a game or two and enjoy every minute of it.  I find it very relaxing and I never tire of it.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Love it, love it! Why don't they make this kind of movies any more? Great quality DVD, both in sound and visual.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|book was not what i thought, it was not untill the very end that the plot was revealed. a very entertaining book to read

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|An amazing film reflecting our nations history, one that more people should learn and know about at a young age. The acting is superb, the music entrancing, the sets so realistic, I saw it three times in the theatres, I can't wait to own my own copy of this phenomenal movie.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I really enjoyed her version of some Christmas standards, and some new ones I hadn't heard before.  Nice change of pace.  Love her smooth voice.
B007SGM084|4.0|I agree this book needed some editing, etc. It was an interesting read even if I don't quite understand all the craziness for it.
184657918X|4.0|I find it interesting that so many people are saying this isn't a usual Discworld novel, because it's the first one I've read (or, in this case, listened to the audiobook). It definitely made me want to read more, and I've since been going back through the previous City Watch novels from the beginning. I did find it very humorous, at several points having to pause my iPod to really enjoy the moment. I was listening to it at work, and at one point, I was laughing long enough and in such a way that one of my co-workers came over to check on me because she thought I was crying.<br /><br />So, in short, I would say this was a very enjoyable book. And if you, like I was, are hesitant to jump in so very far into the Discworld series, don't let that put you off. You might have to pay attention a bit more and just go with some things, but it's not all that hard to pick up.
0060734191|5.0|After my son spent weeks successively talking about each of the books of this trilogy in turn, I decided to take a look at the first one. I could easily see why he liked them so much, and quickly found myself reading through all three books. What a fascinating world Nix creates here! I'm not sure what I can write without giving away too much. Perhaps the following might be interesting for a parent deciding whether or not to buy it: When he asked for it, I was initially a bit uncertain, since death was obviously such a major topic, and was timidly posing myself the age-old parental question: Is this good for my child or not. This one is. (Or rather, these three are.) If anyone is still worried, the good guys in the story are among and on the side of the living. It's great fantasy.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I finally got a chance to see this movie after seeing all the commercials for it. I figured though that the commercials held the best parts of the movie and I would not be impressed. If I could be any more wrong it would be impossible! Wow what a great movie! It is an absolutely hilarious Monster parody comedy all in one. Monsters afraid of Humans and Humans worshiping the monsters!<br /><br />The story is about Count Dracula holding up to his promise to protect his diseased wife and his daughter, Mavis. Count Dracula is deathly afraid of Humans and I will not spoil the why he is, but he is protecting Mavis from ever seeing them. He built a castle to keep her safe. Every year he invites all the monsters to his safe haven to celebrate Mavis's birthday. In the movie it is Mavis's (Selena Gomez's voice) 118th birthday, and she is ready to go out into the world and see things.<br /><br />After twists and turns and the Count trying to protect Mavis too much, Mavis finally meets a backpacking boy named Jonathan. Jonathan and her \\"Zing\\", and the rest I will leave up to the movie telling you what happens. It truly is a very funny and interesting movie.<br /><br />The comedy in this movie is very good not only for children, but adults too. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie is. It was one of the better animated movies I have seen in the past few months, and I will be watching it again.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend seeing this movie!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a interesting mix of epic fiction and historical facts.  I find this genre more interesting than strictly nonfiction historical accounts. I am looking forward to finding out about what happens to the five families involved in the next book of the trilogy.
0679411585|5.0|This is an amazing book, fascinating and disturbing at the same time. There is probably nothing I can add to the hundreds of reviews of this book. However, I'd just like to say what lessons I took from it. First of all, at the risk of hyperbole, I must say that I wish every American would read this book. In it you will learn about the bravery of the American service person, and the real cost of war. It is a story that transcends the conflict in Vietnam and is very applicable to our modern military adventures, where the burden of war is carried by only a small percentage of our citizens.<br /><br />The first half of the book describes the formation what would become the 1/7 Cavalry, part of the first air mobile division (1st Cavalry Division) and its deployment to Vietnam. The 1/7th is commanded by the co-author, Hal Moore. Moore's battalion is sent into LZ X-ray and survives a battle against what would have been overwhelming odds if it were not for massive American artillery and close air support despite the expert leadership of the officers and NCOs in the battalion from Moore down and the undisputed bravery of each individual soldier. This is significant as the first major engagement between American air mobile forces and the North Vietnamese Army.<br /><br />The second half of the book, however, did not get portrayed artistically in the Mel Gibson movie. It tells the story of Moore's sister battalion, the 2/7th Cavalry, that was marching toward LZ Albany to be extracted after reinforcing the 1/7th at X-ray. While approaching the LZ, unprepared for meeting the enemy again, the battalion was attacked by three battalions of NVA soldiers. The chain of command was not able to bring artillery and air support their rescue in this engagement for several hours. The results were devastating. Both fights constitute the Battle of the Ia Drang, not just the part stylized in the movie.<br /><br />The most moving part of the book is revealed in the closing chapters. The story of two widows and two daughters bring to light how the sacrifices of soldiers not only take the lives of amazingly talented soldiers, but also dramatically affects the lives of their loved ones at home, who continue to pay the price. Reading about the aftermath and the effect on the veterans and their family members is a very emotional experience. However, even more amazing and anger inducing is the way the battle was treated by the leadership of the country. The upper management of the Army and the government refuses any lessons to be learned from this battle, and the country continued on a path that was already decided upon before the 1st Cavalry Division even arrived in Vietnam.<br /><br />I wish I could give this book more than five stars. If you enjoyed the movie, then please read this book and get the whole story.f two widows and two daughters bring to light how the sacrifices of soldiers not only take the lives of amazingly talented soldiers, but also dramatically affects the lives of their loved ones at home, who continue to pay the price.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed the book about a man's life who grew up in an orphanage.  The orphanage was run by the Catholic church in Ireland and they were not a kind bunch.  Many lasting memories haunted Jamie.  He found his reward as the book ends very nicely.
0761158820|5.0|I gave this book as a Christmas gift to my nephew who was about to turn five. He loves the monsters and plays with them frequently. He can discuss them at length and even knows their names.<br /><br />Daddy gets to do the actual assembly, and says that even a 10-year old would find them a bit challenging to assemble. He's enjoying putting them together nearly as much as my nephew enjoys playing with them.<br /><br />So the point I'm getting at is that even though this book is intended for an older audience, younger kids will absolutely love the monsters as well. The gift was a hit!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am going to miss Hazel Grace and Gus..  Could not put the book down.  Great read!!!  Gives an inside on teens dealing with cancer.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved this musical on the stage and on the 10th anniversary concert DVD, so I was not sure the movie could live up to those experiences.  To my surprise and great pleasure, the movie managed to enhance my enjoyment of reliving the story and great music.  I know I shall watch it again and again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a thriller from the very beginning and keeps you turning the pages.  The love story is beautiful and real. I love that Sparks allowed the characters to take time to develop their feelings and allows the reader to go on that journey with them.
B005LAIISA|3.0|I expected the story to be on a par with the three previous Ice Age movies I've seen, but it disappointed me.  It started off okay with the start of continental breakup, but after that I just could not accept all that additional nuttiness about pirates in the ice age as being on a par with the previous story lines.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is so easy and simple. It has helped me on my homework and I definetley think that everyone who has a kindle should get this.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book gave me the insight to very quiet people.  I now see them in a very different way, and understand that they have many unspoken opinions and knowledge.  I am trying to learn to communicate with shy people now, and it is incredible how they will open up to you if you approach them in a quiet, non-assuming way.  This book taught me a lot.  I highly recommend it to everyone; especially teachers and anyone who supervises groups of people.  There is bound to be a shy person around you.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I own a few 3d movies and this,  by far ... is the best, above all the rest !<br />Very pleased !
0807014273|4.0|Aside reading this for a class, this book helped me realize that people suffer, but we decide how we cope with it. The author was in Auschwitz and he suffered much more what most of us suffer from. We tend to suffer from being unemployed, going to court multiple times, whatever the case is but we were never put through something some survivors of the Holocaust called hell. Aside from his own experience, he teaches everyone that suffering is inevitable, but pain is something we can prevent.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|The best chapter was about how you are not your possessions. That does make you think. However, for me, Miss Minimalist goes too far. She basically says to just pay someone to manicure your lawn so you don't have to have store lawn tools or then again, why even have a lawn when you can appreciate someone else's. She also discourages crafts or hobbies that require lots of equipment or supplies. I do agree that we all have too much but I still think there has to be some balance to enjoy life.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|My daughter is a huge castle fan and had to have these books.  After she read them, I also read them and although I'm not the castle fan she was, I found them to be good mystery books which is my favorite.  It arrived quickly and was just as expected.

B00BC65Y7U|5.0|This movie is fantastic and never gets old.  I wish I could say the same about K-19 Widowmaker.<br /><br />No movie is great without an equally great soundtrack, and this movie is no exception.  Thanks Basil!<br /><br />Now buy it, play it in your car, and go full fathom five.  Just try not to do it literally like that Veyron owner who drove his car into a lake to defraud the insurance company.  So play it on the road but stay dry, and do it at night in a BMW so you can enjoy the experience of the red ambient &#34;submarine lights&#34; that BMWs have glowing in the cockpit.<br /><br />Or, get a plastic model nuclear submarine and play this soundtrack when bathing.<br /><br />Or you can play it when not doing any of the above, but you won't get the full experience.  Just sayin'
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|As one who loves to delve into fantasy/sci-fi, I have always loved the Stargate series and Atlantis is no exception.

B0049P1VHS|2.0|This half baked soap opera with the occasional zombie tossed in has only been enjoyable because my teenage son & I take such pleasure in ripping it to bits. If you must buy it though, sticking to the 1st season is your best bet because after that the series sinks into an ever deepening quagmire of ludicrous & contrived plot lines that are probably too numerous to mention in an Amazon review.<br />Although, I would like to know how zombies manage to arrest the whole rotting meat drawback so they can go on & on & on like mobile hunks of Energizer bunny meat?<br />I would also like to know why, given the plot point that the reanimated part of the zombie's brain is the \\"reptile brain\\" of pure animal reflex, the zombies aren't humping what they're not eating?<br />Or, better yet, humping what they are eating?<br />Maybe that's a bit too disturbing for the kind of geeky pseudo hipster couch potato this show seems to appeal to....<br />Strangely enough, this has been the first zombiefest I've watched where I find myself consistently cheering for the zombies.<br />If this offends the legions of Walking Dead addicts out there just try to imagine how much better the entire production would have been if the writers, aware of the eventual moment when the Governor would slide on his eye patch, had first presciently<br />given Merle a hook in place of a hand.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|hat would you do to rescue the woman you love? Fight, maim, kill? What if, after doing all of those things, the one true test left was holding back? Could you? Would you want to?<br /><br />Less than a decade before the Civil War, Django (a slave portrayed by Jamie Foxx) is being escorted, in chains, by his masters, the Speck brothers. They are traveling through a remote, wooded area when they encounter someone unexpected. Their unexpected company is former dentist, Dr. King Schultz. Schultz (portrayed by Christoph Waltz) is looking for a slave formerly owned by men he wishes to find. The slave, it turns out, is Django. The Specks have no intention of surrendering Django to the doctor and make that point very clear. The doctor then kills one Speck brother and leaves the other alive but seriously wounded. Schultz (Waltz) then informs Django that if he can identify the men he's searching for, whom Schultz is hunting in hopes of securing a bounty, and aid in their capture, Schultz will grant Django his freedom and give him $75 and a horse. Schultz also reveals that he despises slavery as a concept. Once the men Schultz was after are found and dealt with, Schultz tells Django that, as he has never given anyone their freedom before, he feels a certain responsibility. The two men become colleagues, hunting fugitives for money. In addition, the former dentist offers to help Django find the one thing he really wants: his wife Broomhilda. Broomhilda (also a slave, portrayed by Kerry Washington) was named by her original owners who were German, like Schultz. She was left scarred by her owners, who were also Django's, and then the two were auctioned separately. After a few inquiries, they learn that Broomhilda is now in the possession of well-known plantation owner and Francophile Calvin Candie and residing with Candie on the plantation counter-intuitively referred to as Candie Land.<br /><br />While some people worship Tarantino's body of work, generally speaking, I can take it or leave it. I didn't like Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, thought Inglorious Basterds was decent but overrated, but loved Jackie Brown. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, has proved his skill time and time and again and, while not every film he's appeared in could be considered quality, the fault rarely, if ever, lies with him. As for Waltz, it is refreshing to see him portray a character with redeeming qualities and he does so very well. DiCaprio, contrastingly, tends to play characters that are, or are at least meant to be, likable. Despite being well-mannered, Calvin Candie is anything but. Even so, his performance is masterful. Critics who dislike this film have come at it from both sides. Some take issue with the film for not depicting slavery seriously. Others see the depiction of Caucasians as villains as the continuation of some sort of disturbing trend. Of course, the fact that Christoph Waltz portrays one of the protagonists would seem to contradict that but, why let logic interfere with an argument? As for what I think, those who suffer typically deserve it and slave masters are shown as vicious because, more often than not, they were. I liked this film and I can't imagine why those who can see this film with an apolitical eye wouldn't.it or leave it.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|This is a fantastic album from Helloween!!!! I remember when they first came out at a dive bar in Oklahoma on the headbangers ball Tour during the Keeper of the seven keys release and were with grim reaper and Armored saint and loved that style of play.  They were new and fun and I bought every album since then,  This is a very well thought out album, It is probably one of the few album in the power metal world recently released that is very exceptional in song structure and perfectly blended with some heavy tunes with great vocals and really good musicianship.  It flows greatly and has you really getting into it song to song.  \\"Hold Me in your Arms\\" is a beautiful song. Wonderfully written and simple. I like hearing their German accents which gives them a little difference and originality of where they are from. They sing in English extremely well.  They are a band that can sing! This to me is the best record they have ever done and a album of the year contender!

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Its same old leading u to the next clue then point and find. Storyline was ok. graphics ok but some items pretty hard to find.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|When these came in, I was quite surprised to discover I received the British version & the first movie is “Harry Potter & the Philosopher’s Stone.” Everything about the movie is the same except when they say “philosopher” instead of “sorcerer.” All scenes are the same except that one word.<br />I was a little hesitant to keep it at first, but then I realized I had something that no one else around me had & it’s actually pretty neat to have the original version as it was meant to be seen in Britain.<br />The case is nothing special, but is certainly nice enough to display with my other box sets. The blu rays play great.
0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob,\\" by: William Landay is a page turner with an unexpected twist at the end.  A 14 year-old is killed at the local middle school.  The key suspect is Jacob, a classmate of the dead boy.  The title is apropos as the entire book revolves around Andy's , a former D.A. and Jacob's father, inability to believe the possibility of his son's guilt.  This disbelief leads Andy to destroy potential incriminating evidence.  While Lori, Jacob's mother is left questioning the possibility that her son is guilty.  The reader is left to choose their own side.  Jacob offers us little insight as to his guilt or innocence.<br />Andy is unable to face the possibility of Jacob's guilt due to secrets in his own past.  He is afraid of the possibility of a murder gene existing on his side of the family.  This gene potentially passed down through his male lineage.  Andy faces both an internal and external struggle to reconcile this paternal lineage.  On the other hand, Lori asks the tough questions: \\"Did I put him in daycare too early?\\"\\" Why were children always getting hurt around him?\\"  Lori wastes away in front of Andy's eyes and he keeps thinking he will help put her back together after the trial.  The tragedy of this thinking is only revealed in the final pages of the novel.<br />This novel is in keeping with the themes in \\"We Need to Talk about Kevin\\" and \\"Columbine.\\"  The reader leaves all of these novels with the questions: Could a child or did a child murder another in cold blood? If so, why? And lastly, what should the penalty be for such a heinous crime?

B0064NTZJO|5.0|An underrated crime thriller that is at once an homage to '80's style and great auteurs such as Walter Hill and Paul Schraeder. Exceptional performances by cast, from Gosling and Carey Mulligan to a surprisingly effective Albert Brooks and Bryan Cranston. Beautifully crafted by Nicolas Refn, an understated masterpiece of the genre that deserves a second viewing.
0060723513|5.0|Great story.  Wonderful message.  Very good read.  Bought this for friends and family members after reading.  This story opens your eyes to other cultures and how we adapt to our circumstances.  It also makes you question your values and focus on what's really important in life.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|As a lad of seventeen, during an all-nighter with Heineken-tippling buddies, I found myself with a liminal mindset in which a Loge might substitute for a Jumping Jack Flash, prompting the gathering to explore the vast Wagner collection of our host's father. Of course, we thought it might be cool to hear the Ride of the Walkyries. Easier said than done. We searched in a huge Walkyrie boxed set of vinyl LPs. Side after side, seemingly dozens, and we could not find it, never imagining such excitement could be set in the third act. In the meantime, we were treated to a new kind of music that occupied time, but that seemed to have no forward momentum. At the end of the evening, we realized Wagner must be an acquired, more adult taste, though one well worth acquiring. Years later, after someone dared to film the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, comes a spectacular Blu-ray set of the first great staged Ring that makes the incredible story seem to fly by. It might actually be a ring that Wagner himself might have admired. Or, at least considered a first step toward the ultimate realization of his spellbinding, practically unstageable vision. That, by the way, still has yet to happen, although this production offers a tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. In many ways, this is the best set available for believable character, motivation, vocals, ensemble acting and emotional arc, from the opening E flat major chord held for 134 bars, accompanied by the suggestion of waves on the river Rhein, until the Rheingold is returned to the aquatic maidens in charge of its safekeeping. The challenge has always been the many hours of music and the relatively limited action. The visual feast of this set makes that problem far less obvious. Actually, even in a less engaging production one can appreciate Wagner's sense of pacing. He had already done a lot to improve the flow and dramatic impact of his source material. To see what I mean, you should read the Nibelungenlied, the German source, the Volsungesage, an Icelandic source and Njal's Saga, another Icelandic source for Wotan's legal paranoia (embodied by all those runes on his spear). The Althing law council of Njal's Saga explains Wotan's fear of breaking any treaty or his word of honor. There has never been a problem with the ravishing music, but, rather, the creative limitations of the stagecraft. A few of the countless cinematic treasures of this production are the gorgeous projections (which have apparently already evolved and will continue to do so during the years the production is in use at the Met). They include waterfalls, Stygian hell worms, metaphysical fires, all-seeing eyes, Rhinemaidens treading water on white water rapids, Wotan's ominous ravens, Siegfried's seemingly tropical talking bird friend. The opera Rhinegold has the most exhilarating musical finale of any opera; and that music is now given a stunning visual equivalent. Wotan's mountain of fire is breathtaking. The world Ash Tree with the fateful weavings of the Norns is magisterial. The house of Hunding, the Gibichung hall...all wonderful. These exciting elements underscore the potential of a fully produced cinematic version of the opera, even as it reveals the dramatic issues that still exist. The many longeurs into which the action lapses will take an ingenious screenplay, not just a beautiful mis-en-scene. One can imagine the camera getting into the heads of the characters and seeing what they see or remember, for example. But, at close to 16 hours, the screenplay alone could be a project ten years in the making. In the meantime, this set enhances the wonder of the work, for which it is indispensable.<br />As for the singing. There is none better. Of course, no one ever heard Wagner's preferred Siegfried, Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld, as he died two weeks after starring in Tristan und Isolde, just before the birth of recorded sound. In fact, even Wagner never actually heard him as Siegfried, but imagined thathe would be the ultimate heldentenor. In any case, no one will top Lauritz Melchior any time soon, but Jay Hunter Morris certainly has the right look and a solid, sweet sound. He actually makes you love the character and feel shock and remorse at his loss. The Rhinemaidens and Walkyries are fabulous, proving that there really is no minor role in Wagner, no matter how short. For the first time ever, you will understand the powerful musicality of the role of Wotan, thanks to the handsome voice and splendid acting of Bryn Tervel. Deborah Voigt delivers the most beautiful performance of Brunhilde, the first in recent recorded history totally on pitch. Her work is up there with the best of Flagstad. Unlike any other, however, she owns the role dramatically. Let's not forget, her character must convince as a teenage girl, then as a woman in love, then as an avenging angel in a world out of balance. Voigt makes each phase of her journey believable. The sound is by turns pretty and heroic. It's an amazing achievement. Wagner left no comments about his first Brunhilde, Amalie Materna, and perhaps his ideal Walkyrie was over a century away. In any case, many other great singers participate here with excellence. Jonas Kaufmann and Eva Maria Westbroek are glorious as the amorous twins. Here in Blu-ray their interaction is just gorgeous and their singing, ravishing. Hans-Peter Koenig all but steals the show with his gigantic, booming bass. He's like such great artists of the past as Hans Hermann Nissen, thought to be extinct. Loge is rendered a total delight by Richard Croft who is asked to walk backward up as steep incline on a cloud of flame. He does this while producing beautiful sound. And his brother, Dwayne, puts a dent in the universe with Donner's hammer and his sterling baritone. Stephanie Blythe has given the performance of a lifetime as Fricka, whose desire for love is every bit as important as Alberich's in setting the wheels of our fateful tale in motion.<br />Anyone interested in great music and great movies must own this set. It is to be hoped that some ambitious director will buy it, too, and realize what a great epic film it would make.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked the game. Yes others should play! I love strategy and this is perfect. I insist you try this game.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is cute, but for the younger ages.  I and my elementary kids get bored with it after only 10-15 minutes.  Good graphics, good interactivity.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was probably the best book I have read. This author has a talented way of engrossing readers so that they cannot put the book down to eat or sleep

B002O2THRO|2.0|unable to watch movie, kept getting error messages so unable to stream the movie  I have seen the movie before and it is a good  so this is in no way a reflection on the movie, just the incompatibility of Amazon's service and our ISP to allow us to watch the movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used this app on my RAZR and DELL XPS laptop for nearly month now and I think it is a great tool. I use it daily and it works very efficiently.  I recommend it without reservation.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I know I must have watched the original Star Trek hundreds of times in syndication, but I never remember seeing this particular episode.  Maybe it just never got a lot of airplay where I lived at the time.  I enjoyed watching it for the first time.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Just in case anyone else was curious about this, this adapter will let you do target disk mode between a firewire-containing mac and a mac with thunderbolt and no firewire (notably all of the Macbook Airs).<br /><br />When traveling I frequently clone my primary machine whole to my Air, before this adapter I had to go through a complex and lengthy processes of cloning through intermediate drives. Now I can just mount the Air as an external drive and clone SSD -> SSD. Awesome!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I would highly recommend Sofia the First to little girls! We just love watching these shows and are really looking forward for the movie!
0060730552|5.0|Of the few books of this genre I have read, this is by far the best one!<br />The extensive use of adjectives and verbs depict their ordeal in a very touching manner.<br />No wonder this book was chosen for the O Levels exams in Britain...
B000PEX1IE|5.0|This is a timeless movie representing physical comedy and farce with actors who grew to be stars in their own right
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just had to give this book five stars. I won't give yet another detailed synopsis of this book, like a million other reviewers before me have done. Instead, here are simply a few sentences about why I loved this novel.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I've never read a Nicholas Sparks book before this. But apparently, I've been missing out. In fact, I've never even seen a movie adaptation of one, not even The Notebook *gasp!* - a travesty, I know. This particular genre just isn't one I seem to fancy. However, I've changed my mind, at least as far as Mr. Sparks' works go. His writing is smart yet easy breezy. Not for a single instant did I feel like the reading was a chore. Actually, I couldn't put it down. His imagery is so captivating, it was so simple for me to picture all of the characters and scenery without even trying. I felt like I was there, in the sleepy North Carolina town with Katie and Alex. Katie, the protagonist was perfectly likeable without being sickeningly sweet. Same goes for Alex. I found myself rooting for these guys the whole way through. The climax had me on the edge of my seat and I could not even begin to think about taking a break from the reading until it was over. The plot, exciting and actually perfectly plausible.<br /><br />So, friends and lovers, no matter what type of book tickles your fancy, I think just about anyone could enjoy this piece. Especially, if you're not so much into romance and prefer a bit of action. From what I've gathered, Sparks has strayed from his usual, mellow writing in this suspense-packed novel. Enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG how could they do that to her? I do badly want to read book 3 just to find out how this whole fare ends.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its awesome. just enough one can do with a free app! exporting options amazing! enough collage options,  colors and fonts. could use updates on stickers and clip arts like upcoming holidays but I'm sure that's pushing it for being free.
B00973902K|5.0|We used this for a professional modeling session. It was a great, upbeat song, that kept all of us moving!
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|The game is pretty fun. It's not too difficult. Great for when you just want some mindless entertainment when your sitting around relaxing.
B00846WWVM|5.0|My four and six year old boys love this game. They first saw it on their cousins tablet so I checked to see if Amazon carried it. Of course they did!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never thought I would like pinterest as much As I do.  The recipes are so much fun to pin.  The boards are so much fun to create and to have others to repin your stuff is such a nice compliment.  And pinterest has no drama :)
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It stinks I think this game was never created. You stink whoever made this piece of junk don't by it it stinks and they give you a time limit what are we in school heak to the no don't by it it STINKS
B004TL3R24|5.0|This does exactly what it is supposed to. Easy to fit and very minimal. Just what I was after :)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This app is just like the game &quot;End War&quot; but with better graphics and online multiplayer. You should get it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game a lot. It has horses,racing,and mini games. This game is sooooo fun and awesome. If you buy it you won't regret it. If you love horses this is the perfect thing for you.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the concept but when I try to use my coins or diamonds to &quot;purchase&quot; items, it gives me a more expensive item and charges me full price. Then when I try and use an item it uses a more expensive items on the page. and I cant find a customer service address to ask for help.
1608862771|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised that the book held very little words and the book was full pages of drawings busting out with ideas.  I will buy the other books in the set.  If you are an artist or a graphic artist ......You will appreciate the work that goes into each art work as  your eyes  find it hard to focus  on one section, soon after being wowed! you can finally look at the detail.<br />recommend this highly.
B000VHVGM8|4.0|Fun comedy. Kept my interest throughout the scenes. Not the best comedy I've viewed; but some scenes were extremely funny.
B004LWZW88|5.0|I am a huge animation film person.I love watching these movies they keep me entertained and my nieces and nephews:)

B00280LYIC|4.0|Goodreads Description- Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school... again. And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus' master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect.<br /><br />Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus' stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.<br /><br />I have to say that when I found out that I had to read this book for a book club I was a little apprehensive.  I am not a fan of the fantasy trend in young adult literature and worried that this would end up like some of the other popular teen reads (which will remain unnamed) that it would be filled with star crossed teen love and angst along with the ever popular vampires, shapeshifters, and other popular paranormal creatures.  I haven't seen the movie and only had the small book description to go on for the plot introduction.  I knew it had rave reviews, but so do all of the other young adult fantasy series that are being published at an astonishing rate.  However, despite my true lack of interest, I hesitantly started to read.  And guess what...I was hooked!  I loved the characters and how the author developed them for the reader by revealing their identities slowly.  I really liked the idea of the Greek gods still ruling the earth and spawning children with mortals.  It seemed to me like a unique storyline and NOT like the other recent teen novels.<br /><br />The book moves at a fast pace because the reading level is more for middle grade students rather than high schoolers but the story was still interesting enough to keep my adult attention.  Percy's quest had just the right mix of action that was fully developed rather than just cut off to keep it short.  This wasn't a novel that I would criticize and say that I wished it were longer.  The author did an excellent job at writing a full novel filled with everything an adult wants in a book that is fit for a 12 year old to read.  As a former teacher who knows something about children's literature, it is a wonderful talent if an author can keep the adult and children interested.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was that it seemed to copy the Harry Potter series.  The main character, Percy, was comparable to Harry and his two friends, Annabeth and Grover, doubled as Ron and Hermione.  I wish he was able to develop the main characters into something more unique.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this novel, especially to people like me who are leery of the whole fantasy genre.  I am going to go ahead and get the next books in the series from the library to see what Percy and his friends are up to next.  4 stars.dents rather than high schoolers but the story was still interesting enough to keep my adult attention.

B001K3EXTA|5.0|The movie was well produced.  Kept my interest throughout.  Read the book so long ago that it was great to see it live.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen and her unique sense of humor.  Reading this book was almost like sitting next to her and having a conversation with her - she writes very similarly to how she speaks. I find her to be kind, inspirational, an amazing humanitarian, and most of the time just hilarious.  She can make me laugh even on those days when I don't feel like laughing.  I loved &#34;Seriously,&#34; and I would recommend this book to anyone who is an Ellen fan.  As well, I would also recommend this book to those who may not be familiar with Ellen and have not had the opportunity to observe her wit, style, imagination, gentle nature and desire to make this world a kinder place.  Thanks, Ellen, seriously.
B009G78EE2|5.0|When a hip-hop artist can portray a solid story throughout a whole album they get a thumbs up from me.  Good variety of beats and overall solid album.  Not just a one-hit wonder.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Hope the movie got the emotions across.  Thought provoking and heart warming. Although I think we make our own happy endings.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|not only dan u see alot about your battery life you can customize it! perfect app to meet the needs of almost any picky chooser. Awesome app!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book and provides a good ending to the series.  Since I always recommend a series be read in order, there is no reason to recommend this book as anyone who has read the first two is hooked and doesn't need a recommendation to finish the series.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Not likely to go viral because the central character is so unusual. Great cinematography. Top character actors. That' is all.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love it! before the most recent update on explore mode there where no monsters. but now that it does have monsters I love it!
B000M5AJQI|4.0|Great Story, Great Acting.  One of the few good movies Hollywood has put out.  Would recommend this movie Highly to anybody.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|got it quick int the mail was in really really good cond. just like new very happy with purchase of course
B0050DIWFC|4.0|From a legal perspective I thought this book was accurate with a lot of common sense explainations of the American criminal justice system. I enjoyed the underlying story partly narrated by a career district attoney under oath, while being questioned by rival district attorney. The ending of this book did having some interesting twists, but these twists, from my perspective, were somewhat undeveloped and therefore, to me, were somewhat disappointing. Thus a rating of 3.3.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Although this book confused me from time to time, the ending was all worth it! I loved it and now I can't wait to see the movie.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Am going through the first two years of Downton as I have time and thoroughly enjoying it. Am goiing to purchase year 3 when I finish one and two as I missed a couple of those.  All of this is well done, plot is tight, humor is spot on and I frequently laugh out loud.  Love the twists and turns in the plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book so much and could not put it down. The twists and turns really kept this from being another normal love story!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Was a little taken back with his 'mystery' type book...not his usual.  It was good, however I prefer his 'softer' novels.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|How can one not love Sinatra? He is such a classic romantic. His heart and soul are poured out into his music. The lyrics are heartfelt and breathtaking, if you take the time to listen.<br />Honestly, I don't know how anyone can compare today's music to this. I can listen to him everyday, yet still hear something new.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game with my 8 year old. it is a great way to encourage him to think on strategies. he needs to be an abstract and concrete thinker at the sametime.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Nice look back at one of Hollywood's landmarks.  Nice to see people appreciating the history behind how some of the best music of our generation was recorded.
B004I744AS|5.0|My Kindle Fire 8.9 didn't have a dictionary which interfaced with written texts, though it did come with a dictionary which you could look up words.  This defines words when you touch the world like the traditional Kindles do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a good mystery with some interesting and surprising twists and turns.  I do recommend it to others.
B000QUCNXG|4.0|I loved the voice of the storyteller.  Naturally, some of the viewpoints didn't sit comfortably with me which I enjoy.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|It was awesome thrilling the entire time. I love it. The BEST BOOK EVAR!!!!!!!!!!! sorry about repeating myself but it was really good.
0321885112|3.0|I think the headline says most of it.  The reason I wouldn't do the video edition is because the videos are really short (maybe a 2 mins or less for most of them), there aren't many of them and some of them I had viewed on the author's website before purchasing the book.  They also repeat what's written in the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great script and wonderful actors!!  Very well done.  Suspenseful, yet not over done.  This is a complete masterpiece that the whole family will enjoy watching.
B006OB3K56|4.0|If nudity and sex offends you, you need to skip this movie. It is pretty blatant. I was watching a talk show and Michael Fassbender was a guest. I thought this guy looks familiar. When the moderator started talking about Fassbender's penis having its own website, I knew who he was. This movie is about a sex addict (Fassbender) whose sister comes to live with him. She has sexual issues of her own and both of them spend a lot of time in the nude. There is quite a bit of full frontal for Fassbender. I thought the story of how the two get along and the affect the sister has on his life was very intriguing. I really liked the movie and I'm glad that I bought it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like the challenge of the higher levels.  Simple yet challenging.  Fun for all ages.  Easy to learn and addictive to play.  Fun.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|first things first I am a big comic book nerd. DC comics and the Justice League has always been a personal favorite of mine. I love the modern twist to make the show relevant and it's just as  edgy enough to do the green arrow justice. definitely worth watching
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show love it beautiful set. I would recommend watching. I can see where anyone under 25/30 may find boring but I'm 33 and love it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great movie.  Got it for my son and his family.  No bad language or sexy scenes.  Great uplifting story of this young girl who lost her arm in a shark attack.
B002YCVWXQ|3.0|The movie is well crafted, but the signature Tarantino's stand offs get long and tedious pretty quickly. Lots of blah blah, and little Tarantino's gruesome, nice violence.<br />Also, Brad is quite bad here, not sure what was he thinking when he got this role and played it like that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose 5/5 because it was  a good book that explained an  talked alot about life and what we care about in high school. It talked about love an  friendship and honestly made me reflect on my own life. It was a great book
B008GM1G70|5.0|Particularly at the end with the conversation at the pinball machine with the theory that there is not time, that there is only one moment in time and that it is a perpetual test that God gives us in His mercy, until we choose Him once and for all.
B00340LM8C|4.0|Love the old classic films.  This was one to rememberd the color and picture was clear and sharp. Would recommend for any classic film fan.
B007RV5T1U|5.0|Did not know of Piña before I saw video in your line up......... I was so moved by the dances she created and the way the film maker intertwined her life....interviews with the artists about Piña ....and her choreography.  I hope this film reaches many others like myself who are unaware of her work!
B008M7JODC|4.0|Although the premise is a bit hard to believe, the show is a great sci-fi procedural in the style of the X-Files. I started watching because the show has finished and friends tell me that the conclusion of the series is satisfying.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Great book with some great twists and scenes.  A little too long for my taste.  Could have shortened by 100 pages or so.
B003U51D58|5.0|This show kept me very entertained, I would watch it everyday one after the other and never got bored. I loved the fact that every show was sequential to the next in every piece of the story, that the more you watched, the more curious you get to find the reason why this people got lost in this magnificent, beautiful and dangerous island. If you like suspense, and tons of drama, you will enjoy this show very much. I did not like very much the ending, because to me a few questions remained unanswered, but probably because my expectations were so high up, and that was the only way to end it...in any case it was a great story and kept me addicted to it until the very end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|the best ....unable to put it down.  i will recomend it to anyone that wants to live a love and extreme love story
B0076UXKDG|5.0|Include with the package is the grip plus one MS-D12 (to use for 8 of the AA battery) and one MS-D12EN (to use for the standard Nikon EN-EL15 or EN-EL18 battery) no additional battery are included. you can reuse your Nikon EN-EL15 or pick up 8 AA rechargeable.<br /><br />Below is my feed back base on the 4 months usages<br /><br />Pro:<br />  Leverage the AA rechargeable battery for longer video and taken picture(cheaper replacement AA battery and available anywhere.<br />  Better grip for portrait<br />  Built quality, feel solid like the D800 body<br />  Controls dial<br />  Look like it is part of the camera (one piece).<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Cost - but if you are going to spend 3000+ on a camera, don't want to risk shorts out anything in the camera<br />  Heavy and big - Measure and make sure that with this grip it will still fit in your bag :)<br /><br />Other than that, I have not encounter any issue with it, I did pickup an additional MS-D12 case with this so that I can have the addition battery case to house the 8 of the AA ready when needed.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-MS-D12-Battery-Holder-MB-D12/dp/B0077VDY12/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1361855548&sr=1-1&keywords=MS-D12
B007IXWKUK|5.0|what can i say is just something to write home about it...is a must for anyone that is in love
B00APUYWYA|5.0|In spite of the fact that this movie follows a formula, it has some good singing and was quite enjoyable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|when you start the first need to read the triolygy.  a must for everyone .  have to share with your friends
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This book presents the reader with raw, uncut descriptions of the human rights crisis that exists in North Korea. I hope this book can serve as a wake-up call for action.
B008MM9630|3.0|A fun little game...biggest down fall is it relies on our money to really get anywhere. Not that it fun, it is an enjoyable game.<br /><br />.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|One of the best seasons to date! This is basically how my life is cause i am a geek and a nerd and all my buddies do basically the same thing except we are younger (sad isnt it?) Highly recommend this season over the REST!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I know it is &#34;only solitaire&#34;, but this game is fun! Keeps you on your toes. Didn't think it would be this much fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The intrigue continues.......Im So glad I was able to get season 3 on amazon, would not have wanted to wait any longer!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Gave as a Christmas present to family member. His being a huge Batman fan made this purchase very easy. Couldn't go wrong!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Better than the first one.  Can't wait for the next.  Although I cannot imagine how he will get another 50 years or more into one book.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|We've watched a lot of 'barely worth it to watch' movies over the last few months and questioned- are there any great movies from 2012?  Finally, a round of new releases worth the watch and ARGO was terrific.<br />Highly recommend the film as it is well cast with big-name players but they don't overshadow one another in this movie.  The fact it is based on a true story is fascinating and for those of you that remember the overthrow of the Shah and the rise of Komeni, recreated footage is chilling and well-done.<br />Great edge-of-your seat thriller, no sex and very little bad language.  Well Done Ben Affleck!
1596680296|4.0|Great resource book. Wonderful explanation of wool weights/plies.  easy to follow directions for making the socks. I'll be using this book for a long time for trouble spots and how to fix them or eliminate them all together.
B005ARYEPK|4.0|I bought this for my daughter who loved the remake. First she said it sucked, but watches it regularly. Like I said, classic.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome.... Never expected the twist and turns...great characters and story lines... Would recommend whenever a chance comes up to watch
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I enjoyed the storyline. A good and solid cast took it over the top. One of the better vampire / werewolf movies out there.
0307887448|4.0|This book is candy for anyone who likes sci-fi, grew up in the 80s, or has played video games. The story follows the 80s movie model of having an underachieving kid who doesn’t have any friends end up being the one to outsmart everyone else and become the hero.<br /><br />Clearly Cline had the time of his life writing this book, and his enthusiasm and non-stop nostalgia can occasionally dominate the story and creep into author intrusion, my all-time literary pet peeve. I don’t want to get into details, but it can be hard to keep up with the wave of cultural references from the worlds of role-playing games, arcade games, 80s movies and music, and any other niche reference of geekdom or fandom or whatever (do you know what a vorpal blade is?). Luckily if you really don’t know what something is you can easily look it up on the internet.<br /><br />Great story, cool adventure, and interesting glimpse at a version of what could be. This book is going to make a fun movie, and is one of the more inventive sci-fi novels to come out in the last few years.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Really, if you only had one &#34;album&#34; to pick for the rest of your life - this would have to be the one. Fell in love with Bob when this was first released and it began a lifelong love of reggae.
0800177363|5.0|When this film came out I did not understand the ramifications and the available teaching modality I could glean from it. Very well done.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Hard to put down.  These are the first books I purchased to read on my Kindle (which I love).  I'd been wanting to read these for a long time and really happy that I finally purchased them!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really enjoyed this show, especially in HD.  Waiting for season three  to become a free instant video option.<br />Soon I hope!!!!!
0486475824|5.0|Thank you for making this resource available.  It will help fill the requirement for a class my daughter is taking.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I love this book.  Quixote-like, a self-taught medievalist who lives with his mother battles corruption at home, at school, and in the cinema.  Then he is forced -- kicking and screaming -- to enter the world of business.  Its an amazing ride.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this really helps because it helps me with my math homework. and the best thing is that it is free!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|We watched this movie as a family and really enjoyed it!  Some parts were scary for my 4 year-old, but in the end he really liked it.  I highly recommend it!
B003E2UQMS|5.0|I love the way he writes, small chapters and only by the end of each one you find out that the subtitles are taken from a meaningful sentence that you've just read. He addresses mental illnesses without that burden, even presenting the pain within this theme. Smart, strong and human characters. Loved it!! :)
B00683JK9K|4.0|Its really greally great to do the puzzles in the kindle. I am addicted. Do need a bigger puzzle selction if I have to pick somethin to improve. Otherwise great!
