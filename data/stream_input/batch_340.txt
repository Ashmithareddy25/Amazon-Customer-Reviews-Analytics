B000002MG1|5.0|This gem by R.E.M. is one of those classic albums that just holds you in its grasp for its duration. Everything about it just screams high quality and it's wonderful to listen to in any type of mood you may be in. A true classic from the 90s, nobody should be without this album, regardless of your tastes.
B00000IPAX|3.0|I'll keep it simple.. I love Blink 182's style, the album is great, and yet the incessant swearing and vulgar lyrics makes it a bit hard to listen to.<br />I love rock, and this album is a great one.. but I wish they had a clean version...<br />Definately not one for your teens if you're a parent..
0783233477|5.0|Many say this movie was far too long and far too uneventful.  Wrong!  Sure, it is 3 hours long, but the 3 hours has such great dialogue and passion.  The plot is just so rich and enveloping.  You get drawn into the storyline, and what a story it is!  The actors do a marvelous job with it, as well.  I was completely taken in by the story and experience an emotional rollercoaster every time I watch it.  And I have watched it many times!  Every time it is as if I am experiencing the movie for the first time.  It never loses its dramatic and emotional appeal.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to look past the 3 hour running time and take a chance on a masterpiece of a film.  It will definitely remain one of my favorite films of all time!<br />So, give it a chance!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park rocks the music world.  All of their cd's are the bomb.  Faint, Somewhere I belong, Figure, In the End, Crawling, and Don't Saty are some of my favorite songs.  I would recommend that you wouldn't even stop to think about buying um' and just go right ahead!
B00001OH7O|5.0|Are you new to Bowie's music? Did his glam phase scare you? Or maybe his techno, drum'n'base, or &quot;plastic soul&quot; phase? Well, like they say, &quot;you got to learn to walk before you can run&quot;. Start from this album, Hunky Dory. I really do not want to categorize Bowie's music because it is a mixture of different genres that makes his music so unique and special, but if I have to choose, I say this music is in a &quot;pop&quot; category. The album contains many melodic &quot;pop-ish&quot; tunes like &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Oh! You pretty thing!&quot; that do not overwhelm you with weird synthesized noise or just plain weird sound. Lyrics may be little out there but the songs themselves are very easy to listen to. You'll love this album. I can honestly say that all the songs in here are strong and I love 'em all. How often do you run into an album that has all the songs you love? Get this album, you will not regret it!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 - Judgment Day, this second Terminator movie by hard-working and imaginative director James Cameron has all five stars. This movie was a true hit in the early 90's but is still a great classic in the 21st century, with many movies that cant live up to those special EFX and action scenes this is an unforgettable action/SCI fiction movie. Arnold's character the &quot;Cyberdynes System model 101&quot; loses the ever so cool spotlight in T2 when a much more advanced shape-changing LIQUID METAL Terminator the &quot;T1000&quot; (Played brilliantly by Robert Patrick) is sent back to destroy or what should I say TERMINATE John Connor the future resistance against the machines. <br />Great special EFX and Action scenes with a spectacuar finish no-doubt thought up by the mastermind of the terminator James Cameron.<br />The Ultimate Edition DVD provides loads of special features and a directors cut version with never before seen deleted scenes.<BR>Not to mention the DVD enhances the entire viewing of the movie with more spectacular looking Special EFX.<br />A truly captivating movie an ABSOLUTLY MUST OWN ON DVD FILM!
B0000AR8NK|3.0|I was bit disappointed by this highly anticipated Bowie album. It's not that songs are bad, but it's just that I don't &quot;feel&quot; anything spectacular about this album. When I buy Bowie's album, I expect it to be something special, something unique, but this one didn't do it for me (maybe I was expecting too much?) That said, I still like the songs in Reality, but don't expect too much. It's not Aladdin Sane, that's for sure.
B000092ZYX|4.0|First of all, I enjoyed this album very much, Sail to the moon makes me smile every single time I hear it, The main problem I have is reviewers who keep acting as if Radioheads political stance is this brand new thing. If you read into the lyrics on Ok Computer, Kid A, or even the bends, you would find many references to our modern society and its many problems, it just so happens that on this album its target was american politics, instead of culture.  I don't understand why people can't listen to music with such lyrical content and enjoy it for what it is, music. Just because he feels a certain way doesn't mean everyone has to, or vice versa, just because the President of the United States says something, doesn't mean you or I or Thom yorke have to agree with that....I thought that was America 101.  Hmmmm I guess open minds exceptance and understanding isn't cool anymore.
B000002UAU|3.0|With the hyperbole surrounding this album,one would think the discovery of the silver chalice of music had been made.To the contrary, this is several rungs down the list of the Fab Four releases.<BR>Which is not to say this isnt a great album.To be sure,the creative juices were running high(along with the Beatles themselves),But a careful listening to thier previous 2 releases<BR>(Rubber Soul, Revolver)would show that much of the ground here<BR>had already been broken.Unlike those 2 albums,however,this one was elaboratly produced,taking over 600 (!) hours to complete<BR>these 13 recordings.As a result,the effect is much more calculated than one would surmise from reading the rhapsodic<BR>reviews found here and other places.<BR>As it is ,Sgt. Pepper is a delightful pop listen,worthy of attention but not awe or reflexive genuflection.
B00008PW2D|3.0|Sex in the City always has it's funny and interesting moments, but by season 5 it was running a little dry. The situations the characters got in were progeressively stupider and stupider and some of the humor was far too crude to fit the tone. However, it was still worth watching, though I wouldn't buy this season unless I was a huge fan.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I would have to say this is one of the best albums I have heard as of late, from the more popular music genres. What else could you expect from A Perfect Circle? Maynard puts on a great performance. That guy has an awesome voice. The Nurse who loved me and A Stranger are quite beautiful songs coming from a metal band. The CD has great atmosphere tense to it, and influence of their first album and Tool is seen, yet it's different. This is a beautiful album really is. Pet and The Outsider are the heavier songs from the album, and The Package is a great opener that reminded me of Tool, being a longer and more complicated piece. I would write a better review, but I just got it... but everyone that likes hard rock/ heavy metal or you are a fan of tool, or even A Perfect circle of course... Check this album out... its great.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|In the great tradition of movies, the sequal has outdone the original. There are a few CG fight scenes (Blade vs. Messenger Vamps) and (Blade vs. Nomak) which only add to the quality of the movie. The princess seems to be a biologist, the Bloodpack wouldn't stand a chance with Blade, and the Reaper's seem to posess some intelligence. They easily attack the group in the nightclub and the sewers. There are a few questions about some of the scenes.<br />How does Nomak know martial arts? How could Whistler turn after he killed himself; unless he didn't shoot himself. What was Chupa going to say when he started &quot;A man without fear&quot;? Are there any limits when it comes to Marvel Comics and the movies?<br />Most important, will there be a third? I recommend this movie to anybody who either collects Wesley Snipes memorabilia or anything relating to Marvel Comics.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|First, I wholeheartedly enjoy this album.  That being said, it has a slightly different style than did Mer de Noms.  First, it is a bit more mellow.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  It leaves the album with a thoughtful feel to it, but some fans may be turned off by this.<BR>  The first four songs are near musical perfection.  If I weren't afraid of limiting the life of this album, I could listen to these songs on repeat for hours on end.  The next four songs, though, take a little longer to sink in, and even then, sometimes approach filler material.<BR>  The Nurse Who Loved Me, a Failure cover (well, &quot;tribute&quot; or even parody according to Maynard), is actually one of the best songs on this album.  After this, the last three songs (well, two, I suppose; Lullaby is a song only in the most cursory sense) fill out the album well.<BR>  I was tempted with the five star rating, but despite excellent production and song writing, I was ever so slightly disappointed with Thirteenth Step. Plus, five star ratings are thrown around far too lightly; only a perfect album should get five stars.  This one comes close, but still ends up short.
B00005JM0B|5.0|This film kept me on the edge of my seat! I was waiting ages for it to be released, and when it did, I was not disappointed. The non-stop action scenes were suberb and Schwarzenegger, at 56, you were brilliant. I especially enjoyed this film as it had a comical side to it. The acting was top notch and I can't wait for T4 (which was hinted at the end!) I give this film a rating of 5 stars as it reached the standard of its predecessors with enhanced graphics, better stunts and a sexy woman, in the form of Kristanna Lokex. If you haven't seen it yet, this film will blow you away...
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This is the follow up album to the stellar Mer De Noms.  Like Mer De Noms, it is hard to describe.  The two best songs are &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;Weak And Powerless&quot;.  It certainly is similar to Mer de Noms in that it isn't instantly accessible.  You'll have to listen to this a few times before you can give it a true rating...
B00009V8Z9|5.0|The opening line of this album is, &quot;Oh, this is the start of something good. Don't you agree?&quot; I couldn't agree more. This guy combines fluttering piano melodies, with thoughtful, heartfelt lyrics, and a soulful, tender voice. The combination keeps you interested from the first note to the last. In a time where more and more singer/songwriters are popping up on the scene, Gavin DeGraw is a standout. He plays both the guitar and piano, and his voice brings to mind Stevie Wonder with a bit more tenderness. Standout tracks include &quot;Just Friends&quot;, &quot;I Don't Wanna Be&quot;, and my favorite, at least at the moment, &quot;[Nice to Meet You] Anyway&quot;. If your into the current Singer/Songwriter craze, enjoy finding up and coming artists destined to hit it big, or just enjoy music in general, this CD needs to be in your collection. You will not regret it.
0783240287|5.0|Those two words sum up my feeling on this film. Thought my review is one of the hundreds here ^.^ I thought i should share my thoughts on this film which has moved me in a new direction. <BR> First of all, this is a GREAT family film, ok....the scene with Mrs. Potiphar is a bit *bizarre* and it does seem to imply something more.... (But i think one of the best parts of movies like this are scenes like that, ones you can watch early in life and then look back when your older and go YIKES! lol..) ok..going on..-four words- MARIA FRIEDMAN KICKS #%@#!!!! She ties this whole production together and has an amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast, the thought provoking part is with this(chemistrys like the one between the Narrator and Joseph is very dangerous to a fanfiction driven 15 year old spazzy teenage girl^.^)<BR>     Anyway, my little cousins LOVE this movie and watch it whenever I come over(me being the big Maria Friedman fan). Donny Osmond is wonderful as Joseph, especially during &quot;Close Every Door&quot; and Benjamin Calypso (we understand how hard it must have been to not laugh during that) Robert Torti is a hysterical pharaoh, and everyone just is sensational!! This is a definate DVD to add to you collection!!!!!!!!!! Spread the colored coatness!!!!!
0783244320|2.0|OK, I'll admit that I don't get the attraction of Star Trek.  It was an amazingly stupid show, and I never did understand why my brother was glued to it each week.  Now twenty-some years later, we have &quot;Galaxy Quest,&quot; which, to my mind isn't that far off from &quot;Star Trek&quot; as it would like people to think.  It would like you to think it's poking fun at the Trekkies, but it really didn't play much differently than an actual episode of &quot;Star Trek.&quot;<br />I watched the film (rented, thank goodness, not purchased) to see Alan Rickman, and I'm disappointed that he would waste his time with such drivel, even if his character (&quot;I've done 'Richard III,' for God's sake!&quot;) may be somewhat like himself.  Alan Rickman isn't hard up for work, I'd think, and to play second fiddle to Tim Allen is one of the low points of his career.  If you want to see Rickman being the clever fellow he is and stealing the show, then see &quot;Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves&quot; or &quot;Truly Madly Deeply.&quot;  <br />Leave this one to the geeks.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This album is almost a masterpiece. It fills the ears with sounds that are deep and rich. Bruce's vocals sound killer. The lyrics are deep and spiritually moving. If you're a Gnostic-Christian, neo-Platonic mystic like me, you'll be swept away by Dance of Dance.Track 1, \\"Wildest Dreams\\": Fast and uplifting. Sounds like a tune that could have been a B-side on A Brave New World. 3 out of 5 stars.Track 2, \\"Rainmaker\\": I love this song. This tune is Bruce's Gnostic side for sure. Very much like his Chemical Wedding and Accident of Birth. 5 out of 5 stars.Track 3, \\"No More Lies\\": A beautiful intro. Sounds like it should have been on The X Factor. With Bruce, it works. 4 out of 5 stars.Track 4, \\"Montsegur\\": Fast and furious. Brutal assault on the senses. This tune is a masterpiece. The chorus rules. Perfection! 5 out of 5 stars.Track 5, \\"Dance of Death\\": A medieval-sounding intro, then Bruce begins the tale... A slow-starter, picks up, gallops along. What \\"Fear of the Dark\\" should have been. 4 out of 5 stars.Track 6, \\"Gates of Tomorrow\\": This tune is ponderous. Bruce's voice sounds spent--high notes cracking. I skip over this tune. 2 out of 5 stars.Track 7, \\"New Frontier\\": Same as Track 6. 3 out of 5 stars.Track 8, \\"Paschendale\\": An epic! Unbelievable tune! A masterpiece! Medieval-like intro, picks up, Bruce is extravagant on vocals. The band sounds completely in synthesis. Bruce lifts this tune to the realm of classic Maiden! 5 out of 5 stars.Track 9, \\"Face in the Sand\\": One two many long intros. However, once it starts, it happens--Gnostic lyrics; deep and meaningful. 4 out of 5 stars.Track 10, \\"Age of Innocence\\": Lyrically mature tune. Drums come out. Guitars spiral. Gnostics will feel it spiral. This one takes a few listens and an acute ear. Somehow it works--comes together nicely. 4 out of 5 stars.Track 11, \\"Journeyman\\": I love Bruce's solo albums' ballads, so I'm prejudicial about this tune. What I love about it is the way Bruce sings it. He is depressing and mellow. I'd like to die feeling the way he does when he sings it. Just go into infinity and blend into equality, and all desires come to rest. \\"I know what I want. And I'll say what I want and no one can take it away. I know what I want and I'll say what I want. And no one can take it away,\\" a beautiful chorus. 5 out of 5 stars.This album gets 4 out of 5 stars only because of tracks 1, 6 and 7. This album has 8 solid-to-great tracks on it. Simply put: Iron Maiden has proven it is still the best metal band on the planet.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I've been pretty dissapointed with the romantic comedies lately. Then Serendipity came along, and I was so intrigued by the story line and concept, I felt like I was sucked right into the movie. This truly is a great film and I would recommend it to everyone. I've only read a handful of negative reviews on this film, and it seems the critics are pretty lame and unromantic themselves. Instead of seeing the beauty of love and destiny, they take extra steps to find useless negative things about the movie that are irrelevant. Enjoy this movie for what it is.

B00008PW2E|5.0|Six Feet Under is the best show on television. It is deep, smart, and sexy.  It deals with controversial issues but is still hilarious.  It is likely that the people that don't like the series are either too dumb or too much of a prude to understand and enjoy it.  I watched the complete first season in one sitting-very addicting! I intentionally did not watch the last series on HBO, so I could watch in order-now don't tell me it may not be released!  What a bummer.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Citizen Kane was a real disappointment. Totally unoriginal plot, bad lighting, cheesy sets. Boring too. And gosh, what is with that Rose Bud thing? That was freaky!!! Woah dude!!! Anyway this movie was whack & mad boring cause you don't even see the dude porkin' the girl, and she isn't even really hot anyway. It was a bummer too that it was in black and white and all the guys looked the same cause they all wore suits. The music was all weird and whack, yo. I didn't like it. It didn't have a good beat or dance rhythm section. But it was mad sweet, the dude's crib, but he just be pacing around like, whassup? He should have had a mad party and had mad homies and sum real ladies up in that piece. I thought to my self how could u be so rich & be so messed up, yo?
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is a must buy. Mer de Noms was great, and this might even be better. This album has lots of variety, with some slow songs, and then there's also a good share of much harder songs. Maynard, as always, has brilliant lyrics, and the musicianship is excellent. The Package, The Outsider, Weak and Powerless, and The Noose are some of the highlights of this cd. Even if you aren't A Perfect Circle fan, there is a good chance you will fall in love with this cd, if you give it a chance.
B000002UAR|5.0|This song (&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;) by Paul, one of the band's most beautiful ever, depicts quite well the essence of the 'Revolver' album from 1966. A blend of styles and influences, a transition point for them that started back in the preceeding 'Rubber Soul' and served as a bridge to the masterpiece 'Sgt. Pepper...'<br />The album contains tracks that were composed under the influence of pot and acid (&quot;She Said, She Said&quot; and the experimental closing track), tracks that take the band's earlier work one step beyond with the use of instruments foreign to their music until then (strings on &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, sitar on &quot;Love You To&quot;, Motown-type horns on &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;), and as a whole, it constitutes a recording effort where they took on more of a leading role in the studio.<br />No record collection can be complete without this album, its predecessor and, indeed, most of the following Beatles albums.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|the album is so good.<BR>its better than heathen.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Well it's been little over a year since I was blessed with what is to me the greatest album of all time, Heathen by David Bowie was... no, is the masterwork of the music history. I was not too surprised however, Bowie's works are never anything short of brilliant, but Heathen still blew me away.<br />About a month ago I heard that Bowie had a follow up album coming out this week and was shocked and amazed, how could I not have heard that a new album was in the works? I, who owns nearly 35 Bowie recordings? That amazed me, but what shocked me was how soon a new album was coming out. In my mind artists who release albums too soon after their last usually produce a half arsed missable coffee coaster.<br />All the same, my loyalty towards Bowie provoked me to buy his new album &quot;Reality&quot; and at a first listening I was disappointed, not enough to make me say &quot;no more Bowie, never again!&quot;. I didn't cry myself to sleep, instead I listened to it again, and again, and found myself humming the tunes to myself while not listening to the album and finding myself wanting to grab that CD and blast it in the stereo. I love this album now.<br />I still don't hold it such high esteem as I do &quot;Heathen&quot; (or &quot;Black Tie, White Noise&quot; for that matter) but there it is, I love it. 'New Killer Star' and 'Pablo Picasso' are eclectic and exceptionally groovy. Driving around in the car playing those two tracks feels awfully stylish. I haven't yet psychoanalysed the album yet but through the perspective of how it sounds and feels it's tremendous.<br />My one qualm with &quot;Reality&quot; is the placing of track number 4 (of 11 tracks), it's called 'The Lonliest Guy' and is very depressing as one can deduce by the title of the song. Now I find no fault in the depressing song but I feel depressing songs should serve as intro's or outro's to an album. But a simple track skip/program can remedy that anyway.<br />All in all I'd give this album 4 out of 5 stars, &quot;Heathen&quot;, &quot;Black Tie, White Noise&quot; and &quot;Outside&quot; in my opinion are much better than this outing but with that said this album is perfectly acceptable and greatly enjoyable. Highly recommended, especially in a market polluted with so much tripe, it's great to see talent shine through so strongly.<br />-Mr.Deflok (Mayur Gandhi)
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is definitely Radiohead's best album, if not one of the best albums of all time. Overrated? Not at all, in fact it is underrated. This album gets better each time I listen to it, never in any way getting weary of it. The message conveyed through this album is very relevant, as well as acurate. I must say that although there are some people who may not perhaps appreciate this album as much as it deserves to be appreciated, I would assume that no true music-lover could deny that OK Computer truly is musicianship at its best. Any detractors of this album are probably just bandwagon jumpers disappointed in the lack of catchy dance music.
B00003CXIY|4.0|This movie is excellent, silly s it is, and it plays well on repeated viewing. If you thought American Pie was a good movie, you will love this amusing tromp through American with these four crazy college students. It will keep you laughing throughout the entire movie.<br />If only I had taken a road trip like this when I was younger.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I Was Hooked to A Perfcet Circle ever since i hear it for the first time...Mer de Noms Is one om my favorite albums all-time, and 3 libra's is one of my favorite songs ever, even though i'm a devoted incubus fan... So, after a great debut album, all i expected from &quot;a perfect circle&quot; was equal greatness...And they didn't disappoint me...the moment i heard &quot;weak and powerless&quot; i was hooked, and when it finally came out, (today, it is) i was so happy to have it in my hands, even though i have already heard it on the internet... but it's 100 percent woth it to buy the record... I did....and the art is amazing, as well as the lyrics, the music, maynard's voice... amazing...BUY IT now, or you will burn in hell!! lol
B00003CWTI|4.0|TV millionaire Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is on his deathbed dying from cancer, his beautiful wife's (Juilianne Moore) painpill addiction is more than she can handle. All the while, Earl's nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) trys to track down Earl's son, a sex instructor Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), who wants nothing more than to get to watch his old man croak. Whiz-Kid Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is being pushed by his cold hearted dad into breaking the record on the game show What Do Kids Know? Then there is Stanley's predecessor, the grown-up Quiz-Kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) whom has lost his job, lost his pride and has mixed sexual feelings about the bartender. The host of What Do Kids Know?, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), whose dying of cancer trys to reconcile with his cocaine addict of a daughter (Melora Walters) and fails miserably. She is also on a date with a cop (John C. Reilly), who wants to date her, but can't get a signal on whether or not she likes him. But all of them will cross paths, some in tragic ways, but all in redemption for a new look at what tomorrow will bring.<br />\\"Magnolia\\" is a great film with an excellent cast. Director P.T Anderson (Boogie Nights) brings a film with ragged emotions, romantic dreams and generational termoil to a cinematic masterpiece. In a psychological game of pickup sticks we see each generation of parents alienate the next and how, ultimately, they find redemption for the past and a new future. The way P.T. Anderson directs this film is brilliant. An excellent cast with a crafty director shows why this film was nominated at both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. Tom Cruise give a more than Oscar worthy performance. Other notably great performances come from Macy, Moore and Hoffman.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|A Perfect Circle set the bar very high with their debut album, Mer De Noms.  Maybe a bit too high.  For those of you expecting Noms 2, you may be a bit disapointed.<br />This album wants to rock.  It shows potential to rock just like Mer De Noms did.  But in the end, you feel that this album could have given you so much more.  It would be unfair to call this album Tool Jr., but if you judge an album on its first couple of songs, it sounds like just that.  The cd has far too many quiet lulls, and points of contemplation, the things that work so well for Tool.  The only problem is, Tool albums, especially Lateralus, work in movements, building up to its high points and crashing down to its low points.  A Perfect Circle seems to want to use that same formula throughout the CD, but does so with much less success.<br />The songs are far too short in order to pull off that feat.  As soon as it begins to rock, you are abrubply cut off, and brought to a soft tone or wisper.  As soon as songs like &quot;A Stranger&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Outsider&quot; grab a hold of any emotion, it changes gears and tries to envoke a different emotion from you, without fully emancipating the first emotion.  Songs lith &quot;Judith&quot;, &quot;Brena&quot; and &quot;3 Libras&quot; were powerful songs that rieked of guitar work and power chords.  Those signature sounds are somewhat missing from this album.  The &quot;power&quot; tracks sound little like Mer De Noms, but more of a mix between Tool and Failure, whose &quot;Nurse who loved me&quot; track was covered on this CD.  I believe that this weak cover also takes away from the overall cd, especially for fans of Greg Edwards' style power chords.  Their strings-based soft cover of the power chord song is a stark reminder of what power rock should sound like in the lost and ignored years from 1995-2000.<br />This CD, even with its low points, emits a definite air of musicianship and craft.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this is a very good album no matter what.. its an album you must sit and listen to not just skip through songs, it has long songs like tools albums and such.mmuch more melody and talent not as fast as the 1st but it is still very very great.. must buy this!!
0684803356|5.0|I can't say enough how much I like Hemingway and his writing.  The complexities of relationships and the struggle to understand people's loyalities are shown in this book.  Also a refreshing and informitive look at the Spanish Civil War.  Which in my belief is not widely known here in the States.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|this is a good album, but they completely change and IMO butcher Failure's &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;. Now that I think of it, APC is doing nothing that Failure wasnt doing about 5 years ago before they broke up. Get Failues Fantastic Planet, its better than either APC album
B00005JKZV|4.0|OK, so the whole Tolkien purist thing has been done, done, done. INTERPRETATION. ADAPTATION. &quot;Based on.&quot;  You'll live, and if you've got to blame someone, you probably want to blame the money-chasing movie industry.<br />Got it? Good. Let's put this aside for the moment and look at the film, free of the baggage: in many parts it's a lot more engaging than the Fellowship (which seemed more about exposition than anything), but why is this so patchy? There's over 40 minutes of extra stuff on the upcoming extended edition, and its absence in the theatrical release makes itself known.  There's SO much stuff to cram in, and it's hard to absorb without either some more explanation, or by knowing the story beforehand.<br />It was nice to see that very little time was given to rehashing and the scope of the tale was widely expanded, but there are parts of the story that seemed extremely ill-paced and hard to follow: too much plot, not enough time (come to think, this is probably the reason for the much-maligned Arwen thing -- how else are you going to reveal it?).  The equally disputed part where the Elves joined the battle at Helm's Deep seemed to have absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than adding a juicy dramatic death scene to a familiar-but-not-central character.  The Ents were practically forgettable, with the exception of the excellent scene at Isengard -- it was as though the forest-wandering scenes were merely pillows in between bits of action, totally devoid of any other purpose.  The action rolls along nicely, but the end of the film kind of dangles, neither a cliffhanger nor a gentle 'See you next year!'<br />Meanwhile, some of the more interesting characters' development seemed somewhat lacking, again probably attributable to the missing pieces.  A lot more interesting things could have been done with the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli -- short jokes don't cut it, and both characters were otherwise flat.  Elrond's behaviour in the scene with Arwen is, like 'Fellowship,' just a bit more sinister than it really needs to be.  It would have been nice to make the most of Eowyn's character, with a little more time spent on her mettle and royalty, and less on the fawning over Aragorn/helping small kids aspect.<br />Put simply, it feels a bit 'unfinished,' and it's not just the middle-of-the-trilogy syndrome.  I'd be inclined to wait till the Return of the King is released before making any firm judgment, though.<br />The acting is schweeeet, avoiding the two-dimensionality that comes with Big Epics (and yes, Gollum counts as acting).  The cast does a fantastic job despite the lack of attention to their roles' development.  David Wenham in particular does a great job with adding some warmth to an otherwise shallow and unnecessarily nasty Faramir.  Viggo Mortensen continues to stand out, adding all kinds of depth to Aragorn and avoiding the all-too-common Big Epic stock hero routine you tend to get in films like this.  It's also particularly nice to see Elijah Wood doing something other than the 'happy hobbit/scared, bugeyed hobbit' routine.<br />The transfer to DVD is particularly good, with only a small amount of artifacting floating about in the edges of the darker scenes.  The surround audio is outstandingly sharp to my ears, and if you're interested in the English subtitles for the hearing impaired, you'll be pleased to note that it sticks like glue to the spoken dialogue.  The extra DVD's full of the usual interesting peeks into the filming and so forth, and some fun (but typically cable-fluffy) interviews with the cast, producers and Jackson.  Sean Astin's cute short film, The Long and the Short Of It, is entertaining -- but come on, do we need a Making Of for that one? Sheesh.  The game preview looks superb.  The Two Towers footage is simply amazing.<br />I didn't really want this version, preferring to get the extended edition for a more complete film, but my brother (bless him) gave it to me asa gift.  Wait for the extended release if you've become a big fan and really want to get a better idea of Jackson's interpretation, cause my gut says that the missing pieces in the theatre release are contained in those 40 minutes.  But if you're pleased with the film as-is, buy now!
B00005B3Z6|3.0|As much as I did like the British QAF, I have to say I like the American one better, but maybe it's just because I'm American. The sex scenes are more explicit, the actors display much more emotion (they are a fantastic cast), and the plot lines are fleshed out better. It was harder to get really attached to the British series. It seemed a bit rushed, like Russell T. Davies wanted to tell more of a story than the series' short run allowed. Though it did have a very gritty, realistic feel to it, I have to say that it's much harder to buy Aidan Gillen as the sexy guy who can have anyone. He's no comparison to Gale Harold. His character comes off as a bit more selfish, too. Nathan is brattier than Justin, but Vince is more lovable than Michael (Vince comes off as a little less pathetic). But without the courage it took to make the British series and put it on the equivalent of basic cable, there'd be no American QAF. No substitute for ours, but a great watch anyway. Too bad the series didn't last longer.
B00002E285|5.0|This Vidieo is one of the greatest stories ever told. It showes Pink Floyd fans what the wall realy means and it helps vievers undertsnad the wall. The movie is great and if you are looking for a boring movie and you are not a Floyd fan t hsi isn't for you. It helped me under stand the songs and his troubles. I give this movie 5 stars and i am glad i bought it, I would not ever get rid of this movie and i plan to watch it over and over again!
B000000WA4|5.0|As you have probably heard about a million over the yrs, this album is amazing. I'm not going to go on and explain how utterly unbelievable it is, for you all have heard it before. What I will say is that it is my favorite album ever. It is number one on my top 10 favorite album list. <BR>  All the songs are excellent, but some of my personal favorites are: &quot;Jellybelly&quot;, &quot;Stumbleine&quot;, &quot;In The Arms Of Sleep&quot;, &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, and &quot;We Only Come Out At Night&quot;. <BR>  This album is very theatrical, with the first disc being a more upbeat, feel good, rock cd, and the second disc, being a dark, depressing, sad, mellow cd. Both discs are amazing, but my personal favorite is the second disc. <BR>  Go and buy this album. it deserves to be in everyone's collection, no matter what kind of music you are into.
B00003CX95|2.0|The movie has its moments.  Some beautiful photography, impressive sound and sentimentality galore for those in the move.  But in truth it is really a very poor film.  The plot is obvious.  The characters belong in a second rate comic book.  The stereotyping borders on the racist.  It even makes the remarkable Sophie Marceau boring.  Even melodrama should be more engaging.
0385720920|5.0|I'm not going to bother summarizing the novel because that is done above, and frankly, I'm just not very good at summarizing books in the first place. &quot;Choke&quot; by Chuck Palahnuik is one of those books that you read and afterwards you either love it or hate it. You either get it or don't get it. The novel's protagonist is Victor Mancini, probably one of the best anti-heroes I have ever encountered in a book. It's hard not to like him even though he is a despicable character. You can feel the pain that he hides with his overtly apathetic attitude, you can begin to see what made him become what he is. He wants to feel something, anything but admitting that he wants love and to be needed would go against everything he has built his life on.<br />For those of you who like straightforward reads that start from a set point and continue till the end, this book may not be for you. Each short chapter is like a different episode in his current or past life. It is easy to pick up on after the first two or three chapters, so you can go with the flow. Also, this format makes it a quick read...it keeps you moving from page to page.<br />I think the best overall aspect of &quot;Choke&quot; is the characters' insights (especially Victor's) of life. Most often satirical, his views of the society in which we all live are definitely thought-provoking, but he has some touching revelations as well.<br />&quot;Dude!&quot; This is absolutely a good book to check out.
0393316041|5.0|I always thougth that theoretical physicists were these super smart guys sitting around the black board drawing weird diagrams of atom smashing and writing math forumulas that predict that life cannot exist and pondering the meaning of things like gravity and magnetism. Now the truth is out, they are weird, but in an normal sort of insane way. They have these great insights and then spend the rest of their lives banging away at the great unsolvable problems like &quot;what do women want&quot; and &quot;where to find a hotel in city that's full up.&quot;<br />I really liked this book. It brings out the human side of Dr. Feynman. I've read his lectures on physics books and they are dry and full of stuff I've long forgotten. But after reading about his adventures with the California state school system in picking a science text book had me rolling on the ground laughing. As a student I always wondered how these bad textbooks got sent down to torment me and now I know. It surely wasn't Richard's fault!<br />Anyway a good read about the life of one who saw life through a different set of colored glasses.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Honestly, I thought I was a true Beatles fan before I watched this DVD collection... not even close.  These are the most amazing DVD's I own, and believe me, I watch them over and over and over.  The interviews give such an insight into the minds of the Beatles.  The live performances are incredible!  The inside-the-studio audio clips/outtakes are hilarious!  There are not enough praises I can give.  My recommendation: these DVD's are worth every cent.
0393320928|5.0|Dr. Feynman spent a lifetime looking for truth about physics and particularly subatomic particle physics. Then the Challenger disaster happens and he's called on to find the truth in NASA and in politics. He of course handles it superbly and we all know why it blew up. This is that story and its another good read for those who read and liked &quot;Surely You must be joking.&quot;<br />If you haven't read the first book, do it is slightly better and you could read them out of chronological order but you'll wish you hadn't.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|OK, i'll keep mine short and sweet.  Huh? all you people who gave it 4 or 5 stars,.. did you see the same movie as i did? <BR>there was nothing compeling or twisted or, story lines that are hard to grasp. this movie rates right next to meatballs 2 for complexity.  It was an utter waste of time. i agree with the first reviewer, they had all this great technology, but can't make shoes? a love scene.. then do it already..15 freakin minutes...maybbe KR is innt he wrong movie biz.<br />if you want excellent story, for those that get Kubrick's movies, spend your money on LoTR, or 2001 or something with better plot, story, character dev.<br />The problem is they tried to use special effects to tell the story... sorry--doesn't work that way. the story comes first, when someone in hollywood gets it, then we get a  good movie.<br />BTW, 2001 A Space Odessey came out in 1968. the effects and story were much better and solid, with a better evil computer, than Matrix reloaded ever could hope for.<br />Waiting for Return of the King....
B000002GLE|5.0|I've bought live albums from countless different bands before, and I must say that this is probably the best one I've ever heard.  The recording quality is flawless.  Everybody in the 7-piece band sounds great and is mixed very well.  I can't speak for the reissued version though; I only have the original version (which like all older double-disc CDs, came in that bulky, older style type of case).  The liner notes are very well done too.  There are many abstract art paitings of the band members, which look quite striking (albeit a bit \\"80s\\") against the black background.  Sting comments on each song on the album, explaining their meaning and inspirations.    This live album was made in the time after Sting's first solo album, The Dream of the Blue Turtles.  The band includes Sting on lead vocals and 6-string guitar, four musicians that each have a resume to die for (Omar Hakim on drums, Darryl Jones on bass, Kenny Kirkland on keyboard, and Branford Marsalis on sax), plus backup vocals and some percussion provided by Dolette McDonald (who also sang on the The Police's \\"Syncronicity\\" tour) and Janice Pendarvis.    There are a total of 16 songs here, including 3 medleys of 3 songs each.  8 songs are from The Police.  Instead of going after the hits we've all seen on too many compilations, Sting goes for songs that are more obscure, but none the less great.  I'm a die-hard Police fan, and trust me when I say that Sting does NOT butcher these songs -- he digs up these gems and turns them into pieces that sound equally beautiful with a jazz band.  The disc starts off with a long but up-beat medley of \\"Bring On The Night\\" and \\"When The World Is Running Down\\", that just never loses energy.  Sting also reforms \\"Low Life\\" (a former B-side) and brings a new melancholy to \\"I Burn For You\\" (a song from the \\"Brimstone & Treacle\\" soundtrack).  The reggae sound of The Police's \\"One World\\" leads nicely into Sting's \\"Love Is The Seventh Wave\\".  The pure-jazz madness of \\"Dream Of TheBlue Turtles\\" flows into fast guitar-driven \\"Demolition Man\\".  \\"Driven To Tears\\" is given a hip latiny feel, while \\"Tea In The Sahara\\" is given a new fullness with piano, sax, and back-up vocals.    Of the 8 non-Police songs, 5 are from Sting's solo album.  Once again, he doesn't go straight for the hits (\\"If You Love Somebody\\", \\"Fortress Around Your Heart\\", \\"Russians\\"), but rather chooses almost every other song: \\"Love Is The Seventh Wave\\", \\"Consider Me Gone\\", \\"We Work The Black Seam\\", \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\", and \\"Children's Crusade\\".  The live versions don't sound drastically different than the studio version, maybe with the exception of Sting's powerful ending vocals to \\"Bourbon St\\".  But they're all songs that sound just as great live as they did in the studio.  The remaining two songs, which you can't find anywhere else in any form are \\"Down So Long\\" and \\"Another Day\\".  \\"Down So Long\\" is a 12-bar blues jam, which give some of the musicians a little more spotlight.  But \\"Another Day\\" is one of my all-time favorite songs from ANY band!  Very emotional and well-played.  [EDIT: After I wrote this original review back in 2003, I eventually found out that \\"Another Day\\" was another obscure B-side from Sting, from the 7\\" single of \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\\".  I managed to find the 45rpm on eBay.  In my opinion, the live version here is infinitely better than the studio version from the single.]    \\"Bring On The Night\\" is, like the documentary of the same title, a great document of this incredible line-up of musicians.  I only wish more bands had live albums that captured their essence as well as this one.
B00007LTIB|5.0|This is the album that followed the highly ambitious and flawed Tales from Topographic Oceans. T.F.T.O was too wide spred and had so many ideas condensed into an already very lenghty album, it tried to take all the ideas from the highly sucessfull Close to the Edge and expand all the ideas and insert new one. There were many successes and a few faliures.<br />But then came Relayer- to me the monster of all Yes albums. Filled with intelligent angst, thoughtful search for the Truth, and some of the most dynamic playing comparatively to any of the other Yes albums before. Relayer experiments more than any other album, rocks harder, and each song relates superbly to the next.<br />We start with Gates of Delirium, 22 minutes of thoughfulness, chaotic instrumental breaks and observant lyrics all artfully expressing the madness that must be indured in the world to get to a more spiritual place- the manic use of percussion and strange keyboards twisting each note (I wish Moraz would have done more with the group) express chaos quite nicely. This all leads to the final six minutes of Soon, Howe's phased guitar notes trinkling down as Moraz's keyboard washes give such a sense of peace after all the termoil of the first part of the song.<br />Then we have:<br />Sound chaser, high intensity of avante garde jazz starts and stops gets the song going before we go through a mad'ning circular chord sequence the song is a brilliant display of Yes's superior use of time change and intrumental sychronicity. This song is more intense than Gates and the softer parts of the song only lends more to the ferocity of the bands interplay.<br />and finally:<br />there's To Be Over a perfect song to end on. The beginning of the song with guitar layered apon guitar apon keyboards apon more guitar and sitar just is one of the most glorious moment on any of Yes's albums. The beauty of Howe's steel guitar gliding through the melody with Anderson's drifting melody just invokes a lot of peace and the almost country tinge/Asian delicacy of the song makes it a true original.<br />I think that all that Yes's did in the 70's was masterful including the often attacked Tormato, and they rarely repeated themselves which is quite a feat for any artist. I think that Relayer is a peak they reached among many, but this is my personal favorite because it just rocks so hard and it makes those blissful moments just that greater (something i wished Topographic Oceans had done); there is never a dull moment to say the least. I recommend this album to anyone trying to find that instensity of Heart of the Sunrise (Drama is a pretty intense album as well, but not nearly as much as Relayer and Fragile).<br />  As for the newly remastered sound- dyno-mite!  Bonus tracks are fascinating extensions but not nessesary.  Definitely worth an investment.ry tinge/Asian delicacy of the song makes it a true original.<BR>I think that all that Yes's did in the 70's was masterful including the often attacked Tormato, and they rarely repeated themselves which is quite a feat for any artist.

0385504209|3.0|I enjoyed this book and read it in a single sitting.  As page turning adventure with fun puzzles, it's great.<br />However (and with only 3 stars, there must be a however), the book has three very irritating features.<br />The least important, but most cringe-inducing is that Dan Brown gets lots of details, both minor and major, wrong.  For example, GPS doesn't work indoors and most stick shifts don't have a park gear.<br />A more serious flaw in the book is that even if you accept that the Church is founded on a deception foisted upon the world by Constantine, the author's constant polemics demanding a return to the female side of the divine and his blaming of all patriarchal beliefs in all religions on Christianity are distracting and slow the pace of the story.  This might be OK if his digressions were interesting, but they repeat themselves and also fail to address the obvious questions raised about the other cult of Mary (mother of Jesus), which was so strong that when Mohammed accused Christians of Tri-theism he listed Mary as one of their 3 gods.  There are several places in the book where I felt I was being preached at, and I just wanted to get on with the story.<br />My final complaint is that toward the end, I began figuring out the puzzles about 2 pages ahead of the characters (for example, the cipher related to Newton was barely worthy of a crossword clue), which is in the books greatest crime.<br />In all, it is a fun read, but it is far from perfect.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Many will say Elvis is the \\"King of Rock N' Roll\\", but when it comes right down to it, Meat Loaf is THE King of Rock and the genres that we hear today. Bat Out of Hell brings out the best of Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman, because it combines the strongest live and real instruments and creates a rock opera that sends shockwaves through the soul. <br />With the natural epic rock songs like \\"Bat out of Hell\\" and \\"All Reeved up but No place to go\\", its the power ballad songs like \\"You Took the Words right out of my mouth\\" and \\"Two out of Three ain't Bad\\" that make this a truly memorable album. The words Epic, Dynamic, and Powerful can only describe this work of rock art. From the explosive and dramatic instrumentals, the driving voice, to the soulful lyrics, its a power package that simply is the best.<br />Yes people, the world of rock starts here. After you check this out, please be sure to get his other material, and with a new album on the horizon, this could truly be the exclamation point to an amazing comeback and career. This is a must have, check this out!
B0000C23DO|4.0|This is a big improvement over &quot;Skeletons from the Closet&quot;, and a good set for the casual fan. Besides being remastered, this also has 6 more tracks than the old &quot;best of&quot;. This does include the big hits &quot;Truckin'&quot;, &quot;Uncle John's Band&quot;, and &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot;, BUT also has &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;, &quot;Ripple&quot;, and &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;. Obviously many songs are missing like &quot;Scarlet Begonias&quot; and &quot;Throwing Stones&quot;, but it is only one disc. However there is the old 2-disc best of &quot;What a Long Strange Trip it's Been&quot;. Whatever you decide on, play &quot;Dead&quot;.
B000002IU9|5.0|What more to say, this is great from beginning to end.  Smack you in the face riffs and growls that would make a polar bear run for cover and cower into the fetal position. Great first song about Achilles and such.<br />THIS ALBUM F'in ROX!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this has to be the best stuff a perfect circle could never come up with.  Despite their many many changes during tth making of this album with the members of the band.  Maynard gets better as he ages along it's amazing.  Billy howdrel, joadie white, josh freeze, and maynard work so well together.  Troy, and danny lohner are also in some songs before they quit.  Pez was gone before this so shes not in it.  With all these different people working on the same songs.  It still seems like it's almost to perfect.<br />The package-  Is a tool kinda length song, 7:53.  It's a very good song to open up with.  It starts like a jungle song, with african type drums and stuff.  Maynard sings very low, in the middle the temp picks up and maynard sounds almost like a monster.  It's great how it gets low and then heavy, I bet they use so many different insturments on that song.  &quot;clever got me this far, clever got me in.  Take what i came for but im at the door again&quot;  10/10<BR>Weak and Powerless- The first single, a very good song.  One of the upbeat songs kinda.  Very complex song, it's a love song i heard.  &quot;im so weak and powerless over you&quot;  10/10<BR>The noose- A very dark song, I thought it would be upbeat but it's not.  It's like a drug song and killing yourself or something.  Or trying to anyway, but then making amends to the dead.  Very cool background music with maynard and billy singing.  &quot;not to pull your halo down,around your neck and tug you to the ground&quot; 9/10<BR>Blue- Kinda upbeat, another song about depreesion and being blue.  It's a depressing song, but the lyrics are good as always.<BR>&quot;i close my eyes just to look at you&quot;  &quot;just ignore the smoke and smile&quot;  10/10<BR>Vanishing- A very very wierd song, very slow and skin crawling.  About going away from everything.  &quot;disappear, disappear, thiner thinner into the air&quot;  8/10<BR>A stranger-  Very complex lyrics, gutiars control this song.  Kinda slow, but maynards voice is great in this song.  &quot;I listen for the whisper of your sweet insanity&quot;  9.5/10<BR>The outsider-  Reminds me of another part to stranger.  A very upbeat song, Maynard sounds like he did from Aminea (tool) to me.  Crunching type song you could probably headbang to it.  Very meancing song and angery. &quot;everyone one will have their day to die&quot;<BR>Crimes- a instrumental of sorts.  Drumming and some other instruments.  Maynard counts 1-10 and then theres wierd noises.  I won't rate it cuz it doesn't have lyrics.<BR>The nurse who loved me-  A cover song, A very sloooooow song.  A love psycho for like a mental patient.  It will put you to sleep or make you cry ( one or the other)  It's a odd song but the lyrica are good.  &quot;shes got everything i need, Pharmacy keys, she acts just like a nurse to the other guys&quot;  9-10<BR>Pet-  A very crunching type song, then it slows up.  it's kinda like a bed time story.  Talking to a child helping them from the boogyman.  &quot;never mind what other voices say, they don't care about you like I do, like i do&quot;  10/10<BR>Lullaby- Kind of like crimes, but it's like a outro to Pet.  Drumming and wierd noises again.  &quot;lay down go back to sleep&quot;  Won't rate cuz theirs no lyrics not that long.<BR>Gravity-  A very cool song,It's like part 2 of package.  it has the same drumming and similar music.  But's like a depression song,  &quot;im surrending to gravity, catch me as i fall&quot;  I choice to live.  It's reminds me of a drug related song.  Great end song to a great cd. 10-10<br />This album is like a story, all the songs go together well.  They all seem to play a part of each other.  It's a little heavier but in it's own way it's lighter some to.<BR>They don't at all consider this a side project, they take this band seriously you can tell.  Despite all the changes a perfect circle stays a &quot;perfect&quot;<BR>Great album no bad songs, MUST BUY if you like mer de noms.  It's also verydifferent from it.<BR>Howdrel did a good job composing this and the other members well for playing it.  Maynard is aswome as always, so many different tones, high and lows in his voice.
B000002UAR|2.0|Without doubt the most overrated easy listening album of all time.  Taxman has a great bass line, and And Your Bird Can Sing reaches back to the great sound of the early Beatles.  That's it.<BR>The rest is so dated, I can hardly see how this album changed music forever.  The Beatle albums that changed music were the early ones - A Hard Day's Night, Help, etc. <br />Music has made a lot of progress from these orchestra-backed easy listening songs.  In fact, this was almost a step back.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The new album rocks! For fans, the wait is over. Thirteenth Step is the follow up to Mer de Noms, and picks up where the first one left off. It’s more darker, heavier and tighter than its predecessor, but still retained the unconstrained airy studio feel that circumscribe A Perfect Circle. The sound?  Let’s just say the album’s title best describes the music. Thirteenth step is a term for recovering drug addicts. Hard, bitter and heavy but serves to be cathartic in an odd sort of way.
B000002UB3|2.0|I guess I understand how many Beatle fans automatically rate every Beatle album 5 stars, but to the unbiased reviewers, albums like Abbey Road just don't hold up.  There are so many other artists out there who have released consistently better rock music than what is contained here.<br />My recommendation is to focus on the early Beatle albums when the group was leading the pack, not the later albums where they had fallen seriously behind the times.<br />Checkout A Hard Day's Night, or Beatles 1962-1966.
B000088E6D|5.0|While shopping for a book for a school report, I came across the self titled debut album from Canadian export Michael Buble, and bought it completely as an impulse. Later that night, as I listened to it, I realized I should pay attention to my impulses more often. I was blown away, and it automatically became one of the favorites in my collection. Michael's voice is very unique, and resembles astounding characteristics to music great Frank Sinatra, whose charm and classy attitude had audiences amazed for the span of his career. It is not only powered with Michael's sinfully smooth voice, but it has rocking additions such as a back up jazz band, and great mixes of some old time classics, such as &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot; giving them a new age kick. This entire album is great, but some of my favorites have to be &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; and the wonderfully catchy &quot;Moondance&quot;. No one can upstage the original, Mr. Sinatra, but Michael Buble sure makes an amazing comparison. A must have for every old school music lover.
B000002UAU|2.0|There are three really great songs on here - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Sgt. Pepper (reprise), and A Day in the Life.  While this is great, the rest of the album doesn't really rock.<br />If you haven't heard this, don't expect the sound of the early Beatles that made them so popular.  When I'm Sixty Four is like some ragtime number.  Getting Better and Good Morning, well, are being used as commercial jingles now.  Within You Without You is almost universally agreed upon as the weakest point of this album.  Fixing A Hole, Lovely Rita, and the Benefit of Mr. Kite are OK, but kind of mediocre.<br />The summary is that this album starts strong and finishes strong, but there's a huge valley in the middle on tracks 7 &amp; 8  (Mr. Kite and Within You Without You) that is tough to get over.<br />Biased Beatle fans give this 5-stars, which is fine, but it's really a 2 or 3 star album.
037542217X|5.0|This series is one the best I've read in years.  The characters are compelling and Smith's descriptions of Botswana make it all come alive.
0446677450|1.0|I really wanted to like this book but after reading it again and again I find two things: 1) He doesn't tell you any exact steps of what you should be doing in order to be rich 2) He never seems to get to the point. He continues to ramble on about why financial security is important but it basically just stops there. Let me ask you, who out there doesn't want to be rich?. Or be free and independent from the jobs they hate?. I think that's all of us but he's got to deliver better and more concrete action steps than this. Though in truth teaching people to be rich is hard, because everybody wants to make their millions using skills they love to use in the field that they like. Such skills aren't taught anywhere, they come only from experience. All he teaches in here is how to do real estate, which may not be right for the person who wants to get ahead.
B00001ZULV|3.0|Most of these songs are great cuts. The selection leans toward the pop stuff of Genesis, except for a couple of Peter Gabriel led tracks that are out of place. There are a few cuts that were left off that should've been here. I guess with a catalog as extensive as Genesis' it's hard to make a greatest hits collection that isn't a box set. The title of &quot;The Hits&quot; is a little deceiving in this one. I suggest buying all of their CD's, and burning your own favorites CD.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A perfect circle has finally gotten their second album on the shelves and its certainly just as good as mer de noms. Despite new band members, they've maintained theyre quality. Maynard plays around with vocals a bit more in this one; you'll hear note jumps in lyrical singing followed by low grunting characteristic of Aenima. It's impossible not to love Maynard's voice, the use of drums, strings (always excellent when used in rock), and guitars (even when its simple, it just works so well). They ought to have literary analysis books on lyrics because of artists like Maynard. If you're not hooked after the first 30 seconds of the first track, then you have no taste and there's nothing anyone can do for you. To all those who have a true love for music: Buy this album, and enjoy.
0385491026|5.0|Margaret Atwood has a talent for words ~~ and this book is one of the few books written in the English language that makes you want to read more on science and look up the meanings of the words. It is also a morbid look into the darker side of human nature and relationships between little girls and their so-called friends/tormentors. Atwood used an autiobiographical vein throughout this book ~~ drawing you into the life of Elaine, the main character who has never quite feel in place while young. Uprooted by her parents always on the search for her father's science projects, Elaine longed nothing more than to have a best friend. And when she finally has a best friend, her life changes but not necessarily for the better.<br />This is an indepth look at relationships little girls endure while growing up. It is also an indepth into Elaine's mind as she grows up to be a successful painter. Behind that facade of success is a lonely and terrified woman though she hides it well ~~ with a sneer and sharp comebacks to anything anyone says. Throughout the book, she relives her memories of a childhood that is not so special as she had wished for. It shaped her to be this woman that she is ~~ and stripped her dreams to reality.<br />It is an interesting look into women's psyche ~~ I have to admit that it took me awhile to get into the story because it was so dark and more morbid than I recall Atwood ever writing. But she has a flair for drawing readers into her stories. This is definitely one story that I won't forget so easily. It is a genuine Atwood at one of her best.<br />9-15-03
0375422307|5.0|Satrapi has succeeded in creating an excellent children's book with cunning layers of meaning that make it appealing to adults of all ages. The book is illustrated, meaning it resembles a comic, but the art is simplified in a startling way that enhances the overall mood of the book.<br />The book is the story of a dissolving society, told in the perspective of a child that tries to make sense out a world that is split between a mad propaganda which has been fanned by religion, and the clear view of the situation that her intellectual parents possess, which is tempered by their love for their child. It is a believable tale (which is good, since it is a work of non-fiction), and the child's point of view injects a dose of humor, which makes the tale's telling all the more poignant.<br />Even though the tale is heavy, Satrapi succeeds in producing it in an easily digestible bite. I think Persepolis is a marvelous accomplishment, and am very happy that someone with a story to tell like Satrapi is endowed with a talent like Satrapi's.
B00003CXWV|1.0|I just recieved my DVD and the whole thing is scratched and slowed down... what a waste!
B00005JKC3|3.0|Ang Lee is a brilliant director. That being said, I don't think Universal should have handed this movie to him. Comic book movies need to remember from whence they came. They need to remember who their core audience is. This movie does neither. It is an excellent movie. It's just not the movie that it should have been.<br />The movie looks great. Eric Bana seems to be sleepwalking through the better part of the film. Jennifer Connelly does her usual great job. Nick Nolte should join Over-Actors Anonymous. The effects are top-notch. And still, this isn't the Hulk that I wanted to see on the big screen.<br />The old CBS series, much of which is now available on DVD, came closer to the tone that should have been here. A man who is tortured by what he's become on a search to find the cure. This movie makes the same mistake that the \\"Lost in Space\\" movie made. It all boils down to \\"Everything will be alright if only my Dad would love me.\\"<br />The franchise that could have been \\"The Hulk\\" now gives way to this solo movie. Enjoy it for what it is, or for what it could have been.
B00000GAIW|4.0|The song is powerful and has static of its own. The first time I heard it I couldn't believe it was actually Jethro Tull till I heard the flute solo. Magnificent, that solo makes my teeth screech.
B00005JLXE|4.0|There are several reasons why this movie is such fun. Unfortunately, none of them is named Affleck. Everytime I hear him listed as an Academy Award winner, I wish they had to say that it wasn't for his acting abilities.<br />Jennifer Garner as Electra is perfect. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is right on target (sorry, couldn't resist). The effects work is first rate.<br />This is the epitome of a popcorn movie. Just sit back, relax and enjoy it for what it is. As a translation of a comic to screen, it stands up fairly well. Unfortunately, the only thing that didn't translate from that two-dimensional world was Ben Affleck. The rest of the movie is exceptional.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Finally!! I was so excited to get this CD. I have to say I'm very impressed with the results. This album continues on an interesting path from Mer de Noms - each song containing that ethereal quality I love, along with some fascinating new sounds. The music is poignant, but oh, so powerful! Incredible lyrics/songwriting, and Maynard's vocals are exceptional, as always, drawing from his softer, more sensual side. There's something about A Perfect Circle that reaches under the skin, and haunts you long after you've stopped listening to it (if you can)! Overall, in my humble opinion, I think it's a spectacular addition to APC's Catalog.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The Superman mythos has gone through many variations in it's life. From comic books, to movies, to television series. This series removes one element, the blue suit. That, and adding a dash of teenage angst make it fun.<br />Tom Welling as the Man-of-Steel-to-be gives a great performance as young Clark Kent. Annette O'Toole (Superman III) and John Schnider (The Dukes of Hazzard) add a nice touch as Ma and Pa Kent. Though Pa needed to lighten up considerably in the first season. An issue that was adequately addressed in the early second season.<br />The supporting cast, especially Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, deserve the lion's share of the credit here as well. Without a strong supporting cast, this show could easily fall on it's face.<br />While the first season tended to lean a bit heavily on the \\"Kryptonite-created Villian of the Week\\", it's a fun ride. And, the producers have obviously had fun throwing in some touches... like having Clark wear a blue t-shirt under his favorite red coat... or the original Smallville High emblem (an \\"S\\" in a shield) worn by everyone but Clark.<br />All in all, an excellent show from the WB.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|the band has minor member changes with james iha from smashing pumpkins and twiggy ramirez from marilyn manson, but its not like they have any say on the music anyway. the vocals seem less graceful than APC first album maynard does alot of raspy lines that sound really similar to Tool's undertow, i personally like the more graceful aproach. the guitar lines are good but they are starting to sound all the same two albums in and almost no change in the mood.they've took a mellow aproach to this album which is awesome and i figure once i listen to it a couple more times it will grow on me just like their first album.i'm guessing their stage show will still be great and i'm stoked that ill get to see them live again.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie gave you exactly what you wanted. To revisit the characters that you discovered in the first movie. They built this sequel in the precise way that it should have been built. They started with the characters and went from there. So many sequels are just concerned with being \\"bigger,\\" they never consider that better would be the best way to go.<br />The story focuses on Logan (Wolverine), and the search for who he is. A nice carry over from the first movie. Along the way, we meet new friends and enemies. Not all of whom are what they seem to be.<br />Apparently, we're to believe that Mystique has been able to keep the impression of Senator Kelly going since we last left them. Hey, minor issue as far as I'm concerned.<br />The effects work is again top-notch. The cast makes you believe that this world of mutants could actually exsist. Director Bryan Singer has once again put together a thoroughly enjoyable movie which is arguably better than the first.
B00008LDPU|4.0|In one word, fascinating.  This collection of shorts is the main thing that got me really interested in The Matrix.  Before this, all The Matrix was to me was a great movie that made me think, with a poor follow-up that didn't.  Yet these animations did more than make me think, they made me scared.<br />The basic premise of the Matrix should seem at equal times far-fetched and possible.  Machines taking over has always been a classic.  But The Second Renaissance I&amp;II took that classic plot several steps further.<br />Needless to say, Second Renaissance was my favorite.  The way that it showed the horrors that mankind can commit, and the graphic nature that it showed them in made me both horrified and mesmerized at the same time.  And if anybody feels that such things are fantasy and could not happen, then what is going on in the parts of the world that you don't want to live in?  I'm talking about the Balkans, or wherever in the world there is such a thing as ETHNIC CLEANSING.  That's basically what Second Renaissance was depicting, just taken to the extreme.  Humanity attempted to commit mass genocide in this world.  And I truly believe that such a thing is entirely possible.  Machine bodies being dumped into the water by the thousand is a movie image that will stay with me for a long time.  As well as the machines being executed, run over by tanks, etc.<br />Anyway, enough of that tirade.  The rest of the shorts were excellent also.  Some were questionable, which keeps me from giving a full 5 rating to The Animatrix, but most were exceptional.  I particularly also liked World Record, which had an amazing message for any athlete who has experienced &quot;The Zone&quot;; Last Flight, mainly because I had to keep reminding myself that it was animation; and Kid's Story, due to the VERY different animation.<br />Definately get this DVD, and if you can't get it, then watch it somehow.  It is worth your time.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The CD is a little different from Mer De Noms, but is good nonetheless.  <br />COMPUTER WARNING<br />The only thing I would complain about is that the CD has some sort of copy protection on it that blocked my computer's access to it.  I had to play it through Windows Media Player and rip it to .wma format.
B00KE3B6NI|4.0|The old dvd I have is so grainy that I couldn't stand to watch the movie.  Criterion has made the picture clean, but not as crisp as my better Blu-rays.  Definitely, a good picture but I wouldn't rate it 5/5, of course this could be due to the source film they used.  The audio is only a 3.0 which means there are no back channels, no subwoofer response, and, in this case, most of the movie sounds like a really center heavy mono broadcast.  I wouldn't say Criterian nailed it here.  The extras are great and loaded.  I thank Criterion for making one of my favorite movies watchable again and loading it with extras; however while the movie is a 5/5, the sound and video for this blu-ray are a little short of the 5 spot.
0385504209|5.0|A cryptic nailbitting masterpiece of the thriller genre - Dale Brown's words electrifies our interest and holds us to the very last word...a late night burner of a read.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This probably is one of my favorite albums of all time too.  The sound and the way it was all put together is just incredible.  I also like At the Drive-in and Sparta as well, but I think The Mars Volta is the best thing to come out of this circle of musicians.  I highly recommend this album.  It is a shame that Jeremy Ward (sound manipulator) died.  Hopefully they can find a adequate replacement and make another album like this one.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I own this an all of his American Recordings albums. Each one is simply breathtaking and I'll be listening to them for years to come. His cover version of NIN's &quot;Hurt&quot; on this album and it's accompanying video leaves me speechless. His passing almost brought tears to my eyes....we miss you Johnny Cash....
0385504209|2.0|This bestseller by Dan Brown has Professor Robert Langdon and policewoman Sophie Noveau solving one puzzle after another in search of the answer to a great mystery that has been kept through the ages by people like leonardo Da Vinci and Victor Hugo.  This novel reads like a text book, with poor characterization and tons of encyclopedia-like explanations of art and symbols.<br />Brown blurs fact and fiction into a jumbled mess that ultimately strikes at the heart of the Catholic and Christian church.  I don't know if its sacreligious because it is a novel and it does pay token acknowledgement to traditional Christian beliefs.<br />The book's is its easy acceptance of the dark secret that the Da Vinci code supposedly hides.  If that secret were so obviously true, it would be known by now.  With just a few minutes of research on the internet, you can discover that most of Brown's premises are faulty.  This would normally be okay in a fiction novel, but Brown does little to distinguish this book from a long narration on the history of art and symbols.
B00006RU5B|4.0|We've spent 10 years in the shadow of pseudo rock, called grunge/alternative.  Finally, some serious heavyweights in the form of Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine (minus Zack) have grabbed the torch.<br />There sound is best captured in tracks such as Set it Off, Gasoline, and Cochise.  These are bone crunching tracks with soaring vocals and wailing guitars.
0887307280|2.0|Gerber has a few good ideas but the book seems to be written by a guy who had some kind of quasi-religious experience that he's applied to business, and a lot of it comes out sounding like psuedo-Zen hooey to me. I don't want to give the book away, and he does have a few good ideas, but they're not as applicable as he'd like. One objection I do have is this: his view of a business is that it is a means to an end, basically to generate sufficient cash so you can live the life you want as an absentee owner. But what if you want a business where you enjoy the work? For example, I enjoy programming computers, though I tend to get sick of clients. I don't want to write an operations manual so others can do my job, I want to have salespeople get jobs for me. Nowhere does he pose such a situation. And he meanders a lot. But he does have some good ideas and I can believe that for some people his basic ideas will be right on the money. For example, I have 2 brothes who are self-employed. According to Gerber, they don't own their businesses, they own their jobs. The minute they stop working, the income stops, something Gerber says is what you should develop your business beyond. Well, I've said enough. Gerber meanders a lot and seems to contradict himself on occassion. He also seems to write as if he wishes he had an MBA or was a famous futurist like Toffler. But for the fledgling business owner, his insights are a good starting point.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|well first off i was awiting this album for some time. after hearing the single &quot;weak and powerless&quot; i was content for some point, but also worried that the new album would lack in certin areas. thirteenth step is a very good album, but not great. it does lack in 1 major thing in my opinion.the intro tracks, criminal, and lullaby. they are really not needed, and sort of take away from the overall efect of the album. too many bands think that we need to be sent a intro to lead in to the next song, while this works for some bands. it does not work for a perfect circle. on the upside, thirteenth step is a lush and beautifuly poetic endevor. maynard's vocals are top notch and the music rocks in that unfimilliar way. it all feels like being in a mad scientists labratory mixing chemicals, but there is never realy any experments that go haywire. i believe that a perfect circle were staying just inside the lines of the coloring book. there is an urgency in wanting to scribble, but it just never happens. i have a feeling that from the liner notes that this was a tribute to life. look in the sleeve you will see what i mean. the top tracks on here are, the outsider, the nurse who loved me, pet, gravity. it seemed like everything came togeather for these tracks, the rest are fantastic but these spill the beans. i give it 4 1/2 stars. mer der noms is 4 3/4. buy both of these, they are rad.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time on televison I was saddend that I didn't catch it in theaters when it was out.  It's an intelligent movie and it's not just about a bunch of guys wailing on each other just for the sake of fighting.  It's got a great director, great cast, great acting and a great storyline.  As soon as the dvd hit the shelves I went out and got my copy.  The plot of this movie is easy to understand (for most people) but hard to put into only 1000 words and I know my review will not do the film justice but I will try my best.    <br />Edward Nortons character \\"Jack\\" works for a major car company writing up reports about car accidents (that might have been caused by the manufacturer he works for) so his boss's can decide if a recall is needed on the automobile.  If the recall is more expensive then paying off the soon-to-be victims families, they don't do one.  He lives a dull, mundane life (like many of us) at his 9 to 5 cubicle and middle class apartment.    <br />He suffers from insomnia and asks his doctor for anything that well help him, claiming he is in pain.  The doctor suggest that if Jack wants to see people in pain he should go to a support group for men dealing with testicular cancer.  Jack goes to the meetings pretending he's sick and in them finds freedom and starts to cry, for him losing all hope was freedom.  Now that Jack can cry, Jack can sleep.  He goes to his testicular cancer mettings and on the way he drops by tuberculosis meetings, blood parasite meetings, sickle cell, lymphoma, bowel cancer, and so on and so forth.  This is his vacation, this is his addiction.    <br />Then one day at his testicular cancer meeting he sees Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), and she ruins it for him.  He's seen her at his other meetings knowing that she suffers from nothing, (same as him) and he can't cry if there is another faker around.  He can't cry so there fore he can't sleep, so he confronts her.  They tell one another they'll expose each other as frauds and then decide to split up the meetings.    <br />On one of Jacks flights back from an accident he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  He and Tyler talk about work, the exit procedure on the plane and how to make napalm from gasoline and orange juice concentrate (is it possible, I doubt it).  Tyler makes and sells soap for a living and gives Jack his business card.  Jack and Tyler part ways, then when Jack gets back to his apartment he notices something different about it, its been blown up.  He doesn't know why but he calls Tyler.  <br />They meet at a bar and after a few pitchers of beer Jack apprehensivly asks Tyler if he could stay with him.  Tyler says yes on one condition, he wants Jack to hit him as hard as he can.  This is were we get to know more about Tyler Durden.    As Tyler and Jack fight, they also bond.  Jack moves in with Tyler and they live together in a dilapidated house in the warehouse district of town.  Every weekend they go to the parking lot of the bar and they fight while on-lookers either join in or watch.  And that's how Fight Club is born.    <br />They move the club to the basement of the bar and that's were they have their weekly fights.  The group gets bigger every week as more people join.  Tyler gives his weekly sermon about our life and our jobs.  How we were thought to believe growing up that one day we would be rich and famous and happy.  How were a generation of men raised by women.  That \\"our fathers were our models for god, if our fathers bailed what does that tell you about god? You have to consider the possibility that god does not like you, he never wanted you, in all probability he hates you\\".    <br />Fight Club gets bigger and Tyler gets an army.  Tyler is nihilistic and he sends his army to run some errands, from blowing up computer stores to destroying corperate art and coffe chaines to bashing in the new VW Bug.  He is also sleeping with Marla after saving her from commiting suicide.  Jack hates Marla so he's not to happy about that.    <br />Tyler has changed Fight Club to Project: Mayhem.  There mission is basicly to destroy corperate america.  Jack had been left out of Project: Mayhem but by the time he finds out about their plans, Tyler has disppeared.  Jack travles around the country looking for Tyler knowing were to go only by the ticket stubs he left behind.  Tylers been busy creating Fight Clubs around the country.  When Jack finally catchs up with him, he is shocked to find out the truth behind everthing.    <br />Now there were a few things I left out like Bob (played by Meatloaf) or who blew up Jacks place but you'll find out about all that when you see the movie.  I suggest if your not to religous or don't mind violence then go out and get the 2-disc dvd.  The movie is no more or less violent then \\"Rocky\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"The Matrix\\" or any other movie with violence in it out there.  The 2-disc has more features and commentaries from almost everyone involved including the writer of the book Chuck Palahniuk.    <br />And for those who said the ending reminded them about what happened in NYC, you have to remember that this movie was made in 1999, two years before.  They tried to make the vans under the buildings into .... rent-a-car vans to remind people of what happened to the TWC in '92 but the people at .....wouldn't give the ok. They thought it was in bad taste.
B00005JLXE|5.0|The above words were spoken by Ben Affleck in this, one of his newest releases-Daredevil.<br />Daredevil is yet another superhero film that is sure to win the approval of it's viewers. Unlike most superhero films, this movie is about a boy who learns how to deal with the world around him after tragicly losing his sight due to an explosion of dangerous chemicals.Why is it any different than other superhero films? Because he didn't feel sorry for himself, but decided to help those who were in need.<br />As for this version(widescreen edition) I would reccomend it because as you know, widescreen allows you to see more of the movie than fullscreen does and this is a movie you definatly want to see all you can.
B000067J1Y|5.0|Hot Shots! is a great movie with a great script and great acting by Charlie Sheen.  Sheen is a great comedy actor and this movie proves it.  This movie came out the same summer as one of the Naked Gun movies, and it spoofs Top Gun perfectly.  Lloyd Bridges is also great as an absent minded General.  Valarie Golino is great in this movie too.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Another must-have Disney special edition...there are enough bonus features here to keep you busy for days.  I really liked the \\"virtual safari\\", where Timon & Pumba guide you thru the jungle by jeep or boat.  You also get an insider's look at the making of a modern animated classic.  The whole package is just very classy, with all-new animated menus and interactive features.<br />There's also a newly-added scene incorporated into the film, a new musical number called \\"The Morning Report.\\"  While this is an enjoyable addition, it doesn't really add anything new to the film.<br />As expected, the picture and sound quality are exceptional; you'll really get swept up into the picture during the more action-filled moments.<br />You simply must own this beloved Disney film, an this 2-disc set is likely to be a highlight of your home video collection.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|John Williams -- The Greatest Hits 1969-1999, as its title proclaims, is a two-disc anthology of one of Hollywood's most famous and prolific composers.  Starting from 1969's \\"The Reivers\\" and ending with 1999's \\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,\\" its 28 tracks cover most of Williams' film scoring career, with two Summer Olympics' (1984 and 1996) fanfares thrown in for good measure.<br />Disc One covers the period between 1969 and 1989, even though the tracks are not arranged in chronological order.  Instead, the fun begins with Williams' most famous (and maybe most popular) piece, \\"Main Title from Star Wars.\\"  It's in this disc that works from his most prolific period appear, including themes from Sugarland Express, Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, E.T., Empire of the Sun, and the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies.<br />Although most of these tracks appear in other John Williams albums, I discovered one new gem in the Main Title from The Reivers (1969). I've never seen the film or read the Steinbeck novel of the same name, but I was captivated by John Williams' way of introducing a melodic idea with a solo instrument (a guitar), then adding an Aaron Copland-like flourish of brass and strings, followed by a series of variations on a theme evoking open spaces and fun hijinks out in the countryside (indicated by the use of banjos and horns).<br />Another surprise on Disc One is the new arrangement of the 1984 Olympic Fanfare, commissioned for the Los Angeles Summer Games.  This reworking of the fanfare adds the familiar \\"Bugler's Dream\\" everyone associates with the Olympics to Williams' vibrant march.<br />Disc Two covers the 1990s (with the peculiar appearance of Williams' \\"March from 1941,\\" Steven Spielberg's 1979 comedy dud). Although Spielberg is the director whose movies have more representation with five of 14 tracks on this disc -- 1941, Hook, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan -- there is plenty of variety, both musically and genre-wise.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Here's my breakdown of this album:<br />Airbag - A little rough, A little smooth, all in all a great song.<br />Paranoid Android - Great Melody with complimeting Lyrics and Guitar Soloing, once again, a great song.<br />Subterranean Homesick Alien - I love the vocals in this song, well performed.<br />Exit Music (For A Film) - Much like a combo of various songs off <BR>of The Wall, it pull's of very well.<br />Let Down - Very smooth song that flow's well with the album<br />Karma Police - Quite Possibly one of my favorite songs, everything in this song compliment's each other, flow's very well with the album.<br />Fitter Happier - An intro to the next track, still, a creative way to do it, once again, you can hear root's of the band Pink Floyd in this track.<br />Electioneering - Awsome guitar riff, great vocals, great lyrics, an excelent song.<br />Climbing Up The Walls - A Chilling sound to this track, very orignal, not my favorite, but still a good track.<br />No Suprises - Soothing and flow's well with the album<br />Lucky - once again a song that flow's extremely well<br />The Tourist - The ending track, wrap's up the album well, all in all a great album.<br />One thing about this CD, try to think of it as one long song, instead of 12 songs (much like the way you'd listen to Dark Side of the Moon), this was my first exposure to Radiohead, being a fan of Pink Floyd, I can honestly say that just about any Floyd fan will like this album, so I highly reccomend this album.
B00009MGQL|1.0|I have been a Jeff beck fan for over 20 years and really enjoy his music. However this latest album just is not for me. The music style has changed into something more like my sixteen year old son listens to - lots of noise and little in the way of music. And the vocals on some tracks don't add anything either.<br />Listen to it if you can before buying and hoepfully you will avoid being really disappointed.
0060977493|5.0|Things don't happen overnight.  They accumulate over time building momentum until an invicible hand unleashes time's work &amp; changes everyone's lives.  Unfortunate lives which seemed to have already been written down in History, predetermined by fate &amp; brought to a denouement by the actions of two people who dared cross the boundary set by society. The caste system like law dictates who should be loved, how &amp; how much.<br />I felt like being led by Roy in a time machine, visiting the Kochama's in different time frames, giving an insight on why they have become what they were.  Baby with her unrequited Mulligan love life, Mamachi with her Papachi-caused moon craters in her head, Chacko losing a daughter holding a thimble for luck, Margaret living in a Joe-less &amp; Sophie Mol-less universe, Ammu searching for tranquility beyond her Ayemenem river, &amp; the fraternal twins constantly seeking acceptance, approval &amp; love - Rahel in her Love-in-tokyo fountainhead &amp; Esta in his beige pointed Elvis shoes.  The Kochama's grieving, scheming with &amp; against each other...all victims of their own fates.<br />The manner the story has been told (present-past-present-past)combined with its unique choice of words (Ammu told Rahel to stop it &amp; so she stoppited) enhanced the story's plot &amp; overall character.  I am certain Roy's poignant novel will touch everone's heart as it did mine.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is not only a great follow up but it makes Mer De Noms look dismal. I was initially dissappointed by their lead single &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; just because it didn't have that punch to it like &quot;Judith&quot; or &quot;3 Libras&quot;. Yet when I had the honor of going to one of their shows and hearing &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Pet&quot; I was blown away by first listen.<br />Vocally and lyrically, what hasn't Maynard James Keenan done? From high pitched screams of &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; to the soothing vocals of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; he's done it all or at least I thought so. I think his main highlight on this album is on the song &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;. Maynard chooses a very unique soothing vocal for the track and it comes off just brillantly. And lyrically, he is nothing short of genius. He states, &quot;Clever got me this far, tricky got me in&quot; and to say it got him far is a huge understatement.<br />Musically this album is a much darker yet much more beautiful presence if theres such a thing. &quot;The Package&quot; is a very unique way to kick off the album with a 7 and 1/2 minute moody epic. &quot;Pet&quot; is very creeping song that matches Maynard nightmarish lyrics and they mesh it together so well. Twiggy (acquired from Marilyn Manson) shows his talent and really outstages Pat from Mer de Noms. Billy Howerdel and Josh Freese are both on the top of their games, and it shows through and through on the record.<br />With a slew of great rock records this year (Radiohead, The Mars Volta, Opeth's Damnation), so far I'd have to say that APC still pulls away with record of the year. As Maynard has said time and time again, this is not a side project and he proves through his effort and his band's that they are one of the best rock bands today.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I wholeheartedy agree with the review written by Daniel Wahl.  This was horrible!  A musical?  Give me a break!!  But then most of the award winning so-called movies these days are garbage, which is why I've taken to watching the old &quot;classics&quot; of late.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Apparently, the movie is not for the easily offended.  But having seen it four times now, I'd say it is very entertaining, and watchable.  I think it is even works as great historical fiction-doesn't everything you read about Chicago in that era tell you that murder was a pastime back then?  That morals were &quot;degrading&quot;?  Cool symoblism (the tap dance in the courtroom scene, for example) and fuel for discussion on the American character, media, and choice of idols.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|... are the only words I could sum up when I first popped in this CD. I have never been a fan of Tool at all, I feel they are overrated and boring (yes, i did just say that), but putting that aside i decided to give APC's sophomore effort a try when I was browsing through CD's today. Having missed their debut album, I wasn't quite sure what my expectations of this band would be. I can't stand Tool, but I can stand this. I have a greater respect for Maynard now than i ever did. His vocals are simply amazing. Very soothing and unlike anything I've heard when he's with Tool. I would have never thought he would be able to pull these vocals off. The music is flowing and passionate, something that seems to be decedantly absent in most hard rock releases these days. You could be relaxed one minute, the next you're spell-bound in mellow aggressive riffs. These guys sound nothing like Tool, and if you think they do you're wrong. If they did sound like Tool, I wouldn't like it. But this CD was well worth the money spent. Having hearing the whole CD twice through now I'm anxious to pick up Mer de Noms very soon. If you want a real musical treat then I suggest you pick this CD up. If you want the same old recycled [material] then stick with your preppy Trapt and Simple Plan. This will not be for everybody I must warn, but those who appreciate good, well thought out melodic music will keep this in their discman for quite awhile. OI!
B00009V7T2|5.0|It is rare that I give an album 5 stars, but this one delivers and deserves every bit of that rating.  Emotional, hooks-laden, and still juxatoposed enough to remain interesting throughout.  One of the top 5 albums in my collection.  Rivals Husker Du's Zen Arcade with better production and less filler.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|PURE ERYKAH. After my first listen, i'm pleased! A huge erykah fan, me like everyone else has been dying for this since Love of My Life last year. My one dissapointment for this release is that the single does not completly find it's way on the album, but a reworking remix of sorts featuring queen latifah and angie stone provides funky satisfaction. The rest of the album is pure erykah but unlike any of her other releases, it's more sounds beats and grooves, pure soul going off and doing her thing. all i can say is listen and crank it up, cause if you love this lady, you will love this collection! i've seen this woman in concert and this album takes off where the studio's and live album left off. mad love for badu!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album kicks it and i was up at the crack of dawn to get it.  Weak and Powerless is a fantastic song.  Also try out the new album Underworld, the song REV 22:20 feat. Keenan and its a beautiful song!
B000056VJ7|5.0|BAT OUT OF HELL is a great rock opera by Meat Loaf, with Jim Steinman writing and Todd Rundgren producing. The three, working with a band built around the members of Rundgren's band Utopia, have crafted a sound that's a blend of Billy Joel, Ted Nugent, and Springsteen, to create a rock opera for the late 70s. It's much better than The Who's TOMMY because its lyrics are totally about a normal adolescence, without any of the spiritualistic questioning and messianic overtones of TOMMY. The remastered version is even better than the original, with two live bonus cuts. I was five years old when the original version came out, so I discovered it as a young adult, and have loved it ever since. Anyone who ever had a true adolescence, with all of its angst and joys, will be able to relate to this  <br />CD.
B00007FOMP|5.0|The reviewer below must have lived in a different universe than the one I did. Marvin Gaye was not killing 'soul'; pop record producers, and , yes, Berry Gordy was in on it, were doing that just fine. Marvin was sick and tired of the commercial 3 minute- 30 second pop venue, plus his tastes were changing, along with the world's. This album can not be described under any genre. It was not funk, and it was not what was being packaged as 'soul' at the time. It was...well, it was Marvin's honest statements about the world he saw, his own problems dealing, and a plea to God to 'let it be OK' - even though he knew deep down that it was \\"destined to die\\". This is not an easy album to listen to, once you get past the hits and the tremendous GROOVE laid down by the famous 'Funk Brothers' (who all cite this as one of their favorite projects). Marvin tells it straight, about his own troubles \\"Flyin' High\\" - and about his uneasiness about Humanity's willingness to make the world a better place. His final plea, \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" is a lovely tune that belies it's deep and troubling message. Very audible in the \\"Remastered' CD are Marvin's whispered prayers all throughout the song. Perhaps the one tune that can be called a funk tune still has great social import - \\"Inner City Blues...\\". This is as good as it gets, this one. Now - the banal \\"Sexual Healing\\", \\"Let's Get It On\\" Marvin, you can take to task for selling soul out...but not this one.

Anecdotal, motivational, and instructional, ON WRITING provides an entertaining, thought-provoking glimpse into the life of one of our most popular, prolific writers.

B000089RVX|3.0|I love Evanescence as a band...Amy Lee is such a sweetie and her voice is simply amazing...just as great as Christina Aguilera's in a different way.<BR>This album doesn't do her justice.  Sure there are a lot of good songs, but not many and not spectacluar.  <BR>Which are good?<br />Bring Me To Life - Of course it's good.  I loved it when I first heard it.  So fresh and new and different...awesome.<br />Going Under - The best song on th album.  Might outdo Bring Me To Life.  This song is just awesome.<br />My Immortal - If you want something soothing and relaxing, listen to this.  Amy Lee's voice is so...distinct and powerful in this song.  Like another reviewer said, it sent chills up my spine.  Especially when she sings &quot;But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along&quot;.  Whoo, powerful stuff.<br />Whisper - The 4th best song.  Nothing great, but definitly should be listened to.<br />The rest of the songs to me are just kinda &quot;blah&quot;.  Perhaps I hafta listen to them more, but they just seem to all sound alike too much.  No offence to fans or the band themselves-they are very talented and awesome.<br />Worth buying the CD?  Yes, definitly.
B000002G7E|4.0|Okay, a lot of people mock this recording. <BR>I like of it though. It was my first VU record i bought, and i liked of what i heard.<br />At the era this record this record was made (1969), no-one really went this black. <BR>Yeah, they can't maybe play that good, but it's all in the attitude and harshness of the music. <BR>It's really dark music in it's way. It tells of the darkest areas of the human mind, with pure aggression and noise. <br />If you don't like amateurish sounding lo-fi pre-punk music as this is, don't buy it. It's a rough ride, and certainly not for all tastes.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have to admit, I'm a little aprehensive about picking up albums based on radio singles. However, Mer de Noms was definitely a great album overall, not just with a good couple of tracks (Judith, 3 Libras, The Hollow), so I chanced it with Thirteenth Step and \\"Weak And Powerless,\\" and I truly feel I pulled in a great return on my investment.<br />Danny Lohner of Nine Inch Nails, recently of Underworld Soundtrack fame, was in to help Billy Howerdel and Maynard James Keenan on the production of the album. So what do you get with an all-star production team and an all-star cast? One damn good album.<br />The Package, track no. 1, sucks you into its eerie sound at its beginning and proceeds to tear you apart at the end with Howerdel's amazing guitar riffs. From there, the darkness of the Thirteenth Step, which I think is a concept album about recovering from...well, recovery (13th step of the 12 step program), is enough to keep you interested. The addition of perfected vocals, guitars, and percussion are what keeps you GLUED to the sound system.<br />The Thirteenth Step is by far the best rock album of the year thus far. I highly recommend picking it up.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|if this album were a stand-alone, it would seem much better than if compared to rage's two former releases(which it constantly is)But when you focus on just this album, it really is excellent- tracks like testify, calm like a bomb, and new millenium homes stand out as tight funk metal, while others such as born of a broken man, maria, and voice of the voiceless flow together more. The lyrics are more concentrated(maria) than their debut's flailing rebellious mantras, which may or may not be good. And tim, tom and brad are excellent as usual, with tom expanding his usual solos (calm like a bomb) and tim adding some solos of his own. Brad drums furiously, holding together the rest of the band with primal fury. This is one of the best albums of 1999.

B00005OM4N|1.0|please don't waste your money on this junk.  this is not music, nor is is singing. it's britney moaning like a frog with an overwhelming amount of machine support.<BR>go get yourself some real music like Rancid, Mest, or even Good Charlotte.  Anything is better than this!
B00006M183|5.0|It seems Pearl Jam gets better and better with each album, and this one is no exception. Riot Act is a more-than-solid album and is one of the best of 2002. The album opens with &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, and it only gets better from there. &quot;Save You&quot;, &quot;Bushleaguer&quot;, &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, and &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; are the best tracks on the album. Other standout tracks include &quot;You Are&quot;, &quot;1/2 Full&quot;, and &quot;Cropduster&quot;. This is Pearl Jam's best album since Vitalogy, though I liked No Code, Yield and Binaural as well. Overall, an amazing effort from the greatest Modern-day rock band that shouln't be overlooked and is definitley worth listening to.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever made.  I've listened to it thousands of times and i still love every second of this album.  For everyone who doesn't have it needs it and for everyone who does it have it then your life is complete.  The beatles are the best band ever and no one will ever be able to make an album like they did ever again.
B000021YQV|4.0|Talented band, but people focus too much on what kind of music it is, or what other bands it sounds like. when you look at the songs, they are insightful, extreme, emotional, and tight. This band knows what they're doing, which could be a result of massive amounts of touring, and rick rubin's help. ( but not too much) Yes this album does have &quot;hip-hop&quot; influences, but it also has some excellent guitarwork, and their extra touches of armenian music, especially at the end after aerials (what? what is that anyway?) anywho, the best tracks or at least the ones you should look for are forest, chop suey, and X. goojahb.
0385512104|3.0|Christopher Boone is this novels 15 year old narrator.  He lives in a modest home in an average neighborhood but for him the world can be confusing.  What makes Christopher unique is that he is autistic.  We the reader see the world through his eyes.  Upon discovering the neighbors dog has been killed, a pitchfork put through its body, Christopher decides to solve the mystery and record this in his book.  We meet his father, a struggling man, who is trying to cope with his son's disablilites, the neighbors, Christophers teachers at his school and various &quot;strangers&quot; that he meets throughout the story.  As the novel progresses we see increasingly the logic that Christopher uses to interpret the world and how this can comfort and at the same time imprison him.  For example, if he sees three yellow cars on the way to school it is a bad day and if he sees three red cars it is a good day.  His reasoning is based on a somewhat skewed perception of information and the reader is able to see the process he uses to come to his conclusions.  It is here that the author Haddon excels in his work bringing the reader into this boys world without making it melodramtic or overly simplistic.  In Christopher's world there is a rationale behind everything he says and does although this may be hard for the person he is interacting with to understand.  This is a book that starts out as a mystery and unravels more than who killed Wellington the dog.  It shows the reader the working of a mind that is different but none the less precious and unique in its own way.
0060012218|5.0|Russel Middlebrook- High School student, nerdy, gay.<BR>Kevin Land- High School student, popular, gay.<BR>Min- Friend to Russel, nerdy, bisexual.<BR>Gunnar- Friend to Min and Russel, straight.<br />Those are the some of the main characters in one of my new favorite books, Geography Club by Brent Hartinger. As you can see, there may be some slight conflicts between characters for various reasons.<br />Excerpt- <BR>'I was deep behind enemy lines, in the very heart of the opposing camp. My advisaries were all around me. For the time being, my disguise was holding, but i still felt exposed, naked, as if my secret was obvious to anyone who took the time to look. I knew that any wrong action, however slight, could expose my deception, and reval my true identity. The thought made my skin prickle. The enemy would not take kindly to my infiltration of their ranks, especially not here, in their inner sanctum.<BR>     Then, Kevin Land leaned over the wooden bench behind my locker and said, \\"Yo Middlebrook, let me use your shampoo!\\"'<br />The entire book is in Russel's point of veiw, a very interesting one at that. I would reccomend this book to anyone, because it is interesting, well written and it is the perfect image of reality.<br />One would think books about teenage life would be depressing or sad, especially one dealing with bouts of your sexuality, but not this one, it is funny, upbeat and bound to make you smile. But it has a serious side too, toward the end of the story after everyone has grown and changed a bit.
B00000F6LQ|2.0|This is a great movie preformed by the legendary comedy troupe Monty Python.  I have nothing to say about the movie, other than everyone should watch it at least once even if you're not a Python fan.  This review is to serve as a warning to potential purchasers.  I purchased this movie only to find the discs were scratched due to a poor packaging design.  This 2 disc set stacks both discs one on top of the other on a single bracket, without a separator.  If you are unlucky like me the bracket was rather lose allowing the DVD's to rotate independently of one another, resulting in many tiny scratches rendering the feature DVD unreadable.  You can find the exact same features on the Special Edition (Wide Screen Edition) but without the movie cel and script, not to mention saving yourself some 20 bucks.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I personally think this album is pure amazing. while some songs sound nothing like them, they execute them with pure artistic talent. Maynard carries the vocals perfectly, always expressing as much emotion as his lyrics. The Jeordie and Josh form amazing rhythm together, while Billy is just Billy, self-explanatorily amazing. Some songs do hold the cohesion of prior APC songs, and do it damn well. What I really like is how it fluctuates from soft endings to hard openings. Perfect. A great album, I'd say equal in quality to Mer De Noms and definetly worth the $9.99 I got it for at Best Buy.
B000002UTH|4.0|I like this album. it has a good vibe. the first half contains more solid songs, such as jungle man, hollywood, and if you want me to stay (cover song) where the second half is choppy, containing very good tracks (blackeyed blonde, catholic school girls rule) and their signature throwaways (thirty dirty birds, sex rap) although those throwaways are very cool the first time around. And of course, the best song is Yertle the Turtle, which shows some hints of the chilis' later work. 4 stars, not-so good production quality, which could be good or bad-you decide
B000002UDB|5.0|Good stuff here...I guess this isn't quite as musically genius as Abbey Road, or even The White Album, but it's my favorite.  Guess I like all the songs on here, as two of my all time favorites are on here, Penny Lane, and Strawberry Fields Forever, which is chill and peaceful.  Other greats on here, definitely Hello, Goodbye and the title track, Magical Mystery Tour which is really happy. I am the Walrus is wonderful too, even though I have no idea what they're saying, it's a fun song. Finally, All You Need is Love is a wonderful song, with some great horns throughout...I guess this is the most melodic song on the album.  I think their most catchy and happiest songs are included on this CD.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|WONDERFUL AS ALWAYS SO FUNKY!<BR>STOP HATE-IN(I MEAN THAT) ON ERYYYY!<BR>I LOVE THIS SISTAS MUSIC!<BR>SHE WILL FOREVER BE THE BEST, AT WHAT SHE DOES!<BR>A BEAUTIFUL SOUL SISTA!<BR>SHE IS SMART AND CREATIVE!<BR>I LOVE HER!!!!

B000003TAW|4.0|Good pop-rock-not something you hear every day. but weezer has done it. blending catchy tunes (all of them) with some more complex ones (only in dreams), they create a stellar album, one that is only like a half-hour long. but that's not a bad thing, and if you want more, they have 3 other albums currently that are as good or almost. raw punk energy, emo, pop, don't worry about what kind it is. **And clean lyrics too** (not that i care)<BR>                    four and a half stars.....
0790729342|5.0|This 1981 action/adventure is an absolute must have for the true movie lover.  It's the second of three in a series, and although I've never seen the first one, I can say that this one puts the third one to shame.  The Road Warrior is Max, played by a young Mel Gibson, an ex-cop struggling to survive in the post-apocalyptic backroads of Australia.  Civilization as we know it is on the brink of perishing, as gangs of men terrorize the highways in pursuit of the most valuable commodity in these times: gasoline.  Max happens upon what appears to be the last of the civilized world, a group of 20 people banded together raising chickens who also happen to be producing petroleum.  While producing this petroleum, this group find themselves forced to live barricaded from a savage group of motorists that surround their fort-like community and the petroleum producing facility it contains.  Max makes a deal to help them find a way out of this home that has become a prison, but his life is on the line if he can't complete his mission.<br />The casting is perfect, as is the story, dialogue, plot, script, wardrobe, and cinematography.  Even after twenty years, it is still one of the best action movies you'll find out there.<br />On a side note, after its release, it won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for best foreign film.  It was also France's Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival winner for 1982, and in 1982, the Australian Film Institute awarded it for Best Direction, Best Achievement in Sound, Best Achievement in Production Design, Best Achievement in Editing, and Best Achievement in Costume Design.  It was, of course, also the movie that made Gibson an international star.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The matrix is about HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS. The Wachowski brothers do a good job of opening the average mind to the possibilities of something beyond the average way of thought. If you do your research, you'll see the matrix is very real, but certainly not what the movie depicts.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Please note: This review is for the Special Edition of \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" released 6/7/05 and was updated.<br /><br />Most of these reviews of Insurrection damn the film with faint praise. It wasn't this, it wasn't that. The Federation wouldn't do this. There's petty squabbles about legal points, etc. Writer Michael Piller clearly uses Star Trek Insurrection, much as Roddenberry did, as a soapbox to decry the injustices visited upon others. Usually he'd use Star Trek as a analogy of what had occurred in the past or present.<br /><br />The next to last installment in the \\"Trek\\" film franchise, \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" received a bad rap from the very beginning. Despite the fact that it was scripted by one of the series best writers (Michael Piller a producer and writer on \\"The Dead Zone\\") and directed by series vet/actor Jonathan Frakes the film was seen as disappointing as a follow up to the action driven \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\". While the film certainly lacks the intensity of \\"First Contact\\", the humor and thoughtfulness that drove some of the best episodes of the TV series remain remarkably intact. \\"Insurrection\\" certainly is much, much closer to an expanded bigger budget TV episode but it is by no means a bad \\"Trek\\" film.<br /><br />Data (Brent Spiner) while on a covert mission to gather information on an alien race called the Ba'ku malfunctions and exposes the mission to the natives. It seems that the radiation belt that surrounds the planet is a fountain of youth reversing aging for those that live there. The Federation in collaboration with a race called the Son'a plan on relocating the Ba'ku so that the Federation can \\"harvest\\" the radiation belt and use it to cure people of illnesses. The leader of the Son'a Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) demands that Vice-Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) contact the Enterprise and find out how to deactivate or destroy the android. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) elects to take the Enterprise there to the Ba'ku's planet and try deactivating Data while keeping him intact. He discovers a conspiracy among the Federation and the Son'a that he would never suspect.<br /><br />While it appears this is the same digital transfer as the first DVD issue, there's considerably better detail and crisper images as the result of improvements made since that first disc appeared. The deep, rich blacks and bright vivid colors of the planet come to life on this DVD. The wonderfully rich 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround and DTS mixes both sound terrific using the surrounding speakers exceedingly well. The DTS mix has the edge here with a deeper, richer bass and better overall presence but the two are exceptionally close in quality otherwise.<br /><br />Disc one is devoted to the film and text commentary. Disc two has all the extras on it. There's a number of deleted scenes including, most importantly, an alternate ending not previous seen. The alternate ending is actually fascinating although it might have been a bit confusing for some folks. Evidently Ru'afo's exposure to the metaphasic radiation turns him younger and younger. Sadly, the optical effects aren't in the alternate ending beyond some simple computer graphics. We also have Peter Lauritson introducing the deleted scenes and giving us background on why they didn't make it into the movie including an extended version of Ru'afo's facelift. Image quality for the deleted scenes aren't quite as good as the movie because they weren't color corrected and/or completed. We get more scenes of Riker and Troi flirting which are quite funny and actually would have worked within the film quite well as part of a \\"director's edition\\". There's also a scene where Picard kisses Anij that was cut.<br /><br />\\"The Star Trek Universe\\" focuses on the aliens created by make up artist Michael Westmore and the beautiful alien women throughout the run of the entire series and films.  Jonathan Frakes comments on his favorite alien women that Riker has seduced.<br /><br />\\"Production\\" looks at everything from the creation of the Ba'ku village in Thousand Oaks, California to the creation of one of the most elaborate stunts that wasn't SEEN in the movie. We get to see Data save some of the Ba'ku fighting three aliens who are armed taking all three out with one punch. \\"Creating the Illusion\\" shows us how the visual effects were created for three sequences; the shuttle chase involving Data, Picard and Worf; when the drones attack trying to transport the Ba'ku and the sequence involving the Duck Blind at the beginning when Data reveals there are Federation personnel invisible among the Ba'ku in their village. Each one is introduced by co-producer/ 2nd unit director Peter Lauritson. We also see the storyboards for the sequence and what the visuals look like at various stages of production.<br /><br />\\"The Story\\" features Michael Piller discussing their take on the screenplay. Piller relates the story to the obsessive culture of youth we live in and relates a personal experience that inspired the story. He discusses the metaphorical nature of the story but also the real world issues that underlie the story and that could be applied to the 21st century. We also get footage from the original featurette and interviews from around the same time incorporated into a new featurettte on the making of the movie. There's also a section on the advertising featuring the teaser trailer, theatrical trailer, the original promotional featurette that appeared on the previous DVD and the Borg Invasion Trailer for the Las Vegas attraction. There's an archieve section with Storyboards and a photo gallery.<br /><br />\\"Director's Notebook\\" consists of video footage shot behind the scenes of Frakes shooting the film. Featuring a new interview with Frakes discussing the approach to the story which he felt wasn't quite as strong as \\"First Contact\\". He felt that the look of the movie was a highlight of the film. He also discusses the difficulty in balancing the story so that both old Trek fans can enjoy it but also so that new Trek fans won't feel excluded. It's tremendously difficult with a franchise with so much backstory as the franchise has. He also discusses the challenges of acting in a film he's directing.<br />Oh, and keep your eye out for Easter eggs on the second disc. There's one that shows the craft services food and Marina Sirtis discussing how difficult it is for the actors to remain so slim. It's a bit tongue-in-cheek but also interesting. Look for some of the little logos to the left and right of the area where the menu is and click on them to access the Easter eggs.<br /><br />Surprisingly Jonathan Frakes either wasn't asked or elected not to do a commentary track for this film. It's a pity because Frakes' entertaining commentary track for \\"First Contact\\" was a highlight of that disc. He knows when to say something informative and when to stay quiet letting the film do the talking. Many directors could take lessons from Frakes in terms of doing a commentary track.<br /><br />There is an extensive text commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda that's both informative with trivia about everything from Gilbert and Sullivan, to set redresses from the \\"Voyager\\" TV show and \\"First Contact\\" movie. There's also humor which has been a hallmark of all the text commentary tracks that the Okudas have done. There's also plenty of trivia about various episodes and how they relate to the film. Of course, there's also some useless information that is there just to be there but, on the whole, the Okudas continue to be a fount of useful \\"Trek\\" information.<br /><br />\\"Insurrection\\" certainly deserved the deluxe treatment that \\"First Contact\\", \\"Generations\\" and \\"Nemesis\\" received in their DVD incarnations. Hopefully \\"Nemesis\\" (one of the most polarizing of \\"Trek\\" releases) will also be expanded to a two disc edition but incorporate the best features of the previous version. While not the best of the \\"Trek\\" films, \\"Insurrection\\" isa good, solid adventure that has lots of humor and fun throughout the film. The visual effects are, as usual, spectacular and this is our first glimpse of a completely computer generated Enterprise in a film. A top notch release from Paramount, I'd be curious to see how Paramount could possibly improve this edition when they release the High Definition version of this film on disc.Trek fans won't feel excluded.

B000002UJQ|3.0|great songs are all over this album. in fact, every song is great in its own way. it has standard rock filtered through electronic beats and colorful, textured vocals. these guys really are talented. Also there are acoustic songs and ballads.<BR>so why not give it 4 or 5 stars? well, i guess i shouldn't judge it like this, but considering all the praise, hype, and other albums radiohead has done, this one slipped under my expectations. That's not to say it ain't good cause it is. it's as good as people say it is, i'm just biased. I like it. blah blah blah. **plus you know 5 stars gets overused- one reason an album should get 5 stars is when it stands the test of time, doesn't get dated. Not cause it just came out and it's caTCHY (which i'm not saying this is)**
B00008NRI7|1.0|This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever watched.
B00006879E|5.0|What a fantastic CD!  There are no bad songs to skip and it's great from beginning to end.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|The cover art on Erykah Badu's new EP reads in part, &quot;Frequency is born and neo-soul is dead. Are you afraid of change?&quot; Frequency is Badu's new collective of musicians and producers who help her attempt to redefine her sound following two classic neo-sould albums. After nearly seven years in the business, Erykah's desire for a change in direction is understandable, but the result is a set that seems to lack direction all together. Many of the songs seem underdeveloped both lyrically and musically. &quot;Bump It&quot; and &quot;Back in the Day&quot; are non-descript jazz grooves that feature Erykah repeating the same lyrics over and over (a formula that is prevelant on most of the songs). The drum breakdown at the end of &quot;Bump It&quot; injects some life into the song, but coming at the eight minute mark, it is too late to save the song. &quot;Woo&quot; offers a funky groove with an improvised feel, but unlike Erykah's last recorded improvisiation, 1997's &quot;Tyrone&quot;, it fails to develop into a true song. &quot;The Grind&quot; starts off strong, with a hip-hop flavored take on neo-soul, but is undermined by a mediocre verse from M1 of the pseudo-revolutionary rap group Dead Prez. The EP does have it's moments. &quot;I Want You&quot; is a quirky and engaging groove that would have shined on either of Erykah's past albums, but isn't well utilized here, as it is sequenced between two mediocre tracks. The momentum begins to build with the blazing first single, &quot;Danger&quot;, a hip-hop flavored banger that conveys the stress of life in the grind both musically and lyrically. Next is &quot;Think Twice&quot;, a lively jazz bob workout featuring funky drumming and the hypnotic trumpet of Roy Hargrove. The momentum continues with &quot;Love of My Life Worldwide&quot;, a reworking of the Sequence classic &quot;Funk You Up&quot;. But eight tracks (plus and intro and outro) leaves zero margin for error, and just as Worldwide Underground begins to findits groove, its over. Hopefully this EP was just Erykah and Freakquency's warm-up lap for a more fully realized full length album in the near future, because Erykah is capable of much more.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is a complex and ambitious album. you can hear their old styles (she said she said, i want to tell you) contrasted by hints of their later material (tomorrow never knows, Doctor Robert) <BR>   It's kind of interesting that the more ambitious somgs on the record are mostly John's songs, and Paul keeps it traditional for the most part. This is interesting because on the next album, Sgt. Pepper, Paul all of a sudden takes great strides and commands the album, almost in a controlling way. Not to say that that's a bad thing, just that it's like he said, &quot;oh, whatever John did worked, I'll try that&quot;. <BR>   George has three songs on the album. He eventually wrote better songs, but I've heard this was just before he started to feel like maybe he didn't want to be in the band anymore. &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;I want to tell you&quot;, and &quot;Love you to&quot; show three sides of his abilities as a songwriter: politics, traditional love songs, and indian music respectively. Ringo is not flashy or anything, he never had any solos or shining moments, but he certainly did a good job, especially on tomorrow never knows. Overall, one of their many creative peaks, this album deserves just as much attention as it gets, no more, and no less.
B00008VGK0|5.0|One word, Great! When I bought it I addmit i was unsure if I like it, but I love It! Best Money I've ever spent! I love every song for differnt reasons. I listen to it like 24 hours a day!<BR>Best songs: Nobody Knows Me, Mother and Father, Nothing Fails, and American life! Like it... no i love it! Peace and light!
B000089RVX|4.0|The songs rock, Amy Lee's voice is strong and mature, and the strings are beautiful.  With that said: Care to hear where this style of spiritual nu-metal came from?  One word: VAST.  Even the lyrics are printed in a curved style similar to that of VAST's debut.<br />Evanescence has a solid sound built on nu-metal beats and guitar, cinematic strings, and the vocals of Amy Lee.  She sounds like a blend of Sarah MacLachlan and Anneke van Giersbergen (The Gathering).  Hopefully, on the next album they'll incorporate more variety; five songs are in that standby of dramatic keys, E-minor.  It would be easy to fall into the Creed trap and play it safe with 38 versions of &quot;Bring Me To Life.&quot;<br />The eleven tracks break down into Style A (mid-tempo angst rock) and Style B (haunting piano ballad).  The ever-present strings give &quot;Fallen&quot; a concept album feel.<br />It's worth waiting for &quot;Bring Me To The Song That's Better Than The Daredevil Movie&quot; to hear &quot;Going Under.&quot;  &quot;My Immortal&quot; has an elegiac strength and some nice strings from film composer Graeme Revell (&quot;The Crow&quot;).  &quot;Haunted&quot; is my personal favorite, the most &quot;goth&quot; song on the album.  The speed-metal drums after the first chorus contrast nicely with the beautiful singing.  The choir is just icing on the cake.<br />&quot;Tourniquet&quot; is another winner, with its overtly Christian lyrics.  The orchestral break at the end is gorgeous, a chance to catch your breath after all the intensity of the CD so far.  &quot;Imaginary&quot; is pretty much an offshoot of &quot;Haunted.&quot;  &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; would fit just fine on Disturbed's &quot;The Sickness.&quot;  &quot;Hello&quot; is my other favorite, a sister piece to &quot;My Immortal.&quot;<br />My only big gripe: I don't like the way Lee's eyes follow me all over the damn place on the CD cover.  I've never been good at staring contests.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I've been a Bowie fan since the early 90s when I started discovering his vast back catalog and realizing how much he took every era of music he lived in and both reflected it, pushed it, and transformed it with his work.  Reality is another offering in that vein.  This album is not something that you can take in all at once in the first, second, or even third listen through.  It's extremely multi-tiered, like most of his past work, especially the stuff in the 90s.  <br />Even more interestingly, he seems to be shifting his focus from reflecting the current music being presented in the mass market to actually drawing on and extrapolating from his own recent work, making it an end unto itself.  The songs Days, Reality, and The Lonliest Guy seem to push his own sound particularly.  Admittedly, there aren't as many songs on this album that I immidiately warmed up to as on Earthling or Outside, but it does start to grow on you very quickly, and clearly outshines Hours and Heathen very early on.  <br />His attitude and &quot;Bowieness&quot; are particularly well presented in the cuts Pablo Picasso (a cover of the Modern Lovers' classic) and Bring Me The Disco King, where his tongue in cheek sense of irony and cold introspection at the world around him surface, respectively.  On the special edition of the disc, you do get a cover of Rebel Rebel wich along makes the special edition worth having.  <br />All in all, this album seems to cement in place a trilogy that was started a few years ago with the Hours album, and brings this period in the evolution of Bowie to a succinct and self-realized conclusion.  I can't wait to see what the future holds.
B000092ZYX|4.0|good and original. Flowing. long and worth the money, but keeps it to the point. takes a few tries. Amazingly rewarding album. my parents liked it, and they don't like anything. Key tracks: 2+2=5, sit down. stand up., we suck young blood, go to sleep. The gloaming reminds me of what they did on amnesiac, and kid a especially. electronics, guitars like you wouldn't belive, drums and interesting beats, key and time signatures, less guitar oriented than the bends or ok computer, but almost as good.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|a perfect circle is a great band and i think there sweet
0316666343|3.0|This novel herald among the best of the best in NY times bestsellers; so it was no surprise that this book has to be read.  Sebold is an amazing writer able to articulate feelings into words.  I found myself tearing as the emotions flow along the pages.  I like this book, but I don't love it, it did not deliver a great ending to the characters, but I suppose that is the beauty of it.  The book is about a girl who was brutally killed; her killer at large; her soul linger among her love ones and witnessing the pain of her untimely death.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing album.  If you liked the first APC album you can't go wrong with this one.  There are a couple metaphorical themes going on, from The Noose which continues on with Blue and then Vanishing/A Stranger/The Outsider.  The transition between Pet and Lullaby has to be heard to be believed.  Pet is metaphorical of the madness of terrorism and the mess in Iraq.  Maynard really brings the album to life like he does with all his work.  That is not to say that the other members deserve just as much credit... you _must_ listen to this album.
B000002GK1|5.0|I don't like using genres to classify music if I can help it. To say that these guys were grunge would sometimes work, but then so would a lot of other genres. This  album feels more like an album than a collection of individual songs. More pop-oriented songs include rusty cage and drawing flies. Songs that at first I had a hard time listening to but grew on me include new damage, slaves and bulldozers, and searching with my good eye closed. And you can tell all of them helped write Jesus christ pose, because it sounds so huge and triumphant-my  favorite track. I don't give many 5 star ratings, but this is just one of those albums, it's really that good. reccommended.
0393057658|5.0|Baseball may never be the same, yet nothing is. Moneyball has taken a look at where the game is today and where it is headed in the near future. A must read book for all fans (past and present) of &quot;America's National Past-Time.&quot;
B000063TS9|5.0|I'm astonished that no one has reviewed this CD (until now) which came out over a year ago. It is an astonishingly assured set of performances by the youngish cellist turned conductor, Dmitry Yablonsky, and the Russian State Orchestra. (And, even better, there is a DVD-Audio of these same performances that just came out and it is in superb surround sound. Yeehaw!)<br />This is Shostakovich at his most accessible. It's all jazzy, tuneful, interestingly orchestrated (he does things with the xylophone that he must have picked up from watching cartoons with music by Carl Stallings--do you suppose?). And there are some saxophone licks that couldn't have been composed by anyone but a Russian (although, the idea came to me after imagining in my mind's ear the saxophone solos in Musorgsky's 'Pictures at an Exhibition' and the most familiar orchestration of THAT is by a Frenchman, Ravel--oh, well, the TUNE is Russian).<br />This is, in fact, music that Shostakovich wrote in imitation of American popular music. [In fact, 'Tahiti Trot' is his take of Vincent Youmans's 'Tea for Two.'] There's even a Sousa march in the first Jazz Suite. And he gets it all almost right and inimitably Shostakovian as well. It's right enough that American listeners will probably be fooled--if they listen to it without knowing the composer--into believingt it had to be by someone like Ferde Grofe or Gershwin or even Leroy Anderson.<br />My point is this: this is Shostakovich's happiest, bounciest, most accessible music. And on top of that it's beautifully written and performed. I don't know what you're waiting for.<br />I had my wife waltzing around the listening room just a few days ago to a new recording of waltzes by Lehar. But I grabbed her again when I'd cranked this one up and we waltzed and polka'd and even tango'd. It's impossible to resist.<br />Recommended heartily. And even more so, if you've got the equipment for it, I recommend the new DVD-Audio version.<br />Scott Morrison
0060987464|5.0|From the first word to the last word...this book was honestly the best book i have ever touched...He is so real throughout the whole book and doesnt throw u anything that isnt true. After reading this i have much more respect for him. He has gone through hell and is still doing good...people say hes messed up but once you read this book you literally take a walk through his sick life. And after reading this i realized that he isnt even that messed up...if i were in his shoes and went through what he did i dont think i would still be alive. Its so descriptive too that i could almost know and walk through where he grew up. I love this book to death and read it over and over....the only thing i really have to say is click the little add to cart button...really<BR>~Alex
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|First of all, Thirteenth Step is not an &quot;easy&quot; album. After hearding it for the first time I didn't have a clue if I will like it or not. Fortunantly &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; did grow on me I have started to like it quite a lot, but I think it can be a quite a shock for some people, at least in the beginning. (tip: listen it with headphones for few times) The sound is slightly different (extremely dynamic), tempo overall is slower and there isn't that many &quot;hit&quot; songs. I have now listened the album about 4 days and it has grown from 3 stars to 5. I don't think it is an album for everyone (I, personally am a huge Tool and APC fan), but it shouldn't be judged before you have really listened to for quite a few times.
0316666343|3.0|Most readers know by now that The Lovely Bones is told from the perspective of a deceased main character, Susie, a young girl who has been brutally raped and murdered.  Oddly enough, this seemingly emotion-ladden story comes across as vague and emotionless.  Susie's narration is so matter-of-fact that much of the emotional impact of what she is describing is lost.  The author portrays the reactions of Susie's family to her death in a very real and well-written manner, yet there is a distance there--perhaps the distance that Susie herself feels as she looks down on her loved ones from heaven.  From Susie's perspective, we see heaven as a place that is wonderful yet also sad, as paradise does not prevent Susie from longing for those she left behind.  The story meanders through many years, never quite reaching a point of conclusion.  Although I found this novel to be disappointing, Sebold certainly has shown significant promise for the future, and I wouldn't hesitate to read her next book.
0312983867|4.0|In the eighth book of the Stephanie Plum series, Stephanie must track down a missing mother and daughter. Her task isn't made easy with the woman's ex and violent landlord breathing down her neck. Stephanie also seems to be having bad luck with animals lately. She must fend off snakes, spiders, geese, and a lunatic in a bunny suit. Also, with Morelli out of the picture, Ranger steps up his pursuit of Stephanie.<br />The thing that I love about this series is that it's dependable. You can always count on Stephanie blowing up a few cars and the Stephanie/Morelli/Ranger love triangle will probably never be resolved. It's also the only series that I can think of that is repetitive with out becoming boring or going down in quality. With Stephanie Plum you always know that you are going to get a zany, fun, mystery and that's a good thing.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I just bought the album today after much anticipation, and i honestly was expecting more. To put it bluntly, Mer de Noms (The First Album) runs Perfect Circles around Thirteenth Step. I would rate Mer de Noms a solid 4 stars, for those of you who wish to calibrate my judgement with your own. When i heard the first album, i knew after the first listening that it was going to be a favorite. I didnt feel that with this album, and its really going to have to grow on me as i listen to it more. The band, however, maintains its &quot;grenade with it's pin pulled&quot; nervous-calm that keeps it mellow and ultimately distinquishes<BR>it's sound from Tool.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|&quot;Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.&quot; After 25 years, ANIMAL HOUSE Double Secret Probation (Universal) arrives in a fresh digital transfer with MTV-like pop-ups that footnote the movie. John Landis' film spoofed frat life and spawned a whole sub-genre of teen gross-out flicks. The crazed genius of John Belushi explodes with his sustained incarnation of Bluto Blutarsky.  Crude,  irreverent, offensive but still fun.  Groove with the Otis Day rendition of &quot;Shout&quot; in a newly minted 5.1 sound mix.
B0000A02TZ|2.0|Animal House is and always will be one of my all time favorite films.  I couldn't wait to see &quot;Double Secret Probation&quot;.  I was keenly disappointed!  The add ons barely made me smile.  Buy this DVD only if you don't own already own Animal House.  If you already have it, save your money &amp; skip this one.

0786915749|3.0|Yet another long epic fantasy book, Weiss and Hickman's first entry in their Dragonlance series has nothing new to offer fantasy fans.  The abundant cliches are only outnumbered by the large group of uninteresting characters that undertakes a journey that's already been taken countless times before.<BR>     The plot revolves around a core group of adventurers: a half-elf/half-man leader, a hobbit-like thief, a mysterious magician, his warrior twin, an out-dated knight, a pair of barbarian lovers, and a grumpy dwarf.  They undertake a quest to stop an evil cleric who, under the command of the Queen of Darkness, has started a war between good and evil.  <BR>     A large problem with this book is that their are too many characters.  Along with the main eight characters, many more join in the quest.  By the end, there are about thirteen heroes to keep track of.  Unfortunately, this ridiculous number leads to some dull character development, as if the two authors ran out of personalities to write.  Instead of turning into three-dimensional characters that we would care about, each character only has a few traits.  For example, Tanis the leader doesn't like to fight.  Sturm the knight is always suspicious of Raistlin the magician.  Caramon the warrior is always hungry.  I found Sturm to be a pointless character who was almost identical to Caramon.  One trait that I found to be annoying was the fact that everyone was quite fearful most of the time.  Though it was more realistic having the group be afraid of the dangers they faced, reading about how scared each character was everytime they entered a dark cave took the excitement out of the book.  Even Tas, a character who lacked the emotion of fear, seemed scared at times.<BR>     Weiss and Hickman try to incorporate some originality into their group of adventurers.  Instead of being close friends, everyone in the group mistrusts each other and bicker over one another.  However, this book has far too many fantasy cliches that aren't put to good use.  Flint the dwarf is identical to the dwarf from R. A. Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels or Gimli from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.  The heroes' leader conveniently finds a magic sword that can slay dragons.  Elves are mistrustful of all other species, dragons are large and in charge, and an evil goddess is the main villian.  It seemed as if the authors were using these cliches as rules to write their book, causing the end product to seen like another by-the-numbers fantasy.<BR>     There were some elements that made this book far from dreadful.  Raistlin, the dark magician, is the most interesting character by far.  He could easily carry a full story on his own.  Other interesting characters were Fizban, the bumbling mage and Tas, the lovable kender.  The action is well done and fast-paced.  I hated the draconians, however, and found myself wishing for ogres or more goblins.<BR>     Compared to Salvatore's Dark Elf series, this is a weak start for a trilogy of books.  The only reason I'm going to read the next installment is because I had a little case of impulse buying and bought the next trilogy of books in the series, so I have to finish the first trilogy before I can go on.  I'd rather reread &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|All I can really say about this is well unless you are a true Iron Maiden fan I sudgest you don't bother wasting your money. Instead go out and get A Brave New World, or One of their older cd's like Number of the Beast, or even Killers. I just don't think that any person who likes Iron Maiden as a day to day fan should spend their money on a half decent Cd.
B00009MGQL|3.0|On first listen I was a little more excited, but repeat listens have not held up so well. I really dig the drum & bass thing, but it's like not-that-hip d&b...if you're gonna do it, hire the right cats otherwise it just sounds like another jungle groove from any number of car commercials out there. <br />JB can really play but he doesn't make the greatest albums. That said there are still a few gem moments on this cd so if you're a JB fan (by this I mean you like pretty much anything he does) you'll like it but you might find it collecting dust soon. I think \\"You Had It Coming\\" was a little bit better and is worth it for the very last tune.
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel's Booker Prize winning novel is an amazing work.  Told with the lightest of touches, the beauty, humour and sheer savagery of Pi's world will stay with you for a long time.  It has been months since I finished the novel, and I can't get it out of my mind.  Other books read since pale by comparison. Some of Pi's adventures in the lifeboat with Richard Parker (the Bengal Tiger) are harrowing, but it is the final chapters that are truly stunning.  The final sentence left me with tears in my eyes. This may well be the best book that I have ever read -it's certainly the best I've read in the past few years.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I bought Hail to the Thief about a month ago and have not been able to put it away yet; it's that good! This is my third Radiohead album (Pablo Honey and Kid A being the others). Pablo Honey is enjoyable to all lengths, and Kid A is just beautiful. This album, to me, is different. 2+2=5 is pretty rockin'. The distorted guitar and open hi-hat of the drums really work well with the singing. Sail to the Moon is a beautifully done track. There, There grooves really hard. Good god, I don't know if I have enough space to go through every song, but you get the idea thus far. <BR>Long story short, Hail to the Thief is perhaps the best CD I have bought this year. I say buy it. If you don't trust me, I say buy it. JUST BUY IT!!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The wait was killing me for the last months, but now, I can enjoy the excellent work of the better group of musicians in the world. When I heard of Metallicas return I suppose that it was going to be something good but it was trash. Now Iron Maiden on the other hand have a really nice material that is gonna be with me for long time playing in my head. My personal recommendations: No More Lies, Dance Of Death, Wildest Dreams. Dont miss this unique album. Sell St. Anger and buy this one.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album seems to be taking the band into a different direction with deeper textures and a touch of some Toolish qualities in the rhythm.  Its even more melodic then the previous album Mer De Noms, and it seem Maynerd has calmer demeanor in his vocals this time around, which I find surprising.  Overall I do not think 13th step surpasses Mer De Noms, but is still a solid album worth having in you collection.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|The Italian Job holds enough funny moments and action to keep you entertained and it never gets boring! It has it all, and it ends with the perfect ending.  Don't wait to see this movie!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|There is no other album that has affected me as much as OKC.  Yes, that includes Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd).  You get lost in this CD, the way you expect music to take you away.  Yorke's voice is operatic, and the crescendos are magnificent in each of the songs.  The structural changes are bizarrely different, yet make total sense as you hear them.<br />This is my favorite album of all time.  For good reason.  Enjoy.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD is going to be so good, I can already tell! I've heard a few leaked songs already and it sounds awesome!! It will be in my hands in only a few short hours...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I dont now why? but this cd was out in Puerto Rico on September 13,2003. It was out before it was released in the states and I have to say that it is awesome. The first thing to notice is the bass, JEORDIE(Twiggy) sounds a lot better than the former bassit Paz. The lyrics are usual if you are a Maynard James Keenan fan and the music is like nothing I've heard before, it sounds different than the first album but just as great. I recommend to listen to LULLABY, WEAK AND POWERLESS, THE NOOSE, etc. The album is really great, from start to end, from THE PACKAGE to GRAVITY it's going to take you throug a journey of PERFECT music.
1878424114|5.0|It was by pure accident that I bought this book.  Some friends and I had traveled to another city to celebrate another friend's birthday and ended up staying overnight at her house.  Well, as I was up earlier than the others because we'd stayed up late visiting, I decided to go for a little walk so I wouldn't disturb them and what did I find but a neighbor having a rummage sale.  I am a sucker for books and couldn't help but pick up some and this was one of them.  Everyone wants to be successful, right?  <br />There are seven laws: Pure Potentiality, Giving, Karma or Cause and Effect, Least Effort, Intention and Desire, Detachment, Dharma or Purpose in Life.  Much of the advice that he gives coincides with the bible.  Like not judging, giving, wishing everyone well, etc.  I tried a little of it and felt good and I really think that if you apply his instructions in life, it will make a big difference.  It isn't always as easy to do as he says because we have a lifetime of living a different lifestyle, but I feel if I am persistent, it will make all the difference.  I am just going to have to work out the stress and worry I feel about the direction our country is heading, figure out how to use his laws constructively to help solve the problems.  I believe it will be possible.  Anyway, for what it is worth I believe if you follow his instructions that you will succeed.  Very interesting book!
B00000JGHM|5.0|Two of the best, if not the best actors, of all time in one brilliantly written and directed film!!!!  I dont know whose performance was better....... Pacino or De Niro's?  That should be something no one should have to choose.  What can I say that hasnt been said.  Great movie, deserves all 5 stars.  But it was sad seeing De Niro get it at the end... Even if you dont like Pacino or De Niro see this movie anyway.  it is guaranteed to make you a fan!
B00005ABX0|4.0|Who knows what &quot;Smile&quot; might've been had it emerged as Brian Wilson originally intended?  Might've been the masterpiece we're led to believe, might not have. The fish that get away are always the biggest.<br />But we're left with &quot;Smiley Smile.&quot;  Remnants.  Rerecordings.  Scraps.  It's strange music: Happy, frightening, twisted, goofy, &quot;wacky&quot; and perverse, it's like a grossly deformed but hopelessly affectionate kitten -- you want to recoil but it's just so damn eager and loveable.  <br />I don't recommend &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; for everyone, and I understand the frustration some feel toward it, but two years ago I listened to the album frequently for the entire fall and realized something.  You have to come to it, it doesn't really come to you.  If you can come to the music and make a connection with it, you'll have a great time.  If not, it just sounds like a party at which you're the only sober person.  And &quot;Wild Honey&quot; just doesn't do too much at all for me, but I reckon it didn't really cost nothing.<br />Listen to this carefully and you'll hear that people you probably like (or should like) have visited here before: Beck, Jon Brion, the Beastie Boys, Money Mark, the Bonzos, Badly Drawn Boy, etc, et al.
B00005JLXE|4.0|The critical and public reaction to Daredevil has been predictable:  this is yet another case of a movie that primarily has been panned by people who don't care for its genre, and praised by people who do.<br />I found the movie itself to be very watchable.  Other than the &quot;park battle sequence&quot; between Elektra and Murdock, which was just too over-the-top, the film is old-school super-heroics presented with such confidence and visual flair that anyone who enjoys comic-book superheroes should get a kick out of it.  Affleck's performance as Matt Murdock is especially good (easily as believable as Toby Maquire's much-ballyhooed turn as Peter Parker in Spider-Man).  As recent superhero movies go (IMHO), this is one of the best, much more entertaining than Hulk, just as engaging as Spider-Man, albeit not quite up to the standards of the two X-Men films.<br />The extras are rather more of a mixed bag.  I cared little for the features dealing with the movie, but the longish &quot;Men Without Fear&quot; feature, a series of interviews with the writers and artists of the Daredevil comic book, is wonderful.  Stan Lee is as likable as ever, and I found Frank Miller surprisingly chatty and funny.
B000002C1V|4.0|This is a supremely underrated album, too often spitted on by Floyd fans.  The songs are dark but beautiful, and The Final Cut is better than any solo work done by Waters.  Not Now John, The Final Cut, The Gunner's Dream, and Fletcher Memorial Home are my faves.    EDIT: This should be 5 stars, not 4.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I love rock n' roll (featured in crossroads) was the best, while Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana sung in the backround too. well done!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you look the people who worked in this album you have to be sure that it will be one of the better cd that you ever heard.<BR>Besides.....Maynard James Keenan is the best vocal in all the world....he will make you hate and cry too.<BR>Weak and powerless the first song available of the disc is beautiful.....Buy it !!!!<BR>Troy.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Coming into this cd, Mer De Noms was by far my favorite cd in all aspects. After hearing the the single &quot;Weak and powerless&quot; I could definatly tell the difference of sound from when Troy and Paz had left and now were replaced. The first song &quot;The Package&quot; in my opinion is the best song on the album and really shows how great of a vocalist Maynard is. The rest of the album is a great cd if you do not compare it to Mer De Noms, but it's missing a lot of aspects which made the first cd so great. Overall It's a cd that shouldn't be missing from your collection but give it some time before you judge it, the more you listen to it the more it should grow on you.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I bought this CD a few days ago and I'm hooked. There first CD was good but this one is even better. They have perfected their melodies to get perfect hardcore with emo. I highly recommend this CD as I do their previous one, Sounding the 7th Trumpet. So what are you waiting for, run down to your local music shop and pick it up.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|with Badu not much has changed in terms of Her vocal or Her overall Presentation but the Music holds up more so for me than Her Voice which gets flater&flater with each passing release.I dug Her a bit at first but things have cooled off.I like the Arrangements on some of the cuts here but overall She plays it fairly safe.the Album on a whole is Average to Pretty Good on a whole to Me.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Personally, i didn't like \\"Merd de Noms\\", A Perfect Circle's debut album, plus i've heard Twiggy Ramirez, ex-Marylin Manson bassplayer, joined the band, so in short, i didnt expect much from their forthcoming album \\"Thirteenth Step\\"...<BR>As a Tool fanatic, it doesnt seem to matter how bad Tool would might go or their sideprojects suck, like a good groupie, i'll always buy their new, either disappointing or successful stuff. Thats the essence of a fanatic.<BR>And the same thing about buying this album, but to my suprice this baby won't have to be left on my Cd counter with the rest of Tool's work but be played on my Cd-player very oftenly.<BR>Since i got this album (yesterday), i just can't stop listening to it. It has such a new and complex appealing sound which redefines A Perfect Circle as a successfuly Maynard-inspired (and featued) band, and even tops that with few nuances and   new, lyrically and especcialy musicaly, depthes.<BR>This album is one of these album you have in your collection with a true and unforgetable feeling and atmosphere which in no matter what situation you're at, it comes back to you, suprices you and challanges you.<BR>A Real surprice by incredible artists. even though i referred a lot to Maynard here i know this album is an equal work between these musicans in the \\"A Perfect Circle\\" project. Respect!<BR>Don't hesitate, you music lover whatever style you're into or hate, this album has a neutral nature and from hardcore trancers and clubbers to black-metalheads and even more softcore jazz, ambient and chillout personals could enjoy and appreciate this art of work. Go out and consume this at your locally recordstore.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|With an excellent album, there must be sensations gathered between the artists in the band, which in turn, burn through the effect that you're meerly listening to a common task of recorded tracks, mixed to death. its really nice to know that there is real music surviving in the corporate [music] today. you listen to the radio entirely too much and then its like bang!, new music that is so original and good. its such a surprise, a treat to the public. for moods undefined, i recommend for all. maynard does it, and he does it well.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;, is one of the finest recordings of his career.  The sadness and power of this recording is further enhanced by the fact Johnny was in ill health, and the listener can feel his pain.  His take on the tune &quot;Hurt&quot; says it all about excess in life and aging.  His covers of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;' &quot;In My Life&quot;, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;' &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Well Meet Again&quot;, are all sung from the heart of an aging music icon, who must have known his life was comming to an end, and delivered the goods one more time.  This album should win many awards[Grammy's, Country music awards] not because of sentimental reasons that he has passed, but because this cd is a stunning work of art, that most young country stars couldn't match if they wanted to.  Now that the younger generation has been exposed to Johnny Cash via MTV, thanks to his phenominal video for &quot;Hurt&quot;, hopefully they will understand that like Johnny Cash, none of us stay young forever.  Rest in peace Johnny Cash.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Let's see, i've been waiting for something new to drop from Erykah Badu for about three years now, since \\"Mama's Gun\\" dropped.  It's really hard to compare this disc to her previous cd's because the sound is so different.  The sound here is a lot more funky, more old-school hip-hop and more upbeat than on \\"Baduizm\\" and \\"Mama's Gun\\".  Right now, i'm feeling the \\"Love of My Life Worldwide\\" remix and \\"I Want You\\".  The only real regret I have about this disc is that it's an EP and I want to hear more of Badu's creativity.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I must admit that I have not seen the movie until much much later and the only reason I went was the music. My friend told me that she saw the movie and the music just rocked. I downloaded a sample (Track nr 3) and fell in love with it. I watched the movie (it was great) and I just ordered the CD. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes high-energy music that will improve your mood and make you feel as if you were on a pirate adventure with Jack Sparrow on the Black Pearl.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This was the first Blink cd I ever bought and I love it.<br />1. Dumpweed: 8/10: Good song but gets old<BR>2. Don't Leave Me: 6/10: Not too fond of this one<BR>3. Aliens Exist: 8/10: Great song with good lyrics<BR>4. Going Away To College: 9/10: Great song for you to sing to your girlfriend<BR>5. What's My Age Again: 8/10: Great song<BR>6.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This alabum is just amazing, way more beautiful than Mer De Noms but at the same such an awesome sequel. <BR>The cd is a mixture of slowliness, perfection and feelings created to take you away during the time the record last.<BR>Maynard is a little more personal on this one.<BR>Songs that should be checked out: Weak &amp; Powerless (Video already on MTV), The Nurse Who Loved Me, Blue, Gravity.

B0000BYM3K|3.0|Maiden has put out an average album after the powerful return of Bruce on Brave New World.  If it weren't for the relentless repetitive choruses on virtually every song, the rating would have been higher.  Also, the number of 7+ minute epics is getting a little carried away.  Reduce the repitition and several songs could be in the 5 minute range and be much more listenable.  I had hoped for better after all this time, but it is still a worthwhile investment.
B000002J2D|5.0|After quite sleepy and too Progressive &quot;Wind and wuthering&quot; a phenomenal guitarist Steve Hackett left the band to form a his own band.This step was a prelude to one of the most biggest style change in Genesis career.from art-rock to pop.<BR>but on &quot;and then there were three&quot; genesis didn't went in &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Invisible touch&quot; hits area...<BR>still we are listening great emotional and powerfull Progressive rock.<BR>Mike Rutheford took a place of lead guitarist after Steve.he is definitly a great bass player but his guitar style is a bit anemic compared to early seventies records.still he shines in many moments (&quot;Burning rope&quot;,&quot;deep in a motherlode&quot;)Phil sings much more natural than before and his drumming is superb.and of course Tony Banks - one of the best living keyboardists in the world.so now we have a Supergroup!<BR>the beginning track &quot;Down and out&quot; is almost an artistic manifest - loud,heavy and fast rock track with an interesting lyrics about a life of an famous music-star.a great track that will not leave oyur head so fast.&quot;Afterglow&quot;,&quot;Say it's all right joe&quot;,&quot;Many too many&quot; and &quot;follow you follow me&quot; are great,melancholic ballads.Phil sings there best as he can.<BR>&quot;Deep in the motherlode&quot;,&quot;Scenes from a night dream&quot;,&quot;Ballad of big&quot; are fantastic rock songs.but the most important track from album is an epic 7 minutes composition &quot;Burning rope&quot; - in my opinion one of the best long tracks in band's career.it ia a charming warm ballad with moving lyrics about nature and marvelous bass line.guitar solo in the middle is simply amazing...<BR>in general - there is too many too write about this fantastic piece of music.It is the best Genesis album recored as a trio (banks,Collins,Rutheford) and the richest in many soundscapes.it is funny that the band was trying to make a dreamworld atmosphere as a quartet and they made it best as a three person group.simply - a masterpiece.<BR>a great album to start with Genesis!
1558908420|5.0|The movie Cop Land combines long lost talent in its leading star, Sylvester Stallone; top notch performances from its supporting cast, Ray Liotta, Robert Deniro, Harvey Keitel, and Annabella Sciorra; wonderful cinematography by Eric Edwards; and brilliant direction of James Mangold who later went on to direct such hits as Kate And Leopold, Identity, and Girl Interrupted.<br />Cop Land is a fictional tale of crime and corruption in a city run and occupied by New York's unfinest cops. Stallone pulls it off excellently as the city's overweight sherrif, Freddie Heflin, who couldn't get into to the force on account of his deaf ear. When the police force covers up a cop shooting that leaves two innocent men dead and stages a hero story, its up to Sherrif Heflin to reveal the truth and bring order to the city known to everybody as Cop Land.<br />The movie features an outstanding performance by Robert Deniro as an FBI agent trying to uncover the deceptions and opens Heflin's eyes to the corruption around him.<br />A memorable film with an even more memorable ensemble cast.
B000002KFJ|5.0|man, this cd is great abosolite classic black sabbath, before they began to [perform badly] ( after the firing of ozzy) they still had black magic in their bags
B000006TRV|5.0|Everyone knows about \\"The Wall\\", as the #3 best selling album of all time it certainly deserves its place.<br />This album is a somewhat introspective journey through the psyche of the worn out rocker, \\"Pink\\". The loss of his father in WW2 before he ever really knew him, his overbearing mother, the loss of his wife to another man, the drugs, and the \\"too much too soon\\" situation he is in all compound into figurative \\"wall\\" that shields the real him from outside influences, and keeps the real him from being seen. Inside this wall, he loses his sanity one step at a time, until finally he retreats into a fantasy world where an imaginary \\"judge\\" finds him guilty of showing feelings, and sentences him to \\"be exposed\\" by all his peers. <br />But on the outside of this wall things are very different. Pink becomes something of a \\"nazi\\", in that he's extremely prejudiced and takes advantage of his fans. He becomes exactly what his father fought against, and it is after this that the trial begins in his fantasy world.<br />The album climaxes with the wall falling down and Pink being exposed as the scared, scarred, and confused man he really is.<br />While this album isn't Pink Floyd's best work, it is their most mainstream and best selling one. It is a definite must for any Floyd fan, and a great starting point for those just getting into it. Do yourself a favor, buy this one today.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Nobody compares to Maynard James Keenan in vocal and songwriting greatness. I got this on the midnight release off of Virgin Mega here in s.f. and need i say more? Got that right! I cant stop listening to this masterpiece. NEXT UP? Cant wait for the next TOOL record.
B00004T9UF|1.0|This guy reminds me of a whining little baby crying over spilled milk.I dont feel any sympathy for this guy and I wished hed stop with his mommy issues and seek therapy.This white little punk who pretends to be hard thug wouldnt last a day where im from.If hes so tough,then why does he need an army of security?As far as the album,the beats are too repetitive and the lyrics are absolute trash.Hes just another commercial puppet like britney spears who will be unheared of in another 2 years.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|As many of you already know, A Perfect Circle features Maynard James Keenan from Tool. Maynard's already in one talented band, so why would he need to be in another one? Mer De Noms was already put out by APC back in 2000, and while it was a great album, it merely hinted at what Billy Howerdel (guitarist, composer, writer), was capable of. Thirteenth Step is a fantastic evolution of APC's musical formula. Each track is extremely distinct from the next, showing off intense musical diversity. Maynard's singing is top-notch here, and Billy's guitar playing is even better. His abstract tunings and innovative techniques are all present, adding deep texture to the songs. The best part of all, though, is new bassist Jeordie White (Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson). His bass lines are absolutely amazing, standing on there own as something spectacular while fitting into the song with an almost frightening accuracy. There is one downpoint to this whole record though: The Nurse Who Loved Me. This song is a Failure cover, and it seems very out of place on here. It's not too much of an annoyance, it'll just take you with surprise the first time you hear it...but maybe that's what the band intended :) Overall, a fantastic and meticulously crafted album that can't be ignored... it's just too f*cking good.
B00006690G|1.0|I might offend some people by saying this,but the truth is that this guy will be just another trend like vanilla ice was.His lyrics are on a fourth grade level and the music has too many repetitive beats which make it boring.Eminem,get over it we all know you have mommy issues so shut up already.Since he has no real talent he has to sample every other song on the album.I cant beleive this guy uses his own daughter just to sell records.To conclude,stay away from this commercialized garbage and start listening to real artists like black sabbath,iron maiden and sepultura.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!
0156027321|1.0|After reading all the reviews you know what the book is about so I won't summarize yet again. I recommended this book to my husband before I read it and he was not enthused at all.  He kept plugging and finished it but had nothing good to say about it.  I read the reviews and thought he just didn't know a good thing.  Then I read it and I realized he did know what he was talking about.  I struggled to finish it just as he did. During the author's explicit detail describing PI eating everthing from turtle's warm blood to tiger feces, I continued to question why I was still reading this book.  There are so many wonderful books out there to read, don't waste your time on this one.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|After the excellent single Weak and Powerless, and the brilliant debut album Mer de Noms, this album does not quite live up to my expectations. Maybe they are too high but for mine this album is too soft and seems to fill a couple of tracks with less than what you would call a song.<br />In saying the above, it is important to also note that there are a couple of other good tracks on the album! Pet instantly stood out as a cracker. It is a heavier number and just seemed to remind me of what A Perfect Circle were all about on Mer de Noms. The Package and Gravity are also very good songs.
0780624890|5.0|Well, I still have to buy this one.  I'm hoping they come out with a part 3 though, so I can buy all of them in a box set perhaps.<br />Anyway, I just adore this movie.  Probably my favorite vamp movie ever.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I even liked it better then the second.<br />I suppose this is more of a thumbs up for the movie then a review :)  NOW RENT IT!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|that's the closest thing i can think to describe this album. its progressive, listenable, and touches all sorts of musical ground. its very light to digest if you want it to be...and dark and moving. i was at the store @ 10AM to buy it. it supercedes mer de noms...however impossible it seems. its truly truly worth your money, unless you're starving. maynard's vocals are fresh, billy's riffs are next to none, and even jeordie sounds great in the mix. i was skeptical, but i believe in the guy now. josh's drumming is great also....as usual. Any APC fan...any fan of ANYTHING should own this album. as a musician, i think this is a true masterpiece
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|A7X has just broken into a new world of music with Waking The Fallen. Their first album kicked bum but this one is way better. In my opinion there are no filler songs, all of the tracks have great guitar parts and lyrics. The singing is better in this album too. Every song is filled with greatness of music, not a bad track on the entire album. If I had to choose a favorite song I think it would have to either be unholy confessions, remenissions, or and all things will end
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i went out and bought this album today...the day it was release.  APC is my favorite band in the world.  this album is just as good as Mer de Noms.  go get this CD if your into good music!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Just picked up the new CD at Amazon.com and I didn't know what to expect. After listening to the entire CD, I have found a new <BR>musician in my generation to appreciate. Along with soulful crooners such as Brian McKnight, Justin Tinberlake, Jason Mrasz and the lead singer of Maroon5- Gavin pushes the envelope daring to blend all styles of music with harmony and craft. <BR>This CD rocks!
B000031WD9|1.0|y r teen comedies always funny??? maybe adults just like it for no reason. this is not funny at all! its stupid no COMEDY!!! its just a nasty movie. if u like nasty comedy watch but really i did not laugh. really these moviues r rarely funny.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Unbelievable album, bought it first day. These guys are really taking music in a new direction as opposed to all the LINKIN PARK carbon copies. I like every song. Similar style to their first album. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Who expected this film could match the first one?  The filmaking techniques are similar, but this movie has a different feel from the first, just as each of the stages in Tolkien's epic have an evolving sense of impending doom mixed with hints of hope.  As most readers know, some details of the book have been changed.  Even so, the film is very faithful to the book and even fleshes out some aspects of the story.  I like the widesreen version best and the extras are nice too.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I just wanted to say that Chicago is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I really recommend you see it. It has glitz &amp; glamour and its has funny elements. The singing and dancing is wonderful and the songs are great. I've watched it at least a million times and Renee Zellweger is great at Roxie and is one of the best actresses! Catherine Zeta Jones also does awesome as Velma. :-D
B000063DFQ|5.0|Piece of mind blew me away the first time I listened to it, and it still does to this day.  Truly one of the best albums ever made by any band. I still think that Powerslave has a slight edge over this one, but not by much.  This is a must have for anybody who knows what good music is. <br />1) Where Eagles Dare<BR>They seriously couldn't have started this album off in a better way.  &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;  is a fast, riff ladened song with great lyrics and haunting melodies.  One of the best songs on the album, which says alot considering there are so many classics here. A+<br />2) Revelations<BR>One of the many things I've admired about Iron Maiden all these years is that they continue to surprise me with their songs.  This one is no exception.  It starts off very slow and melodic, and then out of nowhere comes a riff that shifts the gears of the song, and it becomes a very fast paced, heavy rocker.  Great lyrics too.  A+<br />3)Flight of Icarus<BR>A big hit for the band.  As good as this song is, I like some of the other songs on this album alot more.  Still, this is classic stuff right here.  A<br />4)Die With Your Boots On<BR>Yet another big hit for the band.  This song just flat out rocks.  It's not the most complex song they've written and performed, but this is so classic, it's impossible not to love.  The music throughout the song is excellent as always, and Bruce's singing style really fits the sound perfectly.  The chorus is so catchy, it'll stay with you always.  A+<br />5) The Trooper<BR>I don't even really need to rate this one.  My favorite on the album, and one of my favorites of all time. It's impossible to describe how amazing this song is.  The riff still gives me chills everytime I listen to it.  The lyrics are very dark and visual.  You can almost see the battlefield described in the song.  A++<br />6) Still Life<BR>Another pleasant surprise.  I love how the mood changed with this song.  Extremely melodic and beautiful to listen to.  Chorus is very catchy.  This song sounds like it would fit very well on Somewhere in Time, but I'm glad it's on this one.   Not as heavy as the song that came before it, but no less enjoyable.  I don't understand how some people think this is a weak song.  A+<br />7) Quest for Fire<BR>Well, here's the big argumentative question about this album.  Is this filler or is it not filler? I wouldn't necessarily call it filler, but it's definitely the weakest song on the album.  I read a review here that said this one was better than the Trooper....get real.  This is by no means a bad song, there are no bad Iron Maiden songs (on this album at least), this one just doesn't stand up with all the other incredible songs here.  I like the solo however, so I'll give this song a B+.<br />8) Sun and Steel<BR>Don't put this in the same category as Quest for Fire.  This happens to be a great song.  For some reason, in some parts of the song I'm reminded a little of Black Sabbath's sound during the Dio years.  It's very well paced with one of the best choruses on the album.  A<br />9) To Tame A Land<BR>They had the perfect beginning to the album, and they had the perfect end to the album!  This extremely well made song is the longest of all the tracks on Piece of Mind, and has a very epic feel to it.  With tempo changes that always surprise you, amazing guitar work, and hauntingly dark melodies,  this ends up being one of the best songs on the album. A+<br />I rank Piece of Mind above Number of the Beast, and slightly below Powerslave.  I still recommend anyone new to Iron Maiden to start off with Number of the Beast and work forward.  Make Piece of Mind your second purchase, and enjoy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I think Radiohead have yet again achieved another goal. Just about everysong on this album is brilliant. the only critisism here is that it doesnt quite hold together the way &quot;Kid A&quot; or &quot; OK Computer&quot; do. Nevertheless, there are unending strokes of genius on this album. some of the layering of sounds used in &quot;Mxymatosis&quot; and &quot;Wolf at the Door&quot; just leaves me in awe. &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; is just a flat out heartbreaking song. &quot;There There&quot; and &quot;Sit down. Stand Up&quot; are filled with such an intense musical angst that is so effective it makes you wanna jump out of your skin. And overall, like always, Radioheads music is constantly complex and beautiful and Thom's voice is in other relm that i dont think anyone else can come near (especially on this album). They are without a doubt the greatest band of the last 20 years, and quite possibly one of the best ever.
0451191153|5.0|The depth and inner conflicts of rand's characters creates a fluidly readable and purposeful novel.  The philos of the characters and the plot weaves into a intricate tapestry of chalenging interactions, between the ego of the architect and public opinion. A subtle contrast is also created between the depth and scale of domonique's persona ans the relative complex simplicity of howard roark. this book is an icon of publishing and has inspired many young architects and thinkers alike.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Another brilliant piece of artwork by Tool frontman, Maynard James Keenan, and Billy Howerdel. &quot;The Thirteenth Step&quot; draws attention to peaceful music. Not a far cry from the first outing, &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; , but it definately holds it's own in significance. This beautiful music eases the listeners state of mind and in turn leaves them with a sense of euphoria. Stating the names of the great songs of this album would do it a great injustice. This entire work is incredibly brilliant.
B00004U2GH|5.0|The 1969 live album &quot;At San Quentin&quot; is unquestionably the definitive recording of Johnny Cash during his &quot;wild&quot; years, although I have to admit a personal preference for the songs and performances captured the year before on &quot;At Folsom Prison.&quot;  That album had made Cash a recognizable star even to people who did not listen to Country music and &quot;At San Quentin&quot; catapulted him to the highest level as a recording artist.  What remains constant is Cash's ability to feed off of his captive audience.  When he plays to these prisoners you do not doubt for a second that he is one of them, a larger than life outlaw, even though the only time he spent behind bars was in a drunk tank.  Cash is clearly on the edge as he rips his way through jailhouse ballads (&quot;Starkville City Jail,&quot; &quot;San Quentin&quot;), rockabilly songs (&quot;Big River&quot;), and old hits (&quot;I Walk the Line,&quot; &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;).  But it is when Cash sings &quot;A Boy Named Sue,&quot; a song written by Shel Silverstein, that he shows his absolutely mastery (the rest of us were just shocked by a hit record with a &quot;bleep&quot; on it).<br />This was a legendary album for decades and now this 2000 reissue literally doubles its length, from nine to eighteen tracks providing, as the cover proudly proclaims, the complete February 1969 concert.  One of the &quot;new&quot; tracks is the other hit single that came off the album, &quot;Daddy Sang Bass.&quot;  But it is still totally amazing that you can take a definitive album by a major figure in modern American music and make it twice as long (imagine that being the case with any other great album from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; to &quot;Nevermind&quot;; it blows your mind).  There are a handful of albums that you should be checking out, if you do not already own them, to appreciate the Man in Black and his music and &quot;At San Quentin&quot; has to be one of the fingers you would tick off on the first hand you used.  Johnny Cash, with his resonant baritone and distinctive sound, was one of the most imposing figures in country music in our lifetime and it is nice to know that when he died this past week that he was appreciated by even the most recent generation of music lovers.the first hand you used.

B000002NZO|5.0|&quot;trespass&quot; is one of my all-time favourite Genesis album.<BR>all tracks have a dream-like atmosphere,&quot;Looking for someone&quot; is a real gem here - Peter Gabriel's vocals,great piano works and amazing bass line (Mike Rutheford shines on whole album) arew making &quot;looking for someone&quot; one of hteir best tracks from Gabriel era.<BR>the rest of the album is great too, especially &quot;White mountain&quot; and classic rocker &quot;the knife&quot;.<BR>definitly it is one of the best genesis albums ever made!
B00006312A|5.0|Johnny Cash was a legendary figure of American music who often seemed the embodiment of an prophet from the Old Testament (and not one of the happier ones at that).  With his passing there is a natural impulse to want to listen to the man and his music, but we really should resist the impulse to take the easy way out and listen to one of the greatest hits collections of The Man in Black (after all, the first Johnny Cash hits album came out forty years ago).  Instead you track done one of the superb albums that he put out during his music career.  From that perspective &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; and &quot;At San Quentin&quot; are the two quintessential Johnny Cash albums from what ended up being the &quot;early&quot; part of one of the great careers in American music.  Both albums were recorded live in front of eager audiences of prison inmates in the late 1960s and provide ample proof of why Cash was one of the most imposing and influential figures in country music.  &quot;At San Quentin&quot; represents Cash at his wildest, but I think &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; offers up the better songs and stronger performances.<br />Part of the reason this is such a great album is because Cash clearly plays to his audience, singing songs about prison, crime and murder, loss and regret, mother and God, and most importantly loneliness.  There is no sugarcoating of the harsh realities of prison life in these songs as Cash sings the songs of the gospel of darkness and rage.  Cash's singing is truly authentic (you can feel him feeding off of his audience) and the result is compelling cathartic.  This is not an album filled with hits although there are certainly several recognizable songs: &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; &quot;Jackson,&quot; and &quot;I Still Miss Someone.&quot;  But it will be the ones you might never have heard before, such as &quot;I Got Stripes,&quot; that stand out in your mind after listening to the album.  This was already a 5 star album, but now the entire concert is available on CD adding three previously unreleased tracks: &quot;Busted,&quot; &quot;Joe Bean,&quot; and &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer.&quot;  &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; is an essential Johnny Cash album and if you own just two Johnny Cash CDs I would pick this one and 1994's &quot;American Recording.&quot;  They will surely give you the measure of the Man in Black and his music.tire concert is available on CD adding three previously unreleased tracks: &quot;Busted,&quot; &quot;Joe Bean,&quot; and &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer.&quot;  &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; is an essential Johnny Cash album and if you own just two Johnny Cash CDs I would pick this one and 1994's &quot;American Recording.&quot;  They will surely give you the measure of the Man in Black and his music.
B000035Z3K|5.0|As far as three generations of horror fans are concerned, Bela Lugosi was &quot;Dracula.&quot; The original talkie version of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) is a showcase of Bela's formidible acting skills and powerful stage presence. Even though he learned much of his dialogue phonetically, his mannerisms and intonations were right on target. Not only in &quot;Dracula,&quot; but in virtually all his movies whenever he enters a scene it becomes his---no matter who his co-stars may be. Most horror fans know the tale of how Lugosi turned down the role of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; because he believed such a made-up, non-talking role was beneath his aristocratic bearing and thespian abilities. To a certain degree, Bela was correct. The Frankenstein monster as originally concieved for film by director Robert Florey was a lumbering, grunting monstrousity that did seem beneath the regal Lugosi's dignity. But it was poor timing on Bela's part to assert his ego. In his stead, an unknown British truck driver-turned-actor named William Henry Pratt assumed the role and went on to great fame as &quot;Boris Karloff.&quot; Karloff essayed the role of the monster despite the fact that he and newly assigned director James Whale never hit it off. On the other hand, Universal never forgave Bela for turning down the role and for asserting his fiery independence. Bela continued with Universal Studios through the mid-1930s and made some genuine classics like &quot;Murders In The Rue Morgue (1932),&quot; &quot;The Black Cat (1933),&quot; &quot;The Raven (1934),&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Ray (1936),&quot; the latter three with Karloff as his co-star. He even made the cult classic &quot;White Zombie&quot; for the Halpern Brothers in 1932. But by the late 1930s Karloff had surpassed Lugosi as the horror meister, as the former actor's superior language skills enabled him to assume more and better roles from Universal as well as from other studios. Conversely, Lugosi began a string of poverty row films; and despite a few great performances like &quot;The Human Monster&quot; in 1939, Lugosi was forced to take scripts that were indeed beneath his talent and his dignity. Late in 1939, however, the great director Rowland Lee felt sorry for Bela and built up an otherwise secondary role for Bela in &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; as the deranged hunchback &quot;Igor.&quot; Lee's faith in Bela was well rewarded as the great European stage actor turned in a remarkable performance that literally stole the show from Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, and Lionel Atwill. Lugosi's &quot;Igor&quot; is now considered, like his &quot;Dracula,&quot; one of the immortal horror characters of all time. So good, in fact, was Bela's performance that when Universal decided to do another &quot;Frankenstein&quot; sequel called &quot;Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; in 1942, Bela's &quot;Igor&quot; was the centerpiece of the film. Despite this welcome respite, Bela again returned to lesser roles as he still had not mastered the English language even as late as two decades after his arrival in America. In part, this was Bela's own fault since he socialized almost exclusively with fellow Hungarian-Americans like Victor Varconi, Michael Curtiz, and Paul Lucas. His linguistic limitations stereotyped him in mad scientist roles in which his Central European accent fit well. But Bela's choices of roles were far more restricted than those of Karloff. By the late 1940s Bela was again relegated to poverty row productions, and his addiction to painkillers from the early 1940s on (originally prescribed for a painful back injury) only made matters worse. As the 1950s rolled around he was forced to take B movie roles for miserly financial remuneration, and after an emaciated Lugosi courageously spent time in a drug rehabilitation clinic, he died in 1956 literally penniless. Ironically, Bela's legend grew in leaps and bounds after his death to the point where today his memorabilia outsells that of his rival Karloff by two to one. Critics now unanimously agree that Bela's stage presence was far superior to that of Karloff; and while Karloff's comfortability with the English language enabled him to play a more eclectic range of characters, Lugosi more than held his own despite the language barrier. Bela's star is firmly ensconced at the forefront of the Horror Hall of Fame right next to that of Boris.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|For me, when Bowie made good music it was the tonal shades in his music and the emotions conveyed by voice that pulled it off. His lyrics did not have to be perfect for the song to work. <br />When Heathen came out, I knew the wait was worth it. Since Scary Monsters, I wondered what happened to Bowie. Maybe he was too happy with life? Earthling was interesting but Reeves guitar work was always irritating. Heathen was Bowie back in form.<br />Reality continues where Heathen left of. A bit more experimentation and a bit more edgy.<br />Maybe this album is not for everyone. But if you have ever enjoyed David Bowie this album is for you.
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy's book &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; brings us a new view of a culture and people we know very little about.  Her careful orchestration of words and plot will guide us through a very complex and misunderstood period (the socialist upheaval of the 60s in India), while confronting us with a hard and shocking clash between past and present.  How can children understand what is ingrained in their parents and grandparents, without being taught how to see as they see?  The children in her novel are brought to a place and time when the culture of this ancient nation is being tried and rejected by young people influenced by the urgency of the times, and the external bombardment of western values and culture.<br />A must read for students of cultures and philosophy.  A. Roy is an insightful and generous writer, who puts all our fears and doubts on the table, where you can see them and face them.
0385504209|5.0|I went to the house of my girlfriend's parents, and her mother had this book in the visitors room. I started reading it, and after a while I just could not let go of it. Her mother decided to go out and buy it for me after seeing how much I liked the book. I am not an avid reader and it is probably because I never read books as good as this. I fully recommend this one.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Wow.  If you can listen to this cd and not be overwhelmed by a cacophony of emotions, perhaps you don't have a heart!  Perhaps, like me, you will realize what a true American gem Johnny Cash was.  He really was an icon, a legend, the last of a dying (literally) breed. <br />This cd is a selection of very obvious personal selections and themes.  Imagine burning a cd to leave behind for your family and loved ones, a cd that would encapsulate who you are/were and articulate the messages you would want to remain.  This is American IV: The Man Comes Around.<br />The first track, The Man Comes Around, is an incredible song and is worth the price of the cd alone.  But that's just the beginning.  By now, you've probably seen the video and heard the hype about the cover of the Nine Inch Nails' `Hurt'.  This song, when sung by Johnny Cash, is given incredible depth.  No longer a whiny \\"life-is-so-hard-I'm-gonna-jab-a-needle-in-my-arm\\" mantra, it is transformed into \\"I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm ready\\"...diabetes and other health problems has taken its toll.  \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" was never one of my favorite songs, but while hearing this version, I was overwhelmed by the beauty of this song...not the singing itself, because Johnny's voice is also failing him, but by the sincerity with which it is sung.  The same is true for \\"First Time, Ever I Saw Your Face\\", and the Lennon/McCartney gem, \\"In My Life\\"...just beautifully meaningful, with a whole new context, because we know how closely bonded he and his wife, June Carter, were, even after 30 years of marriage.  Throughout the cd you will hear glimpses of a funereal-sounding organ, and it always makes you realize where he was coming from with these song selections.  The closing song, \\"We'll Meet Again\\" proves that point.<br />Even if you are pretty darn sure Johnny Cash is not your cup of tea, listening to this might very well help you to realize why this man and his inimitable method/style continues to impact the songwriters of today.  Sleep well, Mr. Cash, and thank you for sharing with us.
6300213668|5.0|Grease is so much fun to watch! It really takes you back to when everybody had no cares in the world, and when everything is so diffrent then now!<br />  The music and dancing is awesome, and the outfits are so from back then.<br />  I hope that this helps you when you are trying to pick out a fun, fun movie!=)
6304806442|5.0|I'd like to begin this review with my pre-viewing expectations - - ZILCH!  I had never heard of this movie, had not viewed the trailer or read the box, I just sat down on my sofa as my husband pressed \\"play\\" on the remote and jumped right in with both feet.  The first few minutes made me squirm, I was thinking \\"oh no, a movie glorifying drugs, with lots of F-words and thick accents\\", but the narration of the main character, Mark Renton, was intellectually stimulating, so I listened more closely and allowed myself to become immersed in the story.  The characters in this story are ugly, heroin-addicted losers, but they are portrayed as very real people - - yes, they are bad, but they are not evil.  Their lives are extremely grim and repugnant.  I've always wondered how people addicted to heroin can live their lives thinking they are living normally, and the addiction is so powerful it renders them powerless to live any other way, but then I realized almost anything can be considered an addiction - - we all wrestle with something, be it our weight, our ethics, our punctuality, etc..  Moments when we convince ourselves it will be the last time, until the next time.<br />The film makes some interesting comparisons between a \\"normal\\" life, and the twisted lives of these characters.  You notice small hypocrisies, such as the friend in the pub railing against drug use, while he obviously has an alcohol and an anger-management problem.  This film also addresses the issues of loyalty, culture, politics - - with some scathing commentary on consumerism and capitalism - - and some digs at the \\"Just Say No\\" and \\"Choose Life\\" rallying cries.  I particularly liked the ending - - there were no sweeping revelations for the characters, they remained true to their weaknesses, true to their characters.<br />There are plenty of sad, sick moments, and there are some very funny moments, even through the darkness, and the wit of each character is fantastic.  Some of the most imaginative sequences I enjoyed immensely, but felt as though they could've done without the extremism and still kept a good flowing story.  Still, they certainly made a strong point in the scene involving the most disgusting toilet in Scotland.  As for the dialogue, I am going to have to watch it again, just to make sure I caught it all.  My husband and I finally admitted we weren't understanding the dialogue as fully as we would've liked, so we switched to the \\"hearing-impaired\\" sub-titles about 30 minutes into the film.  The Scottish accents are the thickest!  <br />The acting is terrific, across the board.  I was shocked - - just flabbergasted! - - as the film ended and I saw Ewan McGregor was Mark Renton!  He looked so gaunt and ill, not the charming and handsome Ewan McGregor of 'Moulin Rouge'!  <br />Definitely not a movie for the kids, 'Trainspotting' is a film everyone should see once, even if the topic is unsettling.  Plus, I give it extra stars for utilizing my favorite descriptive noun - - \\"wanker\\".  I also appreciated the integration of Iggy Pop's song \\"Lust for Life\\", knowing that it was written after Iggy had kicked his heroin habit and had a newfound lust for life.  I'm just glad to hear that song used anywhere other than car commercials!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|If it weren't for Bruce Dickinson, I would have considered this album a failure. However, it's very good, despite some compositional imperfections. I would blame Harris for the bad arrangements of the songs: how could you spoil so many beautiful tunes by arranging them in excessive repetition? This makes them boring. <BR>Here are my comments on the track list, one by one:<br />1. Wildest Dreams<BR>Very nice song, typical for Smith. Normally, it is the one that is set for commercial success and gaining new fans and approval from a wider range of people. Serves its purpose well!<br />2. Rainmaker<BR>This one, as a number of other songs on this album, reminds a little bit of Bruce's solo career, but it keeps its overall Maiden flavour. Melodic, without any effects on the voice which is nice in this particular case.<br />3. No More Lies<BR>This is what I was talking about! It starts beautifully, with a wonderful tune, and all of a sudden - a heavy, thunderous chorus, sung perfectly, but repeated 8 times on the first chorus! Cut it in half, Steve, and have it 8 times on the second!<br />4. Montsegur<BR>Best song on the album! I see it as a live favourite in the future. Gers proves his writing abilities one more time. Heavy song, this is how devoted fans want Iron Maiden to sound!<br />5. Dance of Death<BR>Second favourite on [...] voting board. Title song deserves good words. Bruce gives his best; proves for a millionth time that he's the best HM singer ever! However, towards the end it becomes boring, and it's all Harris' fault!<br />6. Gates of Tomorrow<BR>Least favourite on the voting board; it would suit bands like Aerosmith or Guns `N' Roses better. Trivial and predictive, but it's been performed pretty well. This is where you can tell what huge difference there is between Maiden and the above-mentioned bands, in favour of Maiden, of course!<br />7. New Frontier<BR>A typical Maiden song from the classic period. Sounds very much like a song from `The Number of the Beast.' However, I've got no idea what part of the song exactly Nicko McBrain has written, because to me this is a 100% Smith's song.<br />8.Paschendale<BR>The highest rated song on the voting chart is a disappointment to me. Surely, the tune is nice and aggressive, but too simple. Bruce makes it fine with his powerful vocals.<br />9. Face in the Sand<BR>Nothing special but it carries the spirit of Maiden and that makes it valuable.<br />10. Age of Innocence <BR>A brave innovative attempt! This is what Bruce made with his solo career several years ago and succeeded. It's time for Maiden now to try something new; it costs them nothing, since there are so many other good songs.<br />11. Journeyman<BR>This one is even braver in terms of presenting something unexpected. It should be given the credit only for the fact that it is the first Maiden song ever in which no distorted guitar has been used from the beginning to the end of it. No solo, either! It is very soft and relaxing. Shifts so smoothly from minor to major. Those who like Bruce's solo career are going to love it! Guaranteed! <br />Briefly, Maiden have put out another good album as expected by many. I am very excited about it; my eager anticipation was worth it! UP THE IRONS!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you haven't picked up this cd you should go and get it.  This album is way better then the first one.  The music is orchestrated way better then Mer de Noms and it all fits in together perfectly.  Remember this band is not Tool, so don't be expecting anything similar from them except the singer's voice.  I gave this album a five because the music is beautiful and is not the same as tons of other bands that copy each other.  A Perfect Circle is as unique as Tool, maybe it's because of Maynard.  Please go and pick up this cd you won't be disappointed.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is absolutely the best book that I've read this year.

6304806426|5.0|The English Patient took its rightful place as my favorite movie when I first saw it in 1997 (I wish I had caught it in theaters). It is only after reading some of the other reviews of this film posted online that I chose to write a review. People deserve to know the facts, and many of these reviews seem completely misinformed. <br />Any reviewer who talks about &quot;some boring English guy&quot; obviously never made it through to the end of the movie. Almasy is NOT English, and that is woven throughout the film as a mystery of his true identity and the heart-breaking irony (revealed at the end) that he was called &quot;The English Patient&quot;. <br />The complaints about the length of this film are ridiculous - it's long, yes, but not as long as other renowned classics like Gone with the Wind or Lawrence of Arabia. And the pace of The English Patient will only seem slow to someone who desires nothing more than quick entertainment with no thought required. This film is a Best Picture Oscar winner!!! It's not supposed to give you a quick jolt of Hollywood glitz! <br />Reviewers that tell you to watch this only once and then to not waste the time again are in the same group as those who tell you that the plot was confusing and hard to follow. Every time I watch this movie I get something new out of it. Some new bit of information clicks, some scene makes sense in a new context.<BR>If you want to catch all the wonderful intricacies of the plot, watch it over and over again. <br />And finally, for the many reviewers who seemed to consider the characters non-human and unapproachable and the story nothing more than recycled sentimental garbage, they missed a lot of the magic of this film. This ending never fails to make me cry, and the emotional range of the actors is incredible. And yes, it's a romance, so perhaps the man is too good to be true, and perhaps the woman is too lustful to be believable, but that's what films are all about. And as far as that particular media goes, I find The English Patient to be near perfection.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This has got to be one of the crowning atrocities in teeny-bopper, chick-flick cinema.  A movie comes out, consists of three hours of cheesy love drama and camera shots of Leonardo DiCaprio's face, and suddenly teenage girls around the world rise to a frenzy sufficient to earn this movie $1 billion and make everyone proclaim it's a masterpiece?  Something's not right here.  This doesn't prove it's a masterpiece or even a good film.  If anything, it just proves that a pretty face sells to teeny-bopper girls.  Next they'll be declaring the Backstreet Boys one of the best bands ever.<br />Aside from turning this tragic event (which is depicted well in the foolishness of the captain) into the backdrop for his stupid romance, James Cameron has taken all the focus off of what it should be on.  The sinking of the Titanic was a tragedy, and the memory of it should not be so infamously defaced as it was by this horrible movie.  After 2 hours of such a horrible love story and utterly uninteresting plot, I was actually CHEERING for the boat to sink, just so the movie would end.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I love this cd!!  I have been listening to it nonstop since I got it!!  It reminds me of the music I listened to on Vassar College radio in high school.  In a weird way, some of the riffs on the slower songs remind me of Joy Division (for example, the song &quot;Hard to Explain&quot;).  Other songs remind me of old songs from The Fall.  But other than that, it's hard to pin them down.  Every song on this CD is as good as the next!  It rocks.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I heard Dido for the first time in Emenem's Stan and then in the title track of 'Roswell' and what do I say... I was hooked! This is the best album to put on in the middle of the night and listen to... the only album I have that captures a certain mood, a kind of feeling you get during Dusk! Must buy for any music lover!
B000002VTE|5.0|Definitely a love 'em or hate 'em band, Spiritualized transcends modern music in this epic opera of lost love, addiction as a means of forgetting and finally acceptance and redemption. Jason Pierce (a.k.a. J. Spaceman) writes and produces each individual note on the entire album, which is no small feat given the vast array of sound and style. His music is melodic and complex without being too pretentious, but it's his brilliant lyrics that truly set him apart from a thick ocean of artists like Radiohead and Verve. So turn off the lights, put on some headphones and get comfortable. It opens up with the airy title track that bleeds into an injection of adrenaline and bounces back and forth between moments of primal rage, lust and loss. \\"I Think I'm in Love\\" starts with a dreamy swirl of sound taking the listener through a heroin injection before seemlessly switching into a quicker paced series of contradictory dialogue - \\"I think I'm in love...maybe you're just lonely\\" truly one of the highlights of the album. For anyone who's ever truly been in love and abruptly dumped this album speaks like a support group. If you've ever drank to forget it almost sounds like words you wish you'd written first, \\"sometimes I have my breakfast right off of a mirror - or sometimes I'll have it right out of a bottle\\" - Home of the Brave. The real highlight of the album though is in it's emotional abyss, \\"Broken Heart\\" - a song so desperately honest it hurts to listen to. He doesn't try to get clever or academically poetic with the lyrics - it's too emotional for that he just hits you with the straight shot \\"Lord, I have a broken heart...and I'm cryin' all the time.\\" the lyrics are accompanied by a sweeping set of strings that seem to lull you to the brink of tired as you become emotionally spent. Then after you take a deep sigh and catch your breath, church bells ring and after some horns come in you are led to the beautiful \\"Cool Waves\\" which could really be the end of the album rightthere. But, it's not. The bluesy and sinister Cop Shoot Cop takes you out. At well over 13 minutes this song carries you back slowly to where you started and when you turn on the lights and turn off the cd player you're amazed that everything you just went through came from 70 minutes of music. <BR>It's not for everyone though, people with a less patient ear won't appreciate the intricacies of the sounds or the lyrics and may even take a few turns to really get into it - but once you do it'll be like nothing you have ever heard or experienced before and all you'll ask yourself is: \\"How the hell did I go this long without even knowing that this masterpiece existed?\\"
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|APC again comes out with yet another well done CD. its still to early for me to deceide which one is better. I have listened to it 3 times so far since ive gotten it. If you liked the first APC cd (Mer De Noms), then you should definetly pick this one up. i waited a while for it, and let me tell you it was worth the wait. there are 1 or 2 songs that i thought though, they could of done a better job with, but it still overeall very well donw. pick this cd up, you wont be disappointed.<br />JOHN
B0000BYM3K|2.0|this is not as good as brave new world. it is very repetitive. too many songs sound like the ones from last album. don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good songs, but not nearly enough to call it a success.
B0000057C5|5.0|This album is over all very heavy and dark but it reaches its peak in the song '' Klavier '', which I think is the bands best song ever. This album screams potential, but I doubt they will ever do any better.  wish i could see them live.
078062565X|5.0|Even 70 years later, King Kong, better than any film ever made, points out the basic drawbacks to modern democracy: Ultimately, we all want to be ruled by a benevolent king who understands our needs perhaps even better than we do ourselves. The tragedy of King Kong is that all too often we don't realize this until it is far too late.<br />This is certainly the case for Kong, an obvious metaphor for many of history's tragic kings. The great ruler fights off a T-Rex, a giant snake, and a pterodactyl, protecting all of humanity from horrors against which it certainly could not adequately defend itself. Unfortunately, much like the British threw Churchill out of office not long after he valiantly led them through World War II, the humans in King Kong destroy the regal beast over a misunderstanding about his intentions toward Fay Wray. I especially liked the symbolism of Kong making his last stand from the top of the Empire State Building, representing the great heights to which Napolean, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and others reached before their ultimate downfalls.<br />This movie is highly recommended for anyone who is a student of great civilizations and the powerful rulers that led them.
B000021YQV|2.0|This is a band that i have mixed feelings about as im sure alot of other people do. Soad actracts alot of people with their unorthodox style, but i think they will fail in trying to put a human face on their musik. I like the choppy beats and riffs mixed with a whole bunch of other [stuff], but the more they try to shove their politics down other people's throats the more i cant stand them. If your a kid who just likes some hardcore pop rock that is a bit more edgy then alot of  the mainstream pop out there then youll love this album for a long time, but if you are looking for a band with skill that will constantly supply you with fresher musik then youll be dissapointed. I think that overall system of a down is a bunch of off beat losers who stylishly substitute awkwardness for musical ability. This band has alot of potential that is sufficated by an overall negative anti-american message that im sure most people don't catch. This is a group that needs to focus less on making things seem hardcore and humane at the sametime and just use the natural sound they have to progress their style into something more simple. Songs like ''Deer Dance'' are an example of what they can accomplish if they stop acting like bad speed metal imitators.
B00000JYGX|5.0|This work is a must have. I first knew the musical &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot; in the early of 2001 but don't have any time to listen to the CD or watch the DVD until a few days ago. In fact I'm quite familiar with the story by Hugo, still I cried several times while watching. It's not because of the story itself, but the music. I don't know why but I just cannot help my tears.<BR> This musical is called &quot;the very best of the four legendary musicals of France&quot;. It is also a milestone for breaking through the performance limit set by Lloyd Weber's musicals (which was in the 1980s by his &quot;CATS&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;). You will know this when you watch the DVD.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is beautiful, to say the least. It's not Mer De Nom Pt.2, but it's still amazing to hear. How the band has grown over the last couple of years to make this album is definetely worth your money!! And the new line-up include James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins) and Jeordie White ( Marilyn Manson; formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez). I wouldn't be here telling you to go buy it if it wasn't worth it, but this cd definetely is!!All the songs are unique in their own, dark ways. And Maynard's voice is still as mesmerizing as EVER!! A definite &quot;best of 2003&quot; album to have!!
B000089CJI|4.0|Its nice to see an album like this every once in a while. This is pure unadultered pop in a time where artists are taking themselves entirely too seriously. I was hooked from the moment Ben's voice enters the first track. Unfortunately, instead of using \\"District\\" as a launching point for album of perfect pop, the band sort of backs off for a couple of songs. The next for songs are a mess of fourth grade poetry lyrics and by the numbers electronica. Silhouettes and Brand New Colony are remenicent of the first track and are both completely brilliant. Natural Anthem seems like it would be more at home on the last DNTEL album but is good none the less. In the end, this adds up to 3 great songs 6 good ones, and one thats not too good (the first single \\"such great heights\\") which is well worth whatever theyre asking for this album.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a movie that gets better with age and repeated viewings.  The first time I saw it, the repetition was a bit annoying, but after seeing it a few times I came to appreciate the subtlety and comic genius.  The transformation of Bill Murray's character is fun to watch, as are his attempts to recapture moments from one day to the next. What was spontaneous one day is forced as he tries to relive it again.  The fact that he remembers each day makes him think he is immortal!<br />What a great concept!  What would you do if you lived the same day over and over again?  Whatever can happen, does happen.  Bill Murray is truly excellent in one of his under-rated roles.  The range of emotions he goes through is hysterical.  After what are likely hundreds of the same day in a row, Murray flips out a bit, and as a result his short sarcastic newscasts will have you rolling.<br />This is a comedy classic.  Buy it and watch it often, it keeps getting better!  Good values, great acting, and a wonderfully funny premise for the whole family.  Highly recommended!
B000002UAX|5.0|Disjointed? Unorganized? No sense of dynamic?<br />This is the most influential collection of songs in the history of rock. Sgt. Peppers did much to kick start the whole idea of concept albums (tightly held together with a consistent sound and atmosphere). In typical Beatles fashion, they blew that very concept apart in their next breath with The White Album.<br />These are some of the most timeless songs ever recorded. They are ingredients to great rock music - the riffs, the pace, the tempo, the way one track flows into the next effortlessly (not intended?) only goes to show the musical vision that's been developing between the Fab Four over the years (ironic considering this is a time when they were beginning to go their separate ways), and George Martin's genius behind the mixing board.<br />Out of all their albums, this has got to be my favorite.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|But it had to be done. I *really* like this album, but I can only give it 3 stars only because I just don't think it has the same impact as \\"Brave New World\\" does. That album was climactic in many ways with the rejoining of Dickinson; this one just did not have the same momentum coming into production. The songwriting is good on \\"Dance of Death\\", just more subtle. The choruses do not stand out as much as in previous albums. In fact, there are two songs that are somewhat indistinguishable because their structures are very similar and the mood very much the same. HOWEVER...this album sounds very symphonic at times, which means the band is coming to different terms with their three-guitar line-up and utilizing them in different ways by joining them with classical strings. Refer to certain mid points in songs like \\"Dance of Death\\" for examples. I like that aspect.<br />But...I have to say, in contrast to what a previous reviewer wrote, that the best song on the album IS the epic \\"Paschendale.\\" There's something about it that makes you wish they had stayed along those lines and written the rest of the album like that. Not necessarily length-wise, but definitely quality-wise. \\"No More Lies\\" definitely stands out there, as well as \\"Journeyman\\" just for the fact that its an ACOUSTIC MAIDEN SONG. When did you ever expect that to happen? Also, check out \\"Face in the Sand\\" even though I think it has the \\"Blood Brothers\\" feel going on in the beginning (And \\"Blood Brothers\\" in turn was reminiscent of \\"The Clansman\\" for me...). \\"Montsegur\\" is cool for its historic topic and hard drive. <br />All in all...I think this album is worth getting because it's definitely better than the other stuff that is out there right now. I won't name names but you know one band I am referring to. \\"Dance of Death\\" is NOT their worst album, by far. Also, with the advent of a possible Judas Priest/Iron Maiden live show in South America, (AND HOPEFULLY ALSO IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD!)EVERYONE has to make sure they can sing along to some of the new tunes!<br />Oh yea! The one gripe I have not come to terms with is the cover. It should've been drawn - or at least computer animated with more detail!!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's dreams are better than mine.  If this is what he saw when he closed his eyes, then I can understand how from that mind sprang the Seven Samurai and the rest.<br />&quot;Dreams&quot; is maybe the most personal, most &quot;Japanese&quot; of Kurosawa's films, and along with that it is perhaps the most difficult one for Western audiences to appreciate.  This is saying nothing against Western audiences, but many of the themes and myths on display may not be familiar, and the imagery and metaphors may be lost without the appropriate background.  I definitely appreciated it more after living in Japan, and becoming familiar with the countries folklore and literary story-telling style.  Hina Dolls, the Yuki Onna, the mountain villiges like islands of tradition amongst concrete modern Japan...<br />&quot;Dreams&quot; is beautiful, on a purely visual level.  The cinematography is exquisite and the colors and light are displayed with the eye of a painter.  It is appropriate that Van Gogh plays a role in one of the many dreams.  Like Van Gogh, the stories in &quot;Dreams&quot; are expressionistic and vivid, yet with the subdued emotions that is the hallmark of Japanese literature.  This is not the wild, raw statement of a younger Kurosawa.<br />Story-wise, the dreams play with the themes of death and loss, both human and of nature.  The displacement of Japanese forests, the lack of safety standards at nuclear power plants, the loss of traditional Japan, the pointless loss of lives in war...melancholy themes at best.  Yet at the end, hope is offered, in a small nook and cranny, like a flower blooming amongst concrete.<br />The DVD itself is a small disappointment, and I would rather have this belong to the Criterion Collection, but better to have it than not have it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is in stores today and the energy surrounding this album couldn't be any more intense. We're all so excited for this to finally be out for each of you to hear.<BR>Their first single is the greatly powerfull &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, it's just brilliant!.<br />&quot;Desperate and Ravenous<BR>I'm so weak and powerless over you.<BR>Pale angel go away<BR>Come again some other day<BR>The devil has my ear today<BR>I'll never hear of what you say<BR>Promised I would find a little solace<BR>And some piece of mind<BR>Whatever just as long as I don't feel so...&quot;
0375751513|5.0|I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up.  However, it is anything but!  This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.<br />Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray.  In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols.  A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas.  When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Before I watched \\"Smallville\\", I assumed there was no way for a WB made show to compete with the other aspects of the Superman franchise. Doubting \\"Smallville\\" was probably one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. In my opinion, it is the best show on TV right now, and one of the best that I have ever seen. The reason the show works, is because it takes an interesting look at the legend of Superman. You bare witness to the human side of the character - Clark Kent, growing up as a teenager in Smallville Kansas. Clark must adjust to his different powers, the relationship between Lex Luthor and Clark develops, and you see the classic romance between Clark and Lana Lang, who are destined to be just friends. Watching the two fight their feelings for each other, really provides for a great romance side to the show. <br />The show works for both Superman loyalists like myself, as well as fans who are new to the character in general. For the loyalists, the show sticks very close to the original story, and the special effects are outstanding when it comes to Clark's powers. For the people who are just starting out with Smallville, it still works, because it offers fresh young actors, entertaining episodes, and current hit music. Tom Welling is absolutely outstanding as Clark Kent, not only because he looks the part, but also because he acts with such intense emotion. You come to feel for what the character is going through. Kristin Kreuk is great as Lana Lang and is absolutely gorgeous! I am very happy that the producers are sticking a Lois Lane type character into the picture with Allison Mack who plays Chloe - the skeptical and news hungry editor of the school paper. John Glover hits the bullseye with his portrayal of Lionel Luther. Michael Rosenbaum is a good actor but I am still torn on his role of Lex Luthor. It is frustrating to see Lex and Clark as friends, when the two are destined to be enemies. The most surprising performances come from Anette O Toole and JohnSchneider who play Clark's parents. They both do an extremely good job and really capture the true essence of John and Martha Kent. <br />Smallville remains basically flawless in my eyes, and gets better every single week. The actors, entertaining episodes, and great music really make it a treat to watch. If you are not already watching the show, do yourself a favor and start as soon as you can!
B00005JKC3|4.0|Okay, I've never reviewed a product in my life. I chose this one to do a review of. That's how strongly I feel about this movie.<br />Okay, I'm a fan. As a kid, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" was the only comic I would read. Back in the day I wished for a \\"HULK\\" movie. Yes, the show was okay. As a kid it was enough, but still did not do the book justice. <br />Then came this movie. If you see this movie expecting all eye candy like what's delivered in Spider-Man or X-Men, you'll be disappointed. \\"The Hulk\\" is more than just a green man with anger issues. In order to do the character justice, the movie had to be done the way it was done. And the movie tells the Banner/Hulk story nearly perfectly. The dynamic between children and parents (father/son Banner; father/daughter Ross) is played out especially well. <br />Honestly, I can't understand the complaints leveled against this movie. If you want a popcorn movie, that fine! Watch \\"Tomb Raider.\\" If you want a movie that makes you think, watch \\"The Hulk.\\" To bash the movie the way some people are is not warranted. This coming from a guy who loves to rip apart Trek movies. If a movie is bad, believe me, I'd say so. <br />So why 4 instead of 5 stars? Well, the movie does have a few problems. For one thing, for the money spent on the CGI, I expected the Hulk to look a little better. There wasn't enough consistency in the CGI. One shot the Hulk looks real as could be while at other times he looks like a cartoon. And the fight scenes at night were too dark. I have no idea why they were made so dark, especially since the Hulk CGI looked so good in daylight.<br />Bottom line: If you want to see a thinking person's comic book movie, watch \\"The Hulk.\\"
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was waiting for this album for a while now.<br />It is beyond great as usual, they did an awesome job creating an album. All of the tracks are well made, and very well put together. Great creativity with no doubt.<br />Personal Favorite (Track) is &quot;The Noose&quot;<BR>Its beautifully made, Awesome Lyrics, A gloomy track but very powerful.<br />I was very lucky to get it so soon.<br />This is a Deffinant purchase, i suggest getting it when it comes out. :)
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|More mellow than Mer de Nomes, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is that album's sophisticated younger brother. <br />Maynard had more input on the music production this time, and he appears to be content to hold off on the bombast until he's good and ready. The wailing guitar payoffs on these tracks often take several minutes to arrive, which will no doubt frustrate some listeners and probably drive away even more of those Tool fans who screamed, &quot;PLAY JERK-OFF&quot; during the recent Lateralus tour.<br />For those who are willing to accept this album on its terms, an enjoyable experience awaits, particularly on the middle tracks of the album, which break new ground in the APC/Tool cannon. Yes folks, electric banjos make an appearance. Maynard continues to spiral out into new territory, and one hopes the fanbase will be willing to come along for the ride, the &quot;Jerk-off&quot; contingent of the Tool fanbase notwithstanding.<br />It should finally be mentioned that there are strands of &quot;The Cure&quot; running in the DNA of Thirteenth Step. Devotees of Robert Smith will find hooks to hang their hats on.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|My only complaints are that there are only 8 tracks (not counting the intro and outro) and there are no ballads. Everything is medium or fast paced. I absolutely love 7 out of 8, though. <br />This album has a little bit more of a hip-hop/R&amp;B flava and a little less of a jazz vibe than her previous albums. Whether that is good or bad depends on what you like. If you like &quot;An Ode to Hip-Hop (Love of My Life)&quot; then you will love this album. If you prefer the jazzier sound of her live album, you might be slightly disappointed, but you'll still like it.<br />I heard Erykah live at the Paramount in Denver in February 2002. She played &quot;Bump It&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot;, which happen to be my two favorites on this album. After hearing them just once live a year and a half ago, I haven't been able to get them out of my head. I have been eagerly anticipating this album since then and it doesn't disappoint. You will definitely love those two songs immediately.
1400034205|5.0|This book is a must for any young adult who is in a relationship, or is asking any questions about searching in life.  I feel that i was able to relate all of the characters in the book to someone I knew including myself.  It was an easy book to want to read on a friday night or the weekend.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I just saw this movie (screening) a few hours ago.  It is such a great movie.  I walked into the movie theater with no idea what the movie was about.   I left feeling so good.  This movie made me laugh and cry.  It also made me sad and happy.  It tells short stories of different people that are somehow connected but not really.  There is lots of love in this movie.  From family love to romance.  I have got to see this movie again as soon as it is released!  You must see this movie.  Wow!!!  I love this movie.  Did I mention that I love this movie?  Enjoy!!!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|1. The Package    <BR>Fairly good song. Far too average to open the CD with though. The intro is <br />mellow and a bit stark but the end picks up the heaviness.<BR>(7/10)<BR>    <BR>2. Weak And Powerless        <BR>Really good opening bassline. Overall, pretty good song. The only part that <br />isn't great is the chorus, but even then it's not too bad.<BR>(7/10)<br />3. The Noose    <BR>Great song. Mellow low-fi intro that unexpectadly shimmers to life after a bit. <br />Epic yet subdued.<BR>(9/10)<br />4. Blue       <br />Great guitars here. The chorus isn't anything amazing, but overall it's a great <br />song.<BR>(8/10)<BR> <BR>5. Vanishing        <BR>Mainly an instrumental song. Heavily reverbed vocals do show up in the <br />begining and end. Nothing special, yet fairly good too.<BR>(6/10)<br />6. A Stranger        <BR>Surprisingly good song. Starts off as nothing special. Just an acoustic guitar. <br />But the vocals are just inspiring when they come in. After a while a subsonic <br />bassline drives things in a new direction. Great song.<BR>(9/10)<br />7. The Outsider        <BR>THE best song APC has ever done. Similar to Judith as far as heaviness <br />goes, but this is much more aggressive and to the point. Nothing bad about it <br />at all.<BR>(11/10)<br />8. Crimes        <BR>Pointless instrumental filler.<BR>(1/10)<br />9. The Nurse Who Loved Me        <BR>? Seems to be more of a joke than an actual song. A happy sounding <br />fairy-tale like orchestra backs up airy vocals. Whatever... The original wasn't <br />that amazing either.<br />(2/10)<br />10. Pet        <BR>Great song. The intro guitar line is epic to say the least. Lots of dynamics. The <br />&quot;Swaying to the rhythm of the new world order&quot; line is powerful and will <br />send shivers down your spine. When I first heard this as an mp3 it sounded <br />like the vocals were put through a vocoder and I was a bit worried, but <br />listening to the album I can tell that it's just two vocal tracks that are similar in <br />volume. The only downfall is the bridge. Live it sounds great, but on the album <br />it just falls a bit flat.<BR>(8/10)<br />11. Lullaby        <BR>Not bad as a track like this goes. Nothing special though.<BR>(7/10)<br />12. Gravity<BR>Starts of as an average song, but one particular vocal line sent a fair <br />ammount of shivers down my spine and made this song shine.<BR>(8/10)<br />Average rating compiled from all the tracks: 7/10<BR>Not counting Crimes and TNWLM which I don't see myself ever listening to <br />again: 8/10   ...that's more like it. Great album overall
0064400557|5.0|Absolutely Wonderful Book!<BR>Charlotte's Web was written by E.B. White. It is the wonderful book that is about a young girl named Fern who befriends the pig named Wilbur. Fern is the one of the main characters in this story. She tries to save Wilbur' life from her father. Then Wilbur was sold to Mr. Zuckerman, her uncle who lives on the farm. While Wilbur stays at that farm, Fern always to visit and play with him every day after school. In that farm, he has many friends such as a rat named Templeton, and a friendly spider named Charlotte. Charlotte is a true friend to him that we can see from the story that she tries to save his life from Mr. Zuckerman, that he will kill Wilbur to be the food. Then she can save Wilbur' life and make him becomes popular by spin her web into the words that says about Wilbur such as \\"Some Pig\\" and \\"Terrible\\"<BR>These words cause him still a life and famous. There are many people that want to see him. The story is happy ending.<BR> This book is one of the great books that I ever read. It is the fantastic book that is about the animals that they can talk and understand in each other and also they can talk to a young girl. But in real life the animal and human can not talk with each other. This book is also about the true friendship that is pig (Wilbur) and a spider (Charlotte) that they are willing to do anything to each other. That we can see from Charlotte tries to do everything that will protect her friend from death. I think that if in one life we have the true friend that can do any thing to us an always to help and stand beside us when we have any problems, it will make us be happy forever.
B000002U9P|5.0|This 1986 Tina Turner release is one of her most underrated albums.  Her vocals are strong, yet melodic.  She has the unique ability not to just sing a song but emote feelings while relaying the lyrics.  Tina is gifted and truly original vocalist.  The best.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|More of a relaxing album than anything.  Something you smoke some greens to and just sit back and relax to maynards voice and billy's ambient guitars and the winding drums with the bass to make the band a complete sound.  I still think tool is a way more talented band than APC but anything maynard is involved in is great and therefore this cd is up there.  But all in all if u want a complete calm album this is it.  I listen to heavier rock usually but i can simmer down for this.
0066214122|4.0|This one rated four stars simply because it had me staying with it late at night to get to the ending.<br />It is about swarms of tiny robots, molecular robots, swarming around, and up to no good.<br />I bet you think the good guys will win in the end, the bad guys will die, the children will probably be alright.  The children in this book, I don't know if you root for them to be alright or to die a grisly death.  They are about the most annoying children I've ever seen in fiction.  You want to smack one of them, and the other one, well you want to smack that one too.<br />One thing I don't get.  The swarms of tiny robots can be blown away by a strong wind.  So why not attack them with battery-powered Vornado fans?  Or politicians.<br />In any event, the story gets quite silly when the swarms of molecular robots start taking the shape of the people in the story.  I guess it would get some oohs and aahs in the movies.  But it is ridiculous.<br />All in all, it is a knockoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
B00005NB8K|5.0|I loved this movie. Val Kilmer played a killer Jim Morrison...very impressive. Almost true to life.<BR>There were some slow parts but all in all this is a great movie!!
B00000K44W|5.0|I have been listening to JT since the debut of Benefit, and I have been entertained if not completely enthralled by their Tullian permutations over the years.  Heavy Horses does not pose itself as a \\"great\\" album in my mind, yet for some reason, it has stuck with me.  When I think of JT, I hear \\"Acres Wild,\\" \\"Moths,\\" and \\"One Brown Mouse.\\"  But it is the bittersweet paean to the Scottish Clydesdale that most claims my memory for representative Tull.  <br />This album is easily eclipsed by the boisterous inventions that precede it; Heavy Horses is neither surprising nor dazzling. It is, rather, a more temperate effort, and solid, much like the steadfast work horses Ian Anderson venerates. (This must have been recorded around the time of his captivation with salmon farming and the lifestyle of the landed gentry.)<br />I think that this album comes straight from Anderson's heart, and as such signifies the heart of Tull, the earthy pulse beat that perhaps underlies all of their other efforts; their solid core.  It would be easy to say the songs are merely filler for the title track, but the overall feeling of this album is too grounded to dismiss so lightly.<br />Stripped of sparkle and flash, Heavy Horses shimmers with a warm and folksy glow.  You might want to listen to this album after all the others are said and done, in a quiet time, sipping a glass of wine at the end of a hectic day when your appreciation of the old-fashioned value of perseverance is heightened and your appetite for the profound is satisfied in simply being.
B00005JL78|4.0|Tom Cruise \\"John\\"  sees dead people. But only BEFORE they are murdered, with the help of three seemingly vegatative precognitives. When John's precogs see into the future and predict HE will become a murderer, John finds himself the target of his own police force. Can John prove his own innocence, or is he destined to become a murderer?<br />I really enjoyed Minority Report. But I felt the plot was fairly predictable, and the ending was very contrived. I found it hard to believe that a seemingly somnambulant precog female was able to speak, talk, and interpret the sensory feedback she received after being contained within the 'temple' for quite so long. Also, the security was pretty lousy at the police station if John (a wanted fugitive) could so easily break in. *Sighs*<br />Personally, I was much more interested in how the precogs would adapt to the events AFTER the story, than in viewing the fourth quarter of this film. Overall, while I enjoyed Minority, it had almost zero re-watch value. I give it 3.5 stars. I've seen more involved plots on the Twilight Zone.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The cd as a whole is much more mellow and seems more finished than their first album. The first time I listened to it I really didn't like it, but every time I hear it I like it more and more. Definately recommended.<br />The Package (9.5/10): Starts out slow, gets heavy. Amazing vocals. (Because this song is over 7 minutes long, this is the song that may make you think &quot;Gee, Tool has songs this long&quot; but this album sounds NOTHING like Tool, other than that Maynard is the vocalist.)<BR>Weak And Powerless (10/10): The radio hit, an all around kickass song.      <BR>The Noose (11/10): My favorite! Vocals, bass, guitar, drums, it all comes together in this song. Definately one of the greatest songs on the album.<BR>Blue (9/10): Great sound, but not as addicting as some of the other songs.<BR>Vanishing (8/10): Sweet intro, but a pretty repeditive song, it gets old after a while.<BR>A Stranger (9.5/10): Once again, great vocals by Maynard. This guy has one of the best voices ever. <BR>The Outsider (10/10): One of the harder songs on the album, which really really rules. I love this song, it gets better each time I listen to it.<BR>Crimes (7/10): Just an instrumental piece, nothing special.<BR>The Nurse Who Loved Me (5/10): What the...? Sounds like something of a 1940's movie. Really odd, and the lyrics are even more bizarre.<BR>Pet (9/10): Another pretty hard song, cool vocals, and great guitar/bass/drums.<BR>Lullaby (7/10): Just another little instrumental song.<BR>Gravity (9/10): Decent song, but not the best on the album. A great song to close the album though. Nice vocals and bass.
B00008H2LB|5.0|At first, I didn't see what was so great about this album, Linkin Park's new and follow-up album to their awesome and magnificent Hybrid Theory LP. After listening to the album two times back-to-back and THEN a third time, with that third time of listening to it I then understood what is so great about this album. As I found out, it is very different from Hybrid Theory, but in an awesome way (and better way); this album is virtually an ONSLAUGHT onto the listener and attacks the one who is listening to this album (by the ears, I mean, not the lyrics, although the lyrics to this album are superb and well-thought out, I might add). I believe that's what they intended to do when they made this album. When you listen to this album, it's as if the members of Linkin Park are saying, &quot;If you want to listen to this album, f@#% you.&quot;. The songs are ALL superb; there is not one bad song on this album. If you liked Hybrid Theory, I HIGHLY recommend buying this album, but it may take a few listens until you get the feel for this album. (Don't worry, it's only 36 minutes in length. To be exact, 36:41) But when you do, you will cherish this album forever because of its advantages that it has over Hybrid Theory, which are what I discussed in this review of Meteora.
B00005JL78|4.0|I didn't think this was great, but it was an intriguing concept and was pretty well pulled off.  The plot twists at the end were pretty suprising.  All in all, a good use of a couple hours.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD is a perfect follow up CD to Mer de Noms. I don't even know where to start.  If you liked the last CD, you'll absolutely love this one.  <br />Perfect.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album goes way beyond &quot;Mer De Noms,&quot; which (somewhat justifiably) was touted by Rolling Stone as &quot;forest gnome rock.&quot;  <br />&quot;Thirteenth Step,&quot; on second and third listen seems way more personal and disciplined.  I think we can thank Executive Producer/Singer/Demigod Maynard James Keenan for that.  One star off for an all-around lack of hardcore and experimental sounds, which I was really hoping for in this iteration of APC.  This time around RS claimed it sounded akin to The Cure's &quot;Disintegration&quot; album, and once again, they're on the mark, though the comment was expressed as a compliment.  It shouldn't be.
B00003CXA2|5.0|In 1994, FORREST GUMP raised a ruckuss for winning 6 Academy Awards, including &quot;Best Picture&quot; - and it deserved each and every one of those awards.  Adapted from Winston Groom's novel, the film tells the tale of mentally retarded Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), who is present at many historic events while chasing after his lifelong love, Jenny (Robin Wright).  The special effects are so absolutely flawless it's as if Gump truly was at those events; it's amazing!  The soundtrack is also awesome, and adds to the atmosphere of the events at which Gump is present.  Hanks is at his best, and gives a truly moving performance; Wright is very good; and Sinise is really excellent.  This is one of the few films where even adults will cry.  The end scene, with Gump and Lt. Dan meeting before Gump's meeting, is a real moving moment.  There is also some lighthearted comedy at moments when you need it most; it's really a terrific film.  Of course, there's also excellent directing by Zemeckis; he has really given us an extraodinarily lifelike film.  You just can't afford to miss out on FORREST GUMP.
630512762X|4.0|Under the category of movies with singularly absurd premises, there are two sub-categories: those that are unwatchable precisely because of their absurd premise, and those that are thoroughly enjoyable precisely because of their absurd premise.<br />Face/Off falls in the latter sub-category. The singularly absurd premise: FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has his face removed by high-technology laser surgery, kept in a preservative bath, and replaced with that of comatose killer Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). His mission: to pose as Troy in a high-security prison for the most dangerous criminals alive, and get vital information on the whereabouts of a time bomb somewhere in LA from Troy's brother Pollux. The mission is so top-secret that even the prison officials don't know. Nor do Archer's wife and daughter.<br />Now, here's where the absurdity mounts, and with it the fun: Castor, confined in the secret facility where the surgery was performed, suddenly wakes from his coma. He feels no face, sees Archer's face in the glass liquid container, puts two and two together, and phones his henchmen, who kidnap the facility's staff and the few others who know about the operation, have them attach Archer's face where Castor's once was, and then kill them. Castor Troy becomes Sean Archer, Sean Archer becomes Castor Troy, at least in face. Troy visits Archer at the prison to tell him to expect to spend the rest of his life behind bars, so Archer must find a way to get out.<br />Whew. It's actually a lot less complicated to watch, which is exactly what makes it so much fun. Plus, the high-tech laser surgery scenes lend the whole face-swapping scenario a respectable degree of credibility.  Throw in John Woo's inimitable directorial style, wherein violence is treated poetically, and you have a movie that's flat-out fun to watch. <br />And let's not overlook the demands of the script on the two lead actors. Travolta had to play the good guy, and then the bad guy pretending to bethe good guy, but only when among the real good guys. Cage had to play the bad guy, and then the good guy pretending to be the bad guy, but only when among the real bad guys.<br />Get it? <br />You don't?<br />Then I strongly urge you to give this piece of barbaric lunacy a try. It's not the sort of film that earns Oscar nominations, but it's definitely a lot of fun, the kind we all have to treat ourselves to now and then.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John, while having some excellent albums, was and is primarily a singles artist.  These disks cover the glory days, where Elton and Bernie could basically write anything they wanted to and make it a hit, just fine.  But the real genius is that it redeems the Elton of the 80's.  Around this time the albums steadily declined in quality and the hits were few and far between.  However, the compilers of the album keep the wheat and cut chaff, showing how even in periods of personal decline, he was still able to put out songs that were on the same plane as his classic seventies work.  The double disk set is at a special price and is a great value if you want to get all you need to know about Elton John's work.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Casablanca represents the Hollywood studio system at the summit of its creative powers.  Michael Curtiz directs an excellent ensemble cast that is dramatic, hilarious and visually stunning (usually in the same scene).  The acting, the writing and the pacing is excellent and puts the vast majority of Hollywood's output (before and after) to shame.  <br />As far as the new DVD is concerned Warner Brothers really pulled out all the stops.  Its packed with extras that you will actually want to see and hear (unlike most DVD's).  It is well designed and visually appealing.  The only dud is the premiere episode of &quot;Who Holds Tomorrow?&quot;, which is a small screen adaptation of the film that rightfully faded into obscurity.  But, it is worthy, if for nothing else, as a historical footnote.<br />If you haven't seen this classic yet, trust me, you need to.  If you have an aversion to &quot;old movies&quot;, don't worry, the fast pacing, clever writing and double entendre's are perfect for more modern sensibilities.  What are you waiting for?  Run (or drive really fast) to the local video store and buy it now!
B00005JMFR|5.0|a fallow up review to my previous post Ronald L Desi you were asking for clues here are a few as to why i think the machines themselfs are slaves in there own matrix. Start with the matrix <BR>When Smith is intergating Morpheus. Smith tells him i must get free zion is the key now if he was a program made to hunt and kill any awaken human how would he be free. When Neo Gets shot by smith and dies his powers really come into play can we say mabye when neo killed smith his true self came into play mabye <BR>since the humans have the one mabye the machines do as well.<br />In matrix reloaded there are servial clues take it for instance<BR>all the rouge programs if the machines had total control wouldnt<BR>they be able to just erase them at will??And when Smith knocks <BR>on the door and asks for neo when they say they dont know him <BR>he hands his jack in plug to them and says tell him thank you <BR>for setting me free.Smith and his hell bent desire to <BR>destroy and take over as many as he can mabye he rather not exist<BR>and distroy it all rather then be a prisoner just my opion but hope this helps
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney delivers what was expected. All three of her cds sound similar but why stop with what works? I'm not complaining. I love Britney, her voice rocks. My favorite song of this cd would have to be &quot;Let me Be&quot;. I like the growling sound to her voice...this is defiently a girls cd. Looking forward to her next one which appers from her proformance at the NFL kickoff to be queit diffrent....yay!
B00006CXXU|1.0|OK....not to be \\"Hatein\\" but what in the world is she thinking. Everyone thinks she has enourmous talent...lol problay not her vocals they are concintrating on. Not my style, she sounds like shes a banshi on this cd. The songs are very annoying and her voice sounds the same on all the tracks. Very boring. The best song on the cd would have to be \\"Fighter\\". Seriously, this album sounds like kermit the frog got signed to a record deal. Little hint kiddies Just because someone can scream and take off their clothing with no shame does NOT mean they have talent it means they belong at a go-go bar or a very lame old rock concert.
078062369X|5.0|i'm a fan of the vampire movie genre and there are some out there that disappoint me a lot. Blade doesnt and I know that there are some guys out there who think this is a dumb movie, but you gotta love the Snipes man. (beep) you all, dont care what you say about this movie. Dorff is equally as good as Deacon Frost ( man can that guy put himself back together). a lot of blood, lot of violence and action, who cares really, it was a good time, not a waste of time, a good time. The opening rocks. but the only real flaw in this movie is that big blob guy. should've left him out. Those vampire chicks were hot hot hot, especally the blonde chick(Arly Jover). its addictive and what can I say.<br />Deacon Frost- &quot;You got the best of both worlds.&quot;
6302293553|5.0|by far the best comedy period on my list. I laughed my love handles off watching this movie. my friends were right and I thank them for letting me see it. it's really, really great with awesome charcters like The Knights who say \\"nee!\\", Tim the Enchanter, The Killer Bunny, The old man at the bridge of death.<br />favorite part in that whole movie is when they meet the killer bunny. There are some other hilarious and memoriable parts like the Castle Anthrax with all the horned up maidens who want spankings and oral sex and the holy hand grnade of antioch. If anyone doesnt like this movie they ought to be shot.<br />French man- \\" I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of eldeberries!\\"<br />a damn addictive movie. LOVE IT
B00005JKWI|3.0|I really liked this vampire movie, though its not as good as the first which was really excellent. A lot more blood with some messed up new nemesis'(the effects for how they suck the blood is great, must taste yummy). Snipes is always cool is this part and I think it fits him and I think its his best role, being the daywalker. The action hits cool with some new vampire slayings and there's one dopey scene in which Blade and that chick fight by the highlights, I mean come on you can tell that's fake, but the other effects are way cooler. I just hated that Danny John Jules (Cat from Red dwarf) had to die in the sewers as a lot of those Reapers came up and killed him. A good time.<br />...
B00008V2VM|3.0|this was a cool action flick. I wouldnt of watched it if Christian Bale wasnt in it. I watched him in this and it looked like he was gonna blow up with all that Matrix like fighting. Taye Diggs is &quot;aight also. I recomend this if you are atrue action fan and if you want to see MAtrixripoffmoves, which are 'aight also. a cool groove of a movie
B0000942LT|5.0|Staind has yet to let me down. This time they took a much softer approach to their music. Many people say it is too soft, but i think it is almost as good as Break the Cycle, but not quite. Here are some rankings for each of their songs.<br />1. Price to Play(5/5)- I heard this song on the radio and knew I had to pick up this CD<br />2. How About You(4/5)- This is a slower song that has a good beat and a good rythym so you can really get into this song<br />3.So Far Away(4/5)- This song was released and I was happy. It is a very good song.<br />4.Yesterday(4.5/5)- First song with cussing, but that makes it good.<br />5. Fray(4/5)- A all around good song<br />6. Sweet Zoe Jane(5/5)- First true slow song on the CD. It is a very good song that can be put on repeat and never get old<br />7. Fill Me UP(4/5)- a good song with good opening music.<br />8. Layne(3/5)- One of my least favorites on the CD<br />This is the best part of the CD. #9-14<br />9. Falling Down(5/5)- MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD...PERIOD<br />10. Reality(5/5)- This song is down right kick-@$$. The chourus is hard to imagine the lung capacity of Aaron Lewis. Try to sing it like he does.<br />11. Tonight(5/5)- Great song<br />12. Could It Be(5/5)- Great song about being youself. Sounds sappy but once you hear it you willchange your mind.<br />13. Blow Away(4/5)-Good song<br />14. Intro(5/5)- In this song Aaron thanks his family for putting up with him. He also critisizes people for underestimated his band. Does this title hint the next CD?
B0000BYM3K|4.0|It seems to me that Maiden used to know what type of band it was; not anymore.  This new album proves that they are either near the end, or they are about to unleash the best metal album the world has ever seen.  The first three tracks are absolutely pathetic.  Track 3 is called \\"No More Lies.\\"  Well, thank God for that!  The lyrics are a flat-out admission that they are close to done:  \\"Time is up, it couldn't last, but there's more things I'd like to do.  I'm coming back to try again, someday maybe I'll wait 'till then.\\"  Really sad.  Then, all of a sudden, comes a Maiden top ten -- at least -- \\"Montsegur.\\"  Right off the bat I noticed the subject matter:  Christian hypocrisy in the Middle Ages.  Power, anger and some of the best harmonies Bruce has ever laid down.  \\"Dance of Death\\" is next; a really slow, haunting tune that turns into a power anthem.  Then two more songs about lost potential and fear of living, basically -- like there is some sort of creeping doubt as to whether or not Maiden can continue.  Then!!  In my opinion, the best song Maiden has ever created:  \\"Paschendale\\".  The subject matter is war, and no one can sing about war better than Maiden.  Every band that has copied Maiden in the last 10 years (Rhapsody, Falconer, Blind Guardian, Dream Theater, etc. ad nauseum) is put to total shame.  Bruce's voice has never sounded better.  The album, finally, ends with a whimper.  I don't know if the whole dichotomy between fluffy, happy, commercial tunes and total dominating power, majesty and excellence was intended, or just an outcropping of a band that was hedging its bets because it didn't know where to go.  I give this four stars, because no Maiden fan could live without this album, but I give the stars reluctantly.  I think Maiden needs to leave current events behind (meaning their personal lives) and embrace their Medieval heritage if they want to regain their throne.
B00004TLN3|1.0|Just an awful movie~ Save your money and buy Sense and Sensibility, or Posession.  This was truly one of the worse films I've ever purchased and I'm even madder that I paid for this one~ It really is just \\"AWFUL\\"~
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I wont drone on about this record for too long but before I do I would like to correct a reviewer who claims this album took seven years since Mer De Noms to make. Its been seven years since aenima perhaps and this is not the same band. So strike that off your downfalls list. Anyhow, and with that being said, this is a really really good cd. I cant say whether I like it better than Mer De Noms but I think in time I will. The first cd has a much lighter touch where this one is heavier and in alot of ways more emotional. I cant think of any of their songs, sans the hollow, that come close to blue, or the outsider which incidentally, for me, is one of my favorite Maynard vocals ever. I think they have followed up well and it would be a shame if youare a fan of this band and didnt get this album. Even if you arent buy it anyway, you will love it!
B0000AZKPC|5.0|If you can't say it, sing it, they say.  And Sonata Arctica sings it like no one else.  For someone who hasn't heard them but knows they're a power metal band, recollections of Rhapsody or Blind Guardian - fantasy oriented bands - may present themselves; but what sets this amazing group of musicians apart from the pack is their new, original, creative approach to a style of music that is beginning to show its age.  Evil dragons plundering villages, armor-clad knights riding valiantly into glorious battle?  Look elsewhere for that; Sonata Arctica's lyrics are rooted very much in reality - and in unusual examples of reality.  <br />The subjects of their songs - spending too much time on the internet, the effects of war on a person - are often unorthodox and may take the first-time listener by surprise.  But this is part of what distinguishes them from the masses.  Unlike most power metal bands, especially their German counterparts, S.A.'s music has a very &quot;cold&quot; feel to it (they are from Finland) which means you will not fully experience their music until you listen in the winter as the snow blankets the ground and your breath crystalizes in front of you.  <br />The musicianship is breathtaking.  While many criticize technical bands for being all showboat and no musical substance, S.A. has found that perfect of all places - the intersection where exceptional musicianship and technical ability meets true musical expression and taste.  Their songs are catchy yet complex.  The guitar lines are melodic when they need to be and shred when they need to be (and Jani can SHRED!).  The drummer has unmatched endurance on the double-kick.  The keyboards add the richest texture you'll ever hear in metal.  What more can you ask?  They deliver the total package.<br />And for those who pass them off as a second-rate Stratovarius, well, I can only feel sorry for you.  They may have taken their cue from Stratovarius, but they have built on that foundation and taken it to a completely different level.  Now that Century Media was released this in the United States, you have no excuse for missing out.  This is the most incredible music I have ever heard.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Sorry guys, this just doesn't live up to the name of Fleetwood Mac.  I really love FM and was totally pumped when they came out with The Dance and saw them on that tour.  It was magical.  When this CD came out, though, I was very disappointed.  I can't say that it's entirely due to the absence of Christine McVie, though it is definitely noticable that she isn't there. &quot;What's the World Coming To&quot; is a good opening song, but the album sputters after that in certain places.  Highlights for me are &quot;torn Down&quot; which reminds me of the guitar parts in &quot;Gypsy.&quot;  The title track and &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; are also good songs, but other than that I can't recommend this album.  The live version of &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; is better than this including a studio version seems pointless to me.  &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; is a decent ending song, but if they plan on recording any more albums like this, I hope it's their sign-off tune.<BR>One more note:  the amount they charged for tickets on this tour was simply outrageous.  I paid less for the reunion tour and saw what I'm sure was a much better show.  Has FM lost touch with what is most important...their fans?
B000002LOE|5.0|After its debut on the Warner label, R.E.M. changed gears and gave us &quot;Out of Time&quot;, an undisputed classic in the R.E.M. catalog. Beginning the acoustic instrument bent that continued into &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, the boys constructed an album of truth, beauty, and, surprisingly, love songs. Michael said earlier in their career that he hated love songs, but the band produces an album of unique love songs, nothing like what was on the radio at that time - obessive, unrequited love (&quot;Losing My Religion&quot;), in-crisis love (&quot;Me In Honey&quot;, said to be an answer to 10,000 Maniacs' &quot;Eat for Two&quot;), awkward, unsure love (&quot;Low&quot;), mother and child (&quot;Belong&quot;), and the end of love (&quot;Country Feedback&quot;). All these love songs, woven together with Michael's exceptionally beautiful vocals, Peter's newfound skill on both the guitar and the mandolin, and additional musical mastery by both Bill and Mike, present a solid musical tapestry. Add to the mix guest vocals by Kate Pierson and KRS-One and you have one unforgettable album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|There are no other bands out there the can compare to Tool or APC's arrangements, writing, and overall musical talents. This album is no exception. As other reviewers have said it is slightly more mellow then the first APC release, but even more accomplished in my mind. As with the Tool albums and the first APC album,  they continue to produce very unique musical patterns that consistently suck you in. If you truly appreciate accomplished musicians and thought provoking writing regardless of genre then you will like this album. Every song is great, but I would agree with others that \\"The Noose\\", the third track, is about as \\"Perfect\\" as a piece of music can get. Brilliant....
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I bought this album about three months ago...listen to it....let it grow on me...and sometimes cried when I heard it. The day Johnny died, I felt like I'd lost part of my childhood. I grew up with my mom and dad playing him in our house, and Johnny is part of the soundtrack of my formative years. I'd grown up hearing his standards like &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;I Walk The Line&quot;, and &quot;Daddy Sang Bass&quot;. Years later, relearning how to play guitar, I relearned to play by practising &quot;Daddy Sang Bass&quot; and &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;.<br />I am glad that he left behind such an album like this...for me a single adjective or superlative cannot describe it. When I first heard &quot;Hurt&quot;, I was speechless...Trent Reznor's song never sounded so beautiful, now in Johnny's hands. The other songs on the album also stand as testimonies to what Cash can do to an already good song - the gems that stand out on this album are &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, and &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.<br />But certainly don't forget Cash's own compositions - the outstanding one on this album was &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;. Lyrically amazing, unique delivery, and nice technical additions (namely his reading of part of Revelation sounding like you're hearing it on an old 45).<br />Cash may have his shortcomings, but you can't deny that the man is a legend and probably one of the greatest musicians ever. Johnny, may you rest in peace - you've &quot;joined the family circle at the throne.&quot; You will never be forgotten.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I disagree with the negative reviews below. All they want to see at the Oscars are movies that have crime, wars, and drama in them. Don't get me wrong, I also like to see these kinds of movies, but we need to look at films from a different angle. It is very unfair to see just dramatic movies win Oscars. If the  musical/comedy has humor, intelligence, and a good story to it, why not award it? It is sometimes good to change. Finally, I thought every musical number in this film was done without a glitch. The choreography was immpecable. Each actor sang their song the way it was meant to be sung. As for the acting, everyone gave a phenomenal performance, especially Cathrine Zeta-Jones. I thank you Rob Marshall for bringing back the musical genre. There must be more musicals in the works for the near future. I strongly recommend this movie. IT DESERVED EVERY OSCAR IT WON!
B000002MG1|5.0|This album by far is the most cohesive, beautifully dark, and musically stunning of R.E.M.'s catalog. Outside of coming from one of the most talented and influential bands of the last century, the album itself speaks volumes. The return to acoustic instrumentation which began with Out of Time is not only continued, but augmented with Peter's skillfull electric guitar playing (namely on Drive, Everybody Hurts, Man on the Moon, and Ignoreland). In addition, this album is lyrically sound - by now, it's evident that Michael has permamently given up the &quot;mumbling&quot; which graced R.E.M.'s earlier albums. He gives the poetic and meaningful lyrics (such as Try Not to Breathe and Nightswimming) the full benefit of his now clear, confident, and distinctive singing voice. In addition, this is some of Bill's best drum playing and Mike's vocals and playing are at top notch as well. This album is a MASTERPIECE - if you're not familiar with R.E.M. this would be the best album to hear first.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This is one of the best recordings of 2003. Her creativity is absolutely outstanding. Her music and her singing are truly inspiring. The Worldwide Underground RULES! Get it now.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love all the songs on here. From My Immortle to My last breath they songs are mad awesome. I would recommend this CD to anyone
B0000640SA|5.0|If ever there was a movie that Guy Pearce was destined to play in, Memento is it.  Don't get me wrong, L.A. Confidential was superb, but this is just amazing.  Guy plays Leonard, a man who remembers nothing other than the fact that his wife was brutally raped and murdered.  He is unable to make any new memories, so that leaves him unable to pinpoint exactly who is responsible for this terrible deed that he cannot erase from his mind.  Through a series of tattoos and Polaroid snapshots, he tries to piece together some logic to the events that happen to him throughout the course many days, weeks, months or even years for that matter.  Leonard has no idea.  Shot in black and white and color and told in a reverse-forward manner that will amaze you, Memento has everything going for it.  The limited edition DVD is very confusing, and if you purchase it, be warned.  It's puzzling, but it certainly fits the movie.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This cd is great although they could have done much better. When I first got this cd I would listen to it everyday and I thought it was the best cd I owned. Gradually though I realized that this was definitely not the best cd I owned. It's a great cd don't get me wrong, but it's hard to listen to this cd all the way through without taking a break. The cd gets boring as it goes along. The true saviors on this cd are songs like &quot;shadow on the sun&quot;, &quot;set it off&quot;, &quot;cochise&quot;, and &quot;light my way&quot;. These, in my opinion, are the best songs on the cd. The worst songs are &quot;last remaining light&quot; and &quot;i am the highway&quot;. these two songs will put you to sleep. It isn't the fact that they're a bit softer than the rest of the album its that they sound like the band was like &quot;hey, lets write some slow songs for the hell of it.&quot; There are other slower songs on the this album that are good. For example, &quot;getaway car&quot; and &quot;like a stone&quot; are two very good songs. I definitely advise giving this a listen. Oh yea, about the whole rage/soundgarden fusion. I am big fan of both rage against the machine and soundgarden. However, audioslave is not quite as good as either of them. I hope they do a little better for their next album. But definitely, if you do like rage or soundgarden, buy this album. It's good.
B000068TPN|4.0|This film is honest and unflinching in it's portrayal of war.  Set in the country of Vietnam during the first U.S. led battle, Gibson stars as Lt. Col. Hal Moore.  Based on the novel &quot;We Were Soliders Once, And Young&quot; written by Hal Moore, this is in my opinion a great adaptation that was slammed by critics, but I assure any fan of war movies...you will put this right up there with the greatest war films of all time.  The DVD has a lot going for it and is highly suggested for any fan of war films.
0385483821|5.0|Very few people in history have the true gift of foresight; Andy Grove is certaintly one of those people.  It also shows people like Nick Carr can be idiots. He proclaimed that &quot;I.T. is dead&quot;.  Nick Carr thinks he is smart because he is able to see a few years into the future and pat himself on the back for it at the same time.  Andy Grove's vision is not linear and thus allows him to anticipate changes in business paradigms and to distinguish between tech fads and tech innovations.  Ironically, the chapter that made the most sense to me was regarding inflection points in your career.    <br />This book is a must read even if you don't have any inclination for business.  Andy Grove has sound and practical advice for anyone to follow.
B00008US8R|5.0|this c.d is awesome!  amy lee has probably the BEST female vocal singing voice out of any female singer...i think she's even better than christina aquilara! (who i never did, never will like)  <BR>this c.d has a nice change to it.  cuz lately all there's been is punk, pop, and rap.  this has some really well put together songs.  and evanescence is NOT another linkin park with a chick in it!! have u listened to the gothic/betrayed/depressing/realistic lyrics to these songs?!  sure there are some simalarities, but i truely think Evanescence is much much much much better song writers than linkin park.  <br />well what r u waiting for? just get this cd already! i promise you, you won't regret it!
B00005221M|5.0|There have been four film versions of James Fenimore Cooper's novel. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the one released in 1936 (starring Randolph Scott, Binnie Barnes, Heather Angel, Henry Wilcoxon, and Bruce Cabot), I enjoyed this version even more. (It is probably unfair to compare and contrast films based on essentially the same material which were produced 56 years apart.) Brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and with a narrative driven by the compelling performance of Daniel Day-Lewis (as Hawkeye), this film examines a series of incidents in 1757 during the French and Indian War in which British forces were opposed by both the French and their Huron allies. Hawkeye was adopted and raised by the Mohicans. When the film begins, only Chingachgook (properly pronounced \\"Chicago\\" according to Mark Twain) and his son Uncas are the only Mohicans who remain. They accompany Hawkeye as he attempts to escort the Munro sisters to Fort William Henry where their father commands the British troops, under rigorous attack by the French troops under General Montcalm's command. Later, for reasons which should not be revealed in this brief commentary, Hawkeye and his two Mohican companions again struggle to guide the Munro sisters to safety, by which time a strong mutual attraction has developed between Hawkeye and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) as well as between Uncas (Eric Schweig) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May). They are pursued by Magua (Wes Studi) and his Huron warriors and then....<br />Others have their own reasons for admiring this film so much. Here are mine. First, as in Dances with Wolves, Studi portrays a warrior adversary (in this instance a Huron) with exceptional skill. He is the principal cause of the prevailing sense of menace which continues throughout the film. Also, the music score and cinematography complement the narrative development under Michael Mann's crisp and sensitive direction. Also, Day-Lewis provides another masterful performance (as always) as Hawkeye who is fully prepared to cope with almost any crisis. It is impossible not to concentrate on Day-Lewis whenever he is on screen, as is also the case in his most recent film, Gangs of New York. Finally, the cast and crew enable me to become so emotionally involved in the series of incidents that I feel as if I were also trudging through the woods, approaching the beseiged fort at night, then mingling among those within it, and later fleeing from the Hurons until the film's especially powerful climax. How unusual that a film which combines so many qualities of an epic also establishes and then sustains a sense of intimacy with the central characters.<br />I appreciate the improved image and sound of the DVD version and only wish supplementary material (such as provided, for example, with Dances with Wolves) had been included. Presumably Mann and Day-Lewis have much of value to say about preparing for and then making this great film.is fully prepared to cope with almost any crisis.

B0000AXE8I|2.0|I liked the first Matrix.  I thought it was a different offering in a see of bad movies.  It had a fairly interesting plot and okay acting (except for Keanu).  They should have kept it at one Matrix and not make anymore.  But cash cows being what they are this movie was made.<BR>Anyways, the action scenes in this movie were okay for the most part but can we come up with something other than the slow motion animation that is now so prevelant?  It was relatively fresh in the first one, now it is getting stale.  Another thing, why the scene with the infinite Agent Smiths?  I thought it was cool at first but dragged on too long.  And then the dialogue, gah.  I don't like Star Trek because of all the meaningless Technobabble and this stuff made Star Trek look exciting.  About the only scene I really liked was the restaurant.<BR>However the thing that bugged me most was the abrupt \\"ending\\".  I realize this was because they were releasing Revolutions in November (or so they same).  It seems more like like they can make double the revenue if they release it as two movies instead of one.  So now that they've got this precedent, more movies will be released like this.  But then again, this was a 90 minute movie that seemed like 900 minutes, so I don't think I could take the full 3 hours worth of movie.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|What else can be said? The title for this review says it all. Without Animal House, there wouldn't be nearly as many stupid college frat movies as there are today. Buy this on sight!
B00005JKZV|4.0|I would have given this movie 5 stars if it weren't for the impending release of the extended version in November.  I was going to wait for that one, I really was but impulse got the better of me so I bought this version.<BR>Anyways, I thought the movie was really good and has many things that movies out of Hollywood are lacking these days:  a compelling story, believable characters, good vs. evil and a good soundtrack.  The battle scenes in this movie were fantastic.  I thought the pace was pretty good, it seemed like an hour and half movie instead of the three it was pushing.  And I can't wait for the next one to come out.<BR>This movie shows the potential of Hollywood to put out a quality product (hear that Mr. Lucas?)
B000068IEU|3.0|As far as directorial debuts are concerned,Wes Craven's Last House on the Left is a great achievement.The film was his first to be credited as a the sole director after sharing this responsibility earlier in '71 with Sean S. Cunnigham for the family movie Together.<BR>I waited so long to watch the film, since it was banned for ages in the UK because the British Board of Film Classification-BBFC-had their knives out and were admant not to let this film 'corrupt the morality of society'. Not before the departure of its famous chairman James Ferman, that British audiences got finally the chance to rewatch previously banned films thanks to the long awaited BBFC's  new more liberal policies.So I really wanted to watch Last House on The Left to see what the fuss was all about, and whether the controvery was well justified,( being personally against most censorship in Cinema).<BR>Well my first impression was that the film is indeed disturbing.Very. It is a heavy and violent journey into the twisted and sadistic minds of four escaped convicts, torturing and killing two innocent women. The violence and sadism in the film is unrelenting, and very raw, at times psychologically claustrophobic, at others gory and shocking.<BR>I never thought I would say this one day, but in some way I could see where the BBFC were coming from. I believe their most area of concern was that this unexplained and extreme sadism, which is both suggestive and graphic was is some way gratitious. Although the message of the film as Craven explains himself in the DVD extras, is anti violence, none of the characters, even the dim witted 'Junior Stillo' show any remorse for their act. The sex crimes which the four psychos brag about,is in reality a very serious crime, and the sexual sadism and pleasure they get from it is very disturbing without any moral or redemptive outlet, the forced peeing in the trousers, the forced lesbianism, the rape, are all images that test the boundaries of human evil and suffering, and will make the viewer squirm in disgust: Craven too admitted in his introduction to the film that Last House on the Left is an ugly movie.<BR>My first question was: Why?? <BR>Do we need to actually SEE these boundaries? Would the real intended message of the film be served by these images?<BR>Probably not.<BR>There is even some humour in the film, which I found somehow misplaced and in bad taste because it somehow deflects attention from the suffering of the victims,instead of giving the viewer some relief as intended. <BR>The quality of the film is similar to many small independant features of the period, and not unlike Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  (Personally I very much prefer Tobe Hooper's film, because of its clever suggestive style).Craven was to build a career for himself as a renowned horror movie director, however the career of most of the actors in the film did not fare as good. The two women victims, Sandra Cassell and Lucy Grantham stopped making films soon after, Fred J Lincoln became a 'porn' director, while Jeramie Rain, the psycho woman of the gang, became Mrs Richard Dreyfuss!!(the one and only Mr D.)<BR>So Last House on the Left is not to everybody's taste, and it guarrantees to leave you with a feeling of unease, disgust and horror.You might hate it, or love it but you sure can not ignore it, and this is the power of movie making,to make you think about the film long after you watch it regardless of your opinion of it, and for this alone it is a great achievement from Craven.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This cd was beautifully written. My favorite songs on this cd so far are The Package and Weak and Powerless. I love Maynard's voice on The Package. It is a beautiful beginning for a great album. I loved Mer de Noms also, and I can't decide which cd I like better. If you like Tool or A Perfect Circle, then be sure to get this cd. You won't be disappointed.
0151008116|5.0|Life Of Pi was a great read that you learn from, it's not just another book. What I enjoyed the most was that it doesn't have the dreamy human animal relationship, there was no hugging between Pi and the tiger. it's a survival story. After I read the book I was telling someone about it and I told the person that it was a true story (forgetting that it was a novel), that's how good it is. maybe it is a true story!
1573301051|5.0|From the start I really wanted to see whos who(Mariah or Celine)<BR>well, watch the divas as they perform &quot;A Natural Woman&quot; youll see that Mariah gets the high notes so natural, while Celine shouts just to reach the notes! And Mariah sings her part very different of all the divas. It's the &quot;Princess of Soul&quot; singing with her &quot;Queen&quot; a powerful combination!!!!!!
1400034779|5.0|THE LADIES' NO. 1 DETECTIVE AGENCY is the first novel by Alexander McCall Smith, a medical law professor at Edinburgh University. A wonderful book with smart characterizations and enough mystery to keep you going; the scenery is breathtaking, if somewhat severe: we are at the edge of the Kalahari. There are many interesting details about life in Africa, specifically Botswana, and many intriguing insights into mores and manners. I really enjoyed this book! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I've been listening to this thing ever since I got it (I am listening to it as I type this), and I still don't think *anything* on the album compares to &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;... except for &quot;The Noose.&quot;<br />&quot;The Noose&quot; is easily the best track on the CD... it evokes images of &quot;Orestes&quot; from &quot;Mer De Noms,&quot; and is a simply hauntingly beautiful piece of music. Pure brilliance on the part of Maynard &amp; Co.<br />While &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; may be the most &quot;original&quot; (that is to say bizarre) song on the album, it is not the best -- that distinction goes to &quot;The Noose.&quot; (FYI, I thought &quot;Orestes&quot; was the best track on &quot;Mer De Noms,&quot; followed closely by &quot;3 Libras&quot;)<br />The rest of the CD is forgettable. Nothing work mentioning. &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; is kind of the same in that regard, but it at least had a better balance (6 of 12 as opposed to 2 out of 12) Not worth $15, but worth $10 if you're a Maynard fan &amp; you buy it @ Circuit City (It's $9.99 there right now).
B000068PQ0|5.0|Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is an incredible rock-opera that brings the Lips back to the top. How could any experimental fan overlook this masterpiece? I'll be first to admit that I didn't like it at first, but after a about a week, I couldn't stop listening to it. In fact, this album is the entire reason I got into experimental. I reccomend it to anyone that is open-minded to new music.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Its so difficult to find new good music these days.  It seems like everyone wants to sell out and go pop.  This is music for someone with a more complex taste in music.  I find it hard to find that anyone would not enjoy this album.  Its one of those albums you can just listen to over and over again and never get sick of.  Of course I have to say that Maynard has the heavenly voice of an angel.  Nothing can really compare to his singing but it is truly beautiful.  Thirteen Steps is quite a bit more mellow than Mer De Noms.  If I had to compare this album to anything I would say it is a cross between late Tool and Enya.  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because I believe 5 stars should be reserved for masterpieces such as Ten, In Utero, and Aenima.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I think the 5-star rating is thrown around waaaaay to often. When I see bands like Trapt and the Black-Eyed Peas getting five stars, I cringe. However, The Thirteenth Step is fully worthy of all five (and possibly more) stars. This album is much different than APC's debut, Mer de Noms. That was a great album, but it may well have been called the Maynard and Billy show. They stole the show with their God-given skill at singing and songwriting respectively. In The Thirteenth Step, though, APC operates as a whole. No instrument consistently stands out above the rest, no single person gets all the glory. This album explores the groups darker side, mixing powerful guitar riffs with haunting, frantic vocals. The mix is purposfully abrasive at times, grating against your musical skin in order to move you emotionally in ways you have never experienced before. Tracks like &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot;, &quot;The Noose&quot;, and &quot;The Outsider&quot; are all standout tracks, but more important is that the album as a whole is seamless. I give The Thirteenth Step, what will become known as one of the greatest albums of this decade, my highest reccomendation.
0060278250|5.0|I have read 100's of fantasy/sci fi books and can only wish that this series, which includes Sabriel and Lirael, would have been available during my adolescence (we had the Narnia series, but not much else).<br />Even as an adult, it is very easy to identify with Lirael, her fears of not fitting in, her fears of being incompetent, her suicidal thoughts -- all of these themes are covered in an absolutely thrilling adventure of a young girl finding her destiny with a \\"companion\\" (no spoilers here) continuing from the story which began with the second book Lirael. This tale concludes the themes from the first two books of classic good versus evil with a lot of scorcery and a little bit of swords, including much overland travel and a stunning conclusion.<br />What makes these stories so brilliant are the interesting quirks of magically-endowed people who are marked by a sort of brand called a \\"charter mark\\" on their foreheads and who live in their own world adjacent to a non-magical world (much like ours, in fact). Only a magical \\"wall\\" separates the two worlds, and some overlap occurs. My only criticsim is that the reason for separation of the two worlds is never made quite clear, but anyway it conveniently paves the way for some interesting juxtapositions and plot twists.<br />Not for die-hard Harry Potter fans, whose story so far really only flirts with dark themes, this story takes you all the way to the 9th Gate of Death and back! For mature adolescents, and adults, you will get a lot out of this book - I read Lirael and Abhorsen, each in 1 day's time! In my opinion, this series leaves Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" series in the dust.
B00006LPER|5.0|What a brilliant movie about incest and how it leads to the devastation of a woman.  A woman who can't feel anything, who is trying desperately in every way to feel...something.  And when someone presents himself to draw her out of her withered self, all she can do is re-enact her adoloscent despair.  Come on, folks -- her mother tells her she's filthy, she berates her for giving in to a man -- this is Psychology 101, but brilliantly acted and compelling.  Of course, she wants her student to be damaged, because she is both jealous and trying to protect her student from her overbearing parents.  I doubt that I'm going to sleep well tonight.
B000060MY6|4.0|a lovely and surreal film that explores the areas in between and various incarnations of the void. The deliberate and methodical style of taking the viewer into unknown, but strangely familiar surroundings proves eerie and soothing. One truly loses the self and becomes enveloped by this intense vision.<br />For those who value escapism in all its glories and find visual images so sumptuous you can almost taste them...
B00007BH5C|5.0|The Lord of the Rings:  Fellowship of the Ring CD is absolutely a beautiful CD! I recommend this CD to anyone who loved the movie.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I listen to this soundtrack more than I do for the Fellowship's. The music is thrilling and touching. I never really was into all the classical music. If I got a score from a movie, I would only listen to a few songs, for example: Star Wars: Main Theme, Imperial March, etc..the ones that everyone knows. It wasn't until I got this soundtrack that I would listen to every one and enjoy it. Thanks to this soundtrack, I buy more soundtracks with just instrumental/classical and I listen/enjoy it more. <br />Some of my favorites are: The Foundations of Stone, The Riders of Rohan, The King of the Golden Hall, Helm's Deep, The Hornbug, Samwise the Brave, and of course Gollum's Song. Emiliana Torrini, does have a somewhat annoying voice, but it goes perfectly with the song and the words.<br />I definitely recommend this! AWESOME work Howard Shore!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|A Wonderful album with a mix of great sounds. &quot;No more lies&quot; has shades of their previous works. The title track &quot;Dance of death&quot; begins with great symphony added with Bruce's fantastic mesmerizing vocals. &quot;Journeyman&quot; is another unforgettable number. Rest of the tracks are none the less. Iron Maiden just seems getting better with each album. Dance of Death is fantastic!!!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I love this CD! The music accompanied with the lyrics and her vocals are incredible. Yes, it is different from Mama's Gun, but that is the brillance behind it! Erykah truly lets into another chapter of her world. The guests on the album compliment her style very well (Lenny Kravitz, Caron Wheeler, Zap Mama, Roy Hargrove, Angie Stone, Queen Latifah and Bahamadia). I only wish it could be a little longer. But it a great EP.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album puzzles me from start to finish.  The opening track &quot;The Package&quot; is a good one but doesn't seem to be right track for the opener to the album.  Perhaps the 10th track &quot;Pet&quot; which is the most powerful track on the album belongs in it's place.  <BR>  <BR>   &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; seems completely out of place on this album and is simply annoying, and while the closer &quot;Gravity&quot; is great song, it belongs more towards the middle of the album.  <BR>    <BR>   &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is an album that is a bit unaccessible and as a result requires two or three spins, and while it at times is heavier than its predecessor &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; fillers like &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;, and &quot;The Noose&quot; bring it down a bit.  Nonetheless, this album is still worth purchasing if you like a perfect circle... ORESTES<BR>  <BR>Standouts on the album are:<br />&quot;Pet&quot;<BR>&quot;Weak &amp; Powerless&quot;<BR>&quot;The Outsider&quot;<BR>&quot;The Package&quot;<BR>&quot;Gravity&quot;
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I'd put \\"Dance of Death\\" about on par with the last CD, which was very good, and arguably their best since \\"Somewhere In Time\\".<br />There was a time when Iron Maiden lost Adrian Smith and replaced him with Gers and they really become highly mediocre.  When Dickinson left for a few albums, they were even worse.  Smith came back for the last CD as did Dickinson, and they kept Gers as a third guitarist.  The result is they have all the original people and an extra guitarist to use as they please.<br />They haven't changed their formula at all really.  There is a lot of familiarity in these songs, and some of the lyrical topicality is silly, but these guys still know how to write songs and jam better than the incredibly overrated Metallica.  And though Metallica seemed to have forever turned me off from the use of a string orchestra with heavy metal, Maiden does it on this album very tastefully.  Perhaps it seems to fit better with Maiden since their music is inherently more complex than Metallica's and more classical in design.  It helps that there is nothing overly dramatic about the insertion of the strings in the songs too.  It's used more as a legitimate musical addition rather than as a \\"Hey, listen to the strings here and how cool they sound and aren't we sophisticated?\\"<br />I'm liking this CD more and more with each listen.  I may even like it better than the last one before long.  Bruce Dickinson definitely sounds better than he has in many years.  The complaints about all the songs sounding familiar and there being too much repetition of the choruses are somewhat valid.  However, Maiden tends to always sound a bit familiar because of that chug-a-lug sound and because it's hard to not drastically change your formula for 20 years and sound new.  Therefore, this is not a valid complaint to me.  The choruses are getting a bit repetitive. \\"No More Lies\\" is a perfect example of this.  Great song but for the endless screaming of \\"No more lies!\\" about 100 times.  Maiden has always followed a kind of pop formula when it comes to making choruses catchy, but seemingly not to this extent.<br />Wildest Dreams - 7/10 - Cool riff, but another song where the chorus is a bit tiring.  Otherwise, the song is very rocking and upbeat.<br />Rainmaker - 8/10 - Nice little lead-in that reminds me of older Iron Maiden.  Like Wildest Dreams, it has very cool song construction and progressions.  Cool solos too, which is common on this CD.<br />No More Lies - 7/10 - Another solid song and the first epic on this CD.  But there is entirely too much of Bruce caterwauling on this song.  Don't get me wrong because he sounds great on this song.  I just get the feeling that he's tired of lies for seem reason.<br />Montsegur - 9/10 - Reminds me of Losfer Words from Powerslave.  Very much a throwback to old Maiden with cool historical lyrics about battles and Satan and all that wonderment.<br />Dance of Death - 9/10 - A cool song that is the first on this CD to use strings.  The main riff that kicks in once the song picks up sounds like Maiden mixed with an Irish drinking song.  Very cool.<br />Gates of Tomorrow - 7/10 - Interesting opening riff, but it sounds more like something from one of the 80s hair bands than Maiden.  This song reminds me a bit of the songs you don't remember so much from Piece of Mind and Number of the Beast...songs like \\"Total Eclipse\\" and \\"Quest for Fire\\"...Good song, but it doesn't stand out.<br />New Frontier - 8/10 - Nicko's first songwriting contribution.  Much more of a straightforward rocker in the mold of something from \\"Killers\\", with a bit of \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" thrown in.<br />Paschendale - 8/10 - Once again some excellent battlefield lyrics.  There are some strings on this song too, but they are very understated.  This song probably would have been better off about 3 minutes shorter though, and I actually like the Maiden epics.<br />Face In The Sand - 8/10 - A similar beginning to \\"Dance of Death\\", which in turn had a similar beginning to a number of other Maiden songs.  Quiet build to something a little more rocking.  Again there are some strings on here, and they are probably the most overused on this track.  However, once Nicko starts smashing the double bass, this song takes on a whole new feel.<br />Age of Innocence - 8/10 - Yet another mellow beginning that transforms into an all-out rocking riff.  It then goes into Maiden's catchiest chorus in years...perhaps it's a bit too catchy for Maiden purists.  However, I think think the way that it buttresses itself with that rocking riff and the way Bruce sounds a dark note with his \\"like an old dream\\" line makes it a destined to be a live staple in future years.<br />Journeyman - 8/10 - An acoustic song that reminds me a lot of \\"Prodigal Son\\" instead of instantly making me think that Maiden has gone soft with some kind of unplugged crapola.  They do have strings here, but again they very much suit the song.  It's really an excellent closer to the CD.  I'm only giving it a 8 because I'm not too fond of the chorus.  The rest of the song I enjoy quite a bit.

B00003CXSP|2.0|The movie starts off waaaayy to slow.  Hanibal just sits in one area while they are going crazy looking for him.  I expected something big to happen.  I wanted someone to get brutally murdered or something ya know?  But it never really reached a good enough climax for me to recommend this movie to anyone.
0316666343|5.0|I just can't say it any better than that - the book was wonderful! I love the perspective of heaven and looking down on the family watching things progress. I love the connection she made in the end and how her boyfriend knew it was her without even speaking...her final touch with the living world. Yes, I thought it was great. Two thumbs up to Alice for this amazing story!!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Not that bad of an album and a very solid effort overall by Maiden. <BR>Lots of amazing twin guitaring. Bruce as always sounds good. Production could have been better and there are a couple of not very good tracks in the album. But the thing that makes up for everything are the SOLOS......some of the best maiden soloing of all time.<BR>Good to see they're still playing good music. Up The Irons!!!!
B00008LDPU|4.0|I have The Animatrix here from netflix, so I sat down tonight and watched it. Wow. I was very impressed with it. It's nine short anime-style films (four written by the Wachowski brothers, if I'm not mistaken; the others conceptualizations from famous anime writers/directors) based in/around the world of the Matrix. It makes a very nice supplemental piece to the film; adds greater depth and provides a deeper understanding of some of it. (Plus, it's always fun to see Neo and Trinity again! lol bonus that they were voiced by Keanu and Carrie-Anne.) Great techno beats in a lot of the shorts, and some truly stunning visuals. Some of the concepts were raw, disturbing, edgy. A lot of really interesting types of machines in there too. I think that, hands down, my favorite one was &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot;. The animation is computer-generated, by the same team that did the Final Fantasy movie, and boy is it impressive. I really wasn't convinced at first that it WAS animated. :) The story is such that it could fit right in to one of the movies. I also really enjoyed The Second Rennaissance, Parts One and Two: these two were the backstory of why the machines rose up against man, how the surface was destroyed, how the machines took over and began using man, and how the world became what it is &quot;today&quot;. <br />Four out of five stars from me. (Five star movies are ones I'll watch over and over again, and though I am likely to revisit this movie with other Matrix fans, I would probably only watch the three mentioned in my review on a repeated basis.)<br />If you're a fan of the Matrix movies and/or anime, I'd highly recommend watching these.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The Beach Boy's Pet Sounds record changed my life forever. Every inch of that statement is true. The truth of it is, this record is not simple in anyway shape or form. It's actually very complicated because it is concieved and tailored to make it sound simple. Pet Sounds shouldn't be heard by people who are still living with their parents. I first heard this record about 3 months after moving out of my folks house for the first time. When I heard this album, it spoke to me in ways that were so damn soothing to hear, the words, the music, the attitude, softness, and complisity, it all seemed to have been made only for me! Yet I knew damn well it came out in the 60's, and that just made it all seem so wonderfully amazing! Even if you already have moved out before and are now back at your folks house, do not buy this album till you are out on your own again, then buy this record. Or at least buy it now, then wait till your out on your own, tear open the plastic after about a couple of weeks then listen to this album and it will make your brain shine just as if the Beach Boys polished it themselves with turtle wax!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have waited three years for this album and I am very happy to say that it was worth the wait. Defintly music for the soul.
B00005YU1O|3.0|The animation in this DVD is super, and alone worth the price. But the story, if there is one, or at least the theme, if there is one, gets lost in the confusion. Toward the end,  a plot line finally emerges, though it doesn't seem related to the beginning and middle portions of the movie. It is about whether the protagonist is dead or alive; he can't seem to wake up and isn't sure. It is too reminiscent of &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; to satisfy, and besides, at least in &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; there was a concrete outcome; the viewer was able to understand what happened. In &quot;Waking Life&quot; it still isn't clear.<br />It appears the writer(s) had some good ideas, but didn't provide near enough structure in the film to enable the viewer to see where they were going. Perhaps they weren't going anywhere, and while that works with some films, it doesn't with this one. This one is in desperate need of coherence and connections, and much of the philosophical material, which is presented in a boring manner reminiscent of an impersonal lecture hall, fails to guide or connect the scenes. If the writers wanted to present something on the issue of people living without really feeling alive and connected to the world, as the review on the back of the DVD implies, they failed to do it. They could have if they'd done something different with the ending, but once they confused the concept of physical death and acceptance of physical death with the issue of living without feeling truly alive, they destroyed any lasting value this film might have had.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|and I have been an Erykah Badu fan since the beginning.  Mama's Gun was an absolute masterpiece.  When I finished listening to Worldwide Underground I actually said out loud &quot;is that all?&quot;<br />Sorry guys and girls, can't say I was wowed with this one. I understand that she is trying to make some changes to her image, which I totally respect.  I view this album as a very forgiveable error.<br />Erykah is still my very favorite artist and more original than almost anyone in the business today, but when I think about how I waited 3 years for this album I really have to think.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The new A Perfect Circle cd is nothing short of amazing. That being said, this album is very different than Mer de Noms. It also takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but after awhile the melodies really get to you. My favorite tracks are: The Package, Blue, Pet, and Vanishing, but pretty much all of these songs are top notch.

B000056VPD|5.0|George Benson displays his range and ability from beginning to end on this great DVD.  The diversity of singing styles and musical genres is what makes this concert a standout.  The highlights are:<br />*The cover classic &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, where Benson shows his ability to perform old time pop music with the panache of Tony Bennett or Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole.  <br />*The accompaniment of Joe Sample tickling the ivories to Benson's instrumental rendition of Stevie Wonder's &quot;Lately&quot;.  The only thing that could've made it better was if George actually sang the lyrics of this all-time favorite of mine.  Nonetheless, it's an excellent performance.<br />*All the Benson hits were great.  &quot;This Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Turn Your Love Around&quot;, &quot;Give Me the Night&quot;, and &quot;On Broadway&quot;.  The absolute best, as always, was the performance of &quot;Breezin&quot;.<br />If your a George Benson fan or a fan of good music and concerts in general, &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; is definitetly worth the price.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|It's Interesting in the rolling stone review and in a review I read here both stated that &quot;The Nurse who loved me&quot; is the &quot;best song on the album&quot; rolling stone, or &quot;The most original song on the album&quot; Reviewer, and this song is acutually a cover song of a band called &quot;Failure&quot; (The greatest band ever i might add) <BR>Maynard was a big fan of &quot;Failure&quot; and on the cd-rom bit of the new &quot;Year of the Rabbit&quot; album Billy Howerdell interviews Ken Andrews who is the lead singer of Both bands<BR>check them out
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Once again  has  the members of  &quot;A perfect circle&quot;  come together  to  bring  some of the most  brilliant and hypnotic  music to life .  Fans  of &quot;mer de  noms&quot;  may find this  cd  to be slightly  slower  than  expected. But the  song structures  showcase  each  of  the musicians  ability  to play with grace and fury. But most of all i am glad to see that  ex  pumpkins guitarist &quot;james  iha&quot;  has joined  this  group. &quot;thirteenth  step&quot;  is a  must for anyone who enjoys  music that blends  bliss full  guitar melodies with hypnotic lyrics
0767903862|4.0|This was yet another fun outing with Mr. Bryson, although I must say, not quite as much fun as A Walk in the Woods.  Definitely enjoyable (and interesting), though, especially if you're a Bryson fan like me.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Bowies latest, &quot;reality&quot; is a very good one. You can put this album as the last insert to the trilogy consisting of &quot;...hours&quot;, &quot;heathen&quot;, and then finally &quot;Reality&quot;. This latest one however, is the best as far as songwriting goes. The songs are very strong and you can just hear how much effort and soul David put in it.A terrific rock album. I think it has been somewhat underrated by a lot of people so far but I think it deserves a lot of credit. Also lets give Davids excellent band a hand for such a great instrumental contribution shall we?
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Outstanding vocals, production, samples and guests make Worldwide Underground one of the most creative and refreshing cd's of late.  Cd sales aren't just low because of downloading....there's too much [not good] music out there.  However, Ms. Badu delivers quality with this release.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have come to accept long waits when it comes to A Perfect Circle and Tool.  I remember when Tool's 'Lateralus' came out.  The sound they had developed for the album was much more refinded.  It pushed Tool out of their old genre in my opinion.  A Perfect Circle has done a very similar thing with their second album 'Thirteenth Step'.  This album is quite more mellow than their debut, but don't let that fool you, APC still has what it takes to get their message across.  <BR>While I am still absorbing this album, I have to say that the song that has touched me is 'The Stranger'.  This song is just...WOW.  I just got done listening to it AGAIN.  Why haven't you got this album yet.  Go...BUY...NOW.
B00005A46T|4.0|This 2nd cd from Slipknot is a step in a different direction. Less grindcore/rap/breakbeat and more death and trash metal influences creep out on this one which makes for a brutally pleasent listening experience. I loved the 1st cd but &quot;Iowa&quot; is more up my alley. The songs flow better, the groove changes are just plain sic!! If you bought the 1st cd and liked it give this one a shot. But expect a darker, heavier, groovier listening experience.
B000031WD9|1.0|What kept me from hating this movie as much as I wanted to was the fact that two of my favorite stars (Tara Reid and Seann W. Scott) were in this. Otherwise, this movie was just a piece of junk. It's one of those ... teen movies that makes us all look like we're horny, sex-loving pervs! Not all teens are all about sex - a lot care about issues such as college, success, politics...you know what I'm getting at. Plus, Chris Klein bugged me. I used to think he was an okay guy and all, but after I watched this, I came to the conclusion that the only role that guy gets is the sweet but naive jock role! He must have a very bad agent or something to be getting these awful, camp roles. Either that or he's just a bad actor. I actually thought this would be a good movie! Whoah...was I WRONG! This was a terrible movie with a dumb plot. The only people who will enjoy this are teens who can't get it on or adults who never quite got over issues. Awful, awful movie.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  My wife watched it with me, and though it was over an hour long, we both wished it was an hour longer.<br />Roger talked about all 'his accomplishments' with an occasional pat on the back to rick or dave.  But the other members were more apt to talk about the groups contribution, and you can tell that the anger that existed/exists between everyone is not as top shelf as it was before.  Not that a reunion will ever happen but time heals everything.<br />The movie talked about how each song was made, and you get to see each song dissected into smaller pieces, and you can watch Dave play TIME and other songs on both electric guitar and acoustic guitar.. great stuff.  The highlight for me was watching Rick Wright -the most overlooked talent in the group- play his piano parts.. everything from US AND THEM to my ulitimate favorite THE GREAT GIG IN THE SKY.<br />Powerful DVD about a POWERFUL recording.<br />5 outta 5
B00007CVSH|4.0|Indeed, the principals are ideally cast here. Dmitri Hvorostovsky's suave, evil, yet somehow still-human Count nearly steals the show. He's far superior to all the Counts recorded. Jose Cura gives a believable performance as Manrico, even though he pays more attention to acting than to music. For instance, &quot;Ah si, ben mio&quot; is a bit choppy in sound, but acted out very well.<br />I really enjoyed Veronica Villaroel's Leonora. Like Cura, she put more emphasis on acting, but she managed some of the most difficult music with excellent artistry and skill. Brava!<br />Yvonne Naef looked and sang an ideal Azucena.<br />What kept distracting me was the staging. First of all, it looks like late 19th century Italy (vs. Austria), making Leonora's Tale D'Amor (a knight with an unmarked shield came, etc) along with many other story details quite improbable. Ferrando has a shaved head and looks too young to remember the events of the old days passed. Now, for the ugly:<br />1. When Azucena is captured, the &quot;warriors&quot; nearly rape (!) her onstage. This is inappropriate for Verdi's delicate, highly melodious music. Neither works the scene when Leonora and Manrico are in some sort of hay stack (okay, call me a purist but I thought it was low brow theater).<br />2. The strange sabre (schlager) dueling (the producers made a big fuss about it) does not add any value. The &quot;fighters&quot; look like made-up ballet dancers of some sort, they're wearing leather trappings more appropriate for a cult dance club they way Hollywood depicts them). Either include some real sabre or foil fencing or don't bother with &quot;authentications&quot; of this sort.<br />3. During the famous Anvil chorus, I surely did not see any anvils. (And Manrico smoked a cigar!)<br />4. Finally, when telling her hounting tale, Azucena is supposed to be pointing at a fire, or a place where there once was a fire. Needless to say, nothing of the kind is at sight. She just has to point at an empty space. Hmm...<br />Throughout the whole performance, I kept wishing for a traditional (yes) staging, so that it would be more believable.<br />Dante Ferretti is a well-known set designer for the movies and theater, but while opera staging can be minimalist it should not take away from the story.<br />I suggest getting this DVD for the great singing, most notably the wonderfully done Miserere and Il Balen. Carlo Rizzi does a splendid job, although a bit too brisk at some moments.<br />The DVD itself has a pretty good quality, but the booklet does not list the supporting roles, which is a shame because the singers gave exciting performances.<br />Throughout the whole performance, I kept wishing for a traditional (yes) staging, so that it would be more believable. <BR>Dante Ferretti is a well-known set designer for the movies and theater, but while opera staging can be minimalist it should not take away from the story.<BR>I suggest getting this DVD for the great singing, most notably the wonderfully done Miserere and Il Balen.

B000003N7G|5.0|In a time when jazz was becoming less popular, this four-part masterpiece recorded in 1964, is John Coltrane's attempt to give thanks to God. In doing so, and regardless of your religious beliefs, he delivers a performance in the company of McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass) and Elvin Jones (drums) that makes it clear what he meant when he said in 1966 he planned \\"to become a saint\\" in response to the question about his plans for the next decade. Sadly, he died of cancer not too long after that statement, but he left a legacy of work that -like this album- are testimony of what an inspired soul can let flow and give to others. Today, almost forty years after its original release, Coltrane's memory is alive and kicking and his timeless work continues to inspire musicians of all genres across the world. In my journey of discovery of this beautiful jazz music, this album has turned out to be a true musical revelation and I want to share it with you too.

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|i will do some of the other reviewers a favor and not compare this album to mer de noms, or tool.  <br />this was not what i had in mind for new a perfect circle.  don't let it throw you off:  the first three songs are incredible!  you almost think this is going to be the album of the year!  but then, track 4-8 hit...and not one of them is good.  the music is well recorded, but not well done.  maynard offers nothing new (he usually doesn't anyway).  then track 9 hits, which is the only original sounding song on the disc.  it's a slow, organ and piano like thing with maynard singing things you'd never think you'd hear coming out of his mouth.  track 10 is powerful, but leaves you wanting more.  then the last 2 tracks compare to 4-8.  <br />so if you want something a little better than this, go grab the underworld soundtrack.  it has a better version of the weak and powerless, a damning well song, and a great dillenger escape plan song, all better than anything on this disc.  of course, if you want good maynard, go for tool or that puscifer song on the underworld soundtrack.  add this cd to your collection only if you want it for collection purposes.
B00009V8Z9|2.0|am i the only person who thinks this album is on the verge of terrible.  out of 128 reviews, the lowest rating is 3 stars?!  i dont understand.  <BR>the sticker on the jewel case refers to gavin as new york's best kept secret.  maybe its just me but i think new york should have continued to keep its mouth shut.  ive heard much better in local coffee houses.
1404331964|4.0|Personally to be honest with you, this was one of the best books I've ever read for school, it explores the life of a man who starts out with only his faith, and then indulges into the lavish life of a rich woman. Making friends along the way this sort of &quot;cocky&quot; religous man finally encounters the real life. Kudos Hesse, Kudos

0090006801|5.0|I first read Currahee! when I was maybe 10 years old.  It was much different from the books on World War II that I had read, which up to then had either been from the point of view of a general or the godlike overview of the historian.<br />It was the first book on the war my Dad had fought that gave the point of view of the common soldier, although the paratroopers of the 506th were far from common.  Dad saw a great deal of combat and never talked about it.  Burgett gave me a feeling for what Dad must have gone through, and for that I was grateful.  It gave me an appreciation for the hardships of the front-line soldier's life unmatched by any book I've read, save possibly Mauldin's Up Front.<br />Anyone that wants to know what that war was like on a day to day basis at the sharp end should forget about things like Saving Private Ryan and the television specials with which Stephen Ambrose was involved.  This book will tell you all you need to know.  It cannot be recommended too highly.
B00000DCH9|5.0|I considered this album to be a great classic from Billy Joel. Every song is a real gem and it was the first album that proved what a good songwriter he was then and would become later on. This is a great album and I really enjoy it a great deal. It is my favorite Billy Joel album. My favorite songs on this CD are &quot;You're My Home&quot;, &quot;The Ballad Of Billy The Kid&quot; and &quot;Captain Jack&quot;. &quot;Piano Man&quot;, is the most well known song on this CD and it was his first big hit and although it is a good well written song it is not my favorite. Like I said this album is a classic and one of my favorite albums of all times.
B0000029GA|5.0|Every track is awesome. One of the top 5 rap CDs of alltime. Best song: Halftime.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|You have to be high to listen to this album or at least in a really good mood. It is not long enough and the although the beats are tight, the album might as well be instrumental since the words are repitive or not there at all. I am an avid Erykah Badu fan but this CD is DISAPPOINTING!!!
B0000039PW|5.0|This is Biggie's Greatest CD. In my opinion the second best CD OF ALL TIME. (Behind only 2pac's All eyez on me). Best song: The What feat. Method Man.
B00009P1O0|4.0|Half the songs sound like they were recorded at 5AM when all the musicians are half asleep. It's really raw, even by Neil Young/Crazy Horse standards.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This was an album that i waited for a long time to listen. I would love to have been there to witness metallica perform the best show ever. Unlike others who claim to be fans of metallica, i had great faith in the capabilities of metallica, that i ventured to say at that time, metallica is just the band to pull off a stunt like this. They have the type of music that can fit in anywhere. Now to go to more important matters like the album, i think there should have been more space for unforgiven 1 &amp; 2. The output on the cd is not as good as being really there as some of the songs have lots of singing by the crowd. That gets a bit irritating. but if u play it loud enough and sing along with the crowd, u feel the energy flowin through you. i garentee it that u'll enjoy the best ever onstage show recorded. One of the unique features of this album is that it was done without any practice. It was sort of a &quot;go play and harmonize&quot;, just like that. Nothing else matters was even better than the original. That should be enough persuasion for anyone to buy this album. The hero of the day was excellent onstage with the ochestra led by Micheal Kamen. The ochestra was perfectly jibing in with the notes of perfect metal. Buy this album if you are a metallica fan and if ur not buy it anyway caus itz worth havin. it can really make u appreciate this album.
B000084T18|5.0|This is a really good 50 cent CD. He has so many of his great songs on this one CD, which is pretty cool. This is one of my favorite CDS and i never get sick of it. I most highly reccomend it to every one.
B00003CXTF|2.0|The director and producers seem to have followed a recipe called 'How to make a blockbuster'. <br />- Take two attractive young men that guys want to be and girls want to date. <BR>- Add a love interest. <BR>- Pack in lots of action sequences that have worked in other hit movies. <br />Pearl Harbor is another one of those hollywood films where they feel that portraying the historical events accurately isn't exciting enough and so they need to be fictionalized in some way. If you're looking for a history of the Attack on Pearl Harbor then see Tora! Tora! Tora! and if you are looking for a decent action film then there are plenty of others to choose from.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is one of my favorite artists. I loved him even more after he came out with this CD. It is so good, even better than the first one (&quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;) I highly reccomend this CD to every one. There are some good mellow songs and some greatup-beat ones. BUY THIS CD NOW.
B000059HGY|4.0|The attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday December 7, 1941 was one of the most signifcant events of the 20th century. It secured US entry into World War II which in turn helped in the victory in Europe over Nazi Germany. <br />A key feature of this movie is that it was a joint American-Japanese production and hence gives both perspectives and a balanced picture of the story. It is both a historically accurate account of the events and also a gripping and watchable film. <br />The first half of the movie maps out the events leading up to the attack, the question of why it happened is an important point for any event in history but particularly in this case. <BR>The movie's second half is a stunning recreation of the devastating battle. Considering when it was filmed the effects of the battle compare favourably with those of the far more recent Pearl Harbor directed by Michael Bay.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Haper has many many great CDs, but this has to be the best one. I would also reccomend &quot;Live from Mars.&quot; but this is a very good album of his newest stuff. I saw him play a lot of these songs in concert and he was great. I higly reccomend this CD.
B00005JM1Y|5.0|So you love James Bond, and you love a good spoof: great!  See this movie.  I was cracking up in the first thirty seconds of the film, and the opening credits are funnier than the entirety of some so-called comedies I have seen.<br />You understand the plot: all of the MI7 agents have been killed at a funeral, and fourth-string Johnny English is called in to investigate the pilfering of the Crown Jewels.  Fairly simple, but you want to watch Atkinson work his magic.  Yes, this film atones for the miserable Mr. Bean Movie.<br />This film has something for everyone: action, subtle roman and sexual tension, and intelligent comedy.  In addition to the opening credits, there is one scene that captures the essence of the comedy.  Johnny English is in the office getting his badge, an filling out his secret agent paperwork, when he accidentally shoots the secretary with a dart pen.  A sub-normal comic would have left the joke end there, but Atkinson and Co. stretch eh humor out as English watches the paramedics come in and resuscitate the poor damsel.<br />As to nudity, there is one scene of an Archbishops bottom that goes on a little too long, and there is a scene where Johnny English climes up a sewer into a castles outhouse.  Other than these two scene, the is absolutely no vulgarity.  We can safely call this a Mormon alternative to Austin Powers.<br />I t is appropriate that Rowan Atkinson played the James Bond spoof, since he had a quick bit in Never Say Never Again.  Mike Myers never had such a claim.
B000002UZ6|4.0|The first thing I noticed about this collection, is that I knew twice as much as I thought I did, knew it well, and really liked it. I like all kinds of music, and &quot;Tina Turner&quot; and the 80's are a great combination. Not only does this contain the big hits &quot;What's Love Got to do with it&quot;, &quot;Typical Male&quot;, and &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, but the other gems &quot;Better be Good to Me&quot; and &quot;What you Get is What you See&quot;. All of these I practically knew note for note. PLUS a cover of &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot;, and the excellent &quot;We Don't Need Another Hero&quot; from &quot;Mad Max 3&quot;. The only thing I really miss is her duet with Bryan Adams, &quot;It's Only Love&quot;. Otherwise, this is simply the best.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I seen these reviews and I have a question.  To the people who didn't think that the dialouge meant anything, why did the half people on this website think it DID mean something? Are you missing out on something here?? Obviously.  If you paid attention and used your brain, you would realize what these people were saying, its not rocket science to figure out the dialouge (to some it is).  The plot and the dialouge and everything was great, I have never watch a movie more thought provoking than this one.  Some of these people say The Bros. used cheap philosophy, what are you talking about?  They are incorporating ancient and modern philophosy into their own unimaginable world!! You try and do that, then you can critique!  The story is a great continuation of the first, where Neo goes into the depths of the Matrix, and finds lots of things that you and he would never suspect.  But after all, its only a matter of opinion, but alot of people give bad reviews because they can not fully comprehend what is going on. But, that is why it is called the \\"matrix.\\" Did you think it would be easy to understand? This is a thinking man's movie, you need to use your brain.  From looking at the reviews here, its seems most people don't like to do that.
B00006LLNU|4.0|By all rights, Sigur Ros' second album ( ) should be the biggest load of pretentious claptrap ever released. The album has no title and there are no official song titles or liner notes, in order for the listener to &quot;get in touch&quot; with the music, the band is backed by an orchestra, the lyrics are sung in a made-up language composed of a few syllables, and the songs are LONG. Really long--about 8 minutes on average. Sounds like something the worst progressive bands of the 70's would do. Right?<br />Wrong. The concept may be suspect at first, but Sigur Ros deliver in spades with some of the most beautiful, chilling, saddening soundscapes imaginable. Each track moves at a glacial pace, filling your ears with perfectly placed piano, drums, bass and strings, while the distortion and cascading feedback of the bowed guitars give the music an otherworldly aura. Singer Jonsi floats over top, with his ethereal, Thom Yorke-esque voice. Forget trying to make any sense out of the &quot;Hopelandic&quot; language, as it really isn't a &quot;language&quot; as such. Instead, just treat Jonsi's voice as another instrument, a la early REM or Cocteau Twins. Clever concept, but it's been done better by other artists.<br />Each composition flows into each other without feeling too samey. Dynamics are put to great use, most notably on the last two songs. The first half of the album seems to be &quot;lighter&quot; and dreamlike, while the second half is &quot;darker,&quot; more haunting. To a punk or pop listener, the songs will be too long, too hookless, and boring. This is not an album for short attention spans, or for people looking for background music. If you listen to the songs carefully, each will have its own reward. Track 3 is a song fit for a eulogy, its spiraling piano melody suggesting ascension into heaven. Track 4 is an expression of joy, while tracks 6 and 7 are a slow, dark descent before the final track, which ends in a breathtakingly powerful climax. The band clearly knows how to save the best for last.<br />Comparisons to Godspeed You Black Emperor and Mogwai are frequent, but I think Sigur Ros is closer to the winter equivalent of My Bloody Valentine, especially the album Loveless. While My Bloody Valentine's warm flurry of white noise recalls a vibrant summer day, Sigur Ros' music is best listened to on a quiet snowy night. ( ) is highly recommended to fans of progressive music or anyone looking for something unique.clearly knows how to save the best for last. <br />Comparisons to Godspeed You Black Emperor and Mogwai are frequent, but I think Sigur Ros is closer to the winter equivalent of My Bloody Valentine, especially the album Loveless.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|I have been reading these reviews and notice one thing: Either you love it or you hate it.  It funny to read what some of these people say, it has no meaning, or the dialouge has no meaning, or it has no plot. Its funny because if the movie didnt have those things, why would ANYONE like it?? How is it that the people who like it think that the dialouge is great, the plot was interesting, and it has tons of meaning behind it and the people who hated it didnt think it had anything? The people who hate it dont understand it. Its been said many times, but its true.  If you just do not like the whole concept, thats one thing.  But these people just dont see it. <BR>  I dont understand how people can not see it.  Doesnt the plot hit you in the face right at the beginning when Neo says to Trinity, \\"I wish I knew what to do\\"??? Or do you not see that it is the plot(well part of it)? This guy is god in the Matrix, yet he has no idea what to do with his new powers. Its like a person having the most wicked tennis game known to man, but he will never find a tennis court to play on. What does he do? How is he going to find out what to do? He has to rely on the Oracle, a person that we thought we knew, but we didn't(don't want to ruin the movie for the other people). Who really is the Oracle?? Is she on our side or theirs? Is she a form of control?  The plot thickens. She sends Neo on a mission that she says will end the war. Should we believe her? Is she sending neo to the right path? How will this end the war? Who is the Merovigian? Who is the Keymaker? <BR> Ill stop there. That seems like a plot to me, and that is only the mere beginning.  Theres a lot of philosophical references which the Oracle and the Merovigian use to try to break down the matrix to Neo. In my opinion, very interesting stuff, but if you don't like philosphy, you probably wont enjoy those scenes and thats ok.  What is sickening though is the people who say the movie is bad because they dont understand it, and it is so obvious.  Watch the movie again and pay attention, use your brains.

B00006690G|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about Eminem. He certainly is one of (if not the) most talented lyricists and performers of all time, and has changed the face of stereotypical rap music forever. His most recent release, \\"The Eminem Show\\" is no different, although it showcases a much deeper maturity and understanding of his past and those who played major roles in it. Peppered with raunchy skits and references to the major headlines over the past few years, \\"The Eminem Show\\" does not disappoint fans, but rather shows them a different side of the controversial superstar. Every song, although displaying the good ol' Eminem that America has come to love (and hate), has a different message and feel to it. From retaliation (shown in songs such as \\"White America\\", and \\"When The Music Stops\\") to angry, dizzingly clever (such as \\"Til I Collapse) and playful (like \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" and \\"Square Dance\\") this album gives you a sharp kick in the face with awesome lyrics and beats produced by the amazing Dr. Dre from start to finish. Although (as I stated before) it is more mature than any other of his CDs, it still has those select few songs you will be sure Tipper Gore will be tearing apart any day now. In a showcase of how little money he spends on mother's day, he rips his mom in the vicious and genius \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\", and in \\"Drips\\", he and D12 bandmate Obie Trice rap about graphic sex and the consequences of which. My favorites on the record would include \\"Sing For The Moment\\" (an amazing adaptation of Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\"), \\"When The Music Stops\\", \\"Business\\", and \\"Til I Collapse\\", although every song is pure gold. As I said in the beginning, I have nothing bad to say about Eminem, and this album gives me no excuse to. Bottom line: It's awesome.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Brother Maynard comes up short on APC's sophomore album. I was a little bummed that the band took to a more mainstream sound rather then the familiar dark and experimental sound that follows Maynard and his work, but its still an album worth buying if you're a fan.
B000066F6H|5.0|Wow! what an original and exciting Album. Every song is enjoyable, which is something I don't say much. The whole album is full of energy. When I first listened to some Hives I just thought about how annoying the singers voice was. Eventually I got used to it and I realized how great this music is! A must buy!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I haven't seen many musicals on Broadway, Chicago is one.  I enjoyed the stage version very much, but the film is superior.  It is all about the way the film is edited, seamlessly moving back and forth between reality and the inside of Roxy's head.  It is a lot of fun contrasting between the harsh reality of 1930s Chicago and the fantasy world of Roxy Hart.  This had a lot of 'train wreck' potential, but the directors pulled it off wonderfully.<br />Several have commented about the plot.  Okay, I'll admit it too, the plot is weak and a bit far fetched, but isn't that typical of a musical?  Has anyone ever actually seen a bunch of sailors going off on shore leave and breaking into song while standers by join in (On the Town)?  Do you really believe that a whole town could be sucked in to buy musical instruments from a man that can't play a note (Music Man)?  Haven't you heard of suspending reality?  Chicago is different because it does the most convincing job of integrating the musical numbers into the story line.  <br />Get the DVD.  Watch the transformation between reality and fantasy.  Notice the difference between how Roxy imagines Billy F, and the way he really is.  This movie is fun, the music is memorable, Bob Fosse would have almost been pleased.
B00006F83Y|4.0|What a great CD. It is much less diverse than R but to me that makes it more enjoyable. The hole CD has a very cartoony feel too it. Not going to attract as many fans as R but hey it is still very good music. It is very frustrating at times to have to listen too the boring and pointless fake radio chat witch can keep you from lstening to music. Overall thought it is very enjoyable and I recommend it to any QOTSA fan.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maybe 4.5 stars would be more accurate, anyways... like some many others my expectations were HIGH. Simply because Mer De Noms was such a great album but also because the leaked live tracks for this album was of such a high quality. I'm not really sure of what my final opinion of the album as I have just heard it through for the first time. But yes, it does seem to lack something. The most obvious thing to me is the production. The sound is not as rich as before and the drums does not sound as good either. Then there are the two instrumentals. They're a real downer for me cause.. this album have been in the making for a long time, so there must (and there are) other songs. Why did they put those two tracks on the album? I really can't say. Also, I was expecting The Nurse Who Loved Me to be really different having heard their live version, but then again it may grow on me.<br />I feel that this album could have been so much better and much better than Mer De Noms had they not put those filler instrumentals on it, had the production been slightly different and if there had been more songs on it or longer songs. The reason why I think it could have been better than Mer De Noms is that the remaining ten songs are SO good. Really. You must check it out.
B00004TH6O|4.0|When I first bought this CD after hearing stuff from Songs for the Deaf and Queens of the Stone Age, I was a bit disappointed. The songs were heavier on the other albums and this seemed so light compared to the other two. After listening for a couple of times I began to enjoy it more and more. My favorites are Feel good hit of the Summer, (although it does get a little draining by the end)Lost Art of Keeping a secret, Auto Pilot, The very very interesting To the Quick and to the Pointless, and Tension head. Although more diverse than the other two albums I still enjoy Songs for the Deaf more. A must buy.
B000002UAF|5.0|In my opinion, this captures the sound and the energy of what the Beatles are most remembered for.  Everything after this was downhill.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie is a much better film than the first one. The action is fun and great, the actors are top of the line and the story is actually good, so it's not just about special effects.
0345350499|5.0|I was working as a midwife in Berkeley when this book was published. One of my patients was a friend of Marion Zimmer Bradley - and she came to the home birth. Whoa, were the rest of us impressed to have her among us? Yup! I'd already read the book, and although it was about 20 yrs ago, I still remember many of the details vividly. And I'm not even a fan of fantasy books.<BR>Bradley took the liberty of recreating the Arthurian legend with the women as the main characters. They are the creators of like, the keepers of knowledge, the fonts of spirituality, the holders of the keys to the kingdom. The Mists of Avalon, however, is more than a rewrite of the old legend. It's a scholarly exploration of the lesser known issues of religion, medicine, and power during the Middle Ages. The author accomplished a spectacular success in this book not just by weaving an expertly told story, but also by constructing a mythical time and place so effectively that readers have trouble believing that every detail is not the literal truth. The quality and depth of the research that obviously went into this book is astounding, and it can therefore be read on many levels. Where truth, myth, legend, and pure fiction meet and diverge is very difficult to say.<BR>If you haven't already read this masterpiece, do it now.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I'm truly sorry for those few poor souls who couldn't find it in themselves to fall absolutely head-over-heels in love with this incredible film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's book. That they cannot share in the utter and absolute joy the rest of us feel at having witnessed the cinematic miracle that Peter Jackson and crew have accomplished with, literally, their blood, sweat and tears - for four long years. I wish they could be walking on the same clouds I'm walking on, for having lived long enough to experience this lifelong dream of seeing their most beloved book brought to the big screen with such style and verve!<br />By the way: really liked the movie!

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i have learned in the past that albums that u listen to once and dislike have a very good chance of becoming one of your favorites down the road. the songs sound like nothing else, so u gotta let them sink in before u can write a real review. I was thinkin about only giving it 4 starts, but i realized i'll risk it and trust my intuition. &quot;The Outsider&quot; seems to be my stand out track so far. amazing harmony, and original song structure, just like the rest of the album. buy it. and give it time.
B000002VCU|5.0|One of the best albums from The Alan Parsons Project, my feel to it is an inverse to 'Ladyhawke' film. If the lattest was a rock soundtrack for a medieval film, this resembles to quote modern life with many medieval musical elements.<br />The proof of that is the opening horns in 'May Be a Price to Pay'. A superb instrumental introduction leads to the strong voice of Elmer Gantry. The words add also a medieval thematic speaking about sorcerers, masters and servants. There's a great orchestral part in the middle with very much melisma and a big feel of adventure!! The next song, 'Games People Play' is a good hit sung by Lenny Zakatek, a very dynamic pop-rock song. 'Time' is a classic and the first attempt of Eric Woolfson as a lead vocalist. It's a very deep and dramatic song, enforced by the beautiful orchestral arrangements. 'I Don't Wanna Go Home' is the classic crazy song in every record of the Project, properly sung by the expressive and theatric Lenny Zakatek.<br />The second side is even better. 'The Gold Bug' is a very interesting instrumental that goes in crescendo with some instruments being gradually added, like saxophone, haunting voices and synthesisers. It was almost copied in the next album with 'Mammagamma' but this is much more genuine and authentic. The next is a suite of 5 movements. 'The Turn of a Friendly card' is two versions of a beautiful ballad, the first more narrative and the last more dramatic and based in the instruments. 'Snake Eyes' is the most evident song touching the theme of gambling. 'Ace of Swords'is another medieval musical reference to the whole, linking with the gambling theme. It's a very upbeating theme full of quality arrangements by Andrew Powell. And 'Nothing Left to Lose' is a little but wonderful ballad with very warm and consolating lyrics for the &quot;defeated warrior&quot;. The end of the album is like pesimistic but with an optimistic look to the future. I don't know if there is really a conclusion to the album, but the feel at the end is a little bitter-sweet. Anyway, this is a masterpiece of symphonic rock and a good one for getting started with the Project, as well as 'Eye in the Sky'.the feel at the end is a little bitter-sweet. Anyway, this is a masterpiece of symphonic rock and a good one for getting started with the Project, as well as 'Eye in the Sky'.
B000002UAO|2.0|There are 5 songs out of 14 here that are really good - Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, In My Life, and If I Needed Someone. John wrote 3, George wrote one and the other is a Lennon/McCartney collaboration.  The rest of the CD is only adequate, as songs like Run for Your Life and What Goes On are just below par, and Michelle and You Won't See Me are easy listening songs. <br />I prefer the albums pre-Rubber Soul.<br />5 songs out of 14 is worth 1.8 stars.
B00003000M|2.0|There is a lot of good stuff on this CD, and it is enjoyable to listen too.  However, the re-make artists' vision and the Bob vision clash horribly.  Bob had a completely different approach to fighting for rights and equality than these re-make artists do, and I find it very disrespectful to Bob and his life to twist his songs in this manner.  As I said, there is some good musical stuff here, but I find it unpleasant to listen to because it's not right to do something like that to Bob's vision.  His songs were masterpieces in themeselves, and they deserve to be appreciated in their original beauty.
B0000DBJDL|5.0|When I think of my favorite video concerts, two in particular come to mind. \\"U2 at Red Rocks\\" and \\"Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii\\". The reason? LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! How can you beat the early, classic Floyd line-up actually setting their gear up in the empty ruins of Pompeii (i.e., no audience), jamming out their awesome pre-\\"Dark Side\\" material as the day's sun sets in the distance?? Then the huge spotlights come on, and they continue playing as night falls around them. No overdubs (unlike most, if not all, of today's \\"live\\" concert vids), and one of the best Floyd performances you'll ever hear. It all makes for quite a \\"heady\\" experience (if you know what I mean - so be sure to enjoy whatever it is you like to enjoy with this show!) Added bonus: in-studio interviews and clips of them making \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (to be expanded-upon in this DVD edition). A captivating experience - I can only imagine how awesome the DVD version of this will be!!
B0000AR8NK|4.0|The only way I know how to rate an album is song by song.  Here is how I rate the songs from top to bottom, 11 songs in total.  5,5,4,2,3,3,5,5,4,4,3.  Total is 43 out of 55 possible points. A very solid 4 out of 5 stars. The now unemployed former East German Judge would be around 35 points(still not bad) with the U.K. Judge coming in around 50 points. <BR>Although I have enjoyed the last few Bowie albums, this is the one that really gets my attention.  It is very good!  Boy, a couple of these songs just can't be ignored by the radio stations-even the pop top 40 stations.  &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;New Killer Star&quot; are bonifide hits if played.  Mr. Bowie may not be striving for top 40 hits at the moment, but I sure think he has two of them. This album has rock and soul, a little classic Beatles, a little classic Bowie, and alot new Bowie.  The album artwork is &quot;cool&quot;, my favorite of all David Bowie albums.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, begins immediately from where it ended in the Fellowship of Ring.  It is a suspenseful sequel quite worthy of Best Picture of the year.  Frodo Baggins starts to fall to the Ring itself, but a strong companion, Sam, helped him keep moderate control of himself.  Meanwhile, Aragon and his two companions search nonstop for the other two Hobbits that were imprisoned by Sauroman's army.  Soon, the war for Middle Earth will begin and time is running low for Frodo.  The honorable sequel ends with the first battle of the war--The Battle of Helmes Deep.  The only thing that can save the great fort is hope.  Bonds will be broken and retied in this movie.  Brace yourself for an action-packed adventure that makes this one of the best sequels filmography has ever produced!
B000002VC3|4.0|Although Eye in the Sky is not the best album from the Project, it was the most succesful one and at the same time the most recommended for anybody who hasn't listened to a world record by this huge band.<br />This is the first album not having a common conceptual link including every song. But there's still a sense of unity between all of them. 'Sirius' opens it. A low synthesiser chord appears from nowhere, a delayed guitar plays a constant riff and the drums, bass and guitar burst together in a very grandious way until a rythm starts and fades away, leading to 'Eye in the Sky'. This famous song owes it success to its sensitive singing by Eric Woolfson and the catchy chorus in which the soothing voices of Chris Rainbow add beauty with these &quot;looking at yooouu&quot; phrases.<br />An abrupt drum and electric guitar rythm announce 'Children of the Moon', a song that shows how complex and interesting a song from the Project can be. This is a song that comes from nowhere to an exciting chorus full of voices, orchestra and a very medieval trumpet. The words speak about the disappointing politics and how vulnerable we feel in the hands of powerful dehumanised gents. The song disappears into 'Gemini', a beautiful demonstration of scottish Chris Rainbow's soft voice sung almost a-capella.<br />'Silence and I' is a rather serious song, a very sad one and a classic ballad from the Project sung by Eric Woolfson again. The words allude to some sad childhood memory and the gloomy feel they leave you with is abruptly interrupted by a gorgeous medieval-like orchestra section. Suddenly you get into an upbeat rythm that makes you feel you're in the middle of an adventurous medieval movie (Ladyhawke?). The arrangements from Andrew Powell are great, and this is like the sad boy takes refuge into a dream in which he is a powerful warrior... but we're back to reality and the song returns to its beginning and ends with a very melancholic cascade of orchestral notes.<br />The second side is much more shallow in its thematic and musically heavier as well. That's proved by the fine rocker 'You're Gonna Get You Fingers Burned'. Usually the most loosely and aggresive songs from the project are sung by the Pakistani-rooted Lenny Zakatek. 'Psychobabble' is a strange song full of eccentric lyrics, and has the feel of a scary movie.<br />'Mammagamma' is said by Alan Parsons to be a track almost only played by a computer. It's as famous as 'Lucifer' or 'I Robot'.<br />'Step by Step' is a remarkable song although hidden in the structure of the album. It's got an original 12-string guitar solo from which the strange sound comes from the idea from Ian Bairnson to plug the guitar directly on the mixing desk not on the amp. The last song, Old and Wise, is apparently sad but Eric Woolfson said its lyrics have a very positive mean. The song is poetic and soft, almost a soft lament, and the oboe in the beginning leads you to a melodramatic romantic film soundtrack feeling. The ending of the song is very strongly emotional, with a great saxophone solo.<br />This is a remarkable album.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Don't let other reviewers talk you out of this one!  Do you let people dictate your decisions!?!<br />This CD is probably the best thing I have heard in a long time.  People keep comparing it to their last album &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; and the thing is, you want a band to sound different on each CD or it gets stale.  If you want to keep listening to the sound sound, pick up Linkin Park or Staind.  All of their songs follow the same lame formula.<br />The harder rythms of this CD is a good change.  Stop comparing it to TOOL because it's not TOOL, it's A Perfect Circle.   The songs are more beautiful and ever.  The words that are sung is a great translation to the music.  If you happen to see this CD, pick it up and listen to it because I cannot give it any justice it deserves!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I am a very big maynard fan and i thought this cd was very good considering its not supposed to be a hard cd like all of Tool's cds. Maynard wasnt looking to have another band like Tool he wanted to try something different with his voice. So as i say again this cd isnt a hard cd with the exception of some parts of the package, weak and powerless, the outsider(easily best song on cd), and pet. APC shows Maynards excellent voice in a diferent respect. Overall a good cd. .....WHEN IS TOOL COMING OUT WITH NEXT CD!!!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Run...no, FLY....to pick up this sister's CD!  Erykah always manages to reinvent herself while never disappointing her listeners.  In a nutshell, this sister shines on this CD!  If you aren't already hooked by the booming tuba-like bassline of &quot;Danger&quot;, then maybe she'll pull you in with the 'freakquency&quot; of  her flow right into &quot;Think Twice.&quot;  &quot;Back In The Day (Puff)&quot; and &quot;I Want You,&quot; are as close to ballads as you'll get on this masterpiece, but the funk and smoothness of these tracks will have you wanting to hit your repeat button. <br />This is Erykah like you haven't heard her before, and even with this CD on repeat you won't get enough.  Her lyrics are simple, but fresh.  Her production is outstanding, and the texture and layering of the tracks is superb.    Play this CD with Freakquency!
B00003CX9E|1.0|I have had the displeasure of seeing this movie twice.  It had no story, the acting was bad and it did not hold the viewer's attention in any way.  The only people i recommend it to are insomniacs becuase this one's gonna put you to sleep quick. the ending is downright stupid, rosebud ooh a sled..oh no i ruined the ending..well i dont care, i did you all a favor by sparing you the agony of having to watch this piece of cinema filth.
B0000259IF|1.0|If Iggy Pop's idea of &quot;restoring&quot; a classic protopunk album is cranking it up 30dB in the digital domain, so that it clips beyond belief and completely trashes the audio, then he succeeded.  Seriously, this album is ruined by digital distortion -- you could just as easily have &quot;restored&quot; the old CD yourself by running it through a cheap guitar distortion pedal.  Actually, the result probably would have been better.<br />The CD doesn't sound &quot;modern,&quot; it doesn't sound &quot;hot,&quot; it doesn't &quot;rock.&quot;  There are no dynamics at all on this version, everything is maximum volume and distorted all the time.  So in the climax of the song, when Iggy screams, it's no louder than when the song started, leaving a person completely unmoved.  By then most people have tuned out the song anyway, since the lack of dynamics causes a loss of interest.  Stay away from this CD.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|It starts off very different from Mer De Noms. But by the end of the 1st song, you get sucked in and are kept there, even if your in your car, the minute you stop it, you have to take it out and put it into your personal player. Thats how good this cd is...its not hard like Mer De Noms, it alot softer, which would turn most hard rock/metal fans off, but its still APC and kind of like Tool's last cd. Its nice to finally here something different then the pop rock thats on the radio. Thank the music industry that they finally got APC to put a new album out.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has mastered storytelling it would seem. Their voice casting is second to none. Their animation is beyond the competition. All of which they manage to prove once again here.<br />Albert Brooks voice displays the perfect angst as a father in search of his lost son. Ellen Degeneres absolutely steals the show as Dory, the sidekick with short-term memory problems.<br />The artists at Pixar have built, in a short time, a catalogue of films that would make anyone envious. This is no exception. It is, perhaps, their best work yet.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|There's nothing else to say, except that this is an amazing album. Another great success! Although it's their 13th album, they're not tired yet, not even close! <BR>Bruce is singing amazingly as always. On this album I really like the guitar and keyboard introes, and the rhytm section too. The lyrics are fantastic, true Maiden-stuff, a bit historical.

6305327084|5.0|I remember renting this movie a few years ago just basically because there wasn't anything else that looked to interesting and for some reason this just kind of jumped out of me.  I'm glad it did because this is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  The writing is very clever, very natural sounding and the acting is great to serviceable.  Timothy Hutton does a great job as the lead character who's returned home for a reunion, but also seeking an answer as to what the next step in his life should be.  But, without question, Natalie Portman put Hollywood on notice in this moive that she was going to be a huge star.  There aren't many young ladies who could've stolen a scene or two much less a whole movie of this caliber.  She takes what could've very easily been a throw away part without a lot of substance and turns it into something that makes you realize you're seeing a truly special actress.  The scenes with Hutton and her are adorable, real, and heartbreaking all at the same time.  Their conversation about Winnie the Pooh while she ice skates is some of the best writing in the film.  Definitely check this movie out if you're a Natalie Portman fan, a Timothy Hutton fan, or if you just want to see a small movie that places an importance on dialogue and character development over massive explosions.
B000002GY9|5.0|I first heard this album when it came out in 1977 and listened to it until the grooves turned white.  26 years later, I bought the CD, more out of curiosity and respect for Waits' genius than a burning need to own.  Man oh man, was I wrong ... the album still holds up and sounds fresh after a quarter century.  No one can wallow in moon-in-the-gutter imagery better than Waits, and rather than play it as a cartoon, you know that for Tom it's genuine and the emotions are as raw as that phlegmatic voice.  The term &quot;masterpiece&quot; is used too often and hence is in danger of meaning nothing, but this album restores its definition.  Buy it if you're looking for something different, for that time when Waits was still within reach of most of us.  [I highly recommend &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; as well.]
0385504209|5.0|For anyone who doesn't rate this book 5 stars, get over it.  I read the books months ago in the first printing and immediately told everyone I knew to read it.  Its simply the most entertaining book of the year.  Is it accurate? Not 100%, but then again Eco's works on the history of the church while far more tedious are not 100% accurate either.  If anyone had bothered to read any other works by Brown they would know that being 100% accurate loses out to entertainment at times.  This is a work of fiction.  That means he made it up.  As Gore Vidal says, you can do and say anything in fiction because its not real.  If you want to battle through tedium (I have) read Eco, but don't beieve all of it.  If you want entertainment read Brown. Read his other works too, but for God's sake don't begin to think this is hitorically accurate, its fiction!
0784011176|5.0|I missed this movie in the theaters 10 years ago, and saw it for the first time purely by chance on HBO recently.  I was so enchanted that I watched each of the next three showings in the very same day, and then bought the DVD for my collection. It is one of the most unique, truly deep, thought provoking, awe-inspiring, movies I've seen in a while. The drama is almost Biblical, the love story almost Shakespearian in quality (think Othello).  I was enraptured by the music, the crashing waves, and the amazing synergy between the players. <br />And Harvey Keitel - who knew?  Those gangster/tough guy roles just don't even touch this man's talent. George Baines is intense, tender, passionate, a total jerk - so it would seem - but underneath the gruff exterior lies the heart of a prince. Keitel really puts it all out there, literally and figuratively. It's a risky role and it works for him.<br />Holly Hunter was spectacular, as usual, but in this film the fast-talking, high-energy woman you came to know in \\"Broadcast News\\" or \\"Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom\\" must dig deep. Ada's silences surpass powerful, she conveys more with her facial expressions than most people say out loud in a lifetime. Speech is clearly an overrated and overused form of communication. Ada's will is almost a character onto itself. And one can see clearly that no one is more surprised by her emerging emotions and unfolding events than she.<br />Sam Neill's character is sad, broken, pathetic, frightening, and your basic worst nightmare all at once.  Jealousy is indeed and ugly and and devastating emotion.<br />I disagree with a few of the other reviewers about Anna Paquin's character, Flora.  Some saw Flora as innocent. Watch closely. She's diabolical, almost schizophrenic. She has the wide-eyed, innocent visage of a pathological liar. Note the scene with the photograph, the dog under the porch, her conversations with the other women in the village (where you begin to see her turn on her mother as she realizes that she's being replaced as the center of her mother's universe) and when her final act of betrayal results in horrific violence (don't think for a second that she didn't know what she was doing), then note her repentence, and subsequent absolution (the soiled angel wings in the river), and her redemption.  Miss Paquin could never be considered a \\"child star\\" she's already shown more maturity than many adults in film today.<br />And of course, the Piano, the center of it all, Ada's voice, the music in this movie is so moving and expressive, so perfect for each scene. My next purchase is the soundtrack.<br />In sum, heart-achingly beautiful, devastatingly real and dream-like all at once.  I highly recommend.
0060934913|5.0|This is the story of a ne'er-do-well who went from a life of private schools and Summers in France to debauchery to two star chefdom.  You may know him best from \\"A Cook's Tour,\\" on FoodTV; the show has that inimitable cockiness of what one might imagine from a life-of-privlege mixed with a life on the edge.  I found the cockiness of the show a little off-putting.  Well, ... a lot off-putting.  So, I bought his book.<br />Bourdain gives a compelling story of Anyman.  If you've ever worked in a restaurant for any length of time, you can feel the characters of the restaurant leap off the pages.  So many of us have had to supplement a college education or a teaching gig or a crappy job by working in the restaurant business .  Bourdain does a fine job of recreating that experience, with the added benefit of giving the back story of the characters that we sorely misunderstood, or were, horrors, afraid of.  Easy read.  Requires no mental agility to digest.  Lots-O-Fun.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Blood on the Tracks, an already classic album, just got better with this SACD hybrid version. The 5.1 surround mix is wonderfully clear, revealing lots of previously hidden details, especially in the numbers Dylan recorded with Eric Weissburg &amp; Deliverance. The vocals are crisp and fill the room like never before. The overall experience is like hearing this album again, but in the studio, sitting in between the musicians as they play.<br />The only thing is that the packaging, though much better than the original CD version, is not up to the same standards as Sony's own Legacy re-issues. A song-by-song analysis (like the ones for the Byrds, for example) would've been nice--and that goes for most of the classic albums of this Dylan re-issue series, unfortunately.<br />Still, it's a must-have, if you're any kind of Dylan fan at all...
B000002JPA|5.0|The progressive/fusion album I would take with me on the moon, or wherever I may go. I may rate this album the most beautiful album of the last 25 years, 50 years, hundred years, I don't know. I have listened to it thousands times and never get tired of . I don't know another album I listened that much. There are days, weeks, months, periods when I can't listen to nothing else, so I put this cd on and listen to it in loop, from its beginning to its end all day long. There's not a single note I would change in this album even if I could. It is so perfect. It is perfect. Perfection at its best.  Perfection beyond perfection. Just one adjective more. Perfect.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is exactly what i thought it would be every song flows really good and the guitar sounds are just amazing great atmosphere on this entire cd. The instrumentals are a little lame but only becuase you sit there wanting more songs instead of short clips. But overall the songs are all good at some point. Props once again to Maynard and Bully for creating a masterpeice.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer Mer De Noms over Thirteenth Step. I think A Perfect Circle should have had more hard tracks, and whats up with the two tracks that are about 5 seconds long hmm? <br />Anyway, yes I DO recommend this album for any fan of theirs because it is a great album.
0385504209|5.0|This book is topnotch, although a bit laden with schmaltz. I loved it anyways.
B00005JLZN|4.0|I love most all of what Kevin Spacey does, as well as this one. But, let's be honest guys: when you saw the R rating on the back of the case for nudity and sexuality, weren't you just praying it was Kate Winslet in her full glory, like she was in the movie, Jude, and the other one where she plays a girl seduced by a cult, dressed up in bedsheets, the name of this one is slipping my mind big time right now, but not the full frontal nude scene she did! Hey, don't bash me, fellow female reviewers: she can act. I think she's a great actress, but the rest of the package is quite nice also. Onto the movie at hand ...<br /> You're going to think exactly this after the 1st hour of this movie: \\"This is going nowhere, it's slow, maybe I'll turn it off and watch one of the Lord of The Rings movies for the 100th time, I'd rather see Gollum.\\" DON'T DO IT! This movie is a fooler, and the last hour and 11 minutes builds up to an ending that will blow you away. <br /> Hard to say much more than that, or I'll give a lot of it away here. One actress which you will get to see a lot of, who plays Berlin in the movie, I hope to see in MANY more scenes like the one you'll be watching over and over, trying to figure out how Kevin Spacey gets paid for doint that! The greatest job on the earth.<br /> Seriously, this ending will leave you putting all the little pieces together long after the credits roll. If you love movies which make you really think afterwards, then get this one now. <br /> 4 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF DVD's, USA.
0789723107|5.0|I thought this book was not going to have much information because of its small size but, I bought it because the reviews from other readers convinced me.  Boy, am I glad that they did.  I opened this book at 10pm and did not put it down until I was too tired to stay up anymore (1 am) I had to get up for work the next day at 6:30am (I live far from work, that's why). If not for work, I would probably have read the whole book that night. <br />I bought this book because I was tasked in building an intranet at work.  I knew HTML and scripting but was not keen on usability. I wanted the intranet to be useful and to keep the users coming back for it's ease of use.  After reading a few chapters Steve Krug has taught me to look at my intranet development with a common sense view and not a technical view where I wanted to fill pages with features and clutter.  Most users want the information they are looking for right in front of them and not have to think and analyze the information.  Simplicity for them and ease of development for me, a win-win situation!  This is a small book with a gigantic message that will help you look through the eyes and thoughts of the user and will teach you how your sites will be used by them. This is a great book and it is a must have if you are developing internet/intranet sites.  Especially, if you are a newbee to web design like me.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Let me start off by saying that when it comes to scary movies I'm a big wussie.  So when Jeepers Creepers came out in theatres I didn't rush to see it.  About a year or so later they showed it on Showtime and I figured I was safe within the confines of my own home.  The boogie man couldn't get thru my two inch thick wooden door or cheap window glass pane (I know, I'm an idiot).  So I sat down and since there was nothing else on, I watched.    Let me continue by saying this movie was not scary.  The people that said this movie was the scariest thing they've seen in years either have to get out more or are bigger wussies then I am (and I am up there).  Now even though the movie was not scary it was still an ok movie that's good on a rainy day or when you've got an hour and a half to kill.  So sit back and read on while I tell you the story of the Creeper.    The movie starts out with two collage siblings Trish and Darry.  They decide to ride home together and on the way they play brother and sister games like who can read a vanity license plate first and calling each other names (basicly bugging each other, if you have a sibling like I do then you know what I mean).    While driving, they almost get run off the road by a big old farmers truck with a suped up egine, his license plate: BEATNGU.  The truck passes them and the kids contine down the road.  A few miles down they see the truck again.  This time it's parked next to an old church and this (looks like a) man is throwing a few things down a sewer pipe, things resembling dead bodies wraped in bloody sheets.    Now this is the part of the movie where you stand up from your chair, point your finger to the screen and yell \\"IDIOT\\".  Instead of going straight to the cops the kids decide to make a u-turn and head to the old church to see what is at the end of the sewer pipe.  Sister Trish holds brother Darry by the ankles to get a closer look in the pipe but when they both see rats they both freak out and Trish lets goof her brother and down he goes.    The pipe leads to the cellar of the church and Darry tells Trish to basicly wait on the side of the road till she see help while He finds a way out.  While he's down there Darry sees one of the wraped packages seen thrown down the pipe, when he opens it he is shocked to find a body with a homemade surgical cut running down the torso but the body is still alive.  He also finds hundreds of dead naked bodies stuck to the ceiling and walls like christmas decorations.    Darry finds a way back to his sister and they head to the nearest phone to call the police.  They stop at a diner and while there they get a call on the pay phone from a women who says she has seen everything that will happen and tries to warn them.  They don't believe her and they hang up.  The police then show up, the kids tells their story and the police give them an escort back to the station.  But on the way they run into a little trouble.    The Creeper (the bad guy in this flick) takes out the two cops and then begins to eat one of their heads (at least the tounge).  The kids don't believe what they're seeing and then drive off to find another phone.  They find an old lady with a bunch of cats (a vision from the pay phone lady) but before the are able to use her phone the Creeper takes her out.  The kids get back in the car and try to leave but the Creeper stands in the middle of the road blocking their way.  Then after running him over 4 or 5 times we see that the villian in this pic... has wings?    The two get to the police station, tell the cops what happened and then call their parents.  The lady that called them at the diner shows up and tries two warn them again that the Creeper is after one of them.  Then tells them the storry of our monster.  Every 23 years for 23 days it gets to eat all it wants.  And its favorite meal on the menu is people.  Just then the lights and the phones go out and the cops try to battle the monster but nothing works.    So whodoes the Creeper want?  Who lives and who dies (besides almost every body)?  Will you feel you've wasted an hour and a half of your life after this?  Maybe, maybe not.  The dead bodies look really fake and the CGI on the wings and the flying Creeper look bad, not terrible but bad.  But if you like movies that are supposed to be scary and aren't then I suggest you pick up this dvd (to rent or buy).  It's got alternate endings and some other good stuff, I might pick mine up tomorrow.  I gave the movie 4 stars even though it only deserves 3, 3 and a half tops but you can't give 3 and a half and 3 isn't enough.  But I did like part one enough to go out and see part two in theaters.
B0000AR8NK|3.0|OK, really, what are you all listening to? The best he's done in years? One of his all time best? What reality (sorry, couldn't resist) are you living in? I have this in the CD player as we speak, and we are talking totally average DB record here...yes, there's a couple of nice rockers; but this is a tour throwaway - a record to get everyone hyped up for what Bowie probably hopes will be his biggest grossing tour since the 1990 Sound & Vision excursion. <br />Having been a fan for 30 years now, I'm not one to compare current with previous output - but if you're looking for Bowie the experimentalist (i.e., Low, Heroes, Outside, Heathen), or Bowie the hard rocker (i.e., Aladdin Sane, Scary Monsters), you won't find it here. You'll find a nicely executed, pleasant enough pop record. Since there's not many of those around these days, I suppose that's good enough. I dare say the tracks from Reality will really come to life only when played live. Overall, though, I have to give this a rather blah 3 stars.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I am very dissapointed in this album.  To me it sounds as if a bunch of people were just jamming in a basement and making stuff up as they went along.  I can do that by myself any time I want. Where's the craftsmanship?  A Perfect Circle's first album was constructed very well.  It was a work of art.  This one seems rushed and uninspired.  Hardcore fans of Maynard will get something out of it but other than that there's not much to get excited about.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|So many bands fall into the sophmore slump. However, A Perfect Circle take the &quot;curse of the second record&quot; and kick it into oblivion!! This album isn't better than Mer De Noms, it's a perfect progression from it. The band seems tighter, some guitar sounds have become signature (listen to the guitar at the beginning of &quot;Crimes&quot;, then listen to &quot;Brena&quot; from the 1st one), and the vocals are just....listening to Maynard sing is like butter melting on a bagel...so smooth and absorbing...he really is probably the best singer in modern rock. Anyway, pick this album up, you won't regret it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I downloaded this album four days in advance because I could not wait any longer. Yet I still anticipated today, as I had for months. I went to a local store first thing in the morning. As I walked in with my A Perfect Circle t-shirt on, I heard something very familiar. An employee was listening to \\"Thirteenth Step\\" on a company computer. I snatched up a copy and held it up to him and yelled \\"Kick a**!\\". I wound up buying two copies of the album. It is quite an enjoyable experience buying an album the day it is released, knowing that it will be remembered by many for a very long time.<br />As for the music, it is definitely, definitely worth the money. From the repressed, narcissistic intensity of \\"The Package\\" to the utterly beautiful \\"The Noose,\\" to the airy, atmospheric sound of \\"Vanishing,\\" this album is truly a work of art. \\"The Noose\\" seems to be the one song that grabs everyone's attention at first. For that song alone, this album is a must-have. \\"A Stranger\\" is a wonderful, yet sad song that seems to bring surpressed thoughts to the surface. \\"You're a stranger, so what do I care? You vanish today, not the first time I hear. ... Shy away, shy away phantom ... I'm better off without you tearing my will down.\\" <BR>Even through the odd \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Lullaby,\\" this album keeps my attention. The vicious yet reassuring \\"Pet\\" is rockin' good time! \\"Gravity,\\" probably the most overlooked song, grows increasing intimate with each listen. <BR>This is not a follow-up to \\"Mer de Noms.\\" I have heard a couple others say that they were surprised and slightly disappointed upon first listen. Though after a few listens, they changed their tone completely and began to praise this album.<br />\\"Not to pull your halo down, around your neck and tug you off your cloud, but I'm more than just a little curious how you're planning to go about making your amends...to the dead.\\" - \\"The Noose\\"
B000001ESJ|4.0|Believe it or not, my 13 yr old son is on his drum kit listening to Xadadu on the headphones.  And I thought this stuff was only for old white haired guys like me (and the rest of you who are into this stuff).  Rock on - The CD is simply excellent.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD does it all for me. Have driven a groove right through their first release Mer de Noms and have been anxiously awaiting this new masterpiece. Actually got ahold of a legit release a couple of days early and have listened dozens of times around already.  It keeps coming alive. There's so much layered within the lyrics (my take on The Package, The Noose, Pet leads me to think of Bush,Jr.)yet so much more to discover. Beautifully driving then beautifully flowing guitar work.   Emotional, thoughtful, brilliant.  Brings tears of joy to my eyes. Congratulations APC.

0440224764|5.0|The Partner is the 2nd Grisham book I have read recently; the other being The Runaway Jury.  I felt The Partner was a better read and Grisham knew exactly how to leave you with a bunch of questions at the beginning of the book and slowly gave you all the answers as you progressed.<br />You have to admire the lead character Patrick as he outsmarts the legal system when things seem like there is no escape.  The book takes a few twists and turns and sometimes things are not exactly what they seem, which makes it all the more interesting.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone.
1400049628|5.0|This book is the product of an obviously creative and ingeniously original mind.  Every possible connection with zombies is analyzed with exhaustive and painstaking detail.  I was absolutely fascinated by the descriptions and in particular the uprisings in history section of the book.  The book is totally engrossing and really gets you in the author's frame of mind.  You can tell that this is something close to his heart or else he wouldn't have spent so much time on it.  I know zombies don't REALLY exist, but after reading this you won't be so sure anymore.  But as the book says, you better be prepared just in case they do, and this is the best way to get ready!  Buy it, read it, know it, live it!  Uh oh, they're coming!!
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's RUMOURS, which was deservedly the top-selling album of 1977 and winner of the Grammy for Album Of The Year, is an album whose songs are filled with tension and raw emotion beneath the smooth suface. As it was being recorded, the two couples in the band, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham and Christine and John McVie, as well as Mick Fleetwood's own marriage, were breaking up, but the band not only managed to work together in the studio without any martial-arts-type fisticuffs, but also make a classic album, something the Rolling Stones couldn't do ten years later with DIRTY WORK. Unlike the Stones' album, which was pure bile, RUMOURS has a lot of emotional heat AND got-to-get-on-with-your-life hope for the future, expressed in such songs as \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way.\\" The fact that it's rhythmically coherent enough to be good for dancing to, despite all the issues the members had with each other, and even themselves, is all the more remarkable.    The album's lyrics ring true for me as well on a personal level regarding my issues with certain ex-classmates. After graduating from high school in 1993, I started getting more into classic rock while they stayed hooked on punk, metal, and rap, which was made attending food-related reunions so uncomfortable that I began to consider those events just \\"empty calories\\"; in fact, when I was asked what I'd do to look good for the actresses from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, I replied, \\"I'll avoid all food-related reunions at my old school until my ex-classmates decide that the 70s mean as much to them musically as the 2000s\\", which shows how bad the rift was, with many of them siding with authority figures against me. I defended my statement as not \\"stalking behavior\\" by saying that my time at my old school wasn't only over, but was, in my mind, totally null and void, as my former classmates and I drifted further apart musically. Unlike Fleetwood Mac, we couldn't have civil interactions while we hated eachother. Needless to say, the issues between my former friends and myself still remain largely unresolved today, and probably always will, unlike the members of Fleetwood Mac, who eventually became friends again.    Overall, this reissue of RUMOURS is great, with the first disc being the original album plus the B-side \\"Silver Springs\\", whose keyboards sound like holiday bells, the second being a live show from the ensuing tour, and the last featuring demos, roughs, and out-takes. If you're buying RUMOURS, make it this version.
B00005N5S2|3.0|Gregory Peck does his customary stellar job in this very enjoyable movie about General Douglas MacArthur.  The film spans the time frame from the onset of World War II and the fall of the Phillipines (of which MacArthur was military commander) through the relief of General MacArthur in the midst of the Korean War.  The movie is notably true to history in all respects that I could determine, and deserves kudos for that.<br />In my opinion the film is flawed because it goes out of its way to portray MacArthur in an unfavorable light.  It ridicules his skillful use of public relations, and presents MacArthur as a demagogue and as a somewhat shallow, manipulative, and downright political General.  The troops' dislike of MacArthur is overplayed--other great generals were not always popular with their men, but the fact is that MacArthur and his strategy of bypassing Japanese strong points (&quot;island hopping&quot;) worked, and saved countless American and Allied lives.  While there is perhaps some truth to the notion that MacArthur was obsessed with his image to the American people, the fact is that the country needed heros in the dark days following Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt knew it and served up Patton and MacArthur, and MacArthur knew it too.  In the early days of American involvement in the war, guts and morale were about all the country had going for it.<br />The movie deserves praise for its portrayal of MacArthur's handling of the Korean War.  I don't recall ever seeing a more insightful or accurate dramatic portrayal of what happened in this underexamined war, and the movie gives MacArthur credit for his boldness and genius, and at the same time, in a fair and evenhanded way, the film explains why President Truman saw fit to relieve MacArthur.  This action was appropriate although unfortunate, and the film handles this episode fairly, in my opinion.<br />The movie &quot;Patton&quot; is probably the model for how a movie should portray the life story of a great American general.  compared against &quot;Patton&quot; this film does not measure up.  Nevertheless, this film is well worth seeing and owning despite its flaws.rican general.  compared against &quot;Patton&quot; this film does not measure up.

B00005JKED|5.0|I think it was a great movie and I really feel sorry for all of those who really think these types of things do not happen and these types of officers do not exist.  This may be an extreme day in the life of a corrupt cop, but days like this do happen and the events of the day are not uncommon.  In big cities this should come as no suprise.  This movie is very entertaining, and very close to real life.  I highly reccomend it if you can handle having your eyes opened.
B0000C8AUO|5.0|This album rocks big time. Instant new classics include the driving &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, &quot;Never Get Old&quot;, &quot;She'll Drive The Big Car&quot; and &quot;Fall Dog Bombs The Moon&quot;. Further proof of his ongoing relevance.  <br />People will never stop comparing a new Bowie release to previous stuff, fair enough... but I guarantee you this one's a stayer and stands strong on it's own feet.<br />Highly recommended.
B000001E2W|4.0|I wouldn't go as far as saying that this is a must-have CD by the great band, but there are some tracks on it that are outstanding.<br />The quality is certainly not the best for a live album (for a lesson in quality live recordings, look at Iron Maiden's Live after Death), but there is still some killer tracks here.<br />However, I am still wondering my Among the Living is not on here - in my opinion, this is one the best songs they ever did as a live set.<br />I love the live version of Bring the Noise with Public Enemy - these guys pioneered alot of the sounds that you hear now with bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, POD etc and you can hear that in this track - simply awesome.<br />The crowd/live atmosphere is not really transferred onto this recording, especially with those recorded in the studio with a &quot;live&quot; audience.<br />Still, this is an Anthrax album so that alone gives it some merit !!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|People who rated this album as a bad album didnt actually sit down and give it a good listen, if they actually did they would find what it was actually all about. Its a great album and as good or better than the first APC Cd
B000099T2L|2.0|From the moment I bought this album I was VERY dissapointed in it, I listend to the whole cd once and that was more then enough for me. Beyonce is an incredibly beautiful yet talented woman who can sing very well, yet the songs were BLAH. Their so boring and DULL &quot;Yes&quot; is the coolest track yet still boring,in BABY BOY you can tell her and Sean Paul have no chemistry. You want a good cd check out Monica After the Storm, its great, or even better a woman who can actually sing and hit every single note known to man and not known, Mariah Carey Charmbracelet. Peace
0312983867|4.0|The 8th book in the Stephanie Plum series is pretty much as good as the other 7.  It's another page turning, action-packed, well plotted, well written novel. Most of the usual beloved characters are here as well as a new one - attorney Kloughn (Clown) - who I'd like to see remain as a regular.  Stephanie's main task in this book is to find a missing woman and her daughter, as she is stalked by a relentless mobster. The problem I have with this book is that some of the situations are not believable.  The author does not give Stephanie a really good reason to keep seeking the woman after the mobster keeps trying to kill her.  The reader has to ask themselves, 'Why is she continuing with this??'  I think Ms. Evanovich went a little too far stretching our imaginations in this book in several situations, to the point where she brings us out of the novel back into reality, darn it.  On the other hand, things heat up between Stephanie and Ranger. That, and the general good read the book provides, as all of the &quot;Plum&quot; books thus far, makes this a must read.
0465011020|4.0|As a recent amateur student of North Korea, I have read several of the popular autobiographies by people who have escaped this ultra-restrictive nation.  &quot;Aquariums&quot; is an EXCELLENT book, reads easily and quickly, and conveys a considerable amount of background/history of the North Korean society.  The parallels between this bizarre society and that portrayed in Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; are SOOOO pronounced as to be almost scary; it's almost as if Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il used it as a roadmap.<br />This book should be required reading for every high school student.  In our modern American culture where our freedoms are not only taken for granted but not even recognized for their uniqueness in the world, I suspect most readers would think &quot;Aquariums&quot; to be a work of fiction rather than chilling modern day experience.<br />I encourage everyone to read this fine narrative.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|He's reached us with such willing grace.  Purity of intent.  Many of these songs have hardly existed.  I never heard them even when they were right there.  Not the moment, certainly.  Hank, of course.  Depeche Mode, guility but no less true. Trent, in fits and starts.  I'm sure Trent cried buckets of tears when he heard.  So did Nick Cave and all us oscillating beings who first died to &quot;13&quot;.  June saved him, so did his faith.  Faith in eternity, the light, a guilty man's salvation soaked in the saviours cascading stains of holy, sanguine love. <br />The specifics of this album are lost to me.  Who sang what, when, why.  The moments are what stab. The approximation to glory of Nick and John crooning faithfully; dusting off Hank's favourite suit, wiping the lipstick offa his collar to obscure his transgressions from the only woman who ever dared.  June.  Myra Hyndley.  Bonnie Parker.  The ghosts of dead sinners haunt these tracks like Ian Curtis floating through that graveyard in my head, chanting T.S. Eliot paens to faith and devotion.   The tracks in Nicks arms.  The stains of time.  The hurt, haunting, holding on to June's face until it too flickers out.  The fire.  Rings around Johnny and June, hotter 'an a pepper sprout.  <br />&quot;All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how&quot;, his best line.  All the fury of the longing.  Clinging sweetly.  I wish he would have covered Morrissey's &quot;I don't mind if you forget me&quot;.  Too obvious, perhaps, but scathing.  On his tongue, a kick against the pricks. L. Cohen's &quot;The Butcher&quot;.  Scott Walker's, &quot;It's raining today&quot;, Nico's &quot;The Line&quot;.  Tom Waits' &quot;Black Wings&quot;, Death in June's &quot;Fall apart&quot;.  <br />&quot;Surely some revelation is at hand; <BR>Surely the Second Coming is at hand. <BR>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out <BR>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi <BR>Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert <BR>A shape with lion body and the head of a man, <BR>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <BR>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it <BR>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. <BR>The darkness drops again; but now I know <BR>That twenty centuries of stony sleep <BR>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, <BR>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, <BR>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?&quot;--Yeats<br />In dreams, he singeth still...
B000001Y2U|5.0|It's sort of strange, because this album was essentially the beginning of Manson's career (he had a couple beforehand, but neither sold much until after the release of this one), but it's his true masterpiece.<br />Later albums have been excellent, but this album stands out because of two things.  Its a screaming monster of a concept album in its truest form, and it was a self fulfilling prophecy.<br />The 'story' of Antichrist Superstar is that of a child so abused by the Christian faith that he grows into their worst nightmare and leads a revolution of sorts as an antichrist.  With the release of the album, Manson shot to instant infamy and superstardom and began living out the story he'd written for the album.<br />That's all very interesting, but the real attraction of the album is the high polish on the music and lyrics.  The album is completely internally coherent - it does tell a story from start to finish.  The music (due in no small part to the input from Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails) is far more complex and expertly produced that later Manson efforts (especially the drums).  That said, the music is also a pretty pure example of modern industrial, filled with a lot of screaming and distorted guitar, so it obviously won't appeal to everyone.<br />Overall, this is actually one of the essential albums of the nineties, and certainly the best Manson has ever made.
B000092ZYX|3.0|The first sound on Hail to the Thief, the sound of a guitar being plugged into an amp, can't help but get a Radiohead fan like myself pumped up for what's to come--I took it to mean that Thom and the gang are plugging back in their guitars and they're going to rock our faces off Bends-style.  Don't get me wrong, Kid A was a phenomenal record, and Amnesiac had it's moments of transcendence (i.e. Pyramid Song, Life in a Glasshouse), but the thought of Radiohead tapping back into their roots while still progressing their music with electronics as well gave me chills.  And the opening song, 2 + 2 = 5, definitely delivers.  Meandering through an Amnesiac-style falsetto moaning over electronic drums and a mystical linear guitar progression, then exploding into a breakdown that rocks harder than anything Radiohead has yet recorded, the song is truly awesome.  Unfortunately, Hail to the Thief fails to provide 56 minutes of this brilliance.<br />The fact that the rest of the album isn't as rock-oriented as it's opener isn't really the problem here.  The main problem is that Radiohead seems content to mine their previous successes (shadows of the aforementioned Pyramid Song and Life in a Glasshouse can be found all over this CD) and provide some nice spooky atmosphere, rather than crafting truly great songs.  The shameless rehashing starts with the second track, which all but duplicates the opener, replacing the rockout with a blast of electronic drums and Thom Yorke moaning &quot;The Raindrops&quot; over and over.  A nice effect, but seeing as we just heard it about 2 minutes ago, it loses a bit of impact.  It's also the first of several songs on the album to try to recreate the mystical piano feel of Pyramid Song.  And this pretty much sums up the CD.  It's never terrible, but it's full of songs that never get beyond a cool atmosphere or a competent recreation of previous Radiohead moments.  It's a nice listen, but there's little depth (although it will probably succeed inmaking many listeners think that there is), and nothing new is really presented.<br />There are a few standout tracks.  Go to Sleep is another great song on level with 2 + 2 = 5;  A Punchup at a Wedding has a compelling funkiness to it; There There is solid and fresh-sounding; and A Wolf at the Door is an absolutely monumental, brilliant song.  Other than that, there isn't much of interest here, although some will find these songs worth buying the album for.  And of course, tons of people are going to love this CD because it's Radiohead, and a lot of kids who don't even know who Thom Yorke is are going to discover it and think it's the most incredible work of genius they've ever experienced.  If you're one of these kids, my advice to you is this: go buy/burn/borrow/steal OK Computer and Kid A and give them a few listens.  Hail to the Thief pales to the point of transparency in comparison.
0156027321|5.0|OK, I rated this book highly for a couple reasons:  This book is so unlike anything I usually read... is there another book out there that could be similar? And because it is a book that I will remember for a very long time.  Pi was a great character... so was Richard Parker! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. A wonderful tale!!  However, I will say that I need to think about it some more, or perhaps talk about it with someone else who read it... because I'm sure there are deeper associations made in this book that I didn't get...but it was a great read and gives one a lot to think about in the end,too!
B000002KNI|5.0|This recording captures not only some great music, but a true musical and cultural experience.  I know.  I was there.  I was 16 and one of a half million people in Central Park.  We arrived at noon and met some wonderful people of all ages from around the world.  It really was a fantastic experience, even if the concert never happend.  But it did, and it was the icing on the cake.  It was fantastic - everyone dancing and singing, and I will never forget the intensity and emotion of everybody dancing to Late in The Evening.  It was so good, S&amp;G played it again as an encore and the crowd went wild!  The only regret I have about this recording is that they did not include the second playing - it was very energetic.  If you are even the mildest of S&amp;G admirers, make this a part of your collection.  Hit play, play it from beginning to end, close your eyes and imagine yourself in Central Park on a cool evening.  You will not be disappointed.
0553277472|5.0|Just pick it up and enjoy it for what it is, not what one was told it is. Sure, some parts lack continuity, but this is a book to read at an enjoyable pace.  Don't expect to have a life changing experience, just consider it an opportunity to think with more open-mindedness.  It's a satisfying book which you won't soon forget.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album doesn't quite live up to the debut, Hybrid Theory, it is much better than Reanimation.  This is a good combination of rap/rock just like the first one.  Good combination like Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine.  This has some great tracks like Somewhere I Belong, Faint, and Don't Say.  Nobody's Listening is some of the beest rap/rock I've heard in a long time.  If you're an LP fan go buy this one.
0553573403|5.0|I LOVE this series! This is high fantasy at its best; full of intrigue, rich detials, realism and a plot that keeps you hooked. As one who never went in for &quot;high&quot; fantasy (the thought of Tolkein makes me shudder - ugh), I was suprised how quickly the first pages of this book grabbed me - I was hooked and stayed up half the night with it! I think it took me three days to read it cover to cover and I've been eagerly awaiting each installment ever since.<br />I've read all three books in the series and can find no faults with any of them!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|This is my favorite Godsmack album.  Their first one was really good, their second one didn't impresse me that much with only haveing a few good ones that stick on your head.  This album has great songs like Serenity, one of my favs, an acoustic song.  The melody is great.  Straight Out Of Line, another great one.  I Stand Along got my hooked again when I heard it on the Scorpian King Soundtrack.  This cd debuted at #1 and has well diserved it.

B000021YQV|5.0|Their first was good, but this is better.  SOAD really improved from their debut album.  Some of my favorites are Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, and Science.  Although slow Aerials and Atwa are also some of my favorites. This cd stole my ear drums from Prison Song all the way to Aerials.  Great melodies.  Still as heavy as their first...but better.

Simply fantastic.<br />I've read all three books in the series and can find no faults with any of them!
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd grabbed my by surprise.  When I heard Crawling I wasn't that impressed.  I decided to get it anyway and man was I glad!  This is a great debut.  Great lyrics, great guitar parts, great everything.  This cd also includes an instrumental.  It has a great melody.  While Mike Shinoda is rapping, Chester Bennington is doing a combination of screaming/singing, etc.  Their voices mix excellent. One of my favorite bands out now!

B00005JLKB|5.0|This series is great! It mixes in the storyline of Superman while developing the relationship between Lana Land and Clark Kent. Comedy, Action and Adventure all mixed in with Romance and Drama. As a friend once noted, Smallville is the \\"soap opera for men\\" which I laughed off and totally agree with.
B000003TAL|3.0|teenage riot is classic. the rest is not that great.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Anyone who calls CHICAGO the best musical of all time doesn't know much about musicals, but I'm glad they enjoyed it.<br />Reviewer Daniel Wahl seems to have missed the irony of the show entirely.  The amoral characters are not SUPPOSED to be sympathetic.  They're vicious and not-too-bright and what's amusing is watching them achieve their tacky dreams by attacking and double-crossing one another.<br />There are plenty of precedents for CHICAGO's tone: PAL JOEY, for one.  The Rodgers and Hart masterpiece concerns two characters just as venal as Roxie and Velma: a rich jaded adulteress and a vicious young gigolo.  PAL JOEY opened on Broadway in 1940.  What about CAROUSEL, where a rather stupid, innocent girl is seduced by a nasty two-bit hustler?  When you look at the variety of musical subjects done on Broadway over the decades, it's pretty silly to call CHICAGO a &quot;new kind of musical&quot;.<br />Even 1928's SHOWBOAT dealt with some harsh issues: racism, mixed marriages, gambling addiction, alcoholism.  The very first word sung in SHOWBOAT is &quot;the N word&quot; -- a shocking opening that is censored even today.  Hammerstein wanted to confront audiences with the evil of racism right off the bat.<br />The American musical stage has told all kinds of stories since then, some warmly sentimental, others -- like this one -- harshly cynical.<br />I was frankly surprised that CHICAGO was as successful as it was on the screen, since many people like Mr. Wahl feel musicals should always tell sweet, sentimental stories.<br />I love the &quot;warm&quot; musicals like SOUND OF MUSIC, but there is also a place for some with a harder edge.  CHICAGO is not better than THE SOUND OF MUSIC; it's just different.  And having different kinds of musicals, rather than the same kind over and over, is a good thing for the art form of the American musical.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Totally cool, frodo the ring gandalf. Goolum is also totally cool. Totally cool fight thing. This movie is totally cool. The second in the totally cool rings series. They continue the quest for the ring.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've been waiting desperately for a new album from A Perfect Circle - yesterday was a big day for me, the release.  I've listened already at least 9 times to the CD in it's entirety, but one song over and over again.  I love &quot;The Noose&quot; - wow.  It's just one of those songs that touches your soul.  I really love this album, it sounds much different than Mer de Noms, but then we have a whole new group of musicians working together.  I'm pleased by Jeordie working w/ Maynard; how moody can it get?  Simply wonderful!  Sometimes the music reminds me of old The Cure (track 4 &quot;Blue&quot;), really great to listen to.  There are distinct A Perfect Circle/Maynard sounds and influence, take track 8 &quot;Crimes&quot; for example - love it!  But this album tends to be more somber, darker and deeper than their last.  I'm glad to have all new music - who wants 2 identical albums?  I hate when musicians can't come up w/ anything different.  These are some very artistic, deep individuals.  I'm entirely impressed and will be addicted to this CD for a long time.  I consider Mer de Noms one of the greatest albums of all time.  I love Maynard with a deep respect.  This is a beautiful new work, not to be missed.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A Perfect Circle's second album is definitely worth your time.  It's well composed and performed, and takes you through a journey with waves of hard and soft music.  <br />&quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a great cover, but other harder songs like &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;Package&quot; will make you want to hit repeat even before you realize you're doing it.  In general, the album is a bit mellower than Mer de Noms, but it's still a nice compliment to the previous album.  It's not the same old material, but it's still A Perfect Circle. <br />Take the time to buy this cd - it's well worth it.
B00004YW6I|5.0|The CD is great.  You should also check out [...] for the fan/tour/documentary of her &quot;Stories&quot; tour.  It's a film entitled &quot;Stories From the Road&quot; and it's gotten good reviews too!  Check it out!!<br />[...]
B00003CXXM|4.0|i always hated how trailers and previews always schmaltzed up the movies and edited through the best parts. Why not just pick crucial points ad/or scenes from the movie, so that we get a good idea what it's about? When i saw the Previews and trailer for this one, i immediately thought that same thing was going on. But when we got it on video, and i watched it for the first time, i realized that it was as complex, thrilling, and action-packed as it looks. There is adrenaline and &quot;testosterone&quot; in this movie, but enough plot to make the action more satisfying, and give it a point. Two complaints, however. When Bourne fights the guy who later jumps out the window, towards the beginning, stabs him twice with a blue pen, and throws him over the table and he lands on the floor, why does he just get back up and fight like it never happened? this must have been for style points, and it was kind of cool, but considering the plausibility of the rest of the story, i expected something a little more realistic. Also when he jumps off the balcony near the end and shoots two guys as he falls down like 4 flights of stairs, and lands on the guy, stops for a second, catches his breath, and gets up, the same thing applies. But these things should be taken lightly as they are, and of course, it IS hollywood. Great movie, up there with the Jack Ryan movies. Hope i didn't give too much away, but i think i did.
B00009RGBS|4.0|The art of making any musical in the mainstream has been long lost, until now.  Chicago is a satire musical, satire meaning over-the-top, impossible, just hilarious stuff.  There is no doubt this movie has a dark side to it, but the music is so good and the actors pull everything off beautifully.<BR>  I have to say that &quot;Velma&quot;(Catherine Zeta Jones)really steals the show here, even more than Richard Gere does.  Aparently Catherine has been in theatre and done musicals before, it shows.  She has this incredible flow and energy out there, she would lite up a stage no doubt about it.  There was basically no weak link in this cast at all, they all suprised me.  Who knew that Renee Zwelleger, Richard Gere /Katherine Zeta could sing so well!!  They really suprised me in this movie.<BR>  The best aspect of the movie by far is the way the dream sequences and regular scenes are blended together so well, they flow right into one another.  People just do not bust out into song, you know it is coming and feels right at the time.  This method could have been butchered, sloppy and disaterious for the movie, but they pulled it off wonderfully.  The electricity that is required in a live musical is here and grabs your towards the screen, of course the short costumes help also.  <BR>  I liked the set designs, it had the look of the 20's and the feel of it.  The craziness of the times was there on screen and it added the finishing touch to the movie.<BR>  As I said before, this is a satire.  A satire basically pokes fun at a subject, the impossible and outlandish are required for it.  Try not too take the plot too seriously and just enjoy it.  There are actually truths to this plot, while they are exaggerated, they are still there.  <BR>  Overall a masterpiece of a musical, funny, well thought out and the music just makes the movie come alive.  Highly reccomended to anyone.
B00005JL78|4.0|some people i know didn't like this because it was too dark and gross. Well, the scene with the blindfold, and the milk and sandwich was pretty gross, and i agree that it was dark, but that adds to the mystery. Anywho, you really feel for the main character, played very well by Tom Cruise, and I was kind of surprised that he did drugs, but that's just part of the role. The end is very intense, you should watch this just for the part where the Pre-cog all of a sudden yells for Tom to run. It's intense. Great movie, what you'd expect from This top-notch director and excellent premise.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Overall, I was very entertained by this movie. Despite how long it was, I never felt myself getting bored. Granted, I wasn't looking for a history lesson like some of the chowderheads that have reviewed this movie. If you want a history lesson, why are you going to a Hollywood movie? Go to a library or watch the History Channel for Pete's sake!<br />I found the acting to be outstanding with one glaring exception: Cameron Diaz. Not since Coppola put his daughter in Godfather 3 have I been more amazed at such poor casting. This woman simply cannot act among the ranks of Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day Lewis (and I cannot see why some people actually think she is pretty). I guess she's alright in those Something About Mary roles that require nothing more than acting goofy, but for such a moving piece of cinema, I would have picked somebody more talented for that role.<br />I cannot recommend buying this movie based solely on Diaz. As much as I enjoyed the rest of the film I simply could not sit through it again to witness her failed attempt at acting. Definitey worth a rental though, and if Cameron Diaz doesn't completely ruin it for you, then you may find it worth buying.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Great album. Sold out a little, but music is still just as good so i don't care. Choppier, but that's because it's a culmination of all 6 of their previous full albums. Expanding their style. Unlike other hit machine bands such as Linkin Park, who churn out rehashes (and for that matter, remixes too), these guys progress with every album, trying out new styles and instruments, and for that reason, plus their arsenal of hits, they could be referred to as the Beatles of their day. (not as good though) Nice to hear john back weilding his axe, and on tracks such as around the world and easily, he shines. My favorite song is otherside. It sounds like a simple song but if you really listen to it, the lyrics, and how it develops, it's great. If you liked By the Way but don't have this one, or if you like their old 80s stuff, or if you like them at all, this is a good album to get. Maybe not as good as Blood Sugar, Milk, or Mofo (boy that sounded weird) but essential for any level of fan.
B00009V7T2|1.0|spend your money elsewhere, or if you must, buy RUSH, cuz that is what these guys sound like
B00006RU5B|4.0|but that doesn't mean it ain't good. The group really gels on heavy tracks like gasoline, one of the best songs of the year, and on slower but just as intense songs like i am the highway and like a stone. Fans of Rage will like cochise- I heard they wrote it after a Native American who went on a killing rampage, and that's really how intense it is. And fans of Soundgarden, or at least Chris Cornell, will enjoy light my way and the last remaining light. But not every song is good. Everyone seems to hate What You Are, and yes it is kind of boring, and the guitars are too loud, also hypnotise has a cool drumbeat but also gets old. Anyway, If you heard Rage and Soundgarden together and thought, Man, i gotta go get this album, Then you will ABSOLUTELY not be disappointed. A-
B00000427L|4.0|I love Vladimir Ashkenazy, his music always brings a romantic feeling to me. Most of the time it is fine in playing Russian composer's fieces. However, I think it is &quot;misplaced&quot; in Rachmaninov piano Concento #2, which supposes to display a dark side of the emotions, and the struggle of the mind. The first movement is slow, to me a little bit &quot;dull&quot;, it is like a zepher instead of a storm passing by. I prefer Van Cliburn's powerful and passionate play in this piece. But still I enjoy this CD very much, it is a nice plus to my selections.
B000002UDB|4.0|some good stuff, some of the beatles' best songs, which is saying a lot about the quality of this album. The trouble is, some of them don't mix well. that hardly matters, though, as it's worth getting for all you need is love, strawberry fields forever, blue jay way, flying, and penny lane.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've awaited new material from A Perfect Circle since the day their debut, \\"Mer de Noms\\" was released. I couldn't get enough of that album, and I can't get enough of this one. \\"Mer de Noms\\" was the best music I'd heard in years, and the combination of Maynard's vocals and Billy's guitar playing is what made the album the most. This time around, Maynard and Billy have taken a step back so that the other members could make their parts a bigger piece of the circle. The album's first single, \\"Weak And Powerless\\", didn't particuarlly blow me away when I first heard it, because it sounded like what I heard in the past, but when this song is heard cranked on your CD player and not on the radio, it sounds leaps and bounds better. The opening track, \\"The Package\\", is a beautiful slow melody. Just by listening to the first 3 tracks on this CD, you'll notice some remarkable similarities to The Cure's \\"Disintegration\\". Another song, \\"The Outsider\\", likely to be the next single, is one of 2 heavier tracks on the album, and is one of my favorites. The other heavier song, is \\"Pet\\". If you were to compare this album with the last, you shouldn't expect to hear anything along the lines of \\"Judith\\" \\"Thinking Of You\\" \\"The Hollow\\" or even \\"Magdalena\\". The album is much closer to \\"Orestes\\" \\"Rose\\" or \\"3 Libras\\". The album isn't very heavy or rocking, it's a delicate emotional album. But if you loved \\"Mer de Noms\\", then I'm sure you'll love this one as well. The 5 sound clips that Amazon will post on here is not worthy sampling, this is an album that must be put into your stereo and played all the way through at high volume. My favorite tracks are 1,3,5,7,9,10. I don't know where these guys come up with such brilliant music, but I hope they keep it up for as long as possible. I'm sorry, but these guys are artists in the truist form, and though they aren't part of pop culture, they are one of the best bands to come out in years.
B000002U82|5.0|everyone likes this album. I don't care about their other albums. This isn't good study or background music, but if you sit down and listen to it and stop what you're doing, you notice more complexity and interesting electronics that were probably ahead of their time. During this period, the early 70s, SO MANY excellent albums came out, not just this one, but you will like this no matter what. I think. Unless you don't. whatever.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've had this cd on reserve since i saw APC in concert AUG 1st .. so this has been a MUCH anticipated album for me! I didnt quite know what to expect with this album i was hoping it to be like Mer de Noms... but its not its so much more heartfelt it feels like maynard is in the room with you singing his f****** heart out!!! i was so blown away by this album!!!! My favorite tracks are Noose,Blue,and Pet ... the first time i heard Noose the feeling i got was amazing!!! I suggest that EVERYONE who has an appreciation for music and the passion that these guys have expressed to go get this cd!! and find out for yourself how the &quot;thirteenth step&quot; touches you!!!!!!
B000002JSJ|4.0|This is one of Led Zeppelin's less-known albums, receiving very little praise from the general public.  However, most hardcore fans are sure to realize that this album was their last decent effort at rock music.  The opening track, &quot;Achilles' Last Stand&quot; is alone worth the price of the album, sprawling 10 minutes in all its musical glory and complexity.  Layers of crashing guitars, passionate lyrics, and some of Bonham's most rapid and seismic drumming thus far.  Seriously, this gives most other Led Zeppelin epics a run for their money, and along with Kashmir, Dazed and Confused, and Stairway to Heaven is arguably one of their absolute greatest songs.  That side, the album is still quite enjoyable.  Sure, it's not Physical Graffiti, but most of the tracks aren't bad, and a few others such as &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; are actually very good.  It's tracks like this that prove Led Zeppelin had more Physical Graffiti in them, even after the album was released.  Contrary to most listeners' beliefs, this was not a bad Led Zeppelin album, and though it may be largely mediocre compared to the rest of their records, &quot;Achilles' Last Stand&quot; is simply too great of a song not to purchase.
B000002L68|5.0|This is an album I can listen to today and still enjoy as much as when I was in high school.  Prince is at his best here, with songs that tell a story while portraying a wide variety of moods and emotions.  \\"When the Doves Cry,\\" the best song on the album, is soulful and poignant.  Prince is extremely energetic on both \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" and \\"Baby I'm a Star,\\" and more playful on my second-favorite tune, \\"I Would Die 4 U.\\"  \\"Darling Nikki\\" exudes sexuality, while \\"Purple Rain\\" is sad and sweet.  Few other artists can pack as much feeling into a single album; this one is a must-have.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|Can you put any more sound effects on a CD? I thought Janet Jackson was queen of this, but no more. Worldwide Underground loses touch with the essence of what makes Erykah Badu a truly unique talent. Even the voice I love becomes just plain noise after a while. I've listened to this CD quite a few times, and the majority of songs are overproduced with a mess of sound effects that fails to push her forward. Just because this album is different from previous efforts does not mean it's &quot;revolutionary.&quot; Give me Mama's Gun any day over this.
0316666343|5.0|My introduction to the writings of Alice Sebold was through her memoir &quot;Lucky.&quot; The two are actually incomparable- one is a memoir, the other is a novel. The only similarity between the two is the presence of a violent rape scene in both. &quot;Lucky&quot; is based on the effect this has on the victim; &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; holds the rape as a part of a larger incidence of violence- murder. The novel chronicles Susie's reaction not just to the rape, but also (and more importantly) to having her physical life extinguished at the young age of 14. In &quot;Lucky&quot; the victim mourns the loss of her innocence; in &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; the victim mourns the loss of her life. While the former is filled with an almost journalistic account of the effects of physical violence, the latter is filled with emotion and sorrow after such an event.  <br />Susie could be any of us, our children, our friends, our classmates, anybody. I think that no matter who we are, we are intrigued by the thought of what happens to the soul (or spirit or whatever you want to call it) after death; this novel offers a fresh perspective. I am really at a loss how to describe my feelings, thoughts and reaction to this novel. My brother killed himself at a relatively young age so reading this was like reading what might have happened to him after the physical body died. This was a vivid portrayal of such potentials, but it also accurately depicted the various stages of grief gone through by the family. Every member of Susie's family was filled with life and emotion. Even if you have never had to deal with such a tragedy, you will be forced to experience the emotional trauma through the lives of these characters.
B00000IQW0|5.0|I feel like a young teen again waiting for BG (movie and the tv series) to be released on DVD.....EXACTLY how I felt waiting for each upcoming tv series episode when it first aired......laying on belly on floor with pillow wearing pajamas, 12 inches from tv screen looking up at console tv, without even blinking, with mixed emotions inside hoping the humans would escape cylon attacks, and surprise attack the cylons back!!!<br />Without a doubt, I was captivated most by the shiny silver bodied radar-echo sounding cylons with a single red-eye shifting back and forth horizontally, their voice with robotic-like sound and manners and a touch of automated human-like passion to complete the task at hand....destroy mankind.<br />Seeing the cylon weaknesses and strengths was for me separate excitement from the surrounding drama.  I always wondered if in the upcoming episodes the humans would find earth while the red-eyed cylons chased them to earth ......where a major battle would occur.  The endless possibilities (in my imagination) of what was to come in the upcoming episodes were some of the most exciting times of my teenhood.   One of the greatest sci-fi tv series I ever saw as a teen, and feel the same way about BG now.  The series and movie is timeless and ICON 70's sci-fi FOREVER!!!<br />....&quot;By Your Command&quot;......I am ready to purchase and re-live very memorable Battlestar Gallactica moments, and confident that others who will see it for first time will enjoy it too.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|It's definitely worth the money.<br />But the soundtrack, LIKE THE MOVIE, is too short. They could've included the material from the (lengthy) end credits and not hurt the CD at all, though it would've been repetitive,  because . . .<br />Maybe I'm wrong, but to my ear, there is only one melody on this entire soundtrack. Amazing!<br />It's slowed down and speeded up; the instrumentation varies; the meter changes from a dance (A fantastic proportion of the music is in WALTZ rhythm! for an action-adventure movie! go figure.) to a march; it might be \\"inverted\\" sometimes - plus there are a couple of bridges, a cello riff thrown in here and there - but it all comes back to the same tune.<br />In the business world, we would say the composer/arranger \\"re-purposed his content\\" - that is, used a limited amount of material in multiple ways. It does give a cohesiveness to the score.<br />But I wish they had included the words to the pirate song.<br />Another review says the music begins with a Celtic flavor - I would say that it ALL sounds somewhat Irish. It reminds me partly of heroic soundtracks by John Williams, but also partly of Christopher Franke's soundtrack for Babylon 5.<br />Did anybody else notice that some of the tracks' titles do not correspond to the parts of the movie where the music plays? The music for the wonderful scene when Capt. Jack sails into Port Royal at the start of the movie is inexplicably titled, \\"The Medallion Calls.\\"<br />If you play this in the car, use your cruise control! Otherwise, you'll surely get pulled over for speeding.<br />As for a movie review, I can't do better than the one here on Amazon from Sept. 2 titled, \\"Johnny Depp for Emperor.\\" Page down for the pleasure of reading it - if this man isn't a writer by trade, he should be.<br />And enjoy the CD!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is still the best work I have seen from the BBC.  Every character is played exactly right.  Some of the minor characters add so much to the film.  Two of my favorites are Mr. Collins and Lady Katherine.  I have watched this many times and recorded it, but always wanted it on DVD.  The lighting on some of the scenes is inferior to the version played on the A&amp;E channel.  But, if you are as much a fan of Pride and Prejudice as I, you will still be glad to have it on DVD.  There are some small additions to the original.  And a little bit of behind the scenes footage.  I highly recommend the DVD set.
B000002LKF|5.0|Paul Simon followed up the classic Graceland, his fusion of African and Western pop music with this stunning album of great songs with a South American and more particularly Brazilian flavour.<br />The Obvious Child is my favorite, a powerful melodic song with great drums and guitars and a wistful, nostalgic feel. Another favorite is The Coast, a story about a family of musicians taking shelter in a church; this song really impresses with its flowing melody, polyrhythmic drum patterns and moving lyrics.<br />Proof is another charming pop song, particularly noted for its evocative backing vocals and gentle, lilting rhythm whilst Further To Fly and She Moves On are more subdued, melancholy numbers with bubbling and insistent rhythmic patterns.<br />The mood lifts with the uptempo and buoyant Born At The Right Time, once again a lyrical and musical masterpiece and filled with catchy hooks. The guitar and atmospheric backing voices of Spirit Voices are beyond compare and the title track is a meandering piece with innovative instrumental flourishes.<br />What makes these songs particularly moving is that Simon tells the stories of ordinary people and that his perceptive, poetic lyrics are carried so well on the exotic instrumentation. Of course, the beautiful tunes have a lot to do with that. Rhythm Of The Saints may not be as immediately appealing as Graceland and may not offer quite as many classics, but it remains a major achievement, a brilliant marriage of Brazilian and Western popular musical styles.
0316666343|4.0|From the first page I was intrigued by this book. It is so sad, her pain does'nt end when she dies. I don't remember crying through any other book as much as I did with  this one.This book will stick in my mind for quite some time. Anyone else really enjoy this book ?
0375414053|3.0|it isnt nobel prize material but its a good read. <BR>a nice distraction  that isnt too taxing on the mind.<BR> amusing and fun to read .<BR>would make a good beach book!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Three years ago Iron Maiden released comeback album with Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith. It was massive success all over the world and showed that Maiden can still make good music. Now it's finally time for new studio album called Dance Of Death. Dance Of Death has been a massive success all over the world. Iron Maiden is back on top again!<br />Dance of Death is about war and death. It contains great songs about first world war and so on...<br />1. Wildest Dreams (Smith/Harris) is first single from new Iron Maiden album called Dance Of Death. It's short dynamic rocker from Mr. Smith. Wildest Dreams has became band's live favourite and climbing up on charts. Maybe you have heard song from radio, seen it on tv or heard on the recent 'Give Me Ed... Til I'm Dead' tour? <br />2. Rainmaker (Murray/Harris/Dickinson) is next single from Dance Of Death. It's again catchy rocker and the chorus is instantly memorable. Instant hit! 'You tell me we can start the rain...'<br />3. No More Lies (Harris) is first long epic song from the album. It's mix between The Clansman (from Virtual XI album) and Don't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger (from Virtual XI album). The '3 Amigos' make exellent solo work. <br />4. Montsegur (Gers/Harris/Dickinson) is very heavy song and it reminds a lot of Powerslave and Piece Of Mind. Starting riff is mix between Fallen Angel (from Brave New World album) and Losfer Words (from Poverslave album).<br />5. Dance Of Death (Gers/Harris) is second long epic song feturing very powerful lyrics and great Russian vibe with symphonic elements.  <br />6. Gates Of Tomorrow (Gers/Harris/Dickinson) is short rocker. Starting riff is like AC/DC meets Skunkworks (Bruce Dickinson solo album). Song itself features very catchy double guitar melodies.<br />7. New Frontier (McBrain/Smith/Dickinson) took only about 20 years until we could hear song from Nicko McBrain. Song reminds a lot of Maiden's early days like The Number Of The Beast or Piece Of Mind albums. New Frontier includes blistering solo from Adrian Smith.<br />8. Paschendale (Smith/Harris) is third and last long epic song on the album. Inspiration of song comes from historic battle, this one from the First World War. Paschendale is huge epic song which meets Pink Floyd, Emerson &amp; Lake &amp; Palmer and so on... One of the most memorable epics what Iron Maiden have ever done! Including incredible solo works from '3 Amigos' and amazing Bruce Dickinson vocal performance. 'Blood is falling like the rain...'<br />9. Face In The Sand (Smith/Harris/Dickinson) is very enigmatic and atmospheric song. It's a very slow grower, but soon you find singing with the melody.<br />10. Age Of Innocence (Murray/Harris) starts with Murray's slow melodic solo and then grows into quite fast song.  <br />11. Journeyman (Smith/Harris/Dickinson) is beautiful acoustic end featuring acoustic guitars, drums and strings.<br />Dance Of Death is album like... It's like... You don't hear these kind of albums so often anymore. It's made for those people who like great tales, long heavy epics and great melodies. Dance Of Death is album, that you could listen hours and hours again finding new elements. So find quiet place, take your headphones, close your eyes and enjoy. It will be memorable experience and you want do it again and again...
B00006ZCFH|3.0|Of course she's a great singer, of course she can get the best features and yes this album sounds great. But where is this album better than the last ones. Sorry, I just can't tell. She sounds a lot like she did on Commons album. Her vocals don't come out as strong as on Mama's Gun, her music not as strong as on the live-album. Miss Badu lacks creativiteit and deepness on the overall. She used to be a heart-moving soul-singer. But then maybee my expectations where to high. She has all the handles you could wish for but doesn't seem to be able to put it all to magic.<BR>Would i recommend this album ? Yes, i do. But it just isn't the biggest album this year. Let's see what Me'shell is gonna do next month ...
B0000033P0|5.0|1971's &quot;Tarkus&quot; is one of ELP's best works (though it's not really the &quot;concept&quot; album that some fans think it is). The title epic is a barnburning ELP classic, featuring some of Keith Emerson's best keyboard work ever, a thunderous bassline and strong guitar riffs &amp; vocals from Greg Lake, and big booming drums from Carl Palmer. As for the second half of the album, there's the piano rag fun of &quot;Jeremy Bender,&quot; the rollicking &quot;Bitches Crystal,&quot; the striking hymn of &quot;The Only Way,&quot; including it's awesome instrumental conclusion called &quot;Infinite Space&quot; (featuring excellent piano-banging from Emerson), the rocking &quot;A Time And Place,&quot; and finally, the band's humorous salute to their producer Eddy Offord, &quot;Are You Ready Eddy?,&quot; a 50's rock 'n' roll-style number. &quot;Tarkus&quot; is a great ELP disc.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The CD is more mello then Mer De Noms but still has the sound that APC wants and they put soo much strength into their lyrics and voices! GREAT CD!!!!!!
038572179X|5.0|This book is greater than the sum of its parts.  You will be extremely rewarded for the time spent with each of these characters.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|great album, very beautiful and i enjoy the mixing. im too lazy to write a big review so thats that, but go buy it.
B00005JKZT|5.0|We all walked out of \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" thinking, \\"How can this get any better?\\"  Well, folks, I'm here to tell you that it can.  \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" has greatly surpassed all expectations and defied any doubts that I ever had about this film.  Simply put: this is the best film of the year and was unjustly robbed of the Best Picture Oscar.<br />Fans of the first film definitely had their doubts.  And who could blame them?  We've suffered through a countless number of rotten and disappointing sequels within the past few years (ahem: Star Wars, Jurassic Park 3...).  Audiences worldwide were overjoyed at what they got.<br />\\"Two Towers\\", thankfully, picks up immediately where \\"The Fellowship\\" left off.  The Fellowship is broken.  Sauron's forces begin to amplify and his allies grow. Saruman's immense army mass towards the City of Gondor where Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are desparately trying to defend the people of Rohan who have taken refuge there.  The Ringwraiths are on the prowl.  Merry and Pippin are captives of the Uruk Hai.  Yet not all hope is lost.  The little hobbits, Frodo, the ring bearer, and Sam, a more faithful friend you could not find, press on towards Mordor with the help of Gollum, a pitiful creature consumed by his lust for the Ring's power.<br />As with \\"The Fellowship\\", \\"Two Towers\\" is alive with (get ready for a long list, here) a wonderfully faithful-to-the-book script, stunning landscapes, emotion, rousing action, a stirring score, excitement, suspense, fine acting, comradery, passion, humility, philosophy, intrigue, depth, symbolism, virtue, and stunning cinematography (whew, did I miss anything?).   <br />Bottom line: 5 out of 5 stars.  I love this film and you will too!
B00009MGQL|5.0|Contrary to previous reviews I think this may be Jeff's best album yet. The groves are intense (very Prince like) and the guitar licks show why Jeff is the standard by which all others are judged. It's great to know that there are still artists who don't rest on thier previous work. Jeff Beck is always pushing the envelope.<br />The hair on the back of my neck is still standing up. WOW!!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes are by far my favourite band. Everyone was expecting great things with ELEPHANT and in my opinion it did not dissapoint. It was everything I thought it would be and more! I really enjoy there style of music and Jacks voice. He plays the guitar like no other and Meg is amazing on her drums. I really can't wait untill The white Stripes give us another masterpeice of an album!
B000002GGU|5.0|I have like Bryan Adams since I was a little girl.  This is such a great CD by him.  It has all of his great hits, even though all of them might not of been #1.
B00003CXBK|5.0|There are no words that can describe how great Princess Mononoke is. Myazaki reall out did himself in this movie. This mobie is the best anime movie there is. It has action, drama, spirit, and adventure all in one. I can't totally describe how good it is but when it was over Impracticall died cause i wanted it to go on forever. It blew me away. It's just...Amazing.
B000002UAO|4.0|This U.K. edition of Rubber Soul contains two more songs than its U.S. counterpart, but the track that's missing is what makes all the difference.  I'm referring to 'It's Only Love', probably the finest song John Lennon ever wrote (with the Himalayan exception of 'A Day In the Life'.)  (For all you fellow-ancients out there, that was the first song on the second side of the old Capitol LP.)  If at all possible, go with the U.S. version; they're hard to find, but they're out there.  If that proves daunting, go with this version, but pick up the U.K version of HELP...you'll find 'It's Only Love' there (something I still haven't figured out.)
B00005JLWN|5.0|When \\"Equilibrium\\" came to theaters on a limited release status on December of last year, I knew that I had to see it, but I never had the time, and it was gone before I even had a chance to see it. Now, fast forward to May 13, 2003. \\"Equilibrium\\" was released on DVD that day. I went out and bought it and when I got back home, I put the movie in my DVD player, and I sat back and watched what was to be expected in this film, and man, I was not disappointed at all! \\"Equilibrium\\" is, hands down, the best sci-fi action thriller ever made (even if it was on a limited budget) since \\"The Matrix\\" back in 1999! The direction by Kurt Wimmer (writer for \\"The Recruit\\") was top-notch and unforgettable! The performances by Christian Bale (\\"Reign of Fire\\"), Taye Diggs (\\"Basic\\"), Emily Watson (\\"Red Dragon\\"), Angus MacFadyen (\\"Warriors of Virtue\\"), Sean Pertwee (\\"Soldier\\"), William Fichtner (\\"Black Hawk Down\\"), and Sean Bean (\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\") were outstanding and flawless!<br />\\"Equilibrium\\" takes place in a future which has gone through a third World War. When the war happened, people from all around the world joined together to create Libria, a society that outlawed emotions, simply because emotions are what caused the war in the first place, and that they have let emotion and feeling control them for way too long. In order for people to not experience any emotions whatsoever, they take a day-in, day-out daily dose of an emotion-altering drug called Prozium. Anyone who triggers an emotion within themselves (they are called \\"sense offenders\\"), had to be confronted with extreme prejudice. In order to keep the peace in Libria, these sense offenders are monitored and eradicated by a special breed of law enforcement called the Tetragrammaton Clerics. The main character of the film is John Preston (Bale), the nation's highest-ranking Cleric whose sole purpose is to seek out and destroy all those who refuse to submit to the will of Libria. Preston is the prodigal child of Libria's system of unfeeling. Since childhood, he has been trained in the ways of the gun-martial arts that has made him a tool of destruction. Where he goes, death is never far behind. During the film, Preston finds out that his own partner, Partridge (Bean), has been secretly reading books which, on the other hand, triggered an emotion inside of him. So, Preston dealt with Partridge with the only way of justice for Libria...death. After Partridge's death, Preston is assigned a new partner named Brandt (Diggs), a fellow Cleric who is looking to make a career for himself with Preston, etc. During the film, Preston becomes intrigued of both his way of life and of his victims (not to mention that his own wife was a sense offender). So, one day, Preston decides to skip one of his daily Prozium doses and he begins to see clearly that all is not right with the world as it is, especially when he falls for a fellow sense offender named Mary O'Brien (Watson). Before anyone realized that Preston was \\"off the interval\\" (stopped taking his drugs and could feel again), he was chosen for a mission of total importance, to seek out and destroy a movement called the Underground, led by its leader, Jurgen (Fichtner), which is the only organized opposition to the State rule. When they are destroyed, Libria will finally be victorious. But what happens next is a personal struggle that will make us all think a little on what makes us human. As the story goes, the audience is witness to a spectacular form of martial arts called \\"Gun-Kata\\" that is as entertaining as it is violent, and you'll see what I mean when you watch this movie!<br />The DVD of \\"Equilibrium\\" features two commentaries, one by director Kurt Wimmer and the other by Wimmer and producer Lucas Foster, as well as \\"Finding Equilibrium\\", a behind-the-scenes documentary, and some sneak peek trailers. In conclusion, \\"Equilibrium\\" is a DVD must-have for your action collection. If you did not have a chance tosee \\"Equilibrium\\" in theaters, then you must pick up this killer DVD, it will blow you away! I haven't liked an action film this much since \\"The Matrix\\", and with \\"Equilibrium\\"'s powerful storyline and high-energy action, it will keep you entertained from start to finish! If you love action, suspense, Matrix-like special effects, or just an all-out, rockin' good time, then look no further than \\"Equilibrium\\"!!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|As soon as I found time today (the day the cd came out), I went on down to the nearest Target and picked up the latest album from one of the most innovative and interesting rock bands to listen to today, A Perfect Circle. After giving this a thorough listen (in my car, for some reason the whole surround sound thing makes a better first impression), I had mixed emotions. My first thought was, &quot;wow, this is different than their first one&quot;. Then, I realized that it was perfect that it was different. I enjoyed the catchy, melodic sounds of Mer de Noms, and I sort of expected this album to sound similar. Thankfully I was wrong. APC has given its fans something new to think about and digest musically, and I know this will be in my music collection for years to come. While it doesn't blend together as well as their debut (in my opinion of course), this is still very much recommended. Experimental and better than any of the rock music put out today by far.<br />Favorite track: Blue<br />Least favorite: Lullabye (it's not really a song, more of a spacy intro to the final song, Gravity. Cmon guys, you could have given us a real song here!!)
0679882820|5.0|My 17 month old loves this book! Her grandfather even taught her to make the popping noise like Mr. Brown. It is so precious. A must have in your little ones library.
0790731002|4.0|This third movie had a completely different feel than the first two movies.  Tim Burton used mostly shades of grey to give Gotham and dark, creepy feel to it (as is typical of his style).  On top of that, his constant partner Danny Elfman's soundtrack completed the atmosphere.  This movie was a prelude to Batman & Robin, with all of its bright colors and a scope that is way too broad to be taken very seriously.  The first two movies are obviously better, but Burton stayed on-board as a producer, so it wasn't as bad as the later movies in the series.  As far as acting goes, Val Kilmer is believable, but Michael Keaton is better.  With Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell, and Michael Gough returning as Alfred, it has a very good cast going for it.  Add to that small roles from Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar.  Anyway, here we have the lost link between the great early movies, and the horrible later movie.<br />Side Note:  Notice Jim Carrey swinging that staff all over the place.  Now watch Cable Guy's Medieval Times scene with that big axe thing.  Looks like he learned a new skill after Batman Forever.  Dumb note, but whatever.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's new album American life is her most personal to date. Its not the usual dance inspired album you come to expect from the most successful female artist in rock history, its more folk/rock than Madonna. The album speaks from the heart. I expecially loved Nothing Fails and Xstatic Process. Two gyms on the album. Don't be fooled by any negitive comments by people who most likly have never even listened to the album. Read People mags reveiw or USA Today etc, all recommend this work. Madonna always changes and always seems to be ahead of the times and American Life is no exception.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|For the people who remember horror productions like &quot;the X factor&quot; or &quot;Virtual X&quot; must be a pleasure to know that Iron Maiden offers us not just another production but the very best in their last years, the return of Bruce is starting to show, you will provably remember songs of power slave or seven son of a 7th son or maybe no prayer for the dying, what means that the good days are back. These people don't seem to slow down, what its good for us Maiden to the bone.<BR>UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This is a must have cd in your cd collection!  I loved every song on the cd!!!
B00005JLT5|1.0|Roman Polanski, the exiled [physical] offender now hiding in Europe from the U.S. authorities, was given a best director oscar for this largely [imitation] work portraying *Jewish oppression* in Easern Eurpoe during WWII.  The Academy Award was merely a political statement by the leftist Hollywood elite who apparently believe that *artists* such as Polanski are way above the law.  \\"The Pianist\\" steals from \\"The Holocaust\\",<BR>\\"Schindler's List\\", and a host of other Jewish propaganda movies, ...  The main character, a ... piano player, spends most of the movie running from the SS, getting sick, and hiding like a rat, while he loses his parents, brother, and sisters to the concentration camps.  Any red-blooded American in that situation would have grabbed a gun and fought to the death to save his family.  The Pianist eventually *wins* his freedom courtesy of real men of the Red Army. ...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I just bought the cd today when it came out. I don't find it useful to compare it to Mer de Noms really because they are different and both equally great in their own respects. Though the band line up has changed the music does not lack. Something new is added. I like every song on the album, a great listen. Go buy it now !!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle somehow manages to reach emotional depths on this CD that Mer De Noms only touched on. This is the soulful album, Mer De Noms was the pretty one. Stunning from the first song, this CD delivers a powerful performance one would expect from some of the most brilliant musicians alive. My first listen touched my soul, gave me goosebumps, and left me in awe of the kind of feeling they can evoke with such beautiful sounds.<br />&quot;The Noose&quot; is my favorite song off the cd, and probably one of the most powerful, emotionally.<br />&quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is another of my favorites, as it's by far the strangest song I've ever heard APC come out with, and yet, it fits the CD perfectly. Perhaps because it wasn't composed by Maynard, it has a different feel, but the sound and the spirit remain the same.<br />&quot;The Outsider&quot; is another very powerful song, another of my favorites.. <br />Bottom line, my words can't begin to describe this CD. Get it for yourself, listen, and be AMAZED at what they're capable of.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Like NIN's Closer blatantly makes you feel &quot;naughty&quot;, Thirteenth Step does so subtly.<br />Thirteenth Step comes out much stronger and more confident than Mer de Noms. Whereas MdN made a situation/time/feeling bigger and better, TS plain-old MAKES a situation. It isn't just saying something, it's telling you something. Billy and Maynard are what I consider highly evolved. Together, they have cracked the code.<br />Is it magic? Nah. Really now. But it is eerie how APC has managed to melt all their instruments and vocals together like it was meant to be. Like it was in the stars: big-bang, dinosaurs, wars, some pyramids, some more wars, A Perfect Circle, etc.<br />This is music that will wake you up and remind you of your five senses. So leave yourself alone for 50 minutes, lie in bed naked with a fresh bottle of wine and JUST LISTEN. <br />You might feel something.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is probably the best album ive bought since Mer de Noms.  This album is also more mature than the bands first album.  If your favorite song from Mer De Noms was Orestes, Rose, or 3 Libras, this album is a must have.  Clearly, this CD has a high replay value, there are no songs that sound like any other one they have written before.  This new sound from APC is a delight to any fan of the band. Some of the most powerful and gripping tracks are &quot;The Noose&quot;,&quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;The Package&quot;
B0000BYM3K|5.0|- Wildest Dreams<BR>Great rocking opener from Adrian about his dream of ASAP headlining Donnington, with Maiden in support.<br />- Rainmaker<BR>A John Grisham novel at last gets the Maiden treatment. Blistering solos from Janick and Dave bring the tale of the underdogs vs a big evil corporate law firm vividly to life.<br />- No More Lies<BR>Very reminiscent of those old Spectrum Computer programs:<BR>10 Print \\"No More Lies\\";<BR>20 Goto 10;<br />- Montsegur<BR>Probably a song about the Catholic church. Perhaps a priest 'touched' Steve Harris a few years back, now we have that priest to thank for this the heaviest song on the album.<br />Dance Of Death<BR>- The band somehow combine Spinal Tap and Michael 'Riverdance' Flatley to produce this chilling epic set in the Florida Everglades. If you don't air-guitar to this song then you have you hands bound behind your back in Guantanamo Bay and are being played this song as part of a CIA sleep deprivation 'PsyOp'.<br />- Gates Of Tomorrow<BR>Dickinson penned song about that Star Trek episode where Kirk and Spock arrive at a distant planet where they find a portal back to past time. They go back to 1930s New York to allow the shows producers to save money by filming on the studios backlot.<br />- New Front Ear<BR>Topical song about genetically modified organisms, penned by Nicko McBrain. Nicko has a history of working in this field anyone who has seen his TV work with brightly coloured miniature bears will know what this song is driving at.<br />- Paschendale<br />Filler. I usually hit skip straight away.<br />- Face In The Sand<BR>A song about the boys love of Japanese Bukakke. Too much time spent watching videos on the tour bus I think, but nevertheless it has produced this brilliant song, with some really great solos.<br />- Journeyman<BR>The lads finish on a bittersweet note. A lovely acoustic number about one of their old band mambers. Some would say its rather cruel, but then they probably haven't just listened to  Virtual XI.<br />Ho, ho, ho.<BR>Honestly brilliant.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Once again, E. Badu never steers me wrong.  This woman's creative genius is inexpressable.  The album has many head-bobbin, finger-snappin moderate to update tempos that give you an old school, back to basics kinda feel.  Her talent is undeniable and you will not be disappointed.  So do yourself a favor and go out and grap a copy.  As a matter of fact, grab one for the wheels and one for the crib cause both copies will stay in heavy rotation.
0517548232|5.0|This should be required reading for every high school student. its easy to read, but right on the money. The clarity of the book belies its depth and accuracy. Hazlitt has written a wondrous book about the true nature of people and money, and how things should work.
B00002E23E|3.0|This is a great movie except for a few things.  The DVD footage has not been digitally mastered from the original source so picture quality is actually poor compared to what it should/could be.  Furthermore the sound on this DVD is not digital surround sound but just digital stereo.  These flaws are not Led Zeppelin's fault but Warner Brothers, who just don't seem interested enough to present this film like it should be.  So my advice is don't buy this DVD unless you are a dedicated Led Zeppelin fan willing to put up with substandard quality.  If you want to see and hear Led Zeppelin like they were meant to be then buy the &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot; instead.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|For those who simply can't get enough of Maynard James Keenan, Tool's lead singer was kind enough to create this side project.  On their second album, A Perfect Circle ups the creativity at the sacrifice of catchiness (for the most part), and so creates a work of art that will please devoted fans but will most likely not win any new ones.  Metalheads looking for a Tool substitute will be pleased with songs like &quot;Pet&quot; which provide a bit of crunch, but for the most part light guitar and string arrangements are the name of the game.  Don't get me wrong, the record is excellent and the talent of the musicians is apparent, but this is the type of music made for deep listeners.  With that in mind, I heartily recommend this album, but rock fans looking for a Tool fix should look elsewhere, as this group is something completely different.
B000002JNJ|4.0|This was the 2nd Pantera CD I purchased after Far Beyond Driven, and I should just say that Pantera were definitely better during their early days, before Phil Anselmo beefed up his muscles as well as his ego. He does sound amazing on this record though. Why? because he doesnt care to growl or gruff or slur vocals as he does nowadays, back then it was all about the high-pitched classic metal yells. I wonder if he can still sing like that, I bet he could if someone paid him enough. Anyone into early Metallica, Slayer, Overkill or any classic metal band should not be without this record. Plus all the fans of Progressive/Black/melodic/death etc (not that these styles are bad) who are growing tired of the same epic operatics, death growls, depressing i-wanna-die stuff and just looking for something fun should definitely pick this one up as well. <BR>The record starts out great with Cowboys from Hell, a fast paced classic with an attitude, things keep their pace with tracks 2,3, and 4. Track 5 \\"Cemetary Gates\\" is a classic metal tune everyone should own: THE.BEST.PANTERA.SONG.EVER.WRITTEN.PERIOD! This song does slow down the fast pace though, but it's ok, it's still an amazing song. The  kicking pace of this great cd continues with track 6,7 and you get the idea. Now why did I take off 1/2 a star you ask? Well, there were about 1 or 2 songs at most I didn't care for. One being \\"Clash with Reality\\" which was simply pretty boring. That's really about it though. Otherwise I have no gripes with this album. Classic Pantera rules! (no, not hair/makeup glam-metal pantera)
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Formidable and authentic, Johnny Cash's last album is a graceful unfurling of the paradox he kept in his back pocket next to his hankerchief. With tender hands strangling a human range of approximations, Cash comes through like a prophet, a reckless shadow waltzing to his glowing end. His cover of &quot;Hurt&quot; is likely the most effectual song we will ever know.
B000002IZ4|5.0|The Stone Temple Pilots &quot;found themselves&quot; in making their second album, &quot;Purple.&quot;  It sets the stage for future works, and could easily be integrated with their thrid album, &quot;Tiny Music.&quot;  Their musical abilities and writing styles are clearly demonstrated in this album.  The songs &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; and &quot;Kitchenware and Candybars&quot; reveal a level of music writing that had not been seen up to that point.  At the same time, songs like &quot;Vasoline&quot; and &quot;Big Empty&quot; carry on the distinctive sound of their debut album, &quot;Core.&quot;
0385504209|3.0|It's been awhile since I wrote an Amazon review, but after reading some of the hundreds of reviews of this book I'm compelled to respond on behalf of the vast unwashed masses to which I belong.  First, this book is found in the \\"fiction\\" section.  If you don't want challenges to documented historical fact, Amazon sells thousands of books on art and religious history.  Knock yourself out.<br />At its essence, this book is a better-than-average mystery thriller, with all of the typical plot devices you'd expect from the Grishams, Kings, and Pattersons of the world.  It's not particularly well-written, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to read, if you're just an average schmoe like myself who likes a deft plot twist.  To be sure, some of the developments in the book are far-fetched.  For example, I have no problem with one or two scenarios in which the protagonists face certain capture by the bad guys, only to escape by some implausible development.  After this happens a half-dozen times or so, you feel like Clark Griswold staring at the Grand Canyon.  Yep; been there, done that; let's move on.<br />So, what is it about this unremarkable book that seems to have inspired so many remarks?  That's easy.  It's about art, which brings all sorts of snooty bookish types out of the woodwork to nitpick; and it also delves into Christian conspiracy theories.  It doesn't flatter the church, especially the Catholic church, but that's nothing new in modern fiction.  But Brown's characters challenge the biblical accountings of Christ's life.  They also \\"uncover\\" thousand-year old religious conspiracies which changed the way people think about physical relationships.<br />These are sensitive issues, and a lot of linear thinkers don't like to have their fundamental beliefs challenged, even in fiction.  So no one should be surprised that so many of them have shown up to point fingers at this book because they spot a historical inconsistency or implausible conclusion about religion or art.  You're messing with some of the most pompous and arrogant people in the world, Mr. Brown.  The lightning bolt is surely on its way.<br />But from down here, among the vast majority of people who just want to sit down in a comfortable chair with a cool drink and escape into an interesting book for awhile, this one is pretty good.  If you have any interest at all in art history, or cryptology, or the early years of Christian religion, this one should hold your interest, but be warned.  If even a fictional challenge to your beliefs about Christianity or art history is going to offend you, move along.n or art.

B0000AZJXQ|4.0|My expectations were high when I first gave this album a listen, considering how much I loved Mer De Noms. Needless to say I was surprised, albeit not pleasantly surprised at first. Something seemed to be lacking, and not many of the songs could really keep my attention. However, something compelled me to listen again, and again and again, and with each listen I fell more and more in love with Thirteenth Step. As a truly great piece of art tends to do, this album grew on me, and continues to do so.<br />I like how this album opens up by drawing the listener in with a long and somber intro, unlike Mer De Noms. Interesting to hear Maynard using falsetto. Weak and Powerless makes a good single, I can picture Blue or Pet becoming the next. The Nurse Who Loved Me is a fun little Failure cover that makes me smile (though I still prefer the original). This album seems darker, softer and moodier than the first. The only gripe I have with this album, as others have mentioned, is the couple of filler tracks. Crimes just sounds like studio noise...and who's that singing on Lullaby? Maynard fooling around with his falsetto again? Paz making a guest appearance?<br />All in all, an excellent sophomore effort by an excellent band. A totally different animal in comparison to its predecessor, which is respectable in its own right. Thirteenth Step might not hook you at first listen, but there's a good chance you'll be in love by the third.
B000002AD0|3.0|When this 2-CD set was released, I jumped at the chance of having a pre-Woodstock recording of Santana. Unfortunately, far from the jubilation expressed from other reviewers, I found it to be a major disappointment. While the sound quality is excellent, and Carlos Santana and Gregg Rolie are in fine form, the backup sounded relatively bland to me. Being a percussionist myself, I must point the finger solely at Bob \\"Doc\\" Livingston, the drummer.<BR> <BR>While it's nice to have a documentation from his tenure with the band, and his playing is solid enough (with a decent version of \\"Jingo\\"), to me there was a \\"sameness\\" to his playing, relegating his role of time keeper rather than leading and propelling the band to higher places, which only started happenning after Michael Shrieve replaced Livingston. Listen to \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" (for one example). Just compare his playing to Shrieve's from the Woodstock performance (which, frankly BLOWS AWAY this collection) and you'll see what I mean. Every drummer that succeeded Shrieve carried on this tradition. To me this is a big reason why Santana is so successful (though definitely not the ONLY one). If Livingston continued with the band you would be looking at a very different Santana band indeed!<br />If you're new to Santana, check out \\"The Best Of Santana\\" then get their first three CDs (Santana, Abraxas, and Santana III), and if you want their live stuff, really any other live Santana CD will do.<br />Three stars for Carlos' and Gregg's immense talent! Otherwise, there are MUCH better releases out there.<br />Keep the peace.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|David is really hitting his stride again...for the 3rd time...in 4 decades. And, no, I will not go on saying \\"Well, this album is his best since [insert any Bowie album before Scary Monsters here].\\" David is still the biggest music fan on earth, and he shows it thru his music, blending any and everything he fancies. R&B/soul/doo-wop vocal harmonies melt like velvet over brooding, house-raising rockers like \\"New Killer Star\\" and \\"Searching For Water\\". \\"Never Get Old\\" proves that Bowie can still create those ecstatically quirky pop songs that only he can do(and followers such as Depeche Mode have tried to build on and perfect.) \\"Bring Me The Disco King\\" is the most innovative DB track i've heard in a while: disjointed, dissonant, elegant, soulful, paranoid, jazzy...classic brooding Bowie. \\"Disco King\\" also appears remixed on the recent Underworld soundtrack. Danny Lohner(from NIN) did a wonderful job on it(both are great in their own ways and i suggest having them both.) All in all, we've been given another lovely Bowie album with great lyrics and great sounds.
B000060OFT|1.0|This film is a shame. It is not a question of being old traditionalists or conservative close-minded Shakespeare lovers (I'm 26 years old and very much open to modern versions of old classics). It is simply unacceptable that, justified by some sort of &quot;freedom of interpretation&quot;, a director feels to be entitled to torture, rape and murder a masterpiece such Romeo and Juliet, turning a timeless love tragedy into a psychedelic, amphetaminic, rappy cross between a video-clip and and television advertisment, where the medieval beauty of wonderful Italian Verona becomes the depressing and violent misery of American Verona Beach (Verona Beach, would you believe it?!).<BR>There might be &quot;vibrant colors and costumes&quot; and &quot;kinetic widescreen cinematography&quot; (AMG), but except for Craig Armstrong's wonderful score, Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet is just rubbish. Even more upsetting is the Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction, which proves the fact that anything that is highly commercial, fast-moving, shot like a music video, utterly American and built to satisfy the needs of the miserable MTV - microwave dinner generation, will reach the Academy.

B00009MGQL|5.0|All I have to say is ,besides the background beats and voice overs,this is Jeff Beck at sonic noise and clean tones at its best.Why are people judging the background beats,people dont listen to hendrix for drum beats or his voice.People..stop complaining about the digital stuff.Listen to the guitar,if you cant hear it you have a hearing problem.This is slide guitar,wah wah pedal,massive tones,great melody,string bending at its best.

B00000260F|5.0|This cd is his worst but I like 5 or 6 songs out of it.And some classic albums have only 5 good songs on it and average guitar.So Ill give it 5 stars.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Just listen to the song &quot;The Package&quot; and tell me that doesn't give out the same feeling as the song &quot;The Patient&quot; from the Tool Lateralus album. Almost the same length, same build-up, same mood.<BR>That's probably why's it one of my favorite songs ;)<br />Stand-outs:<BR>&quot;Pet&quot; - I love the power in this song, the lyrics are just creepy as well.<br />&quot;The Outsider&quot; - Has a good flow, and maynards singing is excellent on this track.<br />&quot;The nurse that loved me&quot; - Cool little track.<br />Downfalls of the album:<BR>1. The fillers. &quot;Crime&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; are just some wacky instrumentals that dont really need to be on there.<br />2. 7 years for this album... I was expecting alittle more, but my APC desires are satisfied, for now.<br />3. Take out the two fillers, and maybe some of those slow pointless songs, you only got about 7 or 8 banging tracks.
B00008OWZC|1.0|What is the hype over Page.Page has no original sound because he stole it from the true master,JEFF BECK!
B00009MGQL|3.0|Poor engineering (come on,it's a guitar album, the guitar should sound fantastic instead of like an old Pod, and one of the greatest living drummers deserves a better sound) really sinks this album. Also, I'm still baffled as to why Jeff isn't using a bass player. The album suffers without one as well as his live performance (I saw him perform at Concord Pavilion). The keyboardist just doesn't do the trick. Finally, it really rankled me that I could find no credits for any of the musicians that appeared on the CD. Either a gross oversight or egomania at work. Still, Jeff's playing shines through and this second-rate offering from one of the greats is still worth picking up.
B000002UAX|5.0|Well, I do not have much to add to what others have written.  All I have to say is that this is THE BEST Beatles album ever!!! Although I agree that it may be a little disorganized, I still believe that it is the best.  This album alone demonstrates the range of music The Beatles were able to produce.  Upon hearing this album, I confirmed to myself that the Beatles are the best band to have ever existed.  All their music in general defined rock music and I believe that one cannot be a fan of rock music without agreeing that the Beatles are the best band ever.  So, this is an essential CD not only for Beatles fans, but also for all rock music fans.
B000002I7H|5.0|This is a great collection for the blues fan, that really showcases Albert King's talents!  My only wish would be that the songs were longer, but this is the way they were recorded and still worth their weight in the funk-shun of the blues! Magic!
B0000C8AUO|5.0|a bonus cd with the following tracks:<br />1.  Fly<BR>2.  Queen of all the tarts (overture)<BR>3.  Rebel Rebel<br />&quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;  appears to be entirely re-recorded.  Worth the few extra bucks definitely!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|The best album I've heard so far in 2003. Instead of redoing all the digital junk thats on R&amp;B radio she remains creative and keeps the Soul in the music. Very creative and revolutionary effort from Ms. Badu. One of her best albums to date.
0385512104|4.0|This is a fictional novel told in the voice and mind of an autistic teenager named Christopher.  It is a sad story but it is filled with magnificent moments and a keen awareness of autism.  It is both fascinating and heartbreaking.  When Christopher finds a dog that has been killed in his neighbor's yard he must figure out the mystery of who killed the dog.  His investigation leads him into unknown areas and he expresses his thoughts and concerns in a very intimate and yet detached manner.  Mark Haddon has rendered a clear voice for autistic children. While autism occurs in differing degrees, this is a focused and understandable peek into one world of an  autistic child and may bring understanding and compassion to those with autism and their families.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I bought this album this morning and was thoroughly impressed from the starting opus track, &quot;The Package.&quot; The buildup in that track is executed very nicely. Track 2; the single &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; is excellent as well. I am sure you have all heard it. Some standout tracks from my view would be &quot;Blue,&quot; &quot;The Outsider,&quot; &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me,&quot; and &quot;Pet.&quot; Those tracks drew me in immediately, they are just well astounding. Other tracks that I would place a little lower than those four would be &quot;The Noose,&quot; and the closer &quot;Gravity.&quot; The twelve tracks together just flow nicely into each other creating an enjoyable listen that is &quot;The Thirteenth Step.&quot;
B00006ZCFH|5.0|A soulful singer, behind an acutal band...THANK YOU.  <BR>Sophisticated ghettoizm as she puts it. Ms. Badu continues to prove she is a tru artist!! Somebody's gotta save R&amp;B!
B00009TB5G|5.0|First of all, this is deffinantly the best of the two Lord of the Rings movies.<BR>I am a Tolkien Purist, and the additions to the storyline were a bit weird and non-sensical to me, but they didn't really take anything from the pureness level. However, some of the stuff that they took out of the movie really irked me - until I watched the preview for the extended edition. <BR>The stuff with the forest swallowing the Uruk-hai is in the extended footage, as is the ent-draught scene, and even a scene i would guess would have to be quite lengthy - the scene after the destruction of the area around Orthanc and the flood and all of that stuff. <BR>I have no doubt that the extended edition will complete the already wonderful movie.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|As the title of this review implies, 13th Step is simply a rollercoaster of an album!  The new APC album has that rare ability to be extremely dark and melancholy while at the same time being absolutely beautiful and entrancing!  First off, Maynard has never sounded better!  He continues to explore and improve his already unique voice, adding new tricks to his repetoire!  Just listen to him on tracks like the Package, The Noose, and Blue and I'm sure you'll agree.<br />Billy Howerdel and Van Leeuwan replacement, James Iha, work brilliantly together to form powerful riffs.  However, they really shine in creating some very ambient, trebly guitar parts.  <br />Jeordie White is a fine replacement for Paz.  Check out the chord heavy intro to Blue!  Awesome!<br />Finally, Josh Freese seems to explore his drum kit much more than on Mer de Noms.  That was the one complaint from the first album....the drum beats were kind of generic and straightforward.  Freese has some very cool rhythms on this album that compliments the moody atmosphere perfectly.<br />If you are an unintelligent listener who likes your music spoon fed to you, this album probably isn't for you.  Quite frankly, your feeble little brain will probably explode.  However, if you have the IQ to appreciate something different that makes you think, you will LOVE this album!  It's as good as Mer de Noms, if not better.  Totally different sound, but just as amazing!  Stop reading and buy this album!!!
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|Let me preface this by saying I am usually a huge fan of Maynard's work in Tool and also the first A Perfect Circle album. I normally don't write album reviews but Tool and Maynard fans tend to give one-sided reviews. Even if Maynard just farted into a microphone some of his fans would call it genius and give the album five stars. So without further ado, here's my review. I loved the first APC album, so obviously I was expecting good things when I purchased \\"Thirteenth Step\\". After the nearly sleep inducing opening track \\"The Package\\" I just scrathed my head and thought \\"ok is this a joke or the real album??\\" (kind of like the first time I heard \\"Life is Peachy\\". :)After the album finished I was left still scratching my head and thinking \\"I demand a refund\\". This is one of the few albums I was really looking forward to this year and it's a massive disappointment. It sounds like APC spent all their time focusing on atmosphere, guitar tones, texture,etc. And along the way they forgot to write any songs :) Or any good ones that is. The single \\"Weak and the Powerless\\" IS the best song on the album and I wasn't overly impressed the first time I heard that either. I was supremely unimpressed with the Failure \\"Nurse Who Loved Me\\" cover as they totally sucked the life out of it. How does one turn a great song into something so mediocre sounding?? That cover song is representative of the rest of the album, it's just lifeless, pretentious and flat-out boring. When group members leave a band it's usually a sign of bad things, hence the departure of their bassist and lead guitarist during the recording of this album. If I was in the band I would have quit as well after hearing this material. Save your money, of if you've never heard of Failure. Your money is better spent on either \\"Magnfied\\" or \\"Fantastic Planet\\" (the album where The Nurse Who Loved Me is from)...
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Worldwide Underground was ANOTHER MASTERPEICE by da girl Erykah Badu. I been bobbin my head to Erykah since i was bout 8, im 16 now. The songs Bump It, Back In The Day, Woo, Danger, Funk You Up, and the Intro &amp; Outro are clearly the songs that shine tha brightest on Worldwide Undergound. The only disappointment I had with this album was that it was only 10 tracks long!!! I gotta say dat this CD left me wantin more uv dat laid back funk dat only Erykah can hit u wit. Big ups to you Erykah. Everybody out there.........DONT SLEEP ON THIS CD. GET IT.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Words cannot describe how great this cd is, Erykah Badu is a one-of-a-kind original who isn't afraid to step out and be creative.  Every track is well produced, instrumentally each set is unbelievable, and the cameos are there to enhance, not to try to fill up space.  For anyone who thinks this cd isn't all that, I suggest you purchase a real stereo system and listen again.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I think the problem here is that some people have taken to writing bad reviews for this album after only listening to the disc once, if that.  I am a firm believer that before you write a review you become familiar with the albums nuances first.  I've had the luxary of hearing this album for the past week at work before it came out yesterday.  Like some of you, upon the first listen I didn't think much of it at all.  Of course there were a few tracks that grabbed me like 'The Noose', 'The Outsider', 'The Package' and of course the lyric heavy first single 'Weak &amp; Powerless', but the other tracks seemed lacking in a way.  However, as the days passed by and the spins increased, I slowly fell in love with the subtle beauty of this album.  It became apparent that though this album, as a whole, is not as heavy or direct as 'Mer De Noms', it does have far more textures that only reveal themselves after repeated listens.  The tracks I originally panned off as filler like 'Blue', 'A Stranger' and 'The Nurse Who Loved Me' (and yes I realize it's not one of there own tracks, but it doesn't matter) became so stunning that when I finally heard them on my home stereo they nearly brought me to tears.<BR>Maynard and Billy have outdone themselves crafting a masterpeice here but only those who have an open mind and no pre-conceptions heading in will be rewarded.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC has really moved forwards with this album. It is longer and more interesting than Mer De Noms.<br />1. Package - Starts off slow but gradually turns into the heaviest song on the album. The lyrics are reminiscent of Flood from Tool's Undertow. 5/5.<br />2. Weak and Powerless - The first single from the album. Incredible lyrics and guitar but gets a little repetitive. 3.5/5.<br />3. The Noose - Beautiful song with great drums and vocals. It has an incredible ending that sounds a bit like 3 Libras, and it will likely be the second single. 4/5.<br />4. Blue - Interesting guitar effects, good beat in the chorus sections. There is a bit of strange-sounding reverb on the lyrics near the end. 4/5.<br />5. Vanishing - Below-average song, unmemorable. Lyrics about disappearing into the air. 2/5.<br />6. Stranger - Slow song with some VERY strange yelling noises in the middle. Lyrics about sex with tomatoes and what to do with silence. How about making some interesting songs to fill it? 2.5/5.<br />7. Outsider - Now THIS is more like it. My favorite song on the album, heavy and angry, awesome vocals and guitars. Lyrics are about fame and vanity. 5/5.<br />8. Crimes - Shortest song on the album, good drums but not much else. Total filler track. 1.5/5.<br />9. The Nurse who Loved Me - Total old-school orchestral rock song, sounds a bit like King Crimson. Violins and vocals make up most of it. It's a cover from a band called Failure, but i haven't heard that version yet. I love this song because it's so cheesy and classic sounding. 5/5.<br />10. Pet - Pretty heavy song with insane lyrics, and apparently with guest vocals by Devo, Maynard's son. A bit of great guitar solo makes this one of my favorite songs on the album. 5/5.<br />11. Lullabye - A continuation of Pet, with a girl with a nice voice singing softly. Very short song, basically filler. 1.5/5.<br />12. Gravity - The finale is a great song with amazing vocals, and a message to leave you with: \\"I choose to live.\\" 4/5.<br />Overall, it's hard to say which is better, Mer De Noms or Thirteenth Step. They're both art-metal albums and they both kick some serious @$$. I give this one 5 stars simply because I LOVED the Nurse song, otherwise i might have given it a 4. The half-naked girl from the Weak and Powerless video appears in the liner notes and on the back of the cd as an added bonus ;). There are more codes to decipher in the liner notes, like there were in Mer De Noms. This is a great album, but do NOT mistake it for Tool. They are completely different bands, so try not to compare them too much. 5/5.
0316666343|5.0|I am perplexed at the similarities between this book, The Lovely Bones, and a new television show coming out by producer Marti Noxon called Still Life.  It has a different circumstance surrounding the dead person's actual death but that's basically the only difference.  I wonder if Alice Sebold is being credited in any way...<br />Just Curious
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I really tried to love this album, but for those that were fans of the brilliant layering and depth of their first album, you will most likely be disappointed. I got past the first song, I thought, &quot;That was kinda cool I guess, a little minimalistic and 'toolish' for me, but I can't wait to see what's next.&quot; After &quot;Weak and powerless,&quot; the album returned to the slow rhythmic Nu-Metal type sound. Gradually I became more and more irritated as I listened further. It was obvious to me that Maynard had a huge role in the writing process of this album. They sound like a totally different band. When I describe these songs as &quot;slow,&quot; I am in no way referring to &quot;3 librasesque&quot; slow songs that the apc fan may be familiar with, but minimalist to the point that the most common sound to emit from your cd player will be silence. The drumming, the little that there was, and of course Maynard's voice are the only saving graces to this otherwise horrible attempt at an artistic vision.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This movie wonderfully great from beginning to end.  The dialogue is hilarious and the same time makes you think.  Esspecially when Hedwig explains his view on the orgin of love. The music is catchy and gets stuck in your head till you just have to either watch it again or go out and buy the soundtrack which is equally a wonderful as the movie.
630398021X|1.0|I saw this originally in the theater in 1995, and even then I thought they did a very poor job of creating a convincing \\"futuristic\\" environment, although the millennium was only 4.5 years away at that time. Except for the gimmicky memory-recording-cd- headgear (stolen from a very similar but more thoughtful movie in the 80s called \\"Brainstorm\\", Natalie Wood's last film), there is nothing science-fictionish about this movie AT ALL...neither does it have anything interesting to say about life at the turn of the new century.<br />Only 8 years old now and STRANGE DAYS plays as very dated and very creaky looking AND sounding. No mention of the internet although it was very much there in 1995. Cars, music and (very bad looking and unflattering) costumes scream 1995, and make no comment or interpretation about the near future.<br />Ralph Fiennes -- an otherwise fine actor -- is horribly miscast. Does no one even question why a former LA cop would have a British accent? He is totally unconvincing. Juliette Lewis, also capable of good performances although her overall screen career is terrible -- so horribly annoying you just want to slap her -- there is nothing here to suggest why Lenny Nero would be so obsessed with her except that she has a hot body and looks about 17. Ms. Lewis should have sued Kathryn Bigelow or James Cameron for presenting her in such a wretching unflattering way -- the film just makes her look awful with a bright red fright wig and unbecoming clothing.<br />A lot of really fine actors, including Michael Wincott, Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio, etc. are utterly and completely wasted in this dreck. Their characters are not developed in the slightest and they basically play stock stereotypes, i.e., the venal rock and roll manager, the crooked cop, etc.<br />Only gorgeous Angela Bassett comes out of this spelling like a rose -- she looks beautiful and plays a really tough, physical character. It's interesting to see the idea of a passive, weak male character being protected by a strong physical female protagonist, but it isn't explored in any interesting way here. You do get to see her kick some serious butt but that's all. The romance between Mace and Lenny feels tacked on, and has no erotic charge at all -- they only kiss briefly at the very end.<br />Horrible production values! The film is dark and not in some clever \\"noir\\" way but as if the director hoped she could hide the boring sets and ugly costumes this way. No interesting special effects or CGI. Violence is constant and gratuitous and adds nothing to the storyline but cheap shocks and a feeling (odd in a film directed by a WOMAN) of misogynism. The music -- a few bits of legit rock music (not much) and to pay for it, you have to listen to Juliette Lewis SING...aaarrrggghh.<br />Worst of all is the script, totally lame, violent, unoriginal. My first thoughts on seeing it in the theater was that there was almost nothing of science fiction here, just a cheap exploitative serial killer type of film with a gimmick (and not an original one, either), and that it has nothing to say about the millennium, which it SHOULD HAVE, being that it was filmed at the end of the 20th century. It's even more lame today considering all we have seen happen (the internet, 9-11, etc.).<br />Don't even bother to rent this one, let alone buy it. I am sure all the actors who particpated in this mess are sorry they did so.racter being protected by a strong physical female protagonist, but it isn't explored in any interesting way here. You do get to see her kick some serious butt but that's all. The romance between Mace and Lenny feels tacked on, and has no erotic charge at all -- they only kiss briefly at the very end.<br />Horrible production values! The film is dark and not in some clever \\"noir\\" way but as if the director hoped she could hide the boring sets and ugly costumes this way. No interesting special effects or CGI. Violence is constant and gratuitous and adds nothing to the storyline but cheap shocks and a feeling (odd in a film directed by a WOMAN) of misogynism. The music -- a few bits of legit rock music (not much) and to pay for it, you have to listen to Juliette Lewis SING...aaarrrggghh.<br />Worst of all is the script, totally lame, violent, unoriginal. My first thoughts on seeing it in the theater was that there was almost nothing of science fiction here, just a cheap exploitative serial killer type of film with a gimmick (and not an original one, either), and that it has nothing to say about the millennium, which it SHOULD HAVE, being that it was filmed at the end of the 20th century. It's even more lame today considering all we have seen happen (the internet, 9-11, etc.).<br />Don't even bother to rent this one, let alone buy it. I am sure all the actors who particpated in this mess are sorry they did so.
B00005NGAL|5.0|I am 13 years old and I've seen Cats 5 times on stage (four times in New York and once in London), but this was by far better than any of the other times! Elaine Paige was the best Grizabella I have ever seen...ditto Michael Gruber as Munkustrap, ditto Jacob Brent as Mistoffelees, ditto Phyllida Crowley Smith as Victoria, ditto Geoffrey Garrat as Skimbleshanks, ditto Aeva May as Demeter, okay, ditto almost the entire cast!<BR>Why do I say almost? There were a few people with whom I was not entirely impressed. Susan Jane Tanner was terrible as Jellylorum; as another reviewer said, \\"her voice sounds like rocks being rubbed together\\". I totally agree! She made the Gus number painful to listen to. Speaking of Gus...<BR>John Mills was okay, but he certainly wasn't the best Gus I've ever seen. And he DEFINATELY wasn't worth cutting Growltiger for! Why did they do that? Just because they had to make the movie two hours for television doesn't mean they couldn't have put the whole thing on video/dvd. Again, Ken Page was okay as Old Deuteronomy, but he wasn't the best I have ever seen. And James Barron was somewhat boring as Bustopher Jones.<BR>As I have said, this movie is wonderful, but there are a lot of mistakes in it. Some previous reviewers have mentioned them, but I've caught several that I think no one has said yet. <BR>On dvd, if you skip \\"Old Deuteronomy\\", the chapter change catches Munustrap in the middle of a word. Also, Skimbleshanks doesn't go offstage between \\"The Moments of Happiness\\" and \\"Gus the Theater Cat\\", but somehow he aquires his vest between the two. <BR>In \\"Macavity\\", after Macavity (Bryn Walters)steals away Old Deuteronomy, he comes back disguised as Old Deuteronomy. But in the background, Macavity is also showing the Jellicles that he's brought their leader back. Macavity may have powers of levitation, but he can't be in two places at once! <BR>Before Grizabella comes onstage for \\"Memory\\", Jemima (played excellently by Veerle Casteleyn, even thoughshe was dubbed) sings a verse of memory solo. But you can see Veerle's ear sticking out through her wig...also, in the credits where it says that Jemima was dubbed, they misspell it as \\"Jemmmima\\". Another misspelling is in The Making Of Cats. When they interview Michael Gruber, they spell Munkustrap as \\"Munkistrap\\".<BR>However, these are all little mistakes. There is only one which I personally think is completely unforgivable and should never have been made. After \\"The Moments of Happiness\\", all of the cats stand up and stare at the camera. There is a view of the entire stage. And in the lower right hand corner you can see a red light blinking from one of the cameras!!! I really think that mistake should not have been made, or at least been discovered while they were doing the editing. <BR>Overall, though, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, despite the mistakes. I would definately reccomend it to anyone! Even if you don't like cats or dance. My friend didn't like either, but then she watched this movie and loved it! It's more than worth the price. <BR>P.S. Did anyone notice what Jemima and Alonzo (Jason Gardiner) were doing in the background at the beginning of the Jellicle Ball (when everyone is still singing)?<BR>P.P.S. What does \\"kudos\\" mean??????????
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|On Mer de Noms, every track is brilliant and emotionally moving in one way or another.  The music itself was just beautiful and amazing. But their second album doesn't really seem to capture that same feeling.  The songs seem simpler and not as intricate. Maynard is my favorite singer,and his voice really makes or breaks every track.  Sometimes it seems that he's a little too angry and gruff for APC, but he's still awesome of course.  There are some very good tracks on this album, but there are also some that are just good.  So in comparison to the first album, this was just slightly dissapointing, but I guess that's because I was stupidly expecting more of the same...which is not what they are because of obvious losses and additions to band members.  But hey, it's still definitely worth the money, because if you like Maynard, you're gonna buy this no matter what anyone says, and it's still much better than other rock bands.  I want a new TOOL album!!!!!
0553296981|5.0|This work ranks as the number one child diary of the 20th<br />century. The book is well-organized and written.  It is a<br />fairly complete diarization of the day-to-day experiences<br />of a young teen during the height of the second world war.<br />The work documents the utter fright citizens can have of totalitarian instrumentalities. Anne documents the continuous<br />fear of discovery and considerable efforts required to survive<br />a sustained assault against her community during the height<br />of World War II. Ultimately, she succumbed to the all-pervasive<br /> surveillance.

B00004KD11|4.0|Mention the name Deep Purple and most people will say \\"Oh yeah, those guys who did that cool 'Smoke On The Water' song\\".  It really is a shame that so many people don't know about the ORIGINAL Deep Purple.  In their career, Purple had about 9 or 10 different lineups, but this one remains the best of them all (despite what uneducated fans and mindless critics will tell you).<br />The spaced-out psychedelic funk of \\"And The Address\\" is delicious, and it's a perfect album opener.  The groove is simply irresistible, especially that driving five-note guitar riff.  Blackmore sounds somewhat lethargic, but Jon totally steals the show with the mesmerizing sound of his trippy organ.  In fact, this is probably the only Deep Purple song in which the organ actually surpasses the guitar (a very rare occurence, believe me).  \\"Hush\\" was of course the big hit for the boys, earning them enormous success here in America, but hardly nothing in their native England.  But it's a killer song; Nick Simper provides a funky, rock-solid bass line, Rod Evans' vocals are to die for and Jon delivers some of his most amazing organ work.  Truly a classic.  \\"One More Rainy Day\\" is a soothing ballad, highlighted by some vocals from Rod that always put me in a state of euphoria.  He really is my favorite singer in the world, and what a sadly overlooked talent he was.  \\"Happiness\\" is Jon's unbelievable tour-de-force on the organ, and it might just be his greatest moment ever on the instrument (it even rivals his later workout on \\"Lazy\\" with mark two, probably even surpasses it).  The sheer amount of power and intensity must be heard to be believed, as his organ gets more and more intense, until finally, it's just an onslaught of earth-shattering sound accompanied by guitar and drums.  Absolutely devastating!  And it leads into their cover of \\"I'm So Glad\\", which is more or less the same as Cream's version, but slightly better.<BR>We're back to more psychedelic funk on \\"Mandrake Root\\", with a riff that many people say was stolen from Hendrix's \\"Foxy Lady\\".  Well, I don't know about that, but I DO know that this is an excellent tune, with a driving beat that is mostly due to the remarkable rhythm section of Paice and Simper.  Simper, in particular, is one of my favorite bass players ever, maybe even my number one, and another extremely underrated musician.  Anyway, Rod only gets to sing a few lines before Jon and Ritchie throw in some eerie, trippy solos.  <BR>Their cover of \\"Help\\" is unquestionably much better than The Beatles' version, I don't care what anyone says (I never saw what was so great about The Beatles in the first place).  It's much slower and much more emotional.  Evans' delivers one of the greatest vocal performances of his career, and the gentle organ and guitar notes are simply breath-taking in their beauty.  I heard that McCartney was quite envious when he heard this version.  <BR>\\"Love Help Me\\" is a cool little rocker with one of the greatest riffs that I've ever heard, and some deafening wah-wah licks from Ritchie.  And their version of \\"Hey Joe\\" is absolutely shattering.  Sorry, Hendrix fans, but this version completely blows away Jimi's.  For starters, there's the riff.  My favorite riff in all of music.  It's so powerful, heavy and massive that it probably is the heaviest riff of the 1960's.  It simply floors me every time I hear it!  God what a riff.  Anyway, the song features some dazzling organ from Jon in the beginning, then a few vocals from Rod, then a trippy guitar solo from Ritchie, and then the grand finale - they play that stunning riff again, but only FASTER this time!  Holy cow!  I love it, I love it, I love it!  Sorry, I got carried away for a second there.  Play this song at full volume and feel your brain rattle from that crushing riff!<br />God bless Spitfire for releasing these albums the way they should be released - with marvelous sound quality, detailed booklets and bonus songs.  And the bonus songs on this CD are all wonderful, especially the awesome \\"Shadows\\".  I just can't understand why the band didn't put this on the album when it first came out.  I mean - WHAT A SONG!  Great riff, intoxicating vocals and a weird wah-wah solo to boot.  The instrumental take of \\"Love Help Me\\" just chugs along like a monster, and it's very heavy for 1968 standards.  The BBC version of \\"Hey Joe\\" features even better vocals and guitar playing than it's studio counterpart.  The alternate take of \\"Help\\" is also much better than the studio rendition.  And the live version of \\"Hush\\" (recorded at Hugh Hefner's Playboy After Dark Show) is great but the sound quality is iffy.  <br />Overall, an excellent album.  And like I said, God bless Spitfire!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Disney Studios tends to use the word &#34;classic&#34; to describe every film it releases--but in the case of THE LION KING, the word is very apt.  And this double disk DVD &#34;Special Platinum Edition&#34; shows the film at its best.<br /><br />Unlike the recent DVD release of SLEEPING BEAUTY, THE LION KING did not require significant restoration, and if you have a VHS copy of a previous release you will not find the picture significantly different beyond the inclusion of a new musical number.  What you will find quite different, however, is the sound. The DVD offers you the option of the original soundtrack as it was first created for theatrical release or a home theatre mix--and if you have a surround sound system, the latter will add a great deal to your viewing experience.<br /><br />As usual in Disney's &#34;special&#34; releases, THE LION KING also comes with a great many bonuses.  I found them a mixed bag; at times they were little more than shameless self-promotion on the part of Disney, and they also tended to be repetitive.  But the bonuses do include a very nice audio commentary track and a number of fascinating interviews and short documentaries that will interest Disney fans, and there are several games (which can be played from the DVD remote control) that the kids will enjoy quite a bit.<br /><br />But the real power of this DVD release is, of course, the film itself.  Loosely suggested by everything from Biblical parables to African folktales to Shakespeare's HAMLET, THE LION KING presents us with a moral lesson about responsibility, courage and the need to confront past mistakes--precisely the sort of thing that you WANT your kids to watch but they always object to sitting through.  But they won't object to it this time: the film looks beautiful, it sounds great, and with its pageant of heroes and bad guys, comic characters, low comedy, and high drama it should hold them (and adults as well) glued to the screen.<br /><br />If you're not greatly interested in bonus materials or in the surround sound features and you already have a good quality copy of THE LION KING in your collection--you may want to give this new edition a miss.  But if you're a first time buyer or you're replacing a worn-out-from-viewing copy, this release is the way to go.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--rround sound features and you already have a good quality copy of THE LION KING in your collection--you may want to give this new edition a miss.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Although difficult to compare with A Perfect Cirlce's excellent debut album, 'Mer de Noms', The 13th Step is truly an amazing compact disc.  Starting slowyly [&quot;I'll take just what i came for <BR>then im out the door again.&quot;] and then kicking into an hypnotic heavy rythm, 'The Package' is a very good opener. 'Weak and Powerless', perhaps the the best track, or at least one with most popular apeal [both the radio single and music video] is certainly overpowering, both musically and lyricly.  Although there are a number of mellower, yet very good songs, on the album, 'The Outsider' seriously rocks, and with lyrics such as &quot;disconnect and self destruct, one bullet at a time<BR>what's your hurry, everyone will have his day to die&quot;, it does a nice job of integrating the theme.  'Pet', another POWER ballad, with lyrics such as &quot;swayin to the rhythm of the new world order and count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war<BR>drum&quot; criticizes the efforts of the Bush administration and the Media's attempt to smooth over the various complexities and difficulties involved with this issue.  'Gravity' is an admirable finale to this superb compilation.  This is definately an album that grows on you; listen to it at least 3 or 4 times, and if you are even a minor APC fan, this will satisfy your needs.  Although musically it is very good, the lyrics really are the selling point.  Maynard is a genius!
B00006ZCFH|4.0|I left work on my break to cop &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; on its release date, just to let you know how anxious I was to get my hands on some fresh material from one of my favorite artists.  The more I listen, the more I like and am now beginning to get the full vibe of this experiment. This project is layered with many textures, music changes, sounds, and moods. <br />One thing that makes this project a cut above the rest is the production, for example &quot;Danger&quot; is OFF DA CHAIN! When I first heard the track I was immediately moving (the horns, the Friday 13th-Jason piano, and Erykah's street savvy was too much to contain myself). I also like the transition into &quot;Think Twice&quot; which has a lazy vocal by Badu and scat and trumpet playing done by Roy Hargrove. &quot;Back In The Day (Puff)&quot;  has that old school-laid back groove to it. Lenny Kravitz contributes a funky electric guitar lick. &quot;Love of My Life Underground&quot; is a stellar track with Latifah, Angie Stone (Sequence), and Bahamadia revamping the classic &quot;Funk You Up&quot; 2003 style. I'm also feeling &quot;Bump It&quot; and the vocal ad libs at the end. I wish N'Dambi could have got in on some of that.<br />My only complaint is that the cd should have more tracks, with cd prices going down are cd's going to have fewer joints???<br />Pick up your copy of &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; and &quot;Bump It&quot;!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|It was the mid-1970s, singer-songwriters were everywhere, cranking out albums that focused on emotions and &quot;real life.&quot;  Joni Mitchell, Carole King, James Taylor, Richard Thompson and others wrote some terrific songs that had real emotional punch...and then along came Bob Dylan with the true masterpiece of that, or any other, era.  With &quot;Blood on the Tracks,&quot; Dylan simply restated his claim to the title of his generation's greatest musical poet.  With the exception of the cryptic &quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts,&quot; all of the songs on &quot;Blood&quot; are about relationships.  Never had Dylan pulled the curtain back so far to allow the public to view his feelings about his life and loves.  Taken as a whole, these songs make you feel you know this guy and what he has been through in the unending search for love.  And what songs!  Dylan has rarely been so tuneful and the wordplay is among his best.  These are songs that stick with you.  I've listened to this disc dozens of times and I always take away something new.  Amazingly, it is the lesser-known cuts, &quot;You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,&quot; &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello,&quot; and &quot;Buckets of Rain.&quot; that now stand, in my mind, as equals to &quot;Tangled Up In Blue&quot; and &quot;Simple Twist of Fate.&quot;  The SACD/CD 2003 version features a new CD remix and a 5.1 surround remix that keeps Dylan's voice (and &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is his best-sung album) up front where it belongs, but adds some separation for the guitars, bass and drums.  It's nice for surround fans, but it is the music that makes this Dylan's most timeless work.  It could have been cut on wax cylinders in 1900 and it would still be an all-time classic.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Not that I thought he ever left. This album is much better than<BR>&quot;Heathen&quot; which I liked, but definitely not as much...Too moody.<BR>Bowie is at his best sometimes covering other's. Young people do that today for hits, Bowie makes the songs his &quot;own&quot;, a classic <BR>of his &quot;Pinups&quot; is still the best album of his I own. &quot;Reality&quot;<BR>is the product of a recent flourish of songwriting David completed. That's a relief! Too many rock stars from his era today, just don't have &quot;it&quot; anymore. I have always enjoyed his music, since junior high school,because he was always experimenting and breaking new ground...I think he's returned to that. I'm glad...Is it &quot;Bowie-ness&quot;...I don't know what that means. The songs are good...better than Heathen and the Hours...<BR>though i like both. Ziggy and Halloween Jack aren't evident,<BR>but he rocks...especially covering the song &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;!<BR>I'm glad he's still rocking! David Bowie seems be riding a wave of fresh inspiration...If you are a long time fan, you'll enjoy this effort...I'm admittedly biased, he's the first artist whose albums I bought and enjoyed sometimes without previewing. I have more of his albums than anyone's...So, for me, its hard to actually dislike an album of his, except Never Let Me Down...<BR>This one is great, enjoy it!
0790749815|5.0|Isn't it interesting that the two best movies made by the great Alfred Hitchcock both starred Cary Grant?  He plays completely different roles in the two films.  In Notorious (Hitchcock's best movie) he is a sullen, lovestruck, jealous fiend who drives Ingrid Bergman into the arms of another man, using the love she feels for him and not confessing his love for her until it is almost too late and she is almost dead.  <br />However, in North by Northwest, he plays a funny, completely clueless advertising man who gets caught up in espionage within the first five minutes of the movie.  He is mistaken for a spy who is trailing a man named Van Damme (James Mason)  Grant is not a spy at all, but Van Damme won't hear any of that and attempts to kill him.<br />Grant gets away, of course and then the fun begins.  He tries to figure out what's going on and who the spy really is and Mason tries to get rid of him.  The ride takes you from Manhattan on a 2,000 mile trip to the face of Mount Rushmore.  Along the way, Grant meets a woman (Eva Marie Saint) who may not be who she seems to be, even when you think you have it figured out.  <br />The film is littered with reliable supporting actors including the hilarious Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's mother.  She absolutely steals her scenes early in the movie.  Leo G. Carroll, a Hitchcock regular, shows up to provide the movie's most critical information, and finally, a very young Martin Landau is James Mason's second hand henchman.<br />The famous scenes from this movie are the crop dusting scene featured on the cover of the DVD and the final chase on the Mt Rushmore face.  However, the whole movie is great to watch.  The story is just unbelievable enough to laugh at, but realistic enough to take seriously as well.  Grant is fabulous here, having lots of fun with the situations presented.<br />This movie is really atypical for Hitchcock, who was more about what happens in the mind than action on the screen. (See Notorious or Vertigo, possibly his most cerebral film)  Even movies like Psycho were more inside the head than the physical action (save the two gruesome murders)  But not North by Northwest.  There really isn't anything to figure out, it's just great actors going at breakneck speed for two hours and 16 minutes to duke it out on the face of Mount Rushmore.  What more can you ask for?
B000001GQT|5.0|Listening to this supremely committed performance by Karajan and the BPO is akin to being lashed by hot molten lava. So fiery and single-minded is the inspiration of this playing. Sometimes all that intensity can literally get too much. This is not an \\"Also\\" you can listen to repeatedly. The effects could be a migraine. \\"Also\\" can be performed from different perspectives. Kempe's sweet, delicate chamber-orchestra-like version is a good foil to this Karajan, as is the first Blomstedt.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Wow. She did it again. This CD brings that Badu energy that she if famous for. Original and funky. She brings in Roy Hargrove for some of that cool jazz and laces it with her voice. Bottom Line this is a quality CD. Buy it!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Originally this was posted with three stars on the day after the album was released , and while i still feel mostly the same, this album has grown on me, and i've kind of gotten over the fact that it sounds NOTHING like mer de noms, which while sad cannot be changed.  I would still recommend you to buy this album because it really does have beautiful songs.<br />Original Post--<BR>I think I read a blurb that one of the band members said about the album being in much the same vein as Mer de Noms. I can't dissagree more.  I definitely cannot see any likeness between the two albums. <br />While Mer de Noms was romantic, and dramatic, and angst-ridden, with lush guitars, and hard songs like Judith, Thirteenth Step is quiet, mellow, and almost happy in comparison.  And never, have I ever heard Maynard sound like this.<br />I'm not saying this is a bad thing. I'm just saying it's not at all what I was expecting.  Instead of turning the volume down on many of the tracks for fear of my neighbors banging on the walls, I had to turn the volume up. -__-<br />I will say that the best tracks on the album, imo, (in most favorite to least) are Gravity, The Outsider, Pet, Vanishing, and for reasons unknown to me The Nurse Who Loved Me, although I'm quite obviously a fan of the more heavier songs which is odd because my favorite track off of Mer de Noms was Orestes. :shrugs:<br />I will give APC props for being able to completely reinvent themselves in terms of sound and composition.  Bands that put out that same album over and over can be so tiresome.  I'm still a huge APC fan, despite my appetite for depressing and haunting songs not being met. oh well, maybe next time.
B000002H8F|5.0|First theres no such thing as a bad pixies album,but some are better than others.Surfer Rosa and doolittle are amazingly ahead of there time, but if I want to introduce someone to the pixies I do it with bossanova.Its simply the most easily digestable of all there albums and has something for everyone from the surf sounds of cecila ann to the in your face &quot;rock music&quot;it's also producer Gil Nortons finest work and shows that ol'black francis is capable of writing beautiful spacious songs like &quot;ana&quot; or &quot;havalina&quot;, the first two albums might steer the first time listener to think that all they do is rock! Black Francis is a genius and you can hear it on &quot;Bossanova&quot; and later on &quot;teenager of the year&quot; under Frank Black.Take it from a guy who has three pixies posters framed in his house and who has met Mr.Black twice<BR>at a sushi bar in the valley,Bossanova is not of this earth.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I love tool.  I loved APC's first CD.  Maynard James Keenan is a lyrical and musical genius.  So I have one question...what in the hell was he stoned on when he thought up this album?  This is quite possibly one of the worst cd's I have ever had the misfortune to spend money on.  Over half the tracks aren't even songs per se.  They sound more like that new age hippie [stuff] that you buy at head stores for white noise.  The tracks that actually have some musical content are extremely sub par, the only decent ones being \\"noose\\" and \\"weak and powerless\\".  It's obvious that keenan is aiming for the abstract and the deep with this album, unfortunately, He falls far short of this goal and falls into the realm of confusing and shoddy.  I can't believe i had to wait 3 years for this [cd].  And now, the part that ticks me off most is that I can't even return this mockery of an album because I had to remove it from its wrapping and now the store won't take it back.  this is [money] that I want back.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|EVER SINCE MER DE NOMS CAME OUT IN 2000, I HAVE SINCE ANTICIPATED THEIR SOPHOMORE ALBUM AND HERE IT IS!  THIRTEENTH STEP IS AWESOME!  I ADMIT THAT THE FIRST LISTEN DIDN'T QUITE EXCITE ME LIKE THEIR FIRST ALBUM. SO LIKE MANY GREAT ALBUMS,(ie PINK FLOYD'S THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON)I HAD TO GIVE THIRTEENTH STEP SOME TIME TO GROW ON ME. AFTER THE THIRD LISTEN, THIS CD HAS YET TO LEAVE MY STEREO.  KEENAN, HOWERDEL AND COMPANY DELIVER THE GOODS.  YOU CAN TELL THAT ONE OF THEIR GREATEST INFLUENCES IS FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS &quot;THE CURE&quot;.  EVERY TRACK SOUNDS LIKE AN APC FAN COULD HOPE FOR.  HOWEVER, THE BIG SURPRISE IS TRACK NUMBER NINE &quot;THE NURSE WHO LOVED ME&quot;.  THIS SONG SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING &quot;ENYA&quot; WOULD COMPOSE (ALSO ONE OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS) ALL IN ALL, EASILY ONE OF THE YEARS BEST RELEASES.  A MUST HAVE FOR ALL APC AND TOOL FANS.  KEENAN'S VOICE IS SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT!

B000002U82|5.0|For fellow music enthusiasts, there is no reason to outline the musical value of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  You can read that anywhere, from any pretentious critic.  Truth is, I didn't know about truly loving rock and roll until I heard &quot;Dark Side.&quot;<BR>The first time I heard &quot;Dark Side,&quot; I cried.  My closest friend and I like to sit in her basement or her beautiful yard and play this album, just marinade in it.  We all drive out to an insignificant location, lay on the car, and listen to the album all the way through.  (Always all the way through... the only way to do it, in my opinion.)  My dad listened to the album and felt it; now, amazingly, I do as well.  How many things can you say that about?  Bottom line, this album is life, it's everything.  It is the most passionate music I've ever heard.  And in case you were questioning the old stoner legends, it does indeed coincide with every event in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  Tried it, and it was amazing.  <BR>Listen to this album alone, listen to it with your friends.  It will quite seriously make you breathe deeper.  Just listen.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This is so reminding me of Brian DePalma (I remember commenting the first ten minutes into Identity).  There is no doubt that director James Mangold is drawing heavily on a DePalma influence, or perhaps tapping into a Hitchcock vein.  Whatever the case, this thriller is just the fix I've been after without even realizing it.<br />I admit to being partial to the cast.  John Cusack (Ed the limo driver with a past) is an actor I will go out of my way to see any time; needless to say, he is brilliant here too.  Amanda Peet, playing a hooker trying to turn her life around, brings her trademark tough smarts to the role and does a great job as always.  Ray Liotta plays his usual sinister-guy-posing-as-normal character, but here it fits nicely.  Rebecca DeMornay's washed-up TV star part is brief enough to nearly qualify as a cameo, but memorable.  The rest of the crew complement this roundup as the assorted bunch that arrive together at the isolated motel on that fateful stormy night that a murderous evil runs amok somewhere outside - or is it inside?<br />Never fear, this is no mere slasher flick. This *is* a deliciously creepy Whodunit with an added slice of suspense. It is also a real psychological thriller in the old school sense.  In true Hitchcockian tradition there is an underlying plot that manages to bring together the seemingly random people and events that clash so chaotically. The little clues that are dropped here and there are just intriguing enough to give us a taste for the twist that we just know is coming (why is there blood on the back of Ray's shirt just before he covers it up with his jacket?  What's up with the Indian tombs outside?)  Naturally, there is also a false lead or two.  By the time the real killer is revealed we can click those puzzles pieces together with great satisfaction and wonder at how we didn't see the big picture all along.<br />If I had to compare Identity to another recent film, I would say Memento is the closest in style and quality.  In any event, I'd recommend Identity to anybody who enjoys this classic thriller subgenre.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B000002TYK|4.0|i think dave grohl is a genius simply for taking the ashes of his former band and building a new band that sound like nothing i have heard as much as it sounds familir.  not many drummers can write songs as catchy, musical, melodic, emotional and diverse as dave did.<br />  of course there will be lyrical as well as musical references to nirvana & kurdt.  sorry, dave, that comes with the territory.  still, this is one impressive debut.  my favorite song is the last one which is exhausted.  i love when the chorus kicks in.  what a riff!!!  but the best is is the verse guitar.  in it i hear world weariness and such a fatigue that it reaches to the soul.  also of note is the song for all the cows.  if you listen to the song and i mean really listen.  there are these little things dave does on guitar which i find so tasty (and quite jazzy like on the song for all the cows).  it makes the music so unique.<br />  the music, to me, is pretty diverse.  there is punk inpsired mayhem (dave was formidable in the dc hardocre band scream before joining nirvana) as well as melodic rock, noise guitar(i love the feedback at the tail end fo exhausted) and straight ahead rock.<br />  all in all a GREAT start and worthwhile venture for my favorite drummer.  if you can find their vidoes(i know it is hard now that MTV stopped playing videos which is funny.  music television has little to do with music), try to catch them.  funny stuff.  dave is unique and creative.  the only real weak point to this album is the fact that dave wrote, arranged and played pretty much all the parts on this album so this album can come off as lacking energy and seeing a bit dispassionate but i still love it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|There's no denying the influence of the Beatles nearly 40 years after they've disbanded. And the fact that The Beatles 1 turned out to be the #1 album of the year 2001,is justification enough.   But why buy this CD? First for any Beatle fan who,unless they have a CD burner,had to buy the over-priced four CD 1962-70(the red & blue collection)which could've collectively fit onto two CD(omitting two songs),yet not have the hits on one disc.   Second,for the upgraded sound which is an improvement from the 1987-88 CD releases of the original albums(which should call attention to Apple/EMI to remaster the entire catalogue).   Third,as a sampler to the uninitiated(given it's sucess,it has done it's job well).   Although Please Please Me,Strawberry Fields Forever,Nowhere Man & many classic songs are missing (although Lady Madonna and The Ballad Of John & Yoko could've been spared),It still shows how a little rock band evolved and changed pop music in less than eight years(amazingly prolific considering an artist like Michael Jackson has released only two albums in that amount of time).   If Beatles 1 really serves a purpose,is that it will lead the uninitiated to Rubber Soul,Revolver, SGT Pepper,The White Album, Abbey Road...........
B000089RVX|3.0|evanescence bring together equal parts hard rock and gothic music.  there is a darkness to the music and especially the lyrics which are mostly dark but still retain some kind of faith(more like spirituality) to let the light shine at the end of the dark tunnel.  <BR>     its hard to describe but id say tori amos meets linkin park with a goth edge, or the cranberries meets queen of the damned sounddtrack.  the singer, amy lee, has a beaufiful voice.  it is both haunting and pretty.  there are some killer riffs and some beautiful chord progressions here.  i like the eerie feel this album gives off.  <BR>     there is not much new here but is still powerful, chilling and quite amazing in its execution.  the music is melodic and has a vibe all its own.  it is a good start for this band from little rock arkansas and i do recommend it
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Wow!!!!! I have to concur with some of the other reviews I've read here and say too that so far, this is the best CD I've purchased in 2003!  Get into &quot;Freak Quency.&quot;  You will not be disappointed.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Magnificent! Words cannot  describe the beauty!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Maiden lost themself after &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; album. Some &quot;experiments&quot; with Bayley did not succed. Maiden was getting better and better after the worst for me album (X Factor), and the not so good &quot;Virtual 11&quot;. &quot;Dance Of The Death&quot; prooves that Maiden finally found their music and style. It can be many aspects concerning if this album is good or bad (for me and many other is very good) but Everyone should agree that is a PURE IRON MAIDEN sound. And this is that really counts. <br />Up the IRONS my friends!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised that every single song on this CD was good.  I was waiting for there to be just a few good ones, namely the ones on the radio, but that's not the case with this CD.  Every song, from beginning to end is phenominal!!  It's a must buy!
B000089RVX|1.0|Please, please, for the love of god, stop labeling this band even close to genre of metal or rock or goth, or any other good genres.  Rolling Stones once called them metal behemoths, I currently have the writer of that article in my basement laid agianst hot coals for starting that lie.  i will proceed to break his arms tonight.  Please she is not that good of voice and they do not play good guitars.  Try Nightwish or Lacuna Coils, both have female vocalists who sing better and look a lot better than the peice of lard known as the lead singer of evenascencse
B0000508U6|5.0|This is a work of art. It is raw and beautiful, Chris Martin pours his soul into every song. If you, like me, hate computer generated hip hop beats and people who couldn't actually play a musical instrument to save their lives, not mentioning any names but ahem, Beyonce, give this a go. It is stunning! If owners of the album just take the cd straight out when everythings not lost finishes, leave it in a little longer. There is a hidden bonus track, Life Is For Living, a short but tuneful and catchy song. Just thought I'd let everyone who was missing out in on this! Incedentally, if you also own So Much For The City by the Thrills this also has a bonus trak a minute after Til The Tide Creeps In finishes.
B00006AW2J|5.0|If I was stuck on an island and could only have three albums in my possession, they would be: The Rolling Stones &quot;Beggars Banquet,&quot; The Who's &quot;Tommy,&quot; and Echo and the Bunnymen's &quot;Crocodiles&quot; - in that order. &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot; is the only record of music that - on two sides of glorious vinyl - captures the true spirit, heart, mind, soul (and TALENT) of all of the original members. Since 1975 they've become a concert band, giving the fans an album of throw-away numbers. I couldn't provide you with any of the titles of these LP's if you held a gun to me head. The three albums which capture the essential Stones begins with &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and ends with &quot;Sticky Fingers;&quot; &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; being a sort of well-structured musical bridge between the two. &quot;Beggars Banquet,&quot; which really began in the studio with the hit single, &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; (what an awesome title) is the apex of the Stones career. As a sidebar, I thought their live album, &quot;Get Yer Ya Yas Out&quot; was equally good in most respects, peaking with the live quintessential Stones' &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; masterpiece. &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; is saturated - and anchored - in solid grassroots blues numbers. &quot;Prodigal Son,&quot; &quot;Parachute Woman,&quot; &quot;Factory Girl,&quot; &quot;No Expectations,&quot; and &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; are highlights for me. The Edward Hawkins' Singers-influenced &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; is a gospel precurser to &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want,&quot; and &quot;Jig-Saw Puzzle&quot; is a lazy, retrospective, rainy-day sort of tune you want to curl up in front of a fire with. Standards like &quot;Sympathy for the Devil,&quot; &quot;Stray Cat Blues,&quot; and the dated &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; were cutting edge back in 1968, and showcased the Stones' dedication to provocative social commentary. Brian Jones, for all of his personal problems (and this, his last full effort with the band) puts a sharp point on Richard's best guitar work ever, with his slide guitar, mandolin, and harmonica work. Mick's vocals are in top form, and he stretches his range in a way that he never is quite able to repeat on later works without sounding like he's trying too hard. Even Charlie Watts exceeds himself with respect to heavy latin and gospel styles, bongos, and Indian-related percussion. Though both an experimental album and a return to their blues roots, it never quite sounds like either. It is a well executed love-fest with what they do best, and I only wish they never strayed (no pun intended). For myself, listening to it over and over these last 20 years just makes this wish even more dire. The remastered version of this CD is a must-have, and like some of their old vinyl releases state on the sleeve: &quot;Play this Album Loud.&quot;
0671027344|5.0|I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower over the summer. When I started to read it, I couldn't stop. It's my favorite book. It touched my heart, soul, and mind in many ways. If you haven't read it, than read it. I read for 5 days straight, I just couldn't put it down. Get it and you wouldn't reget it.
0694003611|5.0|I have 4 kids ages 9,8,5 and 1.  What a wonderful book.  We are on our 2nd board book because it has been read so many times.  They especially enjoy finding the little mouse. Enjoy!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Any real fan would buy it without hesitation anyway, but what next? This album will stay in the cd player for a long time just like Brave New World did. It is a much more melodic album vs BNW but the chorus parts are a little weak, repeating the same words over and over. Maiden has recorded a very good album, it may not be as \\"heavy metal\\" as it used to be but still they are one of the best bands around.
B000084T18|1.0|This is so sad...I can't believe what people will do to go along with the crowd. This IS NOT music. There is no art to this. 50 cent is a talentless bum. Seriously. Hip Hop is knocking on death's door with garbage like this being at the top of the charts. At 15 and 16 hip hop/ r&amp;b was my fav kind of music. I'm now 21 and I only listen to alt &amp; punk rock. Why? It could be because of stupid so called rappers like this guy, or maybe I woke up and realized what real music is.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A PERFECT CIRCLE rocks.  In a time when rock music mostly sucks, a band like this dwells in a tower of original creativity on top of the citidel of dignity.  MER DE NOMS was a great first act, showing alternatives in music never taken by most acts that found their material on the airwaves.  The same unique soundscape continues on THIRTEENTH STEP, an album that has more mood and sorrow than it's predessesor.  The best thing about this band is their ability to conjure complete beauty whether the song is a quiet luller, or a violent stomper.  This record has a little more of the former, making it a more mellow outing with a lot of hints of regret and sadness.  MAYNARD may very well be the most enigmatic person in music today, proving once again that he can front two excellent acts without loosing a drop of his creative juices.  His voice is so hauntingly elegant and so penetratingly dark it gets into your head and won't let go.  The guitars and drums are superb, weaving an environment of sound so rich it's like a dessert that kills you upon consumption.  The entire disc is rock solid and flows at a pace that'll make you forget about that thing we call time.  There is no standout track for they all are, especially the band's strange but creamy cover of FAILURE's THE NURSE WHO LOVED ME, a great song if you're going to cover one though I wonder the point (I like the FAILURE version slightly better).  Sound quality is polished as is the production and artwork making the entire package perfect if not circular.  THIRTEENTH STEP is a must have item for any collection of good music.  Excellent.
B000060P79|2.0|It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good, and his voice may grate on your nerves. People bash Avril because they say she is a poser. Avril's never said she's putting out punk music. These guys believe they're punk....they aren't. Still, if you like sugar-coated, trl/radio friendly pop...with the tiniest breath of punk in it, then by all means, you can't go wrong here. If you want real punk rock, go with AFI. I would also like to urge you to check out KILL HANNAH, a little known band whose cd is coming out sometime next month.
B00006690G|1.0|Eminem is GARBAGE!!! this POP-SINGER will never get over Kim no matter what he says she always comes up one way or another he is ALWAYS TRYING TO GET HER ATTENTION he tries to lie with that stupid &quot;Superman&quot; track but everyone smart shes right threw it.

B00000K19E|2.0|Yes yes this movie was execellent, the first time.  Then I watched it again, after getting it on dvd and almost returned it.  Maybe its just me but Keanu Reeves can't act for nothing.  And what is it with people and bullet time?  Everyone says its so new and has never been done before.  Well, I hate to break it to you all, but it has.<br />Pick ANY movie directed by John Woo, and while you won't get as much bullet time, you will get some.  To give a more obvious example, the movie IRON MONKEY that was chorieagraphed by the same people, and had as much bullet time as the matrix, well that movie was made and released in China 5 years before this movie was made.<br />The story is also kinda hard to follow the first time.  You will need to see it at least twice.(that is not a bad thing) One thing I will say that I like about this movie are the general special effects.  And all 3 actors who play the agents do a great job.  There is also this extreamly pathetic love story, that probably would have made the movie much better had it not been there.<br />The special features of the DVD are, well....not so special.  Its besically the Wachowski brothers talking about how they think they no it all.  The musical score on the other hand is really cool.<br />Don't be fooled by how everyone says this movie changed the way movies are made.  If it changed anything, it changed the fact that we don't need big time famous actors to make a decent movie, just a lot of stuff blowing up and lots and lots of special effects.  I mean, I don't even think Trinity looks that pritty.<br />If you want this movie, go ahead and get it.  But rent it once or twice first and you probably wont be watching it again.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|I have to start by saying that i am a HUGE Erykah fan. I have been patiently waiting for this album to come out for months. It was repeatedly postponed which I hoped was a good sign.. meaning I thought she was waiting to release it until she knew it was good. The album isn't horrible but it pales in comparison to Baduism and it is hard to believe this is from the same woman who gave us Mama's Gun. I have not taken Mama's Gun out of rotation since I purchased it in 2000. Mama's Gun has got to be one of the best albums ever produced (in my opinion) My initial reaction to Worldwide was disgust but it is starting to grow on me.. It's lacking good lyrics, substance and the flow of a cohesive album but if you love Erykah I think you will enjoy this album but not love it. <br />So on to Worldwide [better left] Underground. It starts off with World Keeps Turnin.. Its not really a song nor do I think she intended it to be.. there's some soft music for about a minute and a half and she occasionally tells us in a softer voice that the world keeps turnin'. The next track &quot;Bump It&quot; FT Caron Wheeler &amp; Zap Mama is a bit lengthy.. The first half is okay.. lyrics are weak and repetitive and not interesting, empowering , reflective or insightful or anything that I have grown to love about Erykah. Instead she talks about how she likes to listen to her music loudly.. but the song eventually morphs into something else entirely and you wonder if by chance you are on to a new track. If you are familiar with Zap Mama's music then you will probably appreciate the latter half of this song. It sounds very much like something from &quot;A Ma Zone&quot; (which i highly recommend)It is mostly incomprehensible singing of sorts but sounds fun. The next song &quot;Back in the Day&quot; has grown on me a bit. The first time I heard it I was really annoyed with it but it has since become one of the few tracks I enjoy. Track 4.. &quot;I Want You&quot; is a bit much for me.. it's lengthyand repetitive and I don't wan't it. Which brings us to track 5.. I heard her perform this live in Denver and was underwhelmed with it @ her show. She borrows lyrics from previously released songs &quot;Today- Earth Song&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot; .. the two verses in this song are not new.. just set to a background of people hollering &quot;Woo&quot;.. while it sounds fun and is one of the better songs on her CD... I wooed myself right along to the next track.. Track 6 &quot;The Grind&quot; Ft Dead Prez... This song should be on a Dead Prez CD FT Erykah Badu.. As she really isnt highlighted on this song.. I wouldnt even call it a duet.. She is more like background vocalist on this track.. as this song fades and the next track starts (Track 7) We are brought to &quot;Danger/Otherside of the Game PT2&quot; I like this song. It is easily the best track on the album but no Bag Lady or Tyrone. The lyrics are great, the beat is good.. its a great song and yet I felt no connection to it.. My lover isnt in jail or prison and im not hustling drugs.. Only Erykah could pull this song off and she does it quite nicely.. Listen to &quot;Danger&quot; with the volumer turned up loud!!! The next track &quot;Think Twice&quot; is great.. Lyrics are a bit weak but it is a pleasant song performed with Roy Hargrove. It's a noice joint. If you like this song check out the CD titled &quot;Hard Groove&quot; by Roy Hargrove and his band RH Factor. Erykah, Q-tip and Roy sing a song called &quot;Poetry&quot; on that CD that is better but with a simliar sound. The next track &quot;Love of My Life Worldwide&quot; is a remake of an old Sequence song title &quot;Funk You Up&quot; It is one of the better tracks on this album and a redeeming end to a bizarre CD. As that song ends we are quickly brought back to where we started as Erykah returns us to the &quot;World Keeps Turnin&quot;<br />I would recommend this to fans of Erykah.. If you are not familiar with her. DO NOT start with this album.. I think you would have to already appreciate her to appreciate this CD. While I rated it low, I really am starting to enjoy this CD.. The low rating is because I think she is capable of putting out better and more meaningful music than this. In that light it was a bold move to release something like this to her fan base.. Perhaps this should have been released as a B-Sides or something. Bottom Line.. Erykah is still more talented than 90% of what is out there.. she'll be back and she'll bring us something real.. If you ever get a chance to see her live do not pass it up..
B00006G8K0|4.0|Horror of Dracula, Christopher Lee's first performance as The Count, is surely among the finest versions of Bram Stoker's classic tale. Lee has amazing presence and style as Dracula and his is certainly one of the definitive portrayals of the classic character. Having just seen both this film and Tod Browning's classic 1931 Dracula film in close proximity, I am eager to compare and contrast them. <br />Browning's film is older and grittier and it benefits greatly from this. The raw, black and white photography gives it an incredibly eerie, creepy atmosphere which is missing from Horror of Dracula. Browning's film bore the influence of German Expressionism, particularly F.W. Murnau's classic Nosferatu. This sense of atmosphere, along with Bela Lugosi's knockout performance as the Count is what makes the 1931 Dracula great. <br />Hammer Films' Horror of Dracula from 1958 was filmed in Technicolor and has no trace of that German-Expressionist creepiness. However, Horror of Dracula has many advantages over the earlier film. For one thing, the performances are far better. Peter Cushing is perhaps the greatest Van Helsing ever, and Christopher Lee's Dracula is excellent. Horror of Dracula moves by faster and feels like a more cohesive whole, not to mention that the ending is far better than the ending of Browning's film.<br />Horror of Dracula is an incredibly solid variation on the story. Keeping in mind that it was made in the late '50s, I think most viewers will be satisfied. It's more enjoyable than the 1931 Dracula, but far less atmospheric. The performances of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee propel this fine film. I just wish that Christopher Lee was given more screen time. His Dracula appeared onscreen significantly less than Bela Lugosi's. He doesn't even speak at all in the second half of the film. Lee's powerful voice is one that demands to be heard.<br />The DVD is nice, but could be better. The picture quality is great for a 45-year-old film. However, the disc is seriously lacking in supplemental material. Christopher Lee is an extraordinary man to listen to, and any commentary track with him is worth listening to. Lee did a commentary for the forgettable Hammer film The Devil Rides Out, but none for the classic Horror of Dracula???? At the price point that Warner is selling this DVD at, there should at least be some decent extra features. However, extras or no, this film is indispensable for horror fans.
B000089RVX|1.0|ahem.... dont you just love it when a band such as Evanescence are falsely rewarded as being innovators of a musical genre when all they did was water down and commercialize it? it makes me sick how people say Evanescence is great and original. Their male singer's vocals are so so bad, probably after loads upon loads of studio doctoring. Amy Lee is overrated as well. She holds the same key throughout 'Bring Me To Life'. its laughable, but ah well, the whiney spoiled 14 year old kids need music too, its just too sad that they choose garbage such as this.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This recording, Dylan's best so far as I'm concerned, is now much better than ever.  The sound, and particularly Bob's voice, is crystal clear and the very tastefully done 5.1 surround mix adds a whole new dimension. It's kind of like if you love Van Gogh's &quot;Starry Night&quot; and then someone removes a dirty glass that has obscured it and then...Oh Wow! It's in 3D!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|At first this album seems like a far cry from Mer de Noms, but give it time.  APC takes a different approach to this album, so if you're just looking for a catchy tune, look elsewhere.  However, if you give this album a few listens, you'll be able to appreciate its subtle nature.  The Noose is probably the best track on the album, complete with some of the best lyrics I've heard in a while.  There are plenty of majestic sounds on this album, and they will take some getting used to.  However, it's been a LONG time since anyone has produced a truly new sound, and APC delivers something that defies definition here.  Like the sound or not, APC goes a long way in defining themselves with this album.  But if you're not into mind-bending melodies, stick with Tool.
0743455967|4.0|I read this entire Stephen King book and didn't get scared once. Well, maybe once when the King talked about wiping his &quot;rearend&quot; with poison ivy as a kid -- like that story hasn't been told before ... Although Stephen does give us some good mechanical writing skills advice -- refer to Strunk and White's The Elements of Style -- like that lesson hasn't been told before -- also it helps to be an English teacher, to be honest with yourself, to know the limits of your own vocabulary, avoid using adverbs (religiously)and to have a 9-to-noon-or-5 work ethic (what some of us might consider to be -- work). I have to admit that The Long Walk (one of Stephen King's short stories) is one of the more memorable short stories I've ever read ... (although, come to think of it, that wasn't too scary either ... ) Stephen seems to suggest that if you don't follow his modest guidelines, you'll most likely end up writing instruction manuals or end up in some other dead-end, demeaning profession (which is actually what I've done for over 20 years)... Well let me tell you something Mister Stephen King -- your book On Writing -- it's not Edgar Allen Poe ... (not that I ever even met Edgar Allen Poe ) ... but as a manual on how to write anything, ... it ain't bad ... quoth the Raven -- &quot;Nevermind ...&quot;
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have listened this album lots of times already and I can not still take it out of my player. This is a new step for APC,songs just flows over you and nothing scratches your ears , songs are complete in everyway you can assess them. It is sure that new members brought what is missing to the band. Album has everything that a classic needs, perfect songs (The Outsider, Weak and Powerless, Blue, Pet) surrounded by out of standard tuned ones.
6305922756|4.0|The movie itself deserves five stars and the special features are just gravy, but I want to understand EVERY WORD, and when everybody's mumbling at the same time I need help!
B00006RU5B|4.0|After picking up this album a few months ago, i soon realized what i had hoped for.  The massive build-up was all worth the wait.  As a long time fan of the best era in music (the grunge era), i can tell you this group is for real.  I never really got to into Rage, but as a guitar player, i know Tom Morrello is about as good as it gets these days.  <br />His trademark Rage sound comes through on &quot;Set It Off&quot; and &quot;Cochise&quot;.  Just listening to his guitar playing along with the strong base lines definitely makes the album.  And then you have Chris Cornell.  His voice shines on the albums 2 best songs &quot;Like a Stone&quot; and &quot;I am The Highway&quot;.  Fans of an awesome acoustic song will love &quot;I am The Highway&quot;.  Cornell takes you through his every emotion and puts forth his best lyrical effort.  Other songs that truely combine the early SoundGarden with Rage Agaisnt The Machine sound are &quot;Gasoline&quot; and &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;.  If you are a fan of good rock music, do yourself a favor and go pick up this album.  And if you missed AudioSlave at Lollapalooza, what a shame.
B000053GTF|5.0|If you love Celine, you will listen to this, like I, again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.<br />It is pure entertainment, at its best!
B0000C8AUO|4.0|First of all let's get real. There are no real rockers here. A few gems, but I allowed myself to believe the hype of past reviewers by thinking so.  Compared to most albums these days, cool. As a Bowie, it's somewhere still in midrange.  This album's reminds me more of Never Let Me Down in style and feel. Great cover art. Trackss like Never Get Old &amp; Loneliest Guy seem uninspired. But having the bonus disc saves it at the end.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Trully a brilliant album, once again. It will go down as a classic. Some extreemly heavy riffs, probably some of their heaviest ever (Montsgeur, Dance of Death, Paschendale) and compare perfectly to songs like The Trooper, Back in the Village, Sea of Madness. But most, as with most of Maiden's other songs, have some trully fantastic slower melodies, and those remind me a lot of Murders in the Rue Morgue, Children of the Damned and such. There's even a trully Maiden balad at the end, Journeyman. I've been waiting for another ballad like this, and they nailed it. A lot like Prodigal Son. But as much as they remind me of older songs and albums its trully unique. Brilliant job guys.
B0000029DD|5.0|I heard of Buckley after seeing a concert of The Tea Party in which Jeff Martin did a cover of &quot;hallelujah&quot; and stated beforehand that &quot;we've lost a kindred soul&quot; or something to that effect.  I grabbed a couple songs off of Napster and was quite impressed, but nothing prepared me for the moment I heard this full album from beginning to end.  There is simply something that you can't touch about Jeff Buckley's sound.  his art is nothing short of utterly haunting...his flexible voice can reach the heights of heaven and delve to the fires of hell in a single breath, his musicianship is both accessable without being compromising.  melodic while maintaining a level of oddity and quirkiness.  He is both deathly serious and lightheartedly humourous...rock and acousic...yin and yang.  This album was sadly to be Jeff's final complete work, and while we can still grasp at phantoms with his (incredibly innovative and touching) bootlegs and other recordings (sketches from my sweetheart the drunk for example), there is a sadness that this album will never fully be followed up to.  At moments you almost feel that this was simply Jeff's warmup, and that if he hadn't been stolen from us so early there would have been magic weaved by him in the future.  Unfortunately this is the only glimpse we can have of this man's vision, his art and his love.  This album would easily fit into my top 3 list of most important of all time.  I heard a record exec mention in an interview that Jeff's label had the general idea that it would have gone &quot;Dylan, Springsteen, Buckley&quot;...Jimmy page referred to him as &quot;the most incredible singer in the last 20 years&quot; and was actually in awe of his guitar abilities.  Please give this album a chance, maybe you won't like it, but if nothing else it deserves a chance.
B00004NJJQ|5.0|1977. Rainbow Music Hall in Denver. <BR>Maybe 2500 people at the show. I was in the Air Force stationed at Lowery and I dragged a friend of mine to the show. <BR>I had read about the album in Rolling Stone (back when it was actually relevant kids) and they raved about it, so I bought that vinyl. <BR>The band came out at about 9:30pm and played for two hours. <BR>Then came FOUR encores ending with the classic \\"Rock Bottom\\" <BR>I can still close my eyes and hear the thundering ending of that song. <BR>My friend talked about it for a week. <BR>They tore it up. <BR>It was the loudest concert I've ever been to, and I've seen them all. <BR>A thousand concerts, and I have yet to see it's equal. <BR>UFO. <BR>What a great name for a band.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This movie is so bad it deserves to be smashed over and over again. Probably the wachowskys dont understand that the fans expected more from this sequel because the original was very good. Instead, they decided to create a remake of the STAR WARS saga, except that this time occurs in the Matrix. Check this if you dont belive me : Luke Skywalker ( the New Hope as a Jedi ) is Neo, The Force are Neo's powers inside the Matrix, the Millenium Falcon is the Nebuchanasser( however it is spelled ), Princess Leia is Trinity, Han Solo is Morpheous, Darth Vader is Agent Smith, The Emperor is the Architect and so forth ...<BR>Not to mention that the movie lasted 2.5 hours just to find out that the Matrix is on its 6th version. Matrix 6.0 ??<BR>How about Matrix Advanced Server 2003 ??? Gimme a break !!!
B00007BK2N|4.0|I've read some bad reviews on here, but I enjoyed this film.  I'm certain that if you're even the least bit interested in where the rave scene started, you will enjoy this film.  It starts out in the late 70's with the inception of Factory Records and goes through the entire rise and then subsequent fall of the company.  With music from such bands as the Happy Mondays, Joy Division, New Order and even the Sex Pistols...all who were at least once released under the Facotry Records label.  Along the way are some great moments in music history that I'm sure many are totally unaware of, and perhaps many don't care to know of.  Regardless of that though this is an entertaining film.  The DVD looka great, and actually has a commentary track from the real Tony Wilson, the man behind it all.
0930289331|5.0|Here, you can see Batman like never before, a rookie making mistakes. I think this is the best Batman story, a great plot, a great art and GREAT caracthers, the relantionship between Gordon and Batman is excellent. My favorite comic book and I read a lot.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade is back, and he's more ticked than ever...seeing that he has to team up WITH vampires to fight off a mutant breed that's drinking the blood of both human's AND vampires.  Double up the action and the weapons, but take away the level of gore the first one had and you pretty much have Blade II figured out.  The DVD once again is sprawling and will eat up whatever time you give to it.  A must have if you already own the first one.  Those who aren't familiar might want to check out Blade first, and go from there.
B00006JI8V|5.0|If you are a fan of Stratovarius and you are looking for something fresh, this would be a good album to get. While at times they do sound like Stratovarius, and the band seems to talk about them a lot, they are in no way a clone of them. The first three tracks are awesome and the song Kingdom For A Heart is my favorite on the album. In short, if you are a fan of fast melodic power metal, don't miss out on this band, also their other two albums are also great.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth.<br />Blackwater Park is the second album I bought of Opeth.<BR>I first heard this group for 5 years ago, when the &quot;Still Life&quot; album was new. First song I heard was &quot;Serenity Painted Death&quot;. I was astonished. Theese guys does what other doesn't. You could describe they're music in many, many ways. But I have a, what I think, good definition. Opeth plays progressive music. No, not like Dream Theater, that's regressive metal. Thinking Dan Swanö? No, not really, that's more progressive metal. Opeth plays progressive music. They're not bounded to the metal genre as &quot;Metallica&quot; or whatever other group. So how does it sound? I would say: mix death metal, folklore, jazz and rock, then your halfway there. <br />Mikael Åkerfeldt, singer, guitarist and songwriter is brilliant. On the &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; album I'm most found of the track called &quot;Harvest&quot;, I belive, all tracks are great. &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; is probably the best album to buy with Opeth if you havn't heard them. Not saying it's easy music, but it is not as hardmolten as the newer &quot;Deliverance&quot; or &quot;Damnation&quot;. Not saying those are bad albums. I love all of Opeth except their first album where the production is lacking. Buy this album, it's worth the money!<br />I also recomend:<BR>All of Opeth - Best metal band around theese days<BR>All of Nightingale - Regressive metal at it's best<BR>Type O Negative - October rust - Best goth so far<BR>Tuborg Grön 3.5% - Ain't those too sweet?!?!
B00005YW4H|1.0|I found this CD to be ultra-boring....  Although Norah Jones' voice has been described as wonderful, I found it to be annoying -- she has no vocal range and she doesn't do much with what she has!!  There are many other singers that have wonderful voices and singing styles -- I wouldn't waste my time or money on this CD....
B0000BYM3K|3.0|It's true that choruses are repetitive in this CD (Montsegur, No More Lies, etc), but look back to some Maiden classics and you'll recall that they too had repetitious choruses (Die With Your Boots On, Flight Of Icarus, Back In The Village, Caught Somewhere In Time,... the list goes on).<br />The problem here is that this CD lacks good ideas (i.e. guitar riffs, catchy melodies), and the band tried to compensate this with orchestration and long songs with disconnected sections (\\"Dance Of Death\\" and \\"Paschendale\\" virtually stop for a new section/melody to be introduced, so songs aren't fluid at all...). \\"Montsegur\\" and \\"Wildest Dreams\\" stand out as songs where the sections (solo, post-solo breakdown or harmonies) are truly \\"connected\\" in the Maiden tradition.<br />The songs in DOD lack memorable guitar riffs, they're basically vocal melodies sung over powerchords. An example is \\"New Frontier\\" (which is actually one of the best songs, given the good drumming, good vocal melody, and interesting chord changes reminescent of \\"Gangland\\" and \\"Back In The Village\\").<br />The last 3 songs in the CD are simply horrible - period. I don't get this idea of \\"letting a song grow on you\\". The old Maiden albums never had to grow on me, nor did Brave New World - they just hit you in your face in the first listen. The last 3 songs in the CD will make you beg that they had made them shorter.<br />Maiden can use repetitive choruses (as they did in the past) and still create great songs, but in order to do that they need better musical ideas. I'd like to see them forget orchestration and write good raw-er songs (not as raw as in \\"St Anger\\", please) like those in \\"Accident Of Birth\\"... speaking of which, what a good idea it would be to kick off Janick and bring in Roy Z, if they want to have 3 guitars anyway.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This is perhaps the most puerile dribble I have ever heard. What it has is a seductive, strong drumbeat, hypnotically sucking the listener into a morass of silliness. Some of the lyrics are almost funny in their awkwardness, and verge on illiteracy.<br />\\"My friends say you're so into me<br />And that you need me desperately<br />They say you say we're so complete\\"<br />Worse yet is the cover of the Jagger/Richards \\"(I Can't Get no) Satisfaction,\\" which is full of vocalized wiggles and oooh ahhh uhhhs in a girlish whisper.<br /><br />Without the heavy percussion, and the electronic effects, one is left with practically a vacuum; one that has been polished, packaged, rehearsed, and sold as \\"music.\\"<br />There should be a new category for stuff like this. Maybe somewhere between \\"Books,\\" \\"Music,\\" and \\"Kitchen & Housewares,\\" we could have \\"Rubbish.\\"<br />The booklet insert has extensive recording info, some of the lyrics, and lots of \\"cute\\" photos. The sound is lavish, and the total time 44'35 minutes too long.
0316666343|5.0|From the first sentence in Chapter 1 to the last words on page 328, I was glued to this book. The whole story is being told to us by Susie Salmon; a fourteen-year old girl that was raped and murdered. When the story begins Susie is already in heaven. From there she watches her family, made up of her parents and younger sister and brother. She watches her friends go on with their lives. She also watches her killer get away with her murder. Throughout the book Susie describes what happens on earth as life continues wihout her and talks about her heaven. <BR>The great thing about this book is the chapters that keep you literally on the edge of your seat, Sebold did a fantasic job at keeping the reader's attention.<BR>The only negative thing I have to say about this book was the parts of the book that were hard to follow, and I also felt that Chapter 22 was not nessasary and went off of the storyline a little bit. I think this book probably is between four and five stars, but since I couldn't give it that rating I gave it five stars. Overall I felt that this was an excellent book and recommend it for everyone who loves to read.
B00005RHGK|1.0|The film starts out on a deserted highway, which should give you the clue that this is one of those horrors that intends to go nowhere, in no great hurry. The story (if you can call it that) centres around a brother and sister returning home when after they overtake a dusty old lorry, wait for it, awaken an ancient demon's reign of terror.<BR>      The movie has no fear factor, the supposed demon looks a cross between Victor Meldrew and Alf Garnett, (the latter's more scary) and the suspense is non-existent. Which is a shame because it is one of those hippy left-wing horrors that chooses to eschew horror for suspense. Director Victor Salva thinks all you have to do is crank the violins up and force eyedrops into his actors to sustain the horror induced wide-eyed look. How wrong he is. <BR>      Salva has conjectured a film of bluff. Just when you think the film is about to deliver the gruesome goods, it falls flat on its face. The siblings reach an old lady's large rundown house, and we can only see the back of her head. The viewer is anticipating that when she turns around, we'll be confronted with the apparition of a nasty gargoyle, but no such luck, it's just an old lady.<BR>      Without giving the ending away, you'd think its a given for the protagonists to win, expecially given the fact Salva has little left to play with other than a morality tale (having lost the signpost for horror a while back.) But Salva isn't one for convention. If you consider this a twist, you're either very undemanding, or your someone that having sat through its 86 mins (sounds short doesn't it) you cant believe how the most hyped horror film since A Nightmare On Elm Street is such a flop. I know I belong to the latter.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Well, first let me say....it's about time! I was beginning to believe that Sony was never going to re-release this masterpiece and now that its out on SACD I simply could not be happier.  <br />As far as the disc goes I doubt I could add anything new to the many reviews that have previously posted. \\" Blood On The Tracks \\" communicates more about love, loss, anger, abandonment and searching then any dozen other cd's that I could piece together. But...the wonderful aspect of Dylan's \\" Blood On The Tracks \\" is simply that by releasing a record that is so intensely personal and heartbreaking every fortunate listener will have his/her own unique understanding on what these beautiful lyrics truly mean to each of us. Speaking for myself these incredible tunes tend to wash over me and are, in some small way, truly cathartic. Many songs that we lovingly remember reach us in odd, numerous ways but \\" Blood.... \\" tends to gently sneak up on the listener and strangely become woven in the very fabric of our lives. Becoming a part of who we are and giving each listener a much deeper understanding of how these turbulent emotions have indeed affected our lives. And though for most us these feelings are intensly personal Dylan has offered us not only a better understanding of where they still lie in us but a true perspective as well. And how alive the hurt that he feels still lives in all of us. Ultimately, the songs to be found here may be Dylans painfully personal confessions but the emotions are universal.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Only a miracle could explain how Damien, Lisa Hannigan and Vivian on cello ever found each other. The beauty lies in the subtle shifts - a cello building steam in the background and then finally knocks your socks off. Lisa first singing softly in the background about to take over with a solo, Damien repeats a phrase and the last time 'round lets loose.<BR>What would inspire him to include an opera singer in Eskimo sending this tune to almost unbearable heights. A stunning CD.
B000001FS3|5.0|From the opening triumverate of number one songs all the way to the end few albums will match the lyrical content and musical craftsmanship of The Joshua Tree. &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; are a rare glimpse at an angry U2 not only in lyrics but in beat as well. People will say its austere but I feel that if you actually get beyond the superficial you will see it actually as a happy album. A look towards great things. &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; and &quot;In God's Country&quot; are very uplifting songs. U2 seems to have hit their peak here but the best is yet to come. A must have for any real rock fan.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|As others have indicated, the first time I listened to the album, I was not particularly moved or impressed.  But something in me knew that there was more to it.  So, I turned up the volume and listened to it several times throughout the day.  Well now I can't stop listening to it, and it will remain in my 3-disc changer for some time to come.<br />For me, many of the new rock and metal albums out there grow old very quickly (new Metallica, Korn, Godsmack).  Don't get me wrong, I like some of these albums, but there's just something about them that I get sick of after listening a few times.  When this happens, I get a feeling that I didn't get my moneys-worth.  Whereas some albums are quite the opposite (new Chevelle, Tool, Default, Revis).  These albums have lasting power for me, and when I'm not listening to them, I'm thinking about listening to them.  That speaks volumes.<br />I highly recommend that you buy Thirteenth Step if you feel the same way.
B000002NC4|5.0|I've already filled out a review, but this one is more divergent.  Deservedly this album attain a completely 5 star status.  I just want to say i recently saw Built to Spill for like the 7th time live, but this time they played 4 new songs!  ANd let me tell you; each of these songs reached if not surpassed the genius found in PFNO.  THeir last song lasted some 10 minutes and even went into a beautiful reggae sound!  Doug played the guitar as if he was the son of some great God.  Like his whole mission is soley to play it and change life on earth with his amazing transformations.  What is truely genius is his ability to change the tempo/scale/ and mood of the song without you even noticing till after it has happened.  I so hope that BTS puts out a new album full of actually new material (which Anicent melodies was NOT!)  and by the sound of their latest live show, it looks like that is going to happen!  &gt;&gt; and by the way, people here for a review of Perfect from Now On: it is an amazing album and should be in a hall of fame or somthing.
0385512104|5.0|Novels written from the perspective of a mentally disabled protagonist are a tricky business, they can easily veer into condescension, mawkishness, or quirkiness for its own sake. Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn is a recent excellent example of a highly entertaining book which avoids these pitfalls, and this story about a 15-year-old boy with a highly functional form of autism (Asperger's syndrome) is another. Christopher lives in Swindon (&quot;the armpit of England&quot;) with his widowed father, excels in math, can't read people's expressions, doesn't understand statements that aren't literal, and has severe color issues (for example, red foods are good, brown foods are not). The story begins when Christopher discovers his neighbor's dog dead, with a garden tool sticking out of it. Someone has clearly murdered the dog, and in the spirit of his favorite fictional character, Sherlock Holmes, he sets out to discover who the villain is. A social worker at his school helps him record his investigation in book form-thus explaining the novel. Christopher encounters inexplicable adult resistance to his desire to investigate, which by a quirk of fate, leads him to investigate his dead mother. At which point the book takes on a classic quest structure and the dead dog is left behind.<br />The real joy of the book is not its plot (which is skimpy and turns into a soap opera in the final third), but its nuanced portrait of the challenges faced by the mildly autistic, and by those who raise them. Christopher's sensitivity to noise, crowds, colors, and especially being touched, is shown in vivid detail (Some reviewers have criticized the character of Christopher as having many behavioral tics that would be cured in a few years therapy, however they seem to have missed the point that his father is a lower-middle class, blue-collar worker, and by inference could never hope to afford therapy.). At the same time there's no attempt to build Christopher into a figure of pity: he's clever, persistent, irritable, and sometimes irritating -a fully rounded character who simply operates in a slightly different world than most of us. The prose is very simple and direct, as one might expect from a young boy, making accessible to younger readers (although parents should be aware that there are four-letter words present). If for no other reason, the book is worth reading for the humanistic and empathetic portrayal of a mentally disabled youth, and will help any reader better understand the challenges facing those with mild autism.he's clever, persistent, irritable, and sometimes irritating -a fully rounded character who simply operates in a slightly different world than most of us.

B00005OAIE|4.0|I was at a music store looking for some jazz CD's when I heard a very familiar voice being played in the listening station of the music store. I thought it was the jazz singer Michael Franks. I was pleasantly surprised to note that it was John Mayer. Never heard him before. I bought the CD for a steal. Just 7 $. Sony CD's were on sale. Value for money. This CD is very impressive. John's vocals has a hint of jazz but it also combines the essential elements of rock, blues &amp; a hint of soul as well. The track Neon appealed to me the most. This guy's worth a listen most definately !
0316666343|1.0|Read this for a book club and absolutely hated it. The writing was awful, the characters unbelievable and I can't understand its popularity at all.
B00006F7S4|3.0|Comparing Beck to Dylan or some other 20th century artist is entirely fair. However to class him with Bach or Beethoven is completely out of place. Those musicians could write music from head to paper involving multiple instrument orchestras. It is like trying to compare poets and authors of classical Rome such as Virgil and Livy to authors or poets just after the fall of the Roman Empire in the dark ages after the invasions of the Huns, Goths and Vandals 400AD and beyond. Literature was virtually non-existant. There wasn't any. Similarly, there is NO classical music today which in its complexity and beauty will be remembered on a level such as Mozart's. We are in a dark ages of musical creativty - mostly due to the time, discipline, education and training (and the money therefore required) to produce such musical niveaus. This is in turn a matter of economics. The rich were not taxed higher than others as they are now. However I digress largely from the subject of rating Beck's album...and thus bid adieu..;)
B0000C8AUO|5.0|The limited edition includes 3 songs not on the normal release - FLY, QUEEN OF ALL THE TARTS, and REBEL REBEL.  Rebel Rebel is a totally new version, and it's pretty incredible.  Now for the CD ... This is brilliant!  &quot;NEW KILLER STAR&quot; starts the album with a big bang.  Bowie is hooky and edgey all at once!  Then he covers &quot;PABLO PICASSO&quot; which some may remember from the film REPO MAN.  The album continues in a very strong way, and I find it hard to describe.  BOWIE has always been about art rock, and combining many elements not unlike a painter who is using sound as his landscape.  He changes with every album, but at the core is a strong voice and an impeccable poet.  The last song on this outing is called BRING ME THE DISCO KING.  It's probably a dig at the music that became pop in the 70s that killed his own art rock/glam revolution.  This CD is produced along with long time collaborator Tony Visconti.  It combines jazz with techno - sort of TONIGHT meets EARTHLING if you can imagine.  You need this if you're a fan!  The most interesting release so far this year as far as I'm concerned.  Others can have their pop princess, but for me this year is all about Bowie.
B000059XY3|5.0|This is a great movie and is one of the best superhero movies EVER made.Val Kilmer,Chris O'Donnel,Tommy Lee Jones,and especially Jim Carrey are great in their roles and Nicole actually is pretty good in this as well!5 stars!
B0000AR8NK|5.0|REALITY is a great art album.  Bowie is a painter using sounds and textures, and he removes himself from genres.  Yes this CD ranges from techno, industrial and jazz - often in one song.  It's a complete statement, and a wholly satisfying journey.  Tony Visconti helps produce one of Bowie's best releases in this or any decade.  The whole affair begins strongly with NEW KILLER STAR - a rocking song with a hook.  Bowie covers &quot;PABLO PICASSO&quot; by Johnathan Ritchman which some may remember off the REPO MAN soundtrack.  It wanders in the same vein and winds up with an astro lounge ballad called BRING ME THE DISCO KING.  Is it a dig at 70s pop, or a paranoid vision of today?  Probably both.  This one seems less about his age, and more about the state of the world - an assault on consumerism (both his own and yours) can be found on TRY SOME, BUY SOME or SHE'LL DRIVE THE BIG CAR. NEVER GET OLD is more a statement that we will never have enough than railing against age.  The lyrics are pure poetry, and the music and singing is pure Bowie.  He's found new life lately, and he still intrigues and challenges his listeners after well over 3 decades.  It's a glittering gem of an album.  A well expressed work in a world that often gives us singles and sound bytes.  Bowie refuses to toss out just one or two hits.  This is solid from start to finish.  And his best since his last album!  :-)
B00000JGEI|5.0|James Cameron made this terific follow-up to The Terminator.T2 stars Arnold returning to his most popular role,this time as the good guy.His mission is to protect John Connor(Edward Furlong)from The T-1000(Robert Patrick),The most advanced terminator built.Linda Hamilton also returns as Sarah Connor,but is more tough than she was in the last one.The acting(except Furlong)is great,as are the visual effects.Great movie!Followed by a even better sequal:Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines!
B00005JLXE|4.0|To quote an unjust review &quot;Daredevil is not much of a superhero..then again, Ben Affleck is not much of an actor..!&quot; Daredevil is one of Marvel Comics mainstays in their stable of characters, but outside of the comicbook industry, is not that well known. About a boy who is blinded by an accident at childhood while doused with a radioactive isotope, then gaining super heightened senses and sensitivity.  He grows up to become a lawyer by day, and crimefighter by night. Daredevil has been called one of many &quot;a poor man's Batman&quot; .A nifty movie with high production values, DAREDEVIL succeeds on several levels and the Ben Affleck backlash is totally unfair.  Ben Affleck came to the San Diego ComicCon 2002 during post-production to talk about the film along with the director and producers. He was familiar with the character stating he read the work of comicbook innovator Frank Miller's (Batman/THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS) take/run (writing/art) on the DAREDEVIL character back in the 80's. So,it was nice to know that Affleck had familiarity and was not in the film for merely a paycheck. The only drawback of the film is that it suffers from the Batman Movie syndrome by putting too many characters (villians, support characters from the comic books etc) in the movie.  The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) was not fully developed as was the Elektra character (Jennifer Garner). Though, they were great on the screen. This left room to develop the Matt Murdoch character and Affleck is teriffic along with his relationship with his law partner Frankie&quot;Froggie&quot;Nelson (Jon Favreau). There is the Bullseye (the versatile and chameleon..Collin Farell, who seems to be in a movie being released every month) who comes out of the gates full throttle, and Joe Pantoliano as reporter Ben Ulrich. The plot of the film revolves around Daredevil wanting to rid the crime around New York City's &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; slum area and getting in the way of the Kingpin's plans for control of that part of the city. Daredevil/Matt meets Elektra along the way as her father works for the Kingpin.  Pretty basic stuff, but the film succeeds because it was pretty much faithful to the source material, the atmosphere was kept dark and moody (which is what Batman fans wanted, and didn't get in the dreadful BATMAN AND ROBIN), the casting was excellent, and the production values were first rate.for control of that part of the city.

B000059XXZ|4.0|Batman Forever is the best of the series,but this a really close second.Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton are great in this.Nicholson plays Joker to the the core(he was even nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance)and Keaton is great as Batman,athough I think Kilmer was better.Anyway,a great movie!Followed by one terrific sequal(Forever),one that is very underated(Batman and Robin),and one that is just plain awful(Returns,boy I HATE tht movie).
0671027344|5.0|This book is an excellent read and I've thought this much ever since I picked it up when I first saw it on the bookshelves in the library... I may not be able to do it justice by quoting the pages of text in a psuedo-intellectual form of making myself look important. All I will say is that it belongs on more high school reading lists for it to ever be taken seriously as an achievment in litterary power.
B000059XY5|1.0|Michael Keaton amazing performace,Catwoman and the visual effects are the only things that saves this monvie from being the WORST movie ever made!Danny Devito(boy he should had got that Razzie)and Christopher Walken are horrible!The story is so awful that a 5 year old could do a better job.This movie sucks compared to the other three(Batman and Robin is SO much better)and is so overrated.Avoid at all costs!
0385507755|1.0|i found the style of this book fragmentary and incoherant, not 'raw' as many of the reviews claim. I pined for complete sentences and more introspection from the narrator. Frey made good points about the ineffectivness of the assembly-line AA recovery system which i appreciated as a fellow recoveree (self determination is more effective than AA). Most points were lost in his adolescent ego. I tired of the defy-the-status-quo/system attitude. By the end, I didn't care whether the narrator remained sober or not. This book contributes little to the bloated glut of recovery memoirs.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|&quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is a definite progression from APC's first cd &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;. Where &quot;Mer&quot; was a touch agressive, &quot;Thirteenth&quot; is mellow and melodic. The new members of APC definitely have an effect on this cd, but not such a great one that fans should be worried about a large change in the music style. Fan's of APC's agressive style will find solace in songs like &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Gravity&quot;. However, those who were partial to songs like &quot;Orestes&quot;, and &quot;3 Libras&quot; from &quot;Mer&quot; will be impressed by &quot;A Stranger&quot;, &quot;Noose&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and basically the whole cd. On the whole, this is a great cd, and a must buy for all fans of APC and/or Tool.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I should add to inform those who don't know that the song &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a cover of a Failure song of the same title from the Fantastic Planet album.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|I know this is officially an EP and not a full length album, but anyone who remembers vinyl LP's and cassettes, knows that albums only had 10 songs on them. They weren't 17 tracks (half of which [were bad])  like most bloated CD's today. Just because the CD can hold more music, doesn't mean you should fill all that space up. <br />That being said, this album is more like the way the albums used to be: long enough; yet short enough and to the point. This record doesn't have the epic sweep of her last album, Mama's Gun, because it's a party album; a funk jam all the way through. She finds a way to keep the momentum going without it getting monotonous.  It's not her best album, but it's fun, short and enjoyable.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A Perfect Circle was a unique band on their first record, Mer De Noms, but now that primary songwriter Billy Howerdel had a couple of years just to sit and write, while Tool was on tour with Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of A Perfect Circle as well as Tool), this is a much more complete album.  Thirteenth Step shows a different side to the music of this band, a more mature side of them.  This is much more progressive than Mer De Noms, and on a first listen a person might be turned off to it.  This is rule number one with this ablum: Give it time.  After 2,3,4 listens this album will completely blow you away with its flow and connectivity.  The album is darker than Mer De noms, but not nearly as heavy, it has a contemplative feel to it.  It is good to see a band mature and progress in their art as A Perfect Circle certainly have.  If you are fan of good, challenging music, pick up this album and make sure to give it the time it deserves.<br />1) The Package:  The longest song on the album, it starts out quietly, with eery lyrics, but gets very hard towards the end, a very good build by the band, and a great opener to the album.<br />2) Weak and Powerless: The lead single, it feels somewhat out of place on the album, but if you pay attention to the lyrics it fits right in.  This is the most conventional song on the album.  Overall, a solid song.<br />3) The Noose:  My personal favorite song on the album, very powerful lyrics, another amazing build up by the band.  Maynard's voice sounds amazing on this song.<br />4) Blue: Another solid song, combined with The Noose and Vanishing, they make a solid triumvirate of songs.  The album gets a little heavier on this song.<br />5) Vanishing:  Starting out with faint voices coming from everywhere, this is a great song, so far above anything on Mer De Noms, A Perfect Circle take chances on this album and they all pay off, this song is a risky one, but it works.<br />6) A Stranger:  Acoustic guitar and another great performance by Maynard.  This is perhaps the most quiet song on the album.  This is my second favorite song behind The Noose.<br />7) The Outsider:  This is a pretty heavy song, it is also pretty solid.  The lyrics continue a pattern throughout the album, which you will have to hear for yourself, as I said this album has much to discover.<br />8) Crimes:  This is an odd segue track, with jsut drums, and Maynard counting to ten.  It does seperate the first 7 tracks from the last four.  There is a change in the tone fo the album after this.<br />9) The Nurse Who Loved Me:  This is a cover of the Failure song of the same title.  It has strings and just vocals.  Its an odd song on the album and the only one I have a complaint about, it does not seem to fit nearly as well as the rest of the album.  It would be a good song, on another album.<br />10) Pet:  This is the hardest song on the record, it is almost anthematic.  Such a great song, I think it would make a pretty popular single, its a great song to put near the end of the album.<br />11) Lullaby:  A segue track that has people saying &quot;go back to sleep&quot; repeatedly, it eases you into the final song.<br />12) Gravity:  A great final song to the record it really puts some closure on it.  A song about surrender.  It is somewhat quiet.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Although it does not match up the first album, it is very much individualistic (a word?). I was relived that they did not turn around and make another &quot;Mer De Nom&quot; and if you listen to the new album through a few times, you can see its potential. &quot;The Noose&quot; was the first song that really amazed me and although &quot;Pet&quot; sounded a little overdone, it was still well crafted. This album was worth buying.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It took a few times listening to the album before the album hit me.  The songs don't seem catchy at first, but after a few times listening to the album, you can feel yourself humming the tunes and singing along.  <br />WEAK AND POWERLESS is one of the catchy tunes, but certainly not the best of the album.<br />THE PACKAGE, THE NOOSE, and PET (as well as the rest of the album) are amazing songs.  Almost every song starts out slowly, almost w/ an intro.  Give the songs time to develop before you skip to the next track.<br />You have to be patient with this album.  If you buy it, give it time to grow on you.  <br />If you need catchy tunes and instant gratification, don't buy this album.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|INCREDIBLY ENHANCED! IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS, GO HANG YOURSELF FROM A TREE. IF YOU HAVE IT, PICK UP THE REMASTER!!!! HIS GREATEST EFFORT HAS A PRESENCE THAT WILL STOP YOU IN YOUR TRACKS.<BR>ANY QUESTIONS?
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great depiction of war. Straight forward, almost documentary. Far superior to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. But if &quot;...Ryan&quot; had 10 hours to tell its story it might have been this GOOD. Was surprised to see one of my new favorite actors, Neal McDonough. The series is not full of psycho B.S. It was a much needed piece of work, for us younger generation. That do not have a realistic grasp on war. Were many thousands die, not the small amount that have sacrificed their lives in the last 12 years.
B0000C23DO|4.0|.... for those of you, who, like myself, never got the point of unfocused and undisciplined noodling for hours until the marijuana wears off. I suppose if you were a Deadhead you could quibble about a song or two, but I happened to have thought they were an OK band whose individuals tended to be greater than the sum of their parts. Kinda fitting for the Dead. All the same, this has a lot of really terrific songs that show just how well this band could tap into something quintessentially American and make it danceable.<BR>The remastering on this disc brings out the subtle joys of &quot;Uncle John's Band&quot;, &quot;Box of Rain,&quot; &quot;Friend of the Devil.&quot; &quot;Eminent Prophet&quot; and &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot; sound terrific, &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; however seems to have had a bad job done on it as the vocals seems quite muddy. This is an exercise in restraint, and so tends to show what the band could really do when focused. For those who feel that any of their tunes only got their mojo going when extended for 20 minutes, there are plenty of official bootlegs to satisfy that jones. Most of the rest of the tunes here never grabbed me, well maybe, &quot;Ripple,&quot; and it's interesting what a marked departure Mickey Hart's presence on the drummer's chair meant for the band.
0316096199|5.0|I give Alice Sebold high marks for taking a memoir of personal tragedy and turning it into an unforgetable and dare I say,  entertaining read.  The subject matter is brutal (a violent rape),and her family rife with dysfunction (Dad is distant and cold, Mom is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and Sis is overachieving and lonley).  Alice is the glue that binds this fragile family together, and her rape and it's aftermath brings out the best and worst in those around her.  This is a well written, page turner of a book that I would recommend highly.  If you enjoyed Alice Sebold's novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\", I can guarantee you will not be disappointed with this effort.
0385504209|3.0|I like to work logic puzzles and I love a good plot-filled mystery with lots of surprises, and this one had them in abundance.  And the city of Paris in general and the Louvre museum in particular are made to order for heart-pounding thrillers, and this book is no exception.  The symbolism is wildly fascinating,the characterizations are good, the pace is fast, and the twists and turns of the plot kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />However, I had two problems with the book -- or maybe I can say ONE objection with two aspects, and each objection cost it one star in my evaluation.<br />1.  There are a lot of historical &quot;facts&quot; given here that challenge the teachings of Orthodox Christianity (both Catholic and Protestant).  I won't go into detail about them here, but I'll say this:  I wish the author had given some good, solid sources so that we, the readers, could have checked on the sources ourselves.  One of the characters in the story states that many &quot;respected&quot; historian-scholars could corroborate the view about the &quot;real&quot; meaning of the Holy Grail and the &quot;real&quot; history of Christ.  I would have liked to know who they were.  I also would like to have known if the story's take on the life of Christ, the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail legend was an honest-to-goodness historical view or one invented by the author for the story's purpose.<br />2.  I also felt like the author was &quot;blaming&quot; Christianity for the bad treatment of women.  Maybe he wasn't, and I misunderstood him.  But I feel it is important to mention that the church did not invent the bad treatment of women.  This is important to know, because while the church(both Catholic and Protestant) has left a lot to be desired in its treatment of women, the view of women as inferiors (which is unBiblical, by the way) was in existence long before the church ever came into being.<br />Anyone who has studied Western Civilization and/or Far Eastern history will know that ancient cultures, many of whom had a plethora of female deities, still treated their women like dirt.  The ancient Greeks held women in contempt -- just read Aristotle, who lived before Christ. Ancient and not-so-ancient India and China have historically mopped up the floor with women, female deities in their culture notwithstanding.<br />I know what an extreme patriarchal mindset some churches have -- as a woman I have been on the receiving end of it.  But let's not blame Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular for causing it.  Misogyny is extremely ancient!<br />The book is worth reading, but before taking any of its claims as truly historical, it behooves us all to check out our facts!know that ancient cultures, many of whom had a plethora of female deities, still treated their women like dirt.

B00003CXPJ|1.0|I bought the movie based on Stillers other work - what a joke!  That was the worst twenty bucks I have spent in several years.  If you rent or buy this movie, make sure you have enough booze to get lit prior to putting it on...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Why are so many people giving negative reviews to this album? It was fantastic in my opinion. The first song 'The Package' is kind of like a Tool song to me, and the followers are superb. 'Crimes' is a great instrumental song and 'The Nurse Who Loved Me' is a sheerly great song with MJK's beautiful vocals. 'Lullaby' is a short song with Opera-like music which is very soothing. 'Gravity' is a great end song, which leaves a very good opening for their next album. Overall, I recommend this album to Perfect Circle fans. 'Thirteenth Step' follows 'Mer De Noms' very well in its tracks.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|!BUY THIS! Don't steal from the musicians online.<br />The album is great and it only gets better, but being an avid Failure fan the cover of &quot;The Nurse who Loved Me&quot; is a bit sad.  I was so excited when I heard they were going to cover it because of my expectations for Maynard's passionate rendition. The original is better and more emotional. I love the music on the track, but Maynard doesn't live up to his standard emotional bombardment here.<br />Also, Maynard's void is much more natural and exposed than I have heard it in the past(a good thing).  The lyrics seem a bit less poetic than standard Maynard, but they are still good.<br />I found the music to be at moments both MUCH SOFTER and MUCH HARDER than the last album: a right and left brain experience. It again very much reminds me of Failure. If you like APC buy &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; by Failure (it has the original &quot;The Nurse who Loved Me&quot;).
B0000A36J5|5.0|Once in awhile, you see a movie that just absolutely blows you away.  It carries you away emotionally as you get involved in the story, and it also astounds you for the achievement in moviemaking that it is.<br />THE TWO TOWERS does this perhaps better than any film I've seen.  It's not the best acted movie in history (Liv Tyler is a bit one note, Miranda Otto a bit bland), but from a technical standpoint, I'm not sure you'll find a better film.  Just the achievement of Gollum alone is astounding.  I saw (to my chagrin) THE HULK, and there's a great example of how a digital creature doesn't work.  Or the three-headed dog in the first Harry Potter movie.  Or even the Cave Troll in the first LOTR.  You may suspend your disbelief, but in the back of your mind, you know the creature is computer generated.  Gollum just can't be fake...can he?  After about two minutes on screen, you totally forget he's a computer fabrication.  And when he has his \\"close-up\\" scene, when he argues with himself, the performance is amazingly convincing. Gollum is breath-taking.<br />And the Battle of Helm's Deep.  Wow!!  Not sure there's anything else to say.  It's on a par with the Chariot Race in BEN-HUR as a classic of excitement and craft.  <br />But the story itself is told with such obvious loving care that we become emotionally wrapped up in the story.  It has a grand sweep to it, sure, but it feels personal too.  Peter Jackson is to be highly, highly commended.  And surely, when RETURN OF THE KING is released, he will finally get the Oscar he deserves.  <br />The DVD's are astounding too.  The Deluxe DVD set for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING with all the restored scenes and documentaries is the greatest DVD in my collection, and I have hundreds of films.  It totally and completely lives up to the promise of the DVD format.  Why don't more films restore their deleted scenes back into the movie instead of having you watch them out of context later.  Perhaps it's because those scenes actually deserved to be deleted???  In LOTR, the restored scenes simply added depth, character development and MAJESTY to the epic film.  These are must-have DVDs.  I have seldom been so enthralled with a motion picture.  I just can't imagine how anyone can give this film less than 5 stars.<br />NOTE:  I'm not a Tolkien fan.  I can't get through the books.  I don't even know how the story turns out.  But from what I gather from talking to fans of the books, reading online and such, the changes Jackson made to the story are all justified from a cinematic story-telling sense.  <br />PS: The shot of Orlando Bloom flipping himself onto his running horse...that's probably worth the price of admission right there!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD is by far one of the best I have heard.  Maynard and the others really outdid themselves again.  This CD is very powerful and has a lot of deep sound throughout.  If you like Tool and you like Perfect Circle's first album, Mer De Noms, then you will definitely love this one.  Maynard is once again a pivotal voice in a indistinguishable industry.  With all of the new bands that appear today it is nice to hear a familiar voice.  Keep it up Maynard.  Everyone else, buy this CD!
B00000I8BX|5.0|Many people expected big things of Fear Factory after the release of DEMANUFACTURE, possibly one of the best metal releases of the decade.<br />What was delivered on OBSOLETE, was a complex, cross-genre album,not as accessible as their previous disc.<br />Again produced by Rhys Fulber of FrontLine Assembly fame, OBSOLETE revolves around a loose concept of a bleak future, stripped of the eccentricities of human nature. Common ground for these guys, but this is the album where their world view (musically at least) is at it's most cohesive. This is doubly true for the lyrics.<br />The production of Fulber, combined with the percussive playing of Raymond, Christian, and Dino lend themselves to an industrial feel that most metal bands would not be able to replicate. Burton's nihilistic lyrics prove that he as at the forefront of metal songwriting today. [heck!] Why couldn't I have thought of that!<br />A possible reason that this album was not received as well as it deserved to be was that fact that it spanned a range of musical sub-genres. Aside from the huge old schoool FF riffs, OBSOLETE delivered a more raw sound not quite as synth driven as their previous effort, whilst maintaing a highly rythym driven approach. This style has incorrectly been labelled as nu-metalism, if labels need to be applied, possibly something along the lines of idustrial death metal is almost appropriate. Certainly the impact of technology is ever present in their music, a touch ironic given the albums subject matter.<br />Standout tracks: Edgecrusher - the most power hungry metal track of the last five years, Securitron - \\"I am the way, prepare for salvation!! -brilliant- , Freedom or fire -haunting and brutal. Resurrection - anthemic and beautiful.<br />This release also features a cover of the retro dance classic Cars by Gary Numan, a well done effort which includes the man himself on vox as well.<br />If you have the spare [money amount]in your wallet, do yourself a favour and bypass themovies or a big mac for a change, get this CD.
0446605409|4.0|Well-executed, Interesting - but not Outstanding<br />Having thoroughly enjoyed DeMille's _Lion's Game_, what better book to read than to catch up on the prequel?  _Plum Island_ begins with Detective John Corey's recuperation (wounded in the line of duty) at his Uncle's home on picturesque Long Island.  Within moments, his friend - the local police chief - has presented him with an opportunity to view a crime scene.  Two neighbors - husband and wife - have been shot at their nearby home.  Interestingly, the couple both happened to have been employed by the U.S. Agriculture Department's Plum Island facility, specializing in animal-borne infectious diseases.<br />Given the nature of the work - and its applicability to bio-terrorism - CIA and FBI officials start showing up.  The small-town police chief needs a competent detective to help determine what's happened.  Thus, the visit to Corey's house.  Before long, Corey is swept into a mystery of intriguing proportions:  were the victims attempting to sell the tools for bio-warfare and double-crossed... or something else entirely?  While Corey is unable to work effectively with the government investigators -given his unoffical stature and lack of security credentials - he stumbles on a plausible, quite interesting, and perhaps fatal (for him) - reason for the crime.<br />It took me several attempts to grind through the first 70 pages... while not initially as engaging as its successor, once it did grab me, it was pretty darn good.  DeMille can, and mostly has, written more compelling material, but even at four stars, it's well beyond what most other authors can ever hope to accomplish.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Many others have written excellent reviews of this disc. I want to add that I am most impressed that Neil has made this release a two disc, music cd/video dvd for the usual price of a music cd.<BR>One compliments the other.  This is the way to do it today. Very hip, very 21st century.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|dont expect a direct sequel in thirteenth step.  as music fans, all of us should know better than to expect the same exact thing every album.  the vaguely tool-esque &quot;the package&quot; and the quasi-Chancellor bass lead into &quot;weak and powerless&quot; are good, but no indication of where this album goes.  &quot;the noose&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, and &quot;a stranger&quot; are all songs which, more or less, come from left field, especially if you thought you get the full 360 degrees of a perfect circle on mer de noms.  its obvious that billy howerdel and maynard each have many more influences to exercise over the course of the career of a perfect circle.  many reviewers are complaining about the failure cover &quot;the nurse who loved me&quot;.  its my advice to take that cover with a few grains of salt because it seems to me that they were trying to perform an almost mocking version of the original, whose lyrics border upon the inane occasionally.  but you can tell by the lyrics that this song was always meant to be taken lightly, theyre just going a bit over the top with the strings and such.  my main issue is with the segue tracks &quot;crimes&quot; and &quot;lullaby&quot;.  the former seems to be a sincere attempt at a dark bridge from song to song, while the other seems to be a bit of a goof.  my last note will be a bit of praise to the artist formerly known as twiggy.  mr. white's bass is much more of a focal point than paz's one, and i think it compliments the music well.  P.S.  heed the words of all the other reviewers, listen to this 3 or 4 times before you pass judgement, it grows on you with repeated listens... just like the last one.
B00005JLWN|5.0|My nephew brought the DVD to my house one day. It was recommended to him on the grounds of &quot;People who liked That, also liked This.&quot; As he described it I was reminded of a book I had read years ago, &quot;This Perfect Day&quot;, by Ira Levin, the author of Rosemary's Baby, the premise being a world that controls its human emotions is a world of peace.<BR>So we gave it a shot and I am not kidding, it is my new favorite movie. We watched it again so we could &quot;look at it&quot; on the second go-around. If you appreciate camera work, editing, lighting, set design, costuming, and all that cinema stuff, you know what I mean by &quot;look at&quot; vs &quot;watch.&quot; <BR>Other reviewers have made comparisons to The Matrix and rightly so, but Equilibrium is in its own way better because of its use of classical cinemagraphic techniques, not to mention the superb acting. The special effects never got too bossy. The action scenes are as original as I have seen, with a minimum of &quot;Yeah-right, I'm just sure, (yawn).&quot; and a maximum of &quot;How cool was that!&quot; <BR>I'm nearly fifty years old and I have seen plenty of guys running with two machine guns, doing horizonal leaps into doors and through windows, and I've seen hours of swordplay...but until Equilibrium I had never seen swordplay with handguns. The last time I saw moves so original was &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; with Geena Davis. Equilibrium's Grammaton Cleric reloads his weapons with even more panache than Lara Croft. And speaking of Christian Bale, he creeped me out in American Psycho, but has redeemed himself with Equilibrium. Henceforth, I'll watch anything he is in...no questions asked.<BR>I have one word of advice for the producers of this film...sequel. Gotta run, gonna go buy it now.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Before buying this album, there are two things worth noting. First, this album sounds in NO way anything like Mer De Noms. Second, listen to this album at least three times. The first time is needed just to get use to the fact that it's completely different from the previous album. It will grow on you by the second and third time.<br />Having said that, I felt that this was a very good and beautiful album. It is very layered, atmospheric, and sounding nothing like anything out there. My only complaints (which led me to give it 4 out of 5) were that it needes a couple of heavier songs and I didn't care for a couple of tracks. However, these are personal preferences. I highly recommend that everyone buy this album
B00008DDHZ|5.0|i had to have a friend in Armagh Northern Ireland record a copy of this for me, send it, and go through a $60.00 hassle having a UK tape converted so i could see a grainy copy of this movie!! i was never sure it would reach American shores!! glad to see it has come to us here in the USA. this movie was done by a Brit filming company and i am glad to see it portrayed in the light as it took place!! it is HIGHLY recommended by me if youre a historian, or just want to know what happened in Derry of 1969!! over 800 yrs of many and my ancestors plight under Brit occupation!!! its a must see, well done movie!!! cheers!!!! it will open the eyes of those who dont know and bring possibly a teary eyed memories for those who do know or were there!? you will not be sorry for a good night watching this movie! the actors in it are class as well!!<BR>Tiocfaidh Ar La!!!
B00005JLXE|5.0|The Daredevil DVD has lots of cool special features (2 disks worth!), and is a good movie too.<br />Fans of the comic won't be let down, and people who liked Batman should probably like Daredevil. It's a darker movie than Spider-Man, but is still very good.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Actually, I'm not much of a Tool fan (they got a unique sound I'm personally not very use to), so I had some skepticism when I bought it (I mostly bought it for James Iha, being a Pumpkin fan), but I did enjoy their single, &quot;Weak and Powerless.&quot; <br />I must say I was very surprised and pleased. There are some Tool influences in here, which is cool, but I found it cleaner and easier to listen to as well. I'm just slightly annoyed with the tracks that are just mostly instrumentation ... something Tool does alot too, but oh well. <br />Personally, I don't understand what's so special about &quot;The Noose&quot; and their version of &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me.&quot; They're nowhere near bad, but I didn't find 'em as strong highlights as other tracks. <BR>My personal alltime favorite of the album is &quot;Blue&quot;... it has such a powerful mood and beautiful sound to it, that it's quite... ethereal and haunting, I say. <BR>Other very strong highlights are &quot;Weak &amp; Powerless&quot;, and &quot;Pet.&quot;

0739302043|2.0|I listened to this book on CD because so many friends recommended the book. I'm not a mystery reader but thought I'd give it a try. Why all the hype? The book includes one tired clich&eacute; after another (His blood ran cold. No wait! Now his blood is boiling!). And somehow at just the right time the main characters stumble across exactly what they need to advance their investigation.<br />And the audio recording? Egad. The reader outdoes Inspector Clouseau with the phony French accent, but this isn't supposed to be funny.<br />My advice: Skip it.
B000002LGQ|5.0|In March of 1989, Madonna released her fifth album entitled, LIKE A PRAYER. This album is the album that made Madonna an official sex symbol, as well as really directing her to her way of becoming a huge icon. This album has been chosen as a favorite amongst many of her adoring fans across the world. I am one of those fans, who heavily favors this amazing album.     LIKE A PRAYER   The album's first single. What an awesome song. This song still rocks after all these years. I can never get tired of this song.     EXPRESS YOURSELF   The album's second single. This song became a anthem for many women, in being able to stand up for themselves. Another awesome song that only Madonna could do.    LOVE SONG  ...  performed by Madonna & Prince  I used to really hate this song, but the song has finally grown on me, as I recently became a fan of Prince.    TILL DEATH DO US PART   Another great song.    PROMISE TO TRY   This beautifully heartfelt, and at times, sad, ballad is about how Madonna felt about her mother's untimely death. Beautiful song.    CHERISH   The album's third single. Another great song.      DEAR JESSIE   The album's fifth single ... released outside of the U.S. This is such a great fairytale-esque song.    OH FATHER   The album's fourth single. A beautiful song describing what Madonna's father had sort of become after the death of her mother.    KEEP IT TOGETHER   The album's sixth & final single. A great dance track that describes the importance of your family and where you originally came from.    SPANISH EYES   Yet another beautiful Spanish-influenced ballad.    ACT OF CONTRITION   This track is actually sort of funny.     This album is just another prime example of how incredible talented Madonna really and truly is. Every song on here is just simply amazing. Madonna will always be the one and only true Queen.
B0000C23DO|3.0|I do not own and do not plan to own this cd. I am sick and tired of key tracks being left off of greatest hits cd's. Every time I would listen to this if I owned it I would wonder where Alabama Get Away was. It would irritate me each time so I will not buy it.
1853268968|5.0|I thought this is not complete Sherlock Holmes.  I was wrong!!  It has not only All 58 Strand Magazine version stories fully illustrated but also Two non-Strand Novels (non illustrated).<br />  So, This is The MOST Economical Complete Sherlock Holmes Fully Illustrated!!!<br />  Even if you have another version already, Must have this too!!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|It took awhile for this album to grow on me.  When I first heard it, I was extremely disappointed, but I listened to it a few more times in a row, and I now love it.<BR>Generally, it's more mellow and quiet than Mer De Noms.  <BR>Much of it sounds Toolish (more specifically, Lateralus)- in particular, &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;Vanishing&quot;, &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;.  Very slow and soft... there are several points at which there is little singing.<BR>&quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, &quot;A Stranger&quot;, &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, and &quot;Pet&quot; are somewhat more reminiscent of Mer De Noms.  <BR>&quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is an interesting song... sounding nothing like the rest of the album, being that it's a cover.  Still, it's worth listening to.  <BR>Don't buy this expecting another Mer De Noms, or you'll probably be disappointed.  It's very different, but it's still an impressive work in its own right.  I definitely recommend listening to most of it before buying (and listening to it several times).  It may disappoint you, or it may amaze you.
B000083E79|5.0|If you are a fan of Cher, then you will love this CD. It's got all her best hits, old and new. My 2 year old daughter even loves to sing along to The Beat Goes On. You won't regret buying this CD!!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Well it isnt really what I was hoping for.  Only 3 tracks with \\"meaty\\" guitar work.  Track 12 is a complete joke, why even bother putting that crap on there?  If there was just a hint of heavier guitars I would of given this 4 stars. No way in hell is this a 5 star album. But I am pretty strict in my grading. Like someone else mentioned it's a good buy if you can get it this week while its on sale ( I got mine $$$$ at .... Please dont spend $$$ at the mall for this (not worth it). Or just wait and buy a used copy because there will be plenty of people who will be dissapointed in this.  Perhaps it will grow on me but at first listening not one song really grabbed me. But hey, lets be real about one thing.  This still blows any of that nu-metal radio rock away. But I am just one man with one opinion. So if you want it buy it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CDs definitely by far different than Mer De Noms.  There are some obvious quick filler tracks with a Tool like sound.  The album has some very memorable tracks in this order: Track 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12.  If you want to relax and let your mind wander elsewhere with Perfect Circle, you can appreciate this album.  Listen to the lyrical content as well, this opens the road to understanding.  Overall, worth the buy, worth having in anyone's collection.
B00004S367|5.0|If you were around in 1971 and had been used to Stevie's 60's sound, this album would have blown you away! After a decade of having to deal with papa Berry's rules of album recording (3 pop hits and the rest filler), Stevie turns 21, goes off to record this classic, and goes back to Berry to say, \\"I want full control over my music or else!!\\" Of course papa Berry gave him that freedom and the rest is American music history. On the album, he plays every instrament. As always, I'll take the album song by song.<BR>I Say It 'Cause I Love Having You Around: A classic. A precursor to George Clinton's sound in the 70's, this song is actually a jump for joy. Sprinkled with joyous shouts and yelps, it's a very funky, synth driven romp. Stevie sings in his regular voice and his Louis Armstrong growl in this one. It's a fun song that shouldn't be taken seriously at all. Just enjoy the music and the fun and have some fun. One of the best album openers of his illustrious career. Superwoman: Another classic. This is a look into the future for Stevie. It was also a look more in depth into his relationship with his then wife Syreeta. Syreeta was a singer too and sometimes her career interfered with his. Or, more to the point, she wasn't around when he needed her. Stevie has been known to be somewhat of a male chauvinist in the past. And the title of this song kind of brings this out. He's basically saying that Syreeta should be home for him, \\"And all the things she wants to do she needs to leave behind\\". He ends each phrase by saying, \\"But, very well. I believe I know you very well. Wish that you knew me too very well. I and think I can deal with everything going through your head. The first part of the song is in mid-tempo then there is a musical interlude done on the synth to slow things down. The second part of the song is in a slower tempo and stripped down to just synth, drums and voice. There's a guitar solo by Jeff Beck in the mid section of the second part of the song that lifts it to another level. Overall it's a beautiful song that should not be missed. I Love Every Little Thing About You: An upbeat song basically singing about what the title suggest. I've always felt that this was his nod to the earlier work he'd done at Motown, only with a more 70's sound to it. Sweet Little Girl: Another fun song with Stevie doing a lot of things musically to make it interesting. He does his best mack daddy voice in this one, uses major and minor keys throughout, and does things on the harmonica that you've never heard before. It's probably the most erotic song he's ever done. All in good taste though, no hardcore stuff for Stevie. Happier Than The Morning Sun: Another major change musically for Stevie. This is all clavinet and voice. A beautiful, quiet and yet great song. Girl Blue: The best song on the album. This is Stevie's first collabaration with lyricist Yvonne Wright (not his ex wife Syreeta as many believe when seeing Wonder/Wright as song writers) and happily it wasn't his last. This is one of my 4 how-to-learn-about-music songs I've spoken about in the past. Ironicly, Yvonne wrote the lyrics for another one of my \\"how-to\\" songs from Stevie, They Won't Go When I Go\\". Much is abound in this one. Oriental percussion, poly-rhythms, distorted vocals, a great harmonica solo and great lyrics. \\"Little girl be fair, show yourself you care. Let others care for you. Before it's too late 'cause time won't wait 'til your hearts no longer blue\\". A great song and a great moment for pure music. Seems So Long: A heartwrenching song about finding someone, finally, to love. \\"It's been so long, since I've touched a wanting hand\\". It includes a great vocal by Stevie and some very moody synth work too. A must hear. Keep On Runnin': My least favorite song on the album. Ok, to be honest, I skip it all the time. It's too repetitive. He does play a mean clavinet on it though. Evil: My second favorite song on this one. Musically, he's using key changes to, I feel, relay a message. The song starts off in a minor, very dangerous sounding key and after each line, it goes up a key. It talks about evil and the power it seemingly has over many people. The final key the song ends on is very high as it ends with Stevie singing, \\"Leaving sweet love all alone, an outcast of the world\\", with the last note on the word world. The song is very cinematic, also operatic in style and leaves me with the feeling of hope. It is Stevie after all you know. <BR>All in all, this was the beginning. The beginning of an unprecedented run of success, both commercially and critically for the one man band. It is an album that should not be missed.
B0000047CX|5.0|The 1964 winner for Best Album was this mellow but spright cool jazz album that pushed Latin bossa nova and samba rhythms on the map.  With a lineup that included Joao Gilberto on guitar and vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano, Tommy Williams on bass, Milton Banana on drums, and on the two most memorable songs, Joao's wife Astrud.  However, the driving force behind this was tenor saxophonist Stan Getz, and his straight-tone, controlled-vibrato sound.<br />The album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song, \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\".  This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese.  Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics:  \\"Tall and tan and young and lonely/The girl from Ipanema goes walking/And when she passes/Each one she passes goes haaa.\\"  Well, the thing that makes me go \\"haaa\\" here is Astrud Gilberto's voice.  Getz's sax solo and Jobim's piano in the middle serves as a bridge between the two refrains.  There is a 45 rpm version of this classic, the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing, included later.  I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song, Bob River's \\"The Girl With Emphysema\\", and then sought hard to find out the original version, which led me to this album.<br />\\"Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)\\" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto.  In the full 4:14 version, we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics, as he did in the full version of \\"Ipanema.\\"  There is a dreamy quality about this song, particularly when Astrud sings \\"Quiet nights and quiet dreams/Quiet walks by quiet streams/And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely.\\"  And Getz's sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim's piano.  BTW, Corcovado is the name of a mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.  There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well.<br />As for the rest of the songs, Getz's rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner, particularly his solo on \\"So Danso Samba\\" with its \\"vai vai vai vai vai\\" refrain by Joao Gilberto.  The song title means \\"I Only Dance Samba\\", as opposed to calypso, the twist, and the cha-cha that were sweeping the country's dance floors in the 1960's.  And Joao Gilberto's soft vocals complement the soft qualities of the other instrumentalists.  Only complaint:  Astrud should've been featured on more songs.solo on \\"So Danso Samba\\" with its \\"vai vai vai vai vai\\" refrain by Joao Gilberto.

B00004SZWD|5.0|What can I say about Songs that has not been said before? Probably not much but I'll try my best. I've always said that I feel Innervision is Stevie's best work. Mainly because I feel that it had great, pure song writing on it, whereas on Songs, Stevie sometimes overindulges. I guess you can look at it this way: Innervisions is Stevie Wonder's personal best but Songs is the most important Stevie Wonder album ever in regards to music history. What makes Songs so incredibly important to music history is that it is done in an epic fashion. It's all encompassing musically and themewise. Stevie is all over the place in this one. No artist before had dived so deeply into his music before. It's been described as a Noah's ark-tpye of event because Stevie, known by this time as the one man band, brings just about all his family, friends and relatives to help him out on this one. Because the album is so mammoth in size (2 full albums plus an extra 45 with 2 songs on each side), there is no way I can do my usual song by song review in 1000 words or less. I will mention the stand outs though.<BR>Loves In Need of Love Today: Probably the best opener of any Stevie album. A great introduction to what follows on this amazing disc. Have a Talk With God: One of the best spiritual songs of his career. He weaves syncopated rhythms and synth together to make a great sound. Village Ghetto Land: Stevie sarcastically uses strings to talk about the horrors of the ghetto. Some lines are absurd but they are to make a point. What's going on in the ghetto, or any slum, is absurd and needs to be dealt with. Sir Duke: His salute to the jazz greats of the past. I Wish: A classic. Stevie's amazing keyboards, electric horns and snappy drums mix to make a delicious noise in this song about childhood misbehaving. There is no way to listen to this song and not remember when you were a kid. Again, a classic. Pasttime Paradise: Synth strings, Hari Krishna rhythm and vocals and a full gospel chior melt together in this great peice of songwriting. The melody was used in Coolio's Gangster's Paradise. Another classic. Isn't She Lovely: Is there anyone that didn't think of this song when either seeing their child being born or holding it for the first time? I didn't think so. This one sports a great melody, some of the best ever singing by Stevie, and for sure some of the best ever harmonica work by him. It's a song filled with joy and wonderment and a fitting salute to parenthood. I Am Singing: This song is sung in Swahili, Spanish and English. Again this is a global epic. Stevie puts on a show in the vocal here and the percussion is latin in feel. A beautiful song. If It's Magic: Another classic. How many can you fit on one album Stevie? It's harp, voice and harmonica melding into one of the softest, yet most powerful callings for love and peace ever written. As: I've always considered this song the most cosmic love song of all time. It's easily one of the stand outs on the incredible disc. It last almost 8 minutes in length and starts off as what we think will be just another nice mid-tempo love song by Stevie. Maybe like Knocks Me Off My Feet heard earlier on this same album. It is anything but. Generally speaking you can say it's a song where he's professing his undying love to his woman. But with keyboards by Stevie and Greg Phillinganes, an interlude by Stevie doing his best Louis Armstrong growl ever, and background vocals by just about everyone under the sun including Stevie's woman at the time Yolanda Simmons and his sister Renee Hardaway, this is a small ark inside of the bigger one which is the album itself. It's a song that is irrisistable to not absolutely love because of so much love coming out of it. And it is hands down the best use of repetivity used by not only Stevie but by any other popular artist ever. A must hear. Ebony Eyes: Another tribute to the black woman from Stevie. He'd done this earlier in Innervisions with Golden Lady. Although Golden Lady was more romantic, I prefer the more fun loving Ebony Eyes. It starts with the sounds of young black girls playing jump rope which melts into a very tin pan alley sounding piano part. It's a fun song and the only thing serious in it is Stevie's love of black women. Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call): For so many years I'd wanted to hear a Stevie harmonica instramental and in this song I finally get it. As the title says, it's an easy goin' track that consist of harmonica, bass and drum only. It's like a quiet summer night on the front porch of your mom's house. And, after the amazing ark before it, it is the perfect close to the album.<BR>Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key Of Life is a masterpiece not despite it's overindulgences but because of them. The chances he took and the all emcompassing vision he saw on this album opened the door for so many other artist (see Outkast's new disk Speakerboxx/Love Below) to take those same chances and see the same visions. And with some of our better artist, maybe even go beyond. It was the first of it's kind and still the best. BUY THIS CD. You will own a piece of history.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album has a few songs that ring in the vein of APC's first album, Mer do Noms, and it also has some songs that show some progression. <br />Apparently dealing with addiction/recovery, this album is more of a concept album than their previous effort. The following are my opinions and interpretations, if you feel differently that is great, but don't waste space on here telling me I am an idiot.<br />Starts off with The Package, a song dealing with desire, need, obsession. Great song with aggressive drums and an insane sonic peak. At 7:40 is the longest APC song. Song 5/5<br />Weak and Powerless, the first single. Radio friendly song dealing with well, being weak and powerless over your addiction. &quot;Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China, White as dracula as I approach the bottom&quot; China White is a street term for heroin. Monkey on the back, pale, desperate, ravenous. Repetitive chorus steals some of this songs thunder. 4/5<br />The Noose is a great song. Seems to be dealing with someone who has recovered from their addiction but has lost friends/family in the process. &quot;So glad to see you well...not to pull your halo down, around your neck and tug you off your cloud, but I'm more than just a little curious how you're planning to go about making your amends to the dead.&quot; The person speaking to the recovered addict is saying congrats, but let's not forget that you haven't been the angel you are right now. Amazing melody and chorus with amazing sonic textures. 5/5<br />Blue is a song about watching someone die. It has an amazing chorus and bridge that just hooks you into the song. &quot;Calling out to me she's turning blue while I just sit and stare at you.&quot;<BR>I am gussing this song deals with the apathy addicts get while in the grips of their addiction &quot;I just didn't want to know....I just didn't want to know.&quot; Not exactly a happy song, but still well executed 5/5<br />Vanishing is a very untraditional song. Starts off with vocals right at the beginning, then there is no singing for a few minutes, then vocals right before the song ends. Amazing drum beat. Not too much to the lyrical content. 4/5<br />A Stranger is the worst song on the album. It starts nowhere and goes nowhere. Very boring song. Music is too slow for my taste and the strings sound forced....kinda like 'hey let's make a song with strings on it'. Some of the effects sound poorly executed on this song. 2/5<br />The Outsider is one of the best songs on the album. Maynard's voice sounds the best on this track and my only quibble is that the guitars are too quite in certain parts. 5/5<br />Crimes is kinda a filler song. Has awesome sound to it, but all Maynard does is count over the top of it. He counts to 10, which is an exercise they teach you anger management. Not sure if that has any significance but it works with the theme. 4/5<br />The Nurse Who Loved Me is the worst song on the album. I know I said that about A Stranger, but man I think they both are bad enoguh to wear that crown. Horrible vocal effects ruin any chance this song had of ever being good. 2/5<br />Pet is the best song on the album. Hands down. Very aggressive sonically and lyrically. Also one of the best songs to hear live. Song seems to be dealing with taking advantage of a person's naivety. Also one of the few songs Maynard has ever sang on with some political nuances. 5/5<br />Lullabye is the outro to Pet. Cool sound, not much in terms of lyrics. 4/5<br />Gravity is the end of the cd, track 12. The 12th step. The last line of the album is &quot;I choose to live&quot; so don't think this album is all bad, it leaves you with a sense of hope. &quot;Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun.&quot; The song about overcoming all your demons and moving on with your life. Truly a beauty 5/5<br />Buy this cd. Please.
0790733226|5.0|&quot;Each of us is bound by a different covenant.  Each of us seeks truth in our own way.  Each of us, scientist, priest, spiritualist, agnostic, looks for answers that define our existance.  It is the quest, the journey, that each of us shares with one another.&quot;<br />Contact is the story of Eleanor Ann Arroway (Ellie, for short) and her individual, life-long quest to seek answers to the questions &quot;Who are we? Why are we here?&quot;  She seeks answers as a radio-astronomer, heading up a division of S.E.T.I. ((The)Search (for) Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) at Aracebo, and later at the VLA (Very Large Array) in New Mexico.  Her search, which spans many years of her adult, professional life, lead her to the discovery of a radio signal from Vega, a star roughly 4 light-years from Earth.<br />What unfolds in this epic story, originally written by Carl Sagan, reaches far beyond the realm of an average science fiction film.  It is the story of a woman, whose faith in science leaves her with more questions then it answers.  It is the story of a man, torn between the love of a woman, and the faith of the religious covenant he has dedicated his life to.  It is the story of a government, at once skeptical and manipulative, attempting to dictate the actions of a discovery that really belongs to the world.  And, ultimately, it is the story of each of us; of anyone who has ever asked the big questions:  &quot;Who are we?  Why are we here?&quot;<br />Directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starring Jodie Forster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skeritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett and John Hurt, and featuring an incredible soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, this movie, which runs a little over 2 hours is absolutely well worth the time.  It is a story of contact with extra-terrestrials, but also much more, it is a story of contact with ourselves, and the values, beliefs, and covenants we hold most dear.
B0000028UK|5.0|In retrospect the name Versus turned out to be most fitting.  Following the immense success of Ten in 1991, Pearl Jam found themselves under tight media and critical scrutiny in the wake of a popularity battle with Nirvana.  Ten had produced a new sound and created a legion of fans hungry for more wanting to see if Pearl Jam was a fluke of for real.  I think &quot;versus&quot; refers to the inner termoil of the band at the time.  They had to proove to themselves and to their fans that they weren't one album wonders and they did so with gusto and resounding success.<br />If Ten was the birth of grunge and the introduction of Pearl Jam as an epic song writing band with a powerfull emotional prescnece, than Vs. is the further development of that emotion into a listening experience that runs the gammit of many emotions.  The album starts off with an extreme rocker that gets the juices flowing and sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Go is the first of a string of stand out songs that would be the star of other albums but here mixes in to give the listener a special experience.  Even ten years later I still listen to this album all the way through reguarly.  If your older than mid twenties than you probably remember most of these songs form the radio (Daughter, Go, Animal, Elderly Woman, Rearviewmirror) but all the songs are winners.  Rearviewmirror is an amazing display of to tempo building into a listening climax that plainly rocks.  Rats is &quot;music as metaphor&quot; that works on all levels.  Elderly Woman is a vocal ballad that is showed off the power of Vedder's voice like no song before.  My only complaint is Indifference which is ok but doesn't fit in with the quality of the rest of the album.  I like how they tried to end the album on a soft note but the song was a pale effort in comparison to Release which ended their first album.  A small thorn in an otherwise perfect rosebush.<br />Bottom Line:  Pearl Jam accomplished the hardest feat in the music industry...they followed up a classic with another classic.  This is one of those albums that many of my peers and I grew up with and if you are unfamiliar with it you won't be dissapointed.
B000084T18|5.0|Okay...I have to admit...I didn't really think 50Cent would put out a really good C.D.  but then one of my best friends (who must be 50's biggest fan) got his new c.d. which wasn't a big shock to me. She put it on one day and we just couldn't help but gettin' up and dancing.  My mom hates rap...and always listens to a c.d. before I buy it (Unless I buy it when I'm not with her :o)). When she listened to 50's c.d., I thought she was going to say she hated it...but she did the exact opposite!  She started dancin' and asked who it was...I really like 50 and I think everybody can relate to his songs.  His music is 100% original and I LOVE it...I don't know of anyone around here who doesn't have his c.d.  If you don't have it...you should get it!  You won't regret it! 50 must be...the BEST rapper I've ever heard!
B00009APK1|5.0|First of all let me say I think the books are without equal and yes I know this movie changed a few things from the book.  However bearing in mind they had a mere 3 hours to cover the material and the brilliant quality of the film. I for one, am more than prepared to forgive them.<br />A few years ago this movie would have been impossible to create, the special effects that now make it possible like the massed army in the Battle of Helms Deep are nothing short of mind blowing.  The quality of the story despite it being altered a little from the book is as most non puritanical people concede without equal.  I think the casting is terrific and the acting excellent, particularly in the case of Gollum (Andy Serkis).<br />The location could not be bettered, New Zealand seems so perfect for the movie.  I found the beautiful scenery an added bonus I had not considered when I first started to watch The Fellowship.<br />I think these will movies bring this tremendous work to a whole new audience who may not be readers, or who may not be attracted to older classic novels. This alone makes the films worthwhile as a project, quite apart from the superb entertainment they bring to the open minded.<br />I think Tolkien would have approved and been astounded that such a monumental undertaking was even attempted. I also think he would have applauded the product, a nine hour movie that I believe, in time will be as loved and cherished as his temendous novels.  Surely the greatist cinematic achievement of all time.<br />I cannot wait for the third movie, so I can pull the phone out of the wall, lock the doors and watch the complete nine hour epic in one hit.  Ecstasy!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is not pop thus some people wont understand! Once you give this album a chance you ll find it takes you into a whole zone or different plain. Listen up its beautiful! This for me is one of the best rock albums of all time, along with the Benz and one hot minute.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|Emma, a young lady lacking neither fortune or conciquence, is blessed with all the good things in life.  Her father, loving but odd man, has given her the best education, the best clothes, and a good name, she is free to move in good society with few limitations.<br />In her free time, she was lucky enough to match up her governess with a family friend and is now determined to marry off all the other single young people in her neighborhood.  Emma fails most brillently; she doesn't see how people attract and repell others around them--for reasons that they may or may not have any control over.<br />Emma is also blind to her own faults and is not as wise or worldly as she thinks her self to be.  This causes hurt feelings in more than one party, but everything is as it should be when the credits roll.<br />This version of Emma is filled with beautiful people surrounded by beautiful things and carrying out their lives in a beautiful manner.  It is a light, easy film that doesn't take alot of thought to enjoy.
B00005O5JV|2.0|Whereas Legally Blonde did not offend me in any great way, it sure did not entertain me or make me laugh.  This movie just wreaks of daffiness.  Oh so fake and plastic. Way too many scenes are so pathetic and based on some mindless fairy tale.<br />The opening scenes where our Legally Blonde heroine gets dumped by her boyfirned actually is somewhat amusing.  It goes to show you that there are clueless people out there.  The way they portray this blonde as clueless with a 4.0 GPA is kind of odd. The exaggerated behaviors by her ex boyfriends love interest is a bit noticeable as well.<br />However this One Trick Pony gets a little wearisome after a while.  The closing court room scene is based on extreme stupidity of Reese Witherspoon and her alleis who show up at the courtroom like if it were a show.  To think there is a sequel to this mess out there.  Truthfully good people unless you like Soap Operas and mindless drama, I would pass on this low grade dog food of a movie and watch something that has some meaning or some humor.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought this album the moment that it came out (literally) and have since listened to it about 15 times (at least). What I found instantly was that this album was much different from Mar de Noms, as much of the album is much slower, but I still fell instantly in love with it, and the best part is that it just keeps growing on you, almost in an exponential way. All of the songs are excellent, at the time, I would have to say that the highlights are: Weak and Powerless (of course), The Noose, The Outsider, The Package, and my favorite of all....Pet. I recomend this album to all APC fans and anyone else that is ready to listen to some amazing music, and a completely different side to some musicians than many would have never predicted. Like I said before, when I first listened to this album, it was not what I expected, but I immediately found that the unexpected is amazing. Buy this album and tell all your friends to as well, because it is that good.
0385504209|4.0|Once you begin THE DAVINCI CODE you will not be able to put it down.  The story grabs you by the collar and drags you along at a brisk pace.  Dan Brown gives you everything; an albino, monk hitman; a brilliant art historian; a beautiful French detective with a specialty in cryptology; a secret society called the Knights Templar; and a substantive search for the Holy Grail.<br />What places this book a cut above the rest is the layering of art history and religious history integral to the story.  You read the factoids Brown sprinkles here and there and you wonder, &quot;Is that true?&quot;  If any of it is true, Brown has made some pretty controversial statements regarding the foundations of Christian beliefs and traditions.  But that makes it all the more delicious to read.  For those reasons THE DAVINCI CODE is better than your run of the mill cops and robbers mystery/thrillers.<br />The book begins with murder at the Louvre Museum near the Mona Lisa.  Clues are left everywhere and everything written has meaning and will be referred to later in the book.  The characters are very clearly delineated and do not melt into one another.  I was stunned by how breezily this book reads and how many twists and turns Brown threw into the mix.<br />Then I got to page 405 and became very disappointed.  At that point I found the book a bit unbelievable.  Up to page 405 everything seemed plausible.  But the book had a heavy head of steam up to that revelation.  The very end was a bit underwhelming, as the first 400 pages promised much more.<br />I highly recommend this read, but the conclusions to all the characters were a little too pat and easy.  There is no big shoot out at the end, but I expected something a bit more exciting than what I received.

B000002UAX|2.0|I am a longtime fan of rock music, but I don't believe that the Beatles were the best rock band ever.  They used to rock up through A Hard Day's Night and Help, but then went down the road of easy listening and pop.<br />This album is OK.  It has 10 good songs, which I wish were all on one CD, and I wish the other 20 songs were on a separate CD so I wouldn't have to keep skipping over them.<br />Gems like Back in the USSR are great, but there is a lot of mediocrity here.  10 songs out of 30 = 2 stars.
0316666343|5.0|Since some other reviewers have provided a synopsis, I'll concentrate solely on my thoughts.<br />A point of view so unique it sounds bizarre -- a teenage girl who is killed is the narrator as she watches her family and friends as they carry on after her death.  This is not so strange!<br />Instead, I found it hopeful and full of keen observation and understanding that had me considering life in a much more indepth way.<br />Upon reading the last page, I could almost have cried with *joy*.  What a beautiful story.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|The only thing that I am at all pleased about this movie is that I saw it for $3 after it had gone to the cheap theaters (and notice how quickly after it was released THAT happened - there's a reason).  Actually, I was annoyed to have even spent $3 on it, and would probably have been annoyed if I had seen it for free.  It's just that bad.<br />To further explain: this movie is far from finished - you get the distinct impression you are watching a rough draft, as this isn't so much a movie as a sequence of (oftentimes unrelated) scenes watched back to back.  The plot was so thin, it was utterly incapable of holding this hodge-podge of scenes together; what results is some lame jokes (almost all repeats from the first film), a lot of pointless action, several pointless characters (what was the point of that orphan kid, or the \\"thin man\\" from the first movie, anyway?), and about 2 wasted hours of your time.<br />Under no circumstances should you see this movie in a theater, and I strongly encourage you not to even rent it - it really is just THAT BAD.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I watched Gosford Park because of the comparisons to \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" and similar films. Well, Gosford park was NOTHING like \\"Upstairs Downstairs.\\"<br />The plot? Difficult to describe! A whole group of titled gentry converge on an English mansion for some inexplicable purpose. During their time there, a rich unlikable man is murdered. What follows is vigorous interviews by a bumbling constable and his competent sidekick, and endless endless, mindless scenes with coarse crude servants, and rich snobbish nobility. Is this supposed to be a plot? I don't think so.<br />While I was prepared to like Gosford Park, I found the plot way too meandering for my taste. The protagonist, Mary, is ill-defined, and the rest of the cast just seem to show up at odd points throughout the story with no apparent reason or motive, or reason.<br />Even the killer, seemed to lack sufficient motive to do the deed. By the end of this film I admit I found myself counting the seconds until it ended. Gratuitous sex scenes were added to produce the \\"R\\" rating which could quite easily have been edited out, and had no bearing on the story. Overall...I consider Gosford Park to be frustrating. It had potential... But too many characters, no editing, and endless meandering dialog just ruined it for me.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|In many ways, I have always thought of \\"Tool\\" as a very angry version of \\"Pink Floyd.\\"  \\"Tools' Aenima\\" CD always reminded me of a twisted version of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" - Melodically strange, yet very cool.  Then along came \\"A Perfect Circle,\\" Maynards' other band, as people like to say. A band that I found to be a bit like \\"Tool\\" but possess a far more commercialized touch with darkening, boisterous melodies.  Their first release (Mer De Noms) really had some choice cuts and proved, to the music industry, that dark music can be beautiful, powerful and addicting.  Their new CD, \\"Thirteen Steps,\\" is a step closer to \\"Tool\\" and a far cry from the dark melodic, yet commercial undertones of their first CD.  Most of the music sounds redundant, seems to lack focus, and is void of any direction that their first release was taking me.  There are a few choice cuts, weak and powerless, Blue, The Outsider and Pet have the unique ability to get under the skin.  Then, of course, is Maynards' rant against God, Christ, or whomever on \\"The Noose\\" -- I have never been able to figure-out what Maynard's problem is in this area, or should I be looking at it as a rant about organized religion?  There is another strange little orchestrated piece called, \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me.\\"  It seems a bit out of place for \\"A Perfect Circle,\\" however, I'm not surprised by strange little obscurities from any band - I got news guys, The Beatles were doing strange little off-center tunes clear back in the 60s'. <br />In the end, most of the CD seems a bit, too, experimental and does a rather dull job in trying to find a central focal point.  The overall darkness is still prevalent on \\"Thirteen Steps,\\" it just seems to lack the exhilarating melodies delivered on \\"Mer De Noms.\\"  It is quite possible that I my need to give the new effort some time to get under my skin, but for now I was expecting something with a little more life.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|As an avid buyer of music, this is by far the best album I have heard since... well, a long time.  I can listen to this album from beginning to end without fast forwarding a track.  It is refreshing, unique, and addictive.  I am very proud of Badu because for someone who has been on the charts with every release, she could have concentrated on recording radio-friendly singles but it seems this masterpiece came straight from her artist soul.  Buy one for you and one for someone you love.  EXCELLENT ALBUM!
0763619612|5.0|This book actually has an ageless appeal to all of us who feel 'I'm not an artist'. I'm a middle school art teacher, and it also charmingly shows how a gentle nudge by a teacher can start a snowball of creativity!
B00005JLSE|1.0|I'd like to say I'm a fan of great musicals, but the truth of the matter is I'm a fan of any musical, even if it's bad, and I still couldn't stand this movie... it's up there on my list of worst movies of all time.  I thank goodness I didn't see this in the theater, there is no way I could've sat through the whole thing, fortunately my dvd player allows me to speed through movies with sound so at least I got through the whole thing in half the time.  I kept thinking it just *had* to get better, but it didn't.  The characters were pathetic and completely nondeveloped.  The story line sounds more interesting than it is, honestly!  I've never seen Renee Zellweger look worse, throughout the whole movie I just had to keep blurring my vision to make seeing her bearable... and I loved her in Bridget Jone's Diary and even Me, Myself, and Irene, so it's not like I'm asking for much.  I tried so hard to like this movie and I just couldn't.  If you, like me, realize in the first 10 minutes that this is a truly horrible ludicrous movie, don't bother continuing to watch in the hopes that it will get better, it doesn't, I promise, I don't care how much money you've invested it's not worth the added insult of wasting your time.  Maybe if you are a big fan of CZJ (I'm not, but I did love her in Blue Juice and I usually loathe surfer movies).... naaah, even then it's not worth it, she's so done up and over the top it's just down right creepy and annoying.  The tall, skinny, redhead was an amazing dancer... I'm reaching here, there was that 3 or 4 seconds that I was desparate to find something to enjoy and that was about it.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I watched this movie thinking it would live up to its billing. Instead, it was almost two hours of absolute, boring trash! I still can't believe this garbage won Best Picture. There's no way this film is better than the second installment of Lord of the Rings. Some critics hailed this movie as a wonderful return of the musical. That's hardly the case. If anything, this film is excrement in fancy wrapping. If you must see this movie, save yourself some money and rent it instead. It's too bad the copy I rented didn't have a self-destruct feature.
0156027321|5.0|Quite simply, The Life of Pi is one brilliant book.  Most recently awarded the prestigious Booker Prize, the epic story of Piscine Molitor Patel, AKA Pi, the central character of this sweeping novel, is nothing less than an examination of faith, god, religion and life.  Born in India, the son of a zookeeper Pi's life veers quickly and inexorably from the rich colors of India to a small lifeboat in which he finds himself stranded with a man-eating Bengal tiger (named Richard Parker, thank you very much) in the vast ocean.<br />Along the way, the story takes the reader through a world tour of Islam, Christianity and Hinduism with a critical eye and a master's command of language and philosophy.  No school escapes Martel's bite, but it is a nip from heart as well as an agile mind.  \\"...reason, that fool's gold for the bright\\"  he warns.  <BR>There is much to recommend this book, not the least of which is the underlying thinking of author Martel that permeates and perfumes the beautiful prose.  \\"I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces.  Religion faces the same problem.  Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.\\"  He observes.<BR>\\"To choose doubt as a philosophy of Life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\" He continues.  No world religion escapes his loving, but critical eye as the story of The Life of Pi churns around the reader like Pi himself, alone in the middle of the ocean.  And the ideas in the book prowl around like that man-eating tiger.  In the end, the story is as uplifting as it is well-written; a tale of a seeker whose dark night of the soul is lit by Blake's \\"tyger, tyger burning bright.\\" And if there is still any question about \\"What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\"...Yann Martel has answered the question.<BR> <BR>Brilliant, moving, enchanting...The Life of Pi is a must-read.<br />Reviewed by Bo Young in White Crane Journal
B00000DOZW|5.0|When Peter Gabriel left Genesis in 1975, most observers figured the band was through. But by the time the news broke, the band was already a month into work on a new album. Unable to settle on a replacement singer, the group finally concluded that drummer Phil Collins was better than the people they were auditioning. The resulting album ended up outselling any of their albums with Gabriel.<br />This is a wonderful album, from the moment the first punches of &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; jump out of Mike Rutherford's gentle guitar intro, to Collins revisiting &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; lyrics during the fade-out of &quot;Los Endos&quot;. Strong rockers like &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot;, &quot;Squonk&quot;, and &quot;Los Endos&quot; are intermixed with magical ballads like &quot;Entangled&quot; and &quot;Ripples&quot;. David Hentschel's production is clearer than on most previous Genesis albums; in particular, Collins' drums are more audible in the mix than ever before. With Gabriel's strong personality gone, keyboardist Tony Banks began to dominate the band; he worked keyboard solos into everyone else's songs, and got a couple of long-dormant songs of his own (&quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;, &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot;) onto the album. But everything Banks does works here (not always the case on the follow-up, &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot;). A side effect of Banks' emergence was that guitarist Steve Hackett got fewer leads to play; on &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot;, he barely appears. Hackett and Rutherford use the trademark Genesis dual 12-string acoustic sound to great effect on Hackett's &quot;Entangled&quot; and Rutherford's &quot;Ripples&quot;. &quot;Los Endos&quot; provides a big finish with a blazing instrumental that uses a riff from &quot;It's Yourself&quot; (a song that was left off the album, but is available on the &quot;Archive #2&quot; boxed set) and throws in reprises of &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; and &quot;Squonk&quot;; the song became the closer of Genesis' live set for over a decade. For lovers of time signatures, &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; and the bridge of &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot; are in 7/8, while the keyboard solo in &quot;Robbery Assault &amp; Battery&quot; is in a near-uncountable 13/8. This is a close second to &quot;Foxtrot&quot; as my favorite Genesis album.<br />(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)
B0000640VN|5.0|I picked this movie up because it looked less bad than everything else at the rental place.  It was a time travel movie after all.  I enjoyed it, and realized it was special when before the director's cut there was a warning.  The studio wanted to make sure that they didn't necessarily agree with the director.  <br />When the director explained his point of view about what we've lost, and how career woman might not be the best choice, I could see that it really went against the grain of what the Machine would want us to believe.  The director's commentary really made me think alot.  And that's rare for a hollywood picture.
B000099T2L|5.0|This CD was the bomb okay you just don't know good music. Beyonce did her thang. You go girl. I love Dangerously In Love. It is my favorite CD.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I gave the album a four star rating, but it is very likely my opinion will rise to a five star level with time.  I have listened through the album only four times.  Albums that have a new and innovative sound (like APC's first release, the tool albums, and radiohead's work) need repeated listening to bring out the true majesty of the artwork.  The subtle textures that aren't apparent at first.  I like the CD already, &quot;The Noose&quot; is the stand-out track on the the album so far, but my favorite on Mer De Noms kept evolving and changing along with my opinion of the album, I can only assume the same will happen this time.  Buy the album and support these incredible musicians who really do what they can to create artistic and deeply moving music.

B000089RVX|5.0|Well i love a lot of styles of music, but dear god THIS CD IS AWESOME.  Amy Lee's voice has to be one of the most beautiful voices...ever...period, Alicia Keyes has nothing on her.  The songs are dark, haunting and Amy's voice does one of the best jobs taking them to the next level.<br />1. Going Unde(9/10) - The second single of the CD, and one of the best songs I might add, Amy's voice turns into almost a hard scream but she still keeps her opera-distinct stle.<br />2. Bring Me to Life(9.5/10) - A very good song that most of you have heard, i would give this a 10 but it was overplayed, but nonetheless it is a phenominal ballad and Amy's voice sounds that of an angel.<br />3. Everybody's fool(9/10) - A great melody and good synthesizer effects, accompanied by Ben moody's amazing guitur skills.<br />4. My Immortal(10/10) - wow, all i can say is just...wow.  Amy's voice sends chills down my spine along with the great piano effects, the best slower song i have ever heard.<br />5. Haunted(9/10) - I like this song's lyrics and i love the effects in it such as the flatlineing heart beat monitor, overall a great song.<br />6. Tournaquet(1000000/10) - Best song on the album in my opinon, great lyrics about God, Suicide, you can feel Amy's pain, anyone whos ever felt alone and lost bythemselves will connect with this song in a great way. Thank you Amy.<br />7. Imaginary (10/10) - I love this song, has a great begging with violins and some great guitar work by Ben Moody and as always the piano is very well placed in the song. seeing how I have the depression disease i can fully connect with Amy's lyrics in a great way, its nice to see that someone out there knows what its like. I love the lyrics in this one such as\\"I lay inside myslef FOR HOURS!!!!\\"<br />8. Taking over Me (9/10) - Many say this is the best song, but thats there opinoin. dont get me wrong it is an excellent song, but not hte best.<br />9. Hello(8/10) - the other slow song on the album.  The only song that i kind of dislike but i still like it nonetheless.  Ths only thing is i dont really like the melody but Amy's voice and poetic lyrics never fail.<br />10. My last breath(9/10) - A great song filled with lyrics of love, dispair,and lonliness.  The only thing is i think they could have done better job with the music itslef, but it is still great.<br />11. Whisper(9/10) - Whisper? whisper my [butt]! Amy comes strong and loud here my friends.  Along with a church choir chanting cerses in Latin accompanied by some very well done violin work.<br />Well there you ahve it, these 11 tracks are better than the other 200 some cds i have and i have had this cd for sometime, and it has not left my cd player, do yourself a favor and spen the 13$ for this great piece of art, you will not regret it. and also buy it for the booklet itself, AMY LEE IS SO HOT!!!
B00006ZCFH|2.0|As an avid loving and adoring fan of E. Badu.  I was extremly disappointed in this cd.  I almost want to ask if she was on drugs when she recorded this album.  It doesn't reflect the creative and innovative Badu that I once knew.  The lyrics lack true writing skills and the vocals are a bit tired and predictable.  I won't abandon her but I also wouldn't reccomend this cd to anyone who wants to hear really good music.  If you want to get your money's worth then buy Kindred, Kem, Floetry, or Ledisi.  I am also <BR>looking forward to Rhian Benson's cd when it drops.
B00005JL7Q|1.0|Umh.. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't a movie based on a book have oh I don't know a little something to do with the BOOK. About a boy (the book)was set in the 90's had a lot to do with Kurt Cobain and was funny. The movie was set in our time talked about gangsta rap and wasn't even remotely funny. What happened to Marcus? I don't recall him being as half as annoying in the book, and he was annoying. None of the other people got to devlope the way they'd did in the book. In fact this whole movie seemed to be about...nothing. And Will was just a moron. Hugh Grant as a bad boy in Bridget Jones. Charming. Hugh Grant as a bad boy in this movie. Well it was just sad. And the whole singing thing? Was that meant to be funny.I was like god why won't this end. I saw this movie for free and still felt ripped off. Making a movie about a book can't be that hard can it. The book serves as the base for your screenplay. I mean it's like taking an open-book quiz and STILL getting a F.

6304044836|1.0|If you ever liked the old version with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, don't even look at this one! The comparison to Bogart to Ford is zip, nada, nothing!!! The wonderful music from the old Sabrina didn't appear in this one... they barely put in &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot; one of the most romatic songs from the old version! I guess I'm too much of a Bogart fan to allow any man to take his place. Harrison Ford, I think, was much past his prime in this movie... And nobody can say the wonderful lines Boggy did... &quot;It's all in the family&quot;... Whenever Ford said all the lines, they just fell flat. Anyway... If you liked the old one, don't watch this one! I guess if you are a great fan of Ford you might enjoy it, but other than that, I don't think anyone can compare to Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden! Watch the OLD one! NOT the new!!! I promise you'll enjoy the old one much better!
044100590X|5.0|DUNE is, simply put, a masterpiece.  It's also a legend with spawned a movie and two TV miniseries which are nearly as famous as the novel.  Frank Herbert's science fiction/fantasy tale centers around Paul Atreides, a young man who has recently moved to the planet Arrakis, better known as Dune, sometime in the far future.  Paul is the son of a duke, and after the duke is murdered in a raid by the evil Harkonnen family, Paul and his mother journey in to the desert.  From there, a prophecy shall be fulfilled and life as Herbert's characters know it, will change dramatically.<br />Never have I read a book as realistic as Dune.  It plays out almost like a historical fiction.  The characters are so real, with so much emotion, you can't help but believe these people may one day truly exist.<br />The story, which took in the first Nebula award, is complicated and may throw off some readers.  Indeed, the book itself may prove to be a challenge to many readers.  Unfortunately many will put down the book after the first about 100 pages, during which it is somewhat uninteresting.  But, if you should make it past those pages, you'll find one of the most interesting and life-like masterpieces of our time.
B00008AY3L|5.0|This is an excellent CD, period.  Ben has such a variation of songs, and a variation of talents.  He can do everything, funk, rock, reggae, accoustic, and just about everything else I didn't mention.  Simply amazing.  Ben is also one of the least known, but most talented artists of our time.  Hopefully he will finally get the recognition that he deserves.  Go buy this CD, you will not regret it.

B00003CXA3|4.0|Adapted from Robin Moore's fact-based novel, THE FRENCH CONNECTION was the breakthrough film for both direction William Friedkin, who later went on to direct THE EXORCIST, and Gene Hackman.  Hackman stars in his Academy Award-winning role as &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle, a New York City cop who, along with partner &quot;Cloudy&quot; Russo (Roy Scheider), stumbles upon a drug ring headed by a Frenchman (Fernando Rey) who uses an innocent-seeming actor (Frederic de Pasquale) to cover the operation.  Along with Hackman's forementioned award for &quot;Best Actor&quot;, the film also took in Best Director for Friedkin; Best Film Editing; Best Writing (Ernest Tidyman) and a deserved Best Picture.  The chase scenes are outstanding and some of the best ever filmed; Hackman is excellent in one of his greatest roles.  Action fans won't want to pass this one by; followed by FRENCH CONNECTION II and a floppish TV movie.
B00007LTIC|5.0|&quot;Going For The One&quot;'s extremely positive, optimistic feel may have had something to do with Wakeman's return, or its<BR>being recorded in the mountains, but whatever the case it is Yes' warmest effort and one of their top three or four finest albums.  The no-holds-barred experimentalism of &quot;Tales&quot; and &quot;Relayer&quot; were over, replaced by a return to the succinct mix of experimentation and accessibility that had marked &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot; and most of &quot;Close To The Edge&quot;.  GFTO is an extremely straightforward work and one of their most satisfying and uplifting on a first listen; although some fans complain that the band began their move backwards here, this album was just what they needed after the previous two (as brilliant as &quot;Relayer&quot; was), and most importantly, the quality was still superb (save &quot;Parallels&quot;, an OK but somewhat AOR-ish rocker).  I would have been perfectly happy had they kept on making albums like this one (well not *exactly* the same, as that would have eventually gotten boring, but containing the same general mix of pop and prog).<br />The opening title track is a delirious, fun rocker that was unlike anything they had yet attempted; Howe goes crazy on his slide at the end, creating a kind of &quot;cosmic country&quot; feel.  The song is commercial but definitely quirky enough--and spirited enough--to become a favorite.  &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot; takes the album into the stratosphere: this remains one of their best-ever tracks, an extremely moving and emotional tale that gives lie to the the assertion that prog-rock was a soulless, &quot;mechanical&quot; exercise (indeed, the whole album gives lie to that statement).<BR>The interplay between Howe's guitar and Wakeman's piano is simple but brilliant, and proves that when the band honed and focused their incredible instrumental skills they could create<BR>some of their best-ever work.  &quot;Parallels&quot; isanother rocker like the title track with a lot of energy and an interesting church organ sound, but is not quite as distinctive overall and the only slightly below-par cut here IMO. <br />&quot;Wonderous Stories&quot;, which follows, more than makes up for it by being their finest hit single, a song that manages to encapsulate a sense of magic and wonder in a mere 3 1/2 minutes, and prove (along with &quot;Your Move&quot;, the &quot;Roundabout&quot; edit and &quot;Owner Of A Lonely Heart&quot;) that the group could master the compact pop format; Anderson's vocal is sublime.  Finally, the closing 16-minute &quot;Awaken&quot; proves that they hadn't lost their prog chops, either.  Although technically a little less complex than their earlier side-long epics, it is still (especially the first half, with Howe spitting out guitar licks at 1000MPH against another odd time sig) pretty heady stuff.  But even more importantly, it subscribes to the rest of the album's philosophy of keeping things as catchy, melodic, and high-spirited as possible, with absolutely none of the padding or excess that marred &quot;Tales&quot;.  Every note counts, and after a beautiful spacey interlude Anderson returns to summon the cosmos once more; the resultant wall-of-sound was once described by the singer as the band's greatest accomplishment, and many fans over the years have agreed--if you haven't shed a small tear by its intimate closing lines, then I don't know what music to recommend!<br />As if the quality of the album itself wasn't enough, the bonus tracks here are the most numerous and most interesting of the remaster series.  &quot;Montreaux&quot;, &quot;Vevey&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; were all fascinating instrumental doodles used in the 1991 box set,and &quot;Vevey&quot; is heard for the first time in its entirely.<BR>&quot;Going For The One&quot; and esp &quot;Parallels&quot; both benefit from being heard in their raw, rocking rehearsal form.  &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot; is heard here in a radically different electric version that one may think would not fit the song, but it really is <BR>a fascinating listen, with Howe on fire.  It is also great to see how &quot;Awaken&quot; developed, in the same way as &quot;The Ancient&quot; or &quot;The Gates Of Delirium&quot; on the other remasters.  But it is &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot; that got to me the most.  Anyways, any fan of this album should pick it up now, and for anyone who hasn't heard it, it makes both a great introduction and a great addition to any Yes collection.
006109594X|1.0|I picked up this book recently, but didn't get what I hoped for. I have a mild addiction to military/espionage thrillers. I grew up on World War II novels, but it was _The Hunt for Red October_ that gave me a taste for modern settings. I greatly enjoyed reading both _...Red October_ and _Red Storm Rising_ ten years ago. Ever since then I have occasionally picked up a military thriller for fun.<br />I see here that _Nimitz Class_ is actually the first book of a series. I can only hope that the others got better, though I don't think I'll spend the time to find out for myself. These characters were way too shallow and two-dimensional for my taste. Every time they meet one another, it's like a gathering of the gods on Mt. Olympus-every one is so admirable, experienced, capable and wonderful-they're straining their shoulders trying to pat each other on the back so much.<br />Several of the plot developments were also made easily predictable because the writer telegraphs his moves. For example, at one point the main character's mother tells him to bring a woman with him when he moves home after resigning his commission. Just a few pages later, one of the admirable admirals says he wants to introduce his daughter. Before she even appears on the page, I know that she is going to be going to a new home in Kansas by the end of the book (sorry if I ruined that for anyone, but gosh, if you didn't see it coming...).<br />Finally, I noticed a few technical mistakes, which didn't help the credibility of the story. For example, it is implied in the book that the current in the Bosporus always flows from North to South. I know from personal experience that this is not true. The current changes direction with the tides. Either a high tide is filling the Black Sea with Mediteranean water or a low tide is draining that water back out.<br />To its credit, this book has a plot that moves along just as briskly as that Bosporus current. But nonetheless I found it too shallow to be reallyenjoyable.
0679759328|5.0|British author Anita Brookner poses many difficult questions in Hotel du Lac, not the least of which is what, really, can women expect to achieve in this world? This novel, which won the Booker in 1984, like her others, has a main character who is sensitive and solitary - not the stuff of which an adventure tale could be told. But at the book's end, a lot has happened. Her family fears Edith, a 39yo romance novelist, is headed for a nervous breakdown when she stands up her fianc on their wedding day. They send her to Switzerland, where she spends her days working on her next book, observing other guests at the hotel on the lake, and communing with her married lover. <BR>Doesn't sound like much, does it? Suspend your disbelief and read it. It's excellent.

B000000OTU|4.0|Back in 1986, I was introduced to Aerosmith by my cousin per their greatest hits CD. They were in my mind a classic rock group that was finished. I mean a Greatest Hits compilation usually equates to a band's demise...right?<br />Well everyone, including myself was soon to witness the rebirth of a band most thought were finished. Having battled their demons, Aerosmith not only resurfaced, but had more success the seond time around. With their release of Permanent Vacation and Pump, Boston's boys led the late 80's to early 90's rock scene.<br />This CD contains hits from the second chapter of Aerosmith, the one I grew up with and that is dear to me most. If they stop making records now, they have nothing to worry...for they have etched their claim as one of the U.S.'s greatest groups ever.

0446310786|4.0|I, like many, read _To Kill a Mockingbird_ for the first time in high school.  And no doubt, like many, was tepid about it - the book was ok, but nothing to get excited about.  Years later, with the benefit of some living, however, I have an entirely new appreciation for it.  Like good wine, the story improved with age.<br />The story is a vivid description of the pre-civil rights south, with its rigid racial divisions and class structure.  The plot revolves around the alleged rape of a white girl by a black man and the trial that takes place.  Naturally the prejustices and social mores play an important part in the tale - as do the lessons Harper Lee has to teach about growing up and the injustices that life has.<br />It is an American classic and Pulitzer Prize winner - but I think for most readers just entering adulthood, the beauty and honesty of the book is lost for a lack of years.  Read it again, years later and enjoy a whole other (more subtle) novel.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb brilliantly weaves together ideas from many disciplines. A must read for anyone seeking a perspective on the topic.
0385512104|5.0|You can read the plot summary in other's reviews so I'll just dive right in.<BR>This book is truly amazing.  It's warm and funny, poignant, at times almost heartbreakingly so, and very well written.  Everything fits neatly together, from the math puzzles here and there, to the carefully drawn maps and time tables by which Christopher, our hero, plots out his daily life. Even the oddly numbered chapters add to our understanding and appreciation for a child who sees our world from a totally different perspective.<br />The characters were all well rounded  and the plot, a murder mystery and more, just carried me along. All this came packaged in a short and surprisingly successful first novel.<BR>A must read.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I think Johnny Cash began recording in 1955, shortly after I was born (I didn't have anything to do with him being recorded, it's just to give some sort of context to my review). So I would estimate I've heard almost all of Johnny Cash's albums at least 10 times a piece. I seen him in live concerts - for the record, he was a very nice man who put on a tremendous show.  But I never thought I would willingly seek out his music - after all that music was for my Parents_, particularly my dad - why would I choose to listen to it now?<br />But &quot;my sweetest friend&quot; wanted this cd, along with the other American recordings. This cd is powerful and all the emotions are there, palpable, so close you can feel the tears. Mr Cash does an amazing job on all the songs, but the stand out here is &quot;Hurt&quot; and the video of it. The imagery is so moving, so striking, especially if you knew of his life - the drugs, the jails, the many problems - it seems to reflect Mr Cash so well. Mr Reznor wrote and performed this song first (with Nine Inch Nails) but I don't think I will ever be able to associate it with anyone except Johnny Cash.  And that's what Johnny Cash does - he stamps a song with his own feelings and shadings so completely, it's difficult to imagine anyone else doing it.<br />Listen to the Beatles song &quot;In My Life&quot; - to hear a man of Johnny Cash's age and experience sing this song gives it a multitude of shadings that doesn't exist in the Beatles version. His rendition of Sting's &quot;I Hung My Head&quot; reminded me of my thoughts when I first  heard the song - that it could have been a Johnny Cash song.<br />If you're wondering if you should buy this cd with the additional video, my answer is _yes_ go for it. It's not the &quot;feel good&quot; video of the year, but it will definitely make you think and feel and react.<br />Thomas Dolby says something like &quot;nothing ever leaves the airwaves&quot; and I hope he's right - it's a small measure of comfort to think Johnny Cash's voice will be bouncing around and off the universe for all time.e of comfort to think Johnny Cash's voice will be bouncing around and off the universe for all time.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I loved LOTR, the book &amp; the movie. The movies were both easily the best of the year respectively. Everything fit perfectly. The CGI Gollum, as well as all of the effects. As far as the DVD is concerned I was very happy that ALL of the DVD is closed caption not just the movie, which is great for hearing impaired &amp; people like myself who have some difficulty hearing subtle audio parts. The only criticism I have is the DVD needs a play all like the first did.
B00006IUL7|3.0|This  psychological thriller is based upon Norwegian writer Erik Skjoldbjaerg's novel of the same title.  Al Pacino took a 4 year absence from acting before this film, and it's no surprise that this one broke him from his hiatus, as it has a great script and it stars two other Academy Award winning performers, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams.  <br />Set in Alaska, this film is about Will Dormer, a veteran LA detective, played by Pacino. Dormer is sent with partner Hap Eckhart to investigate the grisly murder of a 17-year-old girl. At the same time, Dormer & Eckhart are being investigated by internal affairs for some suspicious police work, which Dormer believes Eckhart is about to spill the beans about. <br />The two colleagues are welcomed in Alaska by Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a policewoman who is also interested in solving this strange case. Dormer accidentally shoots his partner Eckhart, but knows how it will look if he confesses to the shooting, so he misleads them to believe that the suspect did the shooting and continues the investigation.  The story goes through some interesting twists and turns from there on.<br />Three academy award winners in one movie that is based on a fantastic book with the same director as Memento seems like a sure winner, and it certainly did well at the box office, but it falls flat.  Perhaps Swank and Pacino are afraid to upstage each other, as both their performances lack emotional depth and energy.  Williams' performance is shockingly superb, however, as this role is a side of him not yet seen and he plays it very well.  He finally shows he is a talented actor with more range than the Patch Adams and Mrs Doubtfire roles he usually takes.  Williams' great performance can't save this film though, as it just doesn't get to the heart.  The lack of emotional impact of it has is disappointing, as the criminal is more interesting and complex than the cops.  The line fine they are creating between cop and criminal isn't lost on me, but Pacino's character is wooden and emotionally superficial and there's a void in the film where a great character should be.<br />This movie is proof that too many chefs spoil the cake, as too many great actors made what should have been a spectacular film into this mediocre film.
078322947X|4.0|This has been one of my all time favorite films since I first saw it in the theater decades ago. I saw it once, but its music and images have haunted me since. I am surprised how many other people feel as I do. Until this moment, I thought I was the only one who even remember this movie[...] Of all the new horrible movies out there, can't we save this one classic!<br />One last thing, am I the only one who has noticed how much Apocalypse Now borrowed from this film?
B0000024JN|5.0|Rap was an underground phenomenon primarily because it was blacks' music.  Nevermind that some of the best hip hop artists in history were pumping out masterpieces before 1986.  They were black.  And for that reason, the music didn't appeal to an American audience (primarily white).  Therefore it was inevitable that white guys were going to bring rap to the mainstream and 1986 was the year when it began to happen.  The amazing thing is, we didn't get corny white guys who could pump out an occasional catchy single (I present Vanilla Ice).  We had the most talented white rap group that ever was.  The Beasties were geniuses and this record shows it.  Sure they ripped off about every beat and overexaggerated their street-smarts, but they pulled it off and remained beleivable.  Rick Ruben (the producer) was smart enough to intermingle with some kickass metal riffs which got the rock fans interested, but the Beasties pulled their own weight.  Their lyrics are insane, funny, and incredibly witty.  The first track of the record &quot;Rhymin and Stealin&quot; is one of the most powerful openers on any album and &quot;Fight for your right to Party&quot; is a classic headbanging song.  Despite the fact the Beasties were accused of jeering and parodying rap, they were an enourmous success and along with Run DMC, paved the way for rap and rap-rock to reach the mainstream.  The album is one of the most important albums of the golden age, and of the 80s for that matter.  The Beastie's eclectic taste gives them an unpredictable, fun edge which allows them to pump out corny sing-along songs &quot;Girls&quot;, &quot;Brass Monkey&quot;, poweful rap-rock  &quot;No Sleep till Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Fight for your Right to Party&quot; (which showcases their previous hardcore punk sound)and plain old good rap &quot;Paul Revere&quot;, &quot;The New Style&quot;.  It's a great beginning for one of the most talented and influential bands of our time.
B00008N6N5|5.0|First off...Let me get this out of the way?  Why doesn't anyone talk about Milos Forman?  The guy is one of the best filmmakers ever and nobody talks about him.  Anyway, PVLF is a classic...Period.  Harrelson, Love, Norton all turn in amazing performances.  The set design, music, cinematography, direction, writing are all flawless.  Any movie where we want to cry for Flynt in the end is a must see movie.  One of the best flicks ever in my humble opinion.
B00006EXL5|5.0|mcr has one of the best cds out on shelves right now.  I had never heard the band but i bought their cd to see what it was about, it turned out to be one of the best purchases ive ever made.  There is tons of emotion along catchy guitar rifts that go along perfectly together.  The lead singer has the most awsome voice ive ever heard.  I cant stop listening to this cd.  Tracks 2,3,4,6,and 11 are the catchiest tunes, but the entire cd is well above average.  MCR is the best thing out rite now.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I agree with arturo's review. I had high hopes for this album because I loved the last one. I liked nearly every song on the last album because of their unique, dark sound combined with Maynard's haunting voice. This album was not what I expected at all, either they were trying too hard for a unique sound or they weren't trying hard enough.  &quot;noose&quot; was a wonderful tune and I liked &quot;The nurse who loved me&quot; but beyond that it was quite blase. I am happy I only spent 10.00 on it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If anything, this album is even better than the first. I really liked Mer de Noms, but this one tops it in originality. &quot;The Noose&quot; stood out as one of my favorites right away, along with &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, but these are more like the songs on their first album. &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; are stuck in my head now, and seem to get better each time I hear them. &quot;The Outsider&quot; seemed a bit strange at first, but I'm growing to appreciate it more each time I listen to it, and the same with &quot;Gravity&quot;. I've still not decided whether I like APC's or Failure's version of &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; more; equal but different is the phrase that comes to mind. All of the rest of the songs are brilliant too (I can see their complexity and the intense effort that went into them), just not quite my type (yet! Like others I've noticed that these kind of songs have a way of growing on me over time). Give the album a fair chance to work itself around in your mind and you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLTN|2.0|I went and saw this opening day, and I would have to say that I was somewhat dissapointed with it.  First of all, the computer graphics they used (especially Neo flying) were rather poor.  The story-ok.  I had a hard time focusing on the dialogue since every encounter was a 15 minute conversation that was monotone much like my chemistry teacher giving a lecture. I thought the keymaker was a weak character.  I did not like the way Trinity was made to seem weak when in the first Matrix she was a really strong character.  This movie was way too hyped up and did not live up to the expectations I had.  Maybe the third one will be better.
B00005JM02|4.0|I must admit, I really am not a big fan of Pixar movies.  I find the movies, in general, overrated.  However, I was extremely pleased when I saw Finding Nemo.  I thought the animation was spectacular and the voicing was very well done.  In any case, it's the best movie I think I saw all summer.  Some may say that this isn't saying much considering this summer's releases weren't all that great.  However, I would definately put this film ten notches higher than the other movies.  What I think I liked most about this film is it was a constant adventure.  From the very beginning the viewer is literally immersed in an underwater epic.  Not a moment goes by that the viewer is treated to something new and different.  Overall, I thought the directors and animators did a wonderful job with their imagination and modeling the character's personalities with personalities of the real sea animal.  I commend the directors for coming up with such a complicated plot, while weaving in so many characters and sea creatures.  To go along with this, I am impressed by the attention to detail of this film.  I thought all the characters were well developed and well voiced.  In conclusion, I was immensely satisfied with this flick.  It had the perfect balance of thrills, emotion, and humor.  For someone who doesn't really like Pixar flicks, this movie went above and beyond my expectations.
0156027321|4.0|The magic that Martel portrays in this story is enough to make your heart ache with sadness for the inhabitants of the boat, but has the ability to enlighten their day with just a whisper of hope and fulfillment.  I loved the story and the characters and the quirkyness of Pi Patel with his religious and zoological background and like many others was sad to reach the sudden ending.  <br />An important part for me in any story is the interpretation by the reader as to the meanings and feelings.  In the closing stages, Pi Patel's less than exciting description of his journey to the Japanese investigators involving no animals but only humans got me thinking.  Was this human version the actual account of what happened? The reality may have been so barbaric for a teenage Indian boy of many religious persuasions, that he dealt with the ordeal in the only way he could; by associating the human beings with animals in Pondicherry zoo.  In this way too Pi could justify his previous vegitarian existance by becoming a meat eating Bengal tiger, his alter ego.<br />Just a thought but a lovely book.
B000000XB9|5.0|I like to listen to this album because even it has some bad songs, but to get a full history of a band, you can't listen to just one of their albums. This, as far as Best Ofs go, is top of the line. Plus it's great cause it's full of their catchiest and most fun tunes, so you can play it at get togethers or whatever (not to dance to, though). Anyway, these guys could play the electric guitar like nobody's business. Stellar tracks include Fortunate Son, Proud Mary, and the unbelievable jam version of I Heard It Through the Grapevine. (or &quot;Ah Hooeeed ut thoo tha Graypevahn!&quot;) Actually pretty much every track is good (except for the incredibly annoying long as i can see the light) Good starter, it was for me, and now I want to get all their full albums, if that says anything. Good catchy country rock and roll, way better than Lynyrd Skynyrd. &quot;A&quot;
B000002UAU|2.0|If this were their debut album, 'Beatlemania' never would have happened;  the screams of young fans would have been replaced with yawns - which is the exact reaction this album receives from those of us who never bought the hype. <br />The ideas popularized by this album, and the Beatles in general,  are still common today. Nobody disputes this.  But, then, this is hardly a compliment.  The &quot;revolutionary&quot; idea behind this album was to spend months and months touching-up mediocre songs with studio wizardry.  This idea helps sell millions, and is thus important to Beatles fans who pay close attention to charts and sales-figures, and use them as an artistic yardstick.    Couple this with a cutesy teen-friendly band image, tv appearances (*very* important) and completely harmless music comprised of brainless singalongs... and you have the Beatles formula, and the formula for most modern pop music.    So, I guess it's true that pop music is the way it is today thanks to the beatles.  It's also ironic that the old nostalgic folk who adore the Beatles can somehow absolutely hate their modern counterparts (such as the Spice Girls).  Why the double standard?  They made the same music afterall.   <BR> <BR>Few would disagree that this album is better remembered for its cover than for its songs. And, if possible, the cover has dated even worse than the music. <br />No one is impressed by this album anymore. It's a historical curiousity, nothing more.<br />If this album really was the greatest music of the century, then I would never listen to music ever again.
B000002UB6|4.0|This record sounds like it could be a White Stripes album. That sounds weird, but some of it is just as stripped down, bluesy, and undeniably cool. I could buy this album just for Dig a Pony, a Lennon song in the same vein as Yer Blues and Happiness Is a Warm Gun. However, they are so cool that they included a version of their old school classic, One After 909, which has an organ and primal 50s rock feel. Paul has a few sappy ballads (The Long and Winding Road, Let It Be) which are not bad, but he also contributes some rockers (Get Back, I've Got a Feeling). On the latter, and also Two of Us, John and Paul's chemistry is unparalled, whereas on Dig It and Maggie May, the band doesn't really seem to care all that much. George's songs and performances are great as usual, but not quite so much as on revolver, The White Album, or Abbey Road. However, For You Blue has some good slide guitar and 12-bar blues, and I Me Mine sounds a little like a fast-paced but just as dark version of Blue Jay Way. Ringo sounds good, nothing special. Not bad, either, I'm just saying.... So, some of this is live. The Beatles were, frankly, not a very good live band. (in my opinion). It shows little, though. This album takes some getting used to, and it's kind of short, but if you really listen to it and give it a chance, you'll be as richly awarded as with any other Beatles album, which means it is excellent. B+.
B000002U9W|4.0|If only Ron Geesin had never been allowed in the studio!  Otherwise I'm sure I would be giving this album a full 5 stars.  All in all, Pink Floyd's members perform wonderfully, even on my least favorite, the title track.  Richard Wright begins to show hints of his more mature Hammond-playing style.  Also, David Gilmour truly begins to come into his own as a guitarist.  Unfortunately, the annoying intrusions of Geesin's choir (and to some extent the horn section as well) greatly diminish the title track.  There was potential there--if only they had gone it alone!<br />The other much-maligned longer suite, &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;, is far more successful, and truly Floydian.  Yes, the eating noises become really nasty at one point, but that's its only real drawback.  Otherwise, APB has some bright, snappy band jams that make a very filling &quot;meal&quot; for the listeners.  I'd like to make the point that this is *not* drug music contrary to what some think--this is of too high of a quality to have been thrown together under the influence.<br />Roger Waters' simple, heartfelt &quot;If&quot; I could go on all day about.  Here, without any hint of the belligerence he built up over the years, Mr. Waters tentatively, shyly lets the listener hear perhaps even more clearly than on The Final Cut or &quot;Flickering Flame&quot; who he really is.  A young man, dealing with the numerous contradictions, insecurities, and aspirations within himself delivers his touching lyrics in an unusually soft, vulnerable, even &quot;Wrightish&quot; manner.  For this, &quot;If&quot; is a truly precious gem.  There are no barriers of anger that prevent me from making a full &quot;connection&quot; with what he sings of--of being someone who seeks companionship and understanding in a very confusing world.  &quot;If I were a good man, I'd understand the spaces between friends.&quot;  But at this time...I feel he *was* still trying, and that's why I am able to empathize.  Peopleoften confuse mere bluntness with honesty--unlike Animals and other venomous lyrics...this is *true* honesty.<br />The next track is equally stunning--Richard Wright's &quot;Summer '68&quot;.  There's more substance to this than simply a song about cavorting with groupies.  The character Mr. Wright assumes actually has some interesting things to say.  Perhaps inspired by watching the total abandon of the &quot;Swinging 60's&quot;, this character of his finds the situation troubling and emotionally dissatisfying.  His commentary isn't sardonic or rude in nature, but it's very obvious he feels a &quot;cold&quot;, loveless relationship (one where he couldn't truly know the answer to his question &quot;How do you feel?&quot;) is not for him.  Note his 1996 solo masterpiece Broken China, where he demonstrates what he's willing to invest in a *true* bond of love.  Also, musically this is an absolutely infectious foot-tapper of a song with beautiful vocals, and naturally it would be Mr. Wright who finds something truly *useful* for this album's horn section to do!  Given his classical and jazz roots, it's no surprise he was able to pull it off.<br />&quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is a pleasant David Gilmour guitar-based piece, which interestingly enough, is the first place we hear the bells that reappear in The Division Bell's &quot;High Hopes&quot;.  While nice to listen to, I must admit it doesn't quite stand out like APB, &quot;Summer '68&quot; and &quot;If&quot;...although when he croons, &quot;Sing to me, sing to me...&quot; I can't help feeling something in my heart.  Overall, I would say AHM is rather underrated, at least...the *band's* contributions to it!
0790729350|3.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was a teen and it practically changed my life. I love this movie because not only did it gave us great music, but it documented real people who attended this incredible event. The cameramen went around filming anything at random. Of course, what was interesting was preserved on the final cut. It was a unique event, and Woodstock the Movie captured its essence and spirit. The multi-angle filming is inventive and clever. It literally compressed a 6 hours movie into 3. There was so much to see and tell, how could one frame capture it all?<br />Now about this director's cut: I was disappointed. I thought it ruined the original's free flowing spirit. Canned Heat is a very good band, but this in-your-face image of the singer was annoying. Who wants to see his sweaty mustache while he's blasting out the blues? Jimi Hendrix's extended piece wasn't that good either. There were some parts of his jam that was monotonous. When Jorma Kaukonen of Jefferson Airplane sang the blues, it was a waste of movie time.  It didn't seem to represent the 60's generation. It wasn't even a classic 60's song. I thought the director added more blues for the sake of appealing to the modern viewers. Instead, he destroyed this &quot;time capsule.&quot; The director should had added more footage of the people rather than adding musicians singing blues.  It just doesn't seem like the 60's anymore.<br />jefferson Airplane and janis joplin were good though. I was happy to see them included. But sometimes it is not a good idea to improve upon a masterpiece. It was good as it is, that is why it won the academy award. It was special. Instead of extending this great movie, the director should create special features with more music, interviews, footages, commentaries, etc. There was absolutely no need to repaint his masterpiece. It's like adding more into the Mona Lisa because the painter got greedy and wanted it to be even better than it already is. <br />For this, I have to give this dvd director's cut 3 stars instead of 5.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Could Blind Guardian ever overcome their previous masterpiece or release something even equally good, most of their fans wondered... And it was 1998's \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" that came to give the answer to that question, proving that when a band is capable and willing, everything is possible. \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" while retaining most of the elements of their previous album, is very different in song structuring and perception than \\"Imaginations from the Other Side\\" .This time the songs have a more symphonic edge to them especially on the vocals. Thus when Hansi sings, hundreds of voices seem to accompany him giving a very majestic feeling to the music. On the other hand, the heavy guitars and the pounding drumming are still a major part of the music enriched with atmospheric keyboards and even pianos on some songs. The album's lyrics are based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book \\"The Silmarillion\\" and thus the very big number of songs on the album as it is a concept album. Between each song there is a narration making the album seem like a sang story. Some of the best moments on the album include the symphonic masterpiece \\"Time Stands Still\\", the title track, \\"Blood Tears\\" and the depressingly beautiful \\"The Eldar\\". Honestly speaking there is not a single weak moment on the album! While this album does not contain the aggressiveness and the anger of \\"Imaginations from the Other Side\\" it's still a very successful follow up to that gem and should be owned by any fans of melodic power metal and intelligent music fans who can see over labels and genres
0393317552|5.0|This book was originally recommened to me by a colleague - a PhD in environmental toxicology and statistics - who said she was intrigued by Diamond's thesis but found the reading &quot;too heavy going&quot; for her. I'm so glad that I kept with it past the first few chapters, because it's a book that rewards the diligent reader with remarkable and provocative answers to the question: &quot;Why are we modern humans one way and not another?&quot;<br />Remarkable and Provocative. It is remarkable how Diamond wields competence in technical fields as diverse and widely separated one from another as linguistics and agriculture, or sociology and animal husbandry. He draws from what appears (to this layman, anyway) to be a sizable swath of modern academic thought in the fields of history, anthropology, horticulture, genetics, lingusitics, sociology, and archeology to make his points. Even more remarkable, in my opinion, is the extent to which Diamond never swerves in guiding the narrative of the book as if he secretly needed to grind one side or another of some particular dogmatic &quot;axe.&quot; Diamond may be the most refershingly honest and starightforward academician writing today; particularly because he doesn't appear to have much of a covert agenda.<br />Provocative and Remarkable. In the end, what is more provocative even than Diamond's thesis is the underlying simplicity of the concepts themselves: continental geogrpahy is the dominant determinant of long-term societal development; original genetic diveristy (both plants and animals) at the continental level outweighs most human efforts to engineer lasting changes to societies. I had the feeling after reading Diamond's book that, &quot;Yeah, I could have figured that out myself if I'd thought about it a lot.&quot; Of course that's silly; I couldn't have even scratched the surface of the puzzle that Diamond tries to crack. But that's the simple beauty of Diamond's thought: after being lead on an enormoulsy entertaining journey through man's history on virtually every continent, one is left with the sense that: &quot;Hey, things do fit toegether after all and they really do make pretty good sense. It's for good reason that we moderns are where we are today.&quot; Maybe equally provocative is the fact that Diamond resists the urge to climb onto a soapbox (or behind a pulpit) and interpret his conclusions in terms of what modern man should do with them to solve modern problems. Spare me! ... and there you go, Diamond does just that.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Reality is still slowly growing on me, but I am impressed by its eclectic quality. To go from the dystopian pop of &quot;New Killer Star&quot; to the epic meditation on death and memory in &quot;Bring Me The Disco King&quot; is no mean achievement for any songwriter, but for a card carrying boring-old-fart like Bowie, as some would have us believe, this is proof that some artists continue to follow their muse regardless of their age. I am sure Bowie has one eye on the forthcoming tour and sales in putting together this record, but then that his part of his genius. He remains one of those great popular artists like Neil Young whose interests take them in and out of the mainstream down into the undergound and back up again. Regardless of the fact that is a the latest Bowie brand product, I just think it is a great pop album...which I will put on my annual best list with the likes of Elephant by The White Stripes. So there, nyaah.
0553212443|5.0|There is no reason to go into the plot or particulars of A Christmas Carol:  I know of no one who is not conversant with it. Almost everyone, from young children to senior citizens, has at least seen it in a screen adaptation. It has become an integral part of the Christmas season, an immortal classic, beloved by both young and old. That said, if you have never read the original text, you owe it to yourself to do so. This story, though short and simple, is a timeless classic for a reason:  it is immaculately written, has a great theme, and is undeniably heartwarming. Dickens is at his brief best here, deftly and skillfully weaving this immortal story in a spellbinding manner, making great and timeless art out of what would have been an overly-sugary-sweet mess in the hands of a lesser writer. This story is good enough, and well-written enough, to melt the cold hard of any cynic. The prose style he uses in this book is just about perfect:  it makes for a fast-paced read which can easily be read in one setting, while also managing to be entertaining, and even suspenseful -- with a fine moral to boot. The story is also more than it seems:  in addition to the simple morality tale, Dickens manages to weave in some social criticism, while also intermixing elements of horror and not a slight bit of humor. This is one of the few books that I truly recommend to everyone. Everyone can read it, and everyone can enjoy it. An essential classic.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|after exploring all of Tool's works and Mer de Noms i understand that this album is just the next step in the journey through the mind which maynard and his friends have helped us through using music as their &quot;tool&quot; in which to do the exploring.  in tool's 46 and 2 he speaks of his &quot;shadow&quot; being the total opposite of everything that one is yet underlying in everything one does. A Perfect Circle is the shadow of Tool and they're doing a magnificent job of blowing the minds of the people who understand the deep subconcious meanings of what they are about and what they are doing. amen
0920668372|5.0|The first time I read this book my son was a collicky baby and all I did was rock him and sing to him.  I cried and cried when I read it as it was so beautiful!  I kept reading it to my son through the twos and it was so true and eventually I didn't cry when reading it.  When my daughter came along I bought her a copy for her own.  I must say that if I take too much time between readings the book gets to me as my children seem to be growing as quickly as the boy in the book.  HOwever, I recommend this book to any mother (a great Christening or baby gift) and sure to bring a smile (if not a few \\"happy\\" tears) to all.  WONDERFUL BOOK!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The guy is just incredible.  The first time I listened to the album I was not impressed and thought it wasn't close to Mer De Noms, but after I listed to it for the 3rd time I was hooked.  The Package, Weak and Powerless, Noose and Pet are all hard hitting (as far as APC goes) and The Outsider is a breakthrough IMO.  This will be the song that makes this album.  My advice to all who buy this CD... Don't give up on it.  LISTEN TO IT 3 TIMES.. and by the 3rd time you will be HOOKED.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Somewhere back in the early 1990's, I thought Iron Maiden had just ran out of fuel. Their albums had become indeed uninteresting and uninspiring and I got the feeling that Steve Harris &amp; Co lost their hunger as well as enthusiasm and creativity. When Maiden released \\"New brave world\\" I didn't even listened to it for a year because I thought it was another weak album. I was wrong! \\"Brave new world\\" was good, so when \\"Dance of death\\" hit the stores I bought it unheard - and I do not regret that.<br />\\"Dance of death\\" is even better than \\"Brave new world\\", mainly because the over all material is stronger. I also believe that with \\"Dance of death\\", Iron Maiden have released their most melodic album ever. It is still heavy metal but many of the former strained vocal arrangements where Bruce Dickinson had to sing along with the music (like Ozzy Osbourne singing \\"Iron man\\" at full speed) have given place to more melodic arrangements. But I do agree with some others that the chorus on many numbers is a bit boring because of one repeating line, like \\"No more lies\\". Still, I think this a very good album and old fans of Maiden shouldn't hesitate to buy \\"Dance of death\\".
B00009V7P8|5.0|O....  The title just states the album.  When you finish the album, which is stunning in its simplicity and, at the same time, its complection, &quot;O&quot; is exactly what you say.  Usually, however, it's quickly followed by a &quot;wow,&quot; &quot;holy cow,&quot; or other such explanation.  The guitar is really wonderful, and the tracks when he has a band backing him up are very tight.  The whole album is incredibly tight, and since it was recorded on a portable 8-track, it has a certain feeling to it that is really... intimate.  Occasionally it sounds like Damien is singing in a small room full of echo, and it seems like he's just sitting there next to you strumming on his guitar.  The tracks are very powerfully emotional, and the only reason it's not as good as he is live is because you can't see his face; however, he puts incredible images in your head, one of which is how he would look singing the song.  Every song has unique character and a feeling all its own.  &quot;O&quot; is a must-buy, the best album of the year thus far.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|As it has been said in previous reviews, do not buy this album if you are expecting another Mer de Noms. The music, sounds, and writing voice on this album differ from Mer de Noms greatly, which will leave most people who are seeking a repeat of the first album disappointed. Perhaps this change is due to the absence of Paz? Perhaps not. I think A Perfect Circle will be one of those bands that is forever changing and testing new horizons of music. This album is merely a reflection of that.<br />While Thirteenth Step sounds little like their first success, it is quite good in its own right. I personally think it blows Mer de Noms away. Maynard (the singer) is there in typical Maynard fashion, but he also challenges himself. I hear him doing things on this album I've rarely heard from him before (ex: where did he get that incredible vocal range?). Where Mer de Noms had almost an oriental feel, this album flows in a very surreal manner. The song \\"Pet\\" talks about \\"the boogymen are coming\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" is just that, beginning with the words \\"go back to sleep.\\"<br />\\"Gravity\\" is perhaps the closest song on here that is true to Mer de Noms fashion. There are two tracks here that are pseudo-songs, and by that I mean they are not what traditionally gets air play and have little vocals: \\"Crimes\\" and the aforementioned \\"Lullaby.\\" I have heard several fans of Failure complain about the cover of \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me.\\" Not having heard the original, I cannot cast a vote either way. I can say, though, that I enjoy listening to this track. It sounds drastically different from anything else on this album, but it is almost like a welcome distraction.<br />I must disagree with the reviewer who said it sounds like Tool's album Lateralus. I believe Maynard adamantly tries to keep Tool's sound different from A Perfect Circle's sound. There wouldn't be much sense in marketing the same style under two different band names. Naturally, since both bands share the same singer/songwriter, there will be some similarities, but there are not enough here to say Thirteenth Step sounds like Lateralus. I got bored with Lateralus after a couple of listens. If you've heard one track on there, you've heard nearly all of them. There is very little variation between songs. Thirteenth Step, however, has a great deal of variation in its music. I've had the album on repeat since buying it the afternoon it came out, and I have yet to tire of it.<br />Individual breakdown of the track listing:<br />1) The Package: *** (three stars out of five)<br />2) Weak and Powerless: *****<br />3) The Noose: *****<br />4) Blue: ***** (though it took awhile to grow on me)<br />5) Vanishing: ****<br />6) A Stranger: ****<br />7) The Outsider: ****<br />8) Crimes: ** (perhaps the worst song on here, in my opinion)<br />9) The Nurse Who Loved Me: ***<br />10) Pet: ***** (tied for best with \\"Gravity\\")<br />11) Lullaby: ***<br />12) Gravity: *****here will be some similarities, but there are not enough here to say Thirteenth Step sounds like Lateralus.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|With the release of Thirteeth Step...A Perfect Circle...made one huge decision to not be pigeonhold in an industry where you either sound like this or that...Not only is it crafted with honesty, paradoxes and downright gutwrenching emotion...it chronicles a rebirth of one of the most valid bands of this century.
B000066C6Z|5.0|\\"Airplane\\" spoofed airplane disaster flicks. \\"The Naked Gun\\" spoofed the Dragnet-type cop movie. \\"Top Secret!\\", lesser known, but just as funny, if not funnier, actually spoofs two genres--the Elvis musical and World War II movies. Somehow, in the absurd universe of Zucker/Abahams/Zucker, these two go hand in hand. The sight gags are nonstop and relentlessly ... hilarious. Val Kilmer has a great knack for the delivery this kind of comedy requires. He also does all his own singing on classics like \\"Straighten the Rug\\", \\"Skeet Surfin'\\", and the hauntingly romantic Macy's Semi-Annual Lincoln's Day Sale jingle, \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\" Other highlights include the long-awaited clarification of the lyrics to the German national anthem, a dedicated band of French resistance fighters, Omar Sharif's brutal initiation into the world of physical comedy, and two of the Zucker Brothers' most inspired set-pieces--one in a Swedish bookstore and the other in an underwater saloon. Just watch.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Californication by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is a return to their past success.  Old guitarist John Frusciante is back and better than ever.    \\"Around the World\\" kicks off Californication with a blast.  Great bass as usual.  One of the best songs on the album.  Great ending.  \\"...Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang...\\" RHCP is the only band that could just do that randomly right in the middle of a chorus.  \\"Parallel Universe\\" has got cool guitar and drums.  A sweet song.  \\"Scar Tissue\\" is one of the most popular songs on Californication.  Nice guitar solos.  \\"Otherside\\" is an amazing song with superb lyrics.  The music video is awesome, by the way.  \\"Get On Top\\" is the most underrated song on Californication.  Excellent drums, vocals, and bass.  \\"Californication\\", along with \\"Otherside\\", \\"Get On Top\\", and \\"Purple Stain\\" make Californication the great CD it is.  \\"I Like Dirt\\" is also very underrated.  No one seems to write about \\"I Like Dirt\\" at all on Amazon.  Nonetheless, it rocks.  Great bass, as usual, and a good ending, as usual.  \\"Purple Stain\\" is a pure RHCP funk song.  It's got cool lyrics that go extremely well with the guitar and bass.  And another fantastic ending!  \\"Right On Time\\" is also very enjoyable.    Sweet album overall.  Glad to see the Peppers are back and rocking.
B000094DUP|5.0|This is truly one of the best pop albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Delta is such an amazing talent and is sure to go along way, especially if she keeps making songs of such a high standard as this. It is rare for me to love an album from the first listen, but I made an exception when it came to Innocent Eyes. The emotion in the songs has the power to move you, especially in Not me, Not I which is one of my favourites along with Lost without you. There is a sincerity in Delta's voice when she sings these songs which you don't hear from other artists like Britney Spears and it really makes you believe what you are hearing.<BR>Then you move along to songs such as Innocent Eyes and Predictable which are more up tempo and a lot of fun. Delta shows the versatility of her talent particularly in the former.<BR>If you only ever buy one pop album, let it be this one, you will not be disappointed.
B00000K2SD|5.0|cool. the world is not what we seam to be. life is run by a computer. peoples minds hooked up to computer. what is real ius un real. cool special effects.
B0000C8AUO|4.0|This album seems to be getting pretty mixed reviews but I think it's rather good.  Anyways, I'm writing about the limited edition 2-disc set.  I love his new version of &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; on the bonus disc -- in fact I may prefer it to the original!  It sounds so fresh and awesome, and I can't stop listening to it!
B000002MFE|5.0|cool guitar, no electricity. coll blues and rock. redid layla. other songs such as tears in heaven slow bluesy and cool. poor beutiful and cool guitar playing.

B00008EY9G|4.0|This film plays out like a typical slasher movie for the first hour, and then comes the inevitable mind-blowing plot twist.  But...<br />The plot twist in this movie is a logical resolution to a believability problem the movie was spiralling into.  The introduction of logic into a movie of this genre is in itself mind-blowing.  For that reason alone, I felt my time was well spent with this movie.  I could relax and let its flaws slip past my attention.  But then...<br />I thought about the movie as a whole, and felt that the plot was still a little ridiculous, but I let it go, because I felt that any movie with a well thought out plot twist deserves some leniency.<br />My only advice is not to watch this movie more than once, because, absent of the shock of the plot twist, this movie is no better than your average slasher movie.
0385504209|1.0|Being a writer myself, I can only surmise that after reading this, and listening to it as an audio book just to make sure I wasn't being unfair, that Dan Brown must have a huge following of fans.  It reads like a first novel, and I am surprised that so many people find it \\"enthralling\\".  The dialogue is horrendous, the narrative is pedestrian, and the writing overall seems remarkably amateurish for a celebrated novelist.  It reads like a book he wrote years ago, hid in a closet, got well known, then brought it out and dusted it off to present it to his agent and publisher.  I wrote better than this when I was in the 3rd grade.  His prediliction to repeat sentences and phrases over and over again is annoying, as if the reader is mentally challenged and didn't get it the first time.  It is an insult to a reader to \\"write down\\" to your audience.  It just goes to show that perserverance pays off in the publishing world.  If any other writer had tried to peddle this manuscript, they would have racked up truckloads of rejection slips, and been told to take elementary writing classes, in addition to \\"get an imagination\\".  This writing is almost as bad as Danielle Steele, another publishing miracle.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Now before you start to think that this is stuff I truly \\"dig\\", hear me out. I believe myself to have very good taste in music.I enjoy a huge variety,and go way back in time to hear out different artists/ and or vocalists. That said, I can't take it all that seriously. Wouldn't you go nuts if all you listened to was deep, emotionally dense, incredible music???Of course you would. However those of us who listen to excepetional music may want to deny it, we all have our guilty little pleasures which we feel we need to deny-well, I'm not going to, at least not anymore.Britney Spears cannot sing to save her life, and her songs are all products of ready-to sell pop, but each and every single one is enjoyable!!While people sit here crying their eyes out screaming \\"she has no talent\\" \\"she's a bad example for young, pre-adolescent girls\\" I'm sitting here getting a kick out this. This is the type of music that is absolutely brainless, and requires you to just keep your ears open. IT's for those times when you don't need to be emotionally or mentally stimulated, when you just need to hear some ear candy which makes the whole world look rosy again. It's like when you don't want to watch good acting, and drama, and choose some brainless fluff, like the \\"Hot Chick\\", for example.Stuff that's so bad it's good. WEll, when I just wanna dance all to myself, I pop this in, and I don't take it seriously, and neither should you.
B000002LTU|2.0|\\"Doo Bop,\\" the final studio album by Miles Davis, is a pretty weird listening experience.  Davis was a free-minded musician who challenged the otherwise strict norms of jazz by fusing it with rock and funk on many of his 1970s releases, so it'd seem inevitable that he would experiment with hip hop rhythms as he does on this album.  But what we get is not a disc that pushes buttons as brazenly as \\"On the Corner\\" or delivers spine-tingling chills like \\"Live-Evil.\\"  Instead, we sadly find Davis (in otherwise good form) caught in a bad brew of generic drum samples, dated production, and clumsy rhymes.  The CD sounds rather impersonal; as if Davis and the rest of the musicians recorded their bits in separate studios. But Miles himself is hardly to blame for this mess.  The fault lies mainly on collaborator Eazy Mo Bee, whose contribution to this album does Davis no justice.  One track on \\"Doo Bop\\" does work: the opener \\"Mystery,\\" a seductive groove of downtempo heaven that really brings out the best in Miles's trumpeting.  But the rest of the disc collapses like a house of cards.  Younger crowds may dig it, but more diehard and older fans will instantly notice the secondhand feel of the material.  Still, all legends are allowed at least one subpar album, and for Miles Davis, \\"Doo Bop\\" is it.
0140195076|5.0|This is a book I use daily in my study of Jyotish (the astrology of India), as well as in more clearly discerning my clients' evident and also more hidden talents, possibilities and challenges in my work as a life coach.  Firmly established within the growing collection of  erudite and excellent books on Indian astrology and other Vedic vidyas (traditional sciences) by Robert E. Svoboda and Hart deFouw, this volume sets the benchmark for the kind of resource one will want to use over a lifetime.  <br />_Light on Life_ is the original kind of \\"hypertext\\" book - not in a literal sense, but because its thousands of key insights perpetually inform one another as the attentive reader is guided in his or her ability to stitch concepts like threads back and forth across distinct but interrelated themes.  For this reason, the contents of the book become nearly endless in their immediate richness, and yet the *implications* of the astrological concepts the book proffers and demonstrates for all facets of experience, secular and spiritual, simply *are* endless.<br />There will indeed be some percentage of readers for whom this is a good place to begin Vedic astrological studies.  But I think generally if one carefully reserves this volume as one's second or third book on Jyotish, the educational dividends will be far greater. The Jyotish worldview will change your life, doubtless, and some will advocate simply diving in, in which case if you make this book the equivalent of your Bible or overall intellectual and spiritual companion -- and also treat it as the textbook for a class you have to pass -- over the course of, say, the span of a semester, it will likely bear fruit.  However, there are alternate paths that include the same long-term relationship without that immediate commitment! I feel odd writing these words because I in no way want to diminish my praise.  deFouw and Svoboda are among my favorite authors, period. (By the way, please note that Svoboda is a full co-author and not merely a contributor.) Nonetheless, since this book is for me unequivocally a powerful dose or very rich meal, to invoke just a couple of images, I do not think all will benefit from simply a sample from its pages.  It somehow does not encourage such sampling for the really raw beginner-- and yet other *equally valuable* primers indeed do permit such sampling, toe-dipping, etc. with no loss to the full experience.  I say all this simply based on my own experience and that of many friends and associates in the Vedic astrological community.  There is no hierarchy here, no affront to either _Light on Life_ or its alternatives as choices for first books.  The choices are just elementally different, different kinds of entities or beings.<br />_Light on Life_'s sections on nakshatras (lunar mansions); bhava (house), graha (planet) and rashi (constellation or \\"sign\\") significations; numerous and thorough traditional taxonomies that group many sectors of phenomena and experience in categories according to the authority of nakshatra, rashi, graha, etc.; and absorbing and instructive case studies of well-known subjects comprise some of the best pages you will read on Jyotish anywhere.  **This material will enrich and deftly partner with any other superb books and articles you may possess on Vedic Astrology (e.g., the contemporary writings of Sanjay Rath, Sat Siri Khalsa, Ernst Wilhelm and William Levacy to name just a few; older modern standards by, say, B.V. Raman and K.S. Krishnamurti; and naturally classics such as the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, the Brihat Jataka, etc.)**  <br />In few words, this is one you should get your hands on -- it has gone out of print in the past, so snatch it up now -- even if you heed my advice and get to it after building a simple foundation elsewhere.
0425152251|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Not a fiction, however if you want a book can be fun and enrich your life-get one immediately. This book is listed for teen-readers which can be a mislead. It can be a book for a talent teen 14 years or older to old guy older than me. I am a science major middle age person with a graduate degree. Like most people, I learned all the great names as general terms however never understand who they really are-like Plato, Aristotle, even common term like Materialism, Communism, etc. I tried to read philosophy books before and gave them up (most of them are boring and so hard to understand.) I had one philosophy class in college and could not even understand what the instructor wanted to say. This book brings you into a sea of philosophy knowledge with enough fiction to keep your interest. With all these, who cares that it may have a couple of faults on philosophy terms or it may skip a couple of important philosophers or the story parts is not perfect as some reviewers suggested. Please read this book even just for the purpose of showing off at lunch (I did it and they thought I was so knowledgeable:)) It can be one of the most important books you read in your life. A great book for a regular person without much philosophy.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|Coming from a true-blue E.B. fan.......she could've done a lot better.  Don't get it twisted, I'm sure Erykah left commercial artists such as Ashanti and Mya's mouth watering with desire to perform like her.  Worldwide Underground didn't represent Erykah's free spirit and animated abilities.  I would've preferred to hear her voice belting poetic justices rather than overrated musical effects.  &quot;Danger&quot; has GOT to be the hottest song of 2003-2004.  She keeps it all the way real by not letting the legacy of &quot;Other Side of the Game&quot; die.  E.B. showed her assets as usual.  I just expected a lot more energy.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death continues where Brave New World left off and then take a slightly different course. Its a great album, perhaps the best since Seven Son of a Seventh Son, but with a ferw changes it could have been even better. That said my review will still sound negative, but there are reasons...<br />1. Wildest Dreams. Pleasant radio friendly bubblegum metal. Skip.<BR>2. Rainmaker. Would make a much better single, very catchy, great solos.<BR>3. No More Lies. Epic. Powerful delivery of chorus just about compensates for the repetition. This is the one song on the album for which that the bass intro seems natural.<BR>4. Montsegeur. Classic Maiden metal. First rate.<BR>5. Dance of Death. Remove first 3 minutes and its excellent. Second half of the song is about the only time the 3 guitars work - great stuff. What awful lyrics.<BR>6. Gates of tomorrow. OK filler.<BR>7. New frontier. Better filler, still nothing special.<BR>8. Paschendale. Wow. Worth the price of the CD alone. Quite simply the best piece of metal in 20 years. Stunning.<BR>9. Face in the Sand. Ruined by that all too familiar bass guitar intro. Skip that and its a smoldering winner.<BR>10. Age of innocence. Album should have ended by now. Filler.<BR>11. Failed but genuine attempt at progression. Doesn't quite work, reminds me of Prodigal Son on Killers.<br />Sounds pretty negative? Well here's more: <br />Bass and drums are lower in the mix and the guitars generally higher than past albums- this really helps the sound, but too much orchestration spoils the effect. Used more sparsely it would embellish as opposed to becoming the norm. Surely you can get enough out of 3 guitars to render this unneccessary.<br />Please no more bass guitar intros. One per album may have a positive effect but the same thing on practically every song shows a lack of ideas.<br />So all that criticism and still four stars? Actually the biggest improvement they could make would be to cut ten minutes off the album. Paschendale is worth 8 minutes - its worth 20! Shave off some intros, ditch some of the fillers and this would be a classic. As it stands, its just great.
B000005IRG|4.0|Yeah , it's a good disc but the double live &quot;The Blow Up&quot; is fantastic.  If you are unfamiliar with the band , introduce yourself with something powerful and unforgetable , &quot;The Blow Up!!&quot;
B0000035GN|5.0|One of Sebadoh's best. This is a must have album.
B000099T2L|1.0|Ok. There's a very simple reason why the first two singles off this CD had guest appearences by other artist: She can't hold a song on her own without needing someone to back her up. That's also the reason why her video's have so much &quot;schmaltz&quot; in them, her scantily clad, writhing body with that hair that seems to go on forever. Backround dancers in a similar state. That's what we call substance at this point.<br />Regarding her voice, my dad put it perfectly. She sounds like she has all the training of a teenage girl singing in front of her mirror. Still at least she tries, which is more than I can say for Ashanti who hides the inadaquecies in her voice with layers of backround vocals (Sorry, I wanted to get two reviews in at once.)<br />All in all I am not impressed by this or anything else she has EVER done! I don't wish to offend anyone I am just voicing an opinion.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When i first got this album i listened to it three times over.  From beginning to end and the first time i listened to the album i fell in love with the music and it just grew everytime i listened to it after that. I dont really care what anyone else says this is an amazing album, The Noose is i believe my favorite song its just so beautiful it moves you. The general mood of the whole album is so much darker than Mer De Noms but yet extremely well balanced. I couldnt even begin to express how much i love this album even with a maximum of a 1,000 words i could go on and rant about this album till the early hours of the morning but im not going to.  The music does the talking for me.
0385504209|1.0|If you couldn't figure out the codes in this book within seconds, I have one word (if it is a word) to say to you: DUUUUUHHH!!!!!<br />I felt that Brown insulted my intelligence all the way through this book, not to mention that he cribbed all his 'conspiracy theory' plot lines from two books, &quot;The Templar Revelation&quot; and &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail.&quot;  The characters are third-rate stale mystery stereotypes: the studious yet manly professor type (hello Indiana Jones?) the bereft yet beautiful French orphan girl (who is supposed to be a London-trained cryptologist but can't solve even the simplest backwards-writing code), the albino monk (haven't we picked on albinos enough?), the diabolical Catholic Church officials, honest to God this is character/plot workmanship right out of Mystery Writing 102-- Course Designed for Pretentious Art History Geeks.  If you want to get your jollies from some REAL Art History Porn, go for Simon Schama's &quot;Rembrandt's Eyes.&quot;  It's the real deal.<br />The only reason I'm getting so excercised about this is because this book is a bestseller and some people actually think it's good.  Have we lost all sense of incisive criticism?  Liberal Arts majors -- speak out against this travesty.  Take back the historical novel, and preserve its integrity for future generations!  Tell people the truth -- this book is rank.<br />Thank you.<br />Oh, I did get past the first 10 pages because the author mentioned my alma mater, American University in Paris.  But that's the only good thing...
0393057658|1.0|There is a saying &quot;If you torture the data long enough, you can get it to admit to anything&quot;. Michael Lewis starts with the premise that Billy Beane is the best and smartest GM in baseball, then butchers the statistics to make it seem so.It's simple, the A's don't win so many games with a minimal payroll because of their on base pct. or because Billy Beane outsmarts his fellow GM's constantly. They win because they drafted (before Beane) three of the best youngs starting pitchers in baseball.A fact that gets amazingly little mention in the book.<br />Predictions:A) When Zito, Mulder, and Hudson become free agents; Beane will will become a free agent right along with them and leave. B)When the before mentioned pitchers leave, the A's will stink, no matter how many pitches Scott Hatteberg takes.
0452282152|5.0|I read this book in one afternoon and was completely engrossed with it.  The story at first appears to be a simple one of a maid coming to live with the household of Johannes Vermeer, but it reveals itself to be full of twists of emotion and complex human relationships.  The author did a great job of blending fact and fiction and making it into a fascinating story.
B00009M97Z|3.0|For someone known mainly as a supermodel and arm candy to rock stars,Carla Bruni is actually a pretty good singer/songwriter/guitarist. The songs sound very much like lite,poppy french folk-style music. Her voice is soft and soothing,very relaxing,and her guitar work is very proficient,but does not show much range. You hear the potential,but in this album it is played safe. Overall,very good for someone with no formal training in singing,guitar,or song-writing. Good for lazy sunday afternoons even for those who do not speak or understand french. Catchiest tune is the first song. It has smooth and quick linguistic connectivity and fine guitar work.
B000068MKZ|5.0|I heard this album when i was working in France this summer, and absolutely adored it. Her voice is so unusual, but it works really well with the simple music. The beauty is that even if you don't understand the lyrics, the songs are still enchanting and you can listen to it over and over.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|This collection is builds on and further extends the wide and deep repertoire of Bowie. Instant hits (Days) evoke classics like &quot;Occasional Dream&quot; &amp; &quot;Without You&quot;, with touches of &quot;Hours&quot; and &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;.  &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, &quot;Never Get Old&quot;, and &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;, &quot;Looking for Water&quot; are priceless gems and evoke elements of &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, &quot;Earthling&quot;, and &quot;Station to Station&quot;, and &quot;Let's Dance&quot; while incorporating Bowie's limitless creativity. &quot;She'll Drive the Same Car&quot; hints at &quot;Always Crashing in the Same Car&quot;/&quot;Joe the Lion&quot;, while &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot; evokes &quot;Heroes&quot; as well as some of his more recent work. &quot;Try Some Buy Some&quot; is a beautiful ballad hinting back at the Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane days. &quot;Reality&quot; is a rocker that incorporates a little of everything Bowie has ever done and then some - priceless. &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot; could have been on &quot;Outside&quot; if it had conceptually fit.<br />Be sure to get the limited edition bonus track extra CD - the 2002 version of &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; is pure joy. Other bonus tracks &quot;Fly&quot; and &quot;Queen of Tarts&quot; are classic Bowie pop/rock.<br />This album is a huge accomplishment, like a retrospective with all new material that incorporates every tool at Bowies disposal. I can't stop listening to it (kind of scary).
0972169504|5.0|I especially suggest this book to people thinking about taking the PhD route.  Read it before making a decision.  Twice.  Then, if you decide to go for it anyways, don't come crying to me when you finally realize that the thing you call your daily life is actually the raw material for one of the funniest comic strips around.  And, believe me when I say Jorge is a funny guy but he doesn't really exaggerate that much, which makes the whole book more funny ( and kinda sad, too ).  In any case, this is the second funniest thing I have read during the last couple of years.  So, get it!<br />Oh, curious about the funniest thing?  My lame attempts at writing drafts for my thesis introduction, of course, what else?

B00008JLKL|5.0|Era continues walking through the road of success ! This album rocks! It keeps up with the same level of superiority as the previous albums.<br />(The Mass) is actually a combination of the song (Divano) of the previous album (Era 2) and (O Fortuna) for Carl Orff. I find it better than the original Divano.<br />(Looking for something) is good too.  I like the choir in addition to our vocalist Lena Jinnegren, mixed with the fast beat.<br />(Don't go away) have a very strong emotional effect, not to mention the beautiful voice of Lena Jinnegren.<br />(Don't you forget) gives a true meaning for closeness &amp; support. 2 English kids (a boy &amp; girl) promise that they'll always be there for each other. The music and lyrics, performed by Lena Jinnegren, will touch your soul.<br />(If you shout) is my favorite song! It's the best: the music, the fast beat, the choir, and our vocalist Lena Jinnegren. Basically EVERYTHING! (If you shout long enough, you'll survive the noise of chaos. If you shout long enough, you will be the one.)<br />(Avemano orchestral) is an orchestral version of the original (Avemano) of the first album (Era). I think it's much better than the original one. I wish it was in the first album.<br />(Enae volare) is a remix of the original song (Enae volare mezzo) of the first album (Era). To tell you the truth, I liked the original song.<br />(Sombre day) is a relaxing classical music (no choir). During meditation, it will take you beyond the space &amp; time!<br />(Voxifera) and (Champions) are one of my best songs. They have marshal beats and excellent music background, with a highly professional choir.<br />The only flaw of this album is the remix of 3 songs, while we expected 3 more NEW songs in the new album. However, 2 songs were well-remixed.<br />(Era The Mass) will enchant you as it did to me! You will easily fell in love with it!  Waiting for the next album.
B00008EY9G|4.0|This movie, starring John Cussack, takes place mostly within the mind of a character who is an accused killer.  This is not evident in the film until there is a switch in scene to the criminal defendant and his legal and psychiatric team.  This makes the film intriguing, and sets the stage for the search for the true killer within the personality &quot;alters&quot; of the main drama.  This leads to a surprise ending, which may not be too surprising to those familiar with real life multiple personality and dissociative identity cases and mind control programming.  This film has a solid plot and convincing performances, and should be a delight for those who are bored by happy endings.
038572179X|5.0|At first I wasn't sure how I would react to this story, but what a story it is!  The first section of the book that details the happenings of a summer night in 1935 is absolutely riveting.  It manages to do it even thuogh it is very hard to find a true hero or heroine in the book. The night is a tragic one that leads to false accusations of rape against an innocent man.  The rest of the book deals with the aftermath of the evening for many decades.<br />As the story moves on to World War II and beyond, the story becomes grittier and it eventually challenges you to think about a number of basic values. Values regarding family, relationships and the ability to move on from injustice.<br />It's a sad book but it will move you to think even though it takes a few pages to get hooked.  Once you meet the main characters and get to the first part of the action, you will find it impossible to put down.
0385504209|2.0|After giving in to the hype and reading this book, I frankly don't understand what all the fuss was about.  The allegations about the Catholic Church aren't shocking to anyone who's read _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_, or the better follow-up _The Woman with the Alabaster Jar_; what *is* shocking is that Brown presents this interesting if flawed speculative history as if it were verified fact.  There's enough actual evidence of the Church's ugly political machinations and lethal intolerance and misogyny to power any number of thrillers without having to resort to invention, but I digress.  Brown seeds the story with just enough facts that the half-truths, misleading statements, and pure fictions go down in the same gulp, and while that's certainly no crime -- this is a suspense novel, after all -- he then tries to endow it all with the odor of historical sanctity, but there's another aroma overpowering.<br />As for the story itself... eh. It clipped along at a decent pace, but again, knowing the conspiracy theory in advance rendered the plot utterly predictable.  Then there's Brown's gifts as a prose stylist, which are, to be charitable, crushingly mediocre.  But by far the most irritating aspect of the book, for me, was Brown's treatment of Sophie.  After a promising entrance (springing Langdon from a trap in the Louvre), she becomes no more than a listening post and token love interest.  The scenes where she sits around, silent, while a bunch of *men* lecture her about The Suppression of the Divine Feminine were unintentionally hilarious.  In fact, were there any other women in this novel?  Liberate the Mother, indeed.
B00008IAMD|5.0|Johnny Cash's music resonates through many genres, and this album is no exception.  &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; hold even more meaning with his recent passing, and he does justice to the songs that he covered on the rest of the album.<br />The video for &quot;Hurt&quot; was eerily poignant to watch after June Carter Cash's passing in May, because it was as if she was watching over him in death as she did in life.  It is one of the most stunning, emotional pieces of film I have ever seen.  His rendition of the song is nothing but raw emotion.<br />Though he was frail and getting on in years, Mr. Cash was a wonderful musician, and he will not be forgotten.  I encourage you to buy this CD, but also to check out his earlier works.  You will not be disappointed.  There will NEVER be another Man in Black.<br />RIP Johnny Cash.
B00005BCPC|1.0|The movie itself is quite entertaining in modern standards, but it is hardly based on Jane Austen's book. Unlike Austen's main character, Fanny is a bold, loud, playful girl, flirting in the hallways of her uncle's home. Her uncle is a mean-spirited and harsh man, almost never like Austen's Sir Thomas. The other characters are no more like the book in character or looks. The dialogues are modified to sound modern. There is undue physical contact between Fanny and Mr. Crawford and, worse yet, between Fanny and Edmund. A key character is eliminated, Fanny's brother William, who is her only joy in life outside of her uncle's home. He is replaced by a sister, who is attached to Fanny too early in the film. The characters, if separated completely from the book, are in themselves charming. The movie would have been a nice American piece of drama had they called it another name. As it stands, it does great injustice to Jane Austen genius.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|As I sit here listening to this CD, I find it hard not to shed a few tears.  In light of Mr. Cash's recent passing, most of the songs on this album resonate with meaning, particularly \\"We'll Meet Again\\", \\"The Man Comes Around\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\".<br />He turns Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" into a deeper testament of faith in God, and his version of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\" has, in my opinion, eclipsed the original.  The video is one of the most stunning pieces of film I have ever witnessed.  It is hauntingly beautiful, and made more poignant after June Carter Cash's death in May; as she watched over him from the staircase, it was as if she was looking down on him from Heaven.  Now it seems they are together, making sweet beautiful music.<br />His covers of \\"popular\\" artists only prove that Johnny Cash crosses all genres of music, and his legacy as one of the greatest musical artists of all time will live on forever.  I urge you to pick up this CD as well as his earlier works.  You will not be disappointed!<br />RIP Johnny Cash.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I've been waiting for this film to hit DVD for a long time.  I saw it in high school in 1979 and enjoyed the passion and energy of the movie right up to the final arresting image.  I saw that the DVD wasn't completely loaded with the extras the film deserves, but I was still there to buy it immediately.<br />I liked the Roy Scheider commentary and wished there was more.  There are great clips of Scheider in character commenting during production and a series of clips of Fosse himself directing the opening &quot;cattle call&quot; sequence (the real &quot;Joe Gideon&quot; at work!).  For a very surreal moment, listen to Scheider's commentary for the final death dance sequence where Fosse tells him, &quot;They've all forgiven me!&quot;<br />Hopefully, as the film is rediscovered by a new generation of fans (the CHICAGO phenom has to help), a special edition that includes more of Fosse's life and background information will come out.  I'll buy that one too.  ALL THAT JAZZ has what so many films are missing these days: a personal vision unafraid to bare its soul.  I remember Fosse took a lot of flack for his &quot;ego&quot; back in 1979, but the honesty and boldness of his vision remains.
B000059TEP|5.0|This movie, by far, is one of my absolute favorites.  Regardless of how many times I see it, I ALWAYS cry at the end! SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!
B000005HLV|5.0|I just love Cursed in Eternity, the drums are superior, the riffs are sick, and the vocals are echoing from the abyss. That shift to the blast beat always leaves me with an evil grin on my face.<BR>But the album is great. The groundbreaking albums of any genre should always be mandatory listening for anyone who isn't deaf.
0553579908|5.0|The second part of George R. R. Martin's saga, _A Clash of Kings_ is an astounding continuation of _A Game of Thrones_ but also a breath-taking literary masterpiece of its own. Before approaching it, though, you would do well to read the first book: although I have to give Martin credit for giving brief explanations in the beginning that would account for some of the characters and action in the second part, it's impossible to grasp _A Clash of Kings_ in all its magnitude without having read the first part of the saga beforehand.<br />A boy kings sits in the Iron Throne surrounded by a cohort of Lannisters trying to preserve his feeble reign over a kingdom thorn by wars and bloodshed. With two Baratheon brothers questioning his right, the Stark heir ruling the North in the name of its people and a turn-cloak prince fighting for yet another king's claim, the Seven Kingdoms are bleeding worse than ever: death and plunder, atrocities and suffering, and approaching winter threatening to last a generation, coming with its own dangers and unspoken horrors. Black sorcery and out-of-legend cold creatures emerge to devour the realm of men, while a young girl, the mistress of the last living dragons in the world, makes her way through blood and fire to reclaim her father's throne. The blood-red comet that shone in the sky and drew ominous predictions was left unheeded; the terrors it warned of are free to loom over the realm of men. <br />The book starts with a riveting prologue that throws the reader in a new dimension, more mystic than one would have suspected. The rest of the book lives up to the promise of the first pages. Graphic, realistic, convincing in more ways than one, it reaches out of the pages, grabs your brains and squeezes tightly...and you're hooked. Page after page, you will most likely complete the entire thing (which, be warned, approximates 1000 pages) in a heartbeat. It presents a series of betrayals and unexpected friendships, and a world where the closest of allies could turn against you, and the seemingly vilest become your friends. More kings and more violence than a kingdom can bear, and way more dynamism than you've ever seen in a fantasy book. Martin is a master of details-compelling, overpowering details-when he needs to, but he also shrewdly changes the speed of narration to build up suspense. He also continues the successful practice to tell his narrative from the points of view of those characters that survived in _A Game of Thrones_, and adds a few new ones, that come as a pleasant and refreshing surprise, and come to play essential roles in the plot. True to his promise in the first part, Martin continues to build understandable and very human characters that you can feel with and relate to. <br />The complexity of the book is sometimes impossible to grasp, and I cannot begin to think what sort of suprahumanly imagination Martin must have to create it. Magic, one of the most important elements of the fantasy genre that seemed to lack in the first part, is now returning to the Seven Kingdoms, with dragons coming back to life and also mystic sorcery that accounts for a few of the numerous shockingly unanticipated twists in the plot. This renders _A Clash of Kings_ more than a mere tale of medieval tradition. Although, to be sure, the political element is overwhelmingly present, and shrewd and unexpected moves give the reader further delight at this wonderful work. An absolutely thrilling masterpiece and a great continuation to what promises to be the greatest phenomenon in the genre after The Lord of the Rings. Five stars to this one without the slightest hesitation!!!
B0000DBJDL|5.0|I don't own the DVD yet but from the VHS I can tell you that this is the best live material from Floyd. The band at their best moment: Esotheric, cosmic, magical, epic and glorious... this is the Floyd we like.  We need more like this... why they don't release Atom, Piper and Animals Live too?<br />Tracks include live material from Meddle and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\".<br />If you want to buy just one DVD from Floyd, this is the one, the best of them all.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|I'm surprised by the number of people that think DOD is great.  As far as Maiden goes, it's average.  And some of the songs are downright silly.  Dance of Death for one.  I haven't heard such silly lyrics since . . . well, Spinal Tap.  <br />\\"And you my love, won't you take my hand. We'll go back in time to that mystic land. Where the dew-drops cry and the cats meow, I will take you there, I will show you how. And oh how they danced, the little children of Stonehenge, beneath the haunted moon, for fear that the daybreak might come too soon...\\" -Spinal Tap<br />\\" And I felt I was in a trance. And my spirit was lifted from me <BR>And if only someone had the chance. To witness what happened to me. And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them. All had death in their eyes. Lifeless figures they were undead all of them. They had ascended from hell.\\" -Maiden<br />These lyrics could be from the same song . . . <BR>OK, take out Dance of Death and the remaining music is better than Brave New World.  But if you try to compare this to Powerslave . . . well, you can't.  Powerslave is a classic and DOD will only ever be just average music.  . . . I just don't understand why everyone thinks this is so good.  Listen a little more closely and forget that it's Maiden.  If anyone else would have put this stuff out, it would be lost to the bargain bins in a couple of weeks.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you are looking for a Tool record or even a repeat of A Perfect Circle's first record, you will be a bit disappointed with this one.  Remember that Billy didn't write ALL the songs this time, and it's been almost four years since MDN was written.  Of course they will sound different now.<br />And if they didn't, that's what you would all be complaining about.  <br />Just listen to it without a comparison in back of your mind.
0688163173|5.0|Never read this author before, but was pleasantly surprised.  The writing is vivid enough to picture most of this story.  The story was quite good.  I certainly didn't expect the story to turn down that path.  Very creative and something different to read.  Much better than those tired old &quot;formula&quot; novels.  I highly recommend.
1400049628|5.0|I found this guide to be of use in an ongoing investigation of a friend, who I suspect could actually be a real zombie.  All questions have been answered, I now know what to do.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I bought this having not seen it in the theatre.  I was procrastinating on watching it because I was not sure what to expect.  If you've done this also, let me inform you that you've made a big mistake.  Wonderful casting, detailed costumes, riveting music, luscious sets and academy award winning acting.  The performances in this film are excellent.  Each person performs their own musical numbers and it is incredible to watch.  Very sexy indeed!  <br />The special features include an audio commentary track which is very interesting and feature length.  It has a deleted musical number and behind-the-scenes featurette.  I was concered about buying this per the fear of \\"purchasing and having a 2-disc edition come out\\" would strike again.  The features here are worth your money, even if another edition should hit the shelves.<br />113 minutes of pure brilliance.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|well, the first single off the album &quot;weak and powerless&quot; was not to amazing to me, didn't quite do it, but i was a fan of APC for a long time...so, before the cd came out i went to their concert...and, wow, it blew me away, and they played some other songs off the new cd, and they were great, i was thinking of them for weeks, and waiting for this cd, and when i finally go to hear it, i was impressed.  And, i do admit that you have to listen to the cd a couple of times, but once you know where is its going, and what Maynard is saying, then you are hooked...overall it flows great, and the songs indivdually work also...its just a GREAT cd...i recommend it to anyone!
B00005JKHN|5.0|What a nice restoration job was done when transfering this to DVD.  It is sharp and beautiful.  The audio is outstanding as well.  The film is as vibrant as the outer packaging is and the special features only enhance the value of this wonderful DVD.  A true classic and suitable for even the smallest children.<br />These releases are great and you should collect them all because at some point they won't be there any more unless you want to pay big bucks on e-bay.  Things this wonderful never last.  Purchase it now.  If you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself and your child to own it.<br />Amazing...!!!...
B000000OPW|5.0|Okay, I am not a vampire or any other permutation of g-g-goth. But I have always really respected Siouxsie since the early 80's (okay, I'm also pretty old), ever since I first picked up The Scream, which is another great album.<br />Tinderbox is a genre-bending piece of work, and like too many such works, will probably go unrecognized as such by... those who &quot;recognize&quot; this kind of thing. Sure, if you like spooky content, it's all there: death, deals with death, unconditional death, and worse-than-death represent in force. But what makes me check in with this disc again and again -- and it has been a regular, unpredictable guest in my playlist since 1986 -- is that thing about certain albums/discs/recordings that haunt, tease and compel you to keep listening, or to throw it on in the background during those anti-social times when you need something unique to keep you on your toes.<br />What I can say is that this album has, pound for pound, some of the best and most original guitar-playing on it that I have heard; that the disc is incredibly consistent and sustains a black, silky mood from beginning to end; and yet it is because of the blackness that it is, in the end, so compelling and fulfilling. How much more black could this be? None. None more black (-Nigel Tufnel).
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i enjoy this album more then the first. &quot;the noose&quot;, &quot;the stranger&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;pet&quot; and &quot;the outsider&quot; are all unbelievable song. and the cover of failure's &quot;the nurse who loved me&quot; took a good song and made into something incredible. (their sound doesn't relate alot to perfect circle, but i would recomend checking out failure's &quot;fantastic planet&quot; album. i've enjoyed it for years)<BR>the album plays through very smoothly. mixed and arranged wonderfully. a true work of art.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Had'nt ever really heard all of this record until recently (after seeing the band do some of the tunes live the last few years). Back in the 70's it was known as the the record that drove Wakeman out of the band, was very long, had gotten a lot of negative press, and even turned off some of their fans. It had a really cool cover, but how good could it be? it was time to cast aside the preconceptions and give this record a listen. From the live performances I knew I'd like this. This is the one for serious Yes heads, its their most spacey album. Its kind of like a longer spacier close to the edge. I like most all of it especially \\"revealing science of god\\". If Wakeman was not excited about the project, his performance sure does'nt show it..he does some excellent work here, particularly his use of the Mellotron. Some of the most beautiful passages they ever recorded, with soaring vocal harmonies.The studio versions have more of the detail and structure of the songs (theres a great live take of \\"revealing\\" on \\"keys to ascension\\"). As mentioned, good job on the sound and packaging too...except WEA manufacturing made these discs too damm skinny..feels like its gonna break off the spindle, talk about greed. The bonus tracks will be of interest to collectors...that and the good mastering will make it very desirable for Tales heads. New fans who have seen their recent shows should get it too. The 13 year old kid sitting next to me at the Radio city performance told me it's his favorite. I did'nt have the patience when I was 13. Its one of my favorites now too. If you've got the time, Yes has the Tales. This record takes you on a journey like no other Yes album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've been a TOOL fan for many many years, and as much as I liked A Perfect Circle's first album Mer de Noms, it always seemed a LITTLE bit like &quot;TOOL part 2&quot; to me.  When I first listened to this album, I was very impressed and pleasantly surprised.  They really have moved away from the sound of their first album and began to create a sound for themselves, and escape the connection to TOOL (due to Maynard being in both bands.)  Every track on this album is really top notch, I think (with Blue being my favorite at the moment... but, usually my early on favorite song never ends up being my all time favorite song.)  The Package, A Stranger, and the cover of Failure's song The Nurse Who Loved Me are also high up on the list at the moment.  This is (as far as I'm concerned) the rock album of the year, and a strong contender for overall album of the year. Just great.  Really.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Does Maynard know bad music? I think not. This CD has to be the most personal I've heard from him yet, not to mention the most vocally challenging. Billy Howerdels guitar work is so smooth and colorful it wont leave my head! The rest of the bands contributions can also be heard in certain parts of the CD(NIN anybody? Listen to &quot;Crimes&quot;). The darkest beauty imaginable is the only way to describe this melodic masterpeice.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|.....for uninspiring music.  What is this?  The entire album is very repetitive and lacks any emotion or musical qualities that the first album offered.  I can't believe the same musicians made this????  <br />Yes, it's soft.  I have no issues with that.  But all the songs lack any qualities that grab your attention.  It's like they were zombies while making the music.  Going through motions.  The woman from the first album isn't in the band any longer.  Maybe she had artistic input that is sorely lacking now?  Either way, this is awful.  This whole whispering thing is irritating.....and songs which are short still contain fluff.  The complaints I have with this music are very similar to issues I have with Tool's &quot;Lateralus.&quot;  Interesting........<br />Don't buy it.
B0000AM6K2|1.0|This album has been a huge disappointment for me.  I have been a Josh Rouse fan for a long time.  This 'concept' album is far away from &quot;Dressed Up Like Nebraska&quot; - in writing and especially music. Why go to lounge disco Josh? Why? What's up with that?

B00008DDHZ|2.0|While an overview of what happened in 1972 and a well-made film, this film will also serve to needlessly add fuel to the fire for the misinformed Irish-Americans that feel support for the terrorist of the IRA and Sinn Fein are somehow 'patriotic.'<br />What happened in 1972 has SO little to do with the true Irish problem as it exists today- which is Irish Catholics vs. Irish protestants and engrained hatred of each other.<br />Supporting the IRA and Sinn Fein does NOT promote peace or loyalty to Ireland, it promotes and endures the civil war going on their between two extremist groups. The supporters of the IRA and Sinn Fein in America (thankfully a dwindling group) shouldn't flatter themselves to think that anyone in the UK has an interest in keeping Northern Ireland.<br />It's a major, draining inconvenience to the British who sadly still need to remain there at the SPECIFIC REQUEST of the Irish Protestants who are entitled to protection from becoming a Socialist state and total eradication from Ireland simply for being Protestant. Call it what it is- preventing the IRA's Final Solution....
B00006RCSR|5.0|I saw the VHS and I loved it!!! I think it's the only good movie Drew Barrymore has ever done as an adult. My favorite seen is when then the gypsy told her she could only take what she could carry. Then she threw the prince over her shoulder. Great stuff!!!
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|This album is nothing like Mer de Noms.  Others may not mind that so much but if you are like me and loved &quot;Judith&quot; and the other rockers from Mer de Noms, you will more than likely be dissapointed.  This album is very slow and somewhat depressing.  The vocals of Keenan and Howerdel are nothing compared to those on Mer de Noms.  They just seem so boring here.<BR>There is no standout on this album.  All songs are slow and boring.  I have listened to it five times to make sure I do not love it since I loved Mer de Noms and have loved everything by Tool but I still must say that I do not like it at all.  I certainly respect the members of A Perfect Circle in their decision to make an album so different from the previous, I just do not like the direction they took.<BR>It will probably still be in the rotation for the simple fact that I love Keenan's voice but it will never be played as much as Mer de Noms.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I know it is a bold statement, but I mean it!<br />The Martix trilogy is the Star Wars for our genration. Look at all the similarties in the starwars and the matrix movies. But the Matrix Reloaded did everything Lucas did with Empire Strikes Back, but 100 times better (I dont mean speical effects). The ending to the Matrix Reloaded was one of the bet I have ever seen. So what it leaves it open. But I garuntee it will become a famous ending (Like star wars emipre strikes back) that will talked about for 100 years.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|This cd lacks anything outstanding. Musically they havnt<BR>tried anything new.<BR>Maynard sounds like Cher now, gone are the days of him<BR>holding a scream or tone for 10's of seconds on ends.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|First of all, in reading some of the other reviews it seems like most folks aren't grasping that 'WorldWide Underground' is only an EP.  Hence the short length (8 tracks) and low price.<br />Creatively it's a bit of a departure for Ms. Wright but make no bones about it, 'WU' is unmistakably a Badu joint.  Besides, if I have to hear the overexposed Ashanti or the charisma-less Lumidee one more time, I'm going to eat my computer.  Anything from Erykah is a breath of fresh air, luckily this time around that breath contains moments of pure brilliance.<br />I was tempted, at first, to say &quot;Danger&quot; may be her best song ever.  Well, that may not be accurate but you ain't never heard anything like this from her before.  And after bumping it several times, I couldn't think of any artist who could even pull &quot;Danger&quot; off.<br />'WorldWide' underground is a very tasty appetizer until the next proper Erykah album.  Heck, I'd say at the least it's enough to hold us over for a week until the new OutKast album drops.

B00005K3OT|4.0|Juliette Binoche plays a chocolatier who waltzes into a small French provincial town, set in the late 1950s, expecting to sweeten their lives with her confection, but ends up also threatening the grip of the town's mayor and cleric on its citizens (a very French political allegory). If nothing else, you will be drawn into the slow, sensuous magic of the chocolaterie which begins to transform the various town characters - a beautiful unmarried woman and her daughter, a cranky landlady,  a kindly old man enamored of one of the older townswomen, and  an old couple for whom the confectionery has an aphrodisiac effect. Johnny Depp, who plays a roguish river rat, Judi Dench, and Lena Olin, together with Binoche, form a grand cast who deliver a mild, sensuous comedy. Binoche and Depp form a great pair.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I had the privilege of watching these guys in Lollapalooza and <BR>although nobody knew the new songs (only &quot;W&amp;P&quot;, of course)<BR>new songs in the set were nothing less than great, now on CD I'm amazed. IMO, I think this CD delivers what people expect from APC, deep and honest good music, not the hollow and forgettable music that almost everyone is making (with very few exceptions). <BR>Listen, pay attention with all your senses and you'll figure it out.
B00005JLD4|4.0|This is a grim documentary about the \\"stolen generation\\" of Australians - the young, part-white Aborigines who were snatched from their homes and raised in government-run training schools which would prepare them for a life as domestic servants or factory workers, all of this  under the watchful eye of A.O. Neville, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The film depicts three young girls, who after being removed from their mother to a training school 1,500 miles away, escape and make the long journey back, helped by a long fence used to protect farmland from the ravages of Australia's rabbit population.  The film is solidly based on fact, drawing from a book written by the lone surviving daughter of one of the three girls. Despite contemporary sensibilities to this grim policy once viewed as one of enlightened benevolence, the movie itself is not heavy-handed in moralistic overtones, but rather focuses on the ingenuity of the three girls in eluding their Aboriginal tracker (skillfully played by David Gulpilil). In an extraordinarily powerful climax, we actually see cameo appearances by two of three survivors of this epic journey at the end of the movie, seventy years after their feat in the Western Australian outback. This movie provides valuable insight into a poorly understood part of Australian history.
B000059XUO|4.0|this movie is awesome there will never be a better love story than this movie because thats what i think this movie a love story.This movie is great its dark and romantic at the same time
0375414932|4.0|Any Human Heart, a novel that is written as an autobiography that spans nearly 80 years in the life of Logan Mountstuart, is a hilarious and sophisticated piece of work. It gives us account's of his life from his years in an English prep school, his take on the British social system, his years at Oxford, his marriages, the curse of two wars and their effects on his life, certainly exacerbated by his imprisonment for 2 years during WWII. When he is released to return home - he finds everything changed: his family, his marriage, his country, and his world. Any Human Heart is a tale of lonliness, disappointment, and despair - yet it makes you laugh through your tears. <BR>Well worth the read, even tho it's 500 pages long.
1570428654|5.0|Listening to David Sedaris's voice narrating 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is a danger if you are behind the wheel! In his voice you can hear the tough (yet funny) times at school &amp; the Speech Pathologist, with his dad and the Music Teacher. Sometimes it's almost too much to listen to!<br />Sedaris's voice is very similar to his sister Amy Sedaris who was Jerry Blank in the cult show 'Strangers with Candy.' They share the same brand of humor: dry, cynical, witty.<br />This is one you certainly don't want to miss and I would suggest the audio version for more personalization (and laughs).
B00005JKN9|5.0|This was a trully excellent movie.  Although the characters are ficticious, the facts are real.  The movie depicts life in the New York Irish Slums and shows the plight of immigrants arriving into the United States at the time of the &quot;War for Southern Independence&quot;.  Having read many letters and autobiographies of this period, I find the movie to be historically true, and gives a different perspective to life in America in the 1860's.  By-the-way, it is also highly entertaining with excellent performances by all of the cast.
B00005JLMH|3.0|This movie was well-directed, with good actors and an excellent soundtrack (Vangelis is brilliant with soundtracks). The story does well morally, as we see a paradise and peacful people being wrecked by greedy and violent Europeans.<br />Having said that, the film falls flat as historical fiction.<br />First, Columbus' role in the enslavement and exploitation as been played down. Others have spoke of this, so I'll take it no further.<br />Second, the Caribbean was no paradise in 1492. Each tribe had a warrior caste (guess what they were used for) and practiced slavery. And I was never aware of any slaves (other than Ottoman Jannisaries) enjoying their status. <br />Third, Spain, and by extension European civilisation, is portrayed in a totally negative light. While the scenes regarding the Inquisition are correct, the film refers to Muslim Spain (conquered that same year) as being a 'great culture'. Anyone who views Islamic history (anywhere) objectively would realise that Christian sectors, for all their faults, are vastly preferable if one aint Muslim. <br />These may seem minor points but the impression one gets from both this film and and other media these days is that white Europeans are evil, and anybody else is good. It's not nearly that simple. And the movie makes it out to be like that.<br />Just for anyone who's interested, here's an article arguing the European's case. [...]
B0000BYM3K|2.0|I don't understand why people should be compelled to like this album just because it's Iron Maiden.  To say someone isn't a true fan because they're giving an opinion is ludicrous. I found this album had it's moments but they were very few &amp; far between &amp; overall the album was embarrasing, with poor lyrics &amp; terrible song structures.  The first five maiden albums were classics, the energy &amp; tightness of the band was top notch &amp; that's why they were so successful.  I remember reading an interview with Bruce Dickinson when he left the band &amp; he said that he felt the band starting losing it after Piece Of Mind.  He said that he heard Operation Mindcrime around the time they recorded Seventh Son &amp; realised that it was way better than what they were doing &amp; said there was no way that they could compete with it.  Somewhere in Time &amp; Seventh Son are ok, but after this it was all down hill &amp; the 90's were a complete disaster for the band, I remember buying No Prayer for the Dying &amp; not believing my ears, I couldn't believe it was the same band.  Bruce actually released a couple of good solo albums in the late nineties with Accident of Birth &amp; Chemical Wedding so I was looking forward to him coming back into the Maiden fold.  Unfortunately Brave New World &amp; Dance of Death do not live up to expectations.  There are many moments on this latest album that make me cringe, with lyrics better suited to Spinal Tap than Iron Maiden.  I could almost imagine a miniature stonehenge descending onto a stage somewhere when the bouncy medieval guitar kicks in - this is truly dwarf dancing stuff!  The guitar solo's, on the whole, are unimaginative &amp; lack melody, I think Janick Gers contributes to this awful messy style of playing mostly &amp; I really miss the Smith\Murray lead breaks of old - if you check out Powerslave or Somewhere in Time you'll know what I mean - there's no melody or thought behind these solo's &amp; they lack theurgency &amp; precision that was once there.  It's not all bad though, it is an improvement on the stuff with Blayze Bailey which was truly horrendous - there are some promising moments but they've got a long way to go to return to their former standard.  Perhaps they don't need to as they already have a loyal fanbase &amp; have a superb back catalogue.  Maiden are still a classic band though &amp; I'm pleased that they are still together but I really hope they can surprise me next time with a truly fresh sounding power metal album &amp; I'll be on here singing their praises once again.  Oh well there's still hope. Up the Irons!!
7119005901|5.0|Like many people I first heard of this novel through the games from Koei. I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school. A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation. I had always wanted to read the novel, and I'm glad I did. The story starts around 185 AD, just at the end of the Han dynasty. It continues until the end of the Han dynasty in 220, and finally to the reunification of china around 280. The principle characters are rulers, generals, and politicians that make up the Wu, Wei, and Shu kingdoms. <br />The book is really fast read, considering that the book is 2400+ pages long, it really didn't take that long to read. It is interesting and something is always going on. I don't think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general. They have a pretty short life. It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed, but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen. The novel does focus on the time period from 185-220, after that things start going pretty quick and after 235 AD the story is essentially over, except for a few details. <br />I can't recommend it enough, you could read it 50 times and still get something out of it. If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be one of the books I'd like to have. Now all I need to do is visit china and see some of this stuff from the book
B00004TWZF|5.0|I have seen both American and European versions. The only long version I could find for region 2 is the German printed version. It has german and spanish audio in 5.1 format, but English audio is in 2.0. In the English format, the dialogues in the beginning B/W scenes are in English. It was Italian in the original version.
B00005JMNY|5.0|Party Monster was the not the first ive heard of Michael Alig. I was getting into the party scene the year that Michael Alig killed Angel Melendez.  I wasnt a club kid in New York but was familiar with what happened.<BR>Granted Kieren and Rory Culkin are great Actors but when i was growing up this was the guy in all the movies and those who remember the first glimses of him on the big screen his brothers just dont compare..  <BR>Its great to see him on the big screen again and this time its on his own choice, the movie he wanted to do and acting because he wants to.  <BR>Unfortionatly it doesnt look like this is gonna be in all theatres because it doesnt seem to be coming to my home here in Mississippi or even New Orleans..  I did order the book though...  cant wait to see this on dvd atleast.  it looks like its gonna be great..
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I love it, but I have to admit, much like many of the other reviewers, it took me a second chance.  It's very different from anything I've heard before, but it still captures me.  Weak and Powerless is the first single, and is the most mainstream sound on the disc.  The Noose is probably the best, and I love Vanish. <br />If you have the first CD, or are a Maynard fan, know this - nothing on this disc is in the vein of Judith or Tool as far as harshness, it is all a focus on the beauty of music, much like &quot;3 Libras.&quot;<br />Overall, a solid piece of work, peaceful, deep, serene, and powerful.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle. Thirteenth Step. September 16, 2003. More than three years after the release of Mer de Noms, A Perfect Circle comes back into the music scene, with two new members and an obvious change in sound. For previous APC fans, Thirteenth Step is an amazing album; for new APC fans, it will probably be a turn off. It sounds more like a Tool album than anything. If you were expecting a Smashing Pumpkins-like sound because of the addition of James Iha, or a Manson-like sound because of the addition of Jeordie White, you are terribly mistaken. Bodering on industrial, the new APC sound is unique. Thirteenth Step is fifty minutes of pure genius. Howerdel, Keenan, Freese, White, and Iha all collaborate to produce twelve great works of art. This album is a must-have for avid A Perfect Circle fans.
B00005JM0B|5.0|OK, I was very skeptical of seeing this flick as I thought it was basically going to be T2, 2.  Oh yay, another more advanced Terminator is coming back to kill John and Arny has to save him...again.  The commercials didn't really do anything to contradict my original pessamism.<br />Boy was I wrong, In my mind, this movie blows T2 out of the water.  Granted it is not the groundbreaker of special effects that T2 was, but as far as being able to laugh at a movie that is still very much a suspensful action flick, this is a masterpiece.  It does an excellent job of making you care about each of the characters, having the main villain be a hot chick doesn't hurt either, and the ending (I will not give it away) was a complete suprise.  <br />With the way it ended though, I wouldn't be suprised if they call the next sequal \\"The Rise of John Connor\\".  It would of course have to be NC-17 though.
B00005JLD4|4.0|In the 1930s the Australian government, after years of brutality against the Aborigines, decided to try another tactic -- the inculcation of the indigenous people into the superior English tradition -- thus proving that the only thing worse than hostility is kindly ignorance.  Believing that all traces of their 'inferiority' could be washed away after three generations of breeding with the conquering bloodline, officials began rounding up half-castes, separating them from their families, and raising them in indoctrination camps.  This is the story of three little girls who ran away, following the longest fence in the world back toward their home and their mothers.  The three young girls do a fine job in these demanding roles, though sometimes it's difficult to hear the spoken lines.  The supporting cast is uniformly good, the settings are quite dramatic, and the film, while not touching on some of the more disturbing aspects of this government plan (who were these kids supposed to mate with, for example), does leave you grateful that some things have changed in the past century, even if it's not enough.<br /><br />The film can be heard only in English, with English captioning as the only subtitle option.<br />DVD extras include a 45-minute documentary concerned primarily with the casting of the three main characters, young aboriginal girls, and their experience during the filming, including an emotional reaction to the abduction scene; a commentary track with director Noyce, composer Peter Gabriel, actor Kenneth Branagh, screenwriter Olsen and author Pilkington (who is the daughter of one of the film's protagonists); and trailers for Frida, Quiet American and (Kieslowski's) Heaven.

B00004R99J|4.0|Pocahontas is a Disnified film about the American Indian maiden who befriended John Smith, an English explorer in the New World.  As usual, the heroine has animal friends and sings pretty songs against beautiful animated backdrops.  Our family thought this was an entertaining film but it did not immediately capture us as other animated family features have done.<br />Spoken languages available are English, French and Spanish; closed captioning is the only subtitle option.  DVD extra features are: trailers; a read-along story; a trivia game; and two music videos from the film.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|Having seen E. Badu in concert where she tested out some of her forthcoming tracks from this album, my expectations were a little high for this release. Imagine my disappointment when I put this anemic album into my CD changer. First off, there are only ten tracks, two of which are taken up by a weak intro and &quot;outro.&quot; &quot;Love of My Life&quot; was a pointless remix of the far superior original. Even Queen Latifah and Angie Stone couldn't pull it out of mediocrity. Additionally, Badu keeps weaving lyrics from her old albums into her new ones, a technique that gives her releases a sense of continuity, but one that's beginning to make me wonder if she's had any new ideas in a while. I had recently read an article where Badu bragged about having enough songs to fill up two albums. Where's the beef, girl? The two standout tracks are &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;Woo&quot; which capture the urgency and playfulness of her live performances. For such an amazing and talented artist, she just didn't deliver this time. I see Erykah like one of those bright but lazy students who just throw a lot of stuff together to meet a deadline. I'm still a fan, but I'd think twice before recommending this to anyone.
B0000AR8NK|3.0|Just letting you know beforehand , that for the US and UK Amazon reviewer's who are touting Bowie's great writing on 'Try Some Buy Some' and how it harkens back to his Aladdin Sane days, and is a beautiful ballad ---<br />The song is by George Harrison.<br />Read the liner notes.<br />Then buy 'Living in the Material World' to hear the original version and wonder why the song was great to begin with.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How do they manage to throw away so many promising shows? \\"Firefly\\" was probably the best of the group but then I started thinking of all the bonehead decisions. Cancel \\"Family Guy\\", cancel \\"Action\\", cancel \\"Fastlane\\". What do they keep? \\"Cops\\", \\"Performing As...\\", \\"Temptation Island 3\\", \\"Paradise Hotel\\", ... What a record of stupidity. They won't listen to petitions or mountains of e-mail. The only way to educate the dim-witted executives at FOX who continually destroy every promising project by creative executives at FOX is to buy, buy, buy the DVD's that are allowed to escape such as \\"FireFly\\" and \\"Family Guy\\".
B0000BYM3K|5.0|all i can say is wow. they really used the 3 guitars well on this album more than on brave new world. maiden is starting to mature in their song writing ability you can really see this on paschendale and monstegur. if you havent liked maiden since the 80s i recommend trying this album, it ranks up there with the best of them.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is a great followup to Mer de Noms. The songs on this album may actually end up being my favorite APC songs with the exception of Brena and Orestes :) Don't miss out listening to The Noose, Blue, Pet, or Gravity in addition to the rest of the album. If you ever liked A Perfect Circle, even if it was just Judith on the radio, try this cd. APC fans will not be let down, and those not familiar with them may just find themselves hooked.
1586212567|1.0|I just took this book out of the library today and plan on returning it as soon as possible.  Robert Kiyosaki is rehashing what has been said for many years. It is too conceptual for my taste.  I gave one star due to the fact that Kiyosaki was able to make a fortune of money by getting people to buy his books.<BR>Don't waste your time reading this book.
0375713751|1.0|However, let's start on a positive note.  I loved the very British sensability of this novel.  I loved Kate Reddy's extremely wry sense of humor (I chuckled, not laughed, but chuckled aloud throughout the book.)  Having said that, though, there was nothing else I could relate to in this book.  I am not a working mother with two young children who can't find enough hours in the day as Kate Reddy is. I do not hold down a very high powered job in the world of high finance and investments.  This again is Kate Reddy's world.  The author did nothing to make me feel like I was a part of the story.  I was trapped in Kate's day-timer, forced to read journal entries and her notes to self. The whole effect was very choppy and I constantly found myself wishing that the writing were more descriptive so I would have something to sink my teeth into.<br />A good author will draw the reader in by developing the characters well, or describing the situations to the point where the reader feels like he/she is an active participant, not just a passive reader of words written on a page.  I didn't particularly care for any of the characters in this novel, I just read about them with about as much interest as I would read a cereal box because that is all the author gave me to go on.  I do not understand what all the hubub that surrounds this book is about.
B00005JLH3|5.0|I do totally agree that its about time somebody made a movie about marching band.  All these cheesy teen movies about high school football stars drive me insane.  There was some good stuff in it.... while I didn't feel it was all completely realistic, that didn't necessarily take anything away from the movie.  although I must say, if you found this movie to be the least bit interesting or entertaining, you should definitely check out Drum Corps International (DCI).  If your not into paying 98 bucks for the finals dvd, PBS is broadcasting a show about finals in most states right now, and it should be in the rest by thanksgiving.  That is some incredible stuff that anyone can enjoy if you take the time to find it.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|With each album, Erykah shows her true Piscean nature of being eclectic and not being afraid to just stay out there on that indefinable limb trying new things and staying true to HER vision.  It's head bopping, serious, fun....and lightly political without trying to be [or is she?]...the production is hot, even has a little 70's groove to a few trax for us `old heads'.  I highly recommend all those go out and cop it, like, yesterday...just too bad it's only an EP.
0140187537|3.0|Winter is another of those books more easily appreciated at the age of 20 than at 50.  I loved it as a young person, care nothing for it as an older one.  I was disappointed to discover that fact.  As a Steinbeck lover I'm tempted to believe Winter of our Discontent was a book written at a time when the writer was in a state of abject depression.  The book lacks the usual penetrating characterization, the solid plotting and the rapier wit found in his best works.<br /><br />Here, Steinbeck's character, an old 'founders' family descendant, finds himself in a moral turmoil.  He struggles and comes up lacking in his own eyes.  The struggle then evolves with a different type of challenge:  to continue to live, or to choose death as an alternative to imperfection, of being a flawed human being.

0142004235|4.0|Cain and Abel, Steinbeck captures the tragedy of the human experience in all his characters in East of Eden.  I'm a life-long admirer of Steinbeck.  That's caused me to go back and re-read each of his books several times over the years.  I find my tastes have evolved.  Some of my favorites in 1960 have become least favorites.  Not so, East of Eden.  I loved this book as a young man and love it still as a curmudgeon.
068484267X|5.0|Absolutely spellbounding tale of a young person's early life in poverty.  He writes in beautifully colored language, painting the portrait of a child who watches siblings die and other horrid circumstances.  Irish will relate but it works for all origins.

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|CD of the year. Best ever yet. Lyrics great.  It gets three stars becasue Tool has been beening getting better and better this rates my lowest for Tool and Perfect Circle.  It took a step back for me but still pretty good.
0142000663|4.0|I've never understood why Grapes of Wrath is so highly acclaimed among the Steinbeck works.  I was forced to read it the first time in a high school English course.  I believed, then, that I hated the writing of John Steinbeck.  Later, after I'd come to know his other works I went back for a re-read, thinking I'd been jaundiced by an HS English teacher presentation.  I still didn't care for it. Of the Steinbeck works it's the only one I've never read repeatedly as I aged.
B000088E6D|5.0|That's all that can be said. If you're a fan of Harry, Tony, Frank, Sammy, or Dean--buy this now!
0385504209|5.0|This book starts out with a bang.  I didn't think the level of suspense could be sustained for 450 plus pages, but it was.  There is a suspenseful hook on almost every other page.  Well-drawn characters, believable dialog, and a crisp writing style combine to make this fast paced story hard to put down.  I can't speak for the accuracy of the `facts' presented in this book, but as a mystery/thriller it works extraordinarily well.  I was a little skeptical of all the hype surrounding this book and the many glowing reviews, but I was not one bit disappointed.  An exceptionally good read.
B00000I41J|5.0|This CD is one for everybody with even a passing interest in jazz, from the working musician to the casual listener who likes to relax with a glass of wine and some gorgeous music.<br />First, for the non-musician who simply enjoys beautiful music: This CD should be in your regular rotation. The trumpet and saxophone playing, both other-worldly in their own right, seamlessly blend into a beautifully transcendant chiaroscuro of icy cool and fiery depth. The piano playing is also brilliant, ranging from swinging and funky to classically dignified.<br />Now for the hard-core jazz fan:<br />If you don't own this, get it now! If you own this and haven't listened to it for a while, listen now! This is not Miles at his most adventurous or most innovative. Here his skills as an arranger who is able to bring street sensibilities to high-level jazz without pandering or losing one iota of integrity are on full display. But fear not, because brilliant soloing abounds in the persona of Cannonball Adderley. Technical fireworks tempered with deep blues and a Bird-informed be-bop sensibility are all on display by the masterful Cannonball here. Hank Jones is the secret power of this session, displaying multi-faceted chops that must have had Miles grinning with anticipation as he put together these arrangements. Art Blakey brings his usual personality here, but also adds more melodicism than customary, even approaching the incredible work of Max Roach on \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" during the title track.<br />There is one bit that seems to be missing. One of the things that made Miles' quintet with Coltrane so amazing was hearing the eloquence of the muted trumpet, followed by the titanic power of Coltrane's tenor sax. If I have any criticism of this album, it is that all of the soloists are so proficient in this idiom that they seem content to fly above the music, rather than getting down and rasslin' with it the way Coltrane might have. To my mind, an album with Miles and Coltrane powered by Blakey might have exceeded even the considerable heights attained by \\"Somethin' Else\\". But in any case, what we have is more than we should ever hope to ask for.d by Blakey might have exceeded even the considerable heights attained by \\"Somethin' Else\\". But in any case, what we have is more than we should ever hope to ask for.
B000089RVX|1.0|Just a look at the cover of this album and I knew it was going to be bad.  Just one listen and I knew that the uneducated masses of music listeners would hail it as &quot;revolutionary&quot; or a &quot;step forward&quot; because it had female vocals.  Just one minute into it I knew it was worse than I had expected.<br />This is a media-driven one-trick-pony which neither excites or impresses.<br />This is not innovative. This is not the next big thing.<br />This is garbage.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|Christmas vacation ranks right up there with the all-time best Christmas movies.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'angelo reprise their rolls as the Griswolds in this third \\"vacation movie.  Also back is Randy Quaid as hick cousin Eddie.<br />Clark Griswold just wants to give his family a great old fashioned Christmas but typically goes over the top on everything.  This movie demonstrates all the bad things about Christmas...dealing with family, shopping, decorating, etc...<br />It all makes for one funny, but even a bit touching knowing how much Clark loves his family and does give them that great Christmas in the end.<br />EVerything works here.  Great character actors including E.G. marshall, and Diane ladd in roles as two of the Griswolds parents.<br />The Special edition is nothing to write home about.  All you get is an original trailer and a commentary track with Quiad, DeAngelo, and a few others, but no Chase.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie too ! A few fast cars and some of the other mindless trappings that usually accompany this type of action film can make for a cool diversion. Unfortunately, the story line is absurd and the dialogue is unintentionally laughable. As for the action scenes, the 1/4 mile drag races last more than a minute which about the time it would take a fast runner to complete the distance. This movie disappoints across the board...
B0000AR8NK|3.0|REALITY makes you realize how good Heathen really was. For my money, he got back on track with Outside but since since Scary Monsters his albums have suffered from the same malady. Namely, they're too layered. Too busy. One of the things that made Heathen successful was it's restraint production wise. The hooks weren't so buried in distractions. Suffice it to say, I consider myself a big fan. But Reality is fairly hit or miss. But Bowie's the kind of talent that slow burns, even to most seasoned listener. So the tracks that don't grab you at first, will eventually seep into your consciousness.<br /><br />The real stunner that reeled me in is, \\"The Loneliest Guy\\". It's Bowie at his most vulnerable. A simple but eerie little tune, featuring some stellar piano from Mike Garson of \\"Aladdin Sane\\" fame. One reviewer described, \\"Bring Me The Disco King\\"  as \\"Astro Lounge\\" & that seems pretty apt. Its one of the best things Bowie has cut in ages. Once again, stark arrangements & Mike Garson come to the rescue.<br /><br />As for the rest,\\"Fall Dog Bombs The Moon\\" is pretty catchy as is the opener, \\"New Killer Star\\". \\"Days\\" brings the best of 1999's Hours to mind. The reality one has to face is that Reality particularly memorable outside of the aforementioned. His cover of \\"Pablo Picasso\\" is gratuitous and overwrought. Why mess with a good thing? Along this vein, Bowie's stab at \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" serves only to remind what a truly gifted songwriter & great loss George Harrison was. And I suspect that was the point behind the nod in his direction.<br /><br />So along with the forgettable there's also a few late career gems. Reality may not be his most inspired or focused but it certainly isn't his worst.e time of day. It certainly keeps up the ante but doesn't quite surpass last year's HEATHEN.
B00006JDSI|5.0|Almost needless to say, F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu is one of the most highly regarded German expressionist silent films, and it is also considered to be one of the greatest adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula. It is also in the public domain, and even the best prints of Nosferatu leave much to be desired. Therefore, there are countless versions of the film on DVD and VHS where the quality ranges from fair to poor and running time varies. I've seen many of these versions and I truly can say that Kino On Video's restored authorized DVD is FAR SUPERIOR to that of any other version I have ever seen. The picture quality is as good as we may ever expect this film to be, the color tinting is appropriate and not over saturated, the croping is fine, projection speed not too fast and not too slow, the intertitles with new translation are excellent considering they were made just for this DVD, and finally the music scores provided are just as effective as any other score for this film I have heard. Nosferatu not only being an excellent film gets its best treatment on this Kino DVD. If you must buy any version of this film, this one is highly recomended and really the only one to buy. Also check out the excellent remake by Werner Herzog and staring Klas Kinski.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This disc it's the best record to date from Madonna. I'm not a huge fan of her and her work, but I truly believe that this collection of songs has been very missunderstood at this time.<BR>Every word it's a testimony of Madonna's life at this portion of time, and the music in this record sound like anything that she's put out lately.<br />American Life : This is the song that everybody recognize as \\"the worst song of all time\\". I was hooked with it since I listening to it for the first time and I thought it was a very intelligent song, the rap it's very nice on this one and the production it's very simple, for wich the songs sounds refreshing.<br />Hollywood: at first I don't liked this one that much, but with a couple of listenings I realize that the message was a reall ironical one and the beat was just killer. I like the part when she says \\"... the sun is shinning like you knew it would\\".<br />I'm So Stupid: one of the coolest songs on the CD, the beat it's really catchy and the words too, in the beginning of the first chorus the sound effect it's just great, it makes you think that it's something wrong with the CD player.<br />Love Profusion: the guitar and the melody sound very well, 'cause the fusion of melodys are exquisits. The part when she says \\"I got you under my skin\\" sounds really sexy.<br />Nobody Knows Me: it's like the \\"Impressive Instant\\" of the CD, 'cause Madonna's voice it's transformed by the vocoder at the extreme, the beat it's really agressive and the lyrics too. Sound kind of angry if you listen to it carefully.<br />Nothing Fails: One of the bests songs on the disc, it's like a mix of \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Gone\\", the guitar playing sounds delicious, and Madonna's voice left you a very sweet flavor.<br />Intervention: I don't really know to whom it's dedicated this piece, but it is mellow and tender, the acoustic sound it's just terrific on this one.<br />X-Static Process: the melody and the lyrics are well done, but the guitar on this one sounds kind of boring and without any substance; a good tune anyway.<br />Mother And Father: the rap on this is kind of weird but in a good way; Madonna's voice sounds like she was a little girl. The beginning it's just sad (\\" There was a time I had a mother, it was nice\\").<br />Die Another Day: everybody knows it... excellent.<br />Easy Ride: it's he final song that \\"Gone\\" was supposed to be. The beat and the lyrics are the strong points on this one, it's the best song this CD, no doubt about it.
B000000WG4|2.0|I was really into this album when it came out. I was in High School and I used to listen to it alone in my room with the black lights on and a candle or two burning. Way cool....<br />Time passes and I stumble upon a copy of it in a used CD rack. 'Hey I remember this!&quot; $5.00 and I'm on my way to relive some of my lost youth. <br />I rip open the package and jam the thing in my car's CD player. I can't wait. Ahhh there's the familar theme from that scary movie. Cool. Stuff slowly beings to happen...more instruments start to come in...Yeah, just like I rememeber... 5 minutes in and I'm starting to wonder, &quot;hey where's the good stuff?&quot; Ten minuets pass and I can hardly keep from giggling. The melodies are simplistic and nieve, the sound textures are silly and the music is - dare I say it? - boring! Yes there are some nice tunes that start off filled with promise, but then they either get repeated over and over again into oblivion or they get swamped with cliche ridden sounds (When's the last time anyone used a fuzz effect on a guitar? There's a reason why, ya know. It sounds stupid!) <br />I really lost it when the caveman chorus started up. Talk about stupid! I used to think it was a nice and silly way to break up the piece - sort of an aural intermission - but now I can't help but think that Mike O. was serious about this section  - well as serious as he was in the preceeding sections of the work anyway - and that he actually thought that this part was, well, meaningful or arty or ...something other than just plain old stupid.<br />At last, the formerly comical but not really pretentious and inane part with the english guy introducing the instuments. YAWN! Who the heck cares? <br />And finally, the thing that sums it all up perfectly: the sailor's hornpipe at the the end speedong away into silliness. Couldn't think of a good ending, could ya, Mike? <br />I did try to listen to the CD one more time a few days later to see if I had missed something. Nope. I ended up giving it to my (older) brother - also a former fan of the piece -  and I don't think he's gotten all the way through it. <br />Bottom line: Pretension posing as art, silliness posing as creative cleverness. <br />I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might be worth listen to if you're stoned. Or if you have nothing else to do.
B00008NG5V|3.0|I bought this CD and Brushfire Fairytales after hearing good things about them from some friends.  Fired up On and On in my Plextor DVD/CDRW and the CD spun up real fast and loud and then made a noise like it was lifting off of the tray and bouncing around inside the drive.  I tried ripping the tracks off the CD to encode to MP3 (I have an AIWA car MP3 CD player) and they came out a little muddy, but I was eventually able to get some decent sounding MP3 out of the CD.  I had the exact same problems with Brushfire Fairytales as well.  I have never had any problems with any other CD in that drive, FWIW.  As far as I can tell, the CD's have some sort of copy protection scheme.  I was not able to copy the CD on my first try (but my drive scratched up the inner plastic of the disc pretty good), but then again I don't really have a need to.<br />As far as the music goes, it's not bad, but I really don't think it's that great either.  Personally, I find Mason Jennings' stuff more creative and enjoyable to listen to.  That being said, On and On is definitely a good album to chill with, and maybe suck down a brew or two while the sun sets.
B000002MJC|5.0|With this release DM finally became the truly sleazy sweaty rock band they always secretly desired to be (or at least frontman Dave Gahan did). For the followers of DM through their career this album certinaly came as a shock - it certainly did to me. But when you work through the initial resistance this album shows itself to be a truly memorable achievement. Whilst Violator saw DM master their skills and cement their position as the masters of electronic rock, this recording showed them pushing the envelope. From I Feel You's screeching guitars and pulsating energy (check out the Afghan Swamp Surgery mix on Maxi CD for a super treatment of this song!) to the stripped back Condemnation Depeche Mode moved into areas no one would have thought. Apparently recorded under extremely tense conditions with addictions and works stresses - the tensions seem to emanate from the album. The production on a DM album has never been so good and Alan Wilder's departure is sorely missed. This album clearly showed the manic obsession the guy applied to all DM productions. Every track is different and every track shows a different side to the band from the classic synth warmth of songs such as Walking in My Shoes and Higher Love to the electro frenzy of Rush and then to the soulful Get Right With Me and the super sexy In Your Room. This album shimmers, rocks, grinds and crunches. As a long time fan and owner of all their CDs - this is the CD I always come back to me when I want to release some tension. A True Classic.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Wow. This album is well structured, with a solid theme that is prevailent throughout. I must say I don't know why people are so obsessed with comparing this album to other albums of any kind. A band comes out with a new album. Isn't the point of a &quot;new&quot; album to make a &quot;new&quot; sound that we can enjoy?  I was extremely impressed with the creative talent that was displayed here. It definetly took a few listens to get used to, but you really have to give it that chance. I would also like to mention something about power. This album is rather mellow, however, power, is not something that is loud. Power, is something that makes you feel strong emotions. Listen to this album, really listen... to the sound, not the similarity of guitar riffs to another band. Pretend all the band members create one sound. In actuality, you shouldn't even need to. If you can accomplish that much, you will be greatly rewarded. A work of Art.
B00005B58Y|5.0|I have virtually every album Miles has ever made.  I began collecting his albums when I was in fifth grade.  I own pretty much everything from the 1949 Live Performances in Paris with Tadd Dameron to Star People.  This particular recording is among my favorites of all of those Miles albums.  It swings like no other, and is also, along with Porgy & Bess, the direct link between Miles Ahead and Kind Of Blue.  Any fan of trumpet or jazz music needs to own this.  Miles Davis, John Coltrane on tenor, Cannonball Adderley on alto, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums.  With a group like this you'd think these guys would get in the way of each other because they're all so incredible.  However, this is far from the case.  They interact perfectly.  From the brilliant fast pace of Jackie McLean's \\"Dr. Jekyll\\" to the stolen \\"Walkin'\\" remake \\"Sid's Ahead\\", Miles is in miraculous form on some bebop and blues.  Cannonball and Trane really get into it as well.  Listen to Trane tear through Dizzy Gillespie and John Lewis's \\"Two Bass Hit\\".  \\"Miles\\" better known now as \\"Milestones\\" (either one is acceptable), has become a cool jazz classic and Miles sounds amazing on it.  So does everyone else.  \\"Billy Boy\\" gives Red Garland a chance to shine and finally solo (I don't recall him soloing on any of the previous tunes).  Here Miles does not play, and reportedly asked Red to imitate Ahmad Jamal, one of his favorite pianists.  What a fun tune, it swings like crazy.  However, the best is saved for last on \\"Straight, No Chaser\\", with everyone going absolutely insane.  Cannonball has a witty quotation of Bird's \\"Now's The Time\\" solo, check that out.  Every solo is fun and swinging.  If you're a fan of great music, you'll love this album.  One of Miles's many great records.
B00004T9VY|5.0|This was my first Cat Steven's album and I find it's his best. Songs like &quot;Wild World&quot;, &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot;, and &quot;Where Do The Children Play&quot; are my favorites on this excellent album. Cat Stevens went on to release some great albums before he decided to become Muslim and give up singing &amp; songwriting. If there's is one cd you purchase (other than his Greatest Hits) this should be it.
B0000025ZK|4.0|This is David Gilmour's first solo album after Roger Waters left Pink Floyd.  I like this because it has a softer edge than Roger Waters solo works.  I love &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;.  It is a fantastic song.  This one took some getting used to though.
B0000584V3|5.0|I wish I could give this album a million stars.  This is just beauty and darkness blended to a perfection.  I could listen to this album over and over and over.  From &quot;The Leper Affinity&quot; to the title track, this album has so many highs and lows it's like being born and dying, going to hell and being reborn again when the album finishes.  A musical masterpiece.
B00000811N|3.0|This is Roger Waters first solo effort.  It is a soundtrack from a movie and the songs are very wierd sounding.  Some of them are pretty sick sounding (namely the song that would be the first song on side two of the album).  The last song is pretty good though.
1559408855|5.0|\\"Salo\\" is a diffcult, challenging piece of cinematic excellence. Brutal and violent in its unforgiving, nihilistic portrayal of the human demons of sexuality, power, sorrow and torture, this film will undoubtedly shut the eyelids and minds of people who are unwilling to face up to the sometimes painful crimes of life. Pasolini, an accomplished cinematographer, editor and writer/poet(his Petrolio is amongst one of the greatest literary achievements ever, IMHO:))is unrelenting in his torment of the captured viewer(this is the point). We are forced to see torture and sodomy; scatophagy and scalping; and listen to endless perverse yet thoughtful dialogues and soliloquies about disgusting sex acts involving feces. We are forced to question constantly the tightly-knotted links between fascist mastery and capitalist submission; the see-sawing power war of gender supremacy; the many conflicts and spiritual contradictions of homosexuality; the sad effects of a crowd mentality. HOWEVER SICK THAT MAY BE, this is a perfect film. The cinematography is brilliant and astounding, the colors of this film are enough reason for any film enthusiast to endure this moral exercise of a movie. The acting, dialogue and script are perfect(if not horrifically scatological)- though the other amazon reviewers are right to say \\"it's not for the squeamish.\\" Pasolini is a mad genius, though of the true breed: he will not be remembered as Van Gogh's madness is, with mouse pads and corporate cushions; he will tell the truth in words and film and be martyred.
B0000025DD|5.0|This is David Gilmour's first solo album.  It was released in the time between Animals and The Wall.  It is a pretty good effort.  The guitar is awesome and David Gilmour has an incredible voice.  It also sounds alot different than the stuff he did with Pink Floyd.<BR>It shows that he has some musical talent as well.
B000089A07|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I have watched it many times since it appeared on DVD and I usually notice something each time that I didn't see before.  <br />Anthony Hopkins shines again.  He is the best Hannibal there ever was or will be.  I saw this movie because of my adoration of him, but I came away with the realization that this movie has no problem standing on its own.  I gave this movie 5 stars because of the acting and the storyline.<br />I'm not going to go on and on about the story behind Hannibal Lecter because most people have either seen or heard about Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  Red Dragon takes you back to the very beginning and you get to see how it all started.  The dinner scene at the beginning is classic.  Lecter is having dinner with some orchestra members and one of them is missing...then someone asks what they are eating that tastes so good.  Lecter gets that look in his eyes and the whole audience knows what's going on.  <br />In Red Dragon, Lecter is asked to help Will Graham (Edward Norton) to track down another serial killer.  The ending is great and there is a surprise near the end.  Just when you think everything has come to a close and the problem is solved, watch out.  Nothing is as it seems.
B0000025ZF|4.0|This album is Roger Waters first solo effort after leaving the band.  It is a worthy effort but it misses the sound of David Gilmour's guitar.  The songwriting is excellent (as usual).  The person he did get to play guitar is pretty good (Eric Clapton).  The storyline isn't bad, but it is still missing something.
B00005ATQH|4.0|This is a long film (152 minutes) and actually two-films-in-one. The first focuses on Humbert Humbert (James Mason) and his involvement with his landlady, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), as well as on his strong physical attraction to her teenage daughter Lolita (Sue Lyon). The second and (in my opinion) much less effective segment continues the plot but without Charlotte. Winters brings so much energy to her role as a sexually frustrated widow whose cultural pretensions are both hilarious and pathetic but never endearing. When she is no longer on screen, the plot sags. Mason's performance is consistently first-rate but Lyon's body makes promises her acting skills cannot keep. When she and Mason are required to sustain the narrative, the results are often disappointing. As for the character Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), I really don't know what quite to make of him. Presumably he represents corruption in various forms and is viewed by Humbert is an unworthy, indeed despicable rival for Lolita's attention. For whatever reasons, Sellers seems to be going through the motions. The supporting players are OK. None stands out.<br /><br />Lolita was directed by Stanley Kubrick and is essentially based on Vladimir Nabakov's controversial novel in which the nymphet is 12 (not 15) and therefore her relationship with Humbert is (or was in 1955) all-the-more shocking. Because of its truly effective social satire, I would rate the first segment more than Five Stars if I could but rate the second segment (at best) Three Stars, hence the rating which appears above.
B000002H8F|5.0|This album sounds like nothing else done by any other artist or the pixies really. Trompe le monde has its &quot;sonic&quot; similarities but it's got a really different feel. On this one Francis gets some serious rocking out of the way real quick on &quot;rock music&quot; and more throughout but its mainly a trippy type experience. Only songs I don't love are alison and velouria (two popular ones) which are maybe the most convential pop songs on here. Absolut favs after dozens of listens: &quot;anna&quot; &quot;down to the well&quot; &quot;all over the world&quot; &quot;is she wierd,&quot; &quot;blown away&quot; &quot;havalina&quot;......all of them really. Don't miss this one for the love of god!!!
B00000IIXH|3.0|Unless you a Bruce-aholic or a Boss-a-maniac, don't consider this a must buy. Some interesting stuff to be sure, but no big ones or hidden gems. You're not missing much by skipping it. Growin' Up is a very young Bruce and a guitar in studio. Seaside Bar Song is ok. Best tracks, and the only good reasons for buying this disc, are Pink Cadillac and Janey. I don't know where else you would get them, except here, or on the Tracks box set. There's a reason why Bruce left these songs off his other albums and it's a simple one -- these are just not as good as the songs we all know and love. Maybe the Tracks box set has some good stuff on it, but based on this sampler, I'm not spending [money amount]to find out.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Before the overblown Titanic and True Lies, James Cameron was a genre film-maker with few peers. The taut tension of his first Terminator movie made him a natural to have a stab at one of SF's great monsters. And this time, as the title suggests, there are more than one of them.<br />As in the first movie of the series, it all starts quietly. Ripley wakes in an orbiting hospital facility to find she has been rescued from her \\"lifeboat\\", having spent fifty-seven years in hypersleep.<br />The Company blame her for the loss of the Nostromo, and she is stripped of her officer's license. Humiliated, and bothered by nightmares, she is reduced to running \\"loaders\\" (futuristic fork lifts which cover your body like a mechanical suit) in the space docks.<br />That is until Burke, a company man, arrives at her door to tell her they have lost contact with a terra-forming colony on the planet she first encountered the alien. Ripley is persuaded to join a mission to the planet, alongside Burke and a troop of bad-ass marines.<br />There are some great SF interiors in the ship, and the marines have suitably bashed and battered weaponry, while still looking sufficiently futuristic, but the film drags along for a bit at this stage, with too much exposition and not enough action. But that all changes when they reach the planet.<br />They find a deserted colony, the rooms and walkways showing signs of a violent struggle. The only survivor is a young girl, \\"Newt\\", who becomes Ripley's surrogate child. (Incidentally, the special edition of the DVD has an early scene reinstated that explains why Ripley forms such a strong attachment to Newt, and is well worth watching for an insight into Ripley's state of mind.)<br />When the colonists PDTs (Personal Data Transmitters) are all found to be broadcasting from an area under one of the cooling towers, the stage is set for a series of mind-blowing action sequences.<br />At their first encounter the Marines get overrun by the Aliens (\\"In case you haven't been paying attention, we just got our a**es kicked.\\"), then their escape craft crashes, leaving them stranded on a site that is in danger of exploding. They retreat to a sealed compound to consider their options. (Again, the Director's cut has added scenes here, where heavily armed robot sentries keep the Aliens at bay at the compound perimeter.)<br />From here on in its a roller-coaster of climaxes till the end - Ripley and Newt are trapped in a locked room with two face-huggers (released by company man Burke to try to get an alien embryo back to Earth); the Aliens break into the compound for a climactic battle; Burke gets what's coming to him; Newt is taken by the Aliens; Ripley fights to get her back and, finally, we get to find out where the Alien eggs come from.<br />Ripley's stand off with the Alien Queen is one of the great images in modern SF and you'll be gripping your seat with tension long before the ending.<br />Sigourney Weaver carries this movie, dusting off her action heroine credentials once more, and is ably assisted by Michael Beihn and Lance Henrickson. But as in all monster movies. it's the monster that's the important thing, and the special effects people can take great credit from this movie - the Aliens are among the best screen creatures ever created and the Queen is a work of art, like some warped dinosaur skeleton painted in high gloss black and brought to life to stalk our nightmares.<br />Whereas Ridley Scott made a great SF movie in \\"Alien\\", Cameron has made a great action movie. The last hour of this film contains enough tension, emotion and excitement to leave you rung out by the end.<br />I recommend you watch it on a big screen with the volume turned up to eleven and let it take you away for a while. Just don't leave before the credits - there might be another climax yet to come.case you haven't been paying attention, we just got our a**es kicked.\\"), then their escape craft crashes, leaving them stranded on a site that is in danger of exploding.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This was completely unexpected. You'd never assume that a film like Donnie Darko could exist under the tag of, well, Donnie Darko. But, this film is incredible. No real reason to try and explain the plot, I probably couldn't if I tried, but suffice to say, all around the film is amazing. The acting is incredible, my thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal for pulling off an amazing performance (same can be said for his acting in Highway, though it's a completely different performance for a completely different film). But, screw everything I just said, watch the movie, better yet, buy it, and make all your friends buy it.  It's a film every movie fan, hell, every person in general should experience. Don't expect a happy ending, but it will undeniably leave an imprint on you long after the credits have ceased rolling.
B0000024RZ|4.0|I really like Dylan's music, lyrics, how he plays the guitar and harmonica, he's a great artist. This is one of the first Dylan's records i bought and still one of my favorites. His not-so-good voice sounds perfect for this songs. Hear &quot;Only a pawn in their game&quot; and &quot;One too many mornings&quot; and enjoy.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This album moves from one song to the next as if it was lifted from a Broadway musical.  In order to truly appreciate its concept, I'd highly recommend sitting down with the liner notes (and lyrics) and following the story along as it goes.  <br />On this album, Prince gets back to making damn good music (the LIVE drums-provided by the impeccable John Blackwell-were a welcome break from the worn-out drum machines).  Much of the title track is instrumental, with jazz saxophonist Najee accenting on soprano.  \\"Muse 2 The Pharoah\\", the album's \\"I wonder if she's the one\\" second track, let's the neo-soul newcomers (D'Angelo, Maxwell, etc.) know who the king of this genre really is.<br />Prince is convincing in many styles, and I salute him for not being afraid to mix these styles on the same recording (unlike others who stick to a proscribed formula).  Check out \\"Everywhere\\" and it's frantic drum breaks.  You can almost see a crowd of revelers dancing around in orgasmic ecstasy.  Or check out \\"Wedding Feast\\", which prominently features a harpsichord for God's sake!<br />Many amazon.com reviewers have complained about the subject matter touched on in this album (religion, vegetarianism, racism, etc.), but these people are missing the point.  When Prince sings \\"you still got your family name\\", he expresses a sentiment I've often felt when a hear one of my white brothers and sisters speak proudly of their Scottish or Dutch ancestors, while I, as a African-American, can only resentfully speculate as to my original \\"family name\\".  This was obviously a thorny topic for many white reviewers, and I guess that ruined for many the \\"flower child\\" image Prince had cultivated through the years.<br />\\"She Loves Me For Me\\" is a beautifully constructed love song (which I used during my wedding last year) with virgin-tight breaks and sweet rhythm guitar.  The last several tracks don't follow the \\"story\\" of the first songs, but they fit the mood of the album nicely (the legendary bass player/Sly and the Family Stone alum Larry Graham puts the funk down on a couple of tracks), particularly \\"Everlasting Now\\".<br />Get this album, listen to what is being presented, and don't let the \\"preachiness\\" blind you to the fact that there is no artist out there as talented and capable as Prince.  Trust me, your money won't be wasted.
1401200613|2.0|The art of Lee is nice like all his work men strong, women hot. I can't deny that, however, his Joker is the worst I've ever seen. But the story, well... maybe it would be great in 1 or 2 issues, but not twelve!!!! I think is sucessfull because Loeb know how to write the last page of each issue to keep you waiting for the next, but in two or three years when people can get the book all together, it would be forgotten. Batman look sometimes like a cyborg, sometimes like a fool, sometimes like the bad guy, but never like the DETECTIVE that he is. If you want a really great Batman's story read anything that Frank Miller had wrote.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is an incredible CD. The music is uplifting and Enrique sings like his heart is fully into the music. It is one of my favorite CD's. I have all of his music and this is my favorite by far!
B000002WCJ|5.0|I think this album surpases the one before it by just a little bit. Songs like Eagle Fly Free, I Want Out, and March of Time are classics. Too bad that this is last good Helloween album. If you want to get into this band, I suggest starting with part 1. Then moving to part 2. Skip everything else after this release. Some other good bands to check out would be Freedom Call, Gamma Ray, Heavenly, and Insania (all with similar style).
B000002JSJ|5.0|This cd is always overlooked.  This cd starts out with an amazing song, Achille's Last Stand.  Now the middle tracks are good, don't get me wrong, but they don't blow me away.  Now you are probably wondering why I gave this cd 5 stars.  Simply for the last song on the cd, Tea For One.  This song is dirty bar blues at it's finest.  By far my favorite Zeppelin song out there.  Right behind it is Going to California and No Quarter for my other favorite Zeppelin songs.  But Achille's last stand is up there on my list and like I said before, this album is worth the purchase just for Tea For One alone.
B000002W9P|5.0|When it comes to getting into a new genre, I always say start with the classics. This album in my opinion is one of the greatest power metal cds, and if you start with some of the newer stuff you may pass this one up as nothing new. Well don't let that happen, Future World is a killer song, one of Helloweens best. Don't waste your time with any of their new stuff, just go out and buy this(and part 2).
B00008D1NF|4.0|This appealing recording features strong vocals,<BR>expert, relaxed playing and a nice contemporary &quot;world&quot; groove.<BR>Mostly acoustic, it features great guitar and percussion and combines elements of folk and jazz with a contemporary Brazilian sound.
1587880784|5.0|It had been several years since I watched the film, when I listened to this audiobook, and I remember not really liking the film very much.  This book; however, is great and is probably one of the best, if not the best, science fiction books I have ever read.  The story is compelling and interesting all the way through, but the best part of the novel is that it makes you THINK.
1410102033|3.0|Many people would like to ban this book, Germany has already done it. Personally I think that banning words is the worst way of dealing with history. People need to read, they need to learn how to think: and one shuld prevent a book's attraction to rise, which does seem to happen, just as result of banning it in the first place.<BR>Read this book, take it as a historic document, build your own opinion. There is no good and evil in ths world, but there are prejudices and ways that lead to distruction of parts of humanity, which can only be a loss. Looking back into history, we know what this book has caused. In order to prevent such a history from happening again, we all need to read this book in to recognize a similar handwriting in our future.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|There are no other words - it is just a great example of a true artist nailing it. In this day and age when so called \\"artists\\" are cranking out discs with 2 good songs and the rest [garbage] - it is enlightening to hear from a master. Every tune is well produced - the lyrics resonate with the time - The band sounds awesome and Bowie's voice is perfect. Doesn't get any better than this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am really looking forward to this DVD ... Fox showed blatant idiocy in cancelling this series, after jerking it around in various days, timeslots, order, etc ... it had a great cast, the usual Joss chemistry and humor, a interesting concept and an intriguing storyline ... I hope it sells like hotcakes at IHOP, and shows Fox the error of their follies (and they're actually smart enough to notice, but that's a lot of credit).<br />Highly recommended!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Any true fan of Neil Young will probably have this on vinyl, but like myself I was to young to buy it in 1974. Neil is one of my favorite artist because he doesnt bore us by kepping his sound the same. He always sounds fresh and you know his music is pure. ON THE BEACH is a must have if you are a fan. Now that it has been released on CD, fans of all ages can truly hear how great this album is. When I found out it was being re-released, it was looking forward to that day and I can say that I am very pleased with this album. I've read so much about it and I was only familiar with 2 songs from this album FOR THE TURNSTILES, and WALK ON, both of which are great songs. REVOLUTION BLUES, VAMPIRE BLUES, ON THE BEACH are also great songs to listen to. The album is somewhat somber and dark, but the songs have great melodies and although Neil wont ever be compared to Pavoratti, he still sounds good here.  So I highly recommend that you add this disc to your collection. You cant call yourself a Neil Young fan and not have this in your collection
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC does it once again, making you reach way back to the dark psyche that lay once dorment in your mind but is brought to life by this uplifiting superb quality of art. Every song does its job in bringing you to its musical utopia.
B0000AOV85|4.0|First off let me say I was disappointed with this DVD because I mistakenly thought it would include all the songs from the Dark Side of the Moon in their entirety.  I was kind of hoping for a video montage of all the songs from the album.  Let’s be clear up front, this is NOT what this DVD is.  In fact, I think there is only ONE song that they play all the way through.<br />However, having said that, it was a very enjoyable DVD.  Giving tons of insight into the making of the album and lots of great acoustic &quot;this is how we did this&quot; type of stuff from members of the band.  Very informative, and in retrospect, an almost must have for big Pink Floyd fans.
B000066NW0|3.0|This CD has good lyrics. When I first heard \\"Complicated\\" on the radio I thought man this girl is dieing someone please help her!!! I later bought the cd...its brainwashing. I don't know if I like it because its good or if I like it because the devil told me to. This girl can't sing live. Doesn't write her songs. One min. she says one thing the next she says another. Now she has a problem with her fans copying \\"her style\\" which really wasnt her style Avril your not the first person to wear a punk t-shirt. Just the first to try to rip the style off. In a little bit she'll be gone. Her band is very talented though...they shouldn't waste their time with a person in need of medication and singing lessons. Well if you don't have this cd you should buy it...its addicting I dont want to be the only one who the devil talks to!!!!!
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is tied (with the Matrix &amp; Amlie) as one of my favorite movies. Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles make this movie amazingly funny and great. Allison Janney's cameo is priceless. My sister and I have quoting contests with this movie. If you don't love it, there's something wrong with you. Really.
B000099T2L|1.0|From bootylicious to canned spinach. Girl this Cd is Dangerously in need to become a mirror or something useful. I don't mean to hate, but if you listen to this cd you will understand. I was a big Beyonce fan. I really think this album was rushed and had to many guest artist. I seriously think if she were to tape sounds of herself going to the bathroom and try to sell that she would get the same results. The only good song is &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; backed by JayZ. Sorry Beyonce better run back to Destinys Child. You nor Kelly Rowland are going to make it far by yourselvs.
B0000640VO|5.0|When I first started watching Amlie, I, like many ignorant people, was somewhat put off but the idea of having to read my movie. I soon got over that fact and was encaptured by the movie's aesthetic beauty. The characters are all portrayed wonderfully. Audrey Tatou is a perfect match for such a quirky character. Mathieu Kassovitz is handsome and a great love interest. The colors jump off the screen, and the music is enchanting. I even bought the soundtrack (a great buy as well.) I don't have the capability to convey the amount of pleasure this movie gives you, not to mention laughter, love, and hope. This is one of my favorite films ever.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|Here I go again... Waiting eagerly for another opportunity to get a CD by on of my favorite bands of all times that it´s as good as their fame and past glories. Nothing again...<br />Dance of Death is good, just it. This beloved band has been plagued by strange decisions made over and over again by its boss, Steve Harris. Check some of them:<br />a) Janick Gers. Nothing against him, just against his playing and stage performance. It´s simply horrible, junk. Dozens of superb guitarrists around in Britain and Steve hired this guy. Amazing. Maybe he´s a nice fellow.<br />b) The obnoxious technique developed by Steve, around mid-nineties, to repeat a chorus endless times, making almost all the songs pass the seven-minute mark, for the sake of what? To make the album pass the seventy-minute mark? Why??? It makes great potential songs just boring!<br />c) The &quot;indecent&quot; cover art of Dance of Death, Why, Lord, Why?!!!<br />Well, anyway, the album is good, better than most of the modern bands of today. I just keep guessing how better it could be.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Word is Universal picked up the rights to this one for a movie deal.  Don't be surprised if post-movie the series reemerges on UPN with some retooling.  This might be the first chapter in a classic series.  Here's hoping.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Here are the Beatles' best recordings from 1967 to 1970. I described the design of the Apple label in my review for the 1962-66 set. This set is blue(the label background,the cover border and the CD panel). Now the songs: SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND tracks are the title track,WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS,LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS and A DAY IN THE LIFE. The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein fatally overdosed on drugs in '67. From MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR are the title track,THE FOOL ON THE HILL,I AM THE WALRUS,HELLO GOODBYE,STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER,ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and PENNY LANE. LADY MADONNA is cool. HEY JUDE was written by John Lennon for his son Julian and sung by Paul McCartney. On this set is an alternate version of John's REVOLUTION. This is not the same version on the \\"White Album\\"(that version is entitled REVOLUTION 1). George Harrison's personally penned WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS,HERE COMES THE SUN,SOMETHING and OLD BROWN SHOE are on this set. Ringo Starr's OCTOPUS'S GARDEN from ABBEY ROAD appears on this set also. From 1968's \\"White Album\\"(the group's self-titled album) are BACK IN THE U.S.S.R. and OB-LA-DI-OB-LA-DA. Paul really kicks with his song GET BACK. DON'T LET ME DOWN was an outtake. THE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO is the fairy tale of the 1969 wedding of John and Yoko Ono and the honeymoon that followed. On March 12 that year,Paul and Linda Eastman married and John and Yoko's wedding commenced eight days later. John's kicking COME TOGETHER really rocks. It was later covered by Aerosmith and Michael Jackson. LET IT BE,an alternate version(not the version on the album of the same name),has a religious theme. Two other LET IT BE tracks are ACROSS THE UNIVERSE and THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD. Personal and managerial differences caused the Beatles to disband in 1970. Also,then all four Beatles were married. Each Beatle moved on to individual solo careers.
B000002KK2|5.0|I first saw Rickie Lee Jones on Saturday Night Live, playing the song Coolsville from this CD.  It was interesting to me that Chuck E's In Love was the hit but she deliberately did another song.  I thought then (and think now) that she picked a better song than the hit and that seems to be the way she manages her career.<br />Rather than go for the easy commercial songs, Rickie really seems to prefer to go with better, higher quality music.  Its a professional decision that I think is admirable and this is something like the third version of this album I've bought.<br />Great stuff...try it, you'll love it.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Here are the Beatles' best recordings from 1962 to 1966. The front cover photo was taken in February 1963 at the EMI Studios in London. However,the Beatles didn't become popular in America until 1964. An album called INTRODUCING THE BEATLES was released in America in '63 but it didn't sell so much then. In 1993,Apple Records was refounded in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of ite initial foundation by the Beatles. The Apple label was designed by Gene Mahon. CD 1 features a whole granny smith apple and CD 2 features a halved granny smith apple with the sliced side seen. This set has a red background like the border on the cover and the compact disc panel. Now the songs: LOVE ME DO was the Beatles' first hit ever(in the UK of course). PLEASE PLEASE ME is from the album of the same name. FROM ME TO YOU is an enjoyable love song. SHE LOVES YOU really rocks. I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND was a hit when the Beatles came to America for the first time in '64. ALL MY LOVING is Paul McCartney's love song. CAN'T BUY ME LOVE,A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and AND I LOVE HER are from the Beatles movie entitled &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;.EIGHT DAYS A WEEK and I FEEL FINE are cool. From the Beatles' second movie HELP! are the title track,TICKET TO RIDE and YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY. There's Paul McCartney by himself with another love song of his,YESTERDAY. WE CAN WORK IT OUT and DAY TRIPPER can really rock. RUBBER SOUL tracks are DRIVE MY CAR,NORWEGIAN WOOD(This Bird Has Flown),NOWHERE MAN,MICHELLE,IN MY LIFE and GIRL. PAPERBACK WRITER is about an aspiring novelist. REVOLVER tracks include ELEANOR RIGBY,which is again,Paul by himself with a string quartet instead of his three fellow Beatles,and YELLOW SUBMARINE,later recycled for the soundtrack album of the same name.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Musicals have changed. They used to portray a fantasy world, some might say a phony world of sometimes overly sweet &quot;happy&quot; people. Now musicals are more realistic and seek to tell a story with solid content. Such is &quot;Chicago&quot;. This is a story of real people; their hopes and fears, what drives them, and the inner demons that they must overcome. I found the story gripping, emotionally captivating, and ironically amusing. And, the music is superb. Every song is melodic and memorable, and the lyrics are first rate. Some person complained that the movie &quot;symphathizes with killers and those who set them free&quot;. Hogwash! It actually pokes serious fun at a system where this is allowed to happen. This is called &quot;satire&quot;. Go borrow a dictionary and look up this word. As for the old style musical that some individuals praise and celebrate, some are good, some are ok, and some dreadful. I love the songs from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; but I cannot sit through it's hours of cotton candy sticky sweet mishmash. It's Horrible, Simply Horrible. I suppose that this review will not sink into the gray matter of such individuals. It will just hit a Wall of Obtuseness.<BR>Musical drama should make you think. It should be more than just tap dancing and champagne bubbles. For that watch Lawrence Welk.
B00006EXL5|5.0|MCR rocks my socks off. they are so good. i should rape them.
B00004WC6J|5.0|a magnificent collection of golden songs from some other universe - where art takes precedence over commerce and true vision rules.<br />I have a slight problem with the packaging of this work. Everytime I open it the flimsy plastic center pieces designed to keep each cd in place, which broke apart, cause the cds to fumble around and possibly get scratched. The manufacturers should have the same standards that the music executives building homes in Malibu do! Provide us something that helps us better store our music.<br />Sylvian is an incredible musician/artist who should not be faulted. His catalogue is highly impressive and thoroughly satisfying.<br />Enjoy, but make sure you quickly preserve the songs before the packaging destroys them!
B000099T2L|5.0|Finally, the solo CD from Beyonce.  This is the one everyone has been anticipating. Well the anticipation is over and here it is--&quot;Dangeroulsy in Love&quot; this CD is very well produced and packaged.  Beyonce is a very talented young lady that can sing,dance,act,write and produce songs and this CD demonstrates her talent and staying power in the entertainment industry. The success of &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; is no Fluke. There is a real quality in the songs and music.  Beyonce has put together a CD that has the old school flavor and the new school beats&amp;mixes with a twist of neo soul and funky R&amp;B. I like it a lot.  The title cut &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;  and &quot;Bad Boy&quot; are clearly new school but contain plenty of Soul and funky beats. My favorite song on the CD is &quot;Yes&quot; that is my jam! I also like &quot;Me,Myself and I and the duet with Luther Vandross-real old school love and storytelling in all of these songs. Beyonce is saying something and telling a story with her music-the words have meaning-which is missing in songs these days.I believe the song &quot;Naughty&quot; will also be a hit-it has a rock-funk base. I also like &quot;Dangerously in Love 2&quot; that is a very nice song. &quot;Gift from a Virgo&quot; and Missy Elliot's &quot;Signs&quot; are standouts on this CD as well. Beyonce is breaking out on her own-creating her own style - which is refreshing coming from someone that has been a member of a very popular and successful trio &quot;Destiny's Child&quot;. This is not a Destiny's Child CD---this is a Beyonce CD and I am very happy for the talented young lady from Texas.  Your &quot;STAR&quot; will continue to shine---just keep the faith.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show had some of the best dialogue in a long time.  The characters were well-defined and consistent.  All this, together with the post-Civil War motif (plus spaceships...) made this one of the best sci-fi shows since Babylon 5.<br />Buy it!
B00005OM4N|2.0|Okay first of all she never should have been allowed to do a cover of Joan Jetts I Love Rock N Roll.  She totally ruined a great song.  She sounds awful.  She cant sing, I dont understand why people cant hear that.  Her voice is awful.  There are a couple of catchy songs on this album but it's not worth it, save your money.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|I acutally like this CD. I've been playining it in my car every day since I purchased it. I'm just a little disappointed in the lyrical content. Apparently Erykah was on some serious weed when she wrote this stuff, or perhaps she was in a party mood and just didn't give a flip about the lyrics. This is strictly a party CD, not a chill-out-and-relax CD. No prolific lyrics here, just straight-up JAMMING - perfect for parties, driving to work, or exercising. <br />But I can appreciate an artist who's versatile &amp; unpredictable, one who doesn't drop the same old repetitive music on every new release like most contemporary artists do. I don't understand fans who expect to hear another Baduism or Mama's Gun this time around. If you want to hear Baduism, then drop that CD in your changer. This CD takes you in a whole new direction. <br />The best tracks are &quot;Bump It&quot;, &quot;Back In The Day&quot;, &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life Worldwide&quot;. But don't expect the &quot;Life&quot; version from the Brown Sugar soundtrack, this is a remix/sample of &quot;Funk You Up&quot; by Sequence from 1979 - but it jams nonetheless! &quot;I Want You&quot; is a great song, and I imagine Erykah could really work this song during a live performance. It's quite repetitive &amp; lengthy and it ends with some &quot;Funkadelic-ish&quot; guitar riffs (if you're old enough to remember the &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; and &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; days). <br />&quot;Danger&quot; really rocks, with some strong tuba or trumbone horns. (This song would be perfect for HBCU bands to play at football games to get the crowd moving.) &quot;Woo&quot; sounds like something they just came up with during a jam session in the studio, and &quot;Grind&quot; is strictly rap, with hardly any vocals from Erykah. <br />To sum things up, I give this CD 4 stars for the music, and one star for the weak lyrics. So if you want to party, get this CD today! But, if you prefer typical Badu and more substance, then keep listening to Baduism or Mama's Gun.
B00004SCX6|2.0|This album is not great but it does have the most catchy dance songs out of all her albums.  I wish she could sing better but her voice is so awful.  It's sad because everyone thinks she is so great but all she is, is a Madonna wannabe.  SHe will never have the lasting career that Madonna has.  Madonna is actually an intelligent, talented woman who has a lot to offer to the music industry.  Britney really has nothing great to offer.  SHE CANNOT SING!!!! Everything about her is fake.  Especially her voice.  It sounds so made up.
B000062YB1|2.0|I felt this album was a low point for Slayer. In a sense its like Metallicas Black album. I tend to forget about these minor setbacks in their careers. Seasons in the abyss was too mellow from a Slayer fan standpoint, I was hoping for something that kept in the lines of Slayers notorious, relentless song writing and brutal guitar riffs. This album was more of a whimper. It just doesn't do much for me at all. Its like just when you thought the lyrics were going to get good, someone was tapping them on the shoulder &quot;saying tone it down guys we can't have another reign in blood album style lyric&quot; . I like brutal Slayer music period and this isn't it!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I see that 551 reviews go before mine and that Band of Brothers is unanimously given 5 stars.  What else do you need to know?<br />Band of Brothers is the story of a company of American paratroopers [Easy Company] from training, through D-Day and allied fighting in Western Europe until the end of the war.  The characters and events are so memorable and compelling that I can see and feel them freshly in my mind although I haven't watched the series in some time now.  One of the things I like about this series is that it takes its time.  I was in the Army myself [noncombat] and feel that Band of Brothers captures each step of the progression towards company unity and the selflessness that I am most proud of possessing as a lingering positive from my time in the military.  I'm sure that real combat veterans would be disturbed by the series play towards romanticism.  While events and characters appear very realistically portrayed, the series does also represent the &quot;nobler&quot; aspects of war, such as sacrifice, camaraderie, and leadership.  We've all heard how real combat veterans generally (and naturally) refrain from talking about the horrors of war.  While I enjoy watching war-based and military documentaries, I'm sure those actual veterans might find such romanticism disturbing and perhaps hateful.  Even with that in mind, this series is simply outstanding cinematically and, most importantly, dramatically.  Perhaps in an attempt to bring the reality of war home closer to us, many episodes of the series open with first-person accounts from the actual men of Easy Company who fought in the war and remain with us today.  This shows a respect for what appears to be the way veterans view war and makes the viewer feel the suffering of the characters more.  It heightens the series' realism greatly and the special disk devoted exclusively to interviews with Easy Company veterans is worth the investment in the series by itself.  Do yourself a favor and own one of the finest things television has ever created.<br />David Schwimmer -- who knew?
0790730960|1.0|Michael Keaton's amazing performance,Catwoman,and the visual effects are the only thing saving this movie from being the worst film ever made.Danny Devito(boy he should have won that Razzie,and Christopher Walken,are horrible in this movie and the script is SO awful that a five year old could do better.I am so glad that Batmn Forever saved the series and Batman and Robin is 1000x better than this!Avoid this movie at ALL costs!!!!
0156027321|4.0|This was given to me by Chris Fry at work, and I started it when I left my then current book in Utah. I am not sure why but I was skeptical at first with this book. Possibly because Chris told me that in many ways it was similar to Peace Like a River, which I really really enjoyed, and was therefore a tough comparison to make. And initially I had a bit of a tough time getting into the book. But after the first 90 pages setting the stage I really started to enjoy the story. I especially enjoyed the religious discussions. An aspect of religion that has always fascinated my has been commonality. Most religions, including my own, stress exclusivity. Yann forces an examination of the one great whole circumscribing truth in discussing, Islam, Christianity and Hinduism. Something that struck me in particular was the central role of prayer in the Islamic faith, something that was common knowledge but I had never considered, especially in light of my own beliefs. Another aspect that I pondered on was the encounter with the divine. A lengthy quote from the book:<br />&quot;One such time I left town and on my way back, at a point where the land was high and I could see the sea to my left and down the road a long ways, I suddenly felt I was in heaven. The spot was in fact no different from when I had passed it not long before, but my way of seeing it had changed. The feeling, a paradoxical mix of pulsing energy and profound peace, was intense and blissful. Whereas before the road, the sea, the trees, the air, the sun all spoke differently to me, now they spoke one language of unity. Tree took account of road, which was aware of air, which was mindful of sea, which shared things with the sun. Every element lived in harmonious relation with its neighbor, and all was kith and kin. I knelt a mortal; I rose an immortal. I felt like the centre of a small circle coinciding with the centre of a much large one. Atman met Allah&quot;<br />Later on in the story he writes:<br />&quot;At moments of wonder, it is easy to avoid small thinking, to entertain thoughts that span the universe...&quot;<br />This made me question: &quot;When was the last time I encountered the divine?&quot; My daughter's birth? Holding Sofi for the first time in the hospital? Surely not the most recent, but certainly two of the most memorable moments. Another was recently at scout camp in Wolfeboro. We camped one night on a elevated flat of granite above and away from camps. The night sky wrapped around us with a myriad of stars, more than I remembered there being or had seen for a long long time. The milky way splashed bright and wide across the heavens, and laying there on my back I could all but feel the curvature of the atmosphere and the frame of space that spread out as the universe cradled around the horizon. The majesty of space and God's creation was awe inspiring.<br />Finally, and briefly so as to not spoil the meat of the story, I enjoyed the story of struggle. The mythology, the allegory and the tale of survival. Thought provoking, in a way reminiscent, though much more lyrical, of the story of the Essex.ments of wonder, it is easy to avoid small thinking, to entertain thoughts that span the universe...&quot;<br />This made me question: &quot;When was the last time I encountered the divine?&quot; My daughter's birth?

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When I first popped the CD into my stereo, I admit that I was slightly disappointed.  Yet such is the brilliance of A Perfect Circle that after letting the album settle in a bit, I now consider this one of the greatest albums I've ever bought.  <BR>    As is always the case with Maynard James Keenan's CDs, Thirteenth Step is WEIRD.  This is not mainstream popular music; it is far more daring and creative than most of what is out there.  Mixed meter, strange harmonies and haunting vocals (courtesy of Maynard) come together in an incredible amalgamation of alternative metal.<BR>    Some songs are, of course, better than others: Blue, A Stranger, The Outsider, Pet, and Gravity are all amazing, while most of the others are &quot;merely&quot; great.  At first, the fillers seem out of place, but they serve as welcome transitions when listening to the whole album at once.<BR>    All in all, a great purchase for anyone in the mood for something different.  Just let it soak in, and you'll see what I mean.
B00000DQSZ|2.0|I feel like I've stumbled into a Kraftwerk fan convention here, and a bit of balance is needed surely?  'Trans-Europe Express' and 'Metal on Metal' are magnificent shards of minimalist beauty, and rightly hailed by others on here.  However, 'Europe Endless' is a meandering noodle at best, and 'Hall Of Mirrors' is bilge beyond articulation - cultural commentary for those who don't know whether commentary has one m or two.  'Franz Schubert' has a kind of rococo irony in the midst of the other steely musical structures in which it is placed, and raises a wry smile - it being the culmination of the trans-European &quot;journey&quot;.  But let's get real here people, the only tracks even approaching necessity are the central high-points of 'TEE' and 'Metal On Metal'.  The rest are entirely surplus to requirements.  It should be noted too that this is not the only Kraftwerk album to suffer the same malaise!  It might even be argued that the central tracks are good enough to warrant purchase of this album, but I assure you you'll be programming your CD player to skip the rest.
6305897786|4.0|I remeber seeing commercials for this film, several years ago, and thinking that this was surely another mindless, hollywood b-flick, designed to lure in young teenage couples, and diehard horror fans.<br />I was way off, or rather, the commercials were way off. This is a mystery piece, dealing with the occult. I suppose I don't have to go into the plot, as you can read into that from other reviewers, but I'd just like to say that this is a quality psycological horror/mystery, that thinking people will appreciate.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Since Tool exploded onto the scene in 1992, Maynard James Keenan has been a powerful force in the fieldof challenging and expressive music. To call A Perfect Circle his 'side-project' would be to commit a grave fallacy though, as A Perfect Circle can only be viewed as a band in the classical sense of the word. Despite this, Maynard and Billy Howerdrel certainly emerged as the creative force behind the unit on their debut, 'Mer des Noms' which was a perfectly compact selection of biting and at times beautiful music, which pushed the band into a small genre of their own, with their transecndental melodies and spacious instrumentation. Since Tool's 2001 masterpiece 'Lateralus'my expectations for 'Thirteenth Step' have been running at fever pitch, and now its finally here it delivers in style.<br />Many people seem to look on A Perfect Circle as a kind of second rate tool,or a mellower alternative to switch to as mood dictates. This is most certainly not so. On 'Thirteenth Step' the band moves even farther toward carving a musical niche entirely their own. Indeed, much of the material here is drastically original, and the album holds together as a sprawling statement rather than a disparate collection of songs.<br />At first I was rather taken aback by the fact that thealbum seemed to abandon the ruthless consistency of quality that characterised 'Mer Des Noms'. the band have progressed to a musical space that is extremely dreamy and elegant, with heaviness used very sparingly, and each instrument contributing in almost equal measure to the whole. Opener 'The Package' is over seven minutes long, which I certainly did not expect, and it epitomises the album extremely well, combining ethereal lyrics and delicate guitars with Maynard's powerful vocals caressing us gently, then exploding into life as the song jumps in a heavy direction. The lead single 'Weak and Powerless' is actually one of the weaker full songs here, which is saying something, as its a very accomplished track, with a deceptively catchy vocal hook.<br />My standout tracks are 'The Noose', which seems to see Maynard attack organised religion yet again, and 'The Outsider' whose lyrics are violent and impulsive, with Maynard intoning 'disconnect and self distruct one moment at a time.....everyone will have his day to die'. As one of the heaviest songs present here, 'Pet' is also a definite highlight, with crunching guitars and somewhat worrying lyrics.<br />At the risk of undermining my authoritarian stance when it comes to music, I'd never heard of Failure before tracking down the original authors of 'The Nurse who Loved me', but I must admit the version on'Thirteenth Step' is superb, and is something of a departure for the band, being a quirky and almost comic number which is jam packed with hooks .I like it a lot, and will investigate failure as a result (which islikely what Maynard and Billy intended).<br />This review has become gargantuan, So I should round up by saying that Josh Freeses' drums are absolutely killer throughout this record, Billy's guitars are sweepingly original and tasteful, and the production as a whole is stunning, with incredible textures and vivid soundscapes combining effortlessly. My only gripe with the record is that songs like 'Crimes', 'Lullaby' and 'Vanishing' feel underdeveloped, despite being beautiful and dreamy. I do believe they add to the album's overall impact though.<br />A Perfect Circle are one of the most relevant, original and vital bands on planet earth right now, and this opus only serves to consolidate their postition as forerunners in a movement of intelligent and techical rock music that transcends the demands of the mainstream.<br />Hugely recommended.k, with a deceptively catchy vocal hook.<BR>My standout tracks are 'The Noose', which seems to see Maynard attack organised religion yet again, and 'The Outsider' whose lyrics are violent and impulsive, with Maynard intoning 'disconnect and self distruct one moment at a time.....everyone will have his day to die'.

B00009P1O5|1.0|When you're a big time rock star, you get to get away with junk like this. Ever the meticulous craftsman in the studio, Young took his first take work ethic to new lows with this garbage. No one really cares what the motivatiuons were for this dismal run through of simply stupid material, if you were dumb enough to buy it on vinyl, there's no need to attempt to resurrect your pride extolling this slagheap as an underappreciated masterpiece.<br />YIKES!<br />The musicianship is horrible: remember, this is Crazy Horse: try to imagine how bad horrible Crazy Horse must be. There are no lyrics worth preserving and Young sings like dinner's on the table and he better get in before it gets cold. Thanks, Neil. We all owe you one.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Nothing I write can truly show you the power of this album.  Like all Tool and Mer De Noms, this is something truly unique.  The songs actually speak to you, they have a life. Brilliance in music is very hard to find anymore, this album is a beacon.  Rare too is an album that you can put in and listen to every song.  This is all that and more.  It has some great surprises, and one in particular blew me away.  &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; might throw you at first, but it is such a beautiful song that it grows right into you.  I don't care who you are, what kind of music you like, where you're from, this album is genius.  You need to do yourself a favor and go get it right now.
B0000AM6K2|3.0|The worst thing is that this is nearly very good....<BR>Nearly....<BR>I've been listening to it now for a week and it seems so middle of the road. It always seems to threaten to become really good but never quite gets there....<BR>I already know that this won't be an album I will be coming back to again and again. I'd rather play an old Elliott Smith.<br />The 70's groove just doesn't do anything for me. It's well done and all but seems so irrelevant today.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought the CD on the 16th, went into my room and listened to it. I walked away glad I bought it on sale. Eventually I decided to give it another listen in my room. This time, some of the musicianship that is so much deeper started to appear. By the third time I listened to the CD, I would've gladly paid the &quot;normal&quot; $20 for it, and maybe more. This is not a CD to buy throw in your car and listen to while your driving around. This is one to be enjoyed for the things that busy life suffocates. At times I thought it mirrored the second disc of Melloncollie and the Infinite Sadness.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Most of these reviews talk about how much TV has become just like &quot;UBS&quot; of &quot;Network&quot;. This is most obviously true. I believe the media today sacrafices a journalist caught lying on occasion just to cover up the fact that they all lie. But the bigger message in this film is that the media or &quot;UBS&quot; specifically has become a mirror of the world; that we should see how false the  WORLD has become when we see this film not just how false telivision is. The most telling scene is not discussed in these reviews--the one where Howard Beale is taken to the Network head who tells him in god-like tones that there are no more nation states; there is no more democracy; that all those concepts are just that--concepts that have had their day and that the new nature; the new over-power is money and it's ebbs and flows and that all morality and ethics stand in its shadow. More than what tv has become this film is about what WE'VE become as individuals in this society.  <br />What's confusing and also intriguing about this unmentioned theme in the film is that once Howard &quot;sees the light&quot;; once he believes that god has spoken to him by way of the Network Head [Ned Beaty], he brings &quot;God's&quot; message to the show which the network head refuses to cancel even when it, because of its now sobering, depressing, rather than merely angry, message, begins to drop in the ratigs. Why would the chief exec allow this to happen if he truely believed in the bottom line he preached to Howard Beale? This satire is so tightly written that I believe there's a good answer here. maybe another reviewer can provide the answer amongst his or her review. Great film.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Ok, this CD (Thirteenth Step) has seriously grown on me in a very short time! The tone of this CD is much darker and deeper than Mer De Noms with a few exceptions like Gravity for example, but I'll get to that. The CD starts out with The Package which has a heavy drum beat at times and Maynard's tried and true classic Tool singing style. Gone (for the most part) is the frilly harmonic sound of Mer De Noms, at least for this song(Gravity is the exception to this). Next is Weak and Powerless which sounds musically like classic A Perfect Circle and the only complaint I have about that song is it could've been a little longer and Maynard could've stretched his vocals a bit more, but still a really good song and one of my favorites from the disc. The Noose is next which is another one of my favorites with Maynard once again focusing on spirituality, or his views of it. This song has a nice melody to it and when it gets going, reminds me of Depeche mode a bit as I could almost hear Martin Gore singing this kind of song..at least in part.<br />After The Noose comes Blue which is ok, not bad, but not one that stands out with me that much either, although maybe it will later on. Basically it has an upbeat sound to it and although its kinda catchy, it doesn't stick with you. At least it hasn't with me yet. <br />Vanishing is an interesting song that feels like it sounds. When I listen to this song, I imagine it as thin, transparent, dreamlike or like a cloud with not much to it but at the same time, its compelling to listen to and soothing in a way. It's his vocals that keep you grounded. Of course that's just how it hits me, you might feel completely different about it. <br />A Stranger sounds like a continuation of Vanishing only with more substance. Kind of mellow and Maynard seems to be exploring a different sound in his voice with this song as well as Vanishing. Next is The Outsider which is probably the most Tool- like sounding song in both vocals (similar to his earlier Tool sound) and also musically. Could be comparable at times with Judith. Crimes is one of the fillers songs where he sings/counts up to 10 with a cool melodic tune in the background. Not much more to say about that one other that its also very short at 2:35.<br />The Nurse Who Loved me is probably the most different sounding song of any song Maynard has ever done in both Tool and APC. No drums at all in this song, rather its completely melodic with his voice as the focus for the song with accompaniment of Violins and other instruments of that nature and almost angelic sounding high voices in the background at times. This is a song that is difficult for me to explain exactly and you'll have to form your own opinion, but personally this is one that has grown on me and I like it.<br />Pet which is my favorite song on the CD currently, sounds like a nice blend of early tool vocally and the best of APC musically. I could've seen this song being on Tool's second CD, Undertow. Put these two sounds together and you have the song that I think will be their next single. This is also one of the new songs they sang during Lollapalooza. Lullaby is a continuation (another filler) of Pet and is the shortest song on the CD at 2:02.<br />Finally we get to Gravity which also another favorite of mine and one I feel could've/should've been on Mer De Noms. I love the harmonic sound that is truly the sound of A Perfect Circle and Maynard's alter ego. It's beautifully sung and played and its one of those songs that take you away to some distant place that's somewhat surreal. When it's over, you immediately replay it again because you don't want it to end. At least I don't.<br />Well that's it, that's my take of this CD, and I have to say I was somewhat doubtful and more to the point, fearful that their second effort of Thirteenth Step wouldn't live up to Mer De Noms (still one of my favorites), but I'm happy to say, I was wrong
B00005JM09|3.0|Robots taking over the world thanks to an evil supercomputer.  The way technology is going, I could see this very possibly happening.  The only problem is, what would the robots do with the world after they take it over and kill all humans?<br />This was the 1st terminator movie that I have seen that was in the theatres.  My only other terminator experience was T2: 3D that's at the Universal theme parks, but the movie didn't have the most complex storyline, and I knew the basics, so I figured out most of it.  How was the movie?  The special effects were great.  Industrial Light and Magic did it again.  Besides from that, the dialogue was weak, the story was very predictable, and they told you what would happen next in the movie constantly so there were no suprizes.  It also seemed like Arnold wrote himself out of the series if they do make a next one by killing his robot self and the world was basically destroyed at the end of the movie.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Okay, the first three songs of this CD just jump right out and grap your attention. Super grooves. Remind you of everything you love about DB. Then, things don't get BAD, they just get moody.<br />Okay, lets review the songs:<br />1. New Killer Star. This song is just great. A really good song that I feel will make the next greatest hits cd that DB puts out. I love it, very catchy, and you really feel that DB is saying something important although you might be hard pressed to explain exactly what it is that is so important... but that is what makes DB so interesting. 5/5<br />2. Pablo Picasso. A cover song... but DB makes it his own. It is, again, ear candy to listen to. I really enjoyed this song blasting out of my infinity speakers in my Jeep Liberty. Woo hoo. 5/5<br />3. Never Get Old. After hearing this song, I thought... WOW, DB HAS THREE SONGS IN A ROW THAT ARE SUPER. this song is fun and every fan of DB will love it. 5/5<br />4. The Lonliest Guy. This song is a bit odd, but not bad. The mood swings from aggressive to ... something else. Good song, but sort of a letdown after those three great songs to kick it off. 3/5<br />5. Looking for Water. this song picks it back up, and I really like this song a lot. you can get up and tap your feet to it. 4/5<br />6. She'll Drive the Car... a great great song, and I like the odd sounding harmonica beginning it all out.... But again, the song sort of puts you in a strange mood listening to it. The chorus is sorta spooky, but it really carries the song. 5/5<br />7. Days. Skiffle beginning. bouncy and acoustic'ish. I really like the power introspective'ish message to what could be an early skiffle Beatle sounding background music. Very powerful. 5/5<br />8. Fall Dog Bombs The Moon. WTF? A great song, but I have no idea what is going on. A driving intro, with good bass lines. Seems to be a lot of anger in this placid song about .. something.. the music is good, but not powerful. But hey, this CD so far has been pretty darn good, and this song is not bad, but just doesn't grab you. 3/5<br />9. Try Some, Buy Some. A good GOOD G. Harrison song that DB does complete justice to. I enjoy it, so it gets 4/4<br />10. Reality. Nine Inch Nails meets DB on this song. Sounds like a song that could very well be off of the EARTHLING or HOURS releases by DB. I like it. 4/5<br />11. Bring Me The Disco King. Okay, this song is the king of the moody pieces. Very odd, and strange, and not at all like anything DB has done so far.. matter of fact I am not going to rate this song yet, due to the fact that I am not sure if I like it or not, therefore it might be too soon to give it a grade... but trust me, the music is not bad, it is just different and interesting...<br />All in all this CD is a good 5/5 due to so many good songs on it. If you can find any music out there that has 5 songs that are top shelf on one release, I suggest you get it.. therefore, if you like good music, a great singer and a deserving product.. buy this cd. There are some songs on this release that are not great, but it isn't due to bad songwriting, it is due to DB doing something that he normally would not, and that is not bad in itself.good, and this song is not bad, but just doesn't grab you. 3/5<br />9.

0688163173|4.0|I rarely read mysteries but I'd heard so much about the shocking ending of &quot;Shutter Island&quot; I just had to see what the fuss was all about.<br />This book is definitely a page turner and it is very well-written.  I have to admit, I was engrossed.  Now, about that shocking ending:  I was pretty sure I knew what it was all about before I was even one-third of the way through the book and, I was right.  This didn't spoil my enjoyment of the book, though.  Shutter Island is a very quick read and I don't think anyone could complain that they've wasted their time with this one.<br />Those who don't guess the book's ending will probably be very surprised.  I felt more than a little manipulated by it but I'll say this:  Lahane plays fair.  There are clues aplenty strewn all through the book.  The reader only has to fit the pieces into the puzzle and it's really not difficult to do at all.<br />&quot;Shutter Island&quot; is by no means great literature and it sure didn't convert me into a lover of mysteries but it is a darn good read and one that will keep some readers biting their nails until the very last page.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Hollywood's steady downfall into high-priced visual theatrics and recycled storylines with wittless characters has done nothing good except reestablish my faith in the underdog.  \\"Donnie Darko\\" in this case, is one of those underdogs - a completely morbid and fulfilling storyline, with dazzling presentation and a cast of amazing actors playing multi-layered characters.  <br />The story revolves around the charismatic, wayward teenager, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  This troubled teen is the black sheep of his middle-class family, already having trouble with law for stealing a car and attending psycho-therapy sessions to handle his sleepwalking.  Only after a brief introduction into his life, does the movie immediately dive into the action - in a dream, Donnie is beckoned out of his house by an evil (almost satanic) looking man-sized bunny, Frank.  Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days - the 28th day being Halloween.  Back in reality, a jet-plane engine has fallen from the sky and crashed in Donnie's bedroom - Donnie survives because he had been sleepwalking.  Frank becomes a regular figure in Donnie's dreams and delusions - coercing him to commit random acts of vandalism and arson.  In the meantime, the world around Donnie Darko seems embedded with strange characters, mind-bending encounters and philosphical if not humorously poignant conversations.  Among these are are Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), the self-help guru, his highschool teachers: (Noah Wyle) - who is obsessed with the ideas of time travel - and (Drew Barrymore) who is disillusioned with the education system feeding into Jim Cunnigham , Grandma Death -a prophet of some sorts and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend and another troubled teen, who's mother is hiding out from an abusive ex-husband.  As doomsday approaches, Donnie's visits from Frank the evil bunny become more frequent, as he points out the relivance of time travel in his visits into Donnie's psyche.  Soon,Donnie realizes that many of his encounters with Frank, leave very real impacts on those around him.  (Spoiler:  For instance, Frank tells Donnie to burn down Jim Cunningham's house, that reveals a child pornography ring in his basement).  <br />All events and characters lead Donnie down to his final day, where he realizes that certain events have to take place and some people must suffer in order for others to survive.<br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" is magnificant in keeping one's interest, keeping its audience in suspense and sometimes in laughter.  Jake Gyllenhaal does a superb job of playing Donnie as a dark confused teenager in search of understanding and conscious, with the sexiness of Tobey Maguire but with a personality.  The dynamics of family make this story seem very real and close to home, as we are not only drawn to the supernatural, but to the plight of Donnie's mother, who is desperate to guide and understand her son.  <br />The basic story, visual effects and music are simple and play well off each other.  However, the much greater story and concept is certainly hard to understand and up for interpretation.  With time travel being a major theme, one might need to watch through the movie two or three times to finally have an idea of what actually happened in what order.  The ending (no spoiler, sorry!) can leave one with the questions: what just happened?... What did he accomplish? But the movie has enough of an impact and plain entertainment value, that I doubt anyone will complain about watching it over again.  <br />This movie is superb for a drinking games, Halloween parties or just sitting back and watching one stormy evening.  If you haven't seen it yet - you're missing out.  One day, film makers will try to imitate the magical properties that \\"Donnie Darko\\" has captured in about two hours.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|ERYKAH BADU'S fourth release entitled &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; is a hard listen at first. With a second listen i realized how much i liked this release. Badu is not an easy artist to digest sometimes. She doesnt sound like anyone else in r&amp;b (others have tried to sound like her) and she dances around the subject at times. <br />The music is first class with artist like ROY HARGROVE,ZAP MAMA,LENNY KRAVITZ and production from JAMES POYSER and DEAD PREZ BADU sets it off with the first single &quot;DANGER&quot;. A cut about being down for her man. Badu can keep it real and ghetto like no other. The posse cut with ANGIE STONE, QUEEN LATIFAH and BAHAMADIA &quot;LOVE OF MY LIFE WORLDWIDE&quot; is another standout track. <br />&quot;I WANT YOU&quot; is the real jem. A throbbing bumping bass drum beat turns into a mid tempo jazz jam in the middle. Badu switches gears with the best of them. The music is always controlled. The downfall of the cd is that given Badu's incredible range with her voice (just listen to 1998's &quot;LIVE&quot; release) she doesnt just stand still and belt. As powerful and meaningful as her lyrics are her worldplay and jazzy style can be tiring. Her voice is versatile and should be used as such more often. But that doesnt drag this release down too much. With bumping laid back tracks it is sure to please any fan of hip hop soul and the neo-soul movement.
0767817710|4.0|I will first agree with the negative aspects. This is not a western. As much as it looks like one, it really isn't. The dialogue could be easily placed in a new york gang atmosphere and flow fine. The way the characters act and their mannerisms doesn't fit the time period either. This I agree with.<br />But lay off it a bit guys. I can understand if you're fully gung-ho on westerns, and if theres one film thats masked as a western but actually contains more satire, you blow your top and dub the film a fake and a horrible act of God. True, there is a style of the great Sergio Leone's \\"The Good The Bad, And The Ugly\\", but that wasn't a western either. Spaghetti westerns were films that took place in the wild wild west, but were actually filmed in Italy, where they really had no clue what the west was like. So most of those westerns had a \\"light-heartedness\\" to them. Sergio Leone was famous for making a western seem comical. And I believe, Mr. Raimi just took that idea and did it again. Only this time with his directing flair, which is so fun to watch, I wet myself everytime I watch it (lets flash to the fight scene between spiderman and green goblin, supposed to be serious, but actually very light-hearted). During a showdown, Raimi would do an excessive amount of fast zooms on everything! The two guys fighting, the people watching, an inanimate object. I was laughing so hard! And of course, who can forget when the bad guy finally gets what he deserves via Raimi's trademark. POV of bullet! BAM! right in the face, followed by an \\"Army of Darkness\\" flip for a finale. My point is, this film is not meant to be taken seriously. But the plot was horribly serious, and Gene Hackman plays an evil man very well, nothing like his cowardly Lex Luthor role (bad analogy, my friend). So the mixture of the serious plot with the directing didn't quite fit. But thanks to Raimi, this film is filled with whacky camera angles, and comic uber spaghetti western themes. Thicker than spaghetti, linguine. Enjoy it!
0920668372|1.0|Another reviewer says this book should not be judged harshly becuase it is a metaphor...  What small child can understand the meaning in a metaphor this drawn out? This book tries to and does illustrate unconditional love, but travels down a strange road to do so. There are much better books out there like Guess How Much I Love You.
B00006F7S4|5.0|If anyone were to dare proclaim a musician 'today's equivalent of the Beatles', they would be hard-pressed to find a more worthy candidate than Beck.  Many of his talents are apparent from just a single listen: assured lyrics and melodies; deceptively virtuoso, chameleon vocals; rich, imaginative, respectfully derivative production and style...but the real comparison lies in his ability to reinvent himself, and his commitment to doing just that with each consecutive album.<br />This album is the quietest and perhaps most powerful Beck album I'm familiar with.  The bold satiricism of Midnight Vultures undergoes a 'sea change' into what could be called an 'older' Mutations.  If Mutations was a college student, vibrantly cynical and playfully yet bitterly sarcastic...then Sea Change graduated a long time ago.  It's subdued and achingly genuine; still sarcastic, but in the way someone truly wounded would half crack a joke out of habit or a desire to retain a degree of dignity.  If I were to sum up the tone in one word, it would be weary.  This isn't Beck the young poet prodigy, spontaneously spinning out webs of slicing observation borne of innate insight or keen wit.  This is Beck the experienced storyteller, aged beyond his years, reflecting helplessly on events and emotions that aren't theories, but tangible, often cruel overseers of the psyche's landscape and all that toils upon it.<br />Stylistically, this weariness is reflected in simple chords and progressions that become a kind of cradle, understated, sincere vocals, and seamlessly integrated references to country that bolster the inherent tone and content.  I wouldn't call myself a country fan, and mostly because of the very elements Beck here uses to such mesmerizing effect.  Give it a listen; anyone who's ever felt heartbroken, or tired, can't help but feel understood.
B000002H33|5.0|A lot of reviewers hesitate to place Master of Puppets at the beginning of the list of greatest metal albums.  You'll see it referred to as &quot;one of the greatest&quot; or &quot;possibly the greatest&quot;.  I have no such hesitation - this is THE greatest metal album ever crafted.  Metallica achieves this by seamlessly combining their trademark thrash with polished lyrics and haunting melodies.  The result is timeless songs that are often imitated and covered, but never surpassed.  It's no coincidence that a number of Metallica classics and concert mainstays are<br />taken from this album.  In addition, the shear variety of songs appeals to all preferences.  For those who love unrelenting thrash metal, we have &quot;Battery&quot; and &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;.  For those who prefer a more somber, haunting tone, there is &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;.  For those who like metal ballads, there is the title track.<br />For those who favor Metallica's post-Black Album work, you do yourself a disservice by not picking up this album.  This is Metallica at their finest, and I give it my highest possible recommendation.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was amazing, plain and simple. The character interaction was great, you grew to love (or hate depending on the character) each person on the show. There were tons of mysteries about each person that you were dying to figure out. Their adventures went above and beyond, \\"oh no, big space monster going to kill us.\\"<br />The dialouge was fantastic. The banter between the captain and his crew, the elegant speak of the prostitue and the use of mandarin chinese to curse was great.<br />I hated Fox for canceling this before all the secrets were revealed. Hopefully the excellent sales of the DVD and the Movie will bring the show back.
0446677450|2.0|I gave this 2 stars because the only reason to read it is to read the in depth analysis found on John T. Reed's website...<br />This is an amway/quixtar marketed book reinvented in a fictional (yes, fictional) forum.  Stay clear, as the book is clealry directed at people looking to get rich quick.  C'mon.  If it was as easy as this guy says, wouldn't everyone do it?  The book was written to sell to people looking to get rich who probably are far from it, and judging from the reviews on this website the brainwashing has apparently worked.
B00000K19E|5.0|WOW! I never understood the story maybe because I was just too young, but after seeing the movie for the 5th time or so it finally hit me like a book! The story line is like nothing else I've ever seen and the graphics and special EFX now that is definatley also something I havent seen in my life! <br />I absolutley love this movie the two most important things are there! Story+Action! and what a story and action! 5 star movie! Even though the movie is a little bit long, its something you can watch over and over without getting bored! Screw star wars or watever everyone thinks is unforgettabley the best! Because the matrix is No.1!<br /> When it comes down or what should I say UP to the acting performance's keanu reeves and the rest of the cast perform wonderfully and I MUST pull over to mention that &quot;Hugo Weaving&quot; who plays the top agent (Agent Smith) controlling the matrix which is everything, gives a wonderful villian acting performance that I love, No doubt my favourite character is Agent Smith. You cant go through the movie without thinking &quot;How cool are the agents&quot;! Later in the movie keanu reeves's character get some more character and shows us that wonderful black outfit!<br />Best movie fight ever is to be expected between Agent Smith and Neo.<BR>I love the way Agent Smith calls Neo &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot; it sounds so cool coming from him and it pisses off Neo!<br />Oh well yep,<br />THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!
B00005JLR2|4.0|O.k so people your right this one doesn't measure up to other Disney animated classics like \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"The Little Mermaid\\", but then again maybe that is not such a bad thing.  Anyone remember the little disaster in-a-box from 1996 \\"Humpback?\\" No well then count yourself blessed and spared by the divine hand of God   It was bad.  <br />This movie was not bad, not at all in fact I rather enjoyed it.  The storyline was solid if not wholly original and the graphics were great, sorta reminded me of Titan A.E only this movie got me to laugh once in a while whereas Titan A.E didn't.  The voice actors also seemed to have a fun time with what they were doing.  <br />The thing that killed this movie and why it so poorly at the box office was just the shear number of Treasure Island movies out there.  I'm sure that if this move had been a wholly orginal idea it would have been a box office smash, but unfortunately it was not.  <br />If you have the opportunity to but this one go ahead and do it.  This movie will surly keep both you and the kids interested.  On the plus side for adults the annoying singing is kept to a minimum
B0000AR8NK|5.0|What you need to know is this:  it gets better with each listen.<BR>It is almost impossible to say it's like another particular Bowie album.  I remember very well the Aladdin Sane album's initial popular and critical reaction was that it was a little like individual songs from each of the previous 4.  Same was said about Heroes and Scary Monsters. But over time his best stuff just grows and grows with each listen and really stand up quite separately as individual works of art. With few exceptions (Never Let Me Down, say) they are now almost all classic.  And so is Reality.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|The first Scary Movie is just 120 minutes of dumb jokes. Some of which are waaaay too offensive for younger viewers.<br />The second movie is a lot different. Its actually funny! I recomend buying part 2, and go to see part 3 next month in theaters.
B00008X5J3|4.0|Roxie Hart, as played by Renee Zellweger, craves to become a famous musical comedy star.  Roxie's boy friend promises to introduce her to his buddy who supposedly has connections in show biz.  The only thing Roxy's friend desires is to jump into the sack with her--nothing else.  When Roxy is faced with his lies, she takes her revenge.    Thus begins the story of \\"Chicago,\\" the razzle-dazzle musical about people who will seek fame at any price, whether via show business or indictment and trial for murder.  Either one of these is sure to grab headlines.  Richard Gere's character, the more than slightly sleezy lawyer, Billy Flynn, is more than happy to represent Roxy Hart, for a price.  Flynn also represents the singer/dancer and fellow felon, Velma Kelly, portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is in competition with Roxy Hart for renown.      The premise of \\"Chicago,\\" and a very cynical one, is how the press, hungry to sell newspapers, often thrust those least deserving into stardom.  Fame is fleeting; once the public gets bored with the latest flavor of the month, the media move on to the next flavor.  Note the case of O.J. Simpson, and his would  replacement, Robert Blake.  Of course, in between, Osama Bin Laden was abruptly forgotten in \\"favor\\" of Sadaam Hussein.    \\"Chicago\\" is a truly entertaining and enjoyable film.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, in real life is an honest to goodness singer and dancer, is simply wonderful as Velma Kelly.  Zeta-Jones' rendition of \\"All That Jazz\\" is a show stopper.  Renee Zellweger lends a little girlish quality (ala Marilyn Monroe) to her scandalously trampish portrayal.  Richard Gere's performance as the lawyer has just the right touch of slickness required by the role.  It is quite gratifying that although neither Zellweger or Gere are profesional dancers, they both turn in applaud-worthy and polished performances.  John C. Reilly, as Roxy's hapless and cuckolded husband, does a heartbreaking turn in his number, \\"Mr. Celophane,\\"the man everyone sees through because no one knows he is there.  Queen Latifah steals the show as the \\"lets make a deal\\" prison matron.  She is sexy and deliciously sardonic when she takes center stage in \\"When You're Good To Mama.\\"    My only criticism of \\"Chicago\\" is that while the musical numbers are often terrific, the movie too often feels a little bit overloaded with them.  I also often asked myself, \\"Is the public really so naive that they would fall for such obvious phonies\\" as dramatized in the film?  I guess that some people do have the need to identify with the latest, current fad, even if, as Andy Warhol said, the fame is over in 15 minutes.
B000059HB7|3.0|One aspect of this movie makes it stand out: Ricky Nelson as a young gunman NOT out to prove he can out-draw the world. Otherwise, it's just one more example of the movie lawman out to be a hero. Oddly enough, considerable evidence has been recently discovered for the fact that the &quot;lonely lawman&quot; (vide &quot;High Noon&quot;) was the exception, rather than the rule: more common, apparently, was the lawman who simply acted as a leader of many, instead of the sole bulwark against barbarism.
B00005JLSE|1.0|This is little more than a filmed broadway show. When I go to Broadway I want to see a play/musical and when I see a movie I want to see a movie. Don't let the hype fool you, Zeta-Jones did not turn in an Oscar worthy performance and who chose Richard Gere? Gere is a great actor and a lousy singer. He was doing a bad Anthony Newly impersonation. Best Picture of the Year? This just opens the door for Hollywood to make more lame musicals.
B00009XITQ|5.0|Name him, please.  Tell me she only fell for him in the movie, not life. :) <BR>Colin Firth is cute---for my mom, maybe!    But who was Daphne's boyfriend?  He is so handsome and warm.<BR>Is there someone for me, too, who will think I was born to stand out?
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Whenever anyone enters into a serious discussion about movies either contemporary or old, The Matrix is always mentioned and compared to other movies at some point.  The Matrix Reloaded, along with its predecessor, will be looked upon years from now much in the same way we now look at Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia.  The Matrix I and II really are extraordinary, both in terms of plot complexity and cinematic ingenuity.<br />The people who give The Matrix I and II bad reviews often say that the plot is shallow or not there altogether.  Most modern movies have the tendency to treat the audience like idiots and make the plot extremely easy to understand and follow, giving the audience a false perception of how deep the plot really is.  The Matrix does not do this.  Instead, the idea behind the Matrix is a philosophical one, one that you must ponder deeply in order to follow.  For some people whose cinematic taste buds have unfortunately been burned by movies such as Swordfish or Predator, this movie comes as an offense to everything they are used to.  Inevitably, therefore, many people will dislike this movie trilogy.<br />So, if you are tired of the same old action/violence/sex movies that Hollywood pumps out these days in order to make the most money, you must see The Matrix I and II.  They contain philosophy, social commentary, and in conjunction with artistic special effects, redefine modern cinema.
B000000H6Y|5.0|Type O Neagtive is one of the few bands that have an extremely gothic sound without the fast tempos and the screaming.  Scratch that...they are the only band with those styles.  This is such an amazing C.D.  I made a mistake with buying Life is Killing Me first (not saying its a bad C.D.) but there sound was too 70's for in that C.D.  I contemplated for a while, then I bought Bloody Kisses.  It was the most amazing arrangment I had ever heard from a metal band.  My other music (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Tool) couldn't compare to the sounds here.<BR>Christian Woman-The second greatest T.O.N. song ever written.  The melodies and bass noises are very good. <BR>Black No. 1-The greatest T.O.N. song ever written.  I love the lyrics and when they're all singing, it sounds so awesome.<BR>Kill All the White People-This song didn't really do it for me.  It reminded me alot of their first two C.D.'s, just not as good.<BR>Summer Breeze-This is by far T.O.N.'s best cover.  It sounds so metal.<BR>Set Me On Fire-This song is redundant in a good way.  I love Josh's singing.<BR>We Hate Everyone-What a great song.  This is T.O.N.'s roots at their best.<BR>Bloody Kisses-This song is so good.  I love the tempo and how slow it is.  The harmonies are so good.<BR>Too Late:Frozen-This song is like &quot;Misinterpretation&quot; from their first C.D.  Very well done.<BR>Can't Lose You-Very fine.  Very repetitive.  Love it.<BR>I think I forgot one but hey that's okay.  This is a must for any Type O fan.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Right now, the current genre leaders are John Mayer and Steven Delopoulos.  RFS is fantastic.  John's singing and guitar playing abilities are excellent, and this is a great CD to kick back to and relax.  Another fave artist of mine is a New Jersey singer/songwriter named Steven Delopoulos.  I caught him live in Cleveland recently, and he down flat BLEW ME AWAY!!!  His way underrated CD titled 'ME DIED BLUE' is a veritable acoustic rock/folk MASTERPIECE, with some tight backup musicians as well.  If you love Mayer, you MUST check out Steven Delopoulos.  His website is at [...]
B00009V7T2|4.0|First before i get into how much i like the album I am tired of all the people ripping the album because the lead singer of Mars Volta sounds like Geddy Lee of Rush.  Yes he does sound like Geddy Lee, get over it.  Rush are immensely talented musicians, simple as that.  The music of Mars Volta is very complex and cannot be fully appreciated with one listen.  By far the best song of the album is &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot;.  In six minutes, there is elements of The Beatles, Santana and Rush.  You are not going to find that anywhere else.  This song alone makes the album worth the purchase.  The only complaint i have is that occasionally the songs become slightly disjointed like they could have ended 2 minutes before they actually did or could have been completely different songs all together.  But other than that an excellent album
B0000041DF|5.0|Some complain about the recording balances on this disk.  I suppose they have a point. It is a live recording and sometimes you have to take what you can get.  At times things do sound a bit strange, but focus on the playing instead and you should be able to get over the recording issues in a hurry.  This is exciting playing.<br />If you compare these versions to, say, Horowitz's recordings of these pieces (and I think that is the league Argerich is playing in), you will find a different kind of virtuosity.  To me Horowitz at his peak still has greater control and especially more power, but it is just a matter of degree.<br />Argerich has a certain kind of mad excitement in these performances that make them her own.  She has fabulous technical control that feels like it is always on the edge of falling off the track, but she never does.  Just breathtaking!<br />These are two of the great piano concertos and Argerich is one of the great pianists.  These performances are memorable, maybe recorded less than perfectly, but still recordings you will want to have in your collection.  I have listened to this disk many times and still find it exhilarating.
0380789035|1.0|Unlike Gaiman, I'll keep my comments brief. His plot and storyline could have easily been condensed into a 50-page novella. The characters are one-dimensional and hollow. Much of his scenes and descriptions are filler. Gaiman could argue that gee whiz, that's the whole ironic, clever point! Still, it doesn't take 500+ pages to do that. By the way Neil, in case you didn't know, dream sequences are quite cliche these days.
B00008GKEG|5.0|To begin, I was not a huge Beatles fan. I loved their music, but did not really know much history behind the band. That changed when I met my wife, a huge Beatles fan. She convinced me to buy this set, and it was worth it. I now know more about the Beatles than I ever imagined. These DVD's are pretty much perfect. It is an extraordinary experience seeing and hearing the Beatles play in Dolby Digital Surround sound. I would highly recommend this set to everyone - Beatle fan or not.
B00006L83N|5.0|Another masterpiece from symphonic prog masters.After listening to divine wings of tragedy,V,and twilight in... I thought how can it be any better,well it does. First this album is different than V's sound it is much heavier.Like their former albums tis one has everything a prog band should have:Awesome virtuosity:(Romeo once again does incredible tapping jobs)Unsyncronized rhytms and amazing compositions. Last track is the best song whichonly it self can make the album a masterpiece.Amazing composition inspired by Stravinsky stuff.Buy this album
B00004TCPJ|5.0|Rachmaninoff was a great friend and mentor to Horowitz and they shared an affinity for melody, beautiful sound, wide dynamics, huge range of tonal colors, and drama.  I think this is a very beautiful recording of the concerto.  Though not as brilliant as the recording he made with Reiner in 1951, it sure is a better sounding recording.  It isn't that there is anything wrong with it, in fact it is brilliant, it is just that this older Horowitz had lost a bit on his fastball as it were.  But this is the recording, in its original LP release, is the one that I first heard this concerto and fell immediately in love and it still holds a tremendous amount of magic for me, especially since it is a live performance.  However, if you want to hear the peak of the Horowitz virtuosity get the RCA Victor Gold Seal Disk #7754.  It has the same recording of the Sonata, but adds some smaller works.  It is worth everything just for the recording of the Concerto #3 even if you duplicate the sonata.<br />The sonata is also a fabulous live recording.  The opening massiveness with its crash and roar is a pianistic sound I have never heard any other pianist make as convincingly in any place at any time.  It is absolutely unique in my experience and the whole performance is blindingly wonderful.  Horowitz has not only fused two versions that Rachmaninoff played, he also made some other changes he felt the composer would approve.  I believe him.<br />Be aware that even in live recordings, Horowitz would edit together multiple performances and could be very demanding in approving the final version.<br />Get this disk and enjoy these pieces.  It is great pianism and I believe it is something you should want to have in your collection.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist was, in my opinion, a great book. It is a book that teaches to not hold on so dear to the things in your life. It teaches you to be willing to sell what you hold so dear, so you can set out and reach what you really want to do in life.<br />Santiago was just a boy when he left his parents to go travelling the world (the world at the time) as a shepherd. But he keeps having a dream that cuts off at the point when someone is about to point to where a treasure is. He goes to a gypsy, to see if she can interperet the dream...I won't say the rest (but she doesn't add on much info). It's a great book with a great ending that'll leave you smiling.<br />It is an encouraging book, that can be interpreted in different ways. If you payed close attention while reading and asked yourself questions as you read about the characters, then you'll find it a great book, just as I have.
B00007AJGH|5.0|While I am not a fan of having to buy a movie twice on DVD, but this Vista Series DVD is worth every penny. The animated menus are funny, the extras are great, and the film itself looks fantastic. I am proud to have this DVD in my collection, even if it meant having to buy the same movie twice.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|First of all, I liked this album. not as good as Rumours or Tango in the Night, but still well done. Now, onto the dirt:<BR>I defitetly love what Buckingham has done on this album. The guitar playing on this album proves that Buckingham is truly insane. It seems like he's experimenting with some characteristics of heavey metal. His best tracks are definetly &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Bleed to love her&quot; and &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;. I have to say I was suprised by the amount of distortion used one &quot;Murrow turning over in his grave&quot; and &quot;Come&quot;, another reason I think he's leaning twords heavy metal.<BR>As for Nicks... by and large, she's good. Especially on &quot;Running through the garden&quot;, which sounds sort of like &quot;Isn't it midnight&quot;. Some songs, such as &quot;thrown down&quot; seem to have no meaning, giving that the lyrics point to Buckingham, and the two of them really havn't had any romantic heat since befor the dance. On a more critical note, &quot;Everbody finds out&quot; frankly, is the worst song Fleetwood Mac has ever produced (replacing &quot;sugar daddy&quot;). It sounds for to much like the pop produced by women in music today. Prehaps Nicks should remember that although she looks thrity, he audience expets her to act her age.<BR>Lastly, I do, however strange it may seem, miss Christine McVie.
B00005JKTF|2.0|I wanted to like Charlotte Gray. I'm a big fan of war stories, but I found this film to be drawn out, and at times tedious. Charlotte is a Scotswoman, selected to become a spy in war-torn France. When her cover is almost blown, she is hidden away in a remote farm playing mommy to two orphan boys.<br />While I enjoyed the cinematography, I didn't care for Charlotte's character. Her romance with the pilot seemed superficial to me. Her convictions to help France, had all the genuineness of a dogma spouting cultist. And, I'm sorry... But if I were selected to be a spy, I would hope I'd do more than play housekeeper. Come on Girl!<br />I had to give up half way through the movie. I just couldn't muster the interest to finish it. Perhaps if the story had been a little tighter and the characters a little more engaging....? Overall, I was disappointed.
6305499365|5.0|This film is probably one of the top ten funniest films I have ever seen. If you work in one of the millions of cubicals in America doing meaningless paperwork for a stupid boss and dealing with idiots for co-workers, you will find this movie hilarious. <br />Each character will remind you of someone you have worked with in your life (or maybe remind you of yourself). Peter (Ron Livingston) is a computer programmer who puts in endless hours at a job he doesn't like. He is asked by his many bosses to remember the TPS reports need to be done a certain way. What these reports are, no one seems to care. They just have to include a cover letter. His 2 best friends at work struggle with a copymachine that eats their papers. Some of his other collegues dream of making it big and leaving the company. Some have been beaten down so long by corporate culture that they go a bit nuts. Milton is a freakish little man who keeps getting moved to a worse desk. Milton mumbles and slowly plots his revenge. Will he have the guts to do it? <br />The boss, Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is a total jerk played with an uncany resemblance to every idiotic \\"manager\\" I've ever had. He swills coffee, talks about 'mission statements', and basically cannot manage anything. His \\"M-Kay\\" response to everyone is about all he can say coherently.<br />There is a nice subplot with Jennifer Annison as Peter's girlfriend who labors unhappily at her job as a waitress. Even in the service industry, the workers are subjected to their own moronic co-workers and judgemental bosses. The only one happy with his job seems to be Peter's neighbor who works outside in the fresh air as a construction worker.<br />The movie has many themes. I know some will dismiss this as a light comedy, but I feel you can read into things. Peter's lapse from good employee mindlessly droning on to a man who does his best to be fired, yet becomes promoted is very ironic. \\"The consultants\\" in the film remind me of other corporate types who really haven't a clue how to fix a darn thing.  <br />This is a funny film. You will be quoting it for days after!<BR>But, I urge you, if you have seen it on tv in its edited form, you have not seen the full story. Every time I caught it on tv, major scenes were cut off and I didn't quite get it. You have to see it on DVD or video. It is worth every penny.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Star Wars set the new bench mark for scfi film making previously held by 2001: Space Odyssey. This basically an action packed trilogy about good vs evil. The story is centered around Luke Skywalker who is drafted by obi won kenobi to recue princess Leia. Luke is trained to be a Jedi by Obi Won and Yoda. There are many classic monents such as blowing up the death star. Luke finds the power within him to do this task. THe movie consists of fantastic creatures and fantastic music by John Williams  This is pure hollywood magic in which a small farm boy grows up to save the universe.
014028009X|5.0|I figured I'd better go ahead and write my review of this book since I'm about to pick up the sequel to it. I loved this book. This is the book that started it all. Since Bridget Jones's Diary swept the globe, many writers have tried to &quot;borrow&quot; the premise, but nothing compares to the book that started it all.<br />I read the UK edition, so I was thrown off a little by the weight thing (which is in stones in the UK edition), but I got that all cleared out. Bridget Jones is a 30-something, single woman who's hoping to make a change in her life. She wants to smoke less, lose weight, and find the man of her dreams. She chronicles these hopes in her journal, and the result is hilarious.<br />This book is just a bit of light reading, and anyone woman, regardless of age or nationality, can relate to many of Bridget's age. Bridget is funny, smart, and cheeky.<br />She has a complicated relationship with her mother, and she has a complicated relationship with men. She gives her friends advice that she doesn't take herself, regrets not saying what's really on her mind, and cooks horribly. She's easy to relate to, and she's real. I will admit that there was a part near the ending, the scene where her mother got in trouble, that seemed a little farfetched, but it can be a overlooked.<br />There isn't much more to say about this book except it's fast paced and amusing. And now, I can't wait to get started on the second book.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I saw the Greendale Tour this summer. At first I was highly disappointed. I am a huge Neil Young fan, but I couldn't believe that he was performing a new album. It wasn't until &quot;Leave the Driving&quot; that the music and the concept began to work on me. That concert was one of the most amazing concerts of my life. Neil has tremendous guts to be playing a new album in rock opera form when he could easily be putting out albums that sound like Harvest and just play his greatest hits in concert, like the majority of the classic rock stars. Instead he took a risk, and it worked (I should note that the second act of the concert contained a mini &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; set as well as other Young classics). The album is equally amazing. Neil tells the story of a family and a town as a metaphor for the human condition, illustrating themes that are timeless and current. Listen closely, and you will hear a critique of the Bush Administrations policies(i.e. patriot act, environment, energy policy) as well as timeless themes like the importance of family, the wisdom of the elderly, and the idealistic energy of youth. The album ends with a call to take action. Neil sings &quot;We've got a job to do&quot;. Given the times we live in, and the policy that is being passed while most are numb with distraction, Neil's words are an urgent call to protect and transform the world.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Great album......why did i buy this when i already had the original?.....i dont know....still worth the money though.
630575067X|4.0|this is the long awaited prequel. Because of advances in movie making technology (I.E. Computer ANimation) the prequel appears more advance than the original series. The story begins with Gon Jinn rescuing Anakin Skywalker. He begins his training as a Jedi. In the nean time the trade giuld has established a blockade of the planet naboo. Gon Jin and Obi wan Kenobi go to the aid of planet naboo. There they face a dark Jedi called Darth Maul. He kills Gon Jin then Anakin is left in the care of Obi Won Kenobi. The story sets up the conflict between the republic and the enemy forces of the dark side. There is instability in the force and Gon Jinn believes Anakin can restore that stability but the Jedi counsel have doubts about the young Anakin.<br />.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As an Aussie I didn't have to go through the agonies of how this was broadcast out of order then crueally axed by Fox, and when I finally got to see the screened episodes (in chrono order via VCDs let by a kind friend) I was staggered at the difference in what I was reading on the Internet media sites about this show (predominantly negative) and what I was seeing (amazingly bold Anime-influenced genre-busting sci-fi which is presumably why Fox wanted Joss Whedon in the first place).<br />If Joss had been allowed to realise his vision for this show over seven series, I reckno it would have been his masterpiece.<br />The only sci-fi show in the same league (ie for adults) would seem to be Farscape, and that got canned too. The shift to undemanding \\"blue-sky\\" sci-fi seems unstoppable. <br />At lewst we can pay tribute and see the three unscreened episodes via this DVD. But surely that \\"Full Screen\\" is a mistake? If it doesn't come out 1:78:1, 16:9 enhanced, something has gone off the rails dang it!
B00003CXBH|4.0|Nominated for seven Academy Awards and taking in one for &quot;Best Cinematography&quot;, THE MISSION is director Roland Joffe's interesting drama.  Based on fact and scripted by Robert Bolt, the film is set in 18th century Spain, where a ruthless slave-trader (Robert De Niro) becomes a Jesuit as the Europeans attempt to remove the Portuguese from the land.  De Niro is excellent, but without the action of his normal performances, he's almost boring; Jeremy Irons as his &quot;mentor&quot; is terrific as well; there's also a good if not small performance by a young Liam Neeson, among others.  Ennio Morricone has a smooth, moving score that works well with the film's misty, sometimes relaxing production design.  It may not have deserved the &quot;Best Picture&quot; award it was nominated for, but THE MISSION is a calm drama to watch in your spare time.
B00008GKEG|5.0|WOW. What a DVD collection. This is by far the best collection of musical AND non musical DVDs my eyes have ever seen.

1587990717|5.0|Taleb seems to be confused as to whether he is a NOVELIST, a MATHEMATICIAN, an ESSAYIST, a TRADER, an ECONOMIST, a STATISTICIAN, and seems to have settled to be a NOVELIST --though almost a short story writer. <BR>Certainly a different type of book. Should not be found in the investment section but somewhere else. One thing: it is certainly not an investment how-to-do manual which is why it is fun. This is why those who bought it searching for rules to make money in the markets seem to be a bit disapointed.

There still hasn't been a band since<BR>1977 in which 2 guitarists engage in such intricate interplay.<BR>This isn't background music. To 'get' this band you must LISTEN.<BR>If you like Television, seek out Tom Verlaine's solo efforts of<BR>which there are many. You won't be sorry.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Worth the six Oscars, and more!  Engaging, entertaining, thought provoking, and brilliantly performed, Chicago takes us on a satirical journey through a sick and twisted society.  The casting is extraordinary, as every role is perfectly realized.  Bob Fosse's genius is matched by Rob Marshall's contemporary vision for the contemporary movie musical.  I waited a long time for the DVD, and am not disappointed.  I don't buy DVDs for all of the extras, I buy it for the outstanding quality of sound and picture.  Chicago is not pretending to be something that it is not.  Pure entertainment in a polished package.  Five outstanding stars.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I really liked the Led Zep DVD.......however in some of the songs the camera work was a little too fast and poor. But i cant complain too much because i enjoyed it greatly.
0385504209|5.0|This is a surprise reading adventure from a reader who bought this to read while my spouse read Tom Clancy's newest.  Soon each  of us was waiting for the other to put Davinci Code down long enough so we could sneak a peek.  It is such a compelling book that  we actually considered buying a second copy for a simultaneous read.  It is an intellectual trip for anyone interested in religion,  symbology, linguistics, and history. The historical accuracy is noteworthy.  At the same time, it is a mystery writer's masterpiece.  The ending actually brought a tear or two.  It will remain in my permanent library if I can recover it from the family members waiting to read it.
B00009RDG9|2.0|Blame it on The French Connection.  In that movie, William Friedkin gave film fans one of the most exciting chase scenes in movie history. While the Hunted is somewhat interesting, Friedkin seems to forget what made his earlier movie such a success:  it had a real story with real characters and the big chase was only one small portion of the movie.  In this newer film, the chase is everything.<br />Benicio Del Toro plays a government assassin who has gone over the edge and now is killing people in the forests of the Pacific Northwest.  Tommy Lee Jones is his former trainer who is now called in to track him down.  Initially this goes rather well, but soon enough, Del Toro escapes custody, and half the movie is little more than Del Toro escaping one dragnet after another. <br />This is a movie with a lot of unrealized potential.  The plot is almost too straightforward, with nary a twist in sight.  Neither of the two main characters are nearly as interesting as they should be, and the action scenes are relatively routine.  Although there are a lot of Oscars held by the people in this film, this is an average effort at best that exploits none of the skills of any of its participants.  While not awful, this is an entirely skippable movie.
0316666343|3.0|Lovely Bones, in my opinion, is not the story of Susie Salmon.  Rather, it seems to me that the author is trying to tell a bigger story, incorporating all of Susie's family.  (The title itself refers to the larger framework of what holds the family together.)  In attempting to tell a story of this scope, however, I think Sebold took on too much.  <br />For myself and many of the other readers, the book lost its claim on us once we got beyond its initial impact.  Is our focus the strain that threatens her parent's marriage?  What about Susie's sister?  her wacky but well-meaning grandmother?  Sebold would have done well to either limit the number of characters we follow, or limit the length of time in which we follow them.  Lindsey, Susie's sister, is a very spirited and interesting character at first.  By the time we've followed her to college, her character's essence has been so severely diluted that it's almost nonexistent.  <br />Within this unsatisfying whole, I did discover some gems such as the idea that, from crisis to crisis, a huband or wife usually has the other to \\"be strong\\" for them.  The tragedy of a murdered child, however, is a tidal wave that spins them apart even as it comes crashing down on their heads.  <br />I enjoyed the simple heaven of crayola colors that Sebold gives us; this certainly seems like heaven through the eyes of a schoolchild.  Of course heaven has swings!  <br />I also appreciate how Sebold blends eerie possibility into this fictional tale when Susie's young brother, Buckley, sees his sister.  Many people have observed something like this!  After my mother died, my young nephew would regularly look into the corner of the living room and smile.  <br />Unfortunately, I'm afraid Sebold lost control over her story when Susie returns to Earth.  To me, the \\"body-switch\\" feels false and out-of-synch.   For one thing, I can't accept that a girl who had been violated would experience her happiness through sex. <br />Don't let the hype getyou!  This book may boast an intriguing  premise, but it fails to maintain its promise.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence I, believe is one of the most talented bands out there in the music industry right now. Amy Lee's amazing voice sends chills down your spine. I have been to four live shows and it was one of the best experiences I have had. I highly recommend this cd to everyone!
B000031WD9|4.0|Ok, so it was gross, childish, immature, and it's been done many times before in better movies.  But, and come close so you can get this the first time, IT WAS FUNNY!!  From the beginning with the \\"sock incident\\" to the \\"pale ale\\" scene to the end with Allyson Hannagins character Michelle. My sides hurt from all the laughter.     So here's the plot, Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) make a pact one day at a party to lose their virginity before graduation.     Kevins plan is to work on his girlfriend (Tara Reid) till she gives in, Oz (the jock) tries his charm on a choir girl (Mena Suvari), Finch (a 40 year old in an 18 year olds body) pays a girl (Natasha Lyonne) to tell her friends a few flattering lies about him, and Jim is basicly all around hopeless.  His chances of getting any drop down to negative 10 when he's caught creaming his jeans from one touch of the lovely Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth).     Now everyones plans goes according to... plan until they all basicly sabotage them selves one by one, some get help and some don't need it.  But in the end everyone gets what they want.  The movie is funny even though the premise of \\"getting some\\" has been around the movie industry since the invention of the camera.  It's also been done better like in all the Porky's movies or National Lampoons Animal House.     Now in my review I left out a few people but the two I missed that we all know about are Stifler (Seann William Scott) and Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) and they basicly steal the movie.  Stiflers \\"pale ale\\" scene is hall of fame type stuff and Jim's dad giving Jim a little chat on sex is embarassingly funny.  Stifler getting revenge on Finch is real gross and you can't stop laughing about but the way Finch got back at Stifler in the end was probably one of the worse things you could do to a guy.     I can't really say much else about the movie because most of it you have to see for yourself and my review does the movie no justice.  So if you like to laugh take an hour and a half out of your day and check this out.     And for those of you who didn't like the film, deal with it.  The movie has already been made and is in millions of homes around the world and there's nothing you can do about it.  Your not getting your money back if you saw it in theaters, you can't return it if you bought the dvd, and you have to accept the fact that Hollywood will be making more of these movies down the line.  They make them, we pay to watch them, we laugh, we go home, they get our money.  You see the movie on tv do what I do when I see something I don't like (Ex: those phony religous shows or networks or Jerry Farwell), change the channel.
B000005Z0G|5.0|This was the first 2Pac album I got together with All Eyez On Me. Even though All Eyez On Me was the album I bump the most, this always got spins in my CD-player. What I love about Strictly 4 My Niggaz is the old school hip-hop sounding beats, the lyrics, guest apperances, Pac's flow and the variety in the music. You'll find most of party anthems, but you also get songs like Keep Ya Head Up (has to be the best on the album), Souljah's Revenge and a couple of others political issues. 2 interludes aimd at the then vice-president. Production by Live Squad, Shock-G, Raw Fusion and a numerous of others. Guest apperances comes from a hot list of rappers like Ice Cube, Ice-T, Live Squad, Digital Underground, Treach of Naugthy by Nature, Strech (Pac's true homie R.I.P.) and more. <BR>No songs are weak but of course some one are better than the other. Get this if you a hip-hop or 2Pac fan. Great music.
B0000636UN|3.0|Fresh off her triumphant Daisy Mae tour, \\"Sheryl Crow\\" (born Camilla Borghardt) changes gears and offers her fans something new on this, her sophomore effort. It's a gallimaufrical potpourri of loci delicti, garnished with an unexplained residuum of blank intervals, its harshness softened somewhat by elliptical postmodernish referencing strategies. And therein lies its weakness. Had she been content to simply neutralize the listening public's heedless indifference to global hegemonicization through inert fantasies of illusory dominance, she might have produced a masterpiece of indiscriminate flatulence; as it is, however, she oversteps the boundaries of academic propriety and perpetrates (or perpetuates?) only another sesquipedalian solicitation, the kind we have heard far too much of from such inferior monstrosities as Grand Funk Railroad and Ernst Krenek. Witness, per exemplum, her bitonal confection \\"Whisper Sex into Me\\" (track 19), in which the first subject confines itself to recapitulating a double-subdominant motif in A-flat, while the second subject consists of nothing more than our old friend the Alberti bass, endlessly reitereiterating its stultifying banalities in C-sharp minor. Doubtless we are intended to marvel at its audacious \\"incompetence\\" and then be brought up short by the sudden realization that we've been \\"had\\"...that Camilla has been toying with our deflated expectations all along! Yawn. Been there, done that (as my 12-year-old wife likes to say). As it is, this is merely a complemental album for the masses, who are willing to stew in their concupiscence. Those of us with more homologous tastes may prefer to wait it out.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I recently purchased this album and have yet to cease listening to it.  The entire CD can not be broken down into songs but more seems to be one experience.  To comment on the first review of this CD, the thirteenth step may also be Maynard's final step.  The entire album's lyrics deal with Maynard's addiction, specifically to heroin.  12 step programs are generally used to help people with their addictions.  The thirteenth step may be his way to rid himself of his own demons.  This album is nothing like the music out there now (thank God).  All of the Linkin Parks and Evanescences could never touch this. This is mastery.
6301954947|5.0|One of your reviewers mentioned a DVD version of this superb movie. So I checked at IMDB and found this DVD - by a good studio - at Amazon.co.uk. It's the original widescreen version. Running time 128' instead of 132' - but that may be due to the transfer. The snag: it's code 2. So how come you Americans let yourself be ruled by that  encoding racket? Where I live everybody sneers at it: coded DVD-players have no chance on the market. Not even the mugs will buy them. Either you get yourself a codefree DVD-Player (down to $ 70.- at the time at Basle, Switzerland - only a 110V-adapter needed to run it at your place), or a program to break that bl... encoding. How much interfering do you stomach?<BR>You could profit by all the DVDs classics offered on Amazon.co.uk and  Amazon.fr.<BR>Never mind - it's your very free choice (?) of your own. I'm glad market conditions have taken the choice out of my hands. No enforced encoding where I live - if they want to sell!<br />Here we won't stand for any of it!  And get the best of it.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|there are a couple of good songs on this album but there not as driving as the other 2 albums...especially AWAKE,probably there best.  The writing for this album seems to have slandered for this one.  But hopefully they will have some fresh new ideads and THE SAME DAMN DRUMMER for the next album.
B000002IWH|5.0|One of the best soundtracks ever!
B00005JMC6|5.0|I went to this fim because it is about Pacific Islanders and because Keisha Castle-Hughes is a dead-ringer in every way of my own daughter when she was that age (her amakua is the wild dolphin, however). But I always watch a movie with an ear open for the kauna- the hidden meaning. Whale Rider touches my heart because it acknowledges those who are adrift in the ocean of change....not able to return to the past and unable to live in the present without numbing the pain of separation from \\"something missing\\". In this movie, the protagonists are able to make the leap from a traditional form or ritual to one that evokes the underlying spirit in a new form- a form that fulfills the needs of the changing times. This leap is one we must all face sooner or later. Whale Rider demonstrates the power of forgiveness over pain...a valuable tool for every seeker.<br />10/30/03 Update. I have just received the DVD from amazon.com and it is a real treasure, produced with the same spirit that animates the film. The extra features are very interesting and so complementary to the movie that one can feel the power of true unity and collaboration that was created on every level by this production. In Hawaii, we call it \\"pono\\". Beautifully done, everyone!
0920668372|5.0|I always loved this book and read it to my sons when they were little.  Recently, this book took on a whole new meaning when my mother passed away.  I read this book at her eulogy to remind myself and everyone there about how she will still be my mother even though she is gone and how we should carry on traditions within our families to our children and then to our grandchildren, for our mothers live within usin every day of our lives.  Everyone loved the story, and many people wanted to purchase a copy after they heard it.
0812550706|5.0|Well to begin with,I was never a fan of sci-fi.I am a fantasy addict..So when a friend recommended this book I was a bit sceptical ..&quot;hmmm if this is another laser-battleship-slimy alien-srange planet book ...&quot; But it wasnt that kind of book.<BR>The elements of sci-fi are very well controlled and nothing is preposterously futuristic.The plot itself is great,the idea of military education and discipline on very young children,who know their fate is to save the world is masterfully expressed,and I like the psychological factor.Ender is not an one-dimensional character.He is not the hero stereotype.He CAN be afraid.In fact he is almost always afraid.He is not perfect.He has qualms,scruples.He is not holier-than-thou.Moreover,he IS a child..Not an adult character in a young body..I think I m gonna read more of Card's work..I recommend this book  to everyone not only sci-fi fans.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Gotta say it took a while for me to realise how beautiful this record is. When I bought the cd I had the highest expectations because of their fine debut Mer de Noms. I got kinda half-disapointed as alot of people according to the reviews. But it turned out the songs had such an imense depth that you can't grasp after the first time you hear them. After that it just got better and better. Even the cover, The Nurse Who Loved Me, seemed to contribute to something perfect. The fillers are in one way a disapointment because I was hoping for 12 songs from APC, but in the context they fulfill a purpose. <BR>Alot of people will probably disagree with this, but I found the first record uncomplete. The first part of the record has wonderful songs as The Hollow, Orestes and 3 Libras. But the second part just feels like halfmade songs. Don't get me wrong, it's still one of my favourite records, but The 13th Step is something far better. It's perfect!
B000028U0Y|5.0|I heard this album when I was a teenager, and it opened my eyes<BR>to the world of country music ballads.  This is the epicenter of<BR>the beginning of  modern country music popularity-thanks to The Man in Black, Johnny Cash.

If you want to augment your country classic col-<BR>lection, then this album is for you.  Performed live at Folsom<BR>Prison, it is done marvelously well, the background sounds of the prison audience provide gritty realism to the scene.<br />If you want a terrific guide to the late, lamented Johnny Cash,<BR>this is a great way to start.  Incidentally, this is one of the<BR>very first cross-over albums to hit it big with popular music<BR>fans.<br />This album has soul.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Sorry everyone who's into this music but call it whatever you want , It ain't rock not by a long shot so how everyone calls themn the world's best Rock Band is beyond me ,This CD is an absolute snoozefest , This music was doen 25 yrs ago and WAAYYYYY better by Pink Flyod , I mean 10000x better with more talent creativty and feel , RadioHead is a very Boring , Overatated and pretentious band that appeals only to Yuppie Music Critics and wannabe &quot;intellectual&quot; college kids , Now Guns N Roses , That was a REAL rock n roll band .
B00005MP58|5.0|After attempting to view other versions of Pride and Prejudice on film and then watching this version (Colin Firth)this is definitely the superior in every possible way.  Usually a movie is not even half as good the book it was meant to imitate but this (happily) was a rare exception.  The movie stayed true to form and did not deviate from the book.  WELL DONE!!!
B000001EAQ|1.0|As a hard-bitten fan of the band since &quot;Boy&quot; was a new release, veteran of nearly 20 U2 concerts dating back to the &quot;War&quot; tour, owner of over 60 U2 CD's (original releases, singles, remixes, alternate packaging of original releases), 80 vinyl records, all the released DVD's and VHS tapes, and over two-dozen cassettes and singles just for good measure...  I've purchased every single one of U2's albums/CD's from &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; onward on the very first day of their release, and only once did I feel like I wasted my morning racing to the local music merchant.  Guess when?<br />ACK!<br />This is the only U2 album I refuse to listen to ever again...  The only tour I've missed in 20 years...  The only time I think U2 ever had a serious misstep, and yes, that includes the much-maligned &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; phase (editorial note: as a pure concert film, primarily from the middle of the DVD onwards, &quot;R&amp;H&quot; has some of the most stirring concert footage ever committed to film, beating &quot;U2 Live in Boston&quot; and even &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;, the latter STILL not on DVD, by a fair margin).<br />This CD/album is an utter disaster, with only a handful of songs redeeming it from chuck-it-in-the-trash status.  &quot;Discotheque&quot; reminds me of nothing more than a sack full of displeased ferrets fighting for a scrap of food!<br />A general decline of form through the 90's that started with &quot;Zooropa&quot; achieved its' zenith with &quot;Pop&quot;, which is practically unlistenable to these ears.  Thankfully &quot;ATYCLB&quot; returned the band to a place of prominence, and begat a truly stirring string of live shows that are forever etched into my memory.  I travelled across the breadth of this land to see them live on the west coast (in addition to two shows on the right coast), yet wouldn't and didn't travel two dozen miles to see the &quot;Pop Mart&quot; tour out of purest contempt for what they'd perpetrated on the unsuspecting public in the form of their &quot;Pop&quot; CD.<br />If you really want to start a U2 collection, start anywhere, and I do mean ANYWHERE else.  Many regard &quot;October&quot; as U2's poorest effort, but really, it's a true masterpiece in comparison to this horrid collection of mind-numbing nonsensicle overproduction.  If only I could erase this travesty from my memory, I would be a much happier man.<br />But that's just MY opinion.  Inexplicably, this CD has achieved an average of four stars (!!!!).  I can only suspect mass psychosis on the part of professed U2 &quot;fans&quot;.   :)

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard James Keenan and the groups he does music with (A Perfect Circle, Tool) are on a different level than anyone else in the music industry. Created by creepy riffs, hard drumlines, and a melody unmatched, the members of these groups produce songs filled with rhythm and harmony that are sure to please their fans every time.<br />A Perfect Circle is the less harsh side of Tool. While their music is still filled with a somewhat dark and forboding feeling in many songs, they are quite a bit lighter and more ethereal sounding than their counterpart. Their first CD, &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;, was nothing but classic. Songs such as The Hollow, 3 Libras, and Judith are all listening bliss. As a whole though - the CD did have its weak points. It seemed to go into a slight slump while going through the second half of the CD and near the end. The hits made up for it though, and the disc was an overall great piece of work.<br />Thirteenth Step: The sequel to Mer De Noms which expands and builds upon its predecessor in every way. At first, it may seem like this album is not as solid (and more shallow) as Mer De Noms, but upon listening to the disc many, many times, I can say it's so much better as a whole. Sure, there are no songs that stick-out totally such as 3 Libras in the first one, but this CD flows together so smoothly in a soft-but-firm listening experience. It has a laid-back and thoughtful feeling throughout, and you can pop it in any time without worrying about skipping any song. Even the fillers, while they shouldn't have been taking up a full songs space, have point and meaning.<br />The standout tracks are The Package, Weak And Powerless, The Noose, Blue, The Outsider, Pet, and Gravity. And while there are no instant classic hits like &quot;3 Libras&quot; from Mer De Noms, the whole disc is an overall smoother, more flowing piece of work.<br />Overall Score: 92%
B00000IL67|5.0|Best known for his stage antics, few people actually know just how much music the former Vincent Furnier has actualy recorded. This boxed set certainly does not include every good song he ever recorded, but what is here is uniformly good, and not much more can really be expected from a boxed set. This set tries a somewhat even apprroach to his career, and it favors his stronger albums. The difficult thing for people compiling a boxed set is to have it flow and to try to get a lot of the best moments. The Life And Crimes Of Alice Cooper isn't perfect, but it is the single best way to learn about this should be hall of famer. Unfortunately Mascara And Monsters misses his more showy, unique recordings like Dead Babies, Ballad Of Dwight Fry And I love The Dead. The Best of does have Generation Landslide mysteriosly absent from here, but it jumps around far too much, making this a far better representation of his career and on of the few boxed sets that bests the single disc, making it nearly perfect.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Well I must say it is so similar to the first one it's alsmot like seein Rocky VII. You know what the ending is like and ya kinda already know whats gonna happen in the middle, but ya watch it anyway. I don't know if this one is quite worth the $17.65 at Wal-Mart maybe wait till it goes out of date a bit and pick it up for $10 bucks or so. It's not too bad though it grows on ya after a bit. It it 'true' linkin park 'style' though. Actually I give it a 4.5.
0792841344|5.0|Probably the best cult horror/sci-fi film ever made.  Combines a boogie man (Tall Man), corpses crushed down into hooded, very ugly dwarfs and, scariest of all, the fear of a 14 year old boy that he will be left alone in the world. A perfect combination of horror and science fiction, with one of the most memorable villains ever to grace the silver screen.  Says little, but is SCARY (BOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYYY!!).  <br />Rather than the typical damsel in distress, the protagonists (Mike, Reggie and Jamie) don't back down from the evil forces.  Instead, they arm themselves heavily and cruise around in a black muscle car looking to crack some skulls.  <br />If you are a film student, or just love film, the extras on this DVD are worth the purchase.  A truly amazing story of a 23 year old director (Don Coscarelli) who made a truly independent film, using money borrowed from neighbors and his parents.  The total budget was $ 300,000.  While the effects are sometimes corny, the overall mood created, and especially the haunting score, make it look like anything but a &quot;B&quot; horror film. The cast is riddled with relatives and friends lending a hand.<br />Phantasm 2 isn't bad, but 3 and 4 do a diservice to the original.<br />BUY THIS MOVIE.
0440178002|4.0|This book is--as my dear old Grandma would have said--a ripper.  In case you are one of the 9 people who haven't heard of it, it is a consistently-entertaining adventure/political intrigue story set in medieval Japan at the dawn of the Shogun era, just prior to the expulsion of Europeans from the Japanese home islands.  It is based on the true story of William Adams who, as near as I can find out (there appears to be precious little in English on the man) really did sail to &quot;The Japans&quot; in the early 17th century, and did indeed become a samurai.  But as others point out, it ain't history, and it isn't a language lesson, either.  It also purportedly contains anachronistic touches, such as the highly-stylized samurai code (which apparently wasn't codified until quite a bit later), and so on.<br />That aside, it's a pile of fun.  This isn't &quot;great literature&quot; by any stretch, but it's interesting and engrossing.  It's a bit too long, weighing in at something close to 900 pages, but if you are fascinated by the Japanese medieval culture, or by the political intrigue of the Elizabethan era, you'll enjoy this.  If digression from accepted history bothers you, or a somewhat-windy style of writing irritates you, give it a miss.  But speaking personally, this is the only Clavell novel that I've really been able to get into, and I've even re-read it a number of times.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|I agree with a reviewer who has complained about Josh Rouse being somewhat monotonous with previous efforts, but 1972 is such a fun album. It's just great pop.
B0000524E5|1.0|You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.<br />What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.<br />An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.<br />I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent.
B00003CXD5|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. I rarely see a movie more than twice, but with Humphrey Bogart I can watch it over and over. His role and acting in this movie is top notch and wonder why this never got its dues when first released.  The story line is great and all the supporting actors make this movie even stronger.  Unless you understand Spanish, some of the lines spoken by the Mexican actors will escape you which really puts this movie in its true character.  This is one movie you must see. I love it.....
B00003CXSM|2.0|This is one of those movies that you rent/watch for your significant other. I rented it for my wife since most of my movies as of recent have been mostly for me. However, I tried to keep an open mind and give it a fair shake. Unfortunately, this movie just sucked. First time director and first time screenwriters, what can you expect?<br />The script was just not believable. I know that romantic comedies have the liberty of taking some license here and there, but I just didn't buy so much of this movie that the whole thing just seemed fake. For starters, we're supposed to believe that Jennifer Lopez is an Italian immigrant? Come on! Her father (Alex Rocco (I)) doesn't sound Italian, he sounds retarded. I don't even know why she had to be an immigrant. There was nothing in the plot that required her being from another country, except for the fact that her father trys to arrange a marriage, which was just another unnecessary plot device. There's just so much that was wrong with this script, I'm just amazed that the leading actors signed on to this project.<br />The talent in this movie was fairly decent. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey had some chemistry and they looked good together. Kathy Najimy is a wonderful comedic actress and her scene with Jennifer was very good and believable. Fred Willard, and Kevin Pollak are the other actors that do comedic roles extremely well, but their talents were simply not tapped. They did what they could, but they simply had nothing to work with. IMHO I think Jennifer Lopez signed on because she was friends with Adam Shankman (he's a choreographer) and once she signed on, everyone else jumped on board for their resume.
B000002UAU|5.0|There's not much to be said about this album; everyone knows how great it is.  If it weren't for Sgt. Pepper, progressive rock would never have existed.  <br />Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds: Anthony Nasti, who also wrote a review for this album, says that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is not about acid.  That's pretty much like saying Bob Marley didn't smoke grass.  The Beatles were mystic experimentalists, and some of their experiments involved LSD.  It's just a fact.  Have you ever heard &quot;The Magical Mystery Tour?&quot;  Have you listened to the lyrics of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?&quot;  How about George's People also claim that Pink Floyd didn't &quot;do drugs.&quot;  Yes, they did.  <br />Anyway, what I'm saying is that it's possible to like a band even if you disapprove of their chemical activities.  Frankly, I don't trust any band that didn't do drugs at some point.
B00003CWTI|4.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart. I made the mistake of starting this movie at 10:30pm thinking that it'd be the usual 1.5 hour movie. I should have looked at the sleeve more closely, this movie is over 3 hours long. Not to mention the fact that Anderson pushes the boundaries of storytelling by interweaving a multitude of characters to tell one story, or message. This is a &quot;thinking man's&quot; movie and not something to just flip through like so many movies released today.<br />The script is great, but Anderson has also put together a fantastic cast to bring it to life. John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Philip Baker Hall are some of the best character actors around and they just light up the screen. Tom Cruise who gives a stand out performance as Frank T.J. Mackey (host of an infomercial called &quot;Seduce and Destroy&quot;), Julianne Moore, William H. Macy round out the cast and bring a little star power along with them. But there are a ton of more actors in this ensemble piece, such as Jason Robards, but the list is simply too long to list.<br />It's so hard to review this film, simply because it is told in such a unique way. All of the characters are connected to one another in some way shape and form and Anderson uses a variety of styles to tell the story. In fact, at one point, it's almost a music video as all of the major characters lip sync to one of the cuts from the soundtrack. This movie is funny, sad, poignant, and absurd. It's simply one of those films that you'll be talking about days after seeing it, still trying to put all the pieces together. Overall, this film is a movie lover's feast. A feast full of rich a delectable tastes. Dig in.
B000001FQ8|4.0|I don't see why people in here have to bring up g.w when he was not even president when this album was recorded.  Having said that I think John mellencamp and Steve Earle are two of the best songwriters out there and I'm a republican.  I really love this and the previous album &quot;lonesome Jubilee&quot;  for some reason this album never really stuck with me at the time It came out.  But after listening to the samples I can see what I have been missing out on all these years.
068484267X|5.0|This would be a very sad story except for the way it is written, through the eyes of a child.  He makes you laugh out loud many times.  I did not see the movie because I thought it would be very depressing not seeing it through the eyes of the boy.  <BR>However, I was very disappointed with his book, &quot;Tis&quot;.  I suppose it is a good book but I wanted his wonderful humor again and it was not present at all in &quot;Tis&quot; where he is now an adult.
B000025XKM|5.0|I will admit up front that I discovered Nick Drake's music by seeing the Volkswagen Jetta commercial with the title track \\"Pink Moon\\" in it (*cough*).  I would have preferred to find out about Nick Drake's music in a less commercial, indirect way, but oh well.  I'll be perfectly honest and admit that the commercial actually embodies the mood of the music quite accurately.  (Congratulations, Volkswagen...I might go out and buy a Jetta now--well, if I was rich anyway.)  As a matter of fact, that commercial is one of the few car commercials I can actually watch all the way through without wanting to vomit uncontrollably on my television screen.  Chevy's \\"Like a rock!\\" or Ford's \\"Have you driven a ford lately?\\" ad campaigns with shots of trucks getting muddy'd up in commercial-friendly shiny rough terrain in mountainous landscapes in the middle of nowhere, USA just isn't cutting it for me.  No, I'm not a real man.  I don't even shop at Menard's.<br />ANYWAY....back to the music.  Let me answer that hypothetical question that I, along with many other people, hate to answer.<br />\\"If you were stranded on an island and you could only have one record with you, what would it be?\\"  <br />First off, lets face it... The odds of getting stranded on an island is really unlikely considering that the majority of us dont frequent islands on a regular basis and getting stranded on an island isn't high on the list of \\"things that we are afraid of...\\" But, IF it were to ever happen, you'd want to be prepared in advance and have your copy of Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" readily available at all times.  Forget about dispensable items such as food and water, you'll die happy having this album along.
0385504209|5.0|A quick summer read, a suspense-filled thriller, an educational tool and a mind-bending experience. The DA VINCI CODE has it all. The only problem with this book is that eventually it ends, and you're left having to research some of the more fascinating topics you've read on your own, rather than having them laid-out before you using Brown's masterful words. Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez
6304233639|5.0|One of the best movies of 1996 delivers one of the best science fiction movies since Star Trek. The movie's story starts out as mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all-out invasion of the human race.  The movie begins when several radio areas across the world recieve a transmission from the moon that sounds just like bees buzzing themselves out. Then at the Pentagon, they recieve pictures of the largest spaceships that are wider than the Enterprise of Star Trek. Even worse, they disrupt TV reception and satellites, too. The spaceships are 15 miles in width, enough to encompass an entire city. David, a computer whiz from New York finds an alien program hidden in the satellites, and precisely six hours from now, the alien ships will attack every major city all over the planet. That includes Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C.  Then, at approximately six hours later, the aliens fire their destructive weapons at the major cities all over the planet, causing big fires ten times than in actual fires and people dying in the process. Three of the funniest lines are: \\"We want you dead!\\", \\"Oh No, you didn't shoot that green crap at me\\", and \\"All right you alien animals... in the words of my generation, up yours!\\" are especially amusing.
B00000G3I2|4.0|Aaaa...what a great movie.  There are two main ways to view The Big Chill....<BR>1. as a mindless, pointless showing of 7 drug-using former hippies from the University of Michigan(plus the clueless girlfriend of their suicidal friend) hatched up in a Southern plantation house for a few days, remembering their dead friend Alex after they reunite from various areas for his funeral.<BR>2.  As a fun, surprisingly-realistic look at REAL friendship and how, if you dont keep it up, it can drift slowly away.  At how love and friendship are the most important things in life, and may be the key to happiness.  At how true friendship never really disappears, and how it can be triggered once again, after a few days of getting high and singing and dancing to oldies with college friends. :)  <BR>I sure hope 6 of my best friends and I can someday hang out in a plantation house together for a weekend.<BR>The soundtrack to this movie is GREAT and is ALL oldies, including Marvin Gaye, Three Dog Night and The Temptations.  A Fun, worthwhile movie with some funny one-liners.
079073804X|5.0|The most powerful words to describe this type of movie is, \\" the good  can triumph over evil\\". Over the 1800's, God won the battle in the   good vs.evil war with Satan himself.In which that means, always take  God's side.  Throughout most of the movie, it's not just the posession that can  use a human soul to conquer,even the phenomena of it. I had a phenomena  experience at the Buxton Inn as well.A little boy's hand prints are on my  hands.  That's what the movie is telling you. Your posession is in the palm  of your hands,and it's up to you to a rid of it once and for all.  It just does'nt take 2 priests to help you, it's what the devil has  to do to get out of your soul.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is indeed a new style for the Chili Peppers. They've changed into more pop-rock kind of sound, which doesnt make them any worse, though, cause they really seem to know how to play good poprock. And in this album, despite of the more &quot;chill&quot; sound, they're still rocking out, unlike in their new creation By the way, which just sounds boring and old. <br />I was surprised to read almost all the reviews, and finding that no-one had said anything about the superb track, &quot;This velvet glove&quot;. I personally think this is maybe the best track of the whole album (along with &quot;Savior&quot;, &quot;Easily&quot; and &quot;Californication&quot;) The song isn't trying to prove anything, yet it doesn't lack anything. This is basically what the whole album is about. It has nothing spectacular in it (like BSSM and Mother's milk did) but what it has, it sounds perfect. <br />I'd say changes for better.
B00000AFHM|5.0|It's now five years since this album was released and so we now have considerable hindsight on our side to give this album a more well-rounded look.  Since it was released, Belle and Sebastian became, thanks in part to a memorable scene in the movie High Fidelity, the band of choice to savage for showing any kind of vulnerability or sensitivity in the sound, both musically and lyrically.  And so they unfairly became the band most likely to provide the soundtrack for depressed teenagers to write poetry in their bedrooms to, which does a disservice to such imaginative music.  It's very telling that most of the negative reviews for this album on this site tend to attack the band's listeners as much as the band itself.  Yes, there is a gentleness here that's not for everyone.  But The Boy With the Arab Strap definitely falls into the category of &quot;timeless masterpieces,&quot; due primarily to its fascinating arrangements and overall quality.<br />Words like &quot;twee&quot; and &quot;fey&quot; and &quot;precious&quot; are tossed around by those out for blood, but anyone who takes the time to listen will hear a wealth of interesting instrumentation, great melodies, and probably the most diversity ever displayed on one of their albums.  For that reason I'd easily crown it the band's best (and I have heard the newest one, Dear Catastophe Waitress).  <br />Highlights for me are The Rollercoaster Ride for its quiet catchiness and hypnotic piano part which comes in halfway and never lets up; the title track for its unfailing ability to get the toe tapping; Chickfactor for its beautiful rolling keyboard and aching strings; Sleep the Clock Around with its great use of bagpipe, and Dirty Dream Number Two for rivalling Spector in its huge wall of sound.<br />Best of all, it endures, and I suspect it will never sound dated and will make Top 100 Albums lists for years to come.  Pretty rare.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book. I also have, &quot;Lucky&quot; by Alice Sebold which was a good book, but hard to read due to the subject matter.<br />The Lovely Bones is my new favorite book.<br />I loved the writing, the story, and the way Alice made heaven. It wasn't too far-fetched for my tastes. I will admit that there was one thing out of the whole book that I wasn't sure needed to be in there (but perhaps it did) and was pretty far-fetched. Other then that...<br />I had trouble putting the book down and read it very quickly. I was sad when I finished it... I hated to turn the last page; I wanted more!<br />The character developement was wonderful, the story was amazing and why couldn't things happen this way?<br />Wonderful book, you won't regret buying it.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Much like many people on here, I was incredibly disappointed by the new album. The cover artwork is absolutely, undeniably the most godawful thing I've seen in forever (folks might have been impressed with horrendous computer art in 1991?), the songs aren't as catchy as they are on BNW, and the production is weak. I'll leave the cover alone since anyone who's got a smidgen of brains shudders at the sight of it.<br />The album has grown on me the more I listened, though I'm definitely grooving more on the overall feel as opposed to specific songs, which tends to contradict almost every other Maiden album I enjoy (ie, everything except No Prayer For The Dying and any of the Blayze albums). The first song is nothing special, but isn't bad. The second track is definitely one of my favorites, with an excellent chorus and some great guitar parts. The fourth would be great if I didn't keep wincing every time the chorus and guitar start doing the same thing (haven't winced that hard since the prechorus to Die With Your Boots On). There are definitely way too many tracks that have the slow building start. I don't mind how Maiden has decided to make their songs longer, but the problem is, if the song isn't that mind-blowing, its fairly annoying to have to sit through 8 minutes of it. I enjoyed how long the tracks on BNW were, but almost everything on this album could afford to be shaved down quite a bit, especially considering there is a great lack of catchy choruses. <br />The drums are much quieter in the mix this time, and the bass is much mellower, allowing the three guitars to stand out more. Unfortunately, much like BNW, they aren't really doing that much with them. Where are all the harmonies and parts playing off of each other? If there was any band I'd like to have three guitarrists, its Maiden, but for goodness' sake, use them!<br />The only reason I'm giving this guy three stars is because those few amazing numbers (2, 9, 10) are really quite good.<br />I find thisis an album I like to put on and ignore. Which certainly has its place, but up until this point putting on a Maiden album has been in order to sing along and rock out and get energized. I still think this is the aim of the band, but if it is, it certainly failed.
B000000W9Z|5.0|This is one evil mother of a jazz/lounge/industrial/rock/ambient/darkwave album. It's got great hooks, dark corners, hip-shaking house-raisers and some of Bowie's best lyrics(\\"Stay away from the future/Don't tell God your plans/It's all deranged/No control.\\") Eno's stark soundscapes, Garson's elegant and hypnotic piano and keyboard work, Garbrel's guitar witchery and Bowie's paranoid \\"conceptualism\\"(not to mention David's knack for putting together great studio bands) make for a delightfully nocturnal, surreal and \\"underwordly\\" painting. \\"The Motel\\" is one the most unsettling and fragile tracks ever crooned by Bowie: gloriously tragic and dramatic...a swinging heartbreak. \\"A Small Plot Of Land\\" is a rattling, shuffling, skittering, soaring creature of a jazz track...it's a like a nightmare running thru the night. Bowie still loves to put the funk down and he does it in spades with \\"I Have Not Been To Oxford Town\\". \\"We Prick You\\" patters about creepily like a mesquito. \\"Wishful Beginings\\" is just as creepy. The little spoken-word interludes I could do without, but every actual song this album is perfectly perfect. It's so interesting to see David melding progressive jazz with glitch and rock. It makes for a pleasureably brooding listen.
B00008VGK0|3.0|This past year has been one filled with much controversy for Madonna. Not her first year to bring so much controversy, 2003 saw Madonna heavily influenced by personal problems and the war in Iraq. April saw the release of Madonna's latest studio album, \\"American Life,\\" which topped the charts in both the US and UK and has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide to date. The first song from the album was the self-titled American Life. The song flopped big style in the US, due to lack of airplay as many stations refused to play the song due to Madonna's comments on President Bush and his regime. The song peaked at No.2 in the UK singles charts, but did not spend more than one week in the Top 10.<br /><br />American Life begins with Madonna singing, \\"Do I have to change my name? Will it get me far? Should I lose some weight? Am I gonna be a star?\\" before a hi-tech and computerised beat takes over and Madonna sings the first verse, \\"I tried to be a boy. I tried to be a girl. I tried to be a mess, I tried to be the best. I guess I did it wrong. That's why I wrote this song. This type of modern life. Is it for me? This type of modern life. Is it for free? So I went into a bar. Looking for sympathy. A little company. I tried to find a friend. It's more easily said it's always been the same. This type of modern life is not for me. This type of modern life is not for free.\\" For Madonna, it's an incredibly long verse. Her verse are usually rather short and snappy, but it's obvious from the first few lines that Madonna has a lot to say and is in a very political state of mind. She then sings the guitar-influenced chorus, \\"American life. I live the American dream. You are the best thing I've seen. You are not just a dream.\\" The hi-tech beat then packs more punches as Madonna sings the second verse, \\"I tried to stay ahead. I tried to stay on top. I tried to play the part, but somehow I forgot. Just what I did it for, and why I wanted more. This type of modern life. Is it for me? This type of modern life. Is it for free?\\" Madonna then sings the first few notes that she sang at the beginning of the song, before going on to sing the chorus once more. The beat rises and falls and the song gets all weird...<br /><br />Madonna then tries her experimental hand at rapping with the rap, \\"I'm drinking a Soy latte, I get a double shot. It goes right through my body and you know I'm satisfied. I drive my mini cooper and I'm feeling super-dooper. Yo they tell I'm a trooper and you know I'm satisfied. I do yoga and pilates and the room is full of hotties. So I'm checking out the bodies and you know I'm satisfied. I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysic's s**t is dope and if all this can give me hope you know I'm satisfied. I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef. Three nannies, an assistant and a driver and a jet. A trainer and a butler and a bodyguard or five. A gardener and a stylist. Do you think I'm satisfied? I'd like to express my extreme point of view. I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew. I'm just living out the American dream. And I just realised that nothing is what it seems.\\" I hated this rap at first, but I have grown quite fond of it because of the lyrics and the message it has behind them. Madonna then sings the chorus a few more times as the song crashes and dies down.<br /><br />The video to American Life cause tons of controversy back in the spring of 2003. Madonna originally shot an elaborate video to the song involving a catwalk and war victims to connect the link of war and fashion. By the time the video was due to be shown, however, the war in Iraq had already begun and Madonna - for the first time in her career - back down out of doing something out of respect. Obviously, Madonna then had her critics calling her a coward for pulling out. She wasn't - she was bowing out in respect. A much cheaper video was shot with world flags in the background. The controversy over American Life hasn't done much for Madonna's reputation of career in 2003, and we can only hope that Madonna comes back bigger, better and strong next year. Overall, a good song, but definitely not her best.and we can only hope that Madonna comes back bigger, better and strong next year. Overall, a good song, but definitely not her best.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|first off, no one should ever compare a perfect circle to tool. as maynard has said this band reflects his femanin side, as tool represents the masculin.  the thirteenth step is an excellent album. its sound is harder than a mer de noms, but just as emotional. <BR>one shouldnt judge the sound of the cd listening to &quot;weak and powerless&quot;, and in my opinion its not even the best song. to fully appreciate this cd, i agree, that it must be heard all the way through a few times. forget skipping through because you won't get the whole feel of it and surely miss parts that bring each song together. <BR>i will say that this cd comes off a little short, but is well worth it for any maynard fan...

B00000AFGM|5.0|First Manson song I ever heard & saw was TheDopeShow and I was like \\"what a F**K is this? Really relly strange song and image, but it was rock`n`roll on MTV at 17.00 p.m.??! After that I went to buy that album, what I discovered was something I could`t believe, there was a new rock band that really blows my mind to somewhere in space and further than ever before. I thougt the age of great rock bands was over and all that there was going to be is that mediocore crap/\\"happy-punk\\"/limbsbiskit and blaablaa music without any deeper meaning to it... (I love bands like; TheDoors,Jimi Hendrix, Queen, Pink Floyd, Danzig, Bob Marley) ..and when I heard Marilyn Manson`s Mechanical Animals I was stunned and emotionally shaken. There`s such intelligence to lyrics too and visual things and all kind of strange sounds and messages. And I think the band is very talented musically & artistically too. Some people will never discover the strange-beaty of this album,<BR>but that`s the way it has always been in the cases of real art, big masses accept and understand it much more later. I`m not a teenager anymore, but I keep my mind&heart open to new things... Oh sorry, I was talking about the band before that little emotional outburst...  so..<BR>Maybe they`re not so awesome players technically but they really are soundwise and \\"melodically\\" gifted. To me it will always be an important album, it`s such a experience. Mechanical Animals is that midle part of manson`s holy trilogy, starting with HOLY WOOD and ending with ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR. M.A. is my favorite, maybe because it`s my first Manson album, or  maybe because that almost everytime I listen to it it still moves me somehow. But ofcourse it`s not for everyone and that`s normal, we are all unique with a different tastes, but I love it.
B000059XUP|1.0|This half hearted sequel attempt to the brilliantly moody The Crow is so devoid of any emotion or soul that it still makes me cringe to this day when I watch it just like I did back when it first came out.  Vincent Perez plays Ashe; a man resurrected and guided by a crow to avenge his death and the death of his young son.  Perez broods his way throughout the film, his wooden acting skills don't let us mourn for him much, same with Mia Kirshner's character Sara (the little girl from the first film now all grown up) and the villians seem like typical card board comic cut outs of typical drug addicted low lifes.  In the end, The Crow: City of Angels is a terrible, derivative sequel to the modern day classic original, and would be followed by a direct to video sequel which was a bit better; The Crow: Salvation.  The rest of the cast includes Richard Brooks, punk icon Iggy Pop, ex-Power Ranger Thuy Trang, and Thomas Jane who is due to play The Punisher in the upcoming film.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Three Dollar Bill has to be the most overrated record of all time. \\"Faith\\" is actually worse than the original version (now THAT ain't easy, faithful readers.) Why LimpBizkit fans like a poorly recorded record with generic rap rock riffs is beyond me, but Rage Against the Machine didn't exactly run for cover when the early Bizkit stuff came out (but I did...)<BR>No,unfortuantely for those of you trapped in the suburbs, \\"Chocolate\\" features some very nifty and intricate guitar work (NOWHERE to be found on record number one) and the drumming of Otto shifts and pulsates on a dime. Yeah, maybe Fred Durst isn't the greatest vocalist, but compared to his contemporaries (Johnathan Davis can't hold a tune, etc) he at least enunciates. When the smoke clears on this decade of Nu Metal, sadly, the \\"I hate myself an wanna die\\" music will make adolescents say \\"what were WE thinking when we listened to this?\\" and people will see why true visionaries like Method Man and Redman wanted to get down with Bizkit. At least they took chances and had solid muscianship instead of making drop d music that only a pre pube male would love. Hey guys- wanna get a date? Play Limp Bizkit, NOT Korn, and trust me- you'll score. Hey Fred- my red cap is off to YOU.
0486409511|5.0|After studying calligraphy through workshops and lessons since 1989, I decided to add Copperplate to my repertoire. I found learning this style requires a whole new &quot;think&quot; on writing:  different flexible pen nibs, pen angles, paper slant, stops, bold and hairline strokes, and of course incredible(albeit refined)embellishment. This book holds prime position in my library, is ink-stained and spotted, has pages unbound from overuse, and is the most perfect way to learn this hand as any I have ever seen.  Every time I want to use Copperplate on a commission or project, I haul it out to have beside me, to remember all the little specifics that make Copperplate so beautiful.  I love this book!

B00006IU73|5.0|i really don't remember when did i heard such a intrigue and beautifull album.Porcupine Tree mixes Hard-rock,Ambient,progressive rock and avantgarde in their own style.they are true genius on a map of modern rock.<BR>the opening track &quot;Blackest eyes&quot; is the best example of their skills and abbilities - main riff is really heavy and the verses are soft,almost pop styled...<BR>the standouts here are impossibly catchy &quot;Trains&quot; and &quot;Blackest eyes&quot; and hypnotic piano-based ballads &quot;Collapse light into earth&quot;,&quot;heartattack in layby&quot; and &quot;Lips of ashes&quot;.Steven Wilson's voice is soft and pleasent but can be also more agressive - depends on what he sings.his guitar works are also great,something between David Gilour (Pink floyd) and Eric Clapton but played with modern rock/metal taste.<BR>Many of people are thinking that it is Metal because of the album cover.Although there can be found many metal tastes the whole album is suited in more Progressive/ambient rock style (the use of synths,samples and keys).really,it grows on you after each listening.more than 60 minutes of pure emotional music...
031286504X|4.0|The story I Am Legend is a very well-written vampire story with a nice twist.  It's not the usual vampire hunter type book, but ends up making you look at things from two different points of view.  It's amazing that the author can keep the reader interested and captivated in the story of one single man.  As an avid reader of Anne Rice, Stephen King, and Dean Koontz, I was apprehensive at first about this novel, but ended up being very satisfied.  The other stories in the book are hit or miss, some better than others.  He does have an interesting writing style and interesting ideas.  Some of his short stories were a little on the windy side, but all in all he's a rare mind.  Definitely worth picking up and reading the whole thing though, especially I Am Legend.

B0000BYM3K|4.0|I don't care about those who think Iron Maiden has run out of gas, as far as I'm concerned they are still on a full tank. The new album, Dance of Death, just emphasizes it. Bruce Dickinson still sounds amazing and some songs on the CD such as &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;No More Lies&quot; show that he can go mellow if need be. &quot;Paschendale&quot; is, hands down, the best song on the album, an 8 minute epic. &quot;New Frontier,&quot; Nicko McBrain's writing debut is also excellent. There is not one bad track on this album. Is it as good as, say, Piece of Mind? No. It does not compare to the classic albums of the 80's, but it is still worth buying. 4 stars, UP THE IRONS!!!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I used to think that Disney put out truly great animation that touches the souls of those who watch it, that is until I watched this film.  Disney has done at least one good thing in the last few years, which is to bring Mononoke and other Miyazaki movies to America.  I applaud them for it, even if they don't always appreciate the masterpieces that they are selling.<br />Princess Mononoke is an anime movie, but in many ways it is beyond anime.  Although it is steeped in Japanese history and mythology, this is a film that has meaning for  people of every culture, dealing with universal themes such as ecological preservation and the often self-destructive ways  of human nature.  It even comments on the relationship between men and women.  All are subjects that American movies have tried to contemplate before but not with nearly as much intelligence or respect for the audience.  There are no real villians here, creeping around with their evil intentions; not once does the audience feel that they are being preached to about Right and Wrong.  Mikyazaki simply presents characters who are doing the best they can in a bad situation, as all people do in real life.  Granted, in real life, raging Forest Gods aren't trying to kill you.  But suspension of disbelief is easy to acheive when you have a meaningful story line and characters that people can actually care about.  <br />The animation is simple compared to Spirited Away, but is just as beautiful and fits well with the starker atmosphere of the movie.  A lot of it reminds me of old Japanese paintings.  I'm glad to say that there was a minimum of computer animation used in this film and the whole movie has a rich hand drawn feel.  The score by Joe Hisaishi is simply grand (I'll plug the soundtrack while I'm at it); since I've seen this movie I'm not only a Miyazaki fan, but also a devoted Hisaishi listener. <br />It's a shame, then, that such a perfect movie would be given such a mediocre dubbing job.  Disney did just whatI expected they would do. . . they chose actors based on their names and not on how  well they portrayed the characters.  It's pretty obvious that those in charge had publicity in mind when they cast Billy Bob Thornton, of all people, as a Japanese monk.  Claire Danes is too whiny and childish to play the dour San, and Billy Crudup is just dull in the lead role of Ashitaka.  I will give credit to Minnie Driver, however, the only one among them who did as good a job as her Japanese counterpart.  Driver is a dead ringer for the sophisticated and strong-willed Eboshi.<br />Regardless, I suggest this movie not only to anime fans but to anyone who likes a good story and strong characters who don't adhere to Hollywood conventions.  Take the time to read the subtitles.  I should warn that there is some gore and violence, but it is used tastefully and in regards to the plot.
B00008J2PG|4.0|Great Job ... Acting, Location & Story.  Its nice to see one more positive telling of the Church during the war.  Not too many people know that the Chief Rabi of Rome during and immediately after the war, Israel Zolii, was so impressed by the Christians in Rome who tried to protect Jews from nazi persecution, that he was baptised as Catholic shortly after the end of the war.  He took for his Christian name Eugene ... the same first name as Pope Pius XII, whom he especially admired as a friend and protector of Jews. He died as a devout Catholic.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Okay, I was going to write about this CD the day I bought it, but I'm glad I didn't because my opinion has improved greatly!  First thing:  It's not Heathen.  At first, that was bad for me.  I loved about half the songs on Heathen...great vampy epic pieces like &quot;Slip Away&quot; and &quot;Sunday.&quot;  Of course Heathen was bogged down by ChEazy-Listening songs like &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; and &quot;A Better Future.&quot;  <br />If none of the songs on Reality are of the same genre as the better tracks on Heathen, at least they're more consistantly good, and more upbeat and rocky.  These are great songs.  I am confused by Bowie's sometimes cheesey production, like the use of backing vocals that are the equivalent of a sit-com laugh track on otherwise great songs like &quot;Never Get Old.&quot;  I wish he'd let them be more &quot;real,&quot; and less produced, to let the songs shine by themselves.  But I'm being picky.  It's another great album by a great musician.<br />Highlights are &quot;Never Get Old,&quot; &quot;Reality,&quot; &quot;New Killer Star,&quot; and the haunting, gorgeous, epic ballad &quot;Bring Me the Disco King.&quot;  (Am I weird for thinking Joni Mitchell should cover this?  It's jazzy, introspective, lyrical, and her voice sounds a lot like Bowie's these days.  Joni, if you're reading this....)
0385504209|1.0|I was prepared to like this book because it was recommended by family and friends.  It grabbed my attention immediately and was very exciting.  The more I read, however, the more I didn't like what was written.  As a Catholic, I just kept saying &quot;That can't be true!&quot;  The claims of this being a well-researched book just struck me as wrong.  I would recommend reading an article called &quot;Dismantling The Da Vinci Code&quot; by Sandra Miesel.  It takes Mr. Brown's &quot;facts&quot; that sound so reasonable and documents why they aren't true.  I love reading good fiction but I don't like it when fiction is presented as fact.
0694013889|1.0|My daughter received this book on her 2nd birthday from a friend who has 2 children she has potty trained so my husband and I were hopeful that we would have the same success with this book.  NO SUCH LUCK.  1st of all, the \\"wee wee\\" \\"poo poo\\" terminology seems a bit odd to us.  2nd of all, the potty looks like a flower pot or pitcher of some sort, not anything like the baby bjorn potty we bought.  In fact, while reading the book to our child for the 1st time we got to the picture of the \\"poo poo\\" in the bowl, she got all excited and yelled \\"ice cream mommy\\". Lastly, the explanation of the genitals is way overboard for a child this age.  We got the baby doll that wets, hopefully it'll give us better results.
1573921394|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst treatise on Economics ever written. Not only is it completely wrong and backwards, but -- worse yet -- it has gained a great deal of influence, causing wrong and backwards policies. The influence that Keynes and this book have garnished is largely responsible for the exacerbation of the business cycle through never-ending tweaking of the economy by the government.<br />The complete and utter failure of Keynesian tweaking with the free market economy to prevent the business cycle should prove that Keynes General Theory is absolutely worthless as a theory of economics. So, too, should 1970's epidemic of the Inflationary Recession -- something which, according to Keynesian economic thought, should be flat-out impossible. There you have it, the facts of history have shown that Keyne's economic theory is as bogus as the idea that the Sun revolves around the Earth.<br />I'd advise you to read a book on economics that is actually correct in it's analysis. If you want to actually learn something valid about economics, I'd suggest you turn to someone other than this false-prophet. Mises, Hayek, and Rothbard all have insightful and valid things to say about economics. As for Keynes and his \\"General Theory\\", I can assure you, you will be a less intelligent person for having read it.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Erykah Badu's WORLDWIDE UNDERGROUND is a slice of musical Heaven.  Let me begin by first saying that I find Badu to be incredibly inspiring and an amazing artist.  Every time I listen to her work it makes me want to pick up my pen and start writing...anything! something!  I think any review of this CD should begin by saying that &quot;Danger&quot; is a fascinating concoction, an elixir of mesmerizing musicianship and great storytelling.  It is brilliant and one of the best songs released this year.  &quot;Love of My Life Worldwide&quot; is also amazing.  What a treat it is to hear Badu, the great and incomparable Queen Latifah, the stirring Angie Stone and Bahamadia putting down a most proper and groovin' jam! The song with Roy Hargrove is nicely rendered as well. I appreciate and love Erykah Badu.  She is an artist in every sense of the word and I am glad to have been invited to the party and consciousness she calls the Worldwide Underground!!  I am in awe.
B0000AXM3N|3.0|A Perfect Circle is  a great band, there is no doubt, but I was dissapointed with this album. It isn't bad it just has just as many bad songs as it does good.  It is alot different then the previous album which is good for growth, but I just didn't feel the way they grew. GIve the Album a listen though because there are some really good tracks on here but don't be expecting  a groundbreaker.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is an excellent collection of songs from an outstanding band.  It's rare that a band's sophomore album improves upon its initial offering, and Thirteenth Step certainly accomplishes that.  The album starts gently with 'the package', but quickly builds in intensity after its second verse.  The remaining songs interweeve Maynard's sickeningly sweet melodies with classic rock guitar riffs in a way that is refreshingly unique.  All young rock bands should aspire to produce work half as good as Thirteenth Step....sadly, few of them ever will.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|First off, i am a 14 year old who has been playing guitar for hte past 3 months and lsitening to hendrix for around yes u guessed it: 3 months<br />the man is simply amazing, not just his technical ability his energy soul and versatility and obviously his virtuosity.<br />I have read all that i can about Hendrix and heard just about all of his published work and many of his live preformances, and i have to say this is a mighty collection, although i would have liked to see &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot; (and i ecnourage every hendrix fan to listen to his live version of it at the Isle of Wight, its great.)  Also i would have liked to see &quot;Gypsy Eyes&quot; here (from First Rays of hte New Rising Sun), but thats cuz i like funk and its a rather funky tune.<br />This CD satisfies those who enjoy hendrix as a rock icon but also those who love his lyrics and soul like me, but of course his early songs are always fun to listen to, especially Voodoo Child (Slight Return) i have yet to hear a song similar to it.<br />My personal favorite is &quot;All Along hte Watchtower&quot;, &quot;Room Full of Mirrors&quot;, or &quot;Foxey Lady&quot;<BR>BUY THIS NOW OR YOUR LIFE WILL BE INCOMPLETE!!
B00008EY9G|4.0|Just when you are about to lose hope for the future of the film industry, someone comes out with a smart movie for adults that despite playing into the slasher genre does so with unusual aplomb.<br />With nods to Hitchock's &quot;Psycho&quot; and Agatha Christie's &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; &quot;Identity&quot; gives us a creepy desert motel soon populated by a host of folks stranded by an unrelenting rain storm that has washed out the roads. A car accident brings in Ed (John Cusack - a burned out ex-cop), now chauffeuring an insufferable C-movie actress from shoot to shoot (an unrecognizable Rebecca DeMornay), and a family of three for first aid. Unable to use the phones to call for assistance, Ed is forced to drive to the local hospital. Along the way, he picks up Paris (Amanda Peet - doing an updated version of Janet Leigh's character in &quot;Psycho&quot;, but without the shower scene), and a very newly married couple, all three stranded at the eastern end of the washed out highway. With no options, they head back to the motel.<br />The back story of the film follows an inquest into the mental state of a psychotic serial killer who had murdered six people years before. A psychiatrist has proof that the insanity plea was mishandled, so the execution - set for tomorrow - must be rethought. As the legal teams wait for the killer, they lose contact with his car and driver.<br />Sure enough, the motel picks up their last two occupants for the night: cop number two, Rhodes (Ray Liotta), and his prisoner (Jake Busey). The stage is now set for murder most foul.<br />What makes &quot;Identity&quot; a cleverer-than-most flick is the deft handling of the death-dealing that proceeds sequentially according to room number. When it becomes apparent that the deaths are proceeding numerically even though some appear to have no means by which they could have occurred in that manner, the spooky factor goes up a notch. Could it be that the tormented spirits of long-dead tribe members - yes, the motel was built on an Indian burial ground - are exacting revenge? And what does it mean that everyone at the motel has the same birthday?<br />&quot;Identity&quot; answers these questions with one of the better twist endings you'll see. And for those not satisfied with one mind-bending twist, the filmmakers give you a second one for your money. But sadly, this is where the film goes from the unusual to the cliched, as the second twist is a tried and true slasher gimmick that ultimately costs the film a ratings star.<br />With a firm R-rating for plenty of vulgarity and a host of gruesome murders, &quot;Identity&quot; is certainly not a film for anyone but adults. But the director, James Mangold, deserves some credit for leaving out the anatomical details of the killing process itself, unlike other films in this genre. In truth, no one needs to see just how that baseball bat wound up where it did.<br />The DVD itself is nothing special, though it does give widescreen and full-screen options, plus your choice of the theatrical release or a very slightly modified extended edition. There's filmographies for the actors, deleted scenes, director's commentary, and a very nicely done set of navigation screens. In all, though, fairly typical of what you'll find on most DVD's today.<br />With fine casting, smart writing, solid acting, plenty of twists, and a supernatural element, &quot;Identity&quot; is far from your run-of-the-mill crazed serial killer flick, making it a worthy addition to the collection of slasher, horror, thriller, and mystery film buffs alike.tribe members - yes, the motel was built on an Indian burial ground - are exacting revenge?

B000001DTM|5.0|This is a terrific album from U2, with almost every song being memorable and well crafted.  This is an album with lots of poetic, emotional songs, with both introspection and observations about society in general.  Most importantly, though, the songs are musically memorable, with both Bono and Edge's guitar singing on tracks like Mysterious Ways, One, Trying To Throw Your Arms Around The World, &amp; Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.  Other excellent tracks include The Fly, Ultraviolet, &amp; So Cruel.  Love Is Blindness is an almost somber song, changing the tempo from other songs and contrasting with the grungy industrial feel of the album opening Zoo Station.  This album has the energy of the live U2 band, making it perhaps &quot;even better than the real thing,&quot; another solid song from Achtung Baby.  The song &quot;Acrobot&quot; is an excellent ode to hypocrisy, and that title could also describe Bono's vocal acrobatics when he uses his falsetto on the track &quot;One.&quot;  This album is possibly U2's best, and highly recommended for anyone interested in hearing modern rock music's best talent.
B000002U9E|5.0|One of the most powerful music albums ever to be released by a female artist , Kate Bush's \\" Hounds Of Love \\" is an emotionally charged masterpiece . An always honest and challenging personality , Bush displays beautifully her passion over myths , romantism and mysticism on the twelve tracks of this fifth offering of hers . <br />  Divided in two parts , the album starts off with \\" Running Up That Hill \\" , a mysterious love song whose video-clip was unusually brave and dark for that time . An ex-dance student herself , Bush expresses her affection for her other half with some sensual ballet numbers . As for the rest of the tracklist of the \\" Hounds Of Love \\" part , the tittle track becomes strangely addictive with repeated listenings , \\" Cloudbusting \\" remains one of the deepest , most touching songs to have ever hit the charts while \\" Mother Stands For Comfort \\" is a haunting lo-fi gem with Bush whispering \\" Mother will hide the murderer ... mother will stay mum \\" .<br />  The \\" Ninth Wave \\" part obviously tells it's own different story with it's heroin falling asleep , waking up trapped under an icy lake , being executed as a witch and finally being reborn again song after song . \\" And Dream Of Sheep \\" is so rich in feelings , truly magically perfomed by Bush while \\" Jig Of Life \\" is this possesed Celtic perfection with poetry parts read during it's length  . <br />  On deeper analysis there are basically two reasons why \\" Hounds Of Love \\" is so important afterall. Firstly , it sounds as interesting and intense as it did back in 1986 when it was initially released . That was a time when dance divas with steamy sex appeals where sitting on the top places of the charts and there didn't seem to be any room left for something so personal and profound . <br />   Furthermore , Bush was one of the first women to reveal her dark side through her music and she deserves extra credit for that . Ofcourse today there are all these female musicians who will do anything in orderto stand out . Claim that they are depressed , 'sad ' , angry , bisexual ...even mentally disturbed will do just so they can be eccentric and get some attention . Revealing traumas is something like a trend in today's music reality but Bush never really needed to resort to tricks such as these in order to matter . She offered obsessions and raw passion to her public without ever declaring herself a nut . Her multi-dimensional talent shined through . She was a person of her own and that was all . <br />  It's been more than a decade since we last heard of her and there are thousands of fans still hoping for a new Kate Bush record . Various sites on the net inform us that nowadays she enjoys motherhood and a quiet family life . Will she ever release a following to 1992's The Red Shoes ?...Who knows . Fact remains though that her fifth album is flawless , one of those rare records to deserve every five-star review that all these people in here give .
0385335482|5.0|Want a fun read? Want to laugh and escape? Read Sophie Kisella. Read all her books. Enjoy reading in a way you haven't in ages if ever. Reading is fun? WIth this author it is. Bravo!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|First off, of all the CD's I have bought recently, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is the most intelligent, melodic and intriguing albums I have heard.  The songs each create a new sound not familiar to anything Tool or even the first APC album has been able to create.  Furthermore, their cover of &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a fantastic outlook and a great song.  Overall, this is one of my favorite albums of the summer and I have only had it for 4 days.  Also, did anyone notice the purposefulness of naming the CD the &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;.  The Album is the thirteenth step.  Their are 12 songs on the album, so the thirteenth step would be listening to the album in it's entirety.  I dont know if they meant that, but that is what I think of it.  To anyone who is interested I highly recommend the album.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Good record. Great raw guitar sounds and energy. Almost more of a blues record really. But I'm afraid I don't think it's as amazing as some of the press is giving it credit for. Carrying on the great Detroit tradition of raw rock and roll. I've been listening to the new Romantics CD 61/49 (killer) and I'm reminded of how many great influences these two must have had.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FireFly is one of my all time-favorite science fiction shows. FireFly brings it together on all levels... wonderfully written, well-produced and beautifully acted with engaging storylines. I'm so glad it so now available on DVD.
B000002B7O|2.0|I can't believe all the Reviewers who enjoy this album, cuz Personally I find this album to be Dull Sounding compared to Ozzy's legendary debut.<br />&quot;Diary of a madman&quot; sounds VERY rushed. The band was trying so hard to meet that deadline before the tour kicked off. And from listening it Becomes painfully obvious.<br />I pull &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; off the shelf for only 3 songs: &quot;Flying High Again' and &quot;Over the Mountain&quot;, which is a BLATANT Re-Hash of &quot;I Don't know&quot;. The title track is good, Randy played a fine intro. The Rest of the songs are Un-Interesting Filler.<br />Don't get me wrong y'all, I love Ozzy, but I wasn't feeling &quot;Diary of a madman&quot;.<br />Sadly, This was Randy Rhoads last recording before his untimely death, A mediocre set of songs to end a Brief and Amazing life. <BR>Fortunately enough Ozzy redeemed himself with Guitar whiz Jake E. Lee (who in my humble opinion is better than Rhoads.) and returned to form with albums like &quot;Bark at the moon&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;.
B00008EY9G|5.0|It ruins it for people who haven't seen the movie. I didn't read anything about this movie until I was finished watching it. Some posts here are full of spoilers and, if you ask me, shouldn't be allowed to be posted. Let everyone see the movie and decide for themselves. Stop giving away the story. <br /> Bottom line, the movie is great. It is well worth your time, but don't watch it if you've already got the ending.
B00006AFUR|5.0|A must-buy!!! One of the deepest albums I've ever heard. Extremely original and well done. I just can't describe it on words. Trust me, this is an amazing album!!
B000002TYX|5.0|It's interesting reading other reviews of this album. I get the impression that some people expected more of it than they got.  This album is in fact an archeological dig into the Beatles'   other unreleased recorded works and a retracing of their early history. It's not a \\"Hits\\" compilation..Go to \\"1\\", \\"1962-66\\" & \\"1967-70\\" if you want that. Instead, what we find here are early demos, live recordings, a failed Audition with Decca (who have probably kicked themselves up the butt every day since January 1 '62), alternate takes, works in progress, unreleased finished recordings and television & radio performances. For a huge fan like myself, this is a treasure trove especially listening to the development of the lads as musicians and performers through the years 1958-1964 which is the period covered in this volume. Yeah the early, scratchily recorded stuff may sound like crap in parts but, putting things in perspective, these guys were 16-18 year olds cutting their teeth on Elvis, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins etc. How many of these types of bands  sounded great at their first rehearsals especially recorded on such primitive equipment? I think any fan disppointment can be waived here! Besides they are a pointer to what was to follow, particularly with the inclusion and first release of \\"In Spite Of All The Danger\\", the first original Beatles song to be recorded.<BR>The alternate versions really are worth a listen. The acapella intro to \\"Eight Days A Week\\" I think is possibly better than the released verison. \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\" could have been a \\"Beatles For Sale\\" track. \\"One After 909\\" is really interesting in comparison to the released '69 version. The development of songs is the important thing here. There is also the dispelling of myths that the Beatles weren't that good playing live in concert... the Swedish TV performances are quite energetic especially when they could hear themselves play in the early days of Beatlemania. The TV segment with England's briiliant and much loved comedy duo, Morecambe And Wise, is a joy to listen to and even better if you watch it on the DVD. The Beatles hold their own here comedically with 2 very seasoned veterans and the results are really quite funny. <BR>Here was a hungry young band  of 4 working class guys clawing their way to the top, doing what they loved doing. The screaming girls alone only serve as a reminder of what those times and their music meant to a lot of us growing up with the Beatles.<BR>The release of \\"Free As A Bird\\" was much anticipated and it represents the first time that George is given equal lead vocal time on a Beatle track with John And Paul. The track is I think quite strong though it did take a couple of listens to get used to the sound quality. But it's typical Beatles fare that picks up where \\"Abbey Road\\" left off. I get chills every time I hear George's slide guitar kick in and it's beautifully tied in with very \\"Beatlish\\" 3-part harmonies.<BR>Overall this is not the place to start if you're a young person just getting into the Beatles. The album is really quite enjoyable when you take it for what it's meant to be...a great insight into the Beatles at work.
6300183513|5.0|Rear window is one of my favorite movies ever!  James Stuart was superb, along with grace kelly.  This movies was a complete success.  I watched it because a friend  reccomended it to me, but I didn't know he had a good reason for it!
B00005B36H|5.0|Wow! Even 2 years later, this album never gets old! Every song is pure brilliance.<br />1. Grudge - Great song about hate and anger. Slow to start, a little flat at first, but it slowly builds up into a blistering finale. One of the best songs on the album. 5/5.<br />2. Eon Blue Apocalypse - Short guitar number, pretty much filler but interesting anyways. 2.5/5.<br />3. Patient - Moody song about... well, patience. It has a lot of atmosphere. Not the best song but has incredible vocals at the end. 4/5.<br />4. Mantra - Bunch of weird zombie moaning noises. Filler track. 1/5.<br />5. Schism - The first single, good song but has gotten a little stale because I've heard it so many times. It's about silence creating a gap between two people. Schism has a crazy video starring the Osseus Labyrint, who are contortionists. 4/5<br />6. Parabol - Softer, shorter version of... <br />7. Parabola - Awesome song, third single released. Great guitar and amazing vocals. The video for this song completely blew me away. 5/5.<br />8. Ticks and Leeches - The heaviest song on the album. Insane drums and a great ending. Maynard does so much screaming that for a while he wouldn't play this song live. He threw out his voice recording it. 5/5.<br />9. Lateralus - The second-best song on the album, and the second single. The beginning gradually gets louder and louder until exploding into a series of amazing riffs and awesome lyrics. 9 minutes long. The radio-edit version was 5 minutes, and this ironically made me a Tool fan. You see I wanted to hear the full version so I bought the album. 5/5.<br />10. Disposition - Haunting song with few words, pretty soft. 3/5.<br />11. Reflection - The longest song on ANY album I own, and by far the best song I've ever heard. I believe the lyrics are about vanity and narcissism, and they compare the story of Narcissus and Echo to the state of society. The most amazing ending I've heard. 6/5.<br />12. Triad - Wordless experimental metal track, pretty goodsong. 3/5.<br />13 - Faiip De Oiad - Excerpt from the radio show Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. Gets pretty old and isn't really worth listening to. 2/5.<br />If you like music in general, you really need to hear this album because the whole thing is so good.
B000089RVX|5.0|I admit, I for sometime forgot the song Bring Me To Life, since I hardly listen to the radio, however, I got the Daredevil DVD, and out of the 3 music videos on it, it is the only one I enjoy, so I got into the song again.  Since I enjoy the song, I purchesed the Evanescence CD (Fallen) and I do not regret this purches at all.  The whole album kicks ass.  There is not a bad song on the album, it is worth spending the money to purches it.
