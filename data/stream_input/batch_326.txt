B00006M183|5.0|Coming on the heels of an album which I enjoyed thoroughly but one that was too experimental for many, Binaural, PJ comes back to old form with Riot Act.  As the album begins with the wistful Can't Keep, it is obvious they are still older and wiser.  But as the killer opening riff to Save You kicks in, it becomes clear the boys still know how to rock. After 3 and a half minutes of arsekicking, the stunning Love Boat Captain soothes the soul and builds to an epic climax.  Cropduster is another subdued number with some interesting verses and McCready soloing.  The albums 5th track is another rocker, Ghost, which is a surprisingly energetic Ament composition.  The beautiful I Am Mine, definitely one of the bands finer moments follows... the song has riffing and sing alongs up the wazoo, and should please all generations of PJ fans. Thumbing My Way is an acoustic Vedder tune that has very much of an 'Off He Goes' feel to it.  Up next is the excellent and bizarrely techno-ish You Are by Matt Cameron, which ends up coming off as one of the strongest tracks on the album. The next two tracks, Get Right and Green Disease are my favorite section of the album, Get Right beginning with a riff that pummels you and launching into an irrestible chorus, Green Disease doing much the same while at the same time questioning this country's obsession with the dollar and the damage done.  Then its off to Vitalogy-like experimental territory, Bushleaguer would actually be a pretty damn good song with some nice hooks, but Ed's spoken word spiel with lots of big words seems a tad unnecessary. Track 12 finds you at Ament's bizarre and to be honest not so great Help Help.... 1/2 Full finds the band at their bluesy best, with McCready and Gossard just ripping it up all over the place.  The stunning Vedder chant piece, Arc is a segueway into another classic and mellow album closer, All or None.  So basically what you come out with is an album on par with anything that Pearl Jam has released, which is saying alot.  The best band of the 90's may be out of the spotlight, but they never disappoint their true fans, in concert or on record.  I strongly recommend this disc as it is a necessary piece in any colllection of Pearl Jam albums.
B00005JLRT|4.0|&quot;Nemesis&quot; is one of those movies that delivers the goods, except for a couple of confusing plot problems.  As the movie got into the B-4/Data relationship, I was wondering: didn't Data already have an evil counterpart in Lor, from the series?  If so, would their &quot;father&quot; (Dr. Soong) have created another one for Data after Lor?  That was a bit odd...as was the way Shinzon found his way to power so quickly in the Romulan Senate.  But...these are minor quibbles in a great movie.  The original cast is terrific, although I wish Whoopi as Guinan was around for more of the movie.  One thing that disappoints me:  if this is the last of the TNG movies, they never brought back Q (John De Lancie), and that's a shame, being a wonderful actor.  Oh well, enjoy Star Trek fans, you'll enjoy this one a lot!  And, as usual, the score from Jerry Goldsmith shows why he is THE Star Trek movie music composer.  As if you didn't know.... :)
B0000028UK|5.0|Okay. So everyone knows Vs. is one of the best Pearl Jam cd's ever recorded, but is it their best work? The amount of diversity in the songs, from the sad melody of Daughter, to the screaming lyrics of Blood, is what really gives Vs. the respect. And of course there is RearViewMirror, which i believe is the best song ever.  So, is Vs. the best Pearl Jam cd ever, that's for u to decide.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The reviews hinted at what I thought would be an intimate and poignant survival story of one soul through World War II. It was the peformance of Adrien Brody that surpassed all reviews written and defies any attempt to put this performance into words. <br />His every movement, every gesture, tone of voice, his whole demeanor held my attention without pause. The photography is that of &quot;Room With a View&quot; and &quot;Passage to India&quot;. It has the historical scope and authenticity of &quot;Another Country&quot; and &quot;Reds&quot;. You watch in horror that &quot;Humanity&quot; could ever sink and slither to this level.<br />There are few films I could watch again and again, this is one of them. Your eyes need to follow the most subtle details, the myriad textures within each scene. The widescreen version enhances even on our small television screen. This is an important film both historically and in our continued need to self-examine ourselves individually and as a species.
0062502182|5.0|While deployed in Afghanistan a friend gave this book to me.  thank god she did.  It is an easy to read book FILLED with subtle dialogues about life and parables of destiny.  Much Christian and buddhist wisdom is in it with many ancient texts.  It is about the path of a boy who is, like us all, uncertain of his destiny and the risks a fulfilling life involves.  To sum it up, &quot;its the journey your life takes, not where it ends, that matters&quot;.  Its good for those graduated students or young adults who dont know where they belong in life or are afraid to acheive their dreams.  Not recommended for older adults who are set in their ways or highly pessimistic.  Remy!
B000089RV6|5.0|There are some things in rock 'n' roll that not change, even with new technology. In this case, the new edition of AC/DC digipacks that Epic released in 2003, Back In Black is one exceptional example. After listening to the first remaster done by Elektra in 1994 years ago, this came to me like a surprise. the new Back in Black is totally going to blow you away. (if you're an AC/DC fan, of course). The sound is clearer than the first remaster and also contains more information of the \\"making  of Back In Black\\", in other words: liner notes, photos, and more. Being more than 20 years of the first release of this record, the songs (with this new format), are excellent. Songs like \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Back In Black\\" and \\"Shook Me All Night Long\\" are going to stick in your head forever. The fabolous combination of ideas of the Young bros.,and the greatest production of \\"Mutt\\" Lange, make this record a classic, even more with this new format. So, what are you waiting for? Get in to the \\"Back in Black\\" experience and buy this record. You won't be dissapointed at all.
B000060MMI|4.0|Well If you've never listened to flogging Molly, stop reading this review and download a few samples. You'll see that they're amazing and every song is worth listening to. Their songs have amazing energy and are an interesting twist that fans of any genre should enjoy. They're reminescent of the Dropkick Murphy's(exellent band) but are softer though not a bit worse. I must admit that I enjoyed this C.D. more than Swagger. Also for another interesting band somewhat similar, try Carbon Leaf. I'm A king of the kilburn High!
0064407667|5.0|i love this book and all the books in the series. these are truley fantasic books that are written in a kind of morbid,but very funny way.some find these books awful,depressing,and frightening,but i find them to be outstanding and just really funny.the way mr.snicket writes is over the top and refreshing in a world of boring,overly-descriptive young adult writers who write about repetitive topics. he truley immerses himself in the story to a point where you actually have to check the front of the book to make sure it's fiction.he puts things into great analogies (sp?) and always realates one thing to something else that you would never,ever think of.i would reccommend these books to anyone who can see the humor in an otherwise dark situation and wants a new perspective on things.
0375507507|4.0|It was a bit off my interests but recommended by a friend and well, nothing's quite like this.  This is an unvarnished autobiography of a woman who grew up in an atypical family (with its particular piquant tragedies) in an atypical (for them) place.  If you want to know what it's like to actually live in south central Africa, read this book.  It will make you feel the place and a bit of the time in which it was written and may give you some insights into Africa's unique set of problems in this modern age.  It is written well and really caught my imagination, a great read!
B00008NG5V|4.0|the only half pending on when i actually FINISH the cd!<br />There are some tracks on this disc that are so amazing (I.E., &quot;Times Like These&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Cupid&quot;, and &quot;Cookie Jar&quot;) that I just have to listen to them over and over.<br />Someone once said that if I like John Mayer, I'd like Jack Johnson. After listening to &quot;On and On&quot;, I don't think it's a fair connection to make. I love both musicians to death, but it's JM's guitar tricks that make him stand out while JJ has something of actual value to say it and he doesn't have to shove it down your throat. <br />I wasn't a big fan of &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;, but this disc to me is definitely one of the best summer discs I've bought and I would definitely recommend it.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Psychiatrist Chris Kelvin is sent to a space station to investigate why the crew has cut off contact with Earth.  When he gets there, he discovers that the crew is receiving \\"visitors,\\" and soon he gets his own visitor: his wife who has been dead for years.  The crew believes that the planet, whom they believe to be a living entity, is the cause of this, but why?<br />Solaris is not your run of the mill Sci Fi film, for which I am greatful.  For once, a mainstream SciFi film uses scifi as a vehicle for ideas instead of action (something that SF literature has been doing for many decades, Solaris was written in the early 60s).  This is both a philisophical film and a love story.  It's also the most realistic alien I have ever seen in a film; completely enigmatic.  We think it's intelligent (this is based on some comments early in the film, when Chris first sees Rheya), but we can never be sure.  And perhaps Solaris is thinking the same thing about us.  The drawback to a \\"realistic\\" alien is that we the viewer cannot learn anything about it which leaves us with a good number of questions that are not answered.  Indeed, it really isn't necessary to answer those questions as Solaris exists (within the context of the story) only to set the stage.<br />So if you're looking for laser beams and space battles, steer clear.  If you are looking for something to stimulate your mind, then this is definitely worthwhile.
B0000524CY|5.0|Although recorded belief in demonic possession only dates back as far as 500 BC Egypt, earlier civilizations believed in evil spirits. The Judeo-Christian legend of Satan, a powerful evil being independent of God, probably began around 583 BC, influenced by Babylonians who ruled the Hebrew people. Back in 1972 one film decided to tackles this subject matter and it soon became known by every living being on the planet as \\"THE SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.\\" That's right, I'm talking about The Exorcist. One area in which The Exorcist was definitely making the news was around the issue of its rating classification. Despite the initial fears of Warner Bros. concerning the necessarily graphic nature of some of the film's scenes, the ratings board of the MPAA had awarded the movie a lenient R rating without a single cut. \\"There is no confusion about what kind of film The Exorcist is,\\" offered MPAA President Jack Valenti when some concerned parties complained that the film should not have been made available to minors, even if accompanid by their parents. Valenti disagreed, stating, \\"Much of what might concern some people is not on the screen: it is in the mind and the imagination of the viewer.\\" As film art, THE EXORCIST is a true film majesty and personally, the most handsome, awe-inspiring motion picture I've ever seen no mere words can do justice to the incredible impact of this powerful movie experience; it is utterly shattering THE EXORCIST is a movie that will haunt and finally take possession of you. The Exorcist was loosely based on true events that were reported in Washington, DC newspapers in 1949. The story began in Maryland on the evening of January 15, 1949, when 14-year-old \\"John Hoffman\\" and his grandmother heard strange scratching and dripping noises in their house. No explanation could be found for the noises, which stopped after ten days, only to be replaced by mysterious footsteps and drumbeats. After John's Aunt Dorothy suddenly died, the poltergeist-likephenomena increased - with John's mattress shaking violently, food flying through the air and furniture falling over. John and his parents tried to communicate with the poltergeist, which at the time claimed to be the spirit of Aunt Dorothy. Then, in late February, livid red marks emerged on John's skin, taking the shape of actual words. After neither physicians nor psychiatrists could find anything wrong with John, his parents, although Lutheran, consulted a Roman Catholic priest. His recommendations of prayers and holy water only seemed to aggravate John's condition. John's mother took him to St. Louis, hoping things would calm down. But the manifestations intensified. \\"Father Lawrence,\\" a Jesuit priest, came to visit John in St. Louis, saying prayers over him and pinning two crucifixes under his pillow. After he left, one crucifix propelled itself across the room and the other moved to the foot of the bed as the bed shook violently. On March 16, the Archbishop of St. Louis gave Father Lawrence permission to begin the formal rite of exorcism. During the first night of the ritual, marks appeared on John's skin 30 times -- including the word \\"Hell\\" and a portrait of a Satanic visage. The 45-minute ritual was performed several times a night over the next week. John's responses became increasingly rabid, including screaming torrents of profanity and foreign words, violent seizures and uncontrolled urinating. With the parents' permission, John was converted to Catholicism. But his responses to the rituals only became worse. The disturbances suddenly stopped on March 26. Father Lawrence believed John's possession was over. However, they began again on March 31, with John's behavior during the rituals getting even more violent. \\"I am always in him,\\" the demon said through John's lips. After more days of no progress, Father Lawrence read about an 1870 case of possession that provided a key to exorcising the demon. At 11 p.m., John suddenly interrupted the ritual by shouting, \\"Satan! I am St. Michael. I command you, Satan, to leave his body now!\\" After then enduring the most violent spasms yet, John uttered, \\"He is gone\\" and suddenly returned to normal, breaking into a smile. John grew up to live a normal, happy life, with no recollection of his \\"possession.\\"<BR>William Peter Blatty, then a student at Georgetown University, read about John's story in the newspapers. The story stuck with him and 20 years later he fictionalized it to create \\"The Exorcist.\\" Received 10 Oscar Nominations in 1974<BR>Best Picture<BR>Best Actress - Ellen Burstyn<BR>Best Supporting Actress - Linda Blair<BR>Best Supporting Actor - Jason Miller<BR>Best Director - William Friedkin<BR>Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium - William Peter Blatty (winner)<BR>Best Cinematography - Owen Roizman<BR>Best Film Editing - Jordan Leondopoulos and Bud Smith<BR>Best Sound - Robert Knudson and Chris Newman (winner)<BR>Best Art Direction - Bill Malley / Set Decoration - Jerry Wunderlich<BR>Won 2 Oscars<BR>Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, which went to William Peter Blatty<BR>Best Sound which went to Robert Knudson and Chris Newman<BR>Nominated for and won 4 Golden Globes<BR>Best Director - Motion Picture<BR>William Friedkin<BR>Best Motion Picture - Drama<BR>Best Screenplay - Motion Picture<BR>William Peter Blatty<BR>Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture<BR>Linda Blair<BR>A nomination for the British Academy Awards (BAFTA Film Award) in 1975 For Best Soundtrack<BR>Fred J.

B00005RYLE|5.0|This is better than the Mona Lisa. Gore, blood, body parts galore. Who could ask for more? THE EVIL DEAD is a classic in horror movies, and this DVD is great. Cool cover, great features, and commentaries that are actually enjoyable are the reasons to buy it. Trust me; you'll definitely enjoy it.
B000002HJR|5.0|Lead Singer Phil Anselmo of Pantera and guitarist Pepper Keenan of COC are the main culprits here. Along with some of their friends they created a project that will make you think it's 1977 and metal isn't dead. Of course the mighty Sabbath is involved and shows up literally everywhere, but with such force and venom that this record takes a life of its own. On &quot;Rehab,&quot; Anselmo groans &quot;long day lay me low&quot; and you know he isn't fooling. The Skynyrd tinged &quot;Stone The Crow&quot; is a mellow departure from the palm-muted darkness found elsewhere. &quot;Bury Me In Smoke&quot; states the band's ethos of not making excuses for their problems in life; a far cry from the self-pity of most nu-metal acts. &quot;Temptation's Wings&quot; and &quot;Lifer&quot; are based on Sabbath riffs grounded by a concrete rhythm section. There is nothing out there right now like this. And barring another Down album, there never will be.
B00006JJ51|5.0|Hands down, one of the best hip hop/rap records of all time.  The extra tracks are negligible, but at the time, the only other acts putting out material this blistering were Ice-T, Boogie Down Productions, and Public Enemy.  But 'Gangsta' Rap went mainstream with the success of albums like this one, and the results speak for themselves.<br />The beats are still funky as hell--\\"Dopeman\\", \\"Gangsta, Gangsta\\", \\"8 Ball\\", \\".... The Police\\" and especially the wicked title track blow the bass out of your speakers in no time flat.<br />Ice Cube, Eazy E, and Dr. Dre would all go on to make decent, sometimes excellent solo albums, but this one brings it all back home.
B00000IP2L|3.0|After leaving Ozzy Osbourne's band, guitarist Zakk Wylde's 1st BLS record is a hit and miss affair that starts out strong, but fades likes the Boston Red Sox in a pennant race. Cuts like &quot;The Rose Petalled Garden&quot; and &quot;Bored To Tears&quot; remind of Pantera in their sledge-like delivery, forsaking subtlety for in your face punishment. C.O.C.'s southern swagger is put to good use here on a rant about the media, &quot;Born To Lose&quot; and the redemption inspired &quot;Mother Mary.&quot; Halfway through, the album quickly bogs down into plodding downtuned numbers like &quot;Lowdown&quot; and &quot;World Of Trouble&quot; that suffer from lack of variation. However, the quality of the first half excuses some of the 2nd half's faults, but not all of them.
B00003CX95|4.0|It might have been a weak oscar year for all concerned, but after having been dragged into the theatres for &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, and &quot;Babe&quot; in the same month, I was more than surprised when I strolled in on a rainy Tuesday morning to see this film.  It might have been three hours long, but to me, it seemed like it was over too quickly.<br />THAT's the mark of a good film.<br />Now that I've had the chance to view it several times over, I have to first make note of the numerous problems with the film editing--some of the action sequences are cut haphazardly, and historically, the film isn't as accurate as it might appear; possibly for entertainment purposes (because after all, it's supposed to be a popcorn movie too, right?).<br />I realize that this was a labour of love for Gibson, and as a director, he'd already proven his mettle with the film &quot;Man Without A Face&quot;.  But &quot;Braveheart&quot; took us back to the days of cinematic epics, borrowing liberally from &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, and especially &quot;Spartacus&quot;.  It doesn't suffer much by comparison to any of those films, and in many ways, is a much superior film.<br />The cinematography by John Toll and the musical score by James Horner are both first-rate; the best I've seen/heard in ages.  Thankfully, this was also a film made with very little in the way of CGI, something that &quot;Gladiator&quot; made too much use of.<br />If you're a lover of DVD surround, or of historical epics, you can't be without this movie in your collection.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie! I can't put into words how much I loved this movie. I like Moulin Rouge alot but I do think the Chicago is so much better. I liked Catherine Zeta Jones before I saw this but now I LOVE her and think she is one of the greatst actress'. She & Queen Latifah really shine together, and its a shame that they took out the number they did together called Class. This is the best movie I have ever seen and cannot wait until the DVD comes out because I am so excited to watch the special features. This movie proves to be a true classic
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet - nearly 25-years after their demise, Led Zeppelin sets a new audio and visual standard for all other bands to follow - period.  I never got to see Zeppelin live in the flesh, but this DVD certainly makes up for that.  I was planning to see the band in 1979 in Montreal, but Bonham died, and Led Zeppelin was finished - or so we thought.   I watched the two discs with my 18-year old son, also a fan of THE band.  He (and I) knew they were they good on disc, but live, well, they overwhelm.  My son's choice for a highlight - How Many More Times from the Danish TV recording in 1969.  I think I agree - but there's solid, unbelievable stuff throughout.   Another good thing about all this - I think Page's effort will spur other bands into releasing audio and visual gems.<BR>One criticism - at times John Paul Jones is nowhere to be seen. His visual absence is especially noticeable during his beautiful playing on the acoustic Earl Court set.  Too bad the spotlight wasn't shared more fairly.
B000001ES4|5.0|All of the songs in this album are truly wonderful, the violin cries so beautifully.  My favorite song is Illumination, the last song on the album.  If you can listen to this song and not fill your heart with love and tears and joy, let me know!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|It is often the case that much-anticipated movies fall flat - the price of high expectations more than anything else. How wonderful then that this movie's flames flicker higher and brighter than its older sibling's.<br />There are few movies that are GRAND - in vision, in scope, and in their very depth. There are even fewer movies that grip one's soul tightly in their grasp. You believe. You even, dare I say, CARE.<br />Words cannot do this movie justice. The cinematography is breathtaking. The acting is consistently superb, especially the character development of Gollum . Every minute of this nearly-three-hour film is a treat. I did not want this movie to end and I would have gladly watched it again right then and there. <br />It is with a mix of great anticipation yet dread that I now wait upon the final installment of this epic. Dread wins out. Will I ever be able to watch another movie again without automatically comparing it to this one? Will there be any other film I will WANT to watch so much after the final edition closes the chapter on Peter Jackson and his crowning achievement?

B00006G8HX|3.0|Hoping to cash in yet again on the heels of the hugely successful second \\"Star Trek\\" film, \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn\\" (1982), Paramount Pictures produced a third film for the franchise entitled \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\".  This third film took on a new dimension by being directed by the actor who had played the character of Spock for over 10 years, Leonard Nimoy.  This was not Nimoy's first time in the director's chair as he had previously directed two episodes for two different TV series, but it was his first directorship of a big-screen motion picture.  Joining Gene Roddenberry again for writing was Harve Bennett, who had helped to write \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\", as well as Leonard Nimoy, whose writing was not credited.<br />Though Spock's character was killed at the conclusion of \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\", the door remained open for his potential return since his body was left on the Genesis planet, which was a living planet created out of lifelessness.  Still mourning Spock's death was the U.S.S. Enterprise crew: Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commader Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  Kirk is visited by Spock's father, Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), who inquires about Spock's soul.  After a mind meld that confirms that Kirk doesn't have Spock's soul, the two review the events just prior to Spock's death and realize that Dr. McCoy has Spock's soul.  Sarek explains Dr. McCoy must be brought to Mount Seleyah on Vulcan along with Spock's body in order for both to have peace.  Placing his friends above everything else, Kirk and the other primary Enterprise officers decide to steal the Enterprise to return to the Genesis planet, which Starfleet Command has made a forbidden destination.  Having been heavily damaged in the battle with Kahn in the previous film, the Enterprisewas decommissioned, but Scotty manages to secretly prepare the ship for departure.  Meanwhile, the Genesis planet is under study by Kirk's son, Dr. David Marcus (Merrick Butrick), and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis); but a determined Klingon captain, Captain Kruge (Christopher Lloyd, known more being the 'Doc' in the \\"Back to the Future\\" films), wants to obtain the Genesis technology for the Klingon Empire.  The development of the Genesis technology by David Marcus and his mother, Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), was a feature in the previous film \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\", but Bibi Besch did not appear in this third film.  Also, Lt. Saavik, whose character was introduced in \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\", was played originally by Kirstie Alley (best known for her character of Rebecca Howe in the long-running TV series \\"Cheers\\").<br />The most memorable scenes in \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\" include Sarek's visit with Kirk, McCoy's occasional Vulcan behaviors, McCoy's conversation with an alien (Allan Miller) in a bar, Lt. Uhura's conversation with 'Mr. Adventure' (Scott McGinnis), the Enterprise leaving space dock, David's fight with a Klingon (David Cadiente), the abandonment of the Enterprise, the end of Kirk's fight with Kruge, and Mount Seleyah with T'Lar (Judith Anderson).  With Leonard Nimoy absent during most of the film, much of the action depended primarily upon William Shatner, who is not the greatest actor.  The best acting in the film came from James Doohan, DeForest Kelley and Mark Lenard.  Sadly, the sets used for the Genesis planet were not very realistic and much of the action that takes place on its surface was not particularly memorable.  The unexpected Vulcan boy who ages rapidly was played by four different actors: Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis.<br />Overall, my rating of for \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\" is only 3 out of 5 stars because of the lackluster acting during much of the action scenes, poor set design, and anticlimactic ending.  The film does have some good points and is worth watching, but could have been much better in my opinion.  I don't necessarily recommend purchase of the film on DVD, but it does fill in the gap between \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn\\" and \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\", which are two of the franchises best films that were ever made.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This record is flawless. True it's more mellow than thier earlier work, but they've got to mature throughout thier career or they'll never last. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was heavy and a straight to the point kick ... album, Make Yourself was a bit less technical and more formated, but still rocked due to the great song writing by Brandon, and Morning View is a flawless blend of the two of them. Songs like \\"Circles\\" and \\"Under My Umbrella\\" really take me back to the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. days. Tracks like \\"Blood on the Ground\\" and \\"Have You Ever\\" are remenisant to the sound of Make Yourself. But, this album goes way deeper than those records could ever imagine. Let me exlpian.<br />They experimented with this one. There's no doubt in my mind that a song like \\"Wish You Were Here\\" \\"Just a Phase\\" and \\"11am\\" were different for a band that's used to playing a more funky styled brand of rock-n-roll (see Fungus Amoungus). But that's what made the album great. That doesn't mean they sold out, it just means they're maturing quickly in a musical world where EVERYTHING SOUNDS THE SAME! <br />I think \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" best show this new experimental direction and I've fallen in love with this song. If Imcubus continues to go in the experimental direction that they are than they'll be around forever. I know I'll always be around to support them in their audio adventures. To all true Incubus fans who know how good it is to be Hilikus.........CHEERS!
B000002HD5|5.0|To reach the correct conclusion about the Whigs, \\"Gentlemen\\" is not the easiest place to start.<br /><br />The churning, angular (yet beautiful) guitars, and deep-fried misogyny might put you off at first. Persevere, put it away for a year or two if need be, and then take it out when you're feeling rather too happy or rather too sad.<br /><br />In the end, there really isn't anything for it than to lock your jaws on this one, and wonder how things might be otherwise... and whether you (or she) are in a position to do anything about it.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This movie was supposed to be a superhero movie based on a comic.it was more of a love plot.  I gave it four stars because some parts were funny and the fighting,affects, and the dialogue was good.  if those bad scenes were taken out, then i would give it 5 stars. overall, it was a great movie to see a few times. i do reccomend it for those of you who enjoy the comics.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen.<BR>The idea is excellent and you can't get much better for an SF comedy. All I would like to add is the fact that while some may look at it as to a parody of Star Trek and other sci-fi series, it's not really one... It's a plain SF movie, with an action of it's own, with no direct reference to other movies and you don't really need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy it.
0151008116|4.0|This book reminds me of Moby Dick in several ways.  The most obvious reason is that the setting for much of the story is the high seas, but there is more.  While it is an exciting adventure story of survival and exploration, it also teaches you all sorts of interesting things about a particualar profession. In the case of Moby Dick, you learn about the profession of whaling. In Life of Pi you learn about zookeeping, since the protagonist is from a family of zookeepers.  And it is more interesting than you might imagine, even if you are not particularly an animal lover. I do highly recommend the book. You will get more than your money's worth in entertainment value.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars (which I would only give a near-perfect masterpiece) was on account of one isolated chapter that I thought stretched the limits of plausability just a little too far, and because the philosophical-religious element of the book seemed to just trail off for the most part about halfway through the story.  The religious element is basically that the main character wants to follow several different religions at the same time, which is of course not normally done. This theme remains interesting in the first half of the book, but after that it does not develop much beyond the character continuing to have the same ideas he started out with.  The author's greatest accomplishment with the book is the way it is alternately suspenseful, funny, brutal, and thoughtful.  Many authors have tried to mix genres like this, but Martel is one of the few who can actually pull it off well.
B00005JLRT|1.0|In the tenth installment of the Star Trek movie saga, Star Trek: Nemesis tries too hard to atone for the lack of space conflict in the ninth film, Insurrection, and tries too hard to be what Star Trek is not, nor ever has been, about.<br />This film, focusing on the plot of an angry young Picard clone, presented an interesting villain, but an unrealistic concept backing said villain.  While genetically identical to the real Picard, Shinzon and Picard are virtually nothing alike, due to the differences in their upbringing.  The whole idea that they would be connected in terms of thought processes is preposterous, to say the least.  What's more, the plot focuses so much on Picard, that none but the second most interesting Enterprise crew member, Data, truly get any screen time.  For all intents and purposes, this film should have been called &quot;Star Trek: Picard and Data Have an Adventure with a bunch of other unimportant people.&quot;  Each and every other character is wasted, with Riker and Deanna's wedding being virtually the only scene to feature the two in any kind of prominent role, Dr. Crusher and Geordi seeming to disappear completely, and Worf reduced to a drunk who doesn't like to hear singing androids.  In addition, with the film's mood being so dark, none of these characters could even get in any characteristic Trek humor.  The plot parallels between Picard and Data, in terms of Picard's clone and Data's prototype, is interesting, but beyond simply occuring at the same time, share no other connections.<br />The film tries exceptionally hard to make itself out to be an action movie of sorts, with nearly half the film filled with space battles, dune-buggy phaser fighting, and Picard and Data fighting the crew of the Scimitar, Picard's clone's ship, which possesses a bizarre, over-animated &quot;super-weapon.&quot;  Star Trek was always about exploration, strange new life, and life's great journey- not about all the alien butts to be kicked at the end of that journey.<br />Seeing how the Enterprise, as a character in the previous film, was wasted, featured only in a few shots orbiting the planet and running like a scared dog with its warp nacelles between its legs, in Nemesis, the Enterprise is given a half-hour battle with a vessel of Picard's clone.  Not only is it overdone, but it's unnecessary for the sake of the plot- the real action takes place aboard the vessels.  <br />Despite all of these weaknesses, the climax of the movie, and essentially the film's end, brought me to tears.  Data has always been my favorite Trek character, and this scene showed him at his best.  The ending nearly redeemed the film for me, but not quite.<br />If only for the spectacular ending, I gave Star Trek: Nemesis a single star.  See it once for the express purpose of the ending- and then never, ever see this horrid piece of Star Trek history again.
0375421947|4.0|Louisa is unable to break away from Richard Gordon, the older lover who draws her more and more close to him the more chilling his behavior towards her becomes.  Louisa can't understand her inability to leave what most of us would consider an abusive relationship - one in which she paradoxically finds refuge. Gordon remains tantilizingly enigmatic to the end.<br />Sex here is a reflection of their relationship, rather than the basis for it. It's difficult to believe this was written almost fifty years ago - bravo, Ms. Templeton, for finally taking credit for this fascinating novel.  (But for the very last page, this would've been a 5-star book.)
B00005JKN9|5.0|Gangs of New York throws you into mid-19th-century New York whether you like it or not.  From the very beginning we see people living in almost stone-age conditions as members of the Irish gang, the Dead Rabbits, prepare for battle.  The fight against the \\"native\\" Americans led by Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) shows the audience just how savage war can be, especially a war without guns.  One wonders if war would be as common today if they could only be fought with clubs, axes, and knives.<BR>  The world portrayed in Gangs is dangerous, filthy, and fascinating.  Scorsese recreates the history of New York to be unlike anything we've learned in school.  Yet it is accurate and based on characters that really existed - Bill the Butcher, William Tweed, Hellcat Maggie, young female pickpockets, and the gangs.  It's probably the most educational film I've seen recently, but that doesn't mean it isn't exciting and emotional.  The plot, settings, and characters are gripping and satisfying to watch.  Daniel Day-Lewis never falters and has clearly transformed into his malevolent character. Leonardo DiCaprio is surprisingly convincing and shows the conflicting emotions of becoming close to the man he plans to kill.<BR>  Though the film may feel slow or even dull at times to mainstream audiences, it is a great accomplishment and very well-written.  Some of the lines of dialogue, especially from the voice-over narration, are almost poetic and memorable. Howard Shore's score is effective and appropriate as usual and the same can be said about the cinematography and editing.  Gangs is not without flaws, but is definitely worth seeing.  Watching this film re-surfaces my appall at the fact that Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar!
0060555661|5.0|Graham's writing is clear, concise and level-headed.  He warns against unreasonable financial expectations and proceeds to explain his theories in sufficient detail to be worthwhile, without being over the comprehension of the layman interested in investing.<br />The book is lengthy and &quot;solid&quot;, as opposed to other finance books that hope to explain investment in 100-200 pages.  Topics include stocks vs. bonds, inflation, security analysis, and margin of safety (Graham's analysis of the assets of a company in relation to its debt).  Zweig's commentary is useful, with footnotes to clarify historical references and, occasionally, demonstrate instances where Graham's predictions proved untrue.  At the end of each chapter, Zweig uses recent (up to early 2003) examples of Graham's concepts to make things clearer to modern readers.  (Graham's text itself is his 1973 revision to the original 1949 edition.)  Also helpful are numerous references to online articles at various sites (I cannot yet vouch for these links' present state.)<br />Based on my understanding, I highly recommend this edition to anyone interested in this book.  I feel that I gleaned more from this annotated edition than I would have from the original, without having to conduct additional research.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I don't understand how this film won the Oscar for Best Picture.  I also believe that Moulin Rouge was a much better film.  It's set design, costumes, music, choreography, cinematography, and camera movement were amazing and unlike anything I had seen before.  Chicago, on the other hand, was extremely dull and the songs were painful to watch.  Richard Gere should not be dancing, and Zeta-Jones is not very convincing as a dancer despite her dancing background!  Renee Zellweger shines in any role she plays, but not enough to keep my interest throughout the whole movie.
B00005RY7X|4.0|So what if the album's a little bit on the light side, and A.W.K.'s music isn't the most complex, this album still leaves you feeling good. Songs like &quot;Party Hard&quot; and &quot;I get Wet&quot; are perfect head-banging anthems for any occassion. If you're feeling miserly and don't want to spend the money on this short cd, then at least see A.W.K. in concert. I saw him at this year's Warped Tour, and by far, he put on the most exciting and energized performance of all the bands there. What can I say: The man puts on a fine show.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If it weren't for Moulin Rouge, &quot;Chicago&quot; probably wouldn't have been made, at least not right away.  Moulin was a very bold and risky move - How many successful non-animated musicals have been made during the past 20-30 years?  For anyone who hasn't seen it because it looks like something that would make them sick - go see it!  I felt the exact same way until I happened to catch it on cable and was mesmerized by it.<BR>The colors, the music, the dancing, the costumes - they are all spellbounding in this film.  Yet underneath it all lies a tragic love story.  The use of remixed modern and classic tunes was clever and works very well in the movie.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are well-cast and entertaining.  This is Kidman's most flamboyant and comedic role and is very pleasing to watch.  The hype and Best Picture nomination were certainly deserved in this case.  Watch it and be entertained!

B00009RDG8|5.0|This movie was sweet. It had great and realistic action sequences.This movie was a lot like First Blood with a little bit a the fugitive in there, but those movies make a great combination together.

B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce Knowles, 1/3rd of Destinys Child, out did herself on her first solo debut album, entitled Dangerously In Love.  This a a wonderful CD, that will be a classic, such as Aaliyah's, Aaliyah.  The craftsmanship that she put into the album is evident with the first track, Crazy In Love.  Beyonce is a true entertainer, and will be written down in history.  Many people say that they dislike her, but I dont believe they really do, its just that she is a beautiful, talented, young woman, who is doin her thing, at such a young age.  She has the mind, and vocals of a more mature woman.  Her writing skills have improved tremendously, and vocal range has broadened.  Every track on DIL, is a track to listen to more than once.  My favorite tracks are Gift From A Virgo, Me, Myself, and I, Yes, Speechless, Naughty Girl, Daddy (beautiful ode to her father).  Daddy is a change of pace for tributes to parents who have helped artists get where they are.  A lot of artists have songs for their mothers, but no fathers.  So this is wonderful.  Beyonce really outdid herself, on this album, and I enjoy every track on.  It was worth the pushbacks, and the money.  Go get another copy.  And just leave it in the packaging.  Cause it will be worth something in the mere future.

B00005JLYU|5.0|\\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" just may be the hottest ticket going this summer, and with good reason. With three beautiful \\"Angels\\" showing they can deliver the goods while kicking some major butt in the process (complete with an action-packed storyline), it's one motion picture that's difficult to resist, let alone ignore. The film's plotline finds Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) on the trail of two pricey gold rings. Major adventure and high-speed mayhem ensues, as the Angels employ some divine intervention to try to recover the lost rings. Along the way, our dynamite trio meet another Angel, one Madison Lee (Demi Moore), whom we learn is the mastermind behind the entire smugging \\"ring\\". We also learn Lee was once part of the Angels' team, and has vowed to terminate our beloved debonair ladies once and for all. Moore's ex-husband Bruce Willis has a major role (although somewhat brief) as the original boss and holder of the rings, but is somewhat of a disappointment as his character is killed off. At least it was nice to see him get some screen time in. It's also great to see John Cleese make an appearance as Alex's father, although the comedy that was brought to the forefront in his Monty Python films really isn't present here. Even Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith have brief cameos here, for it wouldn't be a Charlie's Angels movie without them present. Bernie Mac as Bosley adds the perfect comedic touch to a dramatic display that's one part James Bond combined with one part, shall we say, Monty Python (!)?  Well, maybe not Python, but as for the \\"comedy\\" aspect of \\"CA:FT\\", maybe something more along the lines of the \\"Airplane\\" movies would be a more accurate description. Although this sequel tends to drag in a few places, it is worthy of all five stars for its star factor and rewatchability quality, which makes \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\", an all-out, horsepower-driven affair that's sure to entice, as well as delight, even the most fussy of moviegoers this summer season.

B00002Z88D|5.0|Out of the weird 80's only Metallica really survives as an essential metal band with a decent amount of influence over artists such as Creed and Korn (for better or worse). Yet they have not been brushed off into the dusty shelves of rock trends that came and went, Metallica still sounds pretty damn good and those who attacked &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; were deaf to the idea that Metallica can actually play complex, dare I say wonderful-sounding songs. The &quot;S&amp;M&quot; album, their live collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and composer Michael Kamen (who's fame comes mostly from his film scores and hit movie songs such as &quot;Have You Ever Really Love A Woman,&quot; I hope that tidbit doesn't make Metallica fanatics cringe), is artistically their most accomplished work because it manages to take the heavy, sometimes voraciously heavy, elements of Metallica's brand of hard rock and elegantly mix it with classical music like no other metal band has ever done. One reason it works so well is because Metallica's songs have never been confined to the borders of their time, like Led Zeppelin they have a sound and lyrical identity that helps them still retain their impact decades after the original release dates. A lot of the arrangements here are epic and grand, such as with &quot;Nothing Else Matters,&quot; Metallica's most powerful ballad which here takes a great classic quality, like a wonderful song to listen to in the evening. &quot;The Call Of The Ktulu&quot; also feels like a symphonic blast while &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; has a visceral edge brought-on by the atmospheric violins, this is the same with &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot; which feels more emotional here. James Heatfield's snarling and sometimes meditative vocals along with the band's crunching sound nicely compliment the orchestra's grand brushstrokes. If anything, the orchestral elements make the songs even better than they first were. Even &quot;Sad But True&quot; still sounds threatening with an orchestra back-up as well as &quot;Master Of Puppets.&quot; Metal, at least good metal, has always had a kind of symphonic stamp, consider how guitarist Kirk Hammett's fingers dance around the strings. The &quot;S&amp;M&quot; album is for Metallica fans and rockers who enjoy good MUSIC aside from the energetic vibe, it is Metallica's artistic gem and one they can feel proud of when retirement comes (if it ever does).
B00006JIA4|5.0|Those who have followed my reviews and my particular style of music may be shocked to see this review. Yes, I like Queen. In fact, I love them. They are simply the best band in the history of the world. No one cam compare to them - not Pink Floyd, not the Rolling Stones or even the Beatles...well, that's just my opinion. Freddie Mercury is truly one of the greatest vocalists the world has ever seen. His personality and flamboyant style was truly one in a million, and he is still sadly missed more than ten years after he passed from this earthly plane, to no doubt rule a higher level of consciousness.<br /><br />I myself had never bought a Queen album until I purchased this collection, but just from these three greatest hits CD's, I can easily call them my favourite band ever. That's how good they are. I will probably buy a lot more Queen albums in the future, but at the moment I'm just content with my copy of \\"The Platinum Collection - Greatest Hits I, II & III.\\"<br /><br />Disc 1 is definitely not the best of the three. It starts wonderfully with the mammoth classic, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" The song is regularly voted the greatest song ever written, and topped the UK charts in two separate decades - shifting more than 1 million copies on both occasions. \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" and \\"Killer Queen\\" follow. Both huge hits, and undeniable classics. The album sails along with more brilliant songs such as \\"Fat Bottom Girls,\\" \\"Bicycle Race,\\" \\"You're My Best Friend\\" and \\"Don't Stop Me Now.\\" The disc finishes superbly with \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions.\\" I challenge anyone over the age of ten to listen to these songs and not love them. It's a crime that the younger generation are not very interested in Queen...<br /><br />Disc 2 is the ultimate highlight of this collection. It opens with a true triple-threat: three fantastic classics in the form of \\"A Kind Of Magic,\\" \\"Under Pressure,\\" and my personal favourite, \\"Radio Ga Ga.\\" Two more songs pass, and then it's on to the absolutely amazing masterpiece that is \\"Innuendo.\\" Freddie knew that he was dying of AIDS when he wrote the album of the same name. He wanted to go out on top, and he definitely did. This song is excellent, and Freddie's vocals have never sounded better, despite the fact that he was very weak at the time of the song's recording. \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" is Queen's greatest ballad ever. So slow, so moving, and so thought-provoking. I sat listening to this song in my garden one night, looking up at a sky filled with stars and a full moon. I can't describe how euphoric I felt about the process of life and the universe - how we're all here, and how we all die. Is that our purpose? To be born, only to die? Interesting. \\"Headlong,\\" \\"The Miracle,\\" \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" follow up. All the songs are superb. Why? Because it's Queen, obviously. The album finishes second-to-last with \\"The Show Must Go On.\\" This is another song recorded around the time of Freddie's death. He finally sings \\"The show must go on!\\" towards the end and it echoes. It's as if he has died once he sings this, and his voice echoes for eternity. Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Disc 3 is a good, but sometimes weak effort. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" starts the album, but this is a duet with Elton John. \\"Under Pressure\\" follows, but this is the duet with David Bowie. Freddie's unique duet with Montserrat Caballe, \\"Barcelona,\\" is another highlight. \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You,\\" \\"You Don't Fool Me,\\" \\"Heaven For Everyone,\\" and \\"Las Palabrad De Amor\\" are, yet again, all fantastic. The true highlight of this album comes with \\"Living On My Own.\\" This UK No.1 dance remix is amazing, and you really see Freddie as every inch the legend when he opens the song with \\"De do, de do, day!\\" which echoes. It sounds so blissful and heavenly. The beat is amazing and the lyrics are just superb. Queen's duet with Wycelf Jean, \\"Another One Bites The Dust,\\" is good, but it so does not have a patch on the original! Towards the end of the album, we have \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives.\\" A true classic, this ballad topped the UK charts in December 1991 after Freddie had passed away.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Freddie Mercury is every bit a legend. He is a true rock God, with the greatest male vocals ever. Elvis doesn't even come close to him. No one can touch Freddie, he is truly unique. It's such a shame that he died in 1991, but once he did, he left the earth and in his place stands an icon. I dare anyone to listen to this collection and not be converted to a Queen fan.

B000099T2L|1.0|I have given this CD &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; several spins, and this CD is NOT growing on me.<br />The only song, and I mean ONLY STANDOUT song is the first title on the track - and you guessed it &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; which is currently and definitely deserves to be No.1 on Billboards Hot 100 Singles Chart.<br />&quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is a well written, sung, produced, crafted pop song - that hasn't come around since Madonnas 1990s &quot;Vogue&quot; or Chers 1998 &quot;Believe&quot;.  These type of pop songs come around unfortunately not very often.<br />After you hear the first title track none of the songs on this CD come close.  There is no contest.  However one other song is possible single potential &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;.  As for the rest of the songs such as the ridiculous &quot;Gift from Virgo&quot; and the I need a female featured rapper Missy Elliot &quot;Signs&quot; are just muddled messes.  The duet with Sean Paul is just a hazard produced fiasco.<br />They might as well called this CD &quot;Dangerously in Love with Astrology&quot;.<br />The CD falls flat with boring ballads that just go in one ear and out the other.  Beyonce needs to definitely improve on her musical writing skills with a hook, chorus, break, etc.<br />I feel all the energy was put into the first single &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; and the rest of the album is complete filler.<br />A real disappointment.  I was really looking forward to a good album. An album with all packaging and no content except for &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is why it gets 1 star.  Without this single this CD is garbage material.

0385507755|5.0|It is both interesting and dissappointing to read some of the reviews of this book.  Some people just dont get it.  Yeah, there are part of Frey's story that seem a bit embelished or far fetched, but who cares?  This is the first book on addiction I have read that clearly explained what it feels like to be an addict.  The power and emotion of Frey's story is unmatched.  His writing style reminds me a bit of James Ellroy, which can be a bit clippy and hard to follow at times, but again, who cares?  Once I got into this book, I could not put it down.  It is a great story, like &quot;sleepers&quot;, which people with too much time on their hands had to question as well.  And anyway, how do any of us know what really happened.  This is a great book, and I think anyone that wants to learn more about the frailty of the human mind will find this book life changing.  For those of you that have to question everything, stick to fiction, where you won't have to worry about the validity of the story.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I've been a fan of the band ever since a friend of mine introduced their music to me, just before 'In the End' hit it big.<br />I'm extremely satisfied with this CD. Some of the reasons are that the songs are diverse, yet connected by similar, but always impressive and multi-faceted vocals by Chester Bennington (who so easily goes from a screaming voice to a softer singing one) and Mike Shinoda.<br />1. Forward - not much to judge, as it's barely 15 seconds long, but it leads perfectly into the second song. 5/5<br />2. Don't Stay: Not the most amazing song on the CD, but not without it's strong points. The lyrics have a good flow, but the overall effect isn't very strong. 3/5<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: The intro to this song is great, for lack of a better word, which I frequently replay. The chorus is a bit predictable, but the singing by Chester and Mike is good. It's an effective song. 4.5/5<br />4. Lying From You : This song is different from the previous ones. The chorus is the best part of the song. 4/5<br />5. Hit The Floor : More rapping in this song than sing (or rather yelling). For people more partial to rapping, this song will have more appeal. Mike's rapping is really good, though. 3.5/5<br />6. Easier to Run : This is the first of four standout tracks on the CD that I replay repeatedly. The lyrics are exceptionally well put together and have a great rhythm, and Chester's singing is brilliant. The song is simply beautiful. 5/5<br />7. Faint : The intro is very effective. The song's tempo is quick, catchy and Mike is at his best in this song vocally. It's difference from the other tracks is also a plus-factor. 5/5<br />8. Figure .09 : The song sounds familiar, but it's good enough. Seems a lot like the formula used on some of the song's in 'Hybrid Theory'. 3.5/5<br />9. Breaking the Habit : Six years in the making, this song is beyond amazing. The lyrics are excellent, and leave room for different interpretations (I thought it meant something different than some of my friends did). The singing is perfect, the music perfect. One of the best songs by the band. 5/5<br />10. From the Inside: This song is almost haunting, especially the chorus. This is a song I have yet to tire listening to (often multiple days). Mike and Chester complement each other, and it's amazing. 5/5<br />11. Nobody's Listening: The lyrics here excellent, but I'm not fond of the Japanese flute used. The song does however grow on you after listening to it repeatedly. It is also mostly rap. 4/5<br />12. Session: Interesting to listen to, another song to showcase Joseph Hahn's talent, but I feel the drums were a bit much. 3.5/5<br />13. Numb: Good song. Pleasant to listen to, doesn't stand out, but is overall a great song. 4.5/5<br />Overall, I highly recommend this CD. The lyrics, while being really good, may be melancholy at times, but it's worth it. It didn't leave my CD player often. It's a great CD from a talented band who shows devotion to their work (as shown in the DVD), and an enthusiasm that more bands need to show.<br />Buying the enhanced version with the DVD is also a recommendation, if you enjoy behind-the-scenes type stuff. Highlights were seeing the creation of the large mural-like artwork the band made, and hearing the amusing 'Wizard Song'. Also seeing the haunted building sequence was great as well as some studio footage.

Sure, the Douglas Fairbanks version was glorious, and Douglas Fairbanks was dashing, but it was silent.  This one isn't.  It seems like everytime, Errol Flynn would burst into his infectious laughter.  This exuberance, plus the magnificently staged swordfights, clever banter and breathtaking stunts, make this movie the blueprint for such hits as Disney's 1953 \\"Peter Pan\\" and the various permutations of \\"Three Musketeers\\".  (Peter Pan even wore green tights.)  Swinging ropes, ladders, tumbling tables and stools, we needed Jackie Chan to remind us that props were once glorious elements of movie fights.  In 1938 \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" had them all.
B00004U30D|5.0|This first time effort from Director Sam Mendes illustrates a family on the verge of implosion.  Kevin Spacey leads an excellent cast, including, Annette Benning, as his shrewish ***** of a wife, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari, are also good, as well as Chris Cooper, who's ex-military father character, and who is more than a bit obsessed with his son's life, is a scary fellow.  Kevin Spacey rules, as a man who wants to be happy, and through his attempts at happiness, reverting to an earlier time in his life, to impress the young hottie (played by Suvari) become a tragic, comic, figure.  Benning also seeks happiness, in the arms of a fellow real estate broker, but ultimately feels unfulfilled. The rest of the cast, including a low-key, plain, mousy, performance by a pre-West Wing Allison Janney, are excellent.  It's a very twisted story, but a good one (with a decent soundtrack).  The special edition features a second tape with behind the scenes interviews and other features.  It might be too technical for those not interested in all the details, but might make an interesting study for film students, seeing the genius of a first time (film) director.  Worth its five awards.
0446677450|1.0|First of all, readers need to recognize that this book is marketed towards those who do not have a solid grasp of financial and economic principles. That said, it's imperative that readers use their critical eye when examining the author's many dubious and unsupported claims. <br />The book starts off well, asserting that the traditional model of success -- doing well in school and going straight to work thereafter -- is not working in today's economy. That may be acceptable to believe, but everything Kiyosaki says afterward becomes incredibly hard to swallow. <br />He throws in many pragmatic principles in the first chapters, such as having more assets than liabilities, becoming your own boss rather than working for someone else, and possessing financial literacy.  These principles are indeed important, but could have been stated much more concisely than intertwining them with his childhood stories. Although interesting, these childhood anecdotes do not necessarily make the principles any easier to understand (most of the financial ideas are simple to begin with). <br />The trouble begins when Kiyosaki over-generalizes his conception of those who are rich and poor, and also when he overstates his claims without specifics or evidence. For instance, Kiyosaki talks about how menacing taxes are and why the rich are not so susceptible to its evils. He explains that the &quot;rich&quot; use accountants and lawyers to avoid taxes, while the poor are all-to-eager to pay the government. This assessment is overly simplistic, although easy to agree with. How a poor person can afford any of these tax avoidance luxuries is beyond Kiyosaki's grasp. He simply advises his readers to start a &quot;personal corporation&quot; in order to take vacations under the cover of a business expense. Ethics aside, there is no specifics on how to create this corporation, nor any explanation on how it would work. Kiyosaki simply states that it worked for him, hoping readers will accept his claimat face value. <br />Besides too many repetitions of the same principles, Kiyosaki also relies on an annoying strategy of circular logic. He suggests to his readers that owning a business where you don't work but take in the revenue, owning stocks, real estate, and other assets are the key to becoming rich. If readers don't already know these basic tenants, than they might forget that possessing most of these assets requires substantial wealth to begin with. <br />In all, there are few financial principles among the mass of over-simplistic claims made by the author. While it's remarkably easy to recognize the author's narrow view of success and penchant for greed, it is much harder to see the author's incompetence at explaining how to become rich. Like everybody else, he is adept at spinning an illusionary web of fantastical desires mixed with practical financial advice; the result is a disingenuous narrative and a lack of substance.  Readers would get rich quicker simply by not buying this book.
0930289455|5.0|OK, I love this book.<BR>I know it's Alan Moore's superb writing and Brian Bolland's incredible artwork. But it's the little friggin' details that sold me on it.<br />1. Like another famous Morre book, Watchman, there is a beautiful segue in each section of the book. Look at the last panel of any section and then look at the first of the next. See the associative context? It's brillian and, having seen it in Watchman also, I heva to believe it is a collaborative effort between the writer and illustrator, rather than just the artist alone. I love it.<br />2. The comparison between the results of devestating loss upon two personalities, Batman and the Joker are wonderful. Is Moore saying there is little difference except by our perception? The Joker kills people for no reason, he destroys them and ruins their lives, just like his was destroyed by random meaningless events, like his wife's death. So he destroys randomly with a purpose of tortured logic apparent only to himself. On the other hand, Batman preys upon the criminals.  \\"Destroying\\" their lives and works, from their point of view. They are taken away from their family and friends and placed in prison, a \\"loss\\" to their families, etc. They don't really understand why he does it, some silly rules from their point of view. It's only because our perspective is on the side of \\"good\\" that we seem him as the hero and Joker as the villian. If we were evil, we would see the reverse. But both sprang from a horrible incident that affected their sanity. They are Yin and Yang. The Joker causing Chaos, Batman trying to cause Order. That is what makes the Joker's smile so chilling. It is a grimace of pain and madness, and we, who are psychologically designed to respond favourably to a smile, are constantly confused and horrified.<br />3. The Joker went one way, the Batman another, what would happen to Gordon? Well, he goes a third way, he doesn't change, he stays himself in response to the horror. Would it have been different if Barbara had died? Maybe. Maybe having to be sane to be there for here anchored him. <br />4. The \\"joke\\", that for their constant battle to end, they both, each clinically insane from any psychiatric point of view, would have to trust each other is perfect displayed in the last few panels. The fact that they both understand this and realize the status of their mental states is driven home by their reactions to the story. <br />This is a great book to show to anyone who thinks that \\"comics\\" are simplistic tales for kids. It is short, It is brilliant, it clearly takes a legend that has been around for decades and gives it, at this date, a remarkable new twist that affects the way you see the characters moving forward. To take the \\"red hood\\" story line and make the Joker a pitiable if not understandable character is genius. I would have to say this rates right up there in my top 5.
B00006JDVV|2.0|This disappointer had some strong potential, but ultimately copped out.  The opening scene where the first male dragon escapes from the London excavation site was building some real frightening suspense, but it then BLOWS IT by suddenly jumping ahead twenty years later.  WHY wasn't the story about the dragons destroying the world as those posters and trailers falsely conveyed?  That would have been a far more satisfying movie, because it would have delivered much large scale action and scary tension.  It could have also been intriguing to further expand on its premise when the scientists finally discover that the dragons caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.  NO SUCH LUCK.  As it is, this humdrum B flick only has a few fleeting moments of any real action, as the dull story just plods along with plotholes galore.  They had a pretty cool initial idea, but then just sat on it. BORING!!!  I know that many would like to see an epic PREQUAL showing how mankind is eventually destroyed in the fierce, massive war against the dragons.  Guess Hollywood will never get hip.
0743243153|4.0|<BR>In this 70's self-help book, Peck seeks to usher the non-religious into a program of spiritual growth by proposing that a commitment to psychological wholeness and recognition of (and acceptance of) personal responsibility essentially equates to spirituality.<br />The book is both a religious theory and a self-help manual rolled into one, and ultimately suggests that by committing one's self to personal responsibility, psychological health and the pursuit of truth we are in fact, whether religious or not, bringing about spiritual growth in ourselves and others and more or less aligning ourselves with the creative force (call it God or whatever you want) of the Universe, of which we are all a part.<br />While forming a cohesive theory, Peck's ideas borrow parts of Buddhism, Christian Mysticism, New Age thinking, Jungian psychology, transpersonal psychology, and who knows how many other traditions.  <br />In a nutshell, Peck asserts that life is difficult; an unending series of proplems if you will.  And that accepting this basic truth is the beginning of the journey.  &quot;Discipline&quot; as he defines it (delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing) is our toolkit for facing and resolving life's problems and growing (psychologically and spiritually) in the process.  He incorporates into this process definitions of spirituality and Love, and goes on to lay out a theory of God, Grace, evolution, consciousness, etc.  He even deigns to explain sin and the ever-debated &quot;problem of evil&quot;.<br />Ultimately I found his ideas excellent food for thought, and the self-help portion of his message a worthy framework for making changes in one's approach to life.  But, having read widely on the subject of religion, spirituality and consciousness I found his foray into these areas quite simplistic and myopic (written from an entrenched position as a psychoanalyst who ironically, despite his exhortations for us to see things from another angle, couldn't seem to see things though any other lens than a therapist's - explaining almost every spiritual and psychological problem as laziness on the part of the patient).<br />Overall this book is well worth reading and great food for thought.  I'll probably go on to read his later books to see how his thoughts evolved over his career.<BR>

B00009L1TA|5.0|Plain and simple. Excellent movie. For those of you who don't understand the movie, it's really not that hard. It's kind of got that &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; ending feeling. Smooth and satisfying. If you don't like it don't watch it again. If you do, then buy it. Nuff said.
B00009V7RF|4.0|Anyone else out there notice that a lot of the songs borrow from De La's Buhloone Mind State?
B0000931QA|4.0|This concept album can best be described as a classic cult favorite, and for good reasons.  Although it lacks the subtle beauty and different shades of 'The Walll', it is equally engaging.  The downside is a striking lack of sonic experimentation and production by Rush knob-man, Peter Collins, which is a little flat and inferior to Neil Kernon's work on the previous record, 'Rage for Order'.  The sound is a bit more improved on this remaster, but not drastrcally, I recommend picking up the remastered 'Operation: LiveCrime' (1991), on which the versions of some of the tunes are even better than the original (e.g., \\"Spreading the Disease\\").<br />1. I Remember Now/Anarchy-X/Revolution Calling.  Borrowing the title from The Clash and style from \\"In the Flesh\\", the narrative introduction is followed by the anthem establishing the motivation for the main character and the scene for the story.  This is easily one of the high points of the record.<br />2. Operation: Mindcrime.  The first plot point is revealed in the title track, another rocker engined by a Black Sabbathesque riff, as the main character is lassoed into a conspiracy.<br />3. Speak.  This has a manic guitar riff and a really great sound, establishing the cult of personality of Dr. X.<br />4. Spreading the Disease.  All of the themes, \\"religion, sex, and power plays\\", are poured out on this rocker, perhaps the best song on the reacord, even if the narrative element is a little glossed-over (i.e., the sexual relationship between the main character and Sister Mary).<br />5. The Mission.  A heavy and narrative-driven \\"ballad\\" with some really nice, atmospheric chords and vocals.  (NOTE:  The live version included at the end was originally released as a b-side to \\"Silent Lucidity\\" and is not particularly different from the original.)<br />6. Suite Sister Mary.  For the main character, the plot takes a turn for the worse at the beginning of this centerpiece and magnum opus of the record, featuring female vocals asthe voice of Mary.  A little long and indulgent, but very atmospheric, as compared to the rest of the tunes.<br />7. The Needle Lies.  The fasted rocker on the record is probably the weakest tune, as suddenly, the issue of drug addiction is injected into the plot line - perhaps a bit late from a narrative standpoint.<br />8. Electric Requeiem.  This is really a short electronic piece and one of the few experimental elements that isn't just a straightforward rock song (similar to the second side of 'Rage for Order').<br />9. Breaking the Silence.  This is one of the catchier tunes and was attempted as a single release.  From a narrative standpoint, it is somewhat disposable and redundant with the next tune.<br />10.  I Don't Believe in Love/Waiting for 22.  As with 'Breaking the Silence', the band released this steady rocker as a single because it has a rather generic chorus, and in fact, it is one of the two entries that made it to the 'Greatest Hits' compilation.  <br />11. My Empty Room.  This last narrative element is another snippet-of-a-song and has a nice dramatic seque into the finale.  (NOTE:  One of the bonus tracks to this set is a live take circa 1994 that attempts to turn it into a somewhat ambient stand-alone track.)<br />12. Eyes of a Stranger.  The philosophical sum-it-all-up is one of the most memorable melodies from the collection, as it should be, even if the chorus is a bit cliche.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Having just seen The Two Towers for a third time, I know that is one of the best of 2002 and one of the best so far of this decade. The first film seemed so unbeatable in terms of effects and adventure, but this takes it to the next level. There were some liberties taken with the book, but they don't hurt the story too much. I actually thought the elves fighting at Helm's Deep showed how noble they can be. It improves the audience's view of them. Even though all three films were shot together, all of the actors seem to be much more comfortable in their roles. This really seems to be Aragorn's film. That's not a bad thing as Viggo's Mortenson's performance is excellent. Gollum also takes centerstage as one of the most pitiful characters to hit the screen. He was portrayed well by Andy Serkis. Elijah Wood does an excellent job as Frodo. He's not the same hobbit he was in Fellowship, now he's beginning to understand the power of the ring and the pain it causes. Sean Astin gives a very innocent performance as Frodo's faithful companion, Sam. He also deliver one of the touching lines in the movie. Of the three story lines followed in this part of the mythical tale, the interaction of Pippin and Mary with Treebeard was my favorite. I was worried that the ents might appear silly but instead they come off as very wise vand calm creatures. As good as the theatrical version is I'm sure the extended version will improve upon it. With 43 extra minutes the epic will be even more monumental.
B00006RINF|2.0|Many reviews have already been written here, but my particular perspective is of a listener that has never heard Lacuna Coil before and chose it on the recommendations of a friend.  He said \\"They have a good sound, so long as the guy isn't singing too much, but this new CD supposedly has less of him\\".  This, sums up Comalies nicely for me.  I bought Evanescence's Fallen and Comalies at the same time, put them in my car and drove.  I have to say that if you can hear track 1 on here or elsewhere, listen to the point where the male singer starts...that will kill it for you. The woman's voice is strong and has good range but somehow she is mixed in less than clearly...I thought it was an effect until the guy comes in, clear as a synthesized automaton droning away the English lyrics like a speech program.  The guy can carry a tune, but all the while I am hoping against hope that he will go away and the lady will sing more.  Hearing some of Scabbia's great voice then mostly this guy is like eating cherry-flavored broken glass.  The reason I like Evanescence more is that they understand it's all about the woman's voice.  They let the guy chime in a little then get out.  Lacuna Coil seems to have made some 50/50 pact or something and it ruins the disc.  My only other complaint is that their instruments sounds overly synthetic, as if they have a good idea of a crunching sound but no heartfelt soul is in there.  Tech-down the instruments and let the woman sing!  Then I'll buy the next disc.  I'd give it 3/5 but the sheer disappointment of close-to-great sound makes me resent it more.  Call this 2.5 of 5.
0385504209|5.0|I loved this story; couldn't put it down. The blend of fact &amp; fiction made for a great read. The author knows how to tell a suspenseful story and the ending was just perfect!
B00008LDPU|5.0|If u have seen Matrix Reloaded, i will tell u that it is true what they say. To get the whole story u must watch the animatrix, play enter the matrix, and see the Matrix Reloaded. After doing all three everything will come together. So do so............ this movie is a must have along with enter the matrix game
B00009L1TA|4.0|I'm a big Travolta fan and I like seeing him step out of the box of his previous typical roles but this type of character seems to be becoming more of his typical role these days.  Unpredictable.  Headed up by an all star cast of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Giovanni Ribisi, Basic is full of action and twists and turns.<br />It gets a little hard to follow at times but is generally good.  My big time pet peeve is Connie Nielson's acting.  Her thick southern accent which was very prevalent in the beginning of the film seems to disappear much of the time and then she remembers &quot;oh, I'm supposed to be southern!&quot;  If you're being paid to act as a certain character, I'm real big on staying in character.  Ribisi played his character really well but I'd give anything for him to have used another dialect.  I can't even beging to explain how annoying it was, so much so that for me, the dialect detracted from the brilliance he was trying to bring across.  Another peeve is the cinematography can be annoying.  The rain in the beginning shots is the most horribly computer generated rain I've seen in years.  In the DVD extras it shows one scene where Sam Jackson is ragging on a soldier and it was a brightly lit set...on film it's raining and just done badly.  So if you're not nit picky, you probably won't notice or care.<br />Overall worth the rent/buy due to the plot, just keep your eyes peeled and your brain sharp!
0385507755|3.0|James Frey's memoir of addiction gets off to a harrowing start and manages to sustain the momentum through the first half. It is stark, bold, and wholly unsentimental. But then things start to slide. James' parents visit him at the clinic where the reader is treated to page after page of sentimentalized touchy-feely \\"you don't understand my feelings\\" psychobabble that reads like an Afterschool Special, albeit with an edge. Things pick up again toward the end but by this time the shock of the new has worn off and it's become just another memoir by just another former addict.
B00000DC10|5.0|You could read a dozen glowing reviews of this album, but still have no idea what to expect. Here's a better idea: buy this album, crank your stereo as loud as it will go, and listen to \\"Summerholidays vs. Punkroutine\\". See if you can go the full 4 minutes and 35 seconds without throwing furniture. It's just that good.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This was an absolutely great movie. Me and my girlfriend rented this one night after hearing about it on the Radio, and this has now become one of our Favorite movies to watch together. It's a very Dark Romantic movie involving Control, & Submission, and done in a tasteful way. This is also a great \\"In The Mood\\" movie for those who want to explore new directions with their intimacy.
B000002UAU|5.0|The only other albums that can compete with this are other beatle albums (abbey road or the white album,perhaps),but then again,all beatle albums are 5 star gems,always have been,always will be.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I'm so happy to have bought this album.  Even though recordings by Green Day &amp; Sum 41 might have been better, this is still really cool.<br />  Travis Barker again proves that he deserves the punk drummer award that Modern Drummer gave him.<br />  Mark Hoppus is brilliant, and the most talented singer on the album.<br />Tom Delonge rips through the guitar, great playing.<br />I would give Dumpweed, Don't Leave Me, Aliens Exist, What's My Age Again, Dysentary Gary, Adam's Song, All The Small Things, The Party Song, and Anthem a 10 of 10<br />Mutt and Wendy Clear get a 6.<br />Going Away To College Gets a 0.
6304698658|5.0|Well over a year ago, I posted a review on this particular DVD version of the movie.  In that review, I complained about the fact that it was only made available in the full screen format.  Well, only moments ago I just recieved a confirmation on a SPECIAL EDITION release of \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" which will contain a nice new anamorphic widescreen transfer, as well as commentary by Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, et al.  <br />So, at long last a holiday tradition is getting the treatment it deserves.  I highly suggest you hold out until October when the funniest Christmas movie ever finally makes itself worthy of being added to a DVD collection.
B00009UW0N|1.0|It appears that this release is simply the theatrical version of the movie, which I can't say I prefer. I really enjoyed the extra material that they shot for the television release, which puts it at 104 minutes as opposed to 91 minutes of the theatrical version. For me, thus far, the only good version of Halloween on DVD came when they released the extended version on DVD some time ago. With it, it included the R-version of the film, which is discernable by watching the opening scene with Michael in the mask, with no edit and overlayed template to mask his sisters breasts as he brings the knife down. I am sure the new release will be welcomed by some, due to the new transfer and captioning, but I can't say that I will be buying this one.
B00006CXXU|5.0|She's broken barriers and Walls to make this album. The old Christina Aguilera is out of the window, and finally, the much anticipated (2 year wait) full, all new English Title Album is Out. <BR>Stripped is not your average Teeny Boppy \\"Baby One more Time!\\" It is a collection of gorgeously composed modern 'classics' ranging in genres from the obvious R&B (which she has truly mastered) to Gospel, Rock, Latin, and some decent Soul. <BR>The Lyrics, well, not entirely over the edge, yet each song seems to talk more than just hot sales and \\"East Coast, West Coast\\" junk. Certain self-confidence and life journey issues were raised. It has been a long wait, and it deserves every second of it. Stripped is a smashing hit, and it is mostly by Christina herself. Definitely worth the listen and collection. .
B000007489|5.0|This album still holds up nearly 20 years after I first listened to it.<br />This is the best example of mid 80's California punk that there is.
B00006RINF|5.0|From the chilling beauty of &quot;Aeon&quot; to the agressive passion of &quot;Angel's Punishment&quot;, Lacuna Coil's &quot;Comalies&quot; is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Thier style is something similar to Paradise Lost in that they combine the sweeping romanticism of Goth with the heavy guitar riffs of metal, but really their sound is all their own.  The vocals of both the female and male singer are outstanding as well, not to mention the deep lyrical content.  All in all this is a band you can't afford to miss.  Skip over the joke that is Evanescence and listen to the group they wish they could be.
B00006879E|5.0|I am about to buy this album after having seen these guys open for John Mayer and Counting Crows.  Maroon 5 has an excellent refreshing sound that blew me away.  I had only heard their chart song 'Harder To Breathe', but after listening to them play a full set, I can't wait to get my hands on their album.  I am typically old school rock (70's), and these guys have a sound that made me think of bands like the Stones, Deep Purple, and a bit of Doobies.  Even my daughter, who is a definite music critic, was jumping up and down and thought they blew away Mayer and the Crows.<br />Adam Levine's crisp vocals and steady pitch were awesome and the rest of the band completed the story without drowning him out (typically happens in a live show).  They carry an expressively unique bluesy rock sound with explosive guitar riffs. They are destined for good things.
B00005JLWN|5.0|It is not often that moviegoers are given the opportunity to view an unforgettable Sci-fi flick such as Equilibrium. Most so- called &quot;Science Fiction&quot; flicks now days, aside from the classic star trek movies, are Hollywood simply trying to please a mass audience that seems to only respond to blood and gore and sex scenes. Equilibrium gives us true Sci-fi fans the feeling that we are reading a classic Ray Bradbury novel, complete with great characters, subject matter that leaves you pondering for days and not to mention some of the greatest action sequences ever put on the big screen. Not only do these action scenes entertain to no end, but they also boggle the mind with the amount of intelligence it must have taken to come up with the &quot;sword fighting with guns.&quot; WOW!
0156027321|5.0|Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of \\"This is the Place\\" and \\"Harkening\\"<br />  Life of Pi by Yann Martel is getting quite a run from book clubs,the media and Amazon Reviewers.  It is the darling of the big time reviewers, as well it should be.  Still, I think that readers ought to be warned.  It seems to be misbilled, as it were; that may be why I was tempted to shelve it before I became entranced.  I want my gentle readers to resist the urge.  That's why I'm mentioning this petty little annoyance in the face of what some are calling a work of art.<br />  Life of Pi is a combination of Kon Tiki, (Remember Thor Heyerdahl?), Moby Dick and The Old Man and the Sea.  A fine tradition to be sure.  It is well written but I just couldn't get a handle on point of view right away.  Nor could I immediately discern whether this book was, in fact, a novel as the cover proclaims, or a creative biography, a memoir or...Well, you get the idea.<br />  Hang in there. Once Pi, our hero, is on a lifeboat with a tiger, you won't care what kind of book this is, whether the tiger is a symbol or real.  You'll just want to be there for the ride, be there for the amazement.  Still, I don't advise you to skip those first 70 pages.  The flyleaf suggests that this book will \\"make you believe in God,\\" and, in order to realize its promise, you'll need what is written there.  Be patient. At some point, you'll understand why this is so.<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson is the author of the award-winning \\"This is the Place.\\" Leora Krygier, author of \\"First the Raven\\" says  it \\"paints us a picture of Utah, love, family and intolerance in beautiful strokes.\\")
0316096199|3.0|I was raped.  My experiences during and after (the hospital, police, life) were far different from Alice Sebold's.  The thing I liked least about this book were her generalizations to all rape victims, or survivors if you choose.  She writes sentences such as, \\"When you're a rape victim you become a celebrity,\\" referring to all on her college campus who knew of her rape.  The sentences she writes in the second person, \\"When you're raped...\\" are simply her experience.  She presupposes we all had her experience.  I didn't become a celebrity; I was not treated by the police nor the hospital any way close to how she was; and, my life that followed differed very much from hers.<br />However, the passages in the book--however brief--that did describe emotions I feel or felt were powerful for me.  I reread a couple of paragraphs as I was reading, just to see again - someone else knows *this* feeling, has *this exact* feeling.  Some of the sameness of emotion made me feel connected.  Most of our emotions, reactions, and actions--and those of the people around us--were very different.  I feel resentful when I read or hear people speak of rape victims (and perpetrators) in finite and discrete categories of human behavior.  Choice, too, is huge - many of us didn't have the opportunity even to pursue a criminal case.  Many victims don't have supportive families or friends.  She was indeed lucky in many ways.<br />While this is one woman's story, and I respect it as that, it is written as a more universal story than it is.  I am not like Alice Sebold.  We were raped at a similar age and are close in age now, yet we are very different.  This is one book for/about a rape victim, but it's a memoir and not a guide.  If every sentence that she wrote in the second person, or that purported to generalize her situation to others', were changed to be simply in memoir format, the book would be greatly improved.<br />As well, but less important, I was unimpressed by her writing skills to the point of distraction.  Nevertheless, the read is fast and easy, and the book not overly long.<br />Take a look - it's a glimpse into one woman's experience; but, for the sake of the rest of us, don't take it as gospel.
B00005UW9T|5.0|This story is wonderful for children instead of knowing the horrible truth of what really happened to the Romanaughf Family. It follows closely up to the point of Anastasia being still alive (but in truth she really died)Its still a wonderful movie telling a romantic and comical side of the story. The villan Rasputin is just as funny as his helper Bartok (the bat). It is hysterical watching and listening to the conversations the two of them have. With a wonderful and romantic ending the whole story is tied up in a bow. I highly suggest it to parents looking for a funny movie for their family.<br />The only precaution i have is that some younger children may be scared by the beginning of the story but all and all kids will enjoy it.
B000068VHQ|5.0|I have been a fan of the Cranberries for a very long time, and although I love each and every one of their cd's, this one is by far the best.  Dolores writes and sings with such passion you too can not help but feel the exact emotion she felt in every song.  Every song on here is marvelous and will just blow you away.  From the up beat \\"Can't be with you,\\" the anger driven \\"Zombie,\\" to the moody \\"Daffodil Lament\\", you will find yourself lost and mesmorized by this cd.  Do yourself a favor and forsake all the heartless POP music that is out now, and grab a copy of this CD, or any of their CD' for that matter.  You will be happy you did and disappointed that you didn't sooner.
6304342160|5.0|I saw this in the theaters when it first came out in October 1996, and immediately became obsessed with it.  Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon are not only beautiful, but they play their characters to perfection.  Their sex scenes are incredible, by far the best I've seen on the silver screen.  The movie itself is bloody and violent, which is to be expected in any movie about the Mafia.   I highly recommend this movie.
B00007CVSH|4.0|Admittedly Verdi's &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; is difficult to stage effectively. These dificulties result from the opera's somewhat insane plot coupled with the stature of the artists able to effectively cope with the score. Elijah Moshinsky' has overcome these difficluties with great success.  He's moved the story from 15th C. Spain to 1865 Italy whereby the political conflict becomes Imperial Austria vs. Garibaldi's revolutionary forces.( This is a nice choice considering Verdi's nationalist proclivities.) This device works well as a backdrop to the interactions of the opera's four main characters. The sets and costumes by fim designer Dante Ferretti and Anne Tilby respectively create a film-like atmosphere worthy of Zeferelli.<BR>The choruses are marvelously integrated into the action, be they gypsies or Schlager dueling Austrian soldiers, and intensify the developing friction that fuels the opera. The principal singers are strong and well suited for their roles. Dimitri Hvorostovsky's Count  di Luna is an elegant controlled antithesis to Jose Cura's &quot;macho&quot; rogue Manrico. Yvonne Naef is downright scarey as Azucena. Both her voice and acting capture the gypsy's tortured obsessiveness. Unfortunately the lovely Veronica Villarroel's light lyric soprano is hard pressed to cope with Leonora's role, which definitely requires the power of a spinto soprano. Although her acting is heartfelt and powerful enough to make this Leonora believable, Verdi's score is too heavy for her instrument. Nonetheless, this &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; ensnares us in the passion and grandeur that is opera.
B000002NC4|5.0|harkens to the glory days of extended play with songs that soar in to the 7-8 minute range and keep you glued the whole way. My stepdad who grew up on stoner rock of the 70's immediately took a shining to this album. Don't know how he does it but doug martsch channels the 70's gods of guitar on every track. genius.
B00005OM4N|5.0|OK, So Britney is obviously the best female singer/dancer out their. She also is the most entertaining. This album shows how Britney has grown up. The best songs on this album, well they are all good but really the best are I'm a slave 4 u- This is really the most dancible song on the album, Overprotected- This song is very self explanitory it really tell you about what she feels, Lonely- It probbably should have been a single but i guess she didnt feel it, I'm not  girl, not yet a woman- This is obviously the best track on the whole album it just shows how well Brit can sing, Boys- Um ok well the co-ed mix was much better but this is still very good, Anticipating- This song is singable and dancible it really hott!, I love rock 'n' roll- Mabe it wasnt commertiolly released here BUT! its still awesome, Cinderella- well honestly this song should not have been released on this record, the song is good and all but its just not a song i would have choossen, i think instead of When i found you being put on the Austrailian version cinderella should have. and it would be a bonus track, Let me be- I love this song its really good!, Bombastick love- awesome and a good dance tune, Thats where you take me- i wish it were a single it would be a great video, What its like to be me, Probbably one of the best tracks on the whole album its really good! Well their you have it i recomend this album to anyone!
B00005JKN9|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I don't like Leonardo very much since his big thing with Titanic and am not much for heart throb actors, but he did a great job in this one. This movie was gripping and made me sit in awe for most of it. I didn't mind it being a long movie because I wanted to see more. I thought it had sort of an old western shoot em up flair to it, and I just loved it. It was gorey in some places and children should not watch this. I wouldn't say it was a porn like some suggested with all the sex scenes. I thought it was fitting for the time it represented. While watching this movie, I kept thinking how awful it must have been to live in that time period and not be able to bathe. The actors just looked stinky. Kind of a weird thing to say in a review, but it is true. It was very believable. When you sit and hate some of the characters, they are doing a good job. I didn't see any poor acting through the entire movie. I would sit through it again and have already recommended for family to watch it if they haven't. Caught my attention, and I don't think any movies I watch for awhile will be as good.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Well. I had initially heard about this band on MTV, strangely enough. I'm not a big MTV watcher but they were doing a show about movie stars in music and they showed a brief snippet of the video for \\"Capricorn\\" and mentioned that 30STM was actually a rather good band with Jared Leto from 'Fight Club' fronting it. <BR>I've been interested in Jared Leto's acting for a while so I decided to download a song just to see what his band was like and I came to find one of the coolest sounds I've heard a band have in a long time. <BR>They've piled tons and tons of production into this record (just listen to \\"Echelon\\" to understand what I mean) to provide for a great lush sound on this record. At first glance they would appear to be much more well written and thought out band in the vein of Orgy or the Powerman 5000 of old. But honestly, I liken this record more to a Tool type of sound. The lyrics are thoughtful and interesting and not really as pretentious as you would expect a hollywood hearthrob type to make. <BR>Also, as I understand it Jared Leto wrote and recorded 75% of this record, playing most of the instruments on it and co-producing it as well. So you're really basically getting one guys vision instead of the culmination of several peoples.<br />The enhanced section of this CD is a bit disappointing. It has a ton of live footage but with the studio versions played over it. I really find it annoying to see live footage with studio sound played over it. But that's just me. There's also a nice behind the scenes look. And a video for \\"Capricorn\\"<br />I really like this record and I realy hope that this band stays around and makes more records like it.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Here is the truth behind the \\"first woman executed in Illinois\\" which is very important to the movie \\"Chicago\\", (Renee Zellweger sees her execution). \\"Chicago\\" is set in the 1920's, (not 1930's as I previously wrote).  According to an internet site discussing regional executions-the Midwest; Elizabeth Reed, a 40-year-old housewife was the first woman executed in Illinois. She was hung on May 23, 1845, (for murder), in Lawerence County. The only other 2 women executed in Illinois were: 22-year-old Angelo Giancola electrocuted for murder, and 38-year-old Marie Porter, electrocuted for conspiracy to murder with Ms. Giancola.  Both died on January 24, 1962. The crime took place in St. Clair County.  These were the only 3 woman executed in Illinois before 1968.  Obviously, \\"Chicago\\" is guilty of being historially innaccurate.  The film also has a another problem in that any good ballastic expert should have been able to show that the furniture salesman and Renee Zellweger could not have both been reaching for the gun at the time he was shot. I.e., angle of bullet wounds, location of body, entrance and exit wounds.      In spite of the fact that \\"Chicago\\" is neither correct to the date of the \\"first woman executed in Illinois\\", and holes in the claim; 'we were both reaching for the gun'; I still think the movie is well worth seeing. By the way, the \\"Pianist\\" receieved the History's Channel's Harry award for the most historical accurate movie of 2002, \\"Chicago\\" wasn't even among the other 4 movies being nominated.
B000002UAR|1.0|The following were the best periods for the Beatles:<BR>1968-1969: White Album, Abbey Road<BR>1964-1965: Meet the Beatles, Hard Day's Hight, Help<br />Skip the Revolver, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour period; especially Revolver.  This album is dominated by lightweight pop tunes in which the Beatles don't play as a group (like Here, There and Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby) but instead are backed by orchestra tracks.  <br />On songs like And Your Bird Can Sing, Dr. Robert, and Taxman the Beatles are great, but the closing song (Tomorrow Never Knows) is just chaotic experimentation which is supposedly insightful, but it makes for poor listening.  Although these songs are good, they can't compensate for the weakness of the rest of the album.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|In a world where music is getting duller by the moment it seems, only a few make it to the top. Most of which are by their looks and not their talent, none of them really behind a reason for what they are doing other than to get famous. t.A.T.u. on the other hand, has a reason along with looks and talent. Maybe their music isn't the best, who cares if they do or do not they write their own songs, or if they really are in-love with each other or a scheme. One thing they have shown is strength, not to take criticism about what other people may say about them. As they have said themselves, this album is to help teenagers (like themselves) to find who they are and that it is o.k. to love whoever they want.  And as you listen to their songs, you can see them trying to get this point across.<BR>     I recommend this CD to anyone. For it's not just the music, but the reason behind it. I know for a fact, that a lot of people have been touched by what they sing and that it has helped them in many ways. Even though it may be repetitious in English, in Russian it is far more complex than you would think. As I conclude my review I again want to recommend it for anyone, and if you like them you might also want to check out their Russian album.
B000002J09|5.0|The stuff on this album is unlike anything else. This group must have been plugged into some other dimension, especially at the time this album was made. Calling this album a \\"rock\\" album is to cheapen it, as it is in a category all its own. The caliber of vision and creativity that this album represents is a rare thing in popular music. It's more than just good music.  There's an indescribable quality to it that sets it apart. Even the song, \\"Rock and Roll,\\" which is patterned after your basic 1950s Jerry Lee Lewis rock song, has a certain quirkiness of personality that makes it much more than that. <BR>  It is said that the most important thing about good art is that which can't be explained, and this album has it in spades.
7119005901|5.0|Imagine my surprise when my eleven year old son placed a few names from a video game (Dynasty Warriors) into Google and came up with biographies of real Chinese warlords. Investigating I found that the game was based on Chinese Literature, a historical book written in the 1200s about 3rd Century China by Luo Guanzhong. My son promised he would read the book if I ordered it. The book as ordered is printed in China and is broken into four 600 page sections. I did buy it and with his background from the game he sailed through all 4 sections in record time with nothing but high praise. I have read it myself and highly recommend it to anyone. We have also purchased the TV serialized DVD collection, in Chinese with English Subtitles, which is absolutely facinating viewing for those who have read the original books. The DVDs require staying power there are 58 of them put out by Chinese government TV studios. The recording quality and the subtitle errors are a bit of a deterent to all but real Three Kingdom Fans. If you are expecting a slick Hollywood film dont buy the DVDs.
0140067647|5.0|This was Penman's first novels and still one of my favorites. A little trivia: she actually hand wrote a good deal of this novel, lost it and then started all over again. That's commitment! SUNNE traces the life of Richard III, breaking it into three sections of this 800+ page novel:<br /><br />PART ONE sheds light on that confusing Historical time known as the Wars of the Roses. For those who never truly understood it, you will. The War was basically one of cousins who were all descended from an ancestor king. Add a weak king to the pot and we have a civil war. Anyway, during that period, we get to see a very young Richard and the many relatives he lost to the early Wars of the Roses. Major players such as Richard's older brother, Ned (i.e. future Edward IV), are revealed as are the monk-like, insane King Harry (Henry VI), as well as his wife, Margerite Anjou . . and let us not forget Richard Neville, the Kingmaker, who at one point during his life, held two different English kings captive. During this section, Ned eventually prevails for the Yorks and becomes King Edward IV. Immediately, he has a clash of wills with his cousin, Richard Neville, and this sets up the scenario for . . .<br /><br />PART TWO: where Edward IV takes the throne and immediately unsettles everyone by marrying into the Woodville family, taking Elizabeth as his queen. Unfortunately for everyone, the Queen has a poor personality compared to her ravishing beauty, which creates a number of conflicts. Richard, who is heaped with honors, is not comfortable in court nor are the Neville Family, as well as many other allies. Edward IV keeps them all from killing each other and also puts up with more Lancastrian attempts to seize the throne, as well as an eventual civil war with his Neville cousins, and his very antagonist brother, George, Duke of Clarence. George also makes life hell for Richard's love interest, Ann Neville, but, in the end, Ann and Richard are married. Continuing friction grows on all sides as Ann sees that Richard is overlooking the flaws of his brother, Edward IV.<br /><br />PART THREE: follows us as Edward IV's reign spirals downward. His ailing health and his methods to contain a very sensitive secret force him to not only slay mad King Harry but his brother, George, as well. Of course, other reasons are used but that's another story. In the end though, Edward IV's lifestyle catches up with him, leaving his kingdom in an upheaval. Richard III is appointed as the protectorate of the realm until Edward's son comes of age, but, in truth, the Queen and her people do not trust him. Civil war is averted when Richard captures the heir to the throne but even then, things are going badly. Richard loses his one blood son and his allies begin to turn on him. Worse, someone else murders the children in the tower (i.e. this is one of Penman's interesting points where she claims Richard III is not the villain portrayed by Shakespeare) and blames Richard. In the end, Richard loses his wife, feels he is cursed and takes a number of risky measures when a distant Lancastrian pretender to the throne (i.e. future Tudor dynasty) challenges him on the battlefield. Through betrayal and circumstances, Richard III is slain and the Plantaganet line dies out with him.<br /><br />After re-reading many of Penman's novels I have to say that this is still my favorite. Unusual that a first book is written well enough to be comparable or better than later books but there you have it. Penman's writing strengths are in her vivid descriptions, her real and varied characters, her build up of conflict and conclusions and, of course, let us not forget that her love stories are pretty good, too.<br /><br />Overall, this is sterling silver quality, so read it right away. Fans of George Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE should know a good chunk of this historical period influenced him greatly.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A; HISTORICAL ACCURACY: A minus to A; ACTION & WAR SCENES: A minus; WHEN READ: 2003 (third reading) (revised review in March 2012); OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.
0312954468|5.0|Simply Superb! I don't think there's anything else to be said about this masterpeice. It may not be one of literature's greatest historical accounts but it certainly is one of the greatest action-packed yet emotionally moving adventures that modern readers will come across. Okay, so readers have to suspend their beleif to accept Taita as a multi-maestro in practically every aspect of life (well, almost every one.) but once you get past that, I guarentee you will not put this book down. The first half is a bit slow but it is very gripping and the 2nd half is very fast paced with superb action sequences awaiting you with almost every half dozen pages or so. <BR>  Don't listen to the mindless negative reviews here. Read the book and decide if you like it nor not. it's not just your average action-adventure yarn. It's the extrodinary story of one very extrodinary man.It's both emotionally moving (especially the end)and crammed with action. Read it.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is an extraordinary book with a lot of thought-provoking themes that do not come through until the end of the book.  A wonderful read that I raced through in a day on the plane and that kept me up the following night while my brain tried to work through various spots in the book.  I particularly enjoyed the questions posed by the book at the end, they are intended to make you think on deeper levels and expose you to what the author may or may not have been trying to get across.  I highly recommend this book for everyone!
0800196767|5.0|We have several videos on hand for our Grand Daughters when they come visit us at the Beach and it's raining.  My 5 year-old, Christina, never gets tired of seeing Matilda.  She know every character and most of the lines.
B00006AW2M|4.0|What's amazing is how BAD I expected this album to be, after so many people maligning it over the years. But it's not, not by any stretch of the imagination. TSMR is an intriguing concoction--it's not pure psychedelia at all, but rather attempts what could be called blues psychedelia. Actually, the album it reminds me of most isn't Sgt. Pepper, but rather Odessey and Oracle by the Zombies, which is one of my favorite albums of all time.<br />Songs like &quot;Citadel,&quot; &quot;The Lantern,&quot; and &quot;2000 Man&quot; have superb guitar work, which is much more muscular than much of the psychedelia of that era.  One of the other strengths here is the percussion--in nearly every song there's some quirky backbeat being used.<br />Not everything works, of course. &quot;Sing This All Together (see what happens)&quot; is their version of the Velvet Underground's &quot;Sister Ray&quot;--interesting in theory, almost unlistenable in practice. &quot;Gomper&quot; can get tedious. But replace &quot;Sing This All Together (see what happens)&quot; with &quot;We Love You&quot; and &quot;Dandelion&quot; on this album and you would have a minor masterpiece on your hands. Still worth picking up--it's almost never boring, and it sounds like nothing else in the Stones catalog, and maybe like nothing else, period.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Very Good. This movie was one step below First Contact and much better than Insurrection. The only thing that disappointed me was the way Data said good bye. It was very stoic.They could have added one more line and had him say &quot;It's been fun&quot;. This would have shown that he had understood emotion and closed out his character more completely.<br />As for plot points every ST movie has holes in its plots so why are people making a big deal of them? Stop with the over analyzing and just enjoy it for what it is.
B00005B36H|1.0|I saw a lot of stuff about how awsome and amazing TooL is and everything, so I decided to try them out.  I heard Schism, and I thought it was okay, but not to great. Anyway, I've concluded that TooL is not what it's lived up to be.  TooL is not very good at all, in fact, it's horrible.  Totally horrible. I would not reccomend this CD to anyone at all.   I was hoping TooL would be better than this, and Manyard would have a decent voice.  I can't stand listening to his awful singing.  Ugh.  Maybe I'm missing something. Don't waste your money on TooL, and listen to something better, like Taproot.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Finnally, Ive worked out the track list that should have been on this album, it just fits in 1 CD (80 mins) nicely, and it does cover well all of the hits in her 90s career, the selection is heavily based on singles from her 4 studio albums (Erotica, Bedtime Story, Ray Of Light, Music), so theres not enough space for Something To remember like YOULL SEE or ONE MORE CHANCE but, come on, I'm sure any Madonna fan have owned that CD already, so you dont really need its hits on this GHV2 collection, am I right???<BR>Well, I tell you my version of GHV2, If any one would like to record to an MD, CD to create their own version GHV2, this is the one I recommend to you guys!<BR>Remember, to choose the edited version, so they can fit in 80 mins<br />1 - DEEPER AND DEEPER (radio edit) 4:53<BR>2 - EROTICA (radio edit) 4:30<BR>3 - BAD GIRL (radio edit) 4:39<BR>4 - RAIN (radio edit) 4:33<BR>5 - I'LL REMEMBER 4:20<BR>6 - SECRET (radio edit) 4:30<BR>7 - TAKE A BOW (radio edit) 4:30<BR>8 - BEDTIME STORY (radio edit) 4:05<br />9 - HUMAN NATURE (video version) 4:30<BR>10- YOU MUST LOVE ME (video version) 3:03<BR>11- FROZEN (radio edit) 5:08<BR>12- RAY OF LIGHT (radio edit) 4:33<BR>13- DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE 5:10<BR>14- THE POWER OF GOODBYE 4:10<BR>15- BEAUTIFUL STRANGER (radio edit) 3:55<BR>16- MUSIC 3:45<BR>17- DON'T TELL ME 4:40<BR>18- WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL 4:43<br />There you go,<BR>- I wouldnt include FEVER, AMERICAN PIE simply because they are just the covers of other artist, not real Madonnas songs<BR>- some may want to replace DROWNED WORLD with NOTHING REALLY MATTERS but I think DROWNED WORLD has got more dynamic though it was not a single, it does have a video, and you do see it on MTV.<BR>- some may want to replace YOU MUST LOVE ME with DONT CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA. They are both fabulous tracks, its up to you to choose one of them, but dont choose both, it would soung a bit out of place and boring in the entire album<BR>- wat about THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND...!!! mmm I dont know, to me it sounds out of place in this album, theres obviously no room for it, if you have SOMETHING TO REMEMBER<BR>you definitely don't need it it here. even I'LL REMEMBER, but I let it appear twice, because it sounds nice, and flows well with the rest.<BR>- this is my suggestion, its up to you to make your own GHV2
B00008WJBU|3.0|I saw the preview and really wanted to see this movie. First of all I thought it was in English...it wasnt. This isnt bad the preview makes you think it'll be in English. The movie was slow at some parts and not as fast paced as the preview makes it out to be. There are better foreign films out there.
0385504209|5.0|Read the Amazon reviews for this book and took a chance.  WOW, what a great read.  Haven't read a book this good in quite some time.  Took it to the beach for vacation and finished it in two days.  Could not put it down.  I highly recommend this book.
0385504209|5.0|Professor Robert Langdon of Harvard University is in Paris to lecture and meet with a curator of the Louvre. Instead, the police take him from his hotel to the Louvre, where he finds the curator murdered. He is stunned to find that all evidence points to him as the murderer of a man he had never met. But Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer and granddaughter of the curator, shocks Langdon further by maneuvering him into escaping from the police. On the run, she explains that she does not believe that he murdered her grandfather. The curator was the head of a secret society that dated back to the time of Christ and protected a great secret. She wants to find the secret. Pursued by police, they soon find that they are also pursued by the murderers. To their astonishment, they find that the secret they seek is nothing less than the Holy Grail. Their breathtaking flight extends from France to London and on to its climax in Scotland. Brown's ending of his story is less than thrilling, but the chase, which occupies most of the book, is well worth reading.
0316666343|5.0|This book is easily the best book i have ever read, however i am only 15 and have little time to read.  this book- unlink any other book, play, or writing- made me get to think (thats pretty hard) and although i hate reading i have read this book 3 times, and i the middle of the fourth.  this book is extremely touching and although someparts are gruesome(sp?) it makes you wonder many things, and if this book can make me care about charectors, i certain you will care about them too.  i do not think that this book was made for a certain audience but for anyone, i picked up this book with the worst expectations (i had just finished adromeda strain and rainbow six) so this book was not the kind of book i thought i would like, but the way it touches your heart should make any human love this.
B000001FP8|5.0|Bon Jovi is the epitome of an American rock band. Jon is Zeuss of the vocal world hitting high notes and punding out choruses with his strong voice, and Richie is the amazing god of guitar, and with tico on drums and david on keyboard and alec on bass, they are simply astounding *for more words of how amazing they are, look at the insert of &quot;One Wild Night: 1985-2001 Live&quot; and the little foreword). The have longevity, which is a huge factor. I am as die hard as they come when you talk about bon jovi fans, and i believe that this is their best album. From Bon Jovi to Bounce, this is truly the best. My favorites off the album are &quot;Blood On Blood&quot;, &quot;Stick To Your Guns&quot;, &quot;Wild Is The Wind&quot;, &quot;Love For Sale&quot;, and of course &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, one of my favorite Bon Jovi songs of all time. I'd recommend this CD to someone who already owns Slippery When Wet, the one that just predates this one by 2 years, and likes it. It's a totally different sound from 'Crush' and 'Bounce', and even 'Bon Jovi', their solo debut. If you guy it, you'll find it's worth every penny. You WON'T be disappointed.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is simply an experience. I will admit right out that it may not be for everyone. However, in my humble opinion, Alice Sebold has created a story that is so full of depth and emotion that it is almost eerily easy to picture the lives of the characters unfold before your eyes. As each page turns, the characters lives continue on, their lives being told through the eyes of a 14 year old girl. That innocence of a child is never lost, and the perspective never ceases to be truthful. Through this truth, the tragedy, the love, the comedy, the life of all the characters comes through shining, be it while a grandmother fixes herself her favorite drink or a man finds himself at the center of an unexplainable miracle, the truth and life behind it is remarkably clear. <br />I encourage everyone to at least try this unique read, and I hope that you enjoy the experience, however potent and emotional, as I have.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This is not emo. Alot of bands lately get labled emo. It may be a cool word but this band doesnt sound emo. This is some catchy as hell pop punk with a little dark hardcore mixed in MCR style. Great music great lyrics. Its nice to hear some music thats not too whiney week or death metal heavy. If youve ever heard an MCR song and liked it buy this record every song is good.
B00000F14B|5.0|My high school recently did this musical this past year, but I had been a fan of it before. I was infected by my mother, who would play different musical tapes in the car as I was growing up, The Music Man included. After I saw the movie for the first time, I was hooked.<br />For a screen adaptation, there really is very little change from the stage show. Marcellus is given a job, Harold's longish first scene in River City is split into multiple scenes, Shipoopi is given a full Ice Cream Sociable production...all changes and adjustments that make the transition from stage to screen easier and better. They all add to the show as a movie. And don't even think about watching Disney's new horrendously drab version.<br />Nothing can be said about this movie if you don't say something about Robert Preston. As has been said, this is the role he was born for. His performance is perfection itself and there's no wonder as to why the citizens of River City fall for him. I know I would have! He's the ultimate con artist who, yet, manages to be entirely wholesome at the same time. You never once want him to get caught and, really, get what he deserves. (After all, he /does/ scam tons of people out of money.) And, in a rare moment for a musical of this era of classic musicals, we get a glimpse at the insecure, dreaming man behind his charismatic, self-assured mask. (Preston's perfection in this role only hurts Matthew Broderick's totally boring performance in the new version.)<br />Shirley Jones is a competant, if unremarkable Marian. (The one shining star in Disney's version was Kristin Chenoweth's amazingly emotional and real performance as Marian.) The rest of the cast give wonderful, strong performances. It's especially wonderful seeing a young Ron Howard as an endearingly tone-deaf Winthrop. This is a show that, besides the two leads, really, is a show of caricatures. So many of the supporting roles are wonderful character roles and they are all filled wonderfully, from theentire Shinn family to Marcellus to the Barbershop Quartet (the last filled memorably by the Buffalo Bills themselves).<br />As a movie, the film is bright, quick, and comfortable. It's a fun, all-American romp with a comfortingly ambiguous ending, (Obvious Harold and Marian will marry, but what will Harold /do/? My mom insists that he learns to be a real musician and conductor and lead the band, but we just don't know.) and catchy, singable music loaded with wonderful brass sounds.
0743244249|4.0|In &quot;Cosmopolis,&quot; DeLillo's language is more controlled and self-assured than most of his novels. There is a stream of consciousness here that his other novels do not have. As usual, DeLillo's descriptions are often excellent (he even composes a few rap lyrics midway in the book). But at other times, he falls into over-analyzing objects, ideas, people, that have no real significance and ultimately test the reader's patience. In doing this, DeLillo &quot;waters down&quot; an excellent novel. Some editing here and there would have helped.<br />Usually, DeLillo's characters are cardboard props used as mouth pieces for his own ideas. In &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; DeLillo attempts to make them more vivid, especially in the main character of Eric Packer and his stalker. Packer's other acquaintances, even his wife, however, are not developed well and are rather forgettable. Packer's journey through New York is rather interesting. Along the way, he learns the President is in town; a famous rapper's funeral is proceeding through the streets; and he is being stalked.<br />The last 60+ pages of &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; are worth the price of the book and provide the reader with a vivid and impressive climax.<br />Recommended.
6304708491|5.0|All I have to say is wow. What an awesome movie. It was pure ecstasy to see the Beatles acting and making jokes. I'm so happy I finally got this movie. A MUST SEE for any Beatle fan. If you're not a Beatles fan you probably will still enjoy the movie but you wont catch on to certain little things like when the musicians in the restaurant are replaced and the new musicians play the tune to hard days night. Plus, in some parts it can be difficult to understand the dialog. The second time I watched this is picked up a number of different things. Heh, gotta tell you though, the best scenes are definitely the attempts to get the ring back and the fight scene at the house (with Paul's adventure on the floor)! You should really give this movie a chance.

0316666343|3.0|I finally got around to reading this after hearing all the hype. Before, I avoided this book, guessing that it'd be depressing.<BR>It completely lacked emotional impact &amp; character development. Susie tells her story emotionally void. Every time I thought they were going to dig deeper into a character, it just sorts of fades away and doesn't happen. Such a tease. Did not live up to the hype.
B00005JL9B|5.0|It seems absurd to me that in a nation of gun fanaticism where kids seem to be blowing each other away left right and centre, and where sexual activity in films is for some reason considered more harmful to youngsters than extreme violence, that this film is not released. Obviously the reason for a delay (when the rest of the world has been happily watching this movie at home for over a year) is because no distributor wants to be used as a scapegoat for the USA's social problems the next time some lunatic opens fire on his classmates. <BR>But this film is not about violent exploitation of young people and it is certainly not about condoning such behavior. It is a film about people in an extreme situation and the lengths to which they will go to survive. Many people try to explain away the message that violence is a part of all people by suggesting the film is a peculiarly Japanese phenomenon. OPEN YOUR EYES!!!!<BR>If and when this film ever gets released in the States you should all check it out. You won't see a more daring film in a while.<BR>And if you think this is edgy material for a U.S. release, then check out the sequel in which the Tokyo Met. District is levelled WTC style and the hero of the film leads an al-Quaeda style terrorist group - the film actually even attacks the United States' aggressive military policy!!! Can't wait till that reaches the MPAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKN9|5.0|From the time of it's release, Gangs of New York was destined to be a critically underrated film.  And despite the fact it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one, losing in most categories to Chicago (Miramax's other big budget juggernaut).  However, deep within the film's flesh and bones, director Martin Scorsese has crafted a cinematic masterpiece with one of the finest cast's I've seen in a long time.  Leonardo DiCaprio, no matter what anyone might say or think about him, perfectly fits the part of Amsterdam Valon; who as a youth witnessed his gang leading father (Liam Neeson) get killed by the brutal Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting (an Oscar nominated Daniel Day-Lewis).  Years later, Amsterdam returns to New York and becomes a protege of Cutting's; while all the while keeping the memory of his father's demise.  Cameron Diaz is on board here as well as a pick pocket who catches Amsterdam's eye, and she does a much better job here than she has been given credit for.  Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas, and John C. Reilly are on board as well in smaller roles and give good performances, although it feels as if Reilly is a bit underused considering how good an actor he is.  Daniel Day-Lewis steals the entire film with his brutally convincing performance, which is his best in years.  Yes, Gangs of New York is a bloody and violent film, but nowhere near the excessive violence and gore of some past films which have been regarded as modern day classics.  All in all, Gangs of New York is an underrated modern day masterpiece that displays the film's marketing tagline: \\"America Was Born in the Streets\\".

B000002AVF|5.0|It's funny that the reviews of this CD are basically a couple of months apart.  There seems to be a strange resurgence of this cd.  Two weeks ago I found this CD among my collection and I haven't stopped playing it since.  It makes me appreciate Mariah so much.  It is incredible to hear her range and power in the ballads. Each song has such a fresh sound, that this album could be released tomorrow and do wonderfully.  Mariah might have changed her image a little since this album was released, but her talent and abilities cannot be denied.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest rock that ever lived. And this cd proves that these guys was and are the real deal. The music sounds great. Jimmy Page is a true talent and Robert Page knows how to blow the roof off of any building. Lets not forget the amazing John Paul Jones and the late John Bonham (who totally rocked). I highly suggest that you buy some old blues records to gain more respect for what Led Zeppelin did. Then you will see how and why Led Zeppelin won the west. They owe alot to the great blues artists, who paved the way for them.
1563890410|4.0|It is appropriate that Season of Mists opens with the first round-table meeting of the Endless, the title character's family who all rule over some \\"realm\\" of conscious experience. This story arch marks the point where Sandman went from being a super-smart horror series to a Middle Earth for the alternarock generation. No more would scary monsters and gruesome imagery be the defining features of Neil Gaiman's adult-orientated fantasy comic book. Instead ambiguously defined gods and semi-gods, such as the Endless, and their (mis)adventures in the modern world would be the driving force behind Sandman. This type of literature would become Gaiman's specialty and was probably always his primary interest. Likewise Season of Mists sees Gaiman write with greater ease and elegance than ever before, making this the best piece of the Sandman saga thus far.<br />In Season of Mists, Sandman AKA Dream AKA Morpheus, the series' main character and the member of the Endless who controls the realm of dreams, ventures into Hell to free a former lover he condemned there thousands of years ago. When he arrives, he finds Lucifer preparing to abandon his post, evicting all of the damned and demons and locking the gates. He gives the key to Hell to Morpheus. Afterwards, a horde of deities, from Anubis to Odin, storm Morpheus' realm, called \\"the Dreaming,\\" wanting to bargain for the key.<br />Gaiman's examination of the mythologies and religions of mankind is somehow admiring, thought-provoking and humorous at the same time. His use of characterization is marvelous and his sense of suspense is always second to none. Meanwhile, Mike Dringenberg, the artist of most the saga, creates marvels for the eyes with his portrayals of surreal settings such as Hell and the Dreaming. Although latter story archs would surpass it, Seasons of the Mist was a bold new step for Sandman and showed many of the traits that made it such a great series.

B000092ZYX|5.0|You have to have a certain level of intelligence to like this kind of music. I'ts about more than getting chicks or losing them, and its about more than being some one hit wonder pop punk group that only stays together long enough to make a few bucks. Radiohead tackles real life issues like war, politics, and life in general. If you dont like Radiohead, it's because you only listen to the radio, and you only like the songs on the top of the charts. You must not be used to a genuine sound, that has not been toyed with and over produced.
B00005OM4N|1.0|For anyone to give this album, anything higher than a star really doesn't know what good music is all about. Her last two albums were &quot;guilty pleasures&quot;. You knew they weren't good for your soul, but you still couldn't help liking it. However, this album is lacking something. For one thing, Britney can't sing worth a lick. She is a very limited singer and it comes through when she is not working with Max Martin, who made her vocals sound better than what they really are. Her tone is so irritating, that it's hard to enjoy the lyrics. Another point is she continues to rely on Max Martin. Personally, I think his sound helps her weak voice sound better, because his sound and background singers are so large. Her voice is not the main focus on Max's productions. When she works with Rodney and the Neptunes, their productions makes her vocals the main focus but she can't sing!! She also can't write...the little input that she had on the songwriting really shows she will NOT be around 10 years from now. On this album, she comes across, as not being real. I mean, she used alot of R&amp;B on this album because that style was popular at that time. But now she is going more into rock and techo on her next album because that style is in. *SIGH* Either way, this third album exposed her for what she is...now people need to wake up and start supporting REAL artists.
1563890119|4.0|Preludes and Nocturnes collects the first eight issues of Sandman, Neil Gaiman's acclaimed adult orientated comic book series about a morose mystic entity who controls the \\"realm of dreams.\\" In its earliest inception, Sandman was hardly the grand, Tolkien-ish neo-myth into which it would blossom. Instead, it was a smart, imaginative and genuinely scary horror series that obviously had the potential for greatness.<br />In Preludes and Nocturnes, the title character, also called Morpheus or Dream, is captured by a sorcerer and imprisoned for more than seventy years. After breaking free, he searches for tools that were taken from him by his captors: a helmet, a ruby and a pouch of sand, all of which were stolen and/or traded away long ago. During the quest, Morpheus encounters other DC characters such as supernatural con-man, John Castatine; the Justice League's resident escape artist, Scott Free and the demented, skull-faced villain, Dr. Destiny.<br />In these issues, Sandman is a horror series. Likewise, the standard issue is a single story (although each makes-up a part of an underlining storyline involving Morpheus' lost tools) that has some chilling ending awaiting one of its characters. While Gaiman's stories are rarely clich&eacute;d and always frightening (it is hard to imagine anything more frightening than issue six, in which Dr. Destiny uses Morpheus' ruby to force out the dark sides of an unsuspecting group of diner patrons), the prerequisites (gruesome imagery, bloody deaths, raving maniacs) sometimes seem forced. Similarly awkward is the inclusion of outside DC characters. The series is at its most haunting when it involves actual beliefs and myths of mankind. It gains a degree of campiness when characters like Scott Free are involved.<br />Despite these minor flaws, Preludes and Nocturnes has a lot of good things going for it. The art is remarkable; the stories are unpredictable and, as stated earlier, original and wholly frightening; and Gaiman shows amastery of characterization and the little details that bring it out. All in all, no one can say Sandman did not get off to a great start.
B000069HK2|4.0|I first heard of Finch back in March and thought that they were the greatest new band around.  The raw intensity and screaming vocals on 'What It Is To Burn' were so refreshing and kick butt that I thought no one could top.  Then a month later I heard The Used.  Ever since, I've only listened to them cuz they are just amazing and more kick butt than Finch (Finch is still an awesome band). 'Maybe Memories', 'Bulimic', 'Say Days Ago', and 'A Box Full Of Sharp Objects' are the most adrenaline pumping songs ever.  These 4 songs just give me so much energy and rage when I workout or run. 'The Taste Of Ink' and 'Buried Myself Alive' are also great songs, but the intensity is not up there with the other four. And 'Blue And Yellow' is an awesome mellow song. I would have given The Used 5 stars, but there are 1 or 2 songs that I usually skip, but I would recommend this CD to everyone. It is the best CD I have and I love their rage and anger. It's so kick butt.
0446310786|4.0|A wonderful book for young adults, full of moral wisdom and coming of age nostalgia. I actually enjoyed the first half exposition more, with its childhood cycle of school years and long hot summers filled with games and stratagems for luring out the mysterious Boo Radley. Of course, Atticus Finch shines as a timeless moral icon, and the tragedy of the Tom Robinson case was a lesson much needed during the early Civil Rights days. However, in purely literary terms, I thought the message came across as rather preachy and heavy-handed, especially in the false ingenuousness of some of the children's conversations on race and social justice. <BR>I'm in my 30's and somehow missed this book during my adolescence, nonetheless I can see why it has long been required reading for so many high schoolers.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is an amazing album. From begining to end, it's awesome. Mike's rapping couldn't be tighter and Chester's vocals and lyrics are flawless. This record is filled with 12 off-the-hook songs. All of which could be singles (yes, even \\"Sessions\\"). My personal favorite is \\"Lying From You\\". This song combines the genius collaboration of Mike and Chester to perfection. My only \\"complaint\\" is that the record is a little short, but that's quickly overlooked by excellent song writing and great production. Anyone who slams this record should never be allowed near a music store agian. I'd give this record a 10 if I could.
B00005JLSE|4.0|For many, they groan at the thought of a musical movie, thinking that all are alike. While there are many wonderful classics out there in this genre of broadway to big screen, chicago stands alone, with a fast paced race through the underside of the roarin 20's chicago nightlife, you cant ask for a more edge of your seat experince then this.<br />The music is intoxiating if even a little adultish at times, so dont let the kids see this one, the director keeps you drawn in with fast paced changes. he brings bob fosse's creation to life, with the somewhat artistic numbers to the emotional rollercoaster that we experince as we get sucked into the plot.<br />musical movies are not for everyone, everyone has there prefered style, should it be action, horror, comedy, each person will always have a diffrent opinion. If you enjoy the living entity that is musical theatre, then i highly recommend that you see Chicago.

Arnold is back as the Terminator to protect Connor and his wife to be.  At first I thought this series should of been concluded with \\"T2: Judgement Day\\", but now that I have seen this, I want to see more of this continuing saga.  From the looks of \\"T3\\" there probably will be another Terminator movie.  For me, \\"T2\\" is still the best out of the three, but this comes pretty close.  Well, enough said, go see this movie NOW!!!
B00004TJLD|4.0|The first book I ready by Isaac Asimov was \\"I Robot,\\" from whence the album got its name.  Glad I did.<br /><br />So, when the albmum came out in '77, I bought it without having heard of Alan Parsons or a note on the vinyl.  Then I bought it on CD.  Then the Mobile High Fidelity Half Speed Master vinyl pressing.  And now on the DVD -- which is almost impossible to find.  Glad I did.  R2D2 would be proud.  (Robot humor!)<br /><br />The music on the album is mainstream progressive, if there is such a thing.  Heavy on the synthesizers, less trebble than Supertramp, less complex than Emerson, Lake and Palmer or Yes, played by some of the best musicians around, superbly engineered and mostly accessible and enjoyable.  The first two thirds of the album contains some of the best rock from the late '70s.  However, the album seems to fall apart at the end.  On Nucleus, Total Eclipse and Genesis Ch. 1 v. 32, the Project goes off into some quasi-post 1900 classical, pre Steve Roach ambient filler which is supposed to create atmosphere.  It is not bad music, but it is in such discord with the rest of the concept album that it almost destroys it.  Luckily, the experimental stuff is lumped at the end of the album (the \\"B\\" side on the vinyl) and the rest is so good, that you can just ignore it, and feel happy with the purchase!<br /><br />Why buy the DVD?  It sounds better.  CDs always leave me fiddling with the trebble to fix what is an inherently fatigue inducing medium.  DVD-A and SACD with their higher sampling rate fix most of those problems.  And with the 5.1 track on most DVD-A and SACDs, you get even more data.  Unfortunately, here you get only two track stereo.  But what is here is very good, and significantly better than the CD.  I did an A/B comparison between the DVD and the audiophile Mobile High Fidelity vinyl pressing.  Usually, the DVD-A is better than the MoFi pressing.  Here, it's a toss up.  The MoFi version has a more interesting sound, a little fuller and witha brighter high end.  (It may be the Shure phono cartridge!)  At times, they are nearly indistinguishable.  On the other hand, the DVD may be more honest.  Either way, you are miles ahead of the CD.  Well worth the price.

B00005JLZN|1.0|SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.<br />I saw this one in the movie theaters.  I left the theater angry and frustrated.  Not because of the U.S. death penalty.  But because of this movie!  David Gale, who loves to give the middle finger to \\"the system\\", pulls the ultimate flip-off in this film.  The screenplay tries very hard to justify it, but I could not stomach the actions he takes.  In order to prove his point, Gale participates in a fake suicide -- morally reprehensible!  The writer tries to justify this (she was dying of cancer anyway, who cares if she decides to kill herself/sacrifice herself for a \\"just\\" cause??) but it doesn't float in my book.<br />The actions that our \\"hero\\" takes in this film undermine the argument against the death penalty!  It makes \\"liberals\\" appear desperate and a little nuts.  I wanted DAVID GALE to present an honest, good argument against the death penalty.  Instead, a mediocre \\"who done it\\" story is \\"hung\\" on the death penalty scenario.  The writer throws in some poorly placed arguments (usually as background dialogue; usually statistics) against the death penalty, but fails to win anyone over -- especially with the ENDING!!<br />So, I have BIG PROBLEMS with this movie.  Heroes don't \\"win\\" by pulling tricks like David Gale does.  Heroes win because they are right, stick to their guns -- and are supported by THE TRUTH.<br />I'd skip this film.  The ending will outrage you -- it did me.

068485743X|5.0|As a writer with a marketing background, the first aspect of this book that came to my attention was its title.  Simplistic and to the point, the pages inside are even better.  Because \\"The First Five Pages\\" doesn't tell you how to write a book, but what design elements will make it sell...<br />As a successful literary agent, Noah Lukeman is more than qualified to address the subject of salable manuscripts, and \\"The First Five Pages\\" should be required reading for every writer, both hobbyist and New York Times best-seller alike.  Lukeman's approach is far different from other books in the category because he never tells his reader how to write a great book, or even a good book.  Rather, his purpose is to provide a roadmap for \\"staying out the rejection pile\\".  And by following his guidelines for avoiding the \\"slush pile\\", writers will find that, as a result, their work improves.<br />Although much of what the book reveals can be found in other books, \\"The First Five Pages\\" puts important concepts into easy-to-read language.  And it hammers those concepts into your mind over and over again.  Lukeman explores the use of adjectives and adverbs, unnecessary words, commonplace dialogue, and the ever important \\"showing versus telling\\".  The book is broken down into nineteen chapters, each of which addresses a fundamental characteristic of the type of manuscript he, as an agent, is looking for.  Moreover, his emphasis on \\"the first five pages\\" drives home the concept that every word must be precise, in its proper place, and every sentence should be the best it can be.  If a reader isn't engaged by the fifth page, it doesn't matter how great the rest of your book is.  You must hook the reader, and keep them hooked, which means crafting each word so as to create the best possible manuscript.<br />It's this insight into the selection process of prospective agents that gives \\"The First Five Pages\\" its true value.  If Lukeman uses certain criteria to make a summary judgement of a manuscript, you can bet his peers do as well.  This book will help you figure out what those guidelines are, and how to adjust your manuscript with an eye toward impressing those agents.<br />I've read this book several times, and I recommend it to others.  This is a book all writers should buy and reread every few months.  It may seem elementary at first, but even Michael Jordan practices free-throws...  Writers also need to brush up on their fundamentals.<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of \\"Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller\\"f a manuscript, you can bet his peers do as well.

Self-delusion, sleep, fear... -R. seem to believe that these are prevalent in our societies, but, can we conquer our weaknesses and stop the &quot;loonies&quot; taking over?<br />A certain musical &quot;ambivalence&quot; makes it hard to please some fans. Neither electronica nor guitars fans have many reasons to believe that the band is fully with them this time. To me it is the same record as OK Computer, only a bit more thought over.

Some of the plot twists struck me as unnecessary -- there for their own sake, not smoothly weaving themselves into the story. The premise for the murders never quite made sense to me. Maybe I missed something? And listen, if I can figure out the encoded clues long before the Harvard symbologist and the professional cryptologist do, they're way too easy.<br />With that out of the way, I loved this book!! It's easily one of the most fascinating I've read. Despite its faults, I highly recommend it.<br />*After* you've read THE DA VINCI CODE, do yourself a favor and visit Dan Brown's website. 'Nuff said!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime in this historical saga!  His Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutter is one of the most amazing (and unsettling) performances I've ever seen in a movie.  As the nativist war lord of New York's Five Points area, he rules by subtle terror along with his brazenly brutal talent for throwing knives, cleavers and other implements of the butcher's trade.<br />\\"Gangs of New York\\" also serves as a showcase for the immense directing talents of Martin Scorsese as well.  With a wide range of directorial tools, he takes the viewer into a time capsule that puts them square into the squalor of what was New York's most violent and dangerous neighborhood.  It's not a journey for the meek, nor is it a vision for the tenderhearted.<br />The only things that might restrain this movie from becoming an all-time classic is the perilously understated job by Leonardo Dicapprio and a script that is long on self examination and short on explanation.<br />Leo plays the son of Irish gang leader Priest Vallon (brilliantly acted by Liam Neeson), who vows to avenge his father's death at the blade of Bill the Butcher.  Over the years, Bill's power base has expanded, leaving him as a valuable ally of Boss Tweed and his Tammany Hall organization.  But power and the prestige it can bring have not dulled the edge of a man who tutors his minions in his xenophobic hatred of the immigrants that are flooding into the city during the days of the Civil War.  Without knowing the background of young Amsterdam (Dicapprio), he takes the young man under his wing, teaching him the proper placement for a knife thrust as well as how to curry favor with the Tammany establishment.  As young Vallon plots his revenge he learns that of all the men vanquished by the Butcher, his own father, Priest Vallon, was the only man to earn Bill's respect.<br />Under the masterful hands of Scorsese, the movie builds to the climatic confrontation that coincides with the draft riots of that era.  It's not an especially satisfying conclusion, but again that's the result of a script that focusses too much on young Vallon without explaining some of the paradoxes that can jar the modern viewer.<br />With a level of diversity in today's society that exponentially exceeds that of the movie's era, it's difficult to understand the rancor between the second/third generation Americans (many of Irish descent) and the newly disbarked Irish settlers.  The differences between them seem trivial to modern sensibilities.  But those differences were real, and fostered 9/11-type intensity during a time of war and unrest -- the type of situation that often leads to the ascention of war lords such as Bill.<br />The cast is augmented by the able, but underused talents of Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed and John C. Reilly as a corrupt cop.  And Cameron Diaz provides some dirty faced sensuality to a role that might otherwise been left on the cutting room floor.  But throughout the story, the collaboration between Day-Lewis and Scorsese will have you riveted to the screen, fearing what might come next yet afraid to look away.It's not an especially satisfying conclusion, but again that's the result of a script that focusses too much on young Vallon without explaining some of the paradoxes that can jar the modern viewer.<br />With a level of diversity in today's society that exponentially exceeds that of the movie's era, it's difficult to understand the rancor between the second/third generation Americans (many of Irish descent) and the newly disbarked Irish settlers.

B000002U8G|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best Pink Floyd album.  It was the last album that was written for the shear joy of writing an album.  Most of the songs are upbeat and have nice cheery lyrics.  They don't seem to be about the bigger issues of life.  It has a distinct Floyd sound to it, but seems to be a group effort.<br />I hope that the SACD version of Dark Side of the Moon sold well, because this one should come out on SACD next.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I love this flick.  Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi, John Goodman, and John Turturro are just fantastic.  One laugh out loud moment after another.  One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  The Coen Brothers funniest work, in my opinion, followed by &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; and &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot;  Highly recommended.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is probably the quintesenstial Pink Floyd album.  It is also probably the reason why the band ended up breaking up.  It is heavily dominated by Roger Waters and is probably somewhat of an autobiography of his life as his life seems to mirror Pink's.   It is a very well written album.  The vocals and guitars are top notch.  Definately one of the top albums in rock.
0385504209|5.0|Factually flawless and thoroughly thought provoking, this book will make you think, make you question, and it might even make you angry. The research that went into this book was extensive. Brown then demonstrates the ability to present all the research in a mystery so full of intensity, interesting characters, and believabilty that you feel yourself scrutinizing everything you have been taught since you were born as you journey through the steps of the puzzle with the characters. Even Brown's detractors have to have learned something from this book. The material on Da Vinci alone was worth the read. To say this book brings into question much of current day religious doctrine is quite an understatement. The style however, allows the reader to believe or not believe the premise, while still enabling one to enjoy the mystery. I finished the book quite looking forward to the possibility of new revelations of a religious nature which may be earth-shattering or merely enlightening, but decidedly new and provocative. Archetypes, symbology, subliminal embeds, historical concepts and events out of the mainstream, and language clues make this book a challenge to one's intellect, yet it is such an enjoyable and easy read that the experience is genuinely delightful. (It was so good I postponed cracking open my new Harry Potter!)
B00007L4MJ|5.0|When I saw 'Metropolis' at the rental store and its boasting of being newly restored, I couldn't resist finally taking the film home.  I'd read about it dozens of times and knew vaguely what to expect, and I had even seen the anime film 'Metropolis' which was obviously inspired in no small part by this wondrous achievement in filmmaking.<br />I'm not knowledgeable enough in cinema history and technique to give this film a just review, but I will mention a few things that touched me on a very personal, mental level.<br />The theme of mediation between hand and heart is genuinely touching, and it reminded me of Hegel's notion of synthesis as well as his master/slave dialectic.  Not literally, of course, since in the film, the workers don't actually come to the conclusion that the results of their labor belong to them, and mediation is touted as being more desireable than conflict, but overall, I couldn't ignore the Hegelian implications the film depicted.<br />While reading 'Atlas Shrugged' by Ayn Rand, though she described (at length, I must lament) what her fictional world consisted of, I could never really visualize it in any meaningful way.  Well, 'Metropolis' has certainly shown me what Rand's ideal universe would be--a grand construct borne of a reigning ubermensch who lives on the backs, flesh, blood, and sweat of human cogs who are expected to gratefully &quot;contribute&quot; to the comfort and luxury of those more &quot;rational&quot; than they.  Fortunately, 'Metropolis' does not force us to choose sides in this tale, and it decidedly refrains from proselytizing to its audience.  We can completely sympathize with the workers and their plight, and their horrendous working conditions, their hapless melding with machine, is intolerable.  But at the same time we witness the efficiency and splendor of Metropolis, and Frederson doesn't seem to be an evil man.  It's obvious that he loves his son, and he can almost be seen as more of a workaholic and overachiever than anything else.<br />As others have mentioned, the film speed seems distorted in certain scenes, and I was unfortunately reminded of those humorous old &quot;cops and robbers&quot; chase scenes where everything is comically jerky and spastic.  Not the most dignified cinematic imagery to say the least, but I tried my best to overlook it.<br />The special effects, sets, costuming and score are wonderful, and I haven't seen many silent films, so I can't compare the acting in 'Metropolis' to the acting in other silents, but I thoroughly enjoyed the work of every actor in this film, especially that of the woman who played Maria.  Her Machine-Man was brilliantly creepy and diabolical, and I loved her facial expressions and body-language.  And in regards to the sets and art, I couldn't believe the complexity and vitality of Metropolis.  Countless incredible images can be found in this city, and even its macabre destruction was more the death of an organic entity than the mere crumbling of wire, steel, and asphalt.<br />There's no question in my mind why 'Metropolis' is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and it is such works of art as this that can so successfully evoke the tragedy of the human condition and then redeem it in one fell, glorious swoop.  There's no reason not to see this movie, period.
B00005B4GU|5.0|People have often criticized Radiohead's Kid A and Amnesiac albums as being a bit too spaced out and airy. But the truth of the matter is, Amnesiac is not only a continuation of Kid A but also the other half of Kid A. Both parts make a whole. Here's why. If you have two CD players, put both CDs in and start them at the same time. Radiohead purposely made the two CDs so taht you can play them together. Once you hear the combination of &quot;Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box&quot; and &quot;Everything in it's right place&quot; you will realize why both albums sound so airy. In fact, at some points of the mix, it almost seems as if there are two bands and Thom is talking to Thom. And suddenly the lyrics start making sense and everything falls into it's place. Obviously, making two CDs that sync up with each other is much harder than making two separate CDs, so I would say that they aren't as good as OK Computer or Hail to the Thief but the sheer musical innovation earns them a 5 star. So if you buy Amnesiac, do yourself a favor, buy Kid A too.
B000002L99|3.0|5150 continues into the direction of pop music which was initiated on 1984 and the life of this band continued to be sucked away.  There are moments which are energetic and fun, but a lot of this album feels too calculated and unnatural.<BR>To blame this entirely on the line-up change at the vocal spot would be wrong, although the cheddary-ness of Hagar's delivery does contribute.  A lot of people point at 1984 as the high point for Van Halen, however I disagree.  About half of 1984 was really top-notch, and the other half was frightening forays into cheesy synth-driven pop tunes aimed at getting more radio play.  It was forgivable in that context due to the glut of other quality material there, but it was the beginning of a decline of sorts for the group that likely would have continued with or without the line-up change on vocals.  I think I would chart the decline's bottom at OU812, and then the band's quality climbed on each of For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and Balance...only to be thrown completely off-course again by Van Halen 3 where the talents of Gary Cherone were almost completely wasted.<BR>Regardless of all this, even Van Halen at their worst is better than a lot of bands, and though 5150 is far from my favourite effort from this group, it does have its high points.<BR>All this being said, I think that \\"Dreams\\" is one of the cheesiest songs ever written in the history of music.  It sounds like some \\"victory song\\" that would play in the background of the end of one of those cheesy 80's movies where the main character defeats his arch-rival at some sporting event, is frozen in celebration while kissing the girl or punching his fist in the sky, and the ending credits fade in.
B00007AJF9|5.0|from warm sweet girl to ice queen. Cate Blanchette was superb.I really enjoyed everything about this movie, but Cate Blanchette absolutely deserves to be crowned for her excellent performance.She seamlessly carries you thru her evolution with heart and grace.
B000021YQV|5.0|System Of A Down continues to deliver hard-hitting, meaningful metal music.  This CD is my personal favorite of theirs.<br />1.  Prison Song (9/10) A great opening song.  Very striking polital views are present amungst hard-hitting music.<br />2.  Needles (8/10) Awesome song with both hard and soft portions.  Great vocals, too.<br />3.  Deer Dance (9/10) Very meaningful and chilling lyrics mixed in with the usual great background music.<br />4.  Jet Pilot (8/10) Lots of energy in this song.  I also like the transition of vocal styles present.<br />5.  X (9/10) I like the instrumentals in this song the most out of any other.  Very energy-filled vocals, too.  I love the growls.<br />6.  Chop Suey! (10/10)  This is my favorite song.  Not only S.O.A.D., this is my favorite song out of any song I have ever heard.  I absolutley love the transitions from quick-talking loud vocals to a melodic, well-sung chorus.  The guitars are awesome, and the vocals are better.<br />7.  Bounce (9/10)  Great guitar work and humerous lyrics.<br />8.  Forest (9/10)  I like the vocals in this song a lot, both stylistically, and in regards to the message presented.  The guitar is great, too, just like all the other songs on this CD!<br />9.  Atwa (10/10)  This is my second-favorite S.O.A.D. song behind Chop Suey!  The vocals are awesome.  It is nice and soft with still the touch of heavy-hitting instrumental work.<br />10.  Science (8/10)  Good song, a bit repetative near the end.<br />11.  Shimmy (8/10)  Another good song.  A couple cool growls.<br />12.  Toxicity (10/10)  One of S.O.A.D.'s best.  The title track of the CD, and well-deserved.<br />13.  Psycho (9/10)  Very cool, effective repeats.<br />14.  Aerials (10/10)  Another one of S.O.A.D.'s best.  They combine their usual hard-hitting instrumental style with melodic vocals.  It has a good message, as well.  Very reminiscent of Atwa.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I decided to wait a few weeks before writing this review because this kind of music takes some time to settle in. What Radiohead has done with this album is staggering. As interesting as Kid A and Amnesiac were, I felt the minimalism to be a bit overwhealming. Each track on this album has its own unique musical flavor, while the unifying theme of fear and doubt in a GWB-lead world connects them with haunting grace. If you have a brain and ears, you owe it to yourself to attempt understanding this immense work. While some may write this comment off as pandering to the Rolling Stone writers of the world, I personally believe this to be a modern Masterpiece.

0786867973|4.0|Though the recipes can be quite English (steamed puddings and the like), there are several that I can't wait to try. Most are a bit fancier than the predictable cookies, bars, and cakes in similar cookbooks. Not a whole lot more effort, though, and in most cases she encourages shortcuts. Very entertaining and a lovely cookbook all around.
B000002MG1|5.0|I became a fan of R.E.M. in the Out of Time era. A year later, bored on the popularity of Losing My Religion, I bought Automatic for the People.<BR>I was marvelled.<BR>Undoubtebly the masterpiece of R.E.M.'s excellent work (until now, that is) the record is brilliant, in all aspects: production (excellent string arrangements), music, lyrics, voice, instruments... the works.<br />Now that it is possible to look back and analyse the best works of the last decade, I would certainly place this on the &quot;Best records of the 90's&quot; list.<br />Another writer compares this to &quot;Ok Computer&quot;... I would say it does, in some aspects: both have excellent production, both are the product of amazing, tight, professional and on-peak-form bands... However, musically speaking, I tend to compare it with another brilliant Radiohead album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (in my opinion, as good - ie, brilliant - as &quot;Ok Computer&quot;).<br />Being a portuguese, and currently working in Porto Alegre - Brazil, I went this weekend to a local record store... from the hundreds of cds there, I bought Automatic for the People. I do have another in Portugal... but I just had to listen to NightSwimming, Find the River, Sweetness follows, New Orleans...<br />Sad, though not depressing, this is the best companion for sunny, yet chilly afternoons.
B00009V7P8|5.0|From the moment you hear the languid cries of Damien and Lisa, you'll be hooked. I was. This might be one of the more influential albums to hit the streets in decades. Think Leonard Cohen. Think Miles Davis (for influence, not style). Think grammy speech, Damo. You're gonna be a big winner.
B00009TB5G|2.0|With all that could have been great about The Two Towers, it's funny that one of the book's \\"villains\\" saves the film. The scenes involving Gollum (interacting with Frodo and Sam) are the only ones that really shine and remain true to Tolkien's characterization. I would buy the DVD just for these scenes.<BR>The other plot points are so dumbed-down as to be Harry Potter-esque. Faramir turns out to be little better than his brother, Theoden's fall from greatness is changed from being a product of subtle mind-control and human despair to a simple wizard's spell, Gimli is transformed from a Dwarf to be reckoned with to an utter buffoon, and Aragorn seems to go through the motions of a lead character (complete with \\"suspenseful\\" dive off a cliff). I'm not saying the film should be an exact copy of the books. There's no practical way to do that. But certain basics of character and plot could be faithfully preserved without hopelessly confusing the average movie-goer (and i won't even get started with the HORROR of what Jackson did with Arwen). I can only hope The Return of the King is better. Please!!
0553277472|1.0|I finished the entire book to know the complete nightmare that the author put his son through.  I read it recently with a author's postscript.  He is just a creep and kind of scary and his &quot;philosophy&quot; is completely illogical.  I just about cried for his poor son.
B000099T2L|4.0|Dangerously in Love is a Smash debut from Beyonce.  Its goes where it needs to go.  Beyonce starts of with four fresh club hopping joints initially with 'Crazy In Love'. The song is truly and standout from the Cd and from every thing else out on the radio \\"right now\\".  'Naughty Girl' is an eclectic mix of grooves fit to make a sensual sexy song for ladies to sing on the dance floor.  'Be With You' is a great riding joint where  Beyonce uses her keen sulrty vocals in the most clever way on the track also like so with 'signs', Beyonce exhibits much control and finese that makes you listen again and again.  This CD is not what you expected, its not Destiny's Child, its Beyonce, and its hot as hell.  Its slow its fast, its sad, its happy, its a complete cd.  At 21, to be this good, is great.  Beyonce still has room to grow, but this cd  really shows the persistent growth of some one on their way to being a legend.<BR>She is a truly talented artist hype or no hype.
B000089RVX|5.0|Really great music.  They have the hand rock/goth rock music (examples: Going Under and Tourniquet) and then they have soft rock music (example: My Immortal).  I was really surprised when I heard their cd.  Amy Lee has a unique voice she can hit all ranges from high to low.  The band is smashing also.  Great buy- check it out.
B000002UB3|5.0|Don't know if Abbey Road is the best Beatles album, as it is often called, but it certainly was proof that, at the end of their career together, they still had &quot;it&quot;: the ability to write and perform insanely catchy tunes; the desire to present them in experimental ways (in this case, framing most of their work in the latter half of the album in a medley format that defied easy radio play).

B000002UAX|5.0|Perhaps the most ecclectic of the Beatles' albums, the (named by default) White Album showcases the different directions that the band's members were headed in their later careers, from bluesy electric-rock to oom-pa-pa ballads, with nary a false note. Slower and looser than many of their earlier pop albums, it has the feel of a weekend session at which any idea was acceptable.
B000069HP6|4.0|A Disney film plunging the viewer into the searing galactic equivalent of Dante's inferno? &quot;The Black Hole&quot; is as chillingy infinite as the title implies. Buck Rogers and Metaphysics. What are Reinhardt and Maximillian but fevered incarnations of Victor Frankstein and his Creature, spinning through eternity in the morally-vacant reaches of space, arousing man's searching lust for conquest, the dark side of Captain Kirk, with Norman Bates along for the ride. A haunting paen to the beyond.

B00003CXSM|4.0|This movie is a perfect vehicle for Jennifer Lopez.  Her acting style and personality fit well with the character, and makes the whole movie work.<br />Jennifer plays Mary Fiore, an intelligent and very good wedding planner.  We see multiple examples of Mary's ability to organize and plan for complex weddings, from the biggest and most complex activity down to the minutest detail.  Mary always has a contingency for every situation.<br />Because of Mary's position, and how the weddings she plans always happen so successfully, Mary is envied by many.  However, the truth is that Mary's personal life is dull.  As Mary says, \\"Those who can't do, teach.  Those who can't wed, plan.\\"  Another old saying also appropriate is, \\"Always a bridesmaid and never a bride,\\" with the substitution of wedding planner.<br />Into Mary's life comes Dr. Steven Edison (Matthew McConaughey).  Through one of those bizarre coincidences that generally happen only in the movies, Dr. Steve saves Mary from a runaway dumpster hit by a cabbie who was trying to retrieve ice cream that had fallen from a cone.  It takes Mary some time to discover that the guy that has saved her life and to whom she is attracted is going to be the groom for the biggest wedding she has ever planned.  The rest of the movie involves maneuvering between Dr. Steve, Mary, and Fan Donolly (Bridgette Wilson), Dr. Steve's future bride, until we reach the rather unlikely, somewhat humorous, and moderately predictable end of the movie.<br />This movie is less than perfect.  All the characters treat each other too nicely, even when they are being \\"mean.\\"  Everything works out a little too nicely, even given all the coincidences.  Ultimately the movie is a romantic fantasy, with a fair amount of humor that works.  Of course, the movie is intended to be a sort of Cinderella story, though Cinderella in this case is pretty and intelligent, and knows how to handle herself in the business world.  While some may complain the movie is trite, it does work, it does make you feel good, and I enjoyed the movie well enough to smile at the ending and to want to watch it a second time., it does work, it does make you feel good, and I enjoyed the movie well enough to smile at the ending and to want to watch it a second time.
B00002599I|4.0|i remember back in 1990 waiting for the release of this album with great anticipation.sabbath's previous two releases headless cross and eternal  idol were excellent cd's and very underrated,even classics at least in my opinion.but tyr just don't stand up to these two albums.tony martin's vocals are'nt as strong as with headless cross and eternal idol.the great tony iommi also doe'nt sound as strong as he usually does.there's really not any very bad tracks on this album but there's only a few great ones on it either.the truly standout tracks on this album for me were anno mundi,jerusalem,sabbath stones and heaven in black.the rest i would consider average.this is still a very good album just nothing great.
B00004VXF2|2.0|People often say that this album was Reed's middle finger to his record lable and the public who worshipped him as the \\"Rock N Roll Animal\\", but that wasn't the case. I had a chance to meet Lou Reed in person at a UCLA book festival while he was promoting \\"The Raven\\". He had a Q&A session, so I knew it was my one and only chance to ask him about \\"Metal Machine Music\\". The first question I asked him was \\"what inspired it, and what was it's purpose\\". He told me that at the time he was listening to a lot of 70's Krautrock and Avant Grade music (he went on a lot about John Cage) and he wanted to do something similar. Perhaps this is his interpretation of that, but whatever his intentions were, it wasn't a total joke.    Reed clearly loves noise. Every album he has released has had some form of noise in it, it's just in a different disguise each time. \\"Ocean\\" from \\"Lou Reed\\", \\"New York Conversation\\" from \\"Transformer\\", the opening intro from \\"Berlin\\" (don't forget the crying Kids as well). I can name one song from each album, there's just no escape from Reed's obsession with the bizarre. If you think \\"Metal Machine Music\\" was a joke, you clearly don't understand Mr. Reed or have made it through the second side of VU's \\"White Light/White Heat\\"    Now, I'm not going to praise \\"Metal Machine Music\\" as an art form or statement. In fact, I find it do be downright ugly, but I enjoy it. No, it isn't music, and yes, it's an hour of pure noise. You can't really love it and you can't really hate it. It's just there. When I listen to it, I put it on as background noise, or I use it to drown out those annoying birds in the morning.    Reed told me that he didn't make this album with serious or artistic intentions. He loves noise and this is his tribute to it. Consider this his break from being the \\"Rock N Roll Animal\\". After \\"Sally Can't Dance\\", he wasn't sure which direction he should take, so this was a break from the pressures of stardom and a chance to have some fun. However, most people don't understand Reed's idea of \\"fun\\", so this album will forever be hated or praised as art. I even had a chance to ask him about \\"Fire Music\\" from \\"The Raven\\". He told me that he witnessed the 911 disaster in New York from his apartment window. \\"Fire Music\\" was a result of that. It was something he created to take his mind off reality and have a fun, yet cathartic experience.    Well, I better wrap this up now. Yes, I only gave \\"Metal Machine Music\\" two stars. The reason for that is simple, it is noise that only a few people can handle. While Reed may have had fun creating it, listening to it is not the same. But I have found ways to use it, mostly to torture people and drown out other unwanted noise, so it deserves some recognition.
B000002JS8|5.0|this is easily ac/dc 's  greatist album and in fact one of the greatist albums of all time,from a rating of 1 to 10 i give everysong  on this album a 10, except for get it hot which is also a great song but not a classic like the rest,i give this one a 7.it's hard to pick out the best songs on this album cause really thier all great,but i really love highway to hell,love hungry man,girls got rythym and touch to much.i'm not even really a huge ac/dc fan but this album is unbelievably great.if you don't have it already ,then take my word on it ,get it.
1577311523|5.0|I really loved this book.  It was profound and far reaching in its impact.  I could feel Eckharts words resonating within me as I read.  The only issue I had, was that while these are all really nice thoughts and concepts, finding a way to apply them in my real, everyday life was very challenging.  Then I found the book PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS by Shannon Duncan, which is published by the same publisher as The Power of Now.  Present Moment Awareness was full of very practical and real world exercises and examples that have made it much easier for me to apply what Eckhart is describing.  My humble opinion is that these two books really belong together.
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing the video for &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and I feel in love with the band. It's music by real musicians for a change!! Adam Levine has a wonderful voice, by the way. It's a great buy, I'm glad I bought it. ^_^

Let's face it the first {TERMINATOR} was a surprise sleeper hit, in Terminator 2 it was what we had waited 10 years for and BOY did it deliver with Robert Patrick in the best machine portrayal I've ever seen... menacing, cold and the special effects were TOP NOTCH that year... some of you may remember it won a Oscar that year for Special Effects.<br />So low and behold we wait another decade or so for this installment.. my hopes were high and eager to see Arnold and John do some Kick butt action. The fact that Sarah a/k/a Linda Hamilton had so many scenes (in the first 2)where she participated in the fight and gun scenes made the movie even more EXCITING for me, I just thought they would deliver. In this one you see one long vehicle chase scene in the beginning that ate up about 20 minutes (or at least that is what it felt like) of screen time, a fight scene between the 2 Terminators near the end that was pretty intense but still not what you got with the first 2 movies :( and Oh yea.... the plot (or lack thereof)<br />I agree with what another reviewer said, if you are new to this franchise you'll probably LOVE it, or if you are young and didn't see the first 2 when they were originally released (ie; before the computer generated era) you won't mind the things that I just mentioned. I gave it 1 star for the Action.... the 2nd Star for Clair Danes (she was very good) and the 3rd star for actually 2 things... Arnold's one line that made him famous (with the exclusion of any from Conan) \\"I'LL BE BACK\\" in the case of this movie....\\"SHE'LL BE BACK\\" and second they got the end right.<br />I really felt like John should have been in more scenes where he had more Action (other than just running)- I don't know maybe when the DVD comes out we'll find them in the \\"deleted scenes\\" feature. I would have expected any child of Sarah Conner to have more toughness (with guns and physically) about him...second they got the end right.<br />I really felt like John should have been in more scenes where he had more Action (other than just running)- I don't know maybe when the DVD comes out we'll find them in the \\"deleted scenes\\" feature.

0385504209|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I thought the author tied a lot of the Grail Lore in very nicely.  I found a lot of the DaVinci information new &amp; refreshing &amp; came back to a lot of the stuff that I knew about the Templars, early Catholic Church &amp; the Gnostic Gospels.
B000002N3N|5.0|I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album.
B000002UC5|4.0|McCartney's first solo album (released before Let It Be) was as simple as a Beatle can get. This could be seen as clumsy or unfinished, but I think that Paul wanted the album to sound this way purposely. Almost like a vacation from perfection, Paul sings songs of love and happiness using the elemental rock instruments without using many studio effects. <br />Some songs are slightly annoying and repetitive, but overall this recording leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Songs like &quot;Every Night&quot; and &quot;Momma Miss America&quot; are great fun while &quot;Junk&quot; and &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; stand out as some of Sir Paul's greatest melodies of his career. A must have for true Beatles fans (especially those who are fond of Paul). <br />However, of the 3 post-Beatles albums released in 1970: this, Plastic Ono Band, and All Things Must Pass.... The latter is the only one to come close to the magic that the fab four once had.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This album has so many wonderful moments. And just hearing new music from Stevie and Lindsey together is cause for joy. The amazing Red Rover is the standout track for my ears. I also love Bleed To Love Her but prefer the live version. Stevie has said there are too many tracks to allow people to focus on 2 or 3 standout tracks. While listening to all 18 tracks may cause sensory overload, I say better too many than too few. Stevie did write half the songs and I think having just one female voice provides a better balanced album. Christine produced some lovely songs on previous albums but more often than not she was just a bit too Pop.<BR>As Lindsey has said, this is a new sound for Fleetwood Mac which for me is usually quite exciting. But it's just familiar enough not to ignore the old fans. This is a great guitar album and a great song album. It's just sad that the equally provocative and accessible 'Time' album from 95 with Dave Mason and Bekka Bramlett couldn't have garnered the equal amounts of attention and acclaim that it truly deserved.
0688163173|4.0|I was pleased to read a really good book and not be disappointed by Dennis.  However, I'm following all the clues and thinking I know what's going on and voilla!!!!  What happened and who do I know that read it and can confirm it???  I guess I shouldn't have believed everything I read according to the last page.<br />Good read - enjoy!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is marvelous music making. It truly shows that, given the visual inspiration, a soundtrack can rise to the level of all but the greatest symphonies and operas. Shore is no Wagner or Vaughan Williams, but surely he's reached the level of a Rachmaninoff or Sibelius. Call it a soundtrack or call it a suite of themes inspired by Tolkien/Jackson, this is a classic.<BR>As marvelous as Enya's songs are on this album, The Return of the King has two fantastic opportunities for her during its final chapters. I hope Shore/Jackson avail themselves of her talents again. They certainly couldn't do better otherwise.

B0000035E7|5.0|Yep,that´s right,Bleach is Nirvana´s best album!Not Nevermind,not In Utero,not MTV Unplugged In New York,not From The Muddy Banks Of Wishkah and not Incesticide but Bleach!Although this cd was recorded per 600$ in a garage,that doesn´t change the fact that kicks [booty]!All the songs are great,being Blew,School,Negative Creep,Scoff,Sifting,Downer,Love Buzz, Swap Meet and Big Cheese my favorites!The only song i don´t truly worship is Mr.Moustache,and it´s still a pretty good song!My advice:-If you have In Utero and Nevermind,get this,but don´t expect Bleach to be like those two,there are a lot of screeches!<BR>-The recording quality is mediocre,but that can be expected considering that was recorded in a garage(Although it´s Much better than the recording on Muddy Banks)!<BR>-Just like In Utero and Incesticide,this album takes a while to get into and will be somewhat of a difficult listen!<BR>-Fans of Dave Grohl will not like this cd much,because,Grohl isn´t on the drummings,but Chad Channing is,and,sadly,Chad cannot compare Dave Grohl,so,be carefull with that too when you buy the cd! I´ll admit it that the first time i bought this album,i hated it more than anything in the world and i wanted to throw it away quickly,yes,you heard me!But then...it became my favorite... weird,very,very weird!
0783222955|5.0|This movie is about accepting others differences and being happy about your own. It would be wonderful if Atticus was everyone's Father alas that is not the case. The movie is poignant and thrilling and sad. I remember watching it as a child and the rabid dog scene was so profoundly compelling but now it is really nothing at all. Great movie to watch at least once a year and explain to your kids.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Nothing special, just a funny movie that makes you laugh.  Some people might not like it as much as others, but there's a few scenes, no matter who you are, you'll laugh out loud.  Worth a watch for sure, and I personally think it's worth buying.
B000065V1V|5.0|There is no Words To express How Much I love David Bowie. This album Proves How brillant he Really is. After 30+ years doing music,movies,dance,Theater,etc.. He is a True artist at every since of the the word. He has so much Talent...So Incredably Orginal, and So Amazing. His music has been alwyas Ahead of It;s time and always Great. After so many years in the Music Industry...He comes Back at 56 years Old... And Creates a Truely Amazing album. He is a man That truely has Talent. You have to be Crazy not to be a Bowie FaN. This album and so many others prove that! Get it!
B00005JM09|5.0|I expected this movie to suck.  Truth is, I saw it 3 times in 4 days because I was so pleasantly surprised.  Arnold beefed up to near-T1 standards, John and Kate did well, and Loken was terrific.  Arnold's humor was delicious, absolutely fabulous.  The action scenes held together well.<br />But for me, the best part was the ending.  I was *not* expecting that.  A lot of the respect I have for this film is in its daring to write an unpopular ending that fit so well.  I love watching this movie; when I leave the theater, I am always thankful for my petty little life with its petty little problems.<br />Naysayers, get off your drugs, your high horses, and get your heads examined.  This was the little big-budget movie that could.  It defied all expectations of suck-dom and was actually GOOD.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I orignially rented this movie because there are spoofs of it everywhere and I wanted to understand what they were making fun of. This movie has completely changed my opinions on Susan Surandon (sp?) Barry Bostwick (sp?) and Tim Curry. I like them even more. They display talents that I did not even know they had. I have rented it everyweek for the last month. It is an amazing piece of film and I would love to br part of a movie like that.
B00008X5J3|5.0|I am an AVID musical lover and enjoy attending Broadway shows whenever possible. In May 2002, a full eight months before the film came to theatres, I saw \\"Chicago\\" on Broadway. It was, in a word, incredible. When I learned it was being made in a movie, I was very happy and spent many months anxiously anticipating its arrival. In January 2003, after seeing the film, I was even more astonished. Catherine Zeta-Jones, in the opening \\"All That Jazz\\", is simply stunning. I was equally impressed with Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger, but Zeta-Jones is truly incredible with her interpretation of Velma. But what surprised me most about all these actors is how well they became their characters. Their acting, singing, and dancing, is truly what musicals are. This film is Broadway on a movie reel, and it is not to be missed. Yes, the movie is about killing, and murder, and fame, and how it all goes to your head, but that is the point of the movie. It is a sort of satire of how murder and greed can make a person so popular and wanted that the crimes go unnoticed. THAT is the essence of \\"Chicago\\". It does not support murder; it helps to show audiences that fame sometimes can make us forget what really happened. If you are a musical fan, buy this movie. It is utterly fabulous. However, if you just view its surface, you will not understand the depth the actors have incorporated to the characters. I challenge you to watch and find the inner meaning to \\"Chicago\\". I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
B000099T2L|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  if you get this CD you won't be disappointed.  There is no bad songs on this CD.  would recommend it to anyone.  hope you enjoy it.  thanks for reading my review.

B00005JM09|5.0|This movie has nothing but action!!!! 12 years of waiting for a third sequel payed off. John Connor, now 22, is supposed to stop Judgement Day. Judgement Day wasn't stopped, just postponed. The new T1 (Arnold Schwarzenneger) is programmed to protect Connor. Also a new sexier Terminator, the TX, is programmed to destroy Connor. So now Connor and the T1 have to destroy the TX before it destroys them. Then Connor has to survive a nuclear attack to then stop Judgement Day and become the savior of mankind. With the great plot and action of the movie, \\"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines\\" is a definite success. This is the best one of the whole sequel. In 12 years, 2015, a fourth sequel to the movie will be made. This movie is good for anyone. Adults will enjoy this movie, and kids and teens will definitely enjoy it!!!

B00006J9OV|3.0|Unconvincing acting from Jerusalem and Weikl, insufficient seductive beauty from the Flower Maidens, ridiculous coughing from the audience and the &quot;End of Act II Fiasco&quot; as already mentioned by another reviewer are only some of the problems with this production.<br />But above all else, the staging is a bore.  Couldn't Parsifal be done as a film instead of these cheesey sets?<br />Thus, we are left with Wagner's glorious music and not much else.<br />Still enjoy Kurt Moll's voice though so 3 stars.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love Lord of the Rings and it'a an amazing film with great actors! It's one of the most amazing film and expensive and it's really worth your time watching it!
B00006V9A0|4.0|This greatest hits packages is a great place to start on Nirvana.

B00005NGAL|5.0|I am 77 years old.  My beloved late wife and I were avid live theater patrons, both in GB and the USA.  My wife and I were lucky to have seen our first \\"Cats\\" performance in London the first month it opened.  Several years later we again revisited London and saw \\"Cats\\" again.  Both times it was a remarkable theatrical experience.  I just received my \\"Cats (COMMEMORATIVE)\\" DVD and it is the very best version of \\"Cats\\" I have ever seen.  The extra bonus DVD that comes with the \\"Unlimited Edition,\\" explaining in minute detail, how the play \\"Cats\\" was conceived and its production, is truly worth the price of DVD alone.

B00006JIA4|4.0|This compilation will provide casual fans with the most popular Queen songs in the band's catalog. The packaging and booklet are good and informative with photos relevant to each time period and song. The first two discs have basically every hit known in the US and Europe. In my opinion Disc III is just a filler as it has just a few &quot;hits&quot;. Most of this Disc III is just stuff thrown in to create a marketeable product. This does not mean that is a bad CD but it is no greatest hits as is stated.
B00008MNYS|5.0|HI Im from Germany and here Robbie is a MEGA-star! My favourite songs are: Angels + Let me entertain you (Life thru a lens), Rock DJ + Kids (Sing when you`re winning), Feel + Come undone + Something beautiful (Escapology)! I can just tell you that his songs are great and he is one of the biggest entertainer alive. I also like &quot;harder&quot; music like Eminem or Linkin Park, but Robbie made his own thing and this is really really good!
B000089RVX|4.0|This first release fron Evanescence shows a band yet in the making. This bands sounds remaninds me of a few progressive metal bands but with nu metal qualities and Goth like sounds. This is in no sense a put down on the band, on the contrary is great to hear new mainstream music with such a powerful performance. On this recording tha bands sounds relies on the powerful and opera like voice on their female singer (Amy Lee) and the heavy distorted guitar sond of Ben Moody.<br />By looking at the booklet I get the impression that Evanenescence is really a duo and not yet a full band as Lee And Moody take credits for performing, writting and producing the album. It will be very interesting to see where this band will go on their next recording
B00006879E|4.0|I just bought this CD 2 weeks ago and I have to say that the thought out lyrics and rhythm is like nothing else. Shares alot of simularities with John Mayer with his lyrics, However his melody is like no other band I have heard. In my opinion if you listen to Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer, Jack Johnson and/or Ben Harper than Maroon 5 is for you. <br />His single Harder to Breath has been spun a bit more than I like however She will be Loved, Must get Out, Sunday Morning &lt;-- My Fav and Secret are all amazing. Give it a try and it will be a excellent addition to your music collection...<br />Hope you Enjoy!
B00008OWZC|5.0|There is not much to say here. Is led Zeppelin at their best: Live and Focused. <br />The sound quality is very good, the song selection is adecuate and the performance is top notch.<br />You wanted Zep live, well this recording and the BBC CD should be enough to provide you with a very complete picture of the band live.
B00005JM09|3.0|This is not as good as the previous two, certainly not as good as Terminator 2, but is worth seeing for Terminator fans. Early on, there is a lot of spillover from the previous film and from \\"The Matrix\\". It looks like it will be another boring sequel, but turns out to be okay. I would have given two stars for the far-fetched explosions and probably one star for the incorrect display of fuel cells (they do not become nuclear weapons). The rest is good for factual filler (e.g., how SkyNet develops). Unfortunately, the final sequence leaves no doubt that there will be a Terminator 4.
B00008NRI8|3.0|Proves that even the most charming actors and the wittiest dialogue can't rescue a cliche-ridden story. He is about as believable as an executive as she is as a high-powered lawyer. And the pivitol issue of &quot;saving the Community Center&quot; is about as un-original as possible. It's pleasant enough, but takes no chances and achieves nothing noteworthy.
0066214122|2.0|Michael Crichton again writes cautionary tale about Tech (Nano-bots instead of Dinos this time) pushed too far.  Predictably it lashes out and must be thwarted by the protagonist.  He is writing same old plotline with the same stock cardboard characters.   Still he places just enough background and science information to make it passable until the last half of the book.  Then he jumps over the line of willing suspension of disbelief and is then relegated to silliness.  This same book written with a more subtle hand could have been chilling.  He makes nano-bots into a large visible menace. My only thought is he was trying to write the book to be a movie.  It might be a great visual but it ruined the book.
B00005JMFR|5.0|People keep speculating over Neo's power in the real world, demonstrated at the end of Reloaded.  They keep pushing theories about a matrix in a matrix, and other ideas that are very zen.<br />However, I think Agent Smith answered this question in the first Matrix.  \\"It's evolution, Morpheus.  Like the dinosaur.\\"  Only this time, the machines are the dinosaurs.<br />My guess is that the Wachowski's are going to use the idea of human evolution for an explanation.  After all, humans supposedly only use 10 percent of their brains.  Perhaps Neo's experience in the Matrix has unlocked the untapped power in the rest of his brain.  <br />The first movie explained how much electricity the human body generates.  Maybe Neo has found a way to emit an electromagnetic pulse.  In any case, I'm looking forward to seeing if they give an answer in Revolutions, or if they leave it to the viewer to decide.
B00005JL96|5.0|Disney triumps with Lilo and Stitch, a very adorable and enduring tale of this little creature from out of space. Watching this movie almost made me wish that Stitch was real so I could cuddle him.  <br />I have seen this movie probably 30 times and never tire of seeing it again.  Keep up the good work Disney.  I hope that the next Stitch movie is as good as this one.
1881273156|5.0|I consider this book one of the must read books for anyone in a relation (that means everyone).  I rank this book up with John Gray's Mars &amp; Venus book.  The concept is simple:  People express their love differently.  If you're not expressing your love for your spouse in the way they like, your efforts will not be as effective as they could be.  For example, if I buy my wife gifts all the time but to her love is expressed by spending lots of quality time together, then my gifts aren't going to make her happy.  By focussing my efforts on what makes her happy (quality time in my example), my effort will be much more effective.  Dr. Chapman states that people usually show love in the way they like to receive it.  While that's not necessarily the way your spouse likes to receive it.  Kind of like when we buy someone a gift we often buy something we like instead of what they like.  It's a very simple concept but learning it completely can lead to very powerful results.<br />I especially like how Dr. Chapman gives specific examples from his counseling experiences.  To me, specific examples are what really drives a point home.<br />Dr. Chapman does mention principles and teachings from the bible several times, but honestly I don't think that would turn anyone off if they're not a Christian.<br />Finally as someone else pointed out, it is funny how he mentions his own name every change he gets.  Funny yes.  Annoying just a little.  Effect, definitely.  You won't forget his name after reading this book!<br />Overall I highly recommend it, especially if both couples in a relationship can read it together.
B000099T2L|3.0|It falls flat half way through the album. I am not hating, because i do like Beyonce, but i was looking for more from this album and i didn't get it. Her ballads aren't as strong or powerful as i was hoping for, i do give her alot of credit for writing her own music, something extremely hard to do. She is not up to par as the likes of Whitney or Mariah, but i think Beyonce will be around awhile so hopefully in time she will improve. It's worth checking out.
0066214122|2.0|\\"Prey\\" has some interesting things to say about the subject of artificial intelligence and nanotechnologies. Unfortunately, Crichton has decided to do his story telling inside a made for Hollywood screenplay rather than a serious novel dealing with serious issues such as the fate of humanity and the life threat that science poses to us.<br />There was a point about three quarters though this screenplay where I got angry and found myself almost talking to the book as I began to think back to what had occurred as what I found myself reading did not in any way jive with what had come before. <br />Crichton does explain these things at the end, but by then I no longer cared enough to think through whether his explanation was really valid or not. By then I was angry that what had attempted to be a serious examination of the cross currents of profit incentives and science producing the end of the world had instead mutated into a Hollywood blockbuster starring computer programmer Brad Pitt who sees that he no longer loves his wife and bonds with Chinese-American virologist Lucy Lieu and defeats the now highly evolved and absolutely unstoppable (in the real world) \\"swarm\\", which suddenly begins to make one stupid move after the other during much action that leads to the clichéd big fiery explosion that vaporizes the danger forever and leaves us all safe from harm.<br />Even Jack-the-programmer's kids survive after much vomiting even though by the rules laid down in this screenplay/novel they had no hope.<br />How concerned do we need to be if all the terror leads to another happy ending where we don't need to be concerned? <br />This novel/screenplay ends with this:<br />\\"But then it kept going, kept evolving.<br />And they let it.<br />*They didn't understand what they were doing*.<br />I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race.<br />I hope it's not.<br />We might get lucky.\\"<br />We didn't even get lucky enough to get a real novel with the required end of the world finish that this material demands. Instead we got a novelist with a medical degree who gave into the very same forces that drive the scientists in \\"Prey\\" and the company they work for to produce a \\"nanoswarm\\" that would in reality destroy all life on this planet. The driving force in both cases is greed.<br />Greed drives those at the fictional company Xymos to produce a nanoswarm that the Pentagon will pay for (actually you and I would pay for it), and greed drove Michael Crichton to turn this novel into a Hollywood screenplay. <br />*Greed will destroy mankind*.<br />I don't think the artificial life forms created by greedy scientists with the approval of greedy university presidents will bother to write us a tombstone.<br />If you want to understand \\"Why the Future Doesn't Need Us\\", then read the article by that name from the April 2000 issue of Wired Magazine by Bill Joy, who just happens to be a computer programmer, the creator of the Unix operating system. You can find it with a search engine.<br />I warn you though; it does not have a happy ending.
0066620996|5.0|This book asserts the value of the right people -- rather than just people -- as the greatest asset of a company. Good to Great is a book that explores the leap from mediocre thinking to extraordinarily positive thinking within a company. But have you stopped to think that &quot;great&quot; may not be the best possible standard. Are you settling for second best? In today's competitive corporate world, companies must strive to be their greatest, their best. I recommend Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self by Rosalene Glickman, Ph.D. as the essential resource to optimize the thinking and performance of individuals and corporations. We can't achieve peak performance when we think suboptimally. Leading companies employ Optimal Thinking to optimize thinking, productivity, morale and profitability.
0060977493|5.0|This book is a feat of literary architecture. Its subtle accusations of society's suppression, and its examination of love and its power are exquisitely intertwined to quietly nurture each of the character's humanity. Roy has conquered prose, and each passage moves into the next like the flowing of the river. This novel is more than insightful, it is undeniably aware of the pain and joy of life.
B00005JKJA|5.0|(This review reveals many details about the plot, so consider yourself warned..) I think that Mulholland Drive is one of David Lynch's most complex and puzzling movies of all time.(except for maybe Lost Highway) In a nutshell-Mulholland Drive is about a character, named Dian Sewlwin, escaping reality through a dream.  Only to be brought back to a horrifying reality that she has created for herself.  The first half of the movie is the dream which is subtly hinted at numerous times in the movie.  The movie starts with a close-up of a pillow and slowly fades to black.  The dream is again hinted at with the line \\"I left Ontario and suddenly I'm in this dream place.  The dream ends when the character cleverly named \\"The Cowboy\\" pops into Dianes room and says \\"time to wake up pretty girl.\\"<br />Anyways, now that I'm done trying to convince you that the first half of the movie is a dream, we can return to the story now.<BR>In the \\"reality\\" portion of this film, Diane moves to Hollywood to pursue an acting career, but to no avail.  That is until she meets an up and coming actress named Camilla Rhodes. Camilla helps Diane get small parts in some of her movies.  They end up becoming romantically involved until Camilla meets a young Director named Adam. Diane becomes increasingly jealous which culminates to a climax with the announcement that Adam and Camilla are going to get married.  This sends Diane in a rage which leads her to actually hire a hitman to kill Camilla.  She regrets what she does and can't get over what she has done.  The guilt becomes to much to bare. Now we're up to speed.<br />O.K. back to the \\"dream\\" portion of the film
B0000062GE|5.0|Its amazing to me how anytime something bad happens to me I always end up buying a CD that has someone singing about the very topics that I am dealing with at the time. In this case, my brother recommended the CD hoping to help me find something that would ease some things I was going through. I bought this CD and was amazed at the range of emotions this band emits during this CD. Perhaps this is my own personal interpretation, but it seems as though Stabbing Westward wrote an entire album dedicated to breaking up. The album begins with Darkest Days, a song about having to deal with his inner rage over having to be alone, to the short but amazing Save Yourself, which is basically a kiss off song. Each song covers a different emotion that is felt during the break up process, and every song is sung with such emotion that it had a true effect on me; I felt it, and something I haven't had happen to me with music in a long time. Perhaps this is just the way I interpet the CD. This band had sheer and raw talent. I have since learned that they have disbanded, which is a terrible shame because their music, from what I've heard was simply amazing.
B000083C49|5.0|This is one of those rare instances where I've elevated my rating of the film (4 stars) based on the quality and enjoyability of the extras.  First - the film.  This is not the best Trek film (I like both II and VI better), but it is the most universal and therefore more enjoyable to people who are only passingly familiar with the series.  Even though it's the 3rd in the \\"Death of Spock\\" trilogy, there is little flashback information and you don't need to be familiar with the previous 2 films to find this one entertaining because most of the story is stand-alone.<br />The plot: a probe threatens the Earth, only Humpback Whales can correctly answer the probe, so Kirk and company must travel back in time to get some, since they are extinct in the 23rd century.  This kind of environmental message is familiar to Trek fans - the Original Series tells us of other species extinct by the 23rd century (e.g. American Bison), and the time travel trick is standard from the series.  Once back in time - the 1980's - our heroes split up to (a) find whales (Kirk/Spock), (b) fabricate a whale tank (Scotty/McCoy/Sulu), and (c) repair the ship's dilithium crystals, damaged in the trip (Uhura/Chekov).  Because each crew member has a mission, there is ample screen time for all, and we see more interpersonal interactions than in most of the films.  There is ample fish-out-of-water humour as the crewmembers try to navigate the streets of San Fransisco, come to terms with hard currency, and master public transit.  Subtle social commentary is injected throughout, again in the fine tradition of Star Trek.<br />This DVD edition looks and sounds great.  The effects stand up well, although the overall film seems to have aged poorly relative to other Trek films (probably because it was 1980's topical).  There are lots of extras, and they are mostly enjoyable - interviews with Gene Roddenbury's son and Mark Lenard's daughters give a neat behind-the-scenes feel for some of the creative talent behind the film.  The commentary with both Shatner and Nimoy is fun, and the text commentary by the Okudas is again fascinating and fun.  For whatever reason, I enjoyed these extras much more than on the previous three Trek \\"Special Edition\\" DVD's.
B000000H42|5.0|This is Mercyful Fate's best and possibly one of the best ever Heavy Metal albums.  The twin guitars (the best HM twin guitar ever) are dramatically brilliant and the vocal is awesome.  Just try.
B00006SFLV|5.0|When I saw that this was on DVD I was genuinly shocked.  While 4 seasons of Friends and the dead Dark Angel are transferred to quality DVD before something like Northern Exposure or Thirtysomething, it's suprising to see a show of such quality given it's proper respect. Gorgeous in it's bumbling nervousness, this show is the only television that ever came this close to representing the anxiety of adolescence.  And for that very reason it was cancelled.  Despite the fact that this only lasted 2 seasons, and maybe because of that as well, it accurately and near perfectly captures those couple of years between the onset of hormonal havoc and the confidence gained from a first kiss.  The complete series: what more could you ask for?  Well, I suppose some special features.  Personally, the actual show (and in its entirety, no less) is special enough.
6305320802|3.0|&quot;Oaklahoma&quot; is my favorite musical of all time. It is a timeless classic movie for sure. For those people out there that have big screen tv's (53&quot; or above) and are looking to buy this DVD I would give this a lower review on the Picture Quality than the widsreen reviewer's opinion. They gave it a 4 outa 5 and I would almost give it a 1. The non-anamorphic letterbox DVD version or transfer was done bad. The picture and tones flutter constantly throught the movie. The colors are not steady and fluctuate from time to time from light to darker tones. That is shame. I was expecting a clear vibrant transfer of this classic but the studios decided to release this classic on DVD without any restoration. *Again please understand my review is based from viewing it on a 65&quot; using a top of the line a progressive DVD player.  On a smaller 'tube television' the picture is nice but still not what I would expect from a classic Cinamascope movie that HAD vibrant colors at one time. I really hope the studios will decide to restore this movie to it's true texture and release it in a anamorphic widescreen version next time instead of this lousy  lettrbox version. The sound is in THX 5.1 and has pretty decent transfer that I'd give a 4.Overall: 3Picture quality (on a  big screen projection widescreen tv) = 1 (outa 5)Sound = 4 (outa 5).
B000092Q4U|4.0|I really didn't go into \\"as the palaces burn\\" with high hopes. it was 10 bucks at the local cd hole and I'd heard some older tracks that were okay so I picked it up. over the next few weeks the cd slowly became a guilty pleasure of sorts. I knew it was kind of trashy, but i must say, it's a hell of a strong album, and very fun to listen to. the playing is all dead on, and the songs are, for the most part, very rewarding.<br />the lyrics are pretty diverse, covering topics from the typical god hating and misanthropy, to some pretty interesting issues of politics, and the unjust hatred for the south. I was actually pretty impressed with the lyrics, from time to time(something I was NOT expecting). of course there's still the occasional all to metal phrase like \\"my redemption lies in your demise\\" to get past, but that sort of adds to the discs charm. it's so metal I can't help but love it.<br />I won't say this is the best album of the year, but it's certainly enjoyable, and really a lot more intelligent than you might think
B000002L9W|4.0|This album is much better than any of Van Halen's that followed it.  David Lee Roth has so much energy in his voice that it makes it very difficult not to enjoy this album.  No two songs sound alike.  Recommended to Van Halen/DLR fans.
B00005NGZX|5.0|this cd is really something. Every track is good, and I really mean that. To fully apriciate Jane Doe, one should listen to it all in one sitting, and that isn't at all hard to do.<br />The band is really on top of their game here, with some very impressive drum work, guitar work so sharp it cuts your ears, and a scream that I swear is not coming from a person.<br />on &quot;Thaw&quot; bannon sounds more like some sort of huge cat, screaming in pain. it might not sound like i, but I mean that as a great compliment. every time you think he's reached his peak, Bannon shrieks just a little higher or a bit louder. this scream combined with the rest of the music creates a very surreal wall of noise that demands you sit in awe and let Converge rock your face.<br />this cd is an experience. while most tracks stand on their own, the cd should be heard in it's entirety to get the full effect, and what an effect it is.<br />the lyrics, if you can figure them out, are pretty typical of converge. they sometimes do border on the cliche, but the delivery can make you feel like you're hearing it for the first time. I still get shivers listening to Bannon yell &quot;i'll take my love to the grave!&quot; in &quot;the broken vow&quot;
B000002H70|4.0|Most of these songs are soft slow tunes.  Most of them also have long boring intros.  It takes a little getting used to, but after a while I guarantee you will love this CD.  The tunes get stuck in your head and the lyrics are incredible.  Recommended.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I doubt there's anything i can say that hasn't already been said about this album. it's beautiful, haunting at times, and all but perfect.<br />Sea Change is about as far from Midnight Vultures as you could hope to get. that's almost a shame because I love midnight vultures, but this is just plain better. beck creates sprawling, epic folk-saturated masterpices while wallowing in self pity, guilt, and all the other depressing emotions you can think of.  and somehow it's still, perhaps, the most enjoyable album of his career.<br />all I can say is I like it a lot, and you probably will to, if you don't mind that a lot of the pep is gone from Beck's step.
0780625129|3.0|What was the purpose of this movie? Was it to depict skinhead nazis as bad people filled with hate? No, everyone already knows that. The primary purpose of this movie is to associate conservative thinking as equal to racist nazi skinheads. In other words republicans are racist. America is racist!<br />Time and again in this film the ed norton character will carry on about main stream political issues such as welfare, immigration or the rodney king incident. He recruits new members by carrying on about illegal immigrants and how much they cost the california tax payer. Is that what these vile racist nuts actually care about? In one clip a particularly disgusting member of their group calls his sister a bleep bleep \\"democrat\\". His brother later quips his distain for hillary clinton. At a dinner table argument ed norton's mother has a boy friend over; a teacher who happens to be jewish played by elliot gould. The subject is rodney king. Ed norton of course is carrying on about how rodney king deserved to be beaten spouting disgusting racist names. At least two times during the discussion the L word is mentioned in distain. \\"Liberal hypocritcal bleep\\". Get the picture? Being liberal or democrat is the antithesis of vile racist scum. So a conservative then must be the same. Simple logic and a simple messge according to this movie. This isn't a political agenda? And of course the american flag always is flying high whenever these bigots are carrying on. The flag is there when the norton character explodes in a racist rage about the murder of his his fire fighting father. A few choice words about welfare are included in his out burst. The flag is there when the skinhead nuts get together for their little club parties. The colors of the flag are even there on the coffee mug of the leader of the skinheads. Get the message? <br />There is a second message in this movie. That is that racism is learned so therefore it can be unlearned. This is the redeeming quality of the film.The skin heads are not necessarily that way from the beginning but are manipulated to think that way. Racism has a trigger. In the course of doing a 3 year prison term he learns that blacks are people too and disassociates himself from the racist skinheads. <br />In case you think the the message has strayed from its original purpose don't worry. Near the end the ed norton character remembers some disparaging things his father said about affirmative action when he was younger. His dad called it \\"affirmative blacktion\\".  That apprently was the seed.<br />Does hate lose out to love and compassion? No not really. The end is depressing.<br />...........socks
B00005JLYU|2.0|The ladies are just not attractive enough.  Nor do they seem intelligent enough to work undercover.  Drew Barrymore is the only one with an ounce of sex appeal who can even come close to being a true \\"Charlie's Angel\\".  Bad casting.  These movies could have been utterly HUGE with better casting.<br />Heather Graham would've been great in this movie, along with someone like a younger Susan St. James or Angie Harmon.  Or even Kate Hudson or Brittany Murphy with dark brown hair.  DUH.
B00005JLWN|4.0|While this movie got hardly any support or promotion (only reason I heard of it was through a review at Entertainment Weekly when it came out on DVD) I was pleasantly surprised and pleased that I picked this up to rent.  I honestly don't know why it didn't get promoted more and why it didn't at least have any kind of word of mouth out on the street.  Christian Bale turns in another outstanding performance like he did in American Psycho.  Whether you liked American Psycho or not, you have to admit his performance was top notch in that movie.  Personally I liked it and I liked this movie.  I think Bale has the &quot;stonefaced/unemotional&quot; act down to a science, but showed off that he has greater range than just that in his arsenal.  The supporting cast was good in this movie and the action when shown was fast, furious, and very exciting.  Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a very solid entertaining film with a good message.  The action/drama/acting is all good and is definitely worth viewing!
0064471837|5.0|The narrator Tim Curry was awesome!  His reading of this story was spectacular.  I tried to read the book, but found it very hard to get into.  So I bought the audiobook.  What a treasure.  We ended up listening to it twice on a long trip.  I can't wait to hear Lirael narrated also by Tim Curry.
B000007S5B|5.0|I love this album!  it's how I discovered The Doors when I was 14.  It has strange, poetic surreal songs.   On the cover Jim Morrison looks more like a skinny beatnik than the more bear-like type he later became, and the music matches.   &quot;Love Street,&quot; &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot;, &quot;Summer's Almost Gone.&quot;    The sometimes louder, raunchier sounds of other albums I enjoy equally - but I'm glad I discovered this one first.  However, it may take some adjusting because it is a little bit different from the others - but look at the cover, listen to the samples &amp; you'll have a sense of what to expect.    by the way -even though I say it's poetic it is NOT one of the ones where Morrison reads his poetry, it's music all the way.
B000099T2L|5.0|Once again this talented girl has produced an album that you can't deny, this time all on her own ( without the D.C. crew) but still with a little help from her friends. Her talent in singing and songwriting is tremendous I would love to see her make a gospel album and sing some praises to the Lord for the tremendous gifts he has given her. She is a rarity in this business as far as female songwriters are concerned and she is definitely doing her thing.This album is very soulful and one of those that you can listen to from beginning to end. My favorite cuts on the album are definitely the two with Jay-Z: &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;That's How you Like it' , I also like &quot;Yes&quot;. You cannot front that she has some very good producers on this album<BR>as well. This is perhaps one of best R&amp;B/Soul albums this year. Beyonce you go girl.
B00005CDNK|5.0|This is ABBA's best album.   After the energetic DANCING QUEEN, the psychedelic EAGLE, and the disco SUMMER NIGHT CITY, ABBA made this, the final album.   Every moment is sheer brilliance except, perhaps, TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE (which is still all right because of the awesome synth-march at the end).   The best tracks are THE VISITORS (spooooky synthesized magic), I LET THE MUSIC SPEAK (poetry that would put Bob Dylan to shame), and THE DAY BEFORE YOU CAME (an electric voodoo masterpiece worthy of Jesus Christ).   Listen and be amazed.

I've been a fan of Pinkfloyd for longtime .To my deep reget I could not attend Roger waters IN THE FLESH concert. After i first watch the DVD. the music,lyric,musicians, programming,video just perfect. let the old Floyd songs alone.Roger waters solo songs prove that he is the man of his own philosophy [And of many people out there]. Listenning to &quot;It's miracle&quot;. the blend of music and lyrics make the song MIRACLE. Thank Jon carin you should be one of Pinkfloyd member.And the rest of musicians as well.The DVD must have in yours Pinkfloyd library
B000002UC5|3.0|Basically that's what this disc is.  The actual complete songs are &quot;Every Night,&quot; &quot;Junk,&quot; &quot;Teddy Boy,&quot; Man We Was Lonely,&quot; and &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed.&quot;  And &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; and &quot;Junk&quot; aren't really very good.  I don't know if McCartney was trying to be hip by showing the world his half-finished ideas or his self-confidence was so shot he couldn't finish them and this was the best he could do. Either way, the result is erratic.  The demo &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot; starts off this set and this is defintiely an idea he should've followed up on.  A great melody although it last maybe 30 seconds.  Interestingly, you can hear a door during the song indicating it was done at McCartney's home.  &quot;That Would Be Something&quot; is more of nothing.  Paul does get a funky lick going on guitar but he plays around with it and doesn't take it anywhere. It's just another demo'd idea to show his audience.  &quot;Valentine Day&quot; is an instrumental of no redeemable quality.  &quot;Every Night&quot; is first real glimpse of the Paul McCartney we know.  Shining acoustic guitars playing a gorgoeus melody buffeted by good singing--good stuff.  The instrumental &quot;Hot As Sun/Glasses&quot; is good.  A good riff that shows his musicianship well.  &quot;Junk&quot; is just that.  Started during the Beatles waning days, its no wonder it didn't make it on any Beatle disc.  &quot;Man We Was Lonely&quot; is the first time, unfortunately, that we hear Linda.  Her rather tentative singing here doesn't offend and the song is rather bland so no real damage.  &quot;Oo You&quot; is another idea that with more work, could've been a killer song.  As it stands, its a riff with some words (and not good ones at that) and that's not a song.  It sounds like he's demoing a song. Its one more half-baked idea.  &quot;Momma Miss America&quot; another instrumental is up next.  Its not bad, indeed it has its moments but did I buy a Paul McCartney disc for the instrumentals?  &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; is another almost-Beatles song.  Again there is reason for the 'almost' part.  Its a silly song sung in a rather somber voice but with a catchy chorus.  &quot;Singalong Junk&quot; is just a instrumental version of not so good song.  Why bother?  &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; is the highlight of this disc without a doubt.  Actually maybe having this cut on the disc hurt the album because it dwarfs every song on the disc so much.  Its that good.  People heard this song and they thought the whole album should've been like that.  His anguished vocals augmented by some inspired piano playing, along with superb twin leads make this a all-time rock and roll classic.  &quot;Kreen-Akrore&quot; closes the set.  Unfortunately, its an instrumental/chant song, which wouldn't be so bad if A) He hadn't of put so many instumentals on here in the first place and B) We had just heard &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; as nothing was going to top that anyway.  If McCartney had used some of his famous production skills and fully completed some these songs that beg for it then &quot;McCartney&quot; would truly have been an outstanding album.disc for the instrumentals?   &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; is another almost-Beatles song.

B000002JPA|5.0|This was the first of many Dream Theater cds I have bought.  It is to put it in a few words the best cd I have ever heard.  Not just one or two songs are good, but every single track on the album is awesome.  If you haven't heard Dream Theater, then you haven't heard good music or skilled musicians.  And if you have then you know this will be a good cd.
B00001PE4D|3.0|Cruel Intentions should be an amazing film: it features an awarding-winning cast; creates a vivid world of wealthy, degenerate excess; keeps one's attention riveted to the screen; and  boasts an especially deliciously evil performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar.  What it does not feature is a well-developed plot that \\"works.\\"  It is difficult to comment on this movie without discussing the ending and my negative reaction to it, but here is a rundown from my perspective.  Cruel Intentions is yet another adaptation of Choderlos De Lachos' novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses, only this time the story has been adapted to a more modern and supposedly hip setting.  Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian Valmont, the worst kind of rich kid whose only hobby or vocation is corrupting innocent girls.  He is now preparing to face his biggest challenge in the form of Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon), a paragon of purity who has recently penned an article in a major magazine about why she plans to remain a virgin until she is married.  Sebastian's brilliantly wicked step-sister Kathryn Merteuil (Gellar) makes him an offer he can't refuse: if he strikes out with innocent little Amanda, she gets his car; if he adds Amanda to his list of conquests, she will allow him to make her yet another conquest.  And so it begins.  There are a couple of running subplots about a ridiculously silly girl named Cecile (Selma Blair), but these do little to distract you from the central plot.  Sebastian is a disgusting individual, but he knows how to charm a female.  Annette can read him like a book, yet for no discernible reason whatsoever her feelings toward Sebastian begin to change.  Obviously and most predictably, his feelings toward Annette also grow into something real.  All this time, Kathryn is watching and waiting, maintaining her public persona of sweetness and respect while evil thrives and roils within her pretty little head.<br />The ending simply does not work for me.  It requires me to adjust my own thought patterns about everything in the movie without offering me any decent reason why I should do so.  Redemption does not have a place in any of the characters of this movie, and that is all I'll say.  The deleted scenes on the DVD are among the most important deleted scenes I've ever seen.  In explaining why the six featured deletions were made, the director invariably talks about how the scene would have changed the viewer's mindset at the end; basically, if these deletions had been included in the movie, the ending would not have worked.  It is true that these deleted scenes would have sabotaged the desired perception of the ending, but I say that the ending still does not work.  About the only thing the deletions accomplish is to make a couple of statements problematic owing to the fact that references are made to scenes the audience does not get to see.  In my opinion, the director unknowingly deleted part of the central story, and the fact that he did not recognize this as such explains why the ending comes crashing down like a ton of bricks.<br />Gellar's eye-opening performance does much to salvage the film to some degree.  Rest assured, her character Kathryn is no Buffy clone.  She is absolutely ruthless, ingeniously underhanded, and a master at hiding her dark side from the people she knows (aside from her step-brother, of course).  Daytime soap opera stalwarts can't compete with Kathryn in the evil witch department; if J.R. Ewing had had a daughter, it would have been Kathryn - she is just that good at being bad.  In the end, though, all the fun I had watching Kathryn was cancelled out by a most unsatisfactory and seemingly rushed ending.my own thought patterns about everything in the movie without offering me any decent reason why I should do so.

B000066HI4|5.0|I didn't know who this guy was until I was trolling around the Internet recently loooking for new music and came across &quot;I See a Darkness&quot;.  I've listened to it three times.  The first time I thought it was was good but slow.  The second time, I got goosebumps.  The third time, it hit me: this is one of the greatest pieces of popular music (if it can even be called that)in recent history.  Scratch that.  In history.  Its beauty is so overwhelming that words simply can't do it justice.  Like all truly great things, it takes a bit of work.
0393057658|5.0|Highly reccomended to fans whose teams overspend and get little return on investment.....the book gives you ammunition to finally prove to others that most people running pro teams are running them fantasy league style, not effectively using deeper analysis and out-of-ordinary, breaking-the-mold knowledge...
0385504209|4.0|Good book.  Suspensful read.  Let-down ending.  Also, too many contrived lectures between the characters.  It was a lot like a watered-down version of Sophie's World and really dumbed-down version of Foucault's Pendulum.  But for that it would have been five stars.<br />BTW, there are more clues in this book than many realize.  Check out the dust jacket liner notes for one.  Notice any oddly bolded letters?  Also, what's the significance about the number of pages?  More here than meets the eye of many of the reviewers.  BTW, got through the six levels of the website in 22 minutes....
B00000272N|5.0|Is it possible for a band to release a first album that is so good it outshines the rest of the bands material and each album goes progressively downhill afterward?  In my opinion no Alice in Chains album is as good as Facelift.  It simply and utterly rocks.  Whereas Dirt is considered the all time favorite for many Alice in Chains fans, this album is a lot cleaner and not so dirty as Dirt, no pun intended.  <br />What makes Facelift worth the money?  Signs of brilliance on every track, interesting and dark lyrics, accompanied by the awesome voices of Staley and Cantrell.  This is what many new bands strive after but most do not write such good music.  Listen to &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;I know somethin&quot;, and of course &quot;Man in the Box&quot; and become immersed in the sounds of Alice in Chains.  <br />BTW, purchase everything up to the self-titled album, because that marked the beginning of the end for the band.  As it seems that Layne Staley was already completely fried in the head from drugs.  Also the self-titled album had poor production, not unlike the new album from Metallica.  Long live Alice!

1400034779|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it was a light hearted change of pace from the darker more dramatic books I have been reading as of late. It was fun and well paced. It was easy to put down and pick right back up again, which is especially important if you are a mother of small children and have to steal away to read in small moments.<br />I agree that there were some editorial errors as mentioned in other reviews, but I found them easy to recognize and move on. The errors didn't really deter that much from the story or, more importantly, the place the story takes the reader.<br />After finishing the book in no time at all, I found myself eager to buy the sequels. I would recommend this book simply for the wonderful whit and observation of Mma. Romatswe and the simplicity of reading a good old fashioned detective novel.

B00005JM09|2.0|It happened, right there in front of me (and the six other people in the theater, besides my wife), another one of my favorite franchises bit the dust on the third film. It happened with RoboCop 3, it happened with Alien 3, and now it happened with Terminator 3. I guess the warning signs were all there- no James Cameron, no Brad Fidel music and Industrial Light & Magic put to mediocre use- but like an optimistic fool, I had high hopes any way. Given director Johnathan Mostow's last filmmake opus was U-571, I should have heeded the warning signs. Even with the brilliant mythology that James Cameron, William Wisher, and even Harlan Ellison had come up with, I was given to wonder if Mostow, the seven *SEVEN* producers and four screen writers had actually even seen the previous two films. Or if they did, were they paying attention and taking notes?     The Terminator series has been near and dear to might heart since it debuted in 1984- I have been a fan. I have soundtracks, books, comics, games, DVDs, and special effects books on the series. It established James Cameron as a director and made Schwareneggar a mega-star. The original was a gritty, dark, and brutal science fiction drama based very loosely on two stories by Harlan Ellison (\\"Soldier\\" and \\"Demon With the Glass Hand\\"), and gave us very memorable characters. The second film was a slick, big-budget action film with ground breaking special effects, brutal psychology and scenes that left the audience in stunned silence with tears in their eyes. Both films have stood up well, even the original with its stop-motion animated Terminator endo-skeleton still looks very good in this age of CGI everything. Mostow, on the other hand, takes all of that and makes hash of it. He rapes the mythology and history, even going so far as to render one of the major story points in Terminator 2 irrelevant.     Set in Los Angeles of 2003, Terminator 3 is seven years after the apocolypse `Judgement Day' never happens, it being avoidedby the second Terminator, Sarah and her son John and the sacrifice of scientist Miles Bennet Dyson, when they blew up the CyberDyne offices. Apparently, it didn't work- Dyson's sacrifice is meaningless, and all they accomplished was to postpone Judgement Day. Now, instead Skynet arising from a private company fulfilling a military contract, it is instead created the US Air Force and un-named `civilian contractors'. As a back story there is an internet-wide virus wreaking havoc around the world, and the government is ordering the Air Force developers to unleash the Skynet AI to deal with. How a military defense computer intelligence, designed to control ICBMs and stealth bombers, is capable of destroying a computer virus is never quite explained.     What also isn't explained is how John Connor went from a smart, hip 11 year old to a 23 year old loser. Instead of getting Edward Furlong back to reprise his role, (who would be the right age exactly for the part), they get Nick Stahl, who delivers most of his lines as though he were half asleep, and doesn't really come to life until the last quarter of the film. Kritanna Loken, who plays the over-hyped T-X `Terminatrix' has almost no screen presence, even lacking the sense that she's supposed to be an unstoppable killing machine that Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick did so well in previous ventures. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't even that impressive- over using the sun glasses cliche twice too often and no where near as threatening as he was in the first two films. Claire Danes is arguably the best aspect of the film- she's a good actress, but serves almost no purpose other than to be a foil for both Connor and the Terminator, and to give a reason to go to the Air Force base.     The film's editing is a real mess and so the pacing the suffers. Admittedly, the crane/firetruck chase is as good as any action car chase I have seen, but it's in the middle of the film, so by the end you realize it was the highlight. The T-X'sover the top technology- she's basically a T-1000 crossed with a 101 series, liquid metal over an endo-skeleton with built in weapons. Even that isn't enough to make her scary or even seem dangerous. She gets run over, crushed, pinned to a particle accelerator with an electromagnet, thrown through cement walls and shot with rockets and grenades, emerging unarmed- but drop a helicopter on her and her legs fall off. They never give the impression she was taking any damage. In T2, near the end, you knew the T-1000 was starting to have problems with the way his form shifted and couldn't control his body.     Cameron must be laughing his guts out over this. But the laugh is on us- yet again Hollywood has perpetrated another cinematic stink burger on us, and we filed in to see it like bovines. I didn't totally hate it- the special effects were quite good, and I was pleased with the ending- I must confess to not quite have seen it coming. However, making Skynet the cause of the virus that's causing the problems undermines why Judgement Day happened at all. Originally, the newly self-aware computer trigger the launch of nuclear weapons because the humans tried to unplug it- it felt threatened. All of this is forgotten or lost, and this time Skynet does it `just because'. The upshot of all of this is, I can safely say there won't be a Terminator 4- he won't be back, and we'll be better off for it.

So I really appreciate books on tape programs like this one.Robert Kiyosaki covers all of the major points taught to him from his Rich Dad and mistakes from his Poor Dad.I found myself comparing my family background to Kiyosaki's 'Poor Dad' Isn't it amazing that we take advice from people who we love deeply because they are sincere, but are also broke and sincerely wrong!I highly recommend this tapeset to anyone who wants to get on the fast track to financial success and remove embedded/incorrect mental programing.
B00006F2TV|5.0|As a person who grew up during the era when comic books served as a primary media for entertainment nourished by the weekly Saturday serial and matinee, I am drawn to the tales of the legendary superheos. The Phantom, the Shadow, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman have all been transferred from the pen and ink print to the &quot;silver screen&quot;. Spider-Man is not quite as seasoned in the superhero folklore genre, but it has been a fascinating tale about an interesting character that I've followed along with my children over the years.<br />The Superman and Batman series had some great character portrayals and exciting special effects... but nothing like we have been given in Spider-Man. This is a superhero that I had always believed would be impossible to portray in &quot;real&quot; life. The abilities possessed by the &quot;Webslinger&quot; seemed as though they would be impossible to recreate by someone in the &quot;flesh&quot;.<br />Well, color me super surprised and totally flabbergasted. This talented group of people have done a superb job of replicating the &quot;action&quot; from the Stan Lee character. Tobey Maguire is a very believable Peter Parker and a super Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is superb in developing his character as always. Kirsten Dunst captures the charm and beauty of M J, and J.K Simmons is great as the cynical J J Jameson.<br />BUT!! The real credit for the stupendous success of this superhero character portrayal goes to the people behind the scenes that have created a masterpiece of fantasy that transcends reality. The antics of the Green Goblin on his &quot;flying surfboard&quot; and spidey's acrobatics and swinging through the city streets on web strands attached to skyscrapers are mindboggling.<br />This is truly one of the most exciting and entertaining films of this decade. I have watched Spider-Man several times and each time discover something new and amazing that previously escaped my scrutiny. However, if you don't have the imagination to visualize the living superhero from a comicbook page, you may not recognize how truly amazing this portrayal has been developed.<br />I hope that we will get to see a couple of sequels... there is certainly a lot more to tell of this tale.gination to visualize the living superhero from a comicbook page, you may not recognize how truly amazing this portrayal has been developed. <br />I hope that we will get to see a couple of sequels... there is certainly a lot more to tell of this tale.
B000009VOL|4.0|I've always thought that I'd only enjoy a completely new band to me, through hearing the album while I'm sleeping...Well, Moon Pix is fantastic, 'cause it makes me fall asleep right away and I wake up feeling refreshed...songs like &quot;Metal Heart&quot;, &quot;Back Of Your Head&quot; and &quot;You May Know Him&quot; are like hot milk to me!<BR> When I stopped to listen to the cd, paying attention to the lyrics and melodies...it kinda let me down...but still the distinct voice of Chan Marshall makes me fell like someone was putting a child to sleep...which is a beautiful feeling!
0380789019|2.0|On the paperback edition of this book, one reviewer is quoted, comparing Neverwhere to &quot;a dark, contemporary Alice in Wonderland...&quot; I must agree, Neil Gaiman's writing is just as confusing as that of Lewis Carroll's, except less &quot;classic&quot;. Some ideas were appealing to me, such as the young girl Door's ability to &quot;open&quot; things, but most were not. (For example, the London Below is a whole seperate world made of sewers, rats, people who speak to rats, and people who speak to rats who are taken away by the &quot;darkness&quot; never to be seen again.) Many concepts are left unexplained, and the ending is unfulfilling.
B000002C1W|3.0|I will simply say this: it is MUCH better than &quot;The Final Cut!&quot;
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is an awesome musical that is both fun and funny. The songs are incredibly catchy..Oh yes oh yes they both reached for the..VIDEO, lol. You too should reach for this video. the acting is superb. Kudos to Rene and Queen Latifah (she's an awesome big momma). This is a classic so pick it up.
B000002U9W|2.0|Another reviewer said \\"Impossible to listen without falling asleep.\\" Exactly, I used to put it on when I got in bed, and it would do just that. I think people that honestly say they like it are just saying it because it was put out by PF. I mean, I am a PF freak as well, but I can also say this is one of my least fave albums, though the guitar work in the first song on the album is good (I am writing this without having listened to this album in a *long* time, which is why I don't remember the name of that first \\"song!\\")<br />Unless you are a religious PF fan, or maybe just looking to waste money, I would not buy this album if I were you. Go buy Meddle or Animals or something else that PF did - you probably won't listen to this more than once.
B0000025H6|5.0|Great album, even with all of the self-indulgent lyrics. Fault me for not analyzing things enough! I just love the music on this album - &quot;Young Lust&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot; are two of the better ones, along with the obligatory &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot; and &quot;Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2.&quot;<br />Buy it if you don't have it. You must!
B000024D4R|5.0|I think this album rocks - literally! Much harder rock than most PF albums, the three main songs are good and yes, long (\\"Dogs\\" is something like 17 minutes long!). Dogs has to be the masterpiece of this album, with Sheep being my second fave. Don't let people scare you away from this album with their over-analysis of the album - it is a good time and should not be taken too seriously.
B000075BFK|4.0|I give 2pac Better Dayz cause it is just not as good as the ones as when he was alive and most people cant tell the different even though i am big 2pac u like Better Dayz go get some more 2pac cDs All Eyez on Me and more so get out there buy Better Dayz cause this  is a a Cd u will miss out if u arent goin to get this Cd and the all the great songs in it Thugz Mansion and  more
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin spends two years creating their own record label and then emerges with this masterpiece.  Taking songs that they have written since Houses of the Holy and combining it with material that they had written as much as 5 years earlier and they created the best double album since The White Album.  It opens up with the ferocious Custard Pie and The Rover. BTW the opening riff on the Rover is great.  In my Time of Dying was long but well worth it.  Trampled underfoot was classic. Kashmir is one of the greatest songs ever.  While the second disc is not as solid but is still good.  The highlights on that disc include Bron-yr-Aur, a nice little acoustic instrumental courtesy of Page, and Ten years Gone.  A nice very well done song.  If you do not have this album, buy it now
0790734850|4.0|Watched this one with mixed feelings, good thriller with a soundtrack that could pass for a 'time life sounds of the 50s' cd, just nothing like as good as it could have been. It would be impossible to be totally faithful to the novel, the resulting film would be 16 hours long and banned in most countries on the world, but really, there are few sub plots abandoned that could have fleshed out the film better than alot of the bloated phoney elements that made it.<br />While the novel is savage the movie is just a style statement, a pastische,  harking back to an era that never existed, all the ideal period clothing and hairdoes can't dismiss the feeling that this is pure fantasy. Its all so artificial and stagey, from the colours to the watered down language, check out the scene where Bud White first meets Kim Basinger (i hope the plastic surgeon who cut her to look like Veronica Lake didn't receive any payment for his work), she somehow manages to smack her lips and coo at the same time while talking to White, surrounded by unnaturally vibrant blues and reds on a street that just shouts 'movie set!!'. Whereas with Elroy you can believe that while it isn't the truth it is an alternative reality that could easily have been without a massive leap of imagination.<br />LA Confidential the movie doesn't even come close to finding the core of Elroy's book. The Ed Exley character (Guy Pierce) in the novel starts out already ethically compromised, by the end he is well on the way to becoming what he is in White Jazz, a character whose only redeeming feature is that he isn't as evil as Dudley Smith...  In the film he starts out a good cop and by the end he's an even better cop!  The escaped black suspects in the film are fired upon by his partner in the raid and they return fire, in the novel he is alone and they are unarmed, he guns them down in cold blood. Is this LA confidential or LA the official story?<br />I don't buy into that lazy generalisation that the literary sources for films are always better than the films themselves... great novels can make great and original films that have departed considerably from the literary source, and bad novels can make great films (as anyone who has tried to read kiss me deadly can tell you). Besides, why compare two artforms (hm, i think i have been)? My problem with LA Confidential is not that it has strayed from the book, but that it has done so little with it, turned it into a laboured, mechanical thriller with two dimensional characters that for the last 50 minutes seems to repeatedly lurch from revelation to climax (denoted by very loud music), policemen burst into empty rooms guns out and contrived plot devices abound (rollo tommasi anyone?).And i'm a bit sick of 'idiot flashbacks' in films, we see a charcater from earlier in the film on a slab in the mortuary and register the look of familiarity on our heroe's face (not to mention the use of our own memory) and we get a flashback just in case we're not paying attention (Gangs of New York is the titan of this irritating cinematic convention)! And in the end LA isn't that bad a town, there are a couple of gangsters (mostly dead or in jail) a bunch of out of town gangsters made to do Smith's work, three corrupt cops, two blackmailed politicians, a high class pimp and a tabloid journalist.<br />Doesn't seem right to complain like some that it ends with a conventional shoot out, after all the novel does ends with 3 shoot outs.  How else could you top off hundreds of furious pages stuffed with serial killers and gangster conspiracies except with a burst of violence?.<br />As for it being one of the best film noirs ever made as is suggested by several people here (i'm not sure i would classify it as a film noir) i would suggest that either they hadn't seen enough film noirs or that if they had they didn't appreciate the artistry involved or the dark places they went, taboo breaking detail, their complexity and subversive qualities (even if thisis overstated and exaggerated in readings of some of the more well known film noirs). I keep discovering great seemingly forgotten noirs, thanks alot of the time to David Thomson, the man is a constant source of information, the like of 'The Reckless Moment', 'Where The Sidewalk Ends', 'Angel Face' (and i notice they just released 'They made me a fugitive' on DVD!). <br />Having said that there is an effort to show the underside of the hollywood dream (i refuse to say 'american dream', i'm just sick of reading about the darkside to that! Even if they are maybe one and the same thing). Even so LA Confidential is as safe as movie making gets, pretty compromised studio film making (this isn't a diatribe against hollywood, i enjoy their films much more than french tripe with some handsome young man with long dark hair defying the nazis/english/revolutionaries with depardieu in a supporting role.. or a modern british gangster film). After all this is a money making business, in all fairness i doubt Curtis Hanson and team could have brought anything darker to the screen than what they did for studio fears of making a loss, kudos for them bringing it to the screen at all.<br />So why 4 stars? Well... i quite liked it, just don't believe the hype. Besides there are already 200 reviews on here that suggest its the bee's knees.... And on a positive note... So many characters from other Elroy novels are co-opted into this one and killed and Dudly Smith himelf is shot dead it seems unlikely that this team will attempt to bring any of the rest of the LA quartet to the screen. <br />Criminal waste of Mickey Cohen (surely the gangster subplots could have remained without turning the film into a Scorcese sized monster?) and as good as James Cromwell is he's no Dudley Smith, as flawed a film as 'Dark Blue' is it offers us Brendan Gleeson as a Dudley Smith like figure, did noone consider him for the part of Captain Smith? He was pretty close to the character....
B00005JLRT|1.0|It's hard to find where to start with this mess of a movie. But I think it is all summed up that when Data dies -- I did not feel a thing. No trace of sadness. Nothing. Nada. <br />When Counselor Troi is crying at the eulogy -- I thought to myself \\"Pathetic\\". I felt nothing.<br />I think the Next Generation movies have been a mixed bag just as with the original cast movies -- but even when they missed it was not this bad.<br />We have no idea who the bad guys are -- no idea what makes them formidable -- it's all glossed over. WEAK!!<br />Don't waste your time with this turkey --
B00005JLR2|2.0|I bought this DVD mostly based on the other recommendations.  This is not a good film.  It isn't horrible, and it shares the universal appeal that all animation has for children, but there are better things to do with your time.<br />The animation is good, but not great.  A game like Final Fantasy displays more imagination when fusing sailing ships and space travel.  You certainly see why hand-drawn animation is being replaced by computer animation.<br />The plot is abysmally shallow.  The lead character was obviously designed by a committee, hoping to create someone with which today's teenagers could identify.  Most of the sidekicks were even more bland than the lead (was there any question how Morph would impact the story?  Did Martin Short's robot character contribute *anything*?).<br />I'm sure Disney consulted many focus groups to patch together this script.  I wish they had taken a chance with a more inspiring storyline.
B000062YAZ|5.0|First, I would give this album INFINITE stars if they were available because unless you already know, you truly do not know how completely vicious and destructive this album truly is. When I first heard of Slayer, I was in 6th grade. A Catholic school kid who had recently gotten into metal (thank you Anthrax), I was still impressionable and due to the climate of the day, very fearful of &quot;satanic&quot; music. As I got into more like Iron Maiden, King Diamond, and The Misfits, I let my guard down and upon hearing &quot;South Of Heaven&quot;, I started to become a Slayer fan. By summer of 1989, I was no longer intimidated by the &quot;evils of heavy metal&quot;. I was ready to buy &quot;Reign In Blood&quot;.<br />I got home with my copy of &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; and headed directly for the garage, broke out my launch ramp and blasted the newly purchased cassette on my radio. The following ten songs were life-changing, each one more brutal than the last. By the time it was over, my friends and I were forever changed. We had found the most brutal recording we had ever heard to date. It was more engaging than anything before or since.<br />Musically, in today's world, many a band has gone on to write albums that were more technical, heavy, etc. but at the end of the day, Slayer has still achieved the accomplishment of a lifetime in &quot;Reign In Blood&quot;. No other band has garnered the kind of crowd response that Slayer has and I seriously doubt any band has ever come close. Maaaaaaybe Pantera...but i doubt it. Opening bands were booed off stage and had things thrown at them. Pits were more violent than any ever saw or has seen since. I even heard stories of people diving from the balconies multiple times and (my personal favorite-supposedly happened right here in Chicago) a die-hard fan who hung upside down from the balcony of the Aragon Ballroom in the shape of an inverted cross and screamed SLAYER. Disturbed, Staind, Slipknot, etc. will NEVER see that kind of fierce loyalty EVER. &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; is the album responsible for it all.<br />Today; in 2003, &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; still ranks as one of my 5 favorite albums (metal and other) ever made. The pure evil that spews from every second of that recording puts a smile on my face and still sends chills down my spine like no other record. I could be told right that I'm going straight to hell and as long as they are playing Slayer downstairs, I'll accept my fate with a smile. It is truly that good.d of fierce loyalty EVER. &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; is the album responsible for it all.<br />Today; in 2003, &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; still ranks as one of my 5 favorite albums (metal and other) ever made.

6304702205|5.0|Fan or not, I'm betting that you will enjoy this second music video of Yanni. Filmed at India's Taj Mahal and Beijing's Forbidden City, you will hear, see and feel Yanni, along with 50 musicians and singers performing some amazing music.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Don't take that title as a rip on The Mars Volta in any way. I was just amazed that; being on a major, there is no rapping, scratching or one-chord tuned down. For those who liked At The Drive In, you already knew some of what to expect. For anyone else, get ready to be shown how rock is supposed to be played.<br />The Mars Volta; quite simply, is a fireball of energy and extreme talent rolled into a music group. They do bear some tonal similarities to ATDI but that's basically where the train lets off. The members of ATDI that formed The Mars Volta took the feel and urgency of ATDI and plugged it into a whole new outlet, blending jangly indie rock with a mesh of soul, prog rock and Latin to come up with probably the most intersting thing any major label has to offer this year alone. The songs explode and swiftly swoon you into seduction, only to explode in your arms once again and it is all pulled off with the absence of flaw or mistake. They have enough to offer to please a wide range of musical interests and with any luck, they will heralded as the new wave of rock music, driving the final nail in the coffin of nu-metal. Staind, Disturbed, Linkin Park, etc....you have been warned.
6303011012|5.0|If you are or you are not a Yanni fan I believe you will still enjoy this video. The music, muscianship and stage presence is amazing.
B00005JM09|4.0|So Cameron didn't direct it and Linda Hamilton or Eddie Furlong weren't in it.  But guess what people?  You don't need two out of those three things.  Because even though James Cameron didn't sign on, the movie was still just as good.  Although it would have been nice to at least see a Linda flashback.  And as for Eddie, well lets face it, almost anyone could have played an older John Conner.  The only thing I really missed was the old music from the Termiator movies, you know \\"dunu du dunu... dunu du dunu\\".  But as long as they didn't replace Schwarzenegger with Van Damn, I was happy.    So here's how the story starts off;  You got little Johnny Conner giving the narration for a few minutes and he explains what's gonna happen to us in the future (like we don't already know).  Then we see the new terminator (the TX, some hot chick) and the old Terminator (Schwarzenegger) beam up out of thin air.  The TX immediately goes on a killing spree taking out no-bodies on the street (or so we think at first) after getting some new threads.  While the old terminator gets his new cloths from a male strip club (the guy was gonna take them off anyway).    We then go back to John stealing pain killers from a veterinarian hospital.  He can't go to a real hospital because he lives his life off the grid (no credit cards, no social security number, no identity).  An old junior high friend of his that he made out with once (Claire Danes) works at the vet hospital and she ends up getting kidnapped with Conner after the two machines find them and each other and duke it out for a little bit.    From there it's an all out chase involving a Pick-Up truck, a crane truck, a Fire truck, a police motorcycle, two cop cars and an ambulance which have no drivers.  Our new bad terminator not only has the same powers as our old bad terminator (Robert Patrick, T2) but she can also turn her arm into weapons (plasma gun, flame thrower, etc.) and she can also control other machines with the flck of herfinger (no really, but kinda yeah).    From the big chase to a cemetary (where \\"someone speacial\\" is buried) to pick up an arsenal of weapons hidden inside a coffin (big shoot em up scene), and then to see Danes characters father.   Her father is in charge of the whole Skynet program so he decides if it should be used or not (so we all know who to blame when the bombs drop) to get rid of a computer virus infecting half (or all, I can't remember) the worlds computers.    As the new terminator shows up at dads job to reak havoc, our heros show up just in the nick of time to slow her down.  But not before dear old dad presses the go button on Skynet (nice work pops).  As soon as he presses the go button the machines all around them start killing people and all hell breaks loose.  Conner and Danes character (can't remember the name) find out how to stop Skynet once and for all from dad as the heavy weights go at each other.    The TX knocks out Schwarzenegger and then reprograms him to get rid of John Conner for her.  Does he pull it off?  Does he go against his orders to protect John Conner no matter what?  I'm not saying.  That's all I'm giving you for this film because I want you to go out and see it for yourself.  THERE WILL BE NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW (at least no big ones).    So the movie was great, the cast did a pretty good job, the effects were pretty amazing and you didn't need James Cameron for all you people out there crying because he didn't get on board the T3 express.  Could he have done a better job directing?  Maybe maybe not, we'll never know.    The only reason I gave the movie four stars was because there wasn't alot of gore in it, not like the last two Terminator movies.  In the last movie you see the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) slicing and dicing everyone he comes across.  You see contact, blood, painful expressions on peoples faces, the splater when a bullet hits someone.  In this movie you only get that once, maybe twice.  And the girl playing the TX had a little to much emotion.  She wasn't singing \\"Put on a happy face\\" while dancing down the street but she did have kind of a smile in what she did.  But I guess you gotta love your work.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Before buying &quot;Elephant,&quot; all I knew of The White Stripes was the song &quot;Little Room,&quot; which I hated! I'm not the most adventurous music fan, so I never gave the band another thought. But while wandering around a music store, I saw &quot;Elephant&quot; as a featured selection, and decided to give a listen to the tracks on the store's headphones. I was so impressed with the first 10 seconds of each song that I bought the CD. That was three weeks ago, and it's still in my car's CD player. I love the raw, crunchy guitar sound and Jack White's voice. The songs are excellent, too. My favorite is &quot;Black Math,&quot; but I really like the ballad, &quot;You've Got Her In Your Pocket,&quot; and the rock flavor of &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;You Have No Faith in Medicine.&quot; It isn't often I stumble across a new group I like this much. I subsequently purchased both &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; and &quot;De Stijl.&quot; While I like both CDs, &quot;Elephant&quot; is by far my favorite.
B000003TA4|5.0|I never thought I would like Nirvana. I had heard of them of course; who hasn't? The grunge music of the early '90s passed me by due to my age at the time and when I heard the word ''grunge'' I just thought of murky flat guitar music with no beat, no melody. Well,''Smells like Teen Spirit'' changed my mind although the first way I heard the song ( or rather the parody ) was Weird Al Yankovic's ''Smells Like Nirvana'' which is very funny but not the original. Even listening to Weird Al's<BR>very different lyrics I loved the beat it reminded me  of Lifehouse instantly in ways other Nirvana songs don't.Now I know why Jason Wade cites Nirvana as a influence. Now ''Smells Like Teen Spirit '' has become my favorite song-it' so easy to fathom why it became Nirvana's anthem-it's their best song.My other favorite tracks are ''Lounge Act'' which is very playable song just resonating Kurt Cobain's voice and ''Lithuim'' which is again gorgeus and ''Polly'' which has lyrics that are set in a interesting manner to the music. ''In Utero'' is more poignant <BR>and sadder though it is still a masterpiece; the last, the best<BR>With ''Dumb'' the song that even more than ''You know you're right'' coould be Kurt Cobain's elegy. Lyrics like ''I'm dumb or maybe just happy'' have been interpreted as refering to drug use.<BR>However, it it could just as well mean death. This album is great. Nevermind, the legacy of Nirvana lives on.
068817776X|5.0|If you are interested in this part of WWII, be sure to read this one.  It is well written and easy to read.  No ranting, no theorizing, just plain reality.  I just finished the book and I can't stop hurting for little Gretl!
B000000OQF|5.0|In 1987 few bands sounded as raw and powerful as Guns N' Roses.  While many bands took on a very polished and sometimes wussy sound, GNR came out with a very real sound.  Much of the material on this album reminds me of Aerosmith around 1975-1976.  Welcome to the Jungle is probably one of the greatest songs ever.  Sweet Child O' Mine is an awesome ballad.  Other standouts are Rocket Queen, Paradise City, Mr. Brownstone, Nighttrain, and It's So Easy. While Axl has a good voice for this record Slash is the heart and soul of this record.  His guitar playing gives this record some balls. While many other hard rock and hair metal albums of this time have gone forgotten, this gem still stands out and still sells.  Why?  Because it was real.  I read in a magazine that the tracks on the album did not take more than three takes each.  It's too bad Axl went on an ego trip and sacked everybody.  Now his guitarist wears a KFC bucket on his head.  If he knew what was good for him, he would get Slash, Izzy, Duff, and Steven and hit the road without canceling their shows.  In 1987 they had something real great.  If you don't have this album, get it now.
0446608955|5.0|I loved the book and was dissappointed when the movie didn't play out the same way. Nicholas Sparks knows how to grab a reader's heartstrings at any age.
B00000JRTX|4.0|A delightful film funny, irreverant but with heart.
B000001G5A|5.0|I bought this CD on holiday, listened to the first movement and was hooked straight away.  You've never heard Mozart this passionate or dramatic or flawless before in your life.  The end of the first and last movements just beg to be listened to with headphones and the volume up as high as it can go.  Ditto with the big sumptious endings with the organ in the middle movements.  <br />The (slightly odd) trombone solo in &quot;Tuba Mirum&quot; is pretty much perfect, just like the rest of it really!  I have no basis of comparison with other recordings of Requiem, but I think I have picked the best - I don't think it could be improved upon.<br />Please, buy this piece of music, even if it isn't this recording, just get it; it's too good to miss.
B000060P79|1.0|You know, it's just so hard being a kid these days, and Simple Plan...well, wouldn't know. This is, of course considering that every member of the band is of or above legal drinking age in the states and has created a new kind of poseur status. No, I won't wave the \\"You're not punk\\" finger at these guys, maybe I will, it isn't punk rock if that is what you want to know, pure bubble gum pop with distortion, nothing more. Ok, back to the part about them being poseurs. Their lyrics are that of a 16 year-old's journal. If they were 16 years old I would understand, but a 21 year old singing about how tough it is when dad takes aways the car and grounds me, what does he care anymore, he can move out. The songs are about high-school romance and they've long since graduated, I think and I just find this absolutely hilarious. <br />I could probably mistake this band for a group of 16 year olds now that I think about it. I was channel surfing and noticed that MTV had a \\"Behind the warped tour with Simple Plan\\" segment coming up and figured that I had to see that. It was too good. They all had their perfectly spiked hair, except for the bald guy, and acted like children that somehow stole instruments and decided to jump around a lot. Punk rock was bound to be exploited (no pun intended because the Exploited were a disgrace to punk rock) and I knew that this day would come. Hey, it has been coming for years and is now in full force with the new boy bands (following the demise of the likes of Nsync and the Backstreet Boys) complete with relationship confidentiality contracts. Throw in the goofy stage presence (i.e. Everyone jump on cue) and a rowdy group of underage girls and boys in  Hot Topic fatigue and put Simple Plan on the mainstage but not for their talent.<br />They need to live it up now because songs about \\"sneaking out of your parents house on Friday night\\" just won't fly when you're thirty, or twenty-five. How long will it last?...
B0000024JA|5.0|Calling Mr. Meth the best lyricist in the Wu is a bit naive. But... you have Gza-the roughest, ODB-the craziest, and RZA-the sharpest and in my opinion a damn sick M.C. But the most prominent and clever is the Method Man. This, his first solo was produced by the RZA. If you liked no. 9(Method Man) on 36 Chambers you will love this album. Not only are the beats rough and eerie(like I like 'em),the lyrics are a brilliant mixture of clever wordplay and down right sickness. On this album, Meth is the twisted guy buried deep within us all. For example-\\"I'll stab my own moms in the back for a sack, n!ggas like 'Damn, why you on it like that?' 'cuz I'm a dog and I got no love for the cat!\\" That's just an example of the man crossing the line, but you know you love it. My favorite joint is \\"Mr. Sandman.\\" And \\"PLO Style\\" is delightfully politically incorrect. Also reccomended: \\"Gravediggaz: Six Feet Deep.\\" Have you had your meth today?
B000002U82|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece. When I was 14 my dad suggested that I buy this album. I did, and wasn't disappointed at all. Roger Waters and the gang pulled off a psychedelic, atmospheric masterpiece that still has intelligent, meaningful lyrics with socio-political views all on one continuous track.
B00000DOZV|3.0|This 1976 album was Genesis' last studio album before they began their transition to pop, as well as guitarist Steve Hackett's last album.  The band was trying to return to the drama of \\"Foxtrot\\", but the album has pacing problems.  There are too many songs with few moving parts, and as a result the songs come off seeming slower than they really are, giving the overall album a plodding feel.  More upbeat pieces like \\"Pigeons\\" and Hackett's \\"Please Don't Touch\\" were left off the album, which didn't help.  While all the songs are fine on their own, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  If you're already a fan of '70s Genesis, this is definitely worth buying; if you're not, there are better Genesis albums to try first.<br />There are three great songs here:  \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\", the instrumental \\"in That Quiet Earth\\", and the ballad \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" (despite the title, it's actually about watching too much TV, and it features some lovely acoustic work by Hackett).  The other songs are ones that Genesis fans grow to enjoy, but may not impress the casual listener.  \\"One for the Vine\\" is the most problematic track -- a long story-song by keyboardist Tony Banks that just isn't catchy enough to sustain its 10-minute length.  It straddles the border between enjoyment and tedium, but some fans consider it a classic.  \\"Your Own Special Way\\" is a pretty ballad, but the electric piano bridge is SO slow that the album screeches to a halt.  \\"Afterglow\\" is a block-chord finale that is a favorite of many Genesis fans, with impassioned singing by Phil Collins.  \\"Wot Gorilla\\" (an instrumental based on the catchiest riff from \\"One for the Vine\\") and \\"All in a Mouse's Night\\" (just what the title suggests) are the most inconsequential cuts on the album, but at the same time they're two of the liveliest tracks.  I hope that someday the CD will be re-issued with the \\"Spot the Pigeon\\" songs included (three outtakes that were released as an EP).<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
0451191153|5.0|Many people constantly compromise their most precious gifts in life in order to satisfy the wishes of the majority.  In this story Rand reminds us that the only way one can come to greatness is if they first fight the masses.  In order for something to be great, it must have at least a grain of originality.  Forget the objective philosophy and see this book for what it is, a great story which recognizes the need for humanity to stand up for their beliefs and for their gifts.  Many of Rand's philosophies are incorporated through this theme, but there are major flaws in my opinion with the belief that all greatness comes from pure egotists.  No one is a pure egotist and no one is a pure altruist.  Pure and simple, this is a great story that uses paradoxical characters who are so simple but appear very complex.  It's definitely worth reading.

B000067J1H|5.0|This movie accomplishes the difficult tasks of being thoroughly entertaining while providing the viewer with something to think about. The story itself is great, and appeals to that little (at least) bit of anarchist in all of us, and Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do wonderful jobs with their respective characters.
B000021YQV|4.0|I am not a fan of the nu-metal scene, but I just had to get this album. My favorite songs on this album are Prison Song, X, Chop Suey!, Forest, the title track, and Ariels.

B00005JKZV|5.0|This film does live up to the expectations I had of it. I knew that I could not expect every little detail from the book, and that this film, just like the Fellowship of the Ring, would become an instant favorite of mine. There are points in the film that I frowned at, such as the scene with Aragorn falling over the cliff, but I know that changes had to be made to adapt such a long book into a film. I also understand the fact that this movie as well as the other two have been and will be made for the masses, not just for us Tolkien enthusiasts. You can't expect everything from the book, Peter Jackson gave this film his maximum effort, I'm sure. And when such a page-to-film adaptation occurs, I know that dropping things from the original text has to be hard, but it is how things work. As for effects and the filming itself, It is superb. The landscapes and beauty of New Zealand jump from the screen, and describe Tolkien's world of Middle-earth as good as his linguistics allow. No better could they have done for this film, then they did, and I expect an even better film for The Return of the King. I recommend this book, film, and any other Tolkien-related item to anyone who has the time enough to learn and love his beloved Middle-earth. To close, I would like to add that Tolkien himself is the greatest author of all time, and anyone who says otherwise is either wrong, or nearly right.
B000089J0R|5.0|THESE GUYS RULE. <BR>I don't see how anyone could give this cd less than 5 stars. <BR>If you know metal then get this cd and you will see what<BR>i mean.

B00005JLWN|5.0|This is THE movie for all the NEO/BLADE fans!!  I loved it.  At first I thought, \\"man, this movie is really slow\\" and then, BOOM! You are caught up in the story line and all thoughts of time and space disappear as you sucked into the movie. Unlike most fight movies where every character (to include bartenders) can last 2 minutes in the ring with Mike Tyson; in this movie, if you fatally wounded, you are down.  And in the end, ....<BR>well you know the rest.
0525457585|5.0|With a maximum of 1,000 words, I can hardly begin to translate the amazing quality of this novel into words.  One must not be led astray by the poor movie counterparts, supposedly taken from this book.  It is indeed a work for all to read.<br />The story opens to young Bastian Balthazar Bucs stealing the Nverending Story from a nearby bookstore.  He soon finds himself reading of the heroic Greenskin Atreyu on his mission to heal the kind Child-like Empress from her deadly disease, the illness threatening to kill her and all of Fantastica with her fall.<br />Bastian is soon brought into the story, by means of crying out the Empress' new name.  Bastian's adventures in Fantastica, as he utilizes the powers of the Auryn (a magic, wish granting pendant, blessed by the Empress) will send you through all of the wondrous domains of Fantastica.  You will be enthralled, as the tale matures from a simple adventure with Atreyu, to Bastian's story of happiness, power, corruption, fear, and humility.  You might even find an almost allegorical feel to the story.<br />I would recommend this story to anyone, and I greatly grieve how unknown the amazing work of Michael Ende truly is.  He must not be known for only a poor movie, but for an amazing story, deceivingly childish in its writing, yet almost profound in meaning.  Creative is truly an understatement when attempting to describe Michael Ende's The Neverending Story.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This CD is what Mariah Carey's Christmas CD tried to be...and failed. Christina's powerful voice and soulful interpretations will stir you, and her faster tracks will have you bopping all over the room. I have this in my car and I listen to it year round. My very favorite song is a slow, soulful, bluesy rendition of &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; that really showcases her vocal ability. I also love her version of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; -- a difficult song to sing well, which starts out as a traditional carol, goes thru a spoken prayer (that prayer is my LEAST favorite part of the album), and ends when she brings in the choir. You want to get up and sing Hallelujah with this song!
B00005K9LM|5.0|Defenders of the Faith contains some of the best guitar work and songwriting ever recorded in the heavy metal genre. The sound of this album creates a dark yet melodic mood that is totally unique. DOTF proves that melodic music can be extremely heavy. The songs are well thought-out compositions and there is not a weak track on the record (the bonus tracks are weak - just push Stop after the original album tracks end).<br />Freewheel Burning - 10 (pure speed metal mayhem)<BR>Jawbreaker - 9<BR>Rock Hard, Ride Free - 10 (fantastic guitar work)<BR>The Sentinel - 10 (dark futuristic number that reminds me of Terminator)<BR>Love Bites - 10 (good groove, but knowing what we now know about Halford I don't ponder the lyrics in great detail)<BR>Eat Me Alive - 9 (see Love Bites)<BR>Some Heads Are Gonna Roll - 10 (written by hired songwriter Bob Halligan, Jr. - proves that just because something gets on the radio it is not necessarily bad - contains my favorite guitar solos)<BR>When the Night Comes Down - 10 (dark, slow-paced ballad)<BR>Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith - 10 (awesome plodding concert fist pumper)<br />Bonus Tracks:<BR>Both rate 5 - nothing special.<br />The talent and level of musical inspiration shown on this recording was not matched again by Priest or any other band afterward. Coincidentally, the best heavy metal album of all time, Metallica's Ride the Lightening, was released the same year. Apparently there was just something in the air in 1984.
B00006BTCA|4.0|My ex-girlfriend pressured me to go out and buy this album upon it's release.  I'm indebted to her.<br />It's no mistake that listeners at Amazon have recommended that listeners rush out and buy a copy of Joy Division's seminal classic, 'Unknown Pleasures' instead of Interpol's equally bleak, relentless urban cityscape, 'Turn on the Bright Lights.'  I'd recommend you get both.<br />Amazon listeners have also recommended you go out and buy the Chameleons' 'Script of the Bridge,' one of the best albums to come out of the post punk/new wave rennaissance.  If you're even remotely a fan of post punk, you should probably own Script of the Bridge.<br />The guitar-scapes are very similar.  It's a flat-out miracle that something so close to 'darkwave' has found its way into popular music.  The vocals are indeed reminiscient of Ian Curtis, albeit less raw and a little more stylized.  <br />My recommendation: learn to love Joy Division and the Chameleons, but relish Interpol for what they've been able to accomplish here.  Don't knock them for advancing the sonic brilliance of the bands that have clearly influenced them.
B00005JM09|5.0|After having to sit thru the pile of crud that was \\"XXX\\" recently, I have to say how nice it was to finally see a real action movie. This is how you do it. Arnold may be getting older, but he can still show the young 'uns what an action film is. Are you listening Mr. Diesel?. The plots to these films are filled with techno gizmo and all that kind of stuff, so it hardly matters what exactly the movie is about. After all, it all comes down to the action and the special effects. This one has got it all. The first two films in the series were classics in the genre. It's tough telling how this one will rank in the series with die hard fans, but I am here to tell you that this is one fun ride. So, how exactly do you come back after the groundbreaking part 2?. How do you top it?. Apparently, after seeing the movie, you don't. The effects are fantastic and cool, but they don't seem to build much upon part 2. The female terminator is incredible, but her attributes don't outdo or better Robert Patrick's from the previous film. Basically, it just stays with the flow from the second film with eye popping action that outdoes everything in action films in recent years and great effects. The story takes place ten years later, although it has actually been twelve years since the last film came out. John Connor, now played by Nick Stahl, has been keeping a low profile. He has no phone, no address, and lives on the street. Can't find him that way. A female terminator named the T-X, played by beautiful Kristana Lokken, comes to town with one thing in mind. Kill John and prevent him from becoming the future leader of humankind. She starts going thru everyone associated with him and leaving them in body bags. In comes the T-101 cyborg(Arnold)to protect John, although he was originally designed and programmed to be an assassin. His mission is to also protect the lovely Kate Brewster(played by the lovely Claire Danes), who is an old acquaintance of John's and has a connection with him inthe future. Arnold must keep them alive, keep the terminatrix at bay, and stop machines being controlled by computers and destroying the world. Arnold is back in action and reclaims the action king crown. He's getting older, but it is definitley not an issue. He doesn't look much different than he did 12 years ago. I would still much rather see a 55 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger, or a 60 year old Harrison Ford, than a 25 year old anybody else. This film also has a welcome dose of humor as well. It is able to be funny and crack jokes and play with itself. Other action films take themselves so seriously, that they are laughable. Again, must I mention \\"XXX\\"?. Stahl and Danes are most welcome as the two human heroes. Stahl is a likeable presence worthy enough to cheer and root for. It is somewhat surprising to see Danes in a movie like this. She really fits well tho. She is human and brings real human feelings and emotion to the proceedings. She is very sweet and lovely looking to boot. Kristana Lokken does what there is to do with the character. She is icy and cold and lethal. It also isn't a negative thing that she is nice to look at. The dialogue is pretty tight, from what you can make out of it from all of the technical mumbo jumbo, and everything moves right along at a nice pace. There is even a cameo from Earl Boen, who appeared as Dr. Siberling in the original film. Nice touch. It is a bit sad that Linda Hamilton wasn't involved. She was missed. The movie is everything you'd expect from an action movie and everything you could want in a Terminator film. The action is incredible. It just keeps coming. A chase scene with firetrucks and all is an impressive sight. Teriffic. So, it's a slam bang, fun filled action ride that is sure to please die hard action fans. I enjoyed it a lot and I think anyone interested in this sort of thing will be too. Diesel still isn't ready to play with the big boys.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Two words...Shower Scene!<br />Not to mention the awesome action! One of the best sci-fi films ever made.
B00008OWZC|5.0|...This is the greatest live album I have ever heard.  All you have to do is listen to Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love to realize just why Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band ever!  I couldn't believe that I was hearing a live event.  Page's guitar playing is so tight and precise while Bonzo lays down the hammer like no other...  To make a long story short, I recommend this album.  If you're a Rock n' Roll fan, not only Led Zeppelin, you should add this to your collection.  This is Robert Plant, Jimy Page, John Bonham, and John Paul Jones at the pinnacle of their careers!
B00005JKPF|4.0|In this day and age of lousy sequels, it's great when a filmmaker manages to up the ante and deliver an even better movie than the one that precedes it.  \\"X2\\" is one such example.<br />Although it's recommended you see the first movie to familiarize yourself with this one, it's not totally necessary.  This one has a bigger budget, and goes further into the character development without sacrificing any quality.<br />If Bryan Singer can make the third movie as good as this one, we'll be in for a real treat.  Wachowski Brothers, you might want to take some notes.
6305350205|2.0|Early in 1989, Paramount Pictures had four relatively to highly successful \\"Star Trek\\" films under its belt.  The most recent from 1986, \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\", was the most successful grossing $133M worldwide on a budget of $25M.  Hoping to do just as well with a fifth film, Paramount invested $27.8M, but only grossed $70M worldwide when it was released, which was worse than any of the previous films.  Why?  \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" may have had a larger budget than its predecessor, but far less was invested in writing an engaging plot.  Since Leonard Nimoy had directed and co-wrote the previous two films, William Shatner was granted that privilege for the fifth film (both as director and co-writer).  Unfortunately, even the writing skills of co-writer Harve Bennett (who had worked on the previous three films) were insufficient to help this film's plot.  Also contributing to this film's story (and author of its screenplay) was David Loughery, whose only previous film work had been the 1984 film \\"Dreamscape\\".  Clearly, the two inspirations for this film's story were Loughery's \\"Dreamscape\\" and one of the final third season episodes from the original \\"Star Trek\\" television series, which was entitled \\"The Way to Eden\\".<br />The story for \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" can be summarized as follows: a religious fanatic, who is obsessed to find paradise and the creator of the universe and who seemingly has the ability to release people from their inner pain, pretends to take a group of dignitaries hostage in order to steal a spaceship capable of taking him to where he believes his obsessions will be found.  The twist is that the religious fanatic is a banished Vulcan, Syboc (Laurence Luckinbill), who rejected logic in favor of emotion.  Naturally, the ship to be stolen is the brand new U.S.S. Enterprise-A, under the command of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), whose Starfleet rank of admiral was reduced following the events portrayed in the previous two films.  With Captain Kirk is the rest of the Enterprise crew including Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Captain Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commander Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  The dignitaries include the Federation Representative St. John Talbot (David Warner), Klingon Representative Captain Korrd (Charles Cooper) and Romulan Representative Caithlin Dar (Cynthia Gouw).  <br />Though \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" is mostly disengaging and uninspiring, it has a few memorable scenes including the mountain climbing scene, the camp-out and McCoy reliving a painful decision regarding his father.  Unfortunately, these scenes constitute no more than 8% of the film's 107 minutes.  One of the worst scenes in the film is Nichelle Nichols' fan dance.  Of the acting in the film, DeForest Kelley did a stunning job in spite of everything else, but the other regular cast members were rather animated.  Laurence Luckinbill as Syboc was reminiscent of some television evangelists.<br />Overall, my rating of for \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" is 2 out of 5 stars.  What prevents me from granting this film a 1 star rating are the contributions from DeForest Kelley.  If you are considering purchase of this film, consider the fact that this film contributes nothing to the continuing \\"Star Trek\\" story line that was presented in the previous three films nor to the film that followed it (and was much better).  Clearly, of all ten \\"Star Trek\\" films to date, \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" remains the worst.  A more appropriate title for the film would have been \\"Star Trek V: The Final Insult\\".

B000083C49|5.0|With many fans disappointed following the release of the third &quot;Star Trek&quot; film in 1984, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, Paramount Pictures produced one of the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; films of all time in 1986: &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.  Returning to the director's chair for what was only his second directorship of a big-screen motion picture was Leonard Nimoy, but this time, Nimoy had much better material to work with from the films many writers.  Nimoy (who actually took on-screen credit for writing) worked with returning writer Harve Bennett to write a brilliant story, and Bennett worked on the screenplay along with three additional writers: Steve Meerson, Peter Krikes and Nicholas Meyer (who directed the highly successful &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn&quot; in 1982).  Under the watchful eye of Gene Roddenberry, these men were able to recapture the spirit of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series more than any other preceding or proceeding &quot;Star Trek&quot; film.<br />Having restored Spock's (Leonard Nimoy) life via the Genesis planet and a return to the planet Vulcan during the third film, the crew of the lost U.S.S. Enterprise now waits on Vulcan for repairs on their captured Klingon scout-class ship, as well as for Spock to retrain his mind, before returning to Earth to face various charges for having disobeyed orders.  The crew includes Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commader Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  The Klingons are also very angry with Kirk as expressed by the Klingon Ambassador (John Schuck) to the Federation President (Robert Ellenstein) in front of the full Federation Council, but the cool logic of Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) prevails.  While on Vulcan, Spock gets to spend time with his human mother, Amanda (Jane Wyatt, who once played his mother in the 1967 &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;).  Also, a brief appearance is made by Lt. Saavic (Robin Curtis), who unfortunately never returns in any other &quot;Star Trek&quot; film.  With their Klingon ship ready for departure, Spock and his Enterprise shipmates begin their voyage to Earth; but unknown to them, a bizarre space probe also en route for Earth has been wreaking havoc on any ship that approaches it.  Arriving at Earth first, the probe turns Earth's atmosphere into chaos as it waits for a signal that the Federation cannot discern.  Receiving a planetary distress call from Earth, Spock identifies what the probe wants: communication with long extinct whales.  To save Earth, Kirk makes the decision for them to travel back in time to bring back whales to the present.<br />&quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; has more memorable scenes than could be mentioned here, but some of the best include: McCoy's conversations with Spock, the crew on the streets of twentieth-century San Francisco, Uhura and Chekov looking for nuclear vessels, McCoy and Scotty visiting the production facility, Kirk &amp; Spock on a city bus, Kirk &amp; Spock's conversations with Dr. Gillian Taylor (Catherine Hicks), Kirk's dinner with Gillian, and McCoy with Kirk &amp; Gillian at the city hospital.  Everyone's acting (including Shatner) was very good for this film, but what makes this film stand out from the rest is the emphasis on all of the original crew members.  Each of the crew members have time on screen, contribute to the story and have a reasonable amount of dialog.  Other familiar &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters have cameos in the film: Dr. Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) and Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney).  Another cast member in this film who later plays a pivotal role in the sixth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film is Admiral Cartwright (Brock Peters).<br />Overall, my rating of for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; is a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  This film, along with the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn&quot; and the later 1996 film &quot;Star Trek VIII: First Contact&quot;, are the three best films ever made of the franchise; but this film will always stand out as being the most humorous, having the best &amp; most memorable dialog and having the greatest spirit of the three.

B000063JDE|5.0|There is only one way to truly appreciate this movie.  View it over and over again.  Excellent cast and story.
0385504209|5.0|Well after finishing the book, a mere ten minutes ago, I am riveted.  The only reading that I'm displeased with is what some, not all, but some of the other people have to say here on Amazon.  If you were to ask me, there would be absolutely wrong with making up a bit of history to suit your readers.  I have no idea as to whether Dan Brown has actually done this, but if he has, one must understand that this IS a work of fiction.  I haven't heard one squabble over how Harry Potter doesn't have enough facts in...and why is this?...because it to is fiction.  My honest advice, begin to read this book and then see if you can stop.  I read the sample chapter online, bought the book the next day, and today, five days later, all 454 pages are complete.  Ignore those who are obviously ignorant to a good novel, this is THE thriller of the year.  This book would get 6 stars, but Amazon will only let me put 5 for now.
B00000JMOJ|5.0|Conspiracy, Arnold, Action, perfect recipe for a perfect movie.  You won't be disappointed.
0345442970|4.0|Cloak of Deception is currently the first novel on the time line (-33.01 before NH) that gives us a look at Darth Sidious.  This is the first novel setting up events that appear in Episode 1, PM.<br />This novel is well done and introduces the politics and subterfuge used by Sidious-Palpatine to manipulate events.  We also see how Palpatine damages Valorum and weakens the Trade Federation.  Sidious in a comic that follows the events in this book (Darth Maul TPB) weakens Black Sun by taking out its leadership.  We will see later how the TF army is absorbed into the Republic army.<br />We also are beginning to see a problem with the Jedi council that we see more of in the future...  Windu is both a pacifist and not to smart, and Yoda has delegated the day to day running of the Jedi to Windu.  Yoda is more concerned with the training of the Padawan's.  This in-attention to detail by Yoda could be what leads to the destruction of the Jedi.<br />Luceno does a great job of writing in characters that we are already familiar with.  We meet Darsha Assant and Anoon Bondara from Darth Maul, Shadow Hunter. We also meet Vergere from Rogue Planet and the New Jedi Order.  Even Tarkin and Sate Pestage (primarily a character from the comic books) make their brief appearances.  This book is a solid story for most of its 268 pages, and I would delete almost none of it.  COD ends with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan being assigned to the Naboo Trade dispute.<br />Regarding the audio CD:  Alexander Adams is the best reader since Anthony Heald.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has stepped away from her Mickey Mouse club origin and evolved into a very mature sounding artist. Now she may have a questionable behaviour or sense of dressing, but there is no question about her talent that is displayed on this album. This album deals with alot of issues in our everyday life. Songs like Beautiful and Fighter we can all definately relate to. It gives us hope, inspiration and empowerment. Her voice is powerful and soars through all the songs. By contrast, Britney Spears once overhyped and who emerged at about the same time looks like an immature trapped teenage brat who cannot seem to move forward.<BR>An album to own.

It's like he takes you ito the war with the men of easy company almost like you went to CURAHEE and beyond with them.
B00005JM09|4.0|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines pulls several impressive tricks.  One, it manages to be a highly entertaining movie.  Two, it takes the plot thread questions of the first two movies (the most glaring being, if the future was altered why is John Connor still alive) and takes the tale to the next step, which is...well, just see the movie.  The action is stunning, the acting good, the humor funny, and, by the film's closing minutes, it is clear that there is more than enough creative juice left in James Cameron's characters and concepts to fill another movie.  Fans should be happy about that, for a change.  Highly recommended.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I know I am in the minority on this one, but that can't change the fact that I had laughed exactly two times by the time it was over.  I certainly expected an evening of &quot;gut-busting&quot; laughter when I sat down to watch it, considering every single person I talked to said it was one of the funniest movies they had ever seen.  However, as I continued to watch, I began to wonder if I was seeing the same movie everyone else saw.<br />Now, I do tend to favor a different type of comedy, namely the Christopher Guest movies &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, &quot;Best in Show&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, but there have been a decent amount of what one would call low brow comedies that I have enjoyed.  I liked the Austin Powers movies and &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, I even liked &quot;Half Baked&quot; with all its stupidity, but &quot;Old School&quot; was just a dud.  The jokes and gags all had a oddly familiar feel to them, like I had seen them already many times over, and they had lost their appeal a long time ago.  Even the turn of events in the movie, with the cliched &quot;mean dean of the college&quot; and the against all odds ending didn't come off as funny but rather as tired and overused.<br />There really isn't much more to say about &quot;Old School&quot;, I mean, it's not like it warrants an in depth analysis of its &quot;plot&quot;. To me, it's just a movie that failed to do what it was supposed to do, namely making me laugh.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I would have to say I am a Star Trek Voyager fan, and I favor the Voyager sereis out of the whole Trek genre. And I also keep up to date with the Next Generation crew and their movies. I would have to say Star Trek Nemesis is a huge improvement over Star Trek First Contact and Star Trek Insurrection. But it did not surprass Star Trek Generations.  I do not like how the Borg are depicted in the Next Generation.  I always saw them as Janeway's enemy, not Picards, so that's why I was dissapointed in First Contact. Perhaps one of my favorite parts of the film was the cameo appearance of Admiral Janeway (Voyager's former Captain) who gave Captain Picard his orders. This is an enjoyable film, loaded with action. But I would have to say it's time for the Next Generation crew to really move on, and so that's what this film depicted. If they do make another Trek film it should defintely feature a Deep Space Nine crew or the former Voyagers.

0790729652|5.0|The ladder is the second sentence uttered by the imposing Dark Knight, and it helps launch the spectacular &quot;Batman,&quot; rich in noir-tinged storytelling, larger-than-life production design, director Tim Burton's ambitious vision, Danny Boyle's muscular, rhythm-driven score and sure-footed acting.  All of these elements contribute to to craft a modern classic, one that makes the last two Batman films directed by Joel Schulmaker look like child's play (no pun intended).<br />The film picks up in a Gotham City, a crime-infested metropolis on the verge of giving into its decadence.  Into this comes Batman (played with brooding brilliance by Michael Keaton), a caped, seemingly indestructable vigilante who fights crime at night.  On one occasion, he fights crime lord-to-be Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) and sees him fall into a vat of chemicals.  This eventually turns Napier into the Joker.  The whole story is concocted by Sam Hamm, who gives it a steady-pace to let the story tell itself and allowing plantey of time for plot and character development, something Joel Schulmaker desparetly needs.  Also caught between Batman and Joker, is the vuloptuous Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) whom both Joker and Batman take a liking to.<br />To perfectly complement the dark story, is gritty and shady production design by Anton Fursk, who won and Oscar for his work, and deservedly so.  Fursk captures the essence of Gotham City, which is its dirty and deviant underbelly and dark tones.  And Director Tim Burton uses them to all their extent, which, when combined with Burton's ambitious, visually stunning direction, makes Batman into what it should be.  And Danny Elfmans' sinewy score sets a perfect musical complement to the films' spectacular visual elements.<br />To make &quot;Batman&quot; complete, there is confident acting by all the cast.  The best is Micheal Keaton as the brooding Dark Knight/Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier/Joker as he flashes his killer smile proudly.  Nicholson is the highlight of the film, having as much fun as possible with his maniacally gleeful character.  But right there with him is Michael Keaton, who the ideal actor for Batman and Bruce Wayne.  He perfectly captures the brooding essence of both men, proving he is by far the best Batman so far.  But both Kim Basinger and Robert Wuhl turn in exceptional performances as reporters trailing Batman.<br />Arguably, this first entry into the Batman franchise is the best.  It had the production designer, the script, the composer, the director and the cast to make it a classic.  It seems timeless, having aged gracefully into this new millenium, which is quite a statement.  And by all predictions (including mine), it will stay that way.udly.

B000063V8T|5.0|After living in Russia for four years without any Trek, I had to buy the DVDs. It's been wonderful to re-live and share the series with my friends and we are all looking forward to DS-9 and Voyager as the season sets arrive.<br />Only one small complaint about formatting. I normally skip the prolog \\"Space, the final frontier ...\\" and go to the second track. However, the second track does not always take you to the begining of the first scene after the \\"commercial break\\". As a rule of thumb, if after 5 seconds you don't see the name of the episode, track back until you do. You could be missing up to 5 minutes!!!
B00004STDN|4.0|Before this one, Stallone had a series of flops, but this one is definately one of his best & shows a more human side to Stallone not seen since Rambo II & Rocky, In this he is Gabe, a mountain rescue worker who fails miserably in a misguided attempt to rescue his best friend's girlfriend in a climbing expedition gone wrong, while crossing over to another peak on a cable, she soon loses her grip, Gabe attempts to rescue her but fails as she falls to her death at least 100 stories up, the film then proceeds to its plot where the Treasury is getting ready to transport three cases of International money by plane, it is soon hijacked in mid-air by a group of International terrorist led by John Lithgow who has a field day as bad guy Eric Qualen with one-liners that would rival Alan Rickman in \\"Die Hard\\", as they attempt to steal the money with the help of a rogue agent, another agent near death after being shot by the rogue one, foils the plan in which case they lose the money in mid-air & watch as it falls to the mountains below, the agent soon shoots their plane before the Treasury plane that he is on explodes forcing them to crash land in the mountains, it is here that we see the return of Gabe who joins up with his resentful friend(Michael Rooker) to rescue what they believe are ordinary people, when they learn that they have been decieved by the terrorist they soon are in for the ride of their lives,as Gabe just barely escapes with his life & begins a one-man assault on the group as he locates their money one at a time, Janine Turner is here as Stallone's girlfriend who soon joins the action as she meets up with Gabe, as they attempt to stop the terrorists, lots of great action set-pieces, & Lithgow's performance is chilling, but you can tell he had fun, everyone plays their roles to perfection especially Rex Linn( Breakdown) as the rogue agent who see the errors of his ways somewhat toward the end, as he tells Qualin what to go do with himself, the last 10 minutesis intense & somewhat reminisent of \\"Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom\\" & fun to watch, it may borrow from \\"Indiana Jones\\" & \\"Die Hard\\", but not many movies have been made like this one in a mountain region!!!, Highly Recommended!!!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I give this album 4.5 stars.  I am a huge Radiohead fan and think this album is awesome and nearly perfect.  Pretty much every song is good.  The only reason I didn´t give it 5 stars is because I was really hoping for a little more energy in the album like Radiohead said we would see in an interview.  I didn´t see much of that energy I hoped for,  but still loved every song.  The standouts for me were 2+2=5,  Sit down. Stand up,  and Backdrifts.  These songs will stay in your head and won´t leave for days,  just a fair warning.  <br />For Radiohead fans,  I would have to say that this album would fit perfectly right after Ok Computer.  It isn´t as electronic as Kid A or Amnesiac and it would have been a good introduction to what was to come on both of those albums.  To those of you who don´t get the songs on the album or aren´t quite convinced that the songs are good,  try and catch a Radiohead concert.  I just did and they played many of thier new songs.  It really makes you see the songs in a different way and it makes you appreciate them more by how great they perform them.  Needless to say,  a Radiohead concert is the ultimate concert experience.  And for those who didn´t like There There that much, (I was one at first) thier concert will definitely change your mind about that song.  One of the highlights of thier show for me.   As for the album,  I was hoping for a little more energy,  but it definitely met my expectations of being an outstanding Radiohead album.<br />Sidenote:  I started asking myself &quot;Which Radiohead album are you?&quot;  I would have to say I´m a mix between The Bends and Kid A,  but if I had to choose,  I´d have to lean towards The Bends. ´Just´ a pointless question that you should reply to if you will review this album (I wonder how many HTTT´s we´ll have?)
0064409422|5.0|Book 2 of the 7 book series<br />The story begins as Lucy, an English girl hides in a wardrobe closet. Through the wardrobe she's transported to the land of Narnia, an extravagant place overseen by Aslan, a god-like lion and enemies of Empress Jadis, a huge queen. After coming out to tell her other 3 friends, they saw she's mad until they see for themselves. Now the 4 have to join forces to defeat the Queen.<br />Even though it's one book out of a series of 7, it's one of the most well known and also makes it one of the best. Depending on how you read it, it's either the first in the publication order or 2nd in chronological order so keep that in mind
B000003TAL|4.0|As I said in my first review of the album,  I bought this cd becuase of the hype.  What hype?  I don´t know,  Rolling Stone giving it 5 stars,  them always being compared to my favorite alt rock group,  The Pixies,  and David Bowie saying in a magazine interview that this was an extraordinary album and one of the best things he´s heard in the last 16 years.  Now after listening to the album several times,  I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4.  \\"But why not five,\\" you Sonic Youth fans might ask?  Well,  although I ended up really enjoying and getting into the album,  it still is not a 5 star album.  <br />Teen Age Riot, Silver Rocket,  Total Trash and Hey Joni are easily 5 star songs for me,  but to be a 5 star record,  they should all be,  or come close to 5 stars,  which I didn´t feel they all were.  Teen Age Riot and Total Trash are the exceptional songs on this album though.  I didn´t like it really at first,  but I ended up loving the way they play the guitar in Total Trash.  It was annoying at first,  but then I got to realise that this is great and you can´t get any more alternative rock than this playing guitar.  It just sounds all f-ed up and crazy,  which is exactly the way alternative rock is supposed to be.  I hope I get a 5 star Sonic Youth album later on.  Just don´t know which one it will be,  Dirty? Goo?  I guess I´ll have to wait and see.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown is a masterful writer who has taken on a difficult topic with great flair creating a roller coaster like suspense thriller that I could not put down. Unfortunately, he has some highly skewed sources and some gaping flaws in his Biblical scholarship. This is not significant to the non-Christian reader, or better yet to the atheist or New Age reader since their world view is not impinged on by such, yes, heretical notions.  Mr. Brown himself admits that the core of his book's conspiracy theory has been \\"whispered\\" for centuries and is not his own. His web site contains an interview of sorts that gives us a glimpse of his attitude to these \\"facts\\" and to his quasi-Christian beliefs. Mr. Brown, according to that same site, is in a writer's seclusion while working on the sequel to the \\"Code.\\" He cannot be contacted...My commentary and counterpoints may affect someone not yet having read the book except to say to the Christian reader, beware of the presentation of fiction portrayed as fact. Spiritual warfare is ubiquitous in this otherwise enjoyable if not misguided work.<br />The fundamental premise that Jesus was a man, not divine, not the Son of God makes the reason for the intrigue and the focus on His so-called lineage a puzzle in and of itself. If He was only a man, who cares who his decendents were. Even if this allegedly suppressed \\"secret\\" were true, how would this make his decendents important? There are 28 generations from David the King and the birth of Jesus the Christ according to the Bible. That is an awful lot of people. Joseph was not in line for any throne that he did not himself carve. The Princes in Brown's story is no more royal than anyone who believes in Christ and is therefore an inheritor of Heaven.<br />The divinity of Jesus is critical to Christianity. Christianity based on Jesus as some prophet with healing powers makes this faith no different than other faiths pinned on prophet leaders. Judeo-Christian traditions had many prophets none of whom became the basis of a faith within a faith that had any lasting power. Christ was different. His divinity was based on many things most importantly the \\"empty grave\\" or Christ's resurrection. No one ever came forward at any stage and alleged the grave was not empty, that his bones were found, or that he failed to defeat death. These are the facts of Christianity.<br />Then there is Leonardo, himself. He was indeed not a Christian for most of his life, just as is alleged in the book. The end of the story, Leonardo's story, is also important. On his deathbed, Leonardo accepted Jesus as his Lord and professed his faith without reservation. How does all of this affect your premise and plot line, Mr. Brown? Maybe you are right (from his Web page interview), your novel will provoke Christians to think. My hope is that they will think about what are the immutable minimums that make them Christian. I hope and pray they do not re-think their faith because your well spun web gives the misimpression of fact instead of good fiction.one of whom became the basis of a faith within a faith that had any lasting power.

B00004Y62T|4.0|Now, I am a person who generally judges a movie and a book independently of each other, as the screenwriter is generally only using the novel as an outline. (Unless the screenwriter is the author, in which case, no holds barred.)<br />But in this case, the above holds true -- the book is better, but this is a good movie. Once I divorced my memory of the book (which apparently only provided character names, setting, and very general plot) the movie went along quite nicely. Although, I must admit, I think that Jude Law would have made a better Ripley -- his acting seemed better suited for that role, and perhaps Damon should have been the carefree playboy.<br />Alas, the final murder in the movie is not in the novel -- so, if they are setting The Talented Mr. Ripley up for sequels, they will most likely not follow Highsmith's next novels, either.<br />A pity more wasn't done with Gwyneth Paltrow, who seemed almost at points more like a flat character out of 'Friends' than a movie-drama character. Alas, our Ripley gets away, for now -- will movie goers return to see the next installment?<br />The atmosphere of the drama was classic for the time-period of the novel.  The 1950s Italy, still recovering from the war and still catering in many respects to wealthy Americans at play fills the screen.  The posh airs of the almost-aristocracy, the world to which Ripley yearns to belong at any cost, come through with crisp realism.<br />The direction, art direction, costumes and general cinematography help this film to shine; the story, alas, is the part the drags, despite being based upon the sterling novel of Patricia Highsmith.  A little more allegiance to the novel, and perhaps some judicious minor editing would make this a truly classic film.<br />That said, it is a film I rarely tire of seeing.  It is worth seeing, and worth owning.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The 7 Day Theory is Pac's second best album, behind the untouchable All Eyez On Me. This is my 3rd favorite album of all-time, behind All Eyez On Me & Reasonable Doubt. It is amazing how such a perfect album could be put together in just 7 days.<br />1. Intro/Bomb First (My Second Reply): This is a diss to all the East Coast rappers Pac had beef with. I think this is one of the best songs on the album.<br />2. Hail Mary: Everyone has heard 50, Eminem & Busta's version dissin Murder Inc. but Pac's version is better. Everyone wants to be 2Pac and who could blame em? Listen to the song if u haven't heard it yet. This & Me & My Girlfriend made me buy this album before I heard the other songs.<br />3. Toss It Up: This is another one of my favorites. Two themes in this song. First he talks about sexin this girl and in the last verse he's dissin Dr. Dre for leavin Death Row.<br />4. To Live & Die In L.A.: Another diss to Dr. Dre. This is one of the best songs on the CD, if not THE best. Kinda laid back track as far as the hook and the verses are typical Pac. He describes life in LA on this track.<br />5. Blasphemy: Different theme, but I'm feelin it. Makaveli talks about the guidelines of the game and talks about thug life. The theme reminds me of Troublesome 96, with a totally different twist.<br />6. Life Of An Outlaw: Damn I LOVE this song. Don't get it twisted, I love the Outlaws but this song woulda been better if it was just Makaveli rappin. The beat compliments hisstyle more than the Outlaws. I still love it though.<br />7. Just Like Daddy: This is the love song that even a guy isn't ashamed to bump. Pac lets Khadafi shine on this, lettin him flow for 2 verses. Pac does the best though on it. Guys, trust me...your girl will love this hahah<br />8. Krazy: This song's hot too. Makaveli tries explainin how life is crazy for a thug. But it sounds like he's trying to keep his head on straight at the same time. I can't explain it well, just listen to it.<br />9. White Man'z World: This is a real hot song, even though I'm not black. He respects his black people, especially the ladies. He apologies for callin them names and he's tellin us how hard life is for black people.<br />10. Me And My Girlfriend: This is one of the most original concepts I've ever heard. It sounds almost like a ghetto love song, but he's really rapping about his gun. If I didn't tell you, would you have known??<br />11. Hold Ya Head: He's tellin you to do just that...Hold Ya Head. Even when life can become real hard, \\"you got to hold ya head\\"<br />12. Against All Odds: One of the verses will sound familiar to you, if you up on the mixtape scene. 50 Cent uses a verse from here on Hail Mary 2003...I'ma big 50 fan but I wasn't feelin that at all. The last track brings the fire, bombin on the East Coast rappers. I still like Nas, Mobb Deep & Jay-Z though. Even though Makaveli made em look like fools.
0767849493|5.0|Dogma, from the Greek word meaning opinion. Imagine that!<br />According to the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, `The original meaning of the word was \\"that which seems good\\", and hence it was applied by classical authors as a technical term either to the distinctive tenets of the various philosophical schools or to the decrees of public authorities.'<br />So, what does this have to do with the movie? Ironic as it seems for such a bizarre film, it all turns on a minor dogmatic point -- accepting that Roman Catholic dogma is the operative framework for the entire existence of the universe (something even I have yet to meet ANYONE who holds true), a logical inconsistency would render the universe inoperative, and thus it would blink out of existence.<br />--The Fallen Angels--<br />Enter the fallen angels. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon star as Bartleby and Loki, the angels who rebelled against God (not in the major, Satan-ic way, but in rather more minor work-stoppage way). They have been banned from heaven, and spend most of their time watching cartoons and hanging out in airports people-watching.<br />--The Dogmatic Hat-Trick--<br />In an attempt to 'update and popularise' Catholicism, a bishop in New Jersey (George Carlin, of all people) introduces a new campaign that includes a papal indulgence, which will absolve those who walk through the archway of a particular church. The angels discover this, and are determined to exploit this papal pronouncement to their benefit -- in dogmatic terms, whatever the pope says on earth is binding in heaven (not quite, but that's what the movie presents) -- and thus God cannot refuse them re-entry. This sets up the logical problem.<br />--The Last Scion--<br />The heavens charge a particular woman Bethany, (Linda Fiorentino), who turns out to be the last descendent of Jesus Christ's family (of course, the Bible left out the details of his family), with stopping the angels from reaching the church. In the course of her charge, she encounters the Voice of God (Alan Rickman) who appears as a flaming, burning-bush type of phenomenon, and promptly uses a fire-extinguisher to put out the flames.<br />--The Hellish Plot--<br />Azrael (Jason Lee), a minor leader of demons, has command of agents to try to stop the Last Scion from stopping the angels. Why? Well, I cannot tell you. This would give away too much of the film. But, suffice it to say, the forces of evil seem to want the angels to prove God wrong (or, at least some of the forces of evil want this). By the way, I am inclined to agree with this demon on at least one point -- central air conditioning is one of the greatest things in creation!<br />--The Prophets--<br />Yes, this being a View Askew production, we could hardly do without a visit from the guys from Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob, who turn out to be the Prophets (actually, perhaps it is spelled 'profits'). Unlikely prophets (as, in fact, most prophets are), but basically good at heart.<br />--The Apostle--<br />Rufus (Chris Rock), the thirteenth apostle (also left out of the Bible, because of his race) appears to the Last Scion and the Prophets to help them in their quest.<br />--The Golden Calf--<br />Loki and Bartelby stop for a moment to pay a visit on a Disney-esque corporation for one last fling as vengeance and destruction angels. The icon of this corporation is a Golden Cow (or Calf), and their crime is encouraging the worshipping of false idols. Hmmmm... Perhaps not all of this movie is so off base.<br />--Seredipity--<br />'You people don't celebrate your religion, you mourn it', she says. Serendipity, once a concept, is now personified (in the actress of Salma Hayek), and joins the quest. She is the one who realises that the bishop's golf club, because it is blessed, is thus holy, and can be used against a demon (another piece of dogmatic finery - hmmm, perhaps I should bless my tennis racket!).<br />--The Conclusion--<br />Bartleby, who had normally been the voice of reason against Loki's brash fire-and-brimstone approach (well, he was the Angel of Death, after all), becomes upset at the efforts being used to stop them, and turns into a Satan-esque figure bent on opposing God.<br />But, where is God? We find out that God is missing (something that many in many religions can relate to much of the time, alas), only to discover that God likes to take the occasional holiday. The angels and the choirs of heaven are worried that Bartleby and Loki will succeed in destroying the universe while God is away from his(her) desk.<br />Oh, ye of little faith. God in the end, in the form of Alanis Morrisette, does show up to save the day, in more ways than one.<br />--The Priestly Commentary--<br />Lots of people were very offended at this film (just as some might be offended by this writing!). It does poke fun (scathing, caustic wit is more like it, in truth) at religion in general, Christianity in specific, and the Roman Catholic church in particular. As a priest, I thought there were some questionable scenes and would have preferred a little less foul language; but overall, I thought the premise and the storyline were creative and inventive. I'm quite surprised, actually, that it became a controversy -- I would never use this film for a catechism class, but my fellow seminarians and I had quite productive discussions talking about the topics brought up in the film.<br />Beware of the language and a few offensive scenes. But make a list of theological questions. See how many theological points that weren't in Charleton Heston films you don't know! We can have a productive discussion later.t Loki's brash fire-and-brimstone approach (well, he was the Angel of Death, after all), becomes upset at the efforts being used to stop them, and turns into a Satan-esque figure bent on opposing God.<br />But, where is God?

B000002UJQ|5.0|now im not gonna get in a stupid argument.. all im gonna say is some people need to do more home work about a band when they buy a record..(aka..the duran duran guy)<BR>   i thought this album was amazing... i originally was not a huge radiohead fan and by buying this album i was slightly stepping out of my hard rock/alternative comfort zone. I had always liked a few of radioheads songs but have not given alot of thought in buying any of there cd's..i think it was the saterday night live preformance that scared me off. then a few years down the road i started getting into more expperimental rock music like tool and modest mouse(yes it is possible to be nerd and a metal head at the same time) anywho i decided to take the plunge and try something new...and in doing so I am delightfully surprised. and this did not take too many listens for me to fall in love with it. i was lulled away by enchanting texturse of the tingling guitars and the crooning vocals.I was also impressed with the creepy almost sci/fi feel that this record radiated with.<BR> i love a good concept album but usually they are a little too long to listen to in one sitting and if u stop one and start it again later, it won't flow as well. but with ok computer radiohead was able to take u on their musical quest in under an hour...i think...i'v never really timed it but it doesn't feel to long to me. anyways i think anybody who is sick of music as usual needs to pick this album out and see what all the hype is about for them selves.
B0000507PC|5.0|I suppose it is inevitable that, to fit a novel into a two-hour period, much of the detail and even significant parts of the story line must be left out. That is certain the case with The Cider House Rules. John Irving's novel had much more character development, naturally (as a book can always reveal the interior lives of characters much more fully than can any theatrical treatment), but I was a bit disappointed that significant plot developments (such as Homer's relationships away from St. Clouds) were left out. So, in this case, do read the book-you'll be glad you did.<br />That disclaimer having been made, I thought that the movie was very good. Michael Caine gave his usual wonderful performance, but I was never quite clear what accent he was trying to effect (being someone with a muddled accent myself, I am not really one to criticise on this point). The stories of the orphans of St. Clouds and the women who came for help in one way or another were very poignant. I was moved at the interplay between compassion and concern-the right to life/abortion debate (perhaps the central ideological pivot point in the novel and the movie) is presented in an interesting way, with just a small tendency to get preachy on one side or the other. To a large extent, this is never really resolved; while Homer in the end realises that in the adult world there are rarely black-and-white issues, but rather shades of gray, one does not know in the movie if he is really persuaded to his mentor's view.<br />The Cider House Rules (referring firstly to the notice tacked to the wall of one of the lodgings) serves as a metaphor for the entire film. Who made these rules? What do they really mean? What purpose do they serve? Can't we make our own rules? I found this metaphor personally meaningful, for, as a theology student, these are questions I ask and am asked on a routine basis. What authority do rules written by others have on me? on society?<br />This story is also one of vocation, of finding one's life's calling, a pursuit near to my heart as I prepare to enter the ministry. I find that my resistance to being pigeon-holed is similar to Homer's. He resisted the automatic assumption that he was a doctor, only to find in the course of his life that he was in fact called to be a doctor. Often when one tries to run away from a vocation, one runs into its arms in any case.<br />The different family situations (Rose and her father, the flyer and his, the orphanage) shows that family and community exist on many different levels. The interactions and easy acceptance of these situations is perhaps a bit of a stretch, but the interplay shows that the traditional nuclear family was more of an ideal than a realisation.<br />I loved the scenery, and the cinematography was very well done, but I have a slight irritation at the depiction of New England as being covered in fall-coloured foliage all year round. New Hampshire is one of my favourite holiday spots, and many is the time that I've been there that, lovely as it is, there was not a red-coloured or gold-coloured tree to be seen.<br />This story essentially is one about love for the unloved, the overall love for humanity, of one making one's way in a confusing world, and trying to protect the vulnerable while allowing them freedom to grow, and an infusing of a sense of worth in those whom the world would otherwise consider worthless, as exemplified in the good doctor's nightly bidding: `Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.'<br />P.S. Watch for John Irving's cameo in the movie, too.finding one's life's calling, a pursuit near to my heart as I prepare to enter the ministry.

B00005J6T1|5.0|This was Madonna's debut and although her sophomore album &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was the one that made her a household name, this album was still very successful and gave her a nice share of hits. Yeah, the songs scream early 80's, but the album is a fun dance LP and a Madonna essential. <br />1. Lucky Star: 5/5 One of my Madonna faves. This version is much better than the version on &quot;The Immaculate Collection.&quot; You need to hear the full song to appreciate it. It hit #4 on the pop charts.<br />2. Borderline: 5/5 This song has taken years to grow on me, but now I love it. A Madonna classic. This hit #10 on the pop charts.<br />3. Burning Up: 5/5 A dance hit for Madonna. Although it's a great track, it's one of M's most underrated singles.<br />4. I Know It: 5/5 The intro sounds like the theme from some bad 80's action flick, but it's a cool song with an edgy chorus.<br />5. Holiday: 3/5 This is definitely a Madonna classic, but I've never cared for it. It's very recognizable but the other songs on here are better. A top 20 pop hit. <br />6. Think of Me: 4/5 A good dance track...nothing outstanding. <br />7. Physical Attraction: 4/5 Ditto to #6.<br />8. Everybody: 4/5 Madonna's first single was a hit in the dance clubs. It has a fun chorus and is pretty darn catchy.<br />On the remastered version, there are also two bonus mixes of &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Burning Up.&quot; A highly recommended album. All big Madonna fans should get this whether you have the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; or not. The remastered, extended versions are better. :)
B00003CXA2|5.0|I went in to this movie not knowing what to expect.  I kinda thought it was going to be boring.  I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be so good!<br />I've watched it several times now since I bought the DVD, and every time I notice a little something more.  I love how they used the special effects to make Forrest meet some famous people of the past.<br />I bought in to every part of the storyline, except where he runs across the country for years.  I don't know why - I could buy in to everything else but that.<br />Overall I thought the story was touching, well-written and well acted.  Every actor was perfect for the role they played, especially loved Tom Hanks as Forrest and Sally Field as his mother.  I watched it recently and just realized that Haley Joel Osment played Forrest Jr!<br />Anyways, very awesome movie.  And the DVD is absolutely loaded with special features.  Well worth the money, IMHO!
0838577016|4.0|Kandel's monumental 4th Edition text is chock-full of updated figures, pictures, and descritive mechanisms within its 9 parts.<br />This textbook would function extremely well as the primary resource for an intermediate-level Neuroscience course (graduate school).<br />It is well-organized and adequately referenced.  The histological figures, MRI scans, and related clinical measures are especially impressive and helpful for supporting the information presented in the text.<br />This textbook does a fine job with balancing basic information with highly technical concepts.  However, and understandably so, due to the voluminous, ever-expanding and ever-evolving nature of neural science, the text does not contain much regarding synaptic plasticity nor circadian rhythms.<br />That said, I still think this textbook is one of the most valuable tools that you could include in your academic armamentarium.
0142004235|3.0|\\"East of Eden\\" is a good book, however it is a bit on the tedious side.  After a time, the plight of Adam Trask seems pathetic, and you start to not care about his outcome.  Samuel Hamliton is a strong force in the book, which is lost at his death.  The most interesting characters were, in my opinion, Charles, the brother of Adam Trask, who we do not hear from in the later part of the book, and Cathy/Kate.  Cathy's emotional detachment makes her dangerous and interesting, as she makes a life for herself.  <br />Ultimtely, I am pleased that I stuck with the book, but I would recommend Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"  Both of these novels are not such a chore to read.
B00001IVOR|4.0|The nine swordsmen from Shaolin are back with there sophomore LP titled Wu-Tang Forever. The RZA is considered to be one of the best at producing hot beats and tracks like \\"Reunited\\", \\"Triumph\\" and \\"Its Yourz\\" prove it. But they wouldnt be half as hot if the lyrical ninjas didnt kill each track spitting bar after bar of pure genius. The ones that stand out the most are GZA, Tical and of course Ghost & Rae. If you are a rap fan then you should cop this album. Cause if u ain't got Wu in your stereo then you aint bumping the right stuff.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I never heard a Radiohead song before but bought this CD cause of all the reviews on here.  I just got done listening to it for the first time and I was in such awe when it was over that I couldn't manage to move for several minutes.  It's as good (and better) than everyone says it is!
B00008IXAR|5.0|Absolutely awesome.  I bought the CD a few weeks ago and I  can't stop listening to it.  After \\"Love and the Russian Winter\\", I found myself missing the flavor of earlier albums like \\"Picture Book\\" and \\"A New Flame\\".  The good news is, Mick Hucknall's back and as great as ever.  (As are all the other SR band members.)  Every track is gorgeous and the variety of songs is perfect.  \\"Sunrise\\" is definitely a favorite, as is \\"Fake.\\"  I was a little surprised to hear \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\"-but Mick pulled it off charmingly.  A definite must for any SR fan.
B00006RG9K|5.0|having received recently both &quot;the wall&quot; and this dvd i will conclude both are amazing dvd and are &quot;must have&quot; dvd.<BR>i simply regret that this dvd has not the same 5.1 quality of mixing than &quot;the wall &quot;<BR>Sound is superb nevertheless
B000089RVX|5.0|Like everyone else, I first heard Bring Me to Life on the radio.  At first, I thought it catchy, then I found myself channel-surfing just to hear that song again.  Still, I did not buy the CD (in case that was the only good song) until I heard Going Under.  I immediately ran out and bought the CD and popped it in.  Initially, I was only really interested in those first two tracks, but eventually found myself humming some of the other tunes at really odd moments (like in the middle of a meeting).  Some of the angst gets a little repetative (the words &quot;hollow,&quot; &quot;pain,&quot; &quot;bleeding,&quot; and &quot;betray&quot; are a bit overused), but the discordant melodies and driving guitar are a truly powerful combination.  Now, I'd have to say I'm pretty much obsessed with the whole CD - and am in fact listening to it right now.  I carry the CD with me everywhere I go and play it whenever I get a chance.  I haven't been this taken with a band since I heard POE's &quot;Haunted.&quot;
B00000272N|4.0|\\"Facelift\\" was Alice in Chains' debut album.  It's surprising to listen to it now, thirteen years later, and realize how much of their music does not appear dated and has held up.<br />Most people have mentioned the strong first half of this release, which features \\"Love, Hate, Love,\\" \\"Man in the Box,\\" \\"Sea of Sorrow,\\" \\"We Die Young,\\" and \\"It Ain't Like That.\\"  All of these songs are good; most people fail to realize just how good, as \\"Man in the Box\\" is satirical and serious at the same time, as it talks about the problems Staley, Cantrell and the others have with people's expectations, and how frustrating it is to deal with.  Several other songs have similar overtones, which add to the despair and anger in unusual ways to show unexpected depth.<br />I think the second half is equally as powerful as the first, although it's not exactly in the same style as the first half.  The above songs could have been called hard rock, with metal overtones.  The last songs are in a more eclectic style, thus harder to pin down; really, these later songs show the diversity AIC was capable of, as they have hints of many other styles (including country, folk, rock, and blues) than hard rock, metal, or the nascent \\"grunge\\" style that AIC was identified with, yet never truly played.<br />My personal favorites on the last half are \\"Confusion\\" and \\"Real Thing.\\"  \\"Real Thing\\" is another satirical look at rehab and the problems with it; if Staley was talking about himself, this is an incredibly revalatory song, as he basically is talking about trying to get out of rehab to score more drugs, and talks about trying to fool them to borrow $50 to aid in that.  \\"Confusion\\" is self-explanatory; the chorus goes, \\"Love, Sex, Pain, Confusion, Suffering,\\" and it was obvious this was how Staley was feeling at the time.  The vocals are painfully pure, and the background was just enough to set them off with style.<br />The only reason this album does not get five stars from me is because there isn't as much vocal harmony on this album as there are on later efforts, such as the 1992 EP \\"Sap\\" and especially the 1993 EP \\"Jar of Flies.\\"  Even 1995's self-titled release (also sometimes called \\"Tripod\\") had more vocal harmony than this one, and considering that was one of the hallmark's of AIC's mature style . . . well, AIC wasn't quite mature here, I guess.  Which is why there is less vocal harmony here than on later albums.<br />So, my final tally is 4.5 stars, recommended.
B00005QDW1|1.0|What a low for the music scene. Right next to Missy Elliot and Cannibal Corpse. A pretty good ska band ditches it all and goes mainstream. Fine. Then, seven years later, they come back with an album of cliche, repetitive, choruses, RAP, cheesy dance beats, no talent, and a singer with sickeningly blonde hair and a voice to match. What happened to &quot;Trapped In A Box?&quot;<br />Instead, we get: &quot;Hey baby, hey baby, yeah.&quot; and &quot;I'm feeling hella good, let's just keep on dancing.&quot;<br />Kids, listen to Bob Marley. I'm outta here to do just that.
B000002B2X|4.0|&quot;Sap&quot; is unusual for Alice in Chains, in that it has only four official songs, &quot;Brother,&quot; &quot;Got me Wrong,&quot; &quot;Right Turn,&quot; and &quot;Am I Inside.&quot;  It's also unusual in that it features Ann Wilson from Heart and Chris Cornell from Soundgarden (among others); these were (and are) other Seattle-based musicians who believed in AIC, believed in how good they might turn out to be (as they'd only released one full length album previous to this, &quot;Facelift&quot;), and wished to make music with them.<br />Basically, I'd give 5 stars to both &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Got Me Wrong,&quot; because they are slower than most AIC, but are still extremely powerful.  &quot;Brother&quot; is about child abuse; &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; is about relationship problems.  I'd give 4 1/2 stars for &quot;Right Turn,&quot; as I really like Chris Cornell's contribution here (this song is almost impossible to describe).  And I'd give 3 stars for &quot;Am I inside,&quot; because although I love the beginning and most of the singing, I still am unsure what this song means -- and I've listened to it over 100 times.<br />The fifth song is untitled; it's more of a demented jam session. I've heard it called &quot;Love Song.&quot;  I wonder what had just happened to Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell, if so?  They must have had tremendously bad experiences right before recording this, as it's the darkest and most depressing song they ever did -- full of distortion, overdubs, intentional feedback, and lacking any sense of vocal harmony _or_ vocal power.  I'd give this song a 1 1/2.<br />Anyway, because most of the songs are very good, I've rounded up, and give this CD a solid four stars.  Basically, if you like AIC, especially if you like the &quot;softer&quot; side of AIC as evidenced by &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; and &quot;AIC MTV Unplugged,&quot; you will like this CD.
B00004R99F|5.0|This movie kicked serious booty! It may not seem as good as it looks- but to me it was worth my while. Great character design, great animation, great storyline and very real in the way each generation is bizarrely different! I never liked goofy until i saw this movie. Max, Goofy's son, was clearly my favorite. Some of the road trip stops made me fall over laughing, and the climax/ outcomes of the movie were very unpredictable! I actually enjoyed the characters in the movie! Kids, teens and adults will like this movie. I liked it, and being a teenager myself, I don't feel embarrassed to comment the movie- I watched it when I was little, and now i watched it recently- honestly not expecting much- but i liked it! I enjoyed it so much I gave it 5 stars. The songs are slightly out of whack but I liked it all in all. Try it out!
B00005JKN9|4.0|I almost said it. About 2/3rd's of the way through Gangs of New York, I almost said \\"this is the best film Scorcese has EVER done.\\" But, I waited and alas the last 45 minutes proved me wrong. Hey, 4 stars is no small accomplishment and Gangs of New York is an excellent film, but not a great one. Out of the many reasons I could site for this picture being a resounding success, there is only one that matters: Daniel Day-Lewis. I could not stop thinking during the duration of this film how Daniel Day-Lewis was ROBBED of an Oscar this past year. Not only was his performance as Bill The Butcher great, but it will be remembered for years to come as one of the best roles ever played on film. It's not just the accent (which is cool) or the brutality (which is apparent) but the torment of this man's soul that you feel with every inhumane act he commits. Every other character in Gangs of New York stand as ants in comparison to Lewis' Butcher. Leonardo DiCaprio is less than adequate he cannot pull of the toughness needed of this role, he's too much of a pretty boy and this film ain't pretty. Cameron Diaz does a good job as a local thief and object of all mens' affection in the Five Points. Liam Neeson makes a brief but powerful appearance in the beginning of the film as Leo's dad, whom the film is largely centered around. The first 2 hours of Gangs is mesmerizing, fast-paced and intriguing. The Gangs are the main fodder. But as we near the end, Scorcese does not give us the ultimate payoff that we have so patiently waited for. Instead he chooses to push the central story to the backburner and shove down our throats the Civil War Draft Enaction and the violence that followed it's inception. Overall, Gangs of New York is a success in every sense of the word. It is certainly worth owning just for Daniel Day-Lewis' performance alone. But, Goodfellas still reigns atop my list of Scorcese films. Highly Recommended.

I was so disappointed after Timeline, I shall be more circumspect about buying his books in future. One thought comes to mind - was it really written by MC? What a waste of 10.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Without Will Ferrell, Old School would have been as funny as Ishtar. Ferrell plays Frank, a 30 year old regular guy. He likes his suped-up red Firebird, blasting Whitesnake and getting totally liquored-up every chance he gets. But, now that he's recently married his persona has changed a bit. Can you say P-Whipped? Anyway, Frank's best buddy, Mitch is just coming out of a relationship and his friend Bernard (Vaughn) rents him out a house almost directly on campus at Harriman University. Right off the bat the boys throw Mitch-a-palooza, a huge party with Snoop Dogg as the entertainment. Frank starts doing funnels and quickly assumes his old Frank the Tank persona again by streaking through the quad. There are so many funny parts in Old School but they are all directly linked to Ferrell. Luke Wilson plays the voice of reason but it isn't heard too much during Old School. Vince Vaughan is really funny as Bernard who is worth about 3 Million (that the Government knows about) by owning a chain of Speaker City stores. I'm not really sure why this was \\"Unrated\\" because there are only one or two nude scenes and one really raunchy scene with Andy Dick. But overall, Old School is a great addition to any self respecting comedy fan's DVD library. Highly Recommended.
B000066NW0|5.0|I'm in my 30's and I love this CD.  I rarely buy music these days due to my busy lifestyle, but I liked all the songs I heard by Avril on the radio and wanted to hear more, so I bought the CD.  I was surprised to love every single song!  I've had this CD in my player for a month now and I'm still not sick of it.  I don't know much about Avril as a person.  I never heard/knew of her songs as being punk, but they certainly are not.  I was however, disappointed when I heard her sing on SNL on 7/5/03.  Her voice sounded horrible, but on the CD it is outstanding.  I hope she just had a bad singing day and that her voice on the CD wasn't doctored to sound good because that would most likely mean a short career and few, if any, future CDs.  If she does come out with another CD, I will definitely buy it because the songs and her voice on the CD are awesome!
0441172717|5.0|Without a doubt Dune is one of the strongest sci-fi books I have ever read.  Infact, I should have read it sooner.  The book was written way before I was born but it is only when someone presented it to me as a gift that I decided to read it.  I believed that after seeing the movie adaptation by David Lynch the book will not be as interesting.  I was wrong.  <BR>In addition, I have played every computer game in the Dune series.  After reading the book I have noticed some subtle roots of computer game story and design I have not noticed before.<BR>Without contemplating any longer, I went out and bought the two sequels.  I can't wait to finish them.  There is something amazing about Frank Herbert's writing.  It is so rich, so deep, so dense with thought that I find it to be a jewel among thoughtless sci-fi of today.  Dune was written in sixties but it still blows away the sci-fi world of today.
B00005B6N8|4.0|There are plenty of good, action packed sci-fi thrillers out there, correct? But how many of them can you say have the newest twist that screenwriter David Twohy has brought to the screen? Not a visible one, mind you. Perceptiveness is key in finding it - unlike most of the movies in this genre, the chracters have depth, there are new fear-invoking concepts being used, and new effects employed to bring about a new light on the sci-fi thriller genre.<br />Riddick (Vin Diesel) deals with all types of emotion, well shown through Diesel's control of his expressions. In certain scenes, we can see this ex-con, murderer, and freak sideshow (with his shine job, what else could he be?) deal with frustration, restraint, and even - dare I say it - fear. Fry (Radha Mitchell) knows throughout the movie that she is guilty of trying to kill the passengers, yet overcoming this guilt is necessary for her ultimate sacrifice to save the other survivors. And of course, Johns deals with addiction the easy way - by giving into it - and tries his hand at manipulation: sometimes, he does succeed, but overall he's just another fool in the daily grind.<br />As well as using his deep knowledge of characterizations to bring new meaning to Pitch Black, Twohy uses an untapped source for the 'scary' elements of the film. Throughout the picture, the creatures are hardly ever seen in a normal camera light and view. Why? It's the same concept as the monster-under-the-bed, or the 'Tooth Fairy' from Darkness Falls. By not seeing what one is really afraid of, there is psychologically more fear is invoked in the person's mind. <br />The final element that brings new light to this close-to-generic plot is exactly that- the lighting. How many other movies have entire segmants set in a bluelight, or an orangey tint? Not many, I'd say. The different colored segments show many things - even the mindset of the characters. Using charts describing emotions invoked by color, one can reasonably say that the bluelight was used while the characters were calm and sure of their motion. They were still confident that they'd all come out of the accident alive. By the time the color swithed over to the orange tint, some of the survivors were dead, and calmness had led to fury over the fact that death was nearly inevitable for some. And, of course, when the time came that the entire planet was shrouded in the black, fear had settled into the hearts of everyone still breathing.<br />Overall, the movie was slightly predictable, with a few different effects than most in this genre. The ending deals completely with emotion, with a bit of psychological revenge and a mix of untapped resources. I'd reccommend this movie, if only for the reason that it's not the generic thriller, but one with a fresh new outlook.<br />-star of light-
0783226063|5.0|I read the book and have seen the movie.  All I have to say that I love them both.  Considering the abstract approach of the movie towards its subject matter public's general negative reaction seems inexorable.  There is not much market for very abstract films today. <br />As far as Dune goes I think that it would be difficult to make a better movie adaptation then what Lynch created.  Somehow he captured the lonely atmosphere of the desert, the vehement nature of Freemen, and the brutality of the conflicts between Atreides and Harkonnen.  The worms were awesome!  Without a doubt the original book by Herbert is brilliant, and the movie adaptation is in no way a failure at capturing the potency of potential. <br />I think in fact that some parts of the movie were even better done than what was featured in the book.  For example, when Paul joins Freemen in the film he teaches them how to use sound weapons, specialty of Atreides.  In the book however, Paul only taught Freemen to fight differently.  I'm sorry to say, but hand-to-hand combat superiority is rarely a determinant of large-scale warfare.  Lynch introduced a new twist.  He attributed Freemen newfound strength to sound weapons, which was even better than what Herbert did.  This is only one of the little tweaks we find in the film, but it is the one that shows how the movie improved and not underdone its source material. <br />Another strong feature of the film was the cast.  The characters were believable and well portrayed.  Unlike in the book, Harkonnen, especially the Baron, seemed like a family out of the mental institution.  This twist however, was interesting in that it made enemies of Atreides appear more evil, more cruel and more threatening.<br />Overall, Dune is one of my all time favorite sci-fi movies equated only by few titles such as the Matrix series.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This film is where Audrey got her start in Hollywood stardom.Anyone whoever sees this movie is captivated by her good looks and perfect manners.She is the perfect girl to take home to mother.Gregory Peck does a fantastic job in this film, and was so impressed with Audrey,he told Paramount Films to give her top billing along with his name.I can see why.I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who has never seen Audrey Hepburn.
B00003CWPL|5.0|It came out a few months ago, and man is it a sweet print.  All original aspect ratio, all cleaned up frame by frame by david lynch himself...Hey Lynch, I hate corporations too, but by releasing them with a major label they will be fully accessible to the general public (such as the very fine Blue Velvet Special editon DVD and the Twin peaks first season DVD), and thus you only come off as a snobby elitist.  Judging by the slick, masturbatory, desperate attempt to keep up with the hip, artsy film scenesters that was Mullholland Drive, I guess that comes as no surprise.  But Lynch's Chodiosity will not ruin Eraserhead for me, even if it doesn't have the deleted scenes.<br />NOODLEZ 4 EVR<br />PEAS<br />ps.  tha sound iz BUMP
B00009V7RF|1.0|This is perhaps the worst rap group ever. The song &quot;Where is the Love&quot; is the worst song/video i have ever heard/seen in my life.  I think its completly disgraceful and disrespectful about how they refer to the CIA as terrorists.  They have obviously no IQ what so ever. Im also not down with the whole guy singing like a girl thing(Justin Timberlake). Anyone who breaks up with Britney Spears has no IQ either. You know your career is over when your singing duets with The Black Eyed Pee's. Elephunk is also the worst name for an Album. I would never waste my money on an album called Elephunk...even if it was the name of 50 cents album. THE CIA IN NO WAY ARE TERRORISTS. THESE GUYS ALONG WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE SHOULD BE DEPORTED
0385504209|5.0|This is simply one the best books I've ever read and it has become one of my favorites.<br />Once I began reading this extraordinary book, I could not put it down. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; has extraordinary descriptions of places and characters. As soon as I began reading this book I was inside a wonderful world of increasing intrigue and mystery. This book even encouraged me to do my own research about Da Vinci's life and about the places and paintings described. This is a book I'll never forget.
B00005JKZU|5.0|I have seen many things in the past and by far, I belive this will become a classic... scracth that; it already is!

I can't wait! I really loved this movie, and if anyone else doesn't, you seriously have problems.

0425173895|5.0|After reading &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, I can see why Agatha Christie is one of the greatest mystery writers to have ever lived.  This book is written through the eyes of Dr. James Sheppard, who has been called when his patient, Roger Ackroyd, is murdered.  Dr. Sheppard has recently lost a patient named Mrs. Ferrars who was engaged to the deceased.  Before her death, <BR>she confided some personal information to Dr. Sheppard which gave him an inside track on the identity of the murderer.  The victim's adopted son Roger, seems like a likely suspect, so his fiance Flora hires a retired detective, Hercule Poirot, to find the real killer.  In his precise and logical way, Poirot does just that, uncovering the truth bit by bit as he interviews the possible suspects.  They are all present--the family members who stand to gain financially from Ackroyd's death, the butler, the efficient private secretary, the housekeeper, the parlor maid, and a mysterious stranger.  Only one of them is guilty and Poirot works his magic in this cleverly convoluted story.  It is amazing to see that this book was written in 1926 and it is just as interesting today as it was almost 80 years ago.

B000002AVF|4.0|This is her best album during her time with Tommy Motolla. Her previous albums may have had a few better individual songs but as a complete album, &quot;Daydream&quot; delivers. It has the played out hits &quot;Fantasy&quot; (which I still enjoy) and &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; (nice song but sick of hearing it), but I found more pleasure in the understated &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot; and the ballad remake &quot;Open Arms&quot;. She doesn't overdo the vocal gymnastics here and this is before she drenched all of her songs with that falsetto (or whatever it's called) like what she did on &quot;Through the Rain&quot;. No fillers here though one or two songs come close to being labelled bland. Otherwise, &quot;Daydream&quot; is great for all ages.
0553062182|3.0|I think that the reader from South Texas has some serious anger issues and should spend some time working on those before condemning the author. Maybe he/she should try some meditation, (or medication) to help get in touch with their inner-self!
B000002BE9|5.0|Yeah she might be a little moody in public but that energy works in her music. &quot;Tidal&quot; is a bit more mellow and serious than her second album &quot;When the Pawn&quot; but somehow it makes it more intriguing also. This album grows on you as one attempts to decipher her lyrics' meaning and get drawn in by the emotion of her voice and piano. My favorite songs are the reminiscing sound &quot;Pale September&quot;, jazzy &quot;Slow Like Honey&quot;, the tempo-switching &quot;Carrion&quot;, and the singles &quot;Never is a Promise&quot;, &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; and &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot;. Strangely, I found her biggest hit &quot;Criminal&quot; to be the least memorable so don't base your buying decision on what you've heard on the radio. I bought this back in '98 and still enjoy it today 5 years later.
B00005K3LW|4.0|Die Hard With a Vengeance reunites actor Bruce Willis and director John McTiernan for a second sequel to their 1988 mega-thriller Die Hard.  Adapted from a non-Die Hard script titled Simon Says by screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh, this third chapter in the John McClane saga is more offbeat and just a bit darker than expected.<br />Although it still follows the Die Hard formula - and how could it not? - of McClane versus formidable obstacles, Die Hard 3 wisely avoids the Christmas Crises scenarios from the first two films.  Gone also (although the movie never really explains why) is Bonnie Bedelia's Holly, although she is mentioned in several scenes.  Apparently McClane never adjusted to life in Los Angeles and returned to his job in the New York Police Department.<br />So when a bomb goes off at a Bonwit Teller store in Manhattan, it is providential for the Big Apple that McClane is a lieutenant in New York's Finest, albeit a depressed and beer-swilling lieutenant.  Providential because we know that when arch-villain \\"Simon\\" (Jeremy Irons) demands that McClane participate in a potentially deadly version of the game \\"Simon Says,\\"  our Everyman hero will rise to the occasion and thwart Simon's deadly scheme.<br />As in the first Die Hard film, McTiernan pairs McClane with an interesting partner.  Where in the 1988 flick Willis was helped by Reginald Veljohnson (better known as Carl from Family Matters), in Die Hard with a Vengeance his charismatic and reluctant partner is played by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Star Wars Episodes I and II).  Their \\"unlikely buddies\\" routine is energetic and witty, and Jackson plays his Harlem store owner character with a mixture of biting wit, bewilderment, and even dignity.<br />The Special Edition 2-disc set, like the previous two in the series, contains the movie on Disc 1 with interactive menus,  anamorphic Widescreen presentation, various audio and subtitle options, and commentary by director McTiernan and screenwriter Hensleigh.  Disc 2, of course, has the usual theatrical trailer and TV spots, several TV \\"making of\\" specials, a special-effects breakdown, and an interview with Bruce Willis.gh.

B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna finally loses it with this terrible CD. This album is pure [foul language] and doesn't even deserve to exist. The title track isn't even music!

B00005OCMR|5.0|This DVD is a must for Scifi fans of all ages. There've been some scifi movies that will never stand up to the test of time due to advanced special effects but this is not going to happen to Tron. Even today the movie still rocks. Yes..the scenes at the beginning in the arcades are dated but the world of Tron is amazingly created. AND...Tron 2.0 is in the works (game, movie, who cares). Picking this up is a sure thing for a good time.

0142004235|5.0|As a little girl in Denmark, I read it for the first time and fell in love with the Salinas Valley and the people who settled there.  Later, I visited Salinas and the Steinbeck museum.  The book, which I re-read regularly, had a big impact on my life - and the story of the origin of the word 'timshel' is fascinating and riveting.  The discussions among Adam, Sam Hamilton, and Lee are my favorite scenes of the book.  Steinbeck will always be close to my heart.... Kirsten Weinoldt
1400034779|3.0|Mma Ramotswe has just inherited money from her father.  Instead of buying a traditional business like he wanted, she decides to start her own, the only detective agency in Botswana owned by a woman.  Her clients are slow in coming, but soon she is developing a business finding lost husbands, tracking the secret lives of daughters, and looking for a kidnapped boy.<br />This book is really a literary novel not a mystery novel, which is what I expected when I started to read it.  Most of the cases are solved in one chapter.  We get several chapters of the main character's back story before the agency is even opened.  When I was reading it as a literary book, I could get into it.  If I tried thinking of it as a mystery, I was disappointed.<br />Precious Ramotswe herself is a bit unbelievable.  She was just starting out, yet did a perfect job on every case.  Where were her flaws?<br />Finally, it really seemed like a feminist book.  Almost all the men in the book were the scum of the earth.  While I will admit that some men are, I'd like to think I can name some that aren't (starting with me.)  I have no problem with gutsy, independent women, but the overall tone just seemed to be anti-man.  Ironic, since the book was written by a man.<br />Judging by the success of these books, I'm in the minority in my opinion.  It was an ok read, but certainly not something I'm crazy about and wasn't enjoyable enough to make me want to read the other books in this series.
B000002KB8|4.0|This album truly defines the foetal stages of what is now defined as &quot;heavy metal&quot;, although it's only rock and roll. &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; is truly a graphic novel, if you will, of the Sab.

0800141849|1.0|This is one unintentionally hilarious vanity project.  But what I want to say is that one of the other viewers wondered what became of the boom mike he saw hanging in several scenes when he saw the movie in a theater.  Well, just about all movie prints have mikes in them.  It's the projectionist's job to position the film properly in the projector to keep the &quot;extras&quot; out of sight.  If the viewer had seen the movie in another theater, he might have seen that no mike was visible.  Anyway, there's no mike in the DVD, but maybe it would have helped to have one.
0800177363|5.0|I was in high school when i first saw this film while unwinding myself one evening from a school work. It was in a free tv channel in our local area that when i first saw this moving flick. Then years have passed, I bought this film straight from the video shop near in our place...from then, it became one of my favorite films for all-time.<br />'Awakenings' is a story of hope, survival, and triumph of human spirit amidst of uncertainties in the fields of science and health. Two of the most notable and brilliant actors in their own right (and at the same time, included in my lists of favorite actors)...Robin Williams and Robert de Niro surfaces their award-winning performances in this film. Dr. Sayer magnificently played by Robin Williams which I truly commend him for being a versatile actor...not just a comedian but an actor whose different portrayals in his different movies gave an astounding performances with better execution. We saw Robin Williams played also as a doctor in 'Patch Adams' which is more humorous and spirited act but not in 'Awakenings' which branded more on a serious tone and in a sense 'geek' doctor. Nevertheless, he fairly overcome his pathetic character to become extreme but turning to a mild one. <br />In Robert De niro's character as Leonard Lowe, who was contracted with a forgotten illness of 1920's did a great performance. It is likely believable for De Niro's part to be in this character as a patient of this illness. I was moved by his credible act for this movie.<br />Penny Marshall should also be credited for a wonderful and moving performances of her actors and of course her unique directing gave way the very heart of this film. <br />The film was dealing with an incurable disease of the 1920s which existed until the 1960's with no medicines that are able to cure them but Dr.Sayer tried to dare himself by experimenting with drugs that can cure basically Parkinson's disease and which is so uncertain also if it cures the disease that Leonard and others has. But lo, everybody 'awakened' from their long sleep. Leonard and the others experienced a short 'awakenings' in their life that particular summer but not for long...the disease came back and no matter how the drugs (that cured them before) prevent this, it is useless. Although the film deals with this disease there is something more incurable disease that revolves around the story or much more, it is the worse disease that humanity have ever contracted...the disease of indifference... <br />Sayer was right in saying 'We are faced with incurable disease...that is indifference'...The film doesn't focus only on that particular disease but the the disease of indifference also. What makes life more simpler and happier that one cannot find in the facts of science and medicine? That is love and compassion...that makes life so simpler and yet so fulfilling. The joys of life that one can attain and live fully is given by the people we loved dearly and loved us and through this love one can cure the disease of indifference. 'Awakenings' speaks about this...<br />I definitely recommend this to everyone...of all ages. So that you can find cure by giving your total and unconditioned love for your family and friends as well as others...
B00008DDXC|2.0|This is the popular movie version of the second Harry Potter book.  Once again, popularity and quality are not related.  This movie has all of the flaws of the book (almost too many to count).  The major ones are:<BR>Ron Weasly breaks his wand.  It is a hand-me-down.  But we know that wands choose their owners and a wizard should never use someone else's wand.<BR>Magic users are completely ignorant of the muggle world.  One student cannot conceive of a poster where the pictures don't move.  Students have never heard of basketball.  Ron's dad works for the Ministry of Magic and yet is clueless as to how a bus stop works (and he works in London). (etc. etc.).<BR>Muggles are not to learn that magic exists.  Hermione's parents visit Diaganon alley and they are both muggles.  How do they know their daughter is a witch?  How does any mixed parentage work if letting muggles know about magic is a horrible crime?<BR>Apparently it is illegal to enchant anything that is of muggle origin.  I would love to know the &quot;magical origins&quot; of all of the objects populating the book.<BR>The defense for the dark arts teacher is a complete buffoon and yet the wise heads of Hogwarts are completely fooled.<BR>Hagrid has been wronged for many years (is he really 62?) and yet when his name is cleared there are no reparations or apologies.<BR>Hogwarts is a center of magic but not the only place magic is done and yet they don't seem to be able to get a hold of any mandrake (there is no evidence that they even tried).<BR>I still have been unable to figure out money in this world.  There is magical money, of which Harry has hordes, but it doesn't really seem to be good for anything (although the Weaslys don't have enough).  Harry stays with the Weaslys but never offers any help.  Muggle money is for muggles and Harry has none.  What is the magic money for (other than school supplies?).  We'll have to see how Rowling settles that (although I doubt she will).<br />Some changes were made tothe plot in the first movie and I was curious how they would get resolved in this one.  they weren't.  Bad boy Malfoy has bought his way onto his house's Quiddich team by getting everyone new brooms.  Since a seeker is the most important player (the only one who can win a game) it seems unlikely that one can buy into that particular spot.  but wait!  Malfoy is already on the team and already a seeker (see the first movie).  It was a big deal that first year Potter was on the team and a seeker, but no big deal was made that first year Malfoy was on a team and a seeker.  Now we are just confused.  Did Malfoy buy his way onto the team as the new seeker in year two or was he already a seeker in year one?<BR>I know special effects artists can get carried away with their craft but the sheer number of spiders in the woods is completely implausible.  There would be nothing but spiders.  They would have eaten all of the other inhabitants is there were as many as the movie shows.<BR>But, mistakes aside, people like this film, or at least spent a lot of money on it.  No long novel can be fully made into a single movie, but it seemed like the choice of scenes to include was almost random.  One should really not waste one's time on this.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The boys did what I thought was unthinkable. They made a freaky &quot;out there&quot; record and pleased both the pre-OK Computer camp as well as the post-Kid A electronicas. What a way to stay in the mainstream, stay popular, sell records boys. You're big stars, you'll really go far, have a cigar. By the way, which one's Radio? This album is Kid A/Amnesiac kissing OK Computer/The Bends. Some ripping guitar but not too much. Some electronic freaky sound effects but not too much. The usual quasi-cool cryptic lyrics. Did anyone know The Gloaming was about [to quote Thom Yorke] &quot;...the rise of the right wing...&quot; Wow! Heavy lyrics dude! A definite must buy for all certified lemmings.

B0000028RR|5.0|When I first saw the movie 'The Crow' I was totally blown away by it. seeing that it had two of my favorite bands on the soundtrack (Pantera and Nine Inch Nails) I had to have it. While listening to it I noticed a track entitled 'Genocide' by Rage Against the Machine. It was a bizarre track that had to of been one of the very first songs Rage had every recorded seeing that his voice sounded a little different, though you could obivously tell it was Zach. I believe this was the first time the public had been introduced to what is now known as rap/metal (or whatever you or anybody wants to call it, just rock music with rap and hip-hop mixed in with it, okay!). I never really seemed to point the song out, but I wouldn't stop it from playing either. I was confused. So seeing as I was really young and didn't really, at the time, delve into music as much as I should of, I realized that my brother went out and bought the Rage CD right when it came out. We weren't really enthusiastic about the band, just interested. While we listened to the album, our confusion grew. It was something that just could NOT be categorized and we weren't used to something like that, being as young as we were. But as we listened to it more and more the album grew and grew on us. Now anyone who listens to it understands where its coming from, but you have to understand that right when it came out, nobody understood it and there was nothing out there like it so in essents it was and is extremely revolutionary. This cd is not on my top 5 list or even top 10 list, IT IS NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST BY FAR!!! <br />One thing that I hate is how critics believe older bands are the best bands just because they are older and bands who have someone who died in them are more important. I love Nirvana, but why does everyone begin to like them more when Kurt killed himself, its totally ridiculous. What about Sublime, a band that actually had something uniquely good going on, and the singer didn't kill himself, he overdosed, and even if some people believe he killed himself by overdosing well thats stupid because he said that he did it for his albums, which a lot of artist do, it was just unfortunate he had to die. <br />Rage was as good or better than Led Zeppelin (I'm sorry, I love Zeppelin but this is very true) this CD proves it. Maybe not their other CDs but this one definately proves me right. I recently bought the Led Zeppelin DVD with 5 1/2 hours of live performance footage (no interviews, documenteries, or extras at all) and it shows them in their prime (1970) with all of their unique type of music. I was blown away because I was used to the Zeppelin that is commercialized and on the radio, but I literally felt the same as when I listened to this Rage CD for the first time. Odd as it first was, it should be legendary.<br />Rage Against The Machine makes other music today look really bad.

B00008DDXC|5.0|The movie, is fun and exciting, as is to be expected. Although both this movie and its predicessors are perhaps so much like the books that a certain amount of creativity or freedom seems lost to the movie's director and producer. This detracts little for the true Harry Potter enthusiest.
6304712936|5.0|This film is as much a masterpiece of filmmaking genius as a Mozart sonata is a masterpiece of musical genius. <br />F. Murray Abraham as Mozart's arch-enemy Antonio Salieri is what makes this movie work. Peter Shaffer, in adapting his brilliant script to a screenplay, maintained the position of Salieri as semi-narrator, leading the audience down the path of his obsession. We hear the music as Salieri hears it, hear Mozart's annoying, maddening, whinnying laugh as only Salieri can. The film has a bit of Fatal Attraction in it.... Salieri loves and despises Mozart's music and genius. He wants to both kill and *be* Mozart. Not being able to do either, he is a failure in his own mind as a model of mediocrity and impotence. Abraham is pitiable and abhorent. What he wishes to do is so much more hateful than what he does, that what we most despise is his inability to achieve any of his dreams...but we also pity him for it. He is not a villian, he is merely a mortal beside Mozart: \\"God's instrument\\"...the \\"magic flute\\".<br />Tom Hulce, as Mozart, delivers an amazing portrayal of a genius that makes you care for, sympathize with, and admire Mozart as a person, while also truly maddening you with his childishness and idiosyncracies until you dislike him just as much as Salieri does. His dual portrait is true and lifelike.<br />The marriage of Mozart's music to this film is utterly amazing and complete. One could truly not exist without the other. Unlike other bio-films of great composers, the music is not offered in supplement to the story, as if to give the audience a taste of the composer's style, but instead it IS the story, pulling you and directing you onward to the next scene or event.<br />Amadeus is, in short, a beautiful film of genius, obsession, betrayal, revenge and glorious-soaring-immortal music that you must see.
0345457684|5.0|This is a really cool cyberpunk, detective novel. Much better than William Gibson's Neuromancer which many feel is the definitive cyberpunk. I like it because it does not try to be some great philosophical work as neuromancer was and does not stray from the action so much. It has really great language and as all great sci-fi leads you into questions of philosophy rather than shoving them down your throat. <BR>The core idea is so fundamentally new and amazing that it will really provoke your imagination and entrhall you.<BR>It is raunchy, quick, stylish and slick. The reader will really identify with the protagonist, who is as badass a character as has been written in modern detective stories. Watch for this to become a series with tons of sequels, and I believe the movie rights have already been optioned (sucks because they could never do justice..)
B00005JLH3|4.0|This 2002 film is a &quot;feel good&quot; film about the coming of age of a young black drummer, played by Nick Cannon.  He's part of a band in a Harlem high school and is so good at what he does that he gets a full scholarship to a Atlanta A&amp;T, a black university in the South.  The school is fictional but the band politics are not and he is soon goes though his own coming-of-age experience as he learns about competition and teamwork and growing up. In this school the band is everything, and when he and an slightly older classmate, played by Leonard Roberts, lock horns, there is conflict.  Under the hands of the wise teacher, played by Orlando Jones, they eventually come to an understanding in spite of the bumps of learning a lesson in the sport of life.  There's a pretty girl involved too, played by Zoe Saldana.<br />Best of all are the band sequences, with full costumes and choreography. The acting was uniformly good, and the script moved at a brisk pace. I did enjoy it even though the plot was a little simple for my personal taste and targeted towards a teen-age audience.
B000001FZK|5.0|I bought a copy of this CD when it came out in 1991.  I wish I had the money to buy a copy for everyone, because it seems as thought that would be the only way it could be heard by the numbers of listeners it deserves.  I keep hoping some of the tunes would be added to a film's soundtrack or some similar vehicle to spawn interest.  I have read much talk about the music and the vocals, but if you can decipher the hand written lyrics, that is even more of a bonus. I've listened to this CD countless times over the past 12 years (with added listening time for 'After The Flood'), and it always leaves me thirsty for more.  Check out the cover illustration by James Marsh.  Pure perfection.
0385508417|4.0|As someone who hates the commercial aspect of Christmas, I was delighted to read Skipping Christmas, and was actually rooting for the Kranks to get out of town as fast as possible. Just a concern though, and I hope someone can answer this. Why are the Kranks so relieved to find out that their daughter's Peruvian fiance's skin colour is &quot;not dark at all, but actually, two shades lighter than Luther Krank's&quot;?
B00009TB5G|5.0|The movie, which we have all probably seen by now, is of course fabulous. Again a suplement to, instead of a remake of the book. Visually stunning and constantly engaging.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Just brilliant. One of cinema's most beautiful tributes to itself, full of bittersweet tenderness and irony. Swanson is fabulous, and watching Von Stroheim portraying his own decadence with such sober dignity makes my heart bleed. The most beautiful ghost movie ever made. Watching it is like dreaming of loved ones long gone : in those dreams that everybody experiences every once in a while, the ones you love come back from the dead just for a short while, and you want to talk to them, hear them say that they return to stay, but they are vague, distant, blurry, they say that they can't stay, that it's not allowed, and they speak to others that you can't see, they know something that they can't tell, and just when you thought they were back for good, they disappear again, ignoring your cries. That's what this movie does. It's the final curtain call of legends of the past, to whom this movie gave the opportunity to take one last bow, as if saying : &quot;it was good, but we are no more - take a good look at us, it's the last one you'll ever have&quot;.
B00008977N|5.0|I have read most of all reviews preview purchasing it from Amazon.com and as I can see the common are critics on quality video and/or sound. I think we can divide this review in two aspects:<br />First, the PG show, what is, in escence, quite excellent. When Peter came to present Secret World Tour in Argentina (1994) he didn't brought at that time all the scenography that he present in Italy. So, for all who didn't see the italian (or european) show this is a very good piece to have.<br />Second, the media quality, meaning by this sound & video, depends on the DVD player you use. Video is enhanced for wide-screen so it seems a good idea playing the film in a big, wide and huge screen (or the bigger one you can access). Regarding the sound, it also depends on the sound capabilities of the system you use to play it. For instance, playing it on a computer looks quiet different than playing on supersonic multi-speaker home theater.<br />Because of this, now I can understand why we have different comments regarding the quality of the picture and the sound.<br />This is what I learn reading most of all reviews. Hope this can help others to make their own opinion.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Bravo for this 2002 film that brought the life and times of the artist Frida Kahlo to life!<br />Starring Salma Hayak in the title role, the audience is treated to a visual feast of her colorful and pain-filled life.  I've always admired Ms. Kahlo's paintings and yet never knew anything about her.  Now, its all here, and Julie Taymor, the director, uses the backdrop of Mexico and the colors of the sun to tell this inspiring story.<br />Born in 1907, Frida was only fifteen years old in 1922 when she was seriously injured in an accident.  Her back was shattered and a steel rod had pierced her body. For the rest of her life she was never free of pain.  And yet she managed to direct her agony into magnificent works of art.<br />The acting is outstanding, and Salma Hayak really was able to translate the complexities of role onto the screen.  Alfred Molina was cast as Diego Rivera, a fellow artist who loved her completely but could never stay faithful.  Together, the couple light up the screen with their passion and jealousy, which lasted a lifetime.  Frida had love affairs of her own, with women as well as men, and the romantic scenes keep the screen sizzling.  It's also clear how directly her pain is translated into her art.<br />Mexico itself was also a star of the film.  It seethes with beauty and political intrigue.  And the sunshine colors are a perfect backdrop for the tempestuous romantic story.  There are also some scenes in Paris and in New York and the director managed to convey a time and a place that once really existed and now is remembered with nostalgia.  The political climate also comes to life, as Frida ad Diego were Marxists and had optimistic visions of changing the world for the better. In retrospect it all seems naïve, but the times were alive with the turmoil of preconceived concepts being challenged.<br />I loved the film, loved the characters and was caught up in the story.  Highly recommended.
6305169187|3.0|Now 5 years old, and released around the time when Earth destruction seemed to be the winning formula at the box office. This Sfx out the wazoo epic has none of the flare, drama, or intellect that other offerings had around at that time (closest comparison being Deep Impact), and my only real complaint would be, that it thinks it did.<br />Here's the story - A huge Meteor is heading for Earth, and we're all about to die. Good news is that, after scouring the 5 Billion inhabitants on this planet, we managed to find a bunch of Oil Rig workers, who are the ONLY ones, able to save us.<br />Bruce Willis is at his best (and worst) as Iron Jawed team leader, who must land on the meteor, dig a hole, and plant some explosives. His fellow workers (all with colorful backgrounds) will be able to go from beer drinking party animal roughnecks, to fully trained and specialised astronauts in about 6 weeks, and then try and pull off this amazing feat before we all get roasted. Sounds great, and actually it is a lot of fun - just make sure you leave the grey matter behind on this one and accept it for what it is...

B00000DI06|2.0|Though the instrumental performance is adequate, I was quite disappointed with the choral performance in the requiem.  The group's diction is not together, several of the soloists are weak, and the overall balance of choir and orchestra is not even.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This 1999 Chinese movie is directed by Zhang Yimou, who also brought us &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;.  It stars Zhang Ziyi, the beautiful young actress who, the following year , received international fame in the well received &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.  &quot;The Road Home&quot; is a beautiful film, a romantic fantasy with a universal theme.<br />The first fifteen minutes and the last fifteen minutes are shot in black and white, bookending the story within the story.  It is set in a remote village in China, where the land is beautiful and it always seems to be winter.  The schoolteacher has died in a distant city.  And his widow wants to follow tradition and have his body carried home for burial.  At first her son, an engineer in the city who has rushed home, is reluctant to make arrangement for this, but later agrees and her wishes are carried out.<br />This is not the main story though.  Between these two black and white segments, there is another story, filmed in vivid color.  It is the story of the mother and father's romance.  It is sweet and touching and beautiful.  The schoolteacher is only 20 years old.  The girl is only 18.  We watch them fall in love, suffer a separation, and then come back to each other.  And this is all told without any physical contact between the two.  It's a &quot;feel good&quot; story all the way.<br />I enjoyed the film and the simple story.  And I also enjoyed the view of life in China and the fine cinematography.  Recommended.
B000002UB6|2.0|As the Beatles were releasing this album, and fading away into the self indulgent fare of their solo albums (Platic Ono Band? ugh), the Rolling Stones had yet to release their best work: Exile on Main Street.  The Stones had much more staying power.<br />As for Let It Be, it's not the Beatles worst work (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper were much worse) but it's also not as good as Abbey Road or A Hard Day's Night. <br />Those who claim this album is &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot; are off base.  It's far from raw with the overlay of Phil Spector.  And given the fact the four Beatles were rarely in the studio together as this was being done, don't criticize Phil.  Without him these would still be unspliced demo tapes.  Let It Be, Get Back, and Long and Winding Road are good.  Which brings up my final point.  No wonder John disliked this album.  He didn't contribute anything decent to it.<br />If you're building your collection, focus on Abbey Road as the final album.<br />2 stars.
6303421563|5.0|When I first saw The Professional, it was on TV, and even though I only saw a commercial for it, I was instantly drawn to it.  After Mathilda's whole family is killed, there is no one in the world for her except Leon, a hit man. Together they work to avenge her brother's death, and through it all they form a bond that is both questionable and endearing. Though there are people who find the relationship &quot;sick&quot;, I just don't see it. Mathilda needs someone to care for her and that person is Leon. Though she does act like a  modern day Lolita in some cases, Leon is firm in his decision not to let anything happen. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman do an amazing job in this film. I cannot believe that this is Natalie Portman's first film. She has such talent, and she portrays Mathilda's attitude well. I give this film five stars for great talent, great direction, and a great storyline.
0440133688|5.0|I first read this book at the beginning of my internship (2001) and, though I liked it very much, I found that the author's vision of Medicine was way too dark and bitter. It was more of a novel (like Robin Cook's, but actually good) than anything else for me.<br />(Some spoilers below)<br />Then, I read it again after becoming a doctor. And I don't see this book as a novel anymore. I could relate to almost all of Dr.Basch's (main char) crisis, his initial egomania that made him believe he could 'save the world', his withdrawn from friends and loved ones getting to such point that he'd prefer to hang at the ICU than to be with his girlfriend, seeing his intern friends deteriorate physically and psychologically while unaware of his own decay.<br />I was shocked when I realized I went through a lot of the things he had, including dear people acusing me of being cold and absent.<br />Some doctors say that internship destroys your inner being, others say that it makes it die and reborn like a Phoenix. Anyway, nobody goes through internship all the way without leaving something behind, and sometimes these things might be what you liked most about yourself. Or the ones that liked you.<br />Anyway it is an excellent, fun (very sarcastic) and, now I see, VERY realistic.<br />I love this book and I will likely read it again in a couple of years.
B000088E6D|5.0|Best voice, best sound ever. Larry King is right, this voice IS a must to hear. PURE, PURE MAGIC
B0000062S0|2.0|This gets one star just becuase it's page/plant -half of zeppelin and this gets one star for \\"Most High\\" and the title track and \\"Please read the Letter\\" and \\"Upon a Golden Horse.\\" I think they're the only truly interesting things going for this album. The song \\"Blue Train\\" is a near miss... something calm and kinda-like a Roy Orbison record, but still a little awkward and oddly unaffecting, when it should be emotionally potent stuff that lends itself well to an aging rocker. \\"Burning up\\" trys to rock hard, but smacks a little of desperation due to: it sounds like a demo with Page trying to do a mock metal rythmn that ends in half-melodic caterwauling from Plant. Literally everything else on the record is not memorable. Not the best Post-Zepp release from these guys and probably worse than Coverdale/PAGE! Although it's very near Page's band \\"The Firm\\" in the sense that they only have albums where half the songs have ANY merit to them- THE rest are borderline stinkers. Page and Plant have produced so much music filler on thier albums since Zep broke up, that one has to wonder if John Bonham and John Paul Jones weren't the heart and foundation of Led Zeppelin's sound. I did mention that there were some worthwhile songs on \\"Walking into Clarksdale.\\"
B000002UDB|1.0|The title track and Penny Lane are OK.  Everything else is mediocre - The Fool on Hill, Blue Jay Way, Flying, etc. don't exactly make a 5 star album. And the reviewer who compared this to Pink Floyd is off base.  Very little done by the Beatles is of the quality of Pink Floyd's work.<br />People who rate this 5 stars are just biased Beatle fans.

0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown's new entry to the Templar/Holy Grail genre deserves a 4.5 for the storyline, but a 1.5 for its historical and scientific claims.<br />Beginning with the murder of a curator of the Louvre, who leaves a cryptic message designed to ensure the invlvement of his daughter Sophie Neuveau, a cryptologist for the French Judicial Police, and of Robert Langdon, a Harvard art professor specializing in religious symbology, the story draws the reader into the amusing and exciting quest to decipher the sequence of puzzles that lead to the secret of the Holy Grail.  Unfortunately what starts out as an engaging story draws to a shaky, uncertain finish, losing momentum and closure.<br />What's much more bothersome to me is the lack of any visible relation of the background math, science, and history to factuality.<br />He claims (for example) that the golden ratio (approximately 1.61803, and the ratio of the long to short sides of most flags) represents the ratio of female to male bees in a hive. Balderdash.  Or that the ancient prejudice against left-handedness results from a program of defamation by the early church against the feminine, left-side, rather than the obvious explanation that a person who cah shake your hand and stab you at the same time seems sinister.  More egregiously, the author claims that Constantine (emperor 324-337) changed the day of Christian worship from Saturday to Sunday, ignoring the fact that  Justin the Martyr describes Christian worship on Sunday, no later than AD 155.<br />Most astonishingly, he suggests that the divinity of Jesus was not established until the Council of Nicea, ca 325, apparently ignorant of the fact that the issue addressed was the Arian heresy, not even an issue until the late third century, and which proposed that Jesus, while supernatural, was not consubstantial with God, and that Jesus, while first-created, was not co-eternal with God.  There had been lots of discussion about the nature of Jesus, but by far the maority belief was in the divinity of Jesus, not the skeptical denial of much modern theology, which Brown pretends was the prevailing view of the early Church.<br />The silliest thing Mr. Brown claims is that the Hebrew (unpronouncable) name of God - YHWH - was derived from the 16th century translation mistake Jehovah.  A good discussion of the origin of the word \\"Jehovah\\" is given in Gunther Plaut's commentary \\"The Torah\\" pp 425-6.<br />In summary, an enjoyable story that despite faltering at the end, is mostly a pleasant read.

B000002J1U|5.0|I don't care if some of these songs on LZ3 are derivative of early material from other artists nor that Zeppelin is an old band. This album is laidback with plenty of nuance and charm, it's not overplayed on radio with the exception of maybe &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot; I don't listen to ClassicRock radio so I don't get overexposed to this material and I like this album whenever I hear it- 10 years after I bought it. Plenty of Light and Shade as Mr. Page would say. Also, hunt down a copy of the &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; single which has the very excellant b-side &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; which was recorded during the sessions for this album. Altogether credit must be given to Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham for a moment of creative daring, when they abandoned the hard rock style that gave them fame.
B000002WPI|5.0|the wus first and by far their best album, 36 chambers revolutionised the sound of underground hip-hop and spawned a million solo albums and projects.released in 93, the RZA's awesome production sounds as fresh today as it ever did. And when a producer like the RZA in his prime has the lyrical skillz of raekwon, inspectah deck, ghostface, method man and GZA to rip em up, you get a heavy album. All the tracks are dope, my favorites are; can it all be so simple - grimey beat with ghost and rae lacin it with ill-type rhymes, CREAM - a classic track with sick verses from rae and INS and a superb beat & Proteck ya neck - underground hip-hop banger, every wu-gambino drops a hot verse, topped by GZA unforgettable verse 'first of, whos your a&r, a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar, cos he dont know the meaning of dope, when hes looking for a suit & tie rap thats cleaner than bar of soap', it doest get much better than this and unfortunately it doesnt for wu, whos follow up albums look wack compared to this (read nas and illmatic)

0316666343|2.0|After reading about the plot of this book I was very excited to begin reading it.  The story started off well, however, it went downhill quickly.  After Susie dies she watches her parents, siblings, murderer, and a couple of classmates from heaven.  She also describes her heaven which she shares with another child.  While the idea of this book is wonderful, I felt there were too many characters and I was never able to learn enough about one to connect with him or her.  I was very disappointed after reading this story.
B00005B36H|1.0|Though this is Tool's most commercially successful album it is easily their most repetative, over-produced, and weakest album to date.  The effort can be heard-that is clear-but the delivery is way off mark.  Aenema was an unequivocalbe album.  It raised expectations to perhaps an unreasonable level because Lateralus falls below even their debut ep.  I have no doubt that Tool while rise from the ashes of this wreck; but, we are still waiting for that Phoenix

B0000029DD|5.0|I got into Jeff Buckley quite a while after this album came out, and after I found out that he already passed away. I think if I had found out he died after I listened to the album, I would have found it much more tragic, so in a way, it was nice to know ahead of time that he only had one real album. Of course the reason for this is that Grace is an amazing, one-of-a-kind album. It's just full of great songs, with melodies that are so perfect you'll swear you've heard them before. My favorites are Last Goodbye (the closest to happy you'll hear Buckley) and Lover, You Should've Come Over. However, there is so much variety on Grace that it's much better to listen to as an album than it is to listen to the songs individually. The only complaint I have about this album is that makes me so emotional, I often feel depressed while I listen to it. I guess that aspect of the album really culminates on So Real. In one way, I feel it's the weakest song on the album, but on the other hand I can't help but feel Buckley's anguish when I listen to that song, so I do appreciate it very much. Really, none of the songs here are easy listens. Oh, and one last thing: Jeff Buckley is easily the best male vocalist I have ever heard, and that more than anything makes his only album seem sad to me.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD is the best of the SOAD Cd's, with a little more funk and upbeat tempos than Toxicity or the self-titled.

Chic 'N' Stu: A fantastic opener, with really funny and interesting lyrics. A hilarious headbanger. 9/10<BR>2. Innervision: The big radio single, catchy and easy to listen to. 8/10<BR>3. Bubbles: Didn't like it at first, but then it really started to grow on me. 8/10<BR>4. Boom!: Easily the most political song on the album, and I love it! Very catchy with cool time changes. 9/10<BR>5. Nuguns: Will grow on you like Bubbles, and you can hear the middle eastern musical influences more on this track. 9/10<BR>6. A.D.D.: One of the best songs on the album, very angry, and a tight musical background. 10/10<BR>7. Mr. Jack: Tied with Streamline for the best song on the album. Incredible. You have to hear it to believe it. 10/10<BR>8. IEAIAIO: Cool enough. Should be on the radio a lot more than it is. 8/10<BR>9. 36: Pointless, really. 2/10<BR>10.

F**k the System: Like the Highway song, good, but not great. 7/10<BR>13.Ego Brain: Very smooth, yet hard, and I love it. 9/10<BR>14.Thetawaves: Essentially an intro to Roulette. 7/10<BR>15. Roulette: Amazing song, easily one of the best and most listenable on the album. Wow. 10/10<BR>16.Streamline: I can never decide between this and Mr. Jack as my favorite song, but this song is amazing in that it is mellow and hard, and there is a huge egyptian-middle eastern musical flavor to this song. Unbelievably good. 10/10
B00005OAIE|4.0|I loved this CD and honestly I think the people that didn't like it, don't appreciate this type of music. <br />I really liked it, but hey people have different opinions.<br />I would say anyone who likes acoustic guitar, and nice melodies will enjoy this. Comparing this to Dave Matthews though, in my opinion, is a mistake. Mayer's band has no horns, no fiddler, and most of Mayer's songs are upbeat.<br />Anyway I hope someone finds this helpful.<br />--A fan

076781326X|4.0|My mother used to play the soundtrack when I was younger.  Imagine my delight when my daughter sang a medley of 'Oliver' for her school performance.  I bought the DVD for her to see 'where the songs came from.'  She loves it as much as I do.
0446608955|4.0|I recently read \\"A Walk to Remember\\" by Nicholas Sparks.  After seeing the movie, I knew I had to read it.  I must admit I am fonder of the book, now that I've read it, than I am of the movie.  I love how Sparks writes the book from Landon Carter's point of view instead of Jamie's as in the movie.  This lets you get to know how he's feeling about his family, girls, and life in general.  Landon meets Jamie, the daughter of a preacher, in drama class at their high school.  Jamie helps out Landon with his lines for the play against her wishes, but she always seems to see the good in everyone, no matter how bad their past has been, or what they have done.  They spend a great deal of time together with rehearsing.  Sparks does an excellent job of getting across to the reader that as much as Landon doesn't want to, he is falling for the preacher's daughter.  As the story progresses, he realizes what he has been missing.  He has made fun of this beautiful, pure girl ever since he could remember and it has taken him twelve years of school to realize.  This book is written with a great deal emotion.  Sparks warns the reader at the very beginning of the book, \\"First you will smile, and then you will cry-don't say you haven't been warned...\\" I cried over and over again for this book.  Nicholas Sparks did a splendid job of portraying the characters of who they really were.
0312263120|1.0|Prior to picking up Digital Fortress I had read all of Dan Brown's other works, and had been hugely impressed with his complex plotting, research, and attention to detail.  None of those traits were apparent in this book, which made for a wide gap between my expectations going in and the experience I ended up having.  If you read a lot of mysteries/thrillers, you're going to have the next plot twist figured out pages ahead of it actually being revealed.  Character development is clumsy and tedious.  We learn about bit players like the DCI's assistant and a secretary in excrutiating detail, when they aren't key to the main story. I also found myself saying &quot;Yeah, right&quot; more than once due the the unbelievability of certain characters.  For instance, Jabba (the head of IT) continuously berates and insults his boss, the DCI (this is the most powerful spymaster in the known world) in front of other low-level government employees.  Like that's gonna ever happen in real life!  In any good novel (or movie for that matter) there's a certain concept called suspension of disbelief, which is critical to the success of larger-than-life tales, of which this is one.  It never kicked in on this book, and I found myself constantly thinking about the writing instead of enjoying the story.  Even if you're a diehard Dan Brown fan like me, take a pass on this book - you'll be glad you did.
B000099T2L|1.0|With all of the guest appearances on this cd you would think that Beyonce's first solo attempt would be wonderful. Unfortunately it isn't the songs have no direction and only one song actually grabs your attention.(Crazy In Love) Beyonce's duet with Luther Vandross is laughable at best and is another attempt to label Beyonce as a credible artist when she is far from it. Save your money buy Monica's cd instead or better yet wait for Alicia Keys' new cd.
B000099T2L|5.0|Now, I'm gon' be good and ignore the haters cause I don't feel like writing alot.  Now when I bought my 3 copies of \\"Dangerously In Love\\"...I expected up-tempos like \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" and a few ballads like \\"Speechless\\" & \\"Dangerously In Love\\" all of which I had heard before the album was released. When I popped the CD in, I was surprised at the slow songs.  I guess with the crazy-fast first single I expected some heavy hitting album.  But it wasn't but I loved it more.  I personally like the slow songs better.  Here's a review of each individual song:<br />1. Crazy In Love (w/ Jay-Z)- I'm sure yall hurd this song...witht he hard beats that'll hurt ur ears if u blast it too loud. Written and produced by Beyoncé...5/5 STARS<br />2. Naughty Girl - This is one of the albums shining tracks.  Beyoncé shows off her fantastic vocal range in this song.  It showcases her voice well. Written and produced by Beyoncé...5/5 STARS<br />3. Baby Boy (w/ Sean Paul) - This is a hott song and will apparently be the next single since it's already on the radio.  Sean Paul does his thing as well on the track.  There's two versions of this song...where the verses are different...only this version made it on the album. Written and produced by Beyoncé...5/5 STARS<br />4. Hip-Hop Star (w/ Big Boi & Sleepy Brown) - This is another hot up-tempo track with Big Boi from Outcast and Sleepy Brown.  The song has a funky beat and Beyoncé sings differently, but shes still hott. Written and produced by Beyoncé...5/5 STARS<br />5. Be With You - The moment I hurd this song...I knew it was one of my favorites on the album.  This song is just unexplainably hott. Written and produced by Beyoncé...10/5 STARS<br />6. Me, Myself & I - This song is the first track where the album begins to slow down and become ballad-type tracks.  This song is hott but not one of my faves. Written and produced by Beyoncé...4/5 STARS<br />7. Yes - YES this song is hott!!!  She talks about arelationship where the first time she says no it's liek she never said yes.  She did a great job writing this song. Written and produced by Beyoncé...5/5 STARS<br />8. Signs (ft. Missy Elliot) - This song was written and produced by Missy Elliot and she makes an apperance in it too. It talks about the different Zodiac Signs that her sagittarius man is like, and guess who is a Sagittarius...Jay-Z...it's a hott song...5/5 STARS<br />9. Speechless - Beyoncé, \\"all I can say is...yes\\" cause \\"You got me...speechless\\" when I listen to this song.  She is fire on this song...oh my Lord...when she sings the \\"YESSSSSSSSSS\\" part oh my Lord, it's wonderful...it'll give you goosebumps. Written and produced by Beyoncé...7/5 STARS<br />10. That's How You Like It (w/ Jay-Z) - \\"That's how you like it, huh?\\" Yup that's how I like it.  This song was written by Jay-Z and produced by D-Roy & Mr. B(whoever they are)...and it's hott...Jay-Z makes another apperance on the album, on the song he wrote for Bee...5/5 STARS<br />11. The Closer I Get To You  (duet with Luther Vandross) - This duet with Luther is wonderful...together they covered the song and made it even better...I love the vocals and the song...it's hott...hope Luther get's better...5/5 STARS<br />12. Dangerously In Love 2 - Yes, this is the song from \\"Survivor\\" with a new beat...Beyoncé vocally, lyrically shines once again...Written and produced by Beyoncé...7/5 STARS<br />13. Beyoncé Interlude - This is a lil' poem thing that Bee recites...it's pretty...Written and produced by Beyoncé...5/5 STARS<BR> <BR>14. Gift From Virgo - This song is a gift from a Virgo named Beyoncé...this along with \\"Be With You\\" is my favorite song on the album!!!...Alot of people (for some reason) do not like this song...but I love it...Written and produced by Beyoncé...15/5 STARS<br />HIDDEN BONUS TRACK<br />15.

B00005ASOI|5.0|Dario Argento chose to temporarily leave his giallo roots behind for this halucinatory and supernatural thriller.<BR>This is easily one of the best Argento films, spawning a truely chilling and beautiful soundtrack, cowriten with the infamous band Goblin.<BR>This films relies heavily on atmosphere and Arento never fails to deliver beautifuly dark sets and halucinatory colors. This film is truely a work of art and would set a standard for future Italian film makers. <BR>With one of the most ruthless and chilling murder scenes that I have ever wittnesed, this film is truely in a class of its own.<BR>Some tips about this particular DVD- I would actually recommend getting the three disc set rather than this one and also the daemonia music video is extremely cheesy and is not worth your time of day, unless you want to see a bunch goofy looking metal heads attempting to look evil and vampirical while churning out Goblin's theme.
B00005MP58|2.0|Like at least one other reviewer I was disheartened to see how poorly this great mini-series was transferred onto DVD format.  I, too, have watched my VHS version many times.   I had excitedly expected the DVD to be better in both sound and video quality, but, alas, it is sadly worse.  I had to fiddle with the brightness and color controls on my TV to even get a passable color rendition.  How, how, did this travesty get released?  I feel so stung by this experience that I think a &quot;technical quality&quot; rating of sound and video should be part of any DVD review, particularly transcriptions from VHS.  It makes me leery about buying DVD versions of other old VHS favorites without renting them first or otherwise obtaining a preview of the DVD quality.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Before I begin, I have to say that my little review will contain \\"spoilers,\\" so if you are the type of person who can't stand having a movie, however dull and contrived, spoiled for you, I suggest you do not continue reading.<br />I know that David Lynch has a strong cult following.  I also know that many consider \\"Mulholland Drive\\" his magnum opus, alongside \\"Twin Peaks,\\" of course.  However, I can't say that I enjoy Lynch's work.  \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is boring and so pretentious that it makes \\"Donnie Darko\\" (which I thoroughly enjoyed) look like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\"  <br />The much-debated storyline is really not as confusing as most people seem to think.  The first two hours are basically comprised of a long and utterly tedious dream sequence that combines a hodgepodge of barely-connected plots and characters, none of whom interesting enough to retain the viewer's attention if it were not for the odd shocker: a scary fuzzball at the back of Winkie's restaurant, an erotic but rather random lesbian sex scene, a humorous Tarantino-esque accident-prone hitman.  Finally, the dream ends.  But does Lynch mercifully end it there and call it quits?  No, there's still another half hour in which he attempts to rationalize the dream.<br />If taken chronologically, the basic plot is so simple it's really terribly cliché.  Diane Selwin, a young woman who, after winning a jitterbug contest in Ontario, came to Los Angeles to become an actress, finds herself doing.. well... not that great.  Making it big is difficult.  Her lover, Camilla Rhodes, is a beautiful up-and-coming movie star; she took the part in \\"The Sylvia North Story\\" that Diane wanted.  After going to a dinner party hosted by director Adam Kesher's mother, known to everyone as \\"Coco,\\" Camilla and Adam announce that they are engaged.  This revelation causes much dismay for Diane, and she later meets a hitman at Winkie's, giving him a rather hefty bag filled with money to kill the woman who was once her lover.He accepts the deal and tells her that when Camilla is dead, Diane will find a blue key.  What does this blue key open?  Lynch apparently had no ideas about this one, so he has his hitman answer with a knowing laugh.  Knowing laughs always bail you out.<br />So later, Diane has a dream, which makes up the grunt of the movie, in which she is an aspiring actress named Betty (a nom de reve taken from a reality-based waitress's nameplate) who comes to Los Angeles to make it big.  So far so good.  She stays at a glorious mansion owned by her aunt, who was once a famous movie star herself, in which she meets Rita, a woman who looks suspiciously like Camilla in reality.  Rita was the object of a hit, but after a car accident foiled this attempted assasination, Rita escaped with everything intact- except her memory.  Betty and Rita then spend the remainder of the dream playing detective, trying to discover Rita's true identity.  Along the way, they encounter a decomposing corpse, a weird monotoned cowboy, a creepy club called \\"Silencio,\\" and lots of sex.<br />And finally, Diane wakes up only to go insane.  After a short and uninspired battle with an old couple (quite possibly the scariest cinematic old couple ever), Diane shoots herself.  The End.<br />There's much more, of course, but 1,000 words is not enough to fully describe the pretentious, ridiculous, and hopelessly convoluted plot that is \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"  If you are the type of person who enjoys movies that try to be as confusing as possible, then by all means! Watch this film!  Love it, even!  I, on the other hand, cannot possibly consider this movie to be anything but an irksome piece of pap that plods along portentously.  The movie's plot is not that difficult to decipher, but most of us finish watching it... and just don't really care anymore what it's about.  Just as long as it's over.

B000069HK2|5.0|What an extremely amazing collection of songs made by The Used. Not only does each song come off as completely original and fresh but also has an unbelievably addicting quality to it. Even though I have found that a lot of hardcore bands are adamant about expressing any emotional feeling that would make them sound like emo, The Used has been able to express full heartedly a spectrum of emotions without comprimising the hardcore soul behind it. From song #1 Maybe Memories to the hidden song (Choke Me) that is attached to the last song #12 Pieces Mended, I have found that there is so much talent in each member of the band placed into every mind throbbing beat it is hard not to listen and enjoy. Speaking of the hidden song, if you buy the cd or have a chance to listen to a friends do not miss this because it shows the unbelievable hardcore base which this cd was formed on, a pleasant surprise for me. The lead singer, Bert, has one of the most diversified and rare voices in the music industry, that you find only every once in awhile, that you can enjoy every form he sings or screams in. I have often times found myself passing over my once favorite cds to pop in The Used for something to listen to instead, they have now become one of my most treasured cds. I would definately recommend this to anyone that has enough interest to even read the reviews posted.

B00005LB50|5.0|The music on this disc rates five stars. The sound on Disc Four is breathtaking, and the demos are pure gold, especially for those interested in the evolution of a songwriter (Neil Young's \\"Down Down Down\\" demo, for example, contains elements of two future masterpieces, \\"Broken Arrow\\" and \\"Country Girl\\"). My complaint is the usual one voiced by those who review this monumental set--WHERE THE BLOODY HELL ARE THE LIVE TRACKS??? They have to be out there somewhere--it's hard to believe that there are no live recordings in existence of a band whose live performances are legendary for their passion and ferocity. Maybe, as I've heard (hopefully) expressed  elsewhere, they are being held back for another compilation. I understand the bootlegs STAMPEDE and SELL OUT offer amazing live performances with poor sound. Can't all the recording industry's modern technology clean up those tapes enough to satisfy the artists and let all of us hear just how amazing the Springfield was on stage? C'mon, guys, give us a break.
0385503954|4.0|At the conclusion of the narrative proper, the initials B.T. identify the novel's protagonist, Briony Tallis, as its author.  Some 59 years after the events she has described, she declares that the version before us is the eighth and final one, differing from all of its predecessors which were \\"pitiless.\\"  Yet this one too must remain unpublished (sic!) because of potential legal actions which might be brought against the author by some of the persons she has portrayed.  Thus ends a novel which is as much about the creative process in general and the motivation for the shape of this particular work as it is about the actual particulars recalled.<BR>Thirteen years old at the beginning of her account in l935, Briony already aspires to being a writer.  To date, her writing have been childish fairy tales.  Her witness to the developing relationship between her older sister, Cecelia, and Robbie Turner, the son of the family's housekeeper, brings her to the realization that human events offer a better foundation for writing than does fantasy.  She might impartially describe her experiences and so be \\"delivered from the cumbersome struggle between good and bad, heroes and villains.\\" (p. 38)<BR>Briony's first attempt at such writing \\"Two Figures by a Fountain,\\" completed in l940, describes an awkward encounter between Cecelia and Robbie as recorded from their viewpoints as well as the author's.  Although it is rejected by the publisher to whom she has submitted it, the editor's comments are instructive with respect to the further evolution of her memoir.  While praising Briony for her ability to capture the mood of the moment from diverse perspectives, he asserts that \\"such writing can become precious when there is no sense of forward movement.  Development is required.\\" (p. 295) Briony herself has recognized the necessity for such a progression: \\"She had to discover the stories, not just the subjects, but a way of unfolding them.\\" (p. 150)<BR>Events appear to provide the impetus for that development and, in the versions of her manuscript dating after 1940, she created a more complex narrative.  Central to it is her adolescent failure to comprehend the intensity of Cecelia and Robbie's passion.  She is distraught by the obscene content of a note he has requested her to carry to Cecelia and when she happens upon the two of them engaged in sex, Briony is confirmed in her conviction that Robbie is a \\"maniac.\\"  It is her naive misapprehension which will lead to Robbie's subsequent arrest when she wrongly identifies him as the man who has assaulted one of her female cousins.<BR>Presumably, in the years intervening between the rejection of the nouvella and the completion of the final draft, she has had ample opportunity to reflect upon the injustice of her action (which resulted in Robbie's imprisonment prior to his being released for military service).  Left unspecified is the nature of the \\"pitiless\\" content of these prior drafts and the degree of remorse she may have expressed in them.  From the epilogue's ambiguous conclusion, we realize that Briony has manipulated her manuscript to achieve certain effects and indeed, we are left to wonder if the entire narrative has been influenced by that early editor's advice to create a sense of forward movement.
6302732778|5.0|This was the very impressive follow-up to his \\"Alien\\" after a four year hiatus. The story centers around an ex-cop, Harrison Ford, in the year 2019, called back in by his ex-boss to help locate and terminate a gaggle of renegade humanoid clones, called \\"replicants\\" before they do any more damage. This movie was supposed to be THE sci-fi film of 1983, and almost was, but some people didn't think so, initially.<br />You may note a pattern here of me having a lot of favorites among the films that, for some ODD reason, critics haven't been kind to, despite the fact that they were obviously exceptional. Such was the case here, too, as this movie, for a good decade after it was released, garnered only two star reviews on a scale of four or five in most of the reviews I've read, along with \\"Legend\\", another Scott masterpiece.<br />What size pine cones are stuck up the kiesters of these professional couch potatoes, anyway? For art direction alone, Blade Runner should have praised heaped on it! The visuals in this movie even surpass \\"Star Wars\\" and nip at the heels of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" for sheer jaw-dropping impressiveness. It had few equals among non-blockbusters of the period!<br />The acting, again, as it is in MOST good sci-fi, is actually, in ways, better than it would be in a normal drama. Professional psycho-actor, Rutger Hauer, as Roy Batty, gives the performance of his life here, (before going on to \\"The Hitcher\\" where he REALLY gets scary!) as do Sean Young as a replicant that doesn't realize she IS one initially, Joanna Cassidy, as a replicant that was used in a murder squad and Daryl Hannah, as Rutger Hauer's last partner in crime. William Sanderson, (he of \\"Newhart\\" fame,) is suitably creepy and meek as a HUMAN Tyrell Corporation grunt named J. M. Sebastian, who actually helps engineer these things.<br />Poor Joanna Cassidy, (this woman has GOT to get a better agent!) as Zora, is here as one of the first replicants to die...this started an unfortunate sequence of roles for this poor woman where it seemed like the ONLY purpose in her films was to be murdered: Next, as far as I know, came \\"The Fourth Protocol\\", where Pierce Brosnan sliced her to ribbons and \\"The Perfect Family\\", where Bruce BOXLEITNER {{strangled}} her! (That's right...good old, clean-living Captain Sherdan, Scarecrow and Tron himself!) The only major role I can think of her NOT getting killed in was Delores in \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\". She better not make a Woody Allen movie!!<br />A few semi-well known character actors are in here too, like M. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, the aforementioned Sanderson, and they round out the major cast of what had to be one of the better non-Lucas sci-fi movies of the early eighties and a classic for all time. It's obvious that, so far, one can't make a bad movie from a Philip K. Dick story, since \\"Total Recall\\" was also excellent, however, BOTH films are incredibly violent! \\"Recall\\" much more than \\"Runner\\". So much so, that it almost takes on a theater of the absurd quality for its excess of it.<br />I wonder...I WONDER...which one of Dick's stories will be next!<br />\\"Apocalypse Tomorrow\\"? \\"Kaboom! Said the Tick Tock Man\\"?<br />.....\\"The Legion of Decency, Mine Enemies!\\"???

B000063V8T|4.0|The fifth season of Star Trek TNG begins with the Klingon Empire in the midst of a civil war, and ends with Mark Twain.  In between these two episodes lies a season of mostly great drama.  I have previously written that seasons three and four were, in my opinion, TNG at its best.  The fifth season continued to give us great entertainment, but we encounter a few more clunkers than we did in the previous two seasons.  Others have mentioned that \\"Cost of Living,\\" and \\"Imaginary Friend,\\" were less than impressive and I have to agree.  I also felt that \\"New Ground,\\" and \\"Hero Worship,\\" left much to be desired.  Still, the few poor episodes are far outnumbered by great ones.  For me, the brightest of the gems was the two-part story, \\"Unification,\\" in which Spock makes his reappearance.  It was a real treat for those of us who are fans of the original series to see our favorite Vulcan again.  This story is what drew me to TNG and I stayed with it.  More than that, Spock's character was interwoven with the continuing plot thread involving the Romulans.  Since the beginning of the third season, the writers did a commendable job in maintaining ongoing plot threads with other major races, including the Romulans, Klingons and later, the Cardassians.  \\"Unification,\\" is an excellent example of this.  In the second part of \\"Unification,\\" we meet Tassha Yarr's evil Romulan daughter Sela, whom we first encounter in the season premier/second part of \\"Redemption.\\"  Also in the fifth season, we get to meet the fiery Ensign Ro, played to perfection by Michelle Forbes.  Forbes is one of the few actors who found life after Star Trek, including major roles in the hit television series, \\"Homicide, Life on the Street,\\" and \\"24.\\"  Wesley Crusher returns in two episodes, \\"The Game,\\" and \\"The First Duty.\\"  Some of us aren't big Wes fans and it was nice to see him knocked from his idealistic pedestal in the latter.  We get to see Picard as a family man in, \\"The Inner Light,\\" and that episode produced one of the most beautiful musical scores I've come across in Star Trek.  \\"I Borg,\\" is powerful drama at its best as we watch Picard wrestle with the trauma of his ordeal with the Borg.  The scene when he first confronts Hughe is priceless.  It is similar to what might happen when a rape victim confronts her attacker and it showed a vulnerable side to Picard that we seldom see.  \\"Darmok,\\" is also a great episode in that it demonstrates how lack of adequate communication can make or break relations between two cultures.  Other noteworthy episodes include \\"Cause and Effect,\\" \\"Power Play,\\" \\"Disaster,\\" \\"A Matter of Time,\\" and \\"The Next Phase.\\"  Unfortunately, the season climaxes with my least favorite of the two-part shows, \\"Time's Arrow.\\"  The time-travel scenarios have been done to death on Star Trek and the use of Mark Twain was ridiculous.  Still, despite the few bad eggs, the fifth season of TNG is worth owning, whether you're just getting started or a long-time Trek fan.
B00007BHOE|4.0|Slipknot's first DVD release was well-anticipated by the web-watchers of roadrunnerrecords.com, as it was by many hardcore nu-metal heads around the world. As the morose, suicidal and angst-ridden teens waited with bated breath, Corey and the 'Knot crew took a sigh of relief and took time to reflect upon their latest monstrosity, 'Disasterpieces'- The 'Knot live in London. While most of us have never had the pleasure of seeing the band up close and personal, the 'maggots' in this audience are lucky enough to be belittled by Taylor, beaten to  pulps by Sid and given an all-round good dose of pure and unadulterated SLIPKNOT. Luckily, the DVD enables you to view the concert from various positions on the stage - each of Slipknot's nine members were assigned a camera, which was taped to the sides of their heads, all-in-all, giving you different angles to observe this brutality in. Bonus features include a mindblowing solo-performance by Joey Jordison (check this out, it is INSANE for lack of any other distinctive word); A formerly-rare animated version of the 'Wait &amp; Bleed' video; an audio clip of 'Purity (cut from their self-titled album)' and various other videos (including 'My Plague').<BR>The most impressive of all in the Slipknot camp are Corey, who maintains some strains of melodical verse through the concert torrent of screaming, cursing and roaring; Jordison, who's stamina is amazing and dumbfounding, but most heart-warming is when the crowd joins Taylor to belt out 'Wait &amp; Bleed'.<BR>Featuring songs from boths Slipknots' 2nd and 3rd albums, 'Disasterpieces' is the ultimate viewing for those who have never seen their own 9-piece pound-of-flesh.<BR>Highly Commendable.
B000063V8U|4.0|One of the neatest things about these DVD sets are the documentaries.  I haven't mentioned them in my reviews up to this point and that is a failure on my part.  I mention them now because I was somewhat disappointed in the sixth season extras as opposed to the extras on the previous five box sets.  I'm only grumbling because the bonus material included a trailer for DS9, which is not my favorite Trek series.  It also contained a trailer for Star Trek Nemesis.  Obviously it was meant to be viewed before the movie came out, but I've already seen the movie and was angry that Paramount wasted good DVD space on a trailer for such a mediocre movie.  Still, the profile on Data was great and as always, its nice to see the insights that the writers, directors and producers give us into the episodes.  In one of the documentaries, someone mentioned that the sixth season of TNG was their best season ever.  I disagree with this assertion.  I've always championed seasons three and four as being top quality.  Still, the sixth season delivered consistently superior drama and contained fewer clunkers than did the fifth season.  We started out with the worst of the two-parters, &quot;Time's Arrow,&quot; and continued with the mediocre, &quot;Realm of Fear,&quot; but after that, the season took off with the arrival of Scotty.  It was a delight to see Spock make his appearance and it was equally fun for me as an original series fan to see Scotty again in the episode, &quot;Relics.&quot;  It was also nostalgic to see the old Enterprise bridge.  Q makes two appearances in this season in, &quot;True Q,&quot; and &quot;Tapestry.&quot;  In the former, we get to see a slightly softer side of Q as he tries to mentor a young girl who discovers she has the power of the Q.  &quot;Tapestry,&quot; is one of my all-time favorite Trek episodes because we learn more of Picard's past and Q teaches him a harsh lesson about life.  This is De Lancie and Stewart at their best!  Worf also confronts his past in the two-part, &quot;Birthright,&quot; when he journeys to a Romulan prison camp to find his father.  Troi also sees more action when she goes undercover as a Romulan officer in, &quot;Face of the Enemy.&quot;  It is worth noting that Spock's Romulan underground movement is mentioned in this episode.  Unfortunately, this would be the last time we see a major plot thread involving the Romulans.  We also see the continuing plot thread involving the Klingon Empire come to an end in, &quot;Rightful Heir,&quot; as a new leader challenges Gowron as ruler of the Klingon world.  We would hear of the Klingons and Romulans again in later seasons of Deep Space Nine, but DS9 never did justice to them as TNG did.  Other gems include &quot;The Quality of Life,&quot; &quot;The Chase,&quot; &quot;Rascals,&quot; &quot;Aquiel,&quot; &quot;Frame of Mind,&quot; and &quot;A Fist Full of Datas.&quot;  The only clunkers worth noting are &quot;Second Chances,&quot; and &quot;Realm of Fear.&quot;  Many other reviewers have mentioned, &quot;Chain of Command,&quot; and I think this was probably the best offering of the sixth season.  Watching Riker clash with a new captain of the Enterprise was classic, but the most riveting drama came as Picard was tortured by a Cardassian officer, played by Trek veteran David Warner.  It was interesting to note that Patrick Stewart did research on torture before performing in this episode.  Finally, unlike the previous season, the finale of &quot;Descent,&quot; was another great cliffhanger.  Its always fun when Lore appears to provide the psychotic counterpart to Data's cool presence.  Throw Lore in league with a group of renegade Borg and you can't help but have suspense at its best.  All and all, the sixth season of TNG is a great addition to anyone's collection.  I would not recommend it to beginners, only because many plot threads are more easily understood after viewing previous seasons.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I cannot stand all these 'music fans' speaking in such high regard of these no-talent inbreeding rip-offs from Detroit.  Stop comparing them to Nirvana, because Nirvana happened once and will never happen again.  Instead of buying an album that sounds like a third rate compilation of Bob Dylan, Velvet Underground, Robert Johnson, and Zeppelin, why don't you actually buy those guys albums.  PEOPLE WAKE UP, STOP SUPP0RTING MUSIC THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. Meg is ugly. (and untalented too)
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King has been a favourite of all time and not just with me, but nearly everyone i know or knew. I first saw The Lion King with my mum when i was four and every since i've been hooked. I always cry at the part where Mufasa dies, even though i've seen it about a million times and am 14 years old. Now that video's are going downhill, I was wondering when The Lion King would come out on DVD and here it is and a Special Edition too. A classic story of a headstrong Lion cub who struggles to find his place in the circle of life. This DVD has stunning animation, quality surround sound and a brillient storyline, which, alltogether makes The Lion King the ultimate, \\"King\\" of DVD's
B00007JVBI|1.0|nothing special here.  another boring artist that has fans that like music because of the image (that image being the one that supposedly doesn't have an image).  People that will enjoy  this most likely enjoy getting the same bobby dyed-black haircut that all there friends have, even though its completely original, right? Also, the electronics used in the background of this album are completely unoriginal and mundane.  This album can be summed up in two words: BOR ING
B00005JKHN|2.0|Sleeping Beauty has been a classic story for centuries and now it's special edidtion release on DVD means more people can see this tale the way it was meant to be told and although it's a great story with brillient animation and an excellent plot it doesn't quite match up to some Disney classics like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Sorry folks but this tale ain't gettin' a high vote fae me.
B000089CJI|1.0|NO, NO THEY ARE NOT............they are not groundbreaking, original, or any of those other positive adjetives people have been throwing out about The Postal Service.  Hard to believe DNTEL could have his name put on this.  And for all the skeptics who were waiting for Death Cab to completely fizzle over and show how truly bad they were, well, here is your sneak preview.
B000000NN1|5.0|This is probably the best &quot;starter&quot; album for anbody wanting hear the massive range of styles and talents that is Valgelis Papathanasiou.  Less abstract than his albums &quot;Beauborg&quot; or &quot;Ignacio&quot;, and yet more powerful and moody than the lightweight offerings on &quot;The City&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.<br />This, along with &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot;, &quot;Spiral&quot;, &quot;China&quot; and &quot;Antarctica&quot; are probably the best work this genious has ever done.  He is definitely an aquired taste.  But one worth getting if you can.  Music to stir your very soul.
0385504209|2.0|This is the first fiction I have purchased in years and the shallow quality of this writing reinforced my purchase ethics. Characters were so thin and undeveloped as to be cartoonish, the 'clues' and 'connections' seemed to have been chosen by lottery and gooped together in silly ways, from whatever stack of notes was handy, or<br />dinner conversations remembered. This is the last time I fall for the media hype....I heard this book recommended on NPR I think, so I was truly shocked when it turned out to be sloppy rather than a well crafted conspiracy tale. It was however, a delightful revisit to the Louvre galleries and Westminster Abbey's hallowed halls, crypts and floor tombs.
020530902X|5.0|Quickly approaching its hundred-year anniversary, &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; - a pocket reference guide created by Cornell professor William Strunk as an aide for his students is today as relevant and helpful as ever.  The introduction by E.B. White is worth the price of the book by itself, but when his immense talents are combined with his professor's, the world ends up with a valuable tool.<br />&quot;The Elements of Style&quot; contains everything a practitioner of the English language would need.  The book starts with &quot;Elementary Rules of Usage&quot; which references the proper rules for possessives, parenthetic expressions, colons, dashes, etc.  The book then moves on to &quot;Elementary Principles of Composition&quot;, advising writers to use the active voice, choose a suitable design and hold to it, and among other things - omit needless words!  That last tidbit of advice can't not ever in a million years be written enough times for people to read it and understand, you know?<br />The remainder of &quot;Elements of Style&quot; focuses on form, commonly misused words and expressions, and the writer's individual approach to style.  This last part takes on the role of a coach for the writer - simply reminding him of the various do's and don't that make writing clear and concise.  Overall, this is a helpful book and a handy reference for one's desktop.  If you find yourself constantly wondering if &quot;who&quot; or &quot;whom&quot; should be used, then this is the book for you...  Get yourself a copy!<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of &quot;Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller&quot;
B00009TB5G|5.0|Before these films were released, I thought perhaps I was a \\"purist\\", but now I realize I am not after all.<br />I have read the Lord of the Rings books many, many times--the first time being over 30 years ago.  I loved them then, and I love them today.<br />But the films are not the books.  That does not lessen my enthusiasm for either.<br />As other reviewers have said--it's not possible in 9 hours to capture the complexity of the Rings trilogy.  I was initially distressed at the change that placed the elves at Helm's Deep, but considering that in the books the struggle of the elves and dwarves [and Men] within their own lands was barely a footnote, I suppose that the screenwriter wished to show that they were not really on the sidelines and the most expedient way to include them and to illustrate that was to have Elves march to the aid of the members of the Company. <br />[NOTE: for those who may have forgotten--silmultaneous with the battles and conflicts in the South which involved the Company {which Tolkien chose to describe in detail in these books}, the Dwarves and Lake Men in the North were also fighting for their lives and lands against hordes of orcs and goblins--as well as Legolas' father and their people in Mirkwood--AND the Elves of Lothlorien.  In the books, the elves were not able to send help because they were besieged and I disagree with the reviewer who believed that Tolkien intended the reader to think that the elves chose to remain on the sidelines and let the chips fall where they may.]<br />Anyway, as for the changes--it is sometimes nice to have a surprise or two and not have every aspect of the plot memorized before hand.<br />I sincerely believe the Two Towers beautifully follows the Fellowship and I don't think that even \\"purists\\" could possibly craft a more compelling adaptation, or create a more enchanting set, or cast more empathetic actors.<br />The films are magnificent.  In their own right.
0743455967|5.0|Unlike the plethora of books &quot;on writing&quot; that invade the marketplace every year - some good, some bad - Stephen King's &quot;On Writing&quot; isn't necessarily a how-to book.  It's more of an autobiography, with a special emphasis on King's development in the craft he is so well known for.<br />That said, &quot;On Writing&quot; is a beneficial book for writers because of its unique perspective.  What better way to learn more about a trade than to study the masters?  And Stephen King continues his fine writing career with this touching book, one that tells numerous tales of his early exploits with home-spun newspapers, his love of B-rate horror films and comic books, and his early attempts to write short stories.  After a number of self-proclaimed failures, King began to perfect his art and became a titan in the book industry.  The book follows his life all the way up to the car accident that almost claimed his life four years ago.<br />In addition to touching on the major events of his life, &quot;On Writing&quot; examines some of the writing techniques King uses.  How often he writes.  Where he writes.  It's all in here.  Overall, this is an intriguing book because it allows the reader to enter the workplace of a modern day literary giant, and the best stories are ones with larger-than-life characters!  Stephen King handles that role perfectly...  Five stars.<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of &quot;Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller&quot;
0440214041|5.0|This was such a cool book! (well, it's John Grisham, and of course it's cool!) See, I watched the movie, before I read the book, and I don't recommend that. always read the book first. But, the book was awesome! I'm a big John Grisham fan (who isn't?) and I loved this book! It's smart, funny-at times- suspenseful, and such a detailed &amp; awesome story!
B0000028W9|4.0|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Gets four stars from me. <br />LC is one of those singer-songwriters who seem to elicit strong opinions; there are those who really like him and those who can't stand him, but I haven't run across many who feel lukewarm about him either way. You'll rarely hear said about Leonard Cohen, \\"Yeah, he's ok.\\"<br />Accordingly, listening to any Leonard Cohen album should give one an idea of how they'll feel about him in general. This being a later album, it's more highly produced than the early albums, many of which have an almost raw sound to them. <br />I didn't like all the songs equally when I first listened to it, but repeated listenings have had nearly all of them grow on me to one degree or another. My least favorite is his cover of Irving Berlin's \\"Always\\", where Cohen tries to both undercut and transcend Berlin's cloyingly sentimental lyrics with a sly, lounge-lizard cool. Just doesn't work for me. <br />On the other hand, \\"Closing Time\\" utterly succeeds in pulling off the same trick in reverse; undercutting and transcending a  Country Top 40 sound with sneakily subversive lyrics, suggesting something just a wee bit more existential than just another tears-in-my-beer lament over a broken love affair. \\"Looks like freedom but it feels like death / it's something in between, I guess / it's closing time.\\" skirts dangerously close to the edge of Deep Thoughts. <br />\\"Waiting for the Miracle\\" is one of the standouts of the album, and certainly the darkest. It evokes a bleakness in the vein of an Ennio Morricone score for a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was used, in fact, as the opening theme for Oliver Stone's \\"Natural Born Killer's\\", which also used the album's title cut, \\"The Future\\", as it's closing credits theme. Another upbeat piece subverted by dark, jagged lyrics. <br />The other cuts are all good, with my personal other real standout being his \\"Anthem\\", which is as close to spiritual hopefulness as you're likely to hear LC get, a quiet, nearly peaceful ode to faith in the Good, and True. <br />If you like Leonard Cohen, you'll get him on this album, if you don't know him and want to check him out, this is as good an album as any of his to start with, and you'll certainly get to hear him in his stride. He hits it enough times here. <br /><><><><>
B000069AUI|5.0|Having wished other reviewers had done the same, I will mercifully dispense with the apparently obligatory history of my love affair with &quot;Parachutes&quot; and get to the goods.<br />&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is magnificent/exquisite/(insert pithy superlative). Coldplay have demonstrated a quantum leap forward in the space of one disc that few bands ever demonstrate over the course of a career. Whereas Parachutes was delicate, almost fragile, Coldplay have composed a stronger, far more consistent, exponentially more rewarding disc. At the conclusion of my first listen through the disc, I had the unique experience of pausing, staring at my stereo, and alternately uttering, &quot;Whoa,&quot; &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; and &quot;Amazing,&quot; among others. I suppose I feared the dreaded sophomore slump so greatly that I was completely unprepared for what I consider to be the greatness of this disc. <br />It's the consistent quality of the songs on this disc that amazes. &quot;Parachutes&quot; had great moments - &quot;Yellow,&quot; &quot;Spies,&quot; Everything's Not Lost&quot; - but also had weak points, e.g. &quot;Don't Panic&quot; and &quot;We Never Change.&quot; In contrast, &quot;A Rush . . . .&quot; is strong from the opening of &quot;Politik&quot; through the end of &quot;Amsterdam.&quot; &quot;Clocks,&quot; in fact, may be the most elegant song I've heard in years.  <br />Who knows, I may never listen to &quot;Parachutes&quot; again. (I have personal precedent - the first time I listened to Wilco's &quot;Summerteeth&quot; marked the last time I listened to &quot;A.M.&quot;)
0385504209|3.0|A riveting story and fascinating information about the Knights Templar, the Priory of Scion, Agnus Dei, and the Holy Grail. Some fun as you attempt to solve the puzzle clues along with the protagonists. But character development is mostly nonexistent, and the overuse of certain sentence structures (e.g., \\"Shedding his own suit coat and tie,\\" \\"Reconsidering,\\" and \\"Returning to the truck,\\" - all in the same paragraph) eventually starts to grate. Just sloppy writing, and apparently sloppy editing, which unfortunately can distract the reader.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is fresh, well-acted, and seamlessly plotted.  I recommend it to anyone seeking to escape the trash that pollutes our theaters in this summer of 2003.  <br />When I first realized that the movie was moving backwards (I had discussed this film with no one before I watched it), my gut instinct told me that I was in for a dreadful ride of post-modern esoteric nonsense.  Thankfully, my fears were unfounded--Memento hardly ever lapses into ontological rumination (think \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\"), and even begins to flow after a half hour or so.<br />Pearce acts his part of the short-term memory-lost angry guy seeking to avenge his wife's death very well.  He is surrounded by a group of excellent co-stars, the most notable of which is Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity from The Matrix).<br />This movie truly earns its 5 Stars.
0780020685|5.0|This is one of the very few movies that qualifies as a great work.  At 3.5 hours in length, containing a large number of interesting characters, a powerful plot, and brilliant cinematography, this movie has the complexity and impact of a great 19th century novel.  Kurosawa's great theme, which emerges in several of his other films, is the clash of traditions precipitated by social change in the anarchy of 16th century Japan.  This theme is confronted in various ways in scenes of remarkable humanity.  The acting in this movie is tremendous with memorable performances by the whole cast and truly great performances by all the major leads.  This film, made almost 50 years ago, is unsurpassed by anything made since then.
B000084T18|5.0|GRODT is of the Shizzle Hizzle. This CD rocks everthing.<BR>In da Club,Wanksta and other songs just kick it. So <BR>``Keep It Reel``

B00006L7XQ|5.0|This CD will be the one Johnny Cash is remembered for. The strong booming voice is gone now and what is left is a voice with character.. and what a voice. &quot;When The Man Comes Around&quot; is my personal favorite along with the remakes. His guitar playing has not mellowed and is as good as it ever was. I bought Rosanne Cash's new cd after hearing some of the songs and one song was done with her father. The duet was one of the best I've ever heard and led me to look for the recent release. Buy both and be happy.
B000050IE6|5.0|With 52 reviews before me, there is not much that I can say about this album that has not already been expressed.<br />I would have to say that the first time that I heard Opeth I was disgusted by the inhuman growls of Mikael Akerfeldt.  I didn't like the heavy sides of any of the songs, but I listened to it for the soft and melodic parts.  After listening to this album a few times I began to enjoy and love the heavy side.  This album is packed with raw emotion backed up with touching lyrics.<br />Opeth is a band that you really can't put a label on. They incorporate so many different influences into their music that you can't categorize them. They aren't just metal; combining everything from death metal, black metal, and folk music, Opeth are a very musically diverse band.<br />The album presents death metal verses that fall into beautiful acoustic pieces with clean vocals.  Opeth is trademarked by long, epic songs with lots of acoustics and unbelievable vocals and guitar riffs.<br />Opeth isn't about sadness; Opeth is about understanding the beauty that can be found in sadness.  Every Opeth album is an epic with a deep and emotional theme.  Still Life is about a man who is outcasted from his village for his religious beliefs. However after some 15 years he returns for his lover Melinda, only to see she is bequeathed to another man. Melinda decides to leave with this outcast of society, but before they escape Melinda dies.  After her death, the narrator goes berserk and dies valiantly in a bloody battle.  Still Life is about these lyrics were taken from Face of Melinda after Melinda died:<BR>      Darkness reared its head<BR>      Tearing within the reeling haze<BR>      Took control, claiming my flesh<BR>      Piercing rage, perfect tantrum<BR>      Each and every one would die at my hand<BR>      Choking in warm ponds of blood<BR>      At last, weak and torn I went down<BR>      Drained from strength, flickering breath<br />My point is that Still Life is not onlyepic, it's mythological.  I believe that this story is based upon Homer's epic &quot;The Odyssey.&quot;  They are a great number of similarities and I recommend that anyone who enjoys the story of Still Life to cliff note or read &quot;The Odyssey.&quot;  <br />This is a fantastic album that I can't see anyone disliking.  I recommend this album to any extreme metalhead, anyone who can see beauty beyond the demonic growls, and anyone who has a heart for poetry.
B00006GEXR|5.0|I loved the movie..even bought it!  I didn't like Hugh Grant as an actor but changed my opinion when I saw this picture.  He is a shallow lonely man who wakes up and realizes he needs people around him.  I especially loved the part on stage when Hugh belted out &quot;Killing me Softly&quot; and took an apple in the head to keep Marcus from getting laughed at later...you won't ever find a guy who would do that for a kid...the choices of music were really good...I plan to get the soundtrack...also...

0385720920|2.0|The style of this book is similar to Chuck's other books; schitzo, funny and obscene and surreal.  I like his style and this wasn't the problem with this book. The problem I had with this book is twofold. First, the mystery, surprise, \\"payoff\\" or whatever term you want to refer to the ending was weak in comparison to Fight Club, Survivor and Invisible Monsters.  In general the plot was just boring and all the usual interjections and interesting musings weren't enough to overcome the lack of a plot.  Stuff happens but it isn't really building up to something like in the other novels.  Second, Mancini is the hardest of Chuck's primary characters to relate to.  All of his main characters are extreme and outrageous but they all have some humane aspect about them we can relate to.  I thought Mancini was the most tired and unoriginal of the bunch and the sex addict bit was played out after Fight Club.  Also I didn't but the whole choking thing....how did he get his saviors to send him checks...would you send someone money just because you saved them from choking?<br />Bottom Line: funny in parts and Chuck fans should check it out.  If you are intereseted in Palahnuik, try any of the other 4 first.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I was rather dissapointed with the new Radiohead CD &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot;. Most of the music was reminiscent of techno and new age computer generated music, now I see why they singled &quot;There, There&quot; mainly because it was one of the few not totally digitalized songs on &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot;. If you like songs from Radiohead like Creep, Karma Police, or pretty much any song off all of Radiohead's previous albums then you probably won't like &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot;. I suggest going to a local store or your friend's and sampling the tracks. Most of them sound like the Radiohead song Ideoteque. I hope this review helps you, I didn't want to come out here and just shout and bash the album, I just wouldn't recommend it if you like old Radiohead.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is by far the best version of Robin Hood ever!  Anyone who purchases this classic will not be disappointed nor will they want to watch another actor ever play the part again.  Kevin Costner's version of Robin Hood pales in all comparison to the charisma, confidence, and style that Errol Flynn portrayed in this movie.  If I could of given this movie more than 5 stars I would have!
0811826848|5.0|this is a big book beautifully designed with a lot of photos that the beatles probably took themselves of eachother.<BR>the photo editing is excellent and the text is brilliant. this is a very heavy book so its not a carry-on-the-subway or plane type of read. a much more deliberate stay at home and examine peice of work.
B0000542DH|1.0|The movie had a great script.  The Actors were all noteworthy, and rightfully so, for the acting in this movie was superb.  Actually, everyone should rent this movie and fastforward to all scenes with Robert Downey Jr. who was absolutely fantastic.  Oliver Stone is a movie guru who does everything from writes to directs to produces.  All of these things put together should bring you a great movie, should it not?<BR>No, apparently it shouldn't.  The movie was ruined by one thing: Oliver Stone's attempts to make it artistic.  <BR>The satire was good, and everyone knows people like senseless violence, but not artistic senseless violence.  Basically, this is because senseless violence is not at all artistic.  Had the movie had more normal direction, the message still would've gotten across, like in &quot;Kalifornia.&quot;  If you want an artistic movie, check out &quot;Akira Kurosawa's Dreams.&quot;  If you want to be simultaneously confused, bored, disgusted, and most of all, dissapointed, watch Natural Born Killers.  Tarantino is my favorite screenwriter, and the script in its raw form is outstanding, but this movie is ruined.  Tarantino was furious with Oliver Stone for what he did to this script.  I would be too if my fantastic script was reduced to something so utterly bizarre...in a bad way.  And no, just because I don't like the movie doesn't make me a philistine.  It's just a terrible piece of cinema.
B000069HK2|5.0|it's pretty amazing how quickly the good name of the used has gotten out.  i remember first listening to their single, &quot;the taste of ink,&quot; on a local radio station and thinking that they'd probably be a great live band.  i was right.  if you think bert and the boys are awesome on their debut, you should definitely check them out live.  i'll be seeing them for the third time in six more days [warped tour], and there's no doubt in my mind that there will be thousands of others there especially for them.  even if you can't make it to a live performance, their current album should be enough to keep you occupied.  bert has an unforgettable voice that has the certain quality that keeps you listening.  i admit i wasn't that crazy about the cd when i first got it but you can bet i sing along with the tracks now, especially ones like &quot;a box full of sharp objects,&quot; &quot;greener with the scenery,&quot; &quot;bulimic,&quot; &quot;noise and kisses,&quot; and &quot;pieces mended,&quot; though all of the songs are incredible.  i don't know of anyone [with good taste] that doesn't agree.  this is definitely one of those cds that you'd pop in your car stereo and blast as loudly as possible, even if you are just parked in your driveway.
B00003CXSP|5.0|The second best since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS has Hannibal Lecter in the film,but he is mostly not a bad killer in the movie he is still into cannibalism.Julianne Moore was the best actress to take over Jodie Foster's role as Clarice.Anthony Hopkins was wonderful as Dr.Hannibal Lecter.the deaths are pretty bloody and the end was sick but cool when Hannibal cuts the man's head and makes him eats his own brains.This movie was the best.skip the 3rd one.

B00005JLYU|2.0|Apparently, nowadays to have a money making movie, you just need to add a cool name and some hot stars. This movie is a sequel to the 2001 movie Charlies Angels. Neither of these movies had the greatest plot but this one has the weakest. The movie starts out somewhere in Mongolia. Two of the angels are trying to rescue an important person held hostage while the other one rides a mechanical bull in a skimpy fluffy white dress. Moving in slo-mo for many scenes in the movie, this movie is usually hard to follow. The all-out action sequences are sometimes cool but get tiring after they repeat themselves. Sure the babes are hot but to keep an audience happy and pleased for an hour and a half you need a good plot to hold everything together...(a bikini strap doesn't count). This movie may be enjoyed if your just looking for some fun on a rainy afternoon but other than that I would avoid it at all costs.

B00008I8IF|5.0|Rainy Day Music is a delightfully wondrous musical opus that is radically different from the last group's effort in Smile. Where Smile was polished-sometimes to the point of being vastly overproduced-Rainy Day Music hearkens back to earlier sounds found in Sound of Lies and Tomorrow the Green Grass.<br />The cd lyrics are typical Jayhawk fare in that they are a cross between Eric Woolfson and Bernie Taupin. In short, Jayhawk lyrics are not vacuous but are very concise with plenty of bite and import. Consider this whimsical verse from \\"Save it for a Rainy Day\\":<br />\\"Pretty little hairdo don't do what it used to<br />Can't disguise the living<br />All the miles that you've been through<br />Looking like a train wreck<br />Wearing too much makeup<br />The burden that you carry<br />Is more than one soul could ever bear\\"<br />As for the feel of the music, consider it a cross between the Beatles' Rubber Soul and early James Taylor. There is a mellowness with a tangible bite to it pervading the entire 14 song set of disk one. (Disk 2 is a collection of rehearsals, live performances, and acoustic versions of songs past and present.)<br />Perhaps \\"All the Right Reasons\\" is the best song on the cd. Then again, \\"Will I See You in Heaven\\" may be tomorrow's favorite. There are truly no bad songs to be found on this album.<br />To any who have never heard the Jayhawks, consider that the group's last album must have impressed Stephen King since he alludes to works from Smile in Black House and From a Buick 8. For the King of Pop Culture to take a notice, the Jayhawks must be worth noticing.
B000089RVX|5.0|evanescence is perhaps one of the most incredible bands breaking into the music scene right now.  i've recently gotten into the &quot;goth-rock&quot; sound, and this band has kept me comfortably situated between music genres.  i hang my head in shame while admitting that i didn't think there was anything particularly special about them the first one hundred times i heard their first single, &quot;bring me to life,&quot; on the radio and mtv.  i honestly thought that though amy lee had an amazing voice, evanescence would be somewhat of a &quot;one-hit-wonder.&quot;  i could not have been more wrong.  <br />my friend burned the cd for me [hey, i'm a 16-year old with no job. . .thus. . .no money] and i listened to it once.  i guess i wasn't listening very well because i neglected to listen again, thinking that the album wasn't as great as my friend had built it up to be.  however, a few months ago, i had the privilege of seeing them live.  wow.  if you think amy and the guys are great on the cd, you should definitely see them live.  they sound even better and their passion for music is obvious.  not to mention, amy is gorgeous and should be the envy of all girls in america.  i think the greatest aspect of their show, however, was that people, who listened to music from different genres that attended that music festival, all knew the words to their songs.  it's not often you find a band that appeals to both goth kids and top 40 radio listeners.<br />needless to say, after that performance, i was captivated.  their sound is indescribable and amy's voice, uncomparable.  i seriously prefer staying at home singing along with her voice rather than going out.  okay, so that's really sad, but i think you get the idea.  anyway, if you don't already have &quot;fallen,&quot; shame on you.  if you're hesitant and not yet convinced, try downloading &quot;going under,&quot; &quot;my immortal,&quot; &quot;tourniquet,&quot; &quot;taking over me,&quot; and &quot;whisper&quot; to get anidea of evanescence's genius.  and if they ever stop in your city for a show, make sure you catch it, even if the ticket price is outrageously high.  you will definitely not be disappointed.
B00001U0DP|5.0|There are very few films you can watch in a foreign language with subtitles which will make you laugh out loud. Life is Beautiful will do so from beginning to end. Benigni is a motor-mouthed genius, the script and screen play devilishly inventive and impishly funny all the way along.<br />It's certainly no flat-out rib-tickler: The experiences of a Jewish Italian waiter and his family in a concentration camp could hardly be wall to wall slapstick. (Well, in Mel Brooks' capable hands, maybe - but Benigni has bigger fish to fry than Mel Brooks ever did.)<br />HOWEVER, I was not so taken with the Holocaust element. For one thing, the film is deliberately surreal and derives much of its humour from patently improbable situations: Benigni's character, a lovable wag, spends the entire film getting away with things which would throw any mortal into hospital, jail or a santitorium.  So there's inevitably an element of Hogan's Heroes about the Concentration Camp scenes. This is fine on the comedy level, of course, but it does undermine any more serious a points Benigni might be trying to make. And Life is Beautiful unquestionably does stoop to collect some cheap gravitas.<br />[Warning: Controversial View coming up:]<br />As an exercise in harrowing film-making, depicting the Holocaust is easy pickings. You don't need to be Spielberg or Polanksi to create an emotional wrecking-ball out of Dachau: the Nazis did that by themselves. You only have to have seen \\"The World At War\\" to realise that pure reportage of the Holocaust is horrifying enough without any dramatic push.<br />And, like it or not, Benigni does collect on this front.  I don't think that detracts from the excellence of this film - which is, after all about what a father will do for his family - but I think it considerably skews the Deep & Meaningful Index readout.<br />Which is to say is that Life is Beautiful is a standout piece of cinema because of its wit, not because of its treatment of the Holocaust. What's more, it's the better for that. Comedy is a much harder trick to pull off than high drama.more, it's the better for that. Comedy is a much harder trick to pull off than high drama.

B00005JM09|4.0|The Terminator films serve as the next evolution in the debate mankind has waged ever since the myth of Prometheus.  Technologys good and evil status has haunted and perplexed us from the moment we stepped out of the caves. In the Terminator films, technology, given too much power, sends us all back into the darkened primordial soup.<br />Human fate is what we make it is of the great themes present in TERMINATOR 3: THE RISE OF THE MACHINES. The hope we are ultimately in control of our fate and our technology is one of the underpinning messages making the violent and seemingly nihilistic fantasies of the Terminator film saga work.<br />Granted this third helping of Arnold wrecking things reminds us that the novelty of the new has long worn off this brilliant and durable franchise. This is really a small nitpick for the third installment delivers the promised thrills, blazing guns and honest heartfelt humanity. TERMINATOR 3 also bravely allows itself to go into DR. STRANGELOVE territory with a downbeat ending that brazenly bucks Hollywood trends while simultaneously setting the audience up for another sequel.<br />Such is the great paradox of the Terminator saga. While these films have pushed the technology of filmmaking to new extremes, pallid imitators have forgotten the humanity at the core of narrative. Technology, as any proud Luddite can tell you, is a Pandoras Box. Just remember at the bottom of the box lies the hope that mankind is wise enough not sacrifice itself at the throne of convenience and awe.
B00005N83M|5.0|I absolutely love this album from Ms. Lopez. It has a lot of songs on it that are great for partying to, and cool ballads as well. My favorite tracks on here are : Love Don't Cost A Thing, I'm Real(remix and original versions), Play, Walking On Sunshine, Cario, Ain't it Funny, Come Over, Dance With Me, Secretly, Dame,and Si Ya Se Acabo (both great Spanish tracks). I would definetly recommend buying this album if you like Jennifer's music, or if you just want a CD that you can party to.The duet with Chayanne and collaboration with Ja Rule make this a really cool collection of music. Trust me, you won't regret buying this, even if you don't like Jennifer Lopez.
B00007ELEL|5.0|There are two types of Coen brothers movies.  There's when the Coens decide to challenge the analytical part of the mind (Barton Fink, Fargo, Miller's Crossing, The Man Who Wasn't There) and there's the lighter side of the Coens (O Brother Where Art Thou, Raizing Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy).  <br />This, my friends, is the latter.<br />And in my humble opinion....their funniest movie to date!<br />Yes, this means that I'm ranking it above O Brother (which is, according to Joel C., \\"the most expensive three stooges movie ever made\\").  What, you don't agree?<br />Okay, let me put this straight.<br />Well, there's The Dude.  And you may not realize it, but he is a private detective in the leanest sense of the word, pure base concept here...but make no mistake, he is a true gumshoe in the likes of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe.  Here he is, just a regular....well, dude.  Minding his own business when two hired thugs break into his apartment thinking he's the Big Lebowski (he's not, but he is named Lebowski) and relieve themselves on his rug...a rug that \\"tied the whole room together.\\"  Now he isn't going to sit still for that, not after his good friend played by John Goodman goads him.  So he's off to see the Big Lebowski for a replacement rug, but gets caught up in a botched kidnapping and the weirdness ensues.<br />Here the Coens use every cliche in the old detective noir genre.  The respected politician (who is corrupt underneath his philanthropic veneer).  The local sheriff who disrespects him.  The creepy henchmen.  The seductive mistress.  The humorous sidekick.  The odd bit of tragedy.  The only things missing are fedoras and trenchcoats.<br />Plus, you get the Coens' hallucinogenic imagery.  The \\"bowling porno\\" dream sequence should be considered a moment of new Hollywood legend.  The nude abstract painting of Maude.  The euro-techno freaks and their pet ferret.  <br />For a few bucks, the price of a movie and popcorn, treat yourself to a movie you're sure to enjoy.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I think that this is a great effort as a debut album coming from Jennifer. The songs are really cool and catchy, and it's really easy to get into them. I really love Let's Get Loud because it's so energetic and is a great track for a party. No Me Ames is another great track. The tropical remix version is better than the ballad version. The collaboration with Marc Anthony is amazing, and the two sound really good together. Feelin' So Good with Big Pun and Fat Joe is also another great party track and the collaboration is also cool. The first single, If You Had My Love is always a cool song, as well as Waiting For Tonight because when you hear them, it's really hard not to get into them. I would definitely recommend buying this because it has really cool music. It's a great addition to any CD collection, whether or not you like Jennifer.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is a very good CD! Pink made a comeback with this one! Even though \\"Cant take me home\\" was better, \\"M!SSUNDAZTOOD\\" still stands out. \\"Don't let me get me\\" and \\"Just like a Pill\\" are my favorites. BUY THIS CD! SUPPORT PINK!
B000099T2L|5.0|I was a little hesitant about buying this album at first because I didn't know if it was going to be as good as all the hype about it. I'm really good that I got this because the songs are really good. There are a lot of ballads that have a lot of feeling. Collaborations with Jay-Z, Sean Paul, Luther Vandross, and Big Boi from Outkast make the album really cool. I really love the tracks Crazy In Love, Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, Hip Hop Star, Yes, That's How You Like It, and Dangerously in Love Pt.2 (although it sounds just like the original on Survivior). The beats are all cool, the lyrics are mature, and I think that Beyonce' will become an even bigger star than she is right now. If  you're a fan of Destiny's Child, then you should probably go get this album along with the ones from Kelly and Michelle. You won't be disappointed if you get this. The music is too cool to miss. It has a lot of feeling and maturity. I really enjoy listening to this during my free time. It's really hot, and if you don't have this album then you don't know what you're missing because this is a great CD.
B000000IUK|5.0|\\"The Joshua Tree\\" is, in my opinion, among one of the best albums ever. The weight and gravity inherent in each song, accompanied by the effervescent ambiance that strings each track together, is something not readily found in music. The first thing that one notices after repeated listenings to this album is that for everyone who listens to \\"The Joshua Tree\\" there are just as many journeys and stories heard and told.  This isn't an album built around cliches or \\"traumas\\" - it's an album that, at the core, is very spiritual and purging. Some songs can be taken at face value - \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" can be seen as a song about the heart of the eternal beat/bohemian, just as well as it can be seen as the story of an empoverished country, beautiful and decayed. \\"With Or Without You\\" can be seen as a love story fated to pain, failure and loss; it can also be seen as a song about death or even, on some levels, promiscuity and drug-addiction. Each song on this album can be put to scrutiny, and each song, in the end, winds up being an enigma; an obsidian shard of beauty and pain, truth and redemption. I can go on and on, but the point is, whoever you happen to be, from whatever class, race, religion, creed, sex - if you want to take a journey that's much deeper than today's ordinary music fare, a journey that taps into the mass consciousness as well as sub-consciousness, pick up \\"The Joshua Tree\\". In my opinion, art isn't what's created, but what's seen through the eyes of the spectator, the common individual, the ordinary man and woman, the person who is open and vulnerable enough to notice true beauty and embrace it. This is what this album helps you do.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Appropriately the very first big budget superhero movie, SUPERMAN delivers and still entertaining after 20 plus years. In widescreen, a couple of scenes added and a couple of scenes trimmed, the movie works on all levels of a straight adventure film with action, pathos and a love story.  Watch the movie on video and it flows better without all the network commercial interruptions.  One complaint from some fans is the Lex Luthor character played with camp by Gene Hackman, but it isn't too bad as there is still a lot of evil and a diabolical demeaner in all the campiness. From the origin (from Krypton)to the young Clark Kent (Jeff East) in Smallville explored briefly but effectively, the film is faithful to the comicbook legend. One notable scene lifted from Star Wars (Luke Skywalker looking out to the horizon of the two suns of Tattooine) young Clark Kent looks out to the horizon past the wheatfields of his farm. The great performance in the film has to from Christopher Reeve playing both Clark Kent and Superman and the duality of the character. It is not necessarily Clark Kent merely taking off his clothes and flying away in the Superman suit.  You actually believe these are two different people as shown in the comic books. The special effects still past muster for its time and all the characters are excellent. The DVD version trims some footage and restores some deleted footage. For example, they trimmed a few minutes of the awkward military sequence with actor Larry Hagman, and edited out a reference to a prisoner who bed wets (in a prison scene with Luthor and Otis played by Ned Beatty), perhaps to be politically sensitive, and they added more of the Marlon Brando as Jor-El's spirit talking to Superman in the Fortress of Solitude. A classic film overall.  The DVD also has extras like the screen tests for various parts.
B00008VGK0|4.0|Those who claim that Madonna's jumping on a bandwagon by having Missy Elliot do a remix of this track must not be terribly knowledgeable of her musical history as her EROTICA disc featured the &quot;Did You Do It?&quot; rap and Everlast did vocals on a remix of &quot;Waiting&quot; from the same album, in addition to Me'shell Ndege Ocello's rap on &quot;I'd Rather Be Your Lover&quot; from the BEDTIME STORIES disc.  All that being said, the Missy Elliot remix is an enjoyably funky take on the song, but isn't representative her strongest solo work.  Paul Oakenfold's mix is the highlight here, a great groove as usual.  Felix Da Housecat's mix is enjoyable, and Peter Rauhofer's anthem's are standard club fare.  Also included is another mix of &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, and while it can't compare to the Dirty Vegas mix on the DAD maxi, it's still a good listen.  Though it isn't a brilliant collection of mixes, it's still one of those rare maxi's you can listen to from front to back and enjoy the whole thing.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'd say I was a fan of At-The-Drive-In... I'd even say I was upset to hear that they broke up when they did... But,from<BR>death comes life and The Mars Volta is it! This CD NEEDED to come out to kick others in the [behind]where they needed a good kicking. I bought this album on a chance with out hearing anything from it.. I'm going to tell everyone that reads this that it's probably the best cd purchase I've made in 3 years. It's soooo Amazing. My opinion of it is, that if Pink Floyd met At-The-Drive-In, you'd get THE MARS VOLTA!!![.] BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!![.]
B00008S2VH|4.0|Like the GHV2 limited edition, this does not differ at all in musical content, just the packaging.  But it is a nice set, all in all: a sturdy, oversize box features the Madonna as Che cover but minus the title art on the cover and the rear is covered in a black cloth.  Inside you'll find a set of postage sized stamps featuring the album art as well as a roughly 23 x 35 poster featuring the cover photograph on one side, and a collage spelling out Madonna American Life on the other, as well as one smaller corner featuring album info.  The disc itself also features different artwork than the regular release.  Invest the extra dough if you're a Madonna fan and a collector of her work, otherwise if you want the disc the standard version will do just fine.  Musically the album veers between sounding interestingly raw and just plain unfinished.  If you enjoyed her 2000 release MUSIC, than you should also enjoy this one.  Ignore the first two singles, which are good if not great, and dig into the real meat of the album with the songs &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;X-Static Process&quot;.  The one is DEFINITELY much better than many american critics have given it credit for.
0684823454|5.0|Winston Churchill's autobiography of his early life is an engrossing and informative read. After reading other biographies of Churchill it is interesting to get the story from the Churchill himself. In addition to learning about Churchill's youth, one gets a portrait of late Victorian England, a world that no longer exists.<BR>The opening chapters are amusing as Churchill humorlessly recalls his difficult days in the British public school system. The middle section covers his military career in India and Africa. It is hard to understand Churchill's zest for war in today's climate. Europe had not seen the destruction total war could wrought. It is miracle he survived all the engagements he took part in. As Churchill points out most believed there would never be a major war at that time and war was still considered to be romantic. He sadly points out that most his former comrades would killed in the Boer War and the First World War. The chapters on Churchill's escape from the Boer POW camp are a real treat. <BR>\\"My Early Life\\" is one of the finest autobiographies I have read. One can see why Churchill was awarded a Nobel Prize for literature. His command of the English language is masterful. What gives added relevence to this book is that it was written in the 1920s, little did Churchill know that he would play a central role in stopping Hitler and becoming one of the world's finest spokesman for freedom.
B00005T5VE|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, it doesn't differ in musical content from the regular version, but does offer snazzier packaging: a hard cover encloses the booklet and disc, the booklet offers slightly different artwork (mostly more photographs)and the disc itself has different artwork.  This is a good version for the dyed in the wool Madonna fan, and the collection of songs is really a must have in any form.
B000089A07|4.0|The movie actually holds exactly to the book unlike its predecessor, Manhunter, which was filmed in the mid-80's.<BR>Out of the trilogy of movies, I would rank Red Dragon a 7.5 compared to Silence's 10 and Hannibals 5.5. Hannibal is not<BR>the villian here in this movie, but has a somewhat important part helping the lead character. One other note, &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is also not as grotesque as &quot;Hannibal&quot;, which some found over the top. Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes do a superb job with their characters roles as does Anthony Hopkins, who has a small amount of screen time. Highly Recommended!
B000001FJV|5.0|Not as good as LOVE POWER PEACE, but still very nice for quiet mornings.  Makes a good wedding gift (particularly the track, &quot;Brand New Day&quot;).
0783229364|5.0|This is a great exemple of what happens to the business today, the movie itself is great, with the image of the &quot;white knight&quot; American who save the corporation. I in a academic point of view find the concept hysterical, even more if you look at corporation today! We might need more Brantly Foster around.<br />Anyway Micheal J. Fox Rules!
B00008WT49|5.0|My tastes are usually old fashioned and eclectic enough (a capella, classical, swing, oldies) that the &quot;chart toppers&quot; section of the record store has no appeal for me. Likewise, there are very few of the winners at the Grammys whose songs I have even HEARD of, let alone listen to willingly. Until I had heard Norah Jones' material, I mentally grouped her with so many of the singer/songwriter females that have come into prominence recently and figured I wouldnt' enjoy it. I was obviously wrong. First, &quot;Don't know Why&quot; got stuck in my head-- overplayed as it is-- and I really liked it. I also saw the video for &quot;Come away with me&quot; on tv at some point and thought... &quot;two good songs? I might have to check this out.&quot;<br />I ordered the CD and I haven't been disappointed. She reminds me of the lovely Eva Cassidy, whose career was tragically cut short. It's so nice to hear someone young performing older songs and new songs with an emphasis on good melodies, good singing and lots of emotion. Her soulful renditions are quietly calming and perfect for summer driving music. She's a permanent addition to my car's cd player. Some songs are better than others, but that only shows her versatility in performing a variety of styles.<br />Great job, Norah! Keep 'em coming!
6304872402|5.0|This movie is the best Disney movie i have seen in a long time! Who cares if it is not &quot;historically accurate?&quot; It is a movie made for kids to enjoy. Even though I am not a kid, i still enjoy this movie. It shows the struggle of a young woman trying to figure out her past.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I am a huge fan of Star Trek: TNG. The series made for compelling television. The movies, aside from First Contact, have been lackluster and seemingly lost in the mythos that they are trying to portray. Star Trek is about a journey, new horizons, and ultimately, family. Whereas Nemesis adequately protrays the latter element admirably, the rest of the story gets bogged down in continuity issues and lame attempts to squeeze every member of the TNG into every possible camera shot, whether they should be in the scene or not. This is not to say that Nemesis is a bad film, as science-fiction films go. On the contrary, it stands on its own when taken only as a \\"science-fiction\\" movie. Star Trek fans want more than that. But knowing that in \\"All Good Things\\" Troi actually marries Worf (not to mention that in the Star Trek timeline he was assigned to DS9 AND wound up being an ambassador in All Good Things) it makes the major emotional points of the film pale slightly. We can never invest in the Riker/Troi marriage knowing that it should not actually happen, but nevertheless, it is still a Trek film. Tom Hardy is more than adequate as the sinister Shinzon. And the special effects are very well done. I had just hoped that the beloved crew of the Enterprise had been granted a more graceful sendoff.
0316666343|5.0|Once I started this, it was one of the hardest books to put down. It combines a murder mystery with the high emotional content of a teenager's viewpoint on life and death. The narrator is a 14 year old girl who has been murdered. After her death, she can see her family from heaven as they struggle through life after the tragedy. She stays 14 as her family ages. This book is thrilling and emotional, but full of insights.
B00005JKZV|5.0|If Peter Jackson had tried to set the events leading up to RoTK any better he would not have succeeded. As sequels go, The Two Towers, save The Empire Strikes Back, is the finest example of \\"follow me I have something incredible to show you\\" filmaking I have ever seen. While much darker and more violent than FoTR, The Two Towers still carries great emotional weight, and stuns the viewer with intricate battle sequences interspersed with genuinely heart-felt and touching moments. Everything about this film screams quality. The performances are outstanding, and with the addition of Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill, the Middle Earth family is complete. The opening sequence is breathtaking. The battle for Helm's Deep is absolutely astonishing (eventhough the purists rail at the idea of Haldir coming to the rescue). The Ents march on Isengard is something that will be remembered for years to come. The mounting tension as Frodo and Sam race to destroy the ring grows with each passing second. Frodo's inner turmoil is superbly protrayed by the more than capable Elijah Wood. Aragorn is becoming King, with each passing second, and Peter Jackson is sharp enough to make it hard to notice. Everything about this movie just feels right. But Gollum steals the show. Andy Serkis is incredible, and he breathes so much life into the CG character that you quickly forget that Gollum is not actually a real person. All in all The Two Towers surpasses the Fellowship of the Ring, in almost every aspect. This viewer cannot fathom the wonders that Peter Jackson has in store us in The Return of the King. HIGHLY recommended.
6305696071|5.0|Got the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD for Pretty Woman. At the beginning, the message looks spooky: &quot;This film has been modified from its original version and edited for content.&quot; At first glance, that looks like Full Screen (Oh No!) and censored (ditto).<br />But the wide screen is still there. And director Marshall explains how each specific scene left out of the theatrical version was put back in for the laser disk and the DVD. So now I feel better and think that it was really worth my money to buy this DVD and spend the time watching the film again twice (including one for the director's commentary).<br />Other reviewers have expounded on what a great film it is. Without repeating what has already been said, I give my overall feeling: comic, well-paced, uplifting. Shows that there is hope regardless of current status in life. Glad they didn't include that choice of an ending where he leaves her and Kit dies of OD. Definitely one of my top 40 films of all time.
0553378384|5.0|I have been interested in astrology all my life, and have recently begun in-depth study.  As part of my journey in knowledge, I found I wanted to know a lot more about the North Node, and the message and lessons it imparts.  Jan Spiller's book is giving me great guidance in this area.  I highly recommend it to any astrological student, but especially anyone wanting to learn about the North Node.
B000002JEV|5.0|Can't add much more to what's already been said. However, I will say that while Zep BBC is one of the best things I've heard in years, you should also look into any number of other BBC sessions (Cream,  Yardbirds,etc.)  Perhaps the second best of the bunch (second to Zeppelin) is Rory Gallagher BBC Sessions.  Wow. I knew these guys were good, but these sessions are so stripped down and raw. It's like nothing else.
0201485672|5.0|Do not be fooled by the title:  This book works just as well as a style guide for class design in new development as it does for rewriting existing code.  The writing is easy to understand, and the examples are kept simple for clarity.  It works well both as a reference and as a cover-to-cover read. The book also helped illuminate many design patterns.  The only downside:  After reading this book it was almost painful to go back and &quot;smell&quot; my own code.  But I immediately set about refactoring, with tremendous results.  This book is a &quot;must-have.&quot;
B00000F169|4.0|I originally had this film on a Beta cassette, so<BR>I can say it found me early.  My first thoughts<BR>were &quot;Hippies in Space&quot;.  This is a microcosism<BR>of the world around the time they started the film.
B000001FOL|4.0|Nico, formally of the Velvet Underground, and her first solo album &quot;Chelsea Girl,&quot; together, respectively, are phenomenal. I first became a Nico fan after listening to the &quot;Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; banana album, and have thought of this particular CD ever since as a favorite. Though I cannot label it with 5 stars, because this album is definitely not the kind of music that you can listen to around the clock without sinking into a deep and comatose-like depression, it definitely samples a wide range of sounds that can be labeled as almost nothing truly, save the epitaph, &quot;underground.&quot; Unlike Dylan's &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde,&quot; two of the greatest albums of our time, it requires a dark, yet whimsical state-of-mind, and one can picture little Nico in a kerchief and petticoats, singing these elegies in a dark castle in Germany. It's just that kind of record. <br />Though almost all of the cuts are characteristically sanguine, there is the sorrowful look at drug-abused youths,&quot;Chelsea Girls,&quot; and the elegiac &quot;Ballad of Lenny Brown,&quot; which, in addition to their gothic musical arrangements, to not conjure happy and peaceful thoughts. Most of the songs are particularly catchy and hopeful, though they still seem to be hiding some clandestine pain, like Nico herself was. The highlight of the CD is definitely &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons,&quot; a fanciful melody about an ambivalent Nico who finally decides &quot;that I'll be leaving in the fairest of the seasons.&quot; Also great on &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; is the Dylan cover &quot;I'll Keep It With Mine,&quot; which, along with &quot;Somewhere There's a Feather&quot; seem to guide the listener to the correct path, even though Nico's childish voice seems to be almost mocking her wisdom-ladened advice. This is a feeling I get throughout the album, that Nico seems to be almost mocking herself, an idea that she remedies on her secondalbum, which is decidedly more hard-core. This album is very good, and I don't think that anyone could pull off Nico's admonishing songs, except a character like Nico, who has seen it all, and realizes she has made mistakes, though this is observed silently. Perhaps, fundamentally, this album is really about Nico's regrets.
B000005RFQ|5.0|it always surprises me how many so called black sabbath fans disregards this album as ... .i must admit i am not a deep purple/ian gillian fan but gillian really shines on this cd.his vocals  on this cd is truly great.tony iommi plays some of his best music on this album.he's guitar playing on zero the hero,digital b..ch and hot line is truly fantasic.my favorite tracks on this cd are trashed ,disturbing the priest,hot line,born again well every song on this album is my favorite.even the two instrumental tracks stonehenge and the dark are cool.this is a truly must have cd for any fan of great heavy metal.in my opinion it will be hard to find a better metal cd than this even though sabbath's headless cross,eternal idol and volume 4 may come close.my advice is to buy born again and enjoy the best heavy metal /hard rock album you will ever hear.

B000099T2L|5.0|1. Crazy in Love-too much Radio Play, but on the whole a great song to start the cd off with, and a club hit, good to dance to.<br />2. Naughty Girl-one of my favorites!!! I love how she mixes old and new school for something original and sexy.<br />3. Baby Boy-probably my least favorite song, but it's not bad, just typical radio friendly song.<br />4. Hip Hop Star- OutKast always brings something fresh to a song, and it's a song like no one has ever heard before which is refreshing, very HOTTTTT<br />5.Be With You-it's ok, nothing too memorable for me but not a bad song<br />6.Me, Myself and I-you gotta listen to this one, and once you do, you can appreciate B as a real lyricist and great songwriter.<br />7.Yes-once again another example of good storytelling through songs, something that DC and now solo Beyonce will come to be known for<br />8.Signs-Missy mixes it with her newly signature \\"rewind\\"-but it's a hot song anyway, missy and B make a good songwriting pair.<br />9.Speechless-my ABSOLUTE favorite song on this album...it  leaves you speechless, Beyonce realizes less is more sometimes<br />10.That's how you like it-tribute to coupledom for B and Jay, cute.<br />11. Closer...-tribute to old school and bringin Luther!!  Beyonce, I didn't know you had it like that!<br />12. Dangerously..-from the Survivor album but stands out on this one as well as the title track and onrunning theme throughout the cd.<br />13. Gift from Virgo-in case you didn't get it...she's in love!!!<br />14. Daddy-I cried, simple as that...<br />Overall a great album to chill to, not necessarily one to dance to but a fabulous cd none the less.
B000069HK2|5.0|This is an awesome freggin' CD.They have tons of talent,when he screams it gives you goose bumps.This is an awesome CD.It's good to see a band thats not a pop/punk band thats in mainstream.Everyone should get this CD its great.
B000089CJI|5.0|A friend on mine got me this cd a couple of days ago. I havent stopped listening to it. It is probably the coolest CD that I've had for a long time. The music is really different, relaxing, but still upbeat. I absolutely love The Postal Service, and I hope they come out with a new CD soon. If your looking for something new, and underground, definetly get this CD.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Just brilliant. One of cinema's most beautiful tributes to itself, full of bittersweet tenderness and irony. Swanson is fabulous, and watching Von Stroheim portraying his own decadence with such sober dignity makes my heart bleed. The most beautiful ghost movie ever made. Watching it is like dreaming of loved ones long gone : in those dreams that everybody experiences every once in a while, the ones you love come back from the dead just for a short while, and you want to talk to them, hear them say that they return to stay, but they are vague, distant, blurry, they say that they can't stay, that it's not allowed, and they speak to others that you can't see, they know something that they can't tell, and just when you thought they were back for good, they disappear again, ignoring your cries. That's what this movie does. It's the final curtain call of legends of the past, to whom this movie gave the opportunity to take one last bow, as if saying : &quot;it was good, but we are no more - take a good look at us, it's the last one you'll ever have&quot;.
B00005JLO2|3.0|I really anticipated watching the newest adaptation of A.E.W Mason's classic story Four Feathers, for several reasons. Being such a classic story, of love, colonialism and redemption, I found it surprising to be the first adaptation since 1939!, so with Shekar Kapur as a director, with films like Bandit Queen and Elizabeth to his credit, it must turn out to be a classic.<BR>Moreoever, epic historical films are few and far between these days, and cinema lovers can do with a bit of that once in a while.Yet I am sorely disappointed with the film.Although the direction acting and photography are good, the battle scenes in particular,there is still something missing,a major element in any genre which I personally found lacking here,connection and sympathy with the characters! There was none.I really did not care what happened to the characters,and midway through I found the troubles and suffering of the lead character played by Heath Ledger a bit annoying, instead of the supposed sympathy that I should have felt for him.<BR>While Kate Hudson is a talented actress, I think she was miscat for the role. While she did a good job and managed her role well,and did an excellent accent, there is something too 'Californian' sunny and fresh about her appearance,and definitely non Victorian.<BR>The British colonial past has been filmed many times, (my favorites still are the classic The Man Who Would Be King and Zulu) but the treatement of the subject varied greatly,from sympathetic to the objective to the politically correct,but it is up to the viewer to deduce his/her own conclusions, while it is up to the filmmakers to ensure that they will grab the viewer's attention  and entertain him/her as well (The age of the Bergmans and Tarkovskys is over, while they were excused for not aiming at entertaining the viewer, but rather challenge him/her intellectually, it is the expection and not the norm).This what I found lacking in Four Feathers.<BR>Having said that, the DVD is of very good quality and it has many extras that unfortunately I found more interesting than the film itself.
1400034779|4.0|This book is reminiscent to me of Tony Hillerman's books, in that we are taken into the lives of a different type of people with their own way of dealing with a different kind of lifestyle that we are not familiar with, only instead of the four-corner area of the southwest, we are in Botswana, Africa.  The story is not one of a thriller packed with action, but of a No.1 lady detective (the only one) who is approached by various customers to look into mundane to serious cases in her area.  It is a relaxing, funny, sad and thought provoking book.  It gives the reader a look at life in Botswana that is entertaing and informative and leaves you wanting to learn more.  There aren't many fiction books on life in Africa that is available to the average citizen  that is this enjoyable.  You have a relaxed, good feeling when you finish the book.
B000066AXC|2.0|This should have won the Oscar for Best Non-Threatening Based on a True Story with Great Actors in a very predictable anti-climatic film (Exhale!). Seriously how did the critics not expose this film for what it truly was. It's been mentioned many times but this film was \\"Oscar bait\\" in every sense of the words (Even more than Forrest Gump which won over the inspiring Shawshank Redemption, the groundbreaking Pulp Fiction, the delightful Four Weddings and A Funeral, and the moral,thought provoking Quiz Show). The movie's only merits is the great camera work and Jennifer Connelly (who was the only character I felt for). I can't believe the same guy who made the tense and entertaining \\"Apollo 13\\" and EdTV (I like that film for some reason- maybe for it's honesty, which this film lacks) made this \\"everything-by-the-rules\\" movie. I admit the first half was good, but the second part was just boring and totally unrealistic for being a so-called \\"Based on a True Story\\". It would of been way better if the movie would of focused on Alicia more than on John Nash. At least then it wouldn't have succumbed to making the movie do that awful part with the speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony (How predictable and cheesy). Even though I was throwing out negative thoughts, I think for the most part it is an ok movie. But to think that this was the best of 2001 over *insert the film you believed was the actual best film of that year* is totally unoriginal and just following a shallow view. Totally did NOT deserve all of the accolades it recieved. (Wait \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" won over \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" at the British Oscars. Justice has prevailed! Well thankfully they didn't fall for the same garbage that they fell for on this side of the Atlantic)
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie \\"strikes-a-chord\\" with teens everywhere. This is the epiotomy of what high school life is all about. Listen-up kids, will you raise your hand as I call out your name:...Jack?...(here!)... John?...(here!)...Billy?...(here!)...Bob?...(here!) BUELLER? (not here, of course)...Frye?...Frye?...Has anyone seen FRYE? Oh yeah, we saw him with this hot chick at \\"31 Flavors\\" the other night. No. Acutually, he's at home in bed contemplating getting off his....as to whether he'll pick-up Ferris and his girlfriend Sloane taking them to someplace cool, free from the doldrums of high school. This voodoo economics quiz will begin in.... Ok, you can all put your #2 pencils down. There's no homework assignment, for today. (OH, YEAH!!! YIPPEE!!!) The bell just rang and schools out. As you hurry to pick up your things and head for home, you can't wait to wait pop this DVD in, to watching a teen-classic: \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\\"<br />There's a whole lot of controversey swirling-around the student-body, when there're rumors that Ferris has had his 9th sick-day of the school-year. Can you believe it? Niether can we. How does a sneaky son-of a.....like Ferris get away with it. I'm getting so jealous of this......getting anything he wants, to having everything under-the-sun: driving around town in these exotic-cars; fast-women (to fulfill his every freakin' whim); and the friendly town's people (who are more than willing to let-go and forgive, for all the mistakes he makes throughout his adolescense). Why can't he be like the rest of us losers out there: who are constantly getting our lunch money stolen from the jocks on the football team, who are there for the sole-purpose of puting shaving-cream down our gym shorts; and to the stupid cheerleaders (heartless wenches) who repeatedly refuse our invitations to go on a date with us to the \\"Junior Prom.\\" We all have to go class unlike Ferris, lest we go to detention and/or summer school. We hate summer school, it sucks bigtime! Frankly, we're getting sick and tired of it. Therefore, we're all looking-up to you...Ferris, as our hero to serve as an example for all the injustices that take place in our school. Go on! Have a good time with your friends! We don't care as long as you guys promise us, you'll be back in time to take us to the stomp. <br />Meanwhile, as the trio rolled into Downtown Chicago with the Ferarri's controls at Ferris' fingertips, with his steady girlfriend Sloane at his side, and a buddy Cameron who's  reluctant to relinquish his daddy's most prized-possession, they're on their way - to bim, bombay! This is going to be a funfilled day at the parade, horray! On to the muesems we go, to see a litte bit of Warhol, Picasso, and Van Goh. From the Chicago Stock Exchange, to the breath-taking views of the city from the top of the Sears Tower. These extra-curricular activities are making us all hungry, as we get a bite to eat with the \\"Sausage King of Chicago\\" that is. SO CLAP YOUR HANDS TOGETHER, AND MAKE SOME NOISE!!! For this is the best movie by far, I give it ***5-stars***.
0792839730|3.0|You have to admire trying to make a commercial movie out of a lost battle.  This movie has some very good performances and some wonderful images.  Yet, somehow it feels like it could have been and should have been more.  It feels less than the sum of its parts.<br />For example, Anthony Hopkins as Lt. Col. John Frost is one of the best things in the movie.  Who doesn't love the cheeky refusal to surrender by telling the Germans that Frost and his hopelessly outnumbered English soldiers simply don't have the facilities to accept a German surrender?  And Hopkins' wordless performance when the German officer comes to the remnant of the force at Arnhem is just wonderful.  There are many other such performances and images in this film.<br />Although, why they went box office and had Redford win a battle that the British Grenadiers actually won is still something I find irritating.  But that is a whole other debate.<br />My own view is that the biggest problem is the sprawling way the story is told.  In trying to get everyone and everything on the screen more gets lost than told.  Somehow the narrative thread of the story needed to be tighter and more direct.  If the story needed to be told on such a grand scale maybe it would have been better told as a good mini-series.  The movie is almost three hours and jumps around a lot.  We get to follow a lot of threads, but none of them deeply.<br />I would have preferred a couple of stories standing in for the whole battle and followed them closely than get ten on screen minutes of the underground family with the fourteen year old son.  Of course, that family was standing in for even more families in the underground and their tragic story adds pathos to the tale.  But we want more with them than we get and that is true with every story in the film.  I guess I am saying that the movie needed to be pared down and given greater focus (not shortened necessarily) or expanded beyond the bounds of a theatrical movie.<br />While all movies are a product of the time they are made rather than the time portrayed in the movie, this one also seems particularly caught up in the post-Vietnam malaise and anti-war sentiment.  Not that many are pro-war, it is that some reluctantly understand that wars do come and others reject that under all circumstances.  In 1977 the latter view held sway.<br />This DVD is not a carefully restored reproduction of the film.  It contains some image problems that a digital re-mastering could have fixed.  But this film wasn't a commercial success and the judgment was probably made that the DVD didn't warrant extra investment.<br />All in all I am glad I own the DVD and will watch it every now and again, particularly to see the English actors.  Their performances here are superior.movies are a product of the time they are made rather than the time portrayed in the movie, this one also seems particularly caught up in the post-Vietnam malaise and anti-war sentiment.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is a great follow up to Hybrid Theory and Reanimation. The album's first single, Somewhere I Belong is an amazing song. And it isn't even the best song on the album. Every song is fantasic. Here is a breakdown of each track.<BR>1. Foreword- a good, short intro to the album. goes along great with track 2. 8/10 <BR>2. Don't Stay- This song proved that Linkin Park is back to their usual stuff. Great up tempo beat. Great lyrics. 9/10<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong- Amazing song.

Great vocals, lyrics, and background music. 8.5/10<BR>5. Hit The Floor- Great song. Reminds me of &quot;Myself&quot; from Hybrid Theory.

Not very fast and uptempo, but it's great. The instrumental sets like a sort've like emotional song. 9/10<BR>7. Faint- The best song on the album. The opening instrumental is incredible.

B0000041Q3|5.0|To the San Diego opera buff. I admire your passion for Kirsten Flagstad. She is also one of my favorite soprano for all time, along with Dame Joan Sutherland. <br />This should be of interest to you. One of Sutherland's favorite singer happens to be Flagstad. La Stupenda  mentioned it in her laserdisc &quot;La Stupenda&quot;. She is also a big admirer of the great Maria Callas, whom she mentioned over twenty times in her autobiography &quot;A Prima Donna's Progress&quot;. Dame Joan is perfectly aware that without the work of La Divina, 20th Century bel canto would not have been possible. So the many assaults upon her by some Callas fans is not only ironic but uncalled for.<BR>But even more interesting is this...I'm sure you know that the &quot;New York Post&quot; is a very respectable paper.<br />Here is a direct quote from the famed critic Harriet Johnson's comments about Dame Joan Sutherland's voice in the &quot;New York Post&quot;...<br />&quot;...Her voice - a true, dramatic coloratura - and her effortless use of it are phenomenal. In my experience, I have heard only one singer to compare with her in vocal greatness, the late Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad, whose voice in a completely different genre - a real dramatic soprano - was also miraculously beautiful and effortless. Today, Miss Sutherland has no peer.&quot;<br />Even the most ardent Callas and Sills fans have to admit that Kirsten Flagstad's voice is consider one of the wonders of this operatic century. She is consider the greatest Wagnerian soprano to ever grace the operatic stage. To compare Sutherland's voice to her is to state that Sutherland's soprano is not only of the highest order in terms of transcendental beauty, but also of amazing power and size. Yes, La Stupenda could have  sung Seglinda, and she could have sung Turandot on stage. She was trained for that as early as 1950. And because of this coaching as a Wagnerian in her earliest days  and her later transformation into a bel canto specialist(about 1954, thanks to her husband) she's became the rarest of creatures - the only true dramatic coloratura of this century. THAT's the reason so many people consider her &quot;The Voice of the Century&quot;. <br />As a true opera buff who admire many great singers of the past and present. I say that the Sutherland/Pavarotti/Caballe Turandot is the best recorded Turandot I've heard. That is not to say there are not better ones out there. I've just not heard them. But I have heard all the ones that are mention at this site. The Sutherland/Pavarotti/Caballe, the Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto, the Nilsson/Bjoeling/Tebaldi, the Nilsson/Corelli/Viscnjevskaja, and I also have a VHS Turandot with Udovick/Corelli/Mattioli(I bought this for Corelli alone, but discovered that Udovick was a sterling Turandot), and the Met's VHS with Eva Marton and Placido Domingo. <BR>All of these interpretations are valid and excellent. But if I had to make a choice, it would be easy. I much prefer this one - Sutherland/Pavarotti/Caballe.<br />I say this because of a lot of factors. I adore Puccini's Turandot. It is my favorite opera. Although the singing is very  important, opera is not all about voice. There is a conductor involved, an orchestra, an engineering team, a chorus, and dozens of other factors that can make or break a great performance. The Sutherland/Pavarotti/Caballe performance is the only one that has it all.<BR>The first thing I notice about this Turandot is  the dramatic chords that opens the first act. It is spine tinkling in it vividness. The sound coming from my speakers completely floored me - it is true state of the art. From that moment on, I was completely glued to my seat as Zubin Mehta brought out Puccini's awe-inspiring music beautifully through the fantastic LSO. The choral sound is far more rousing than any of its competitors. Then I melt at the haunting pianissimo high B of Caballe, singing of the smile that Calaf bestowed on her one day many years ago. All the while I was being penetrated by the glorious tenor of Luciano Pavarotti...this is just too beautiful.<br />However, I was not completely sure that this is the ultimate Turandot until I heard  what La Stupenda can do...First, that monstrously huge high C that she attacked in the middle of &quot;In Questa Reggia&quot;. Second, the ease and dynamics that she toke with the lines of Turandot's terrifying high tessitura. But it was her icy outcry of &quot;Straniero...Ascolta!&quot; that did it for me. The sheer weight of Sutherland's stupendous instrument and the force with which she attacked that awesome exclamation brought chills all over my body. From that moment on, I knew I've finally found my ideal Turandot. <br />I can go on and on about the countless highlights of this beauty, but I will not. This review is getting too long already. You can read the numerous other positive reviews by other fans if you want a scene by scene breakdown. But suffice it to say, I have listened to this interpretation of Puccini's masterpiece hundreds of times - sometimes everyday - before I was finally certain that it was not only my favorite Turandot, but my favorite operatic recording.

Suddenly, we see the aftermath of nuclear destruction. The voice of Sarah Connor tells us about the nuclear war that happened on August 29, 1997. Three billion human lives were taken. Those that survived this Judgement Day had to face another war, The War of the Machines.<br />  Sarah Connor did have a son, John Connor. In the future, John is a grown man and the leader during the War of the Machines.  The SkyNet Computer System sent out Terminators to go back to 1984 to try to omit John Connor as they were after Sarah Connor before her son was created and born.<br />It is now in the future, the year 1995. A surge of electricity and a black hole appears at a diesel truck stop. A naked, muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is transported through. It is the Terminator again. He walks into The Corral truck stop diner and gets looked at for his nakedness. He asks a biker (Robert Winley) for his clothes, boots and a motorcycle. The Terminator gets a cigar burnt into his chest. This starts a fight.  The Terminator gets &#34;bad to the bone&#34;.<br />  At the Santa Fe bridge, another naked man (Robert Patrick) is transported. He is a T-100. He kills the police officer (Tom McDonald) and takes his clothes and car.<br />  Both Terminators are after John Connor (Edward Furlong), who is now 10 years old and living in a foster home.<br />  Sarah Connor is in a mental hospital for schizophrenia. Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) put her in there. They are forcing her to be medicated. She is making herself stronger because she wants out of there to see and raise her son.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Danny Cooksey, Jim Palmer,  William Wisher Jr, Joe Morton, S.

0876855575|5.0|This book is simpley written, which is it's beauty. It's rare that you can come across a book written with so much feeling. This book revolves around alcoholism, violence, and carries a tone of never being able to overcome insurmmountable odds. Though I don't idolize Bukowski, I have to give him credit for being able to write a compelling novel. I  heavily recommend Post Office, Factotum, and Women as well.

0385509456|2.0|To call &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; a light read would be according it a heft it does not merit.  It's as lean as Twiggy, as thin as Oliver Twist's gruel, and as satisfying as a single McDonald's hash brown.  It's a good idea for a story -- a bright but autistic English teenage boy turns detective when his neighbor's dog is brutally murdered -- but the novelty wears off quickly and the story is, at best, perfunctory.  In fact, the promised &quot;detective story&quot; is resolved less than half-way through the book when the culprit abruptly confesses in one of the most anticlimactic murderer-revelations in the history of mysteries.  Hercule Poirot must be turning over in his fictional grave.  <br />The autistic narrator and protagonist of the book, 15-year-old Christopher Boone, has the deductive skills of Sherlock Holmes and the social skills of Raymond &quot;Rain Man&quot; Babbitt.  His obsession with logic makes Mr. Spock look like Dr. McCoy.  He -- literally -- takes everything literally and, in doing so, presents a distinctive literary voice, incapable and disdainful of all metaphor.  The book's value lies in the uniqueness of that voice, which, for a short while, is compelling.  Then, about the time the murderer up and confesses, it deteriorates into gimmick as the story takes an unexpected (and banal) turn into Soap Operaville, where Christopher's stock-figure parents and their marriage become the central characters.  The book is not without its minor pleasures, though, especially a long set-piece in which Christopher attempts to ride a bus and take the subway by himself and to find an address in London to which he's never been before.  I will never look at public transportation quite the same way again.  But the book is in no sense a novel, no matter what it says on the cover.  It's at best a good and quirky short story puffed up and out into book form.
B00005U122|5.0|I attended this concert at Darien Lake, New York. The dark skies threatened to open up and pour on the thousands of fans assembled at this outdoor venue. Moments before Roger and his band took the stage, the Sun broke thru the clouds, a Rainbow appeared and a night of magic was upon us. The surround sound was awesome and this DVD brings you all the sights and sounds of this excellent show right into your living room. I thought it was much better musically than The Pink Floyd show I saw in Toronto a few years before that. In that, I mean the mixture of songs from past P. F. albums. Floyd had the better stage show however. I bought this DVD a few months back and have played it 20 or more times. I recently purchased Roger Waters \\"The Wall\\" Live in Berlin. This DVD is also worth picking up if you are a serious Floyd fan. I only have about 10 concerts on DVD but I will say that \\"In The Flesh\\" is the best DVD I own. So Ya thought Ya might like to go to the show. If you missed this tour, buy this DVD. You won't be sorry !!
B00005221M|5.0|I don't know what some of you reviewers are complaining about.  This is a great movie, even on DVD.  the extra last bit at the end is fabulous.  Having seen both versions (on vhs and dvd) I would recommend both to viewers.
B00005O3VC|1.0|whiny voices and annoying intonation; why do they talk like that? and the whole thing is way too silly, the jokes are too unpredictable, there's no plot, just a collection of little low budget sketches that are immensely pointless. I really don't get it, why is this movie so popular? It is definintely not for everyone.<br />Doctor strangelove and young frankenstein are comedy movies that deserve their reputation and status, as for this one, it really pales in comparison and it seems so amateurish and jovenile. Kids in a highschool could've come up with something better.
B00009TB5G|5.0|.... <br />OK, I have given this film 5 stars. Why? Is it the best film ever? Probably not. Is it flawed? There are a few flaws here and there (as in every film - look at the number of flubs in Jurassic Park...) but they do not really distract from the whole experience. I have given this flick 5 stars because I was thoroughly thrilled by it, from the riveting beginning to the cliffhanging end. Loosen up, people! After all, it is only an interpretation of a fantasy novel. There is nothing sacred to Tolkien's texts, it is only a fantasy. And a very good one at that. I have read it many, many times in a couple of languages. I am sure this qualifies me as a geek, but I still think that Peter Jackson and his crew have done a more than commendable job, to put it mildly. Especially the second tome is a nightmare to adapt into a screenplay and a watchable movie. This movie is more than watchable, it is an action packed fantasy that is simply a marvel to behold. The production is so richly detailed that there is always something new to see. <br />Sure, there are deviations from the original story, but all in all I think Peter Jackson c.s. have done their utmost to respect the spirit and feel of Tolkien's works. I will certainly buy both the theatrical and the extended edition, and I have high hopes for a super-duper edition where every film lasts six hours or more.<br />Well done, you wizards in New Zealand! Should you ever come across these humble lines: It has been a joy so far, and I am looking forward to the next and, sadly, last film.<br />Personal note to Mr. Peter Jackson: If anybody can do 'The Hobbit', it is you. Please think about it.<br />Cheers!
0553269631|4.0|In the 307 pages of this story there is not a single ray of hope or happiness, not one morsel of humor, but only the most extreme isolation and despair. So, why read it? Because it's a superb example of technical mastery of the writer's craft, and a penetrating study of the human condition a la Dostoevsky.<BR>Labelling The Heart is a Lonely Hunter \\"a Southern novel\\" may be accurate by virtue of its setting, but it is certainly not adequate. The story could have been set almost anywhere, with minor textual changes, and it would have been just as applicable and powerful. Furthermore, the story has historical merit, delving into youthful perceptions of pre-WWII geo-politics, domestic politics, and exploring a few sexual subjects that were taboo in the author's day.<BR>Don't read this story to find direct answers for the human condition. This is not a book of \\"what to do,\\" but rather of \\"what not to do.\\" Also, this is not an appropriate story for younger readers or those presently on a regimen of prescription antidepressants.<BR>Guardedly recommended.
0385504209|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\"<br />by Dan Brown<br />Seldom am I influenced by the masses, but I couldn't help stumbling upon this novel all over the high school where I teach.  Many of my fellow teachers had a copy as well as a large portion of the student body.  My interest was peaked.  I had to join the informal book club.  The story revolved around a Harvard symbologist named Robert Langdon.  While in Paris giving lectures, Langdon was inadvertently drawn inside a mystery of biblical proportions.  Langdon immediately hooked up with a female French cryptologist and soon embarked on a quest to decipher clues/secrets protected by an ancient sect called the Priory of Sion (a faction boasting past members such as Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo and of course Leonardo Da Vinci).  The pacing, story and plot were phenomenal.<br />What are your images of the Holy Grail?  What do you think about the possibility of Jesus fathering a child to Mary Magdalene?  What if this mythical child could have formed a continual bloodline from God, to Old Testament descendants (Moses, Noah, etc.), to Jesus, to members of society currently alive on Earth today?  What if a female was meant to lead the first church in order to pave the way for Christianity?  What if Da Vinci's painting of the \\"Last Supper\\" depicted a mystery dinner guest in addition to the disciples?  Sacrilegious?  Sure, this book will probably anger strict Catholics and members of the sect Opus Dei, but overall, the script doesn't trespass into Christian deity on too grand of a scale.  Perhaps the most intriguing aspects of this novel dealt with its amazing (and interesting) depiction of mathematics (Fibonacci Sequence), art (Da Vinci) and cryptology.  I loved the mathematics especially!  Another strength of the novel is its use of real organizations and factual descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and rituals.  I guarantee that you will visit the Internet to check out Da Vinci's artwork (especially the \\"Mona Lisa\\" and the \\"Last Supper\\") upon reading pertinent plot points in this novel.<br />Dan Brown is one of the most intelligent storytellers of this current era.  Too bad he doesn't know how to develop characters real well.  I never got to know what made Robert Langdon tick.  If Mr. Brown improves this aspect of his storytelling, he will become the next must-read author for years to come.  Look for the character of Robert Langdon to hit the multiplexes soon.<br />My Grade  Ana Lisa\\" and the \\"Last Supper\\") upon reading pertinent plot points in this novel.  <br />Dan Brown is one of the most intelligent storytellers of this current era.

0151008116|5.0|Several reviewers have stated that Life of Pi was slow and a hard read.  This is sad testament to the decay of American literacy and the onset of a culture wide case of ADD.  Life of Pi is a beautifully written fable that pulls the reader into a wonderful world where a boy and a tiger can develop a symbiotic relationship and possibly a mutual admiration.  <br />The young man is thrown overboard in a storm from a freighter taking him and his family to Canada with (almost) a zoo full of exotic animals.  Armed only with his wits and a survival kit stowed under a seat Pi manages to eek out an existence for himself and the male Bengal Tiger stranded on board with him.<br />The pace is slow, but in the way that Hitchcock movies started slowly.  Palpable fear and suspense seep off of every page.  Readers take delight in the small event of Pi catching his first fish and shudder with dread after the secret of the island he is washed ashore on is revealed.  The fact that the story is told in flashback shows that the young man survives, but it is the process of living and belief that deliverance will come that are the compelling reasons to keep turning these pages.<br />Life of Pi was easily the smartest and most life affirming book I've read in a number of years and I plan on sharing it with as many folks as I can.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy today.
0688163173|4.0|\\"Shutter Island\\"<br />by Dennis Lehane<br />During the summer of 1954, two US marshals traveled to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island to explore the whereabouts of a missing mental patient (or maybe to investigate whether the hospital was performing illegal surgery on its residents).  One of the marshals (Teddy Daniels) may have had yet one other hidden reason for visiting the asylum.  This thriller is an unforgettable page-turner.  Ultimately, the plot will unfold, secrets will be exposed and the reader will either be pleasantly surprised or overtly shocked by the final outcome.  Will Teddy ever escape from the island?  Will atrocities and/or illegal experiments at Ashecliffe Hospital be revealed?  What happened to the missing mental patient?  If you want the answers, you will have to read this book for yourself.  An extremely talented author, Dennis Lehane has all the right stuff when it comes to crafting the perfect thriller.  Apparently, Lehane's previous novel \\"Mystic River\\" has already been made into a hit movie.<br />My Grade:  A
B00005JLEU|5.0|Visually distinctive . . . an engaging story, 'Spirited Away' is a great choice for adventurous kids and their parents. Hayao Miyazaki's best release to date.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I'd heard various Moby songs before, but it wasn't until I heard his album &quot;Play&quot; that I became a well and truly devoted Moby fan. His music is inspiring, intelligent, thought provoking, and revolutionary. It could almost be classified as art. Bodyrock, Porcelain, South Side and Everloving are my favourites, but the other tracks are also excellent. I would definately recommend this cd to anyone.
1563898586|5.0|If the same \\"brilliant\\" minds that took Alan Moore's \\"League\\" and re-wrote it for the movies were also given The Bible to adapt, I'm sure we could look forward to that scene where Jesus & Hercules single-handedly take on the evil forces of The Mummy's legions.<br />In New York.<br />The film has taken the barest bones of the original conceit (taking now public domain characters from 19th century literature and have them form a proto-Impossible Missions Force) and thoroughly stripped all that was fresh, intelligent, witty, subtle or interesting about it. Unnecessary characters (Dorian Grey, Tom Sawyer?!?) are added. The whole second half of the plot is dropped. Quartermain, (Sean Connery's character in the film) is made the group leader, and Mina Harker, a mysterious character who's vampyrism is only vaguely hinted at in the book, has gone altogether, ermmm, batty.<br />By contrast, this, the comic version, is by far more literate. And the art, particularly the subtle dark coloring, is absolutely first rate.<br />The good news is that the film is tanking and \\"The Watchmen\\", regarded by most as Moore's magnum opus, shall never be subjugated to such a fate.
0312305060|5.0|I read this book and I haven't even seen the movie yet.  The Hours depicts the lives of three women living in different time periods (Virginia Woolf, Laura Brown, and Clarrisa).  Their lives are interwoven by the use of Cummingham's great prose.  The Hours paints a striking portrait of sexual ambiguity and depression, all traits that the three main characters share.  I read this novel in one day and highly recommend it.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Summary:<BR>Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the son of the former Irish gang leader in New York, The Priest (Liam Neeson). The movie opens with the gang battle in which The Priest dies, killed by the American gang leader, William Cutting, a.k.a 'Bill 'The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis); at the time of the fight Amsterdam is a boy, is unable to fight or help, and witnesses his father's fall.<br />Years later, Amsterdam, now a man, is let out of state custody and returns to his neighborhood that is now controlled almost exclusively by The Butcher. His people, The Irish immigrants that live in the five corners area (his childhood neighborhood), are looked down upon by the so-called American 'natives', who aren't really natives, but their ignorance isn't the point.  Amsterdam joins a small Irish gang of thieves who pay a percentage of their take to The Butcher.  Eventually Amsterdam comes under the wing of The Butcher and is taught how to be a better fighter and how to lead a group of men.  At the same time, Amsterdam finds a romantic interest, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz).<br />Despite playing the role of one of The Butcher's supporters, secretly Amsterdam is working up the courage to avenge his father.  His first attempt is foiled and he is nearly killed, but The Butcher lets him live with a brand to show the world his failure.  Nursed back to health by Jenny, he eventually brings the remnants of his father's gang back together and with their support challenges The Butcher to a final showdown.  Meanwhile, while of the commotion of the gangs is taking place, America is caught up in the Civil War.  On the day of the final showdown, riots break loose in New York and it takes the U.S. Army to put it down, killing thousands in the process and ruining the final showdown, except for one fight - the fight between The Butcher and Amsterdam.<br />My Comments:<BR>This is a very long movie.  Did I say this was long?  With some movies, the length seems to be unimportant because it has so much to cover.  It was important in this one because it was so slow at times.  Nevertheless, I did like the movie.<br />The story itself is pretty interesting.  It tends to jump around a bit and could have used some additional editing and perhaps some re-writing to make it move faster.  Another problem with the story is that most of the peripheral characters' stories come to abrupt and rather unsatisfying ends.  For instance, on the day of the final showdown almost all of the characters that actually were notably involved in the gangs were killed by soldiers.  It worked to end their stories and make it so we didn't have to wonder what happened to them, but some of the gang members attacked the soldiers in sheer idiotic rage - very unconvincing.  The story had its good points and its bad points, but overall wasn't too bad.<br />As for the acting, Daniel Day-Lewis was incredible.  He created a remarkably memorable character that will be hard to forget.  Leonardo DiCaprio was also good, but this just didn't seem to be the kind of role that was meant for him.  I could have better envisioned Brad Pitt in that role.  DiCaprio just seems too small, too weak to be a skilled fighter and gang leader, so it was kind of unconvincing, but he did do a decent job.  Cameron Diaz was funny.  She was actually much better than I thought she would be, but her accent came and went and she seemed to be having a hard time being sentimental.  It was kind of a new role for her, which I'm sure will be good for her career, but if she really wants to move in the direction of drama she still has a way to go.  There were a number of peripheral characters that were also pretty good, but there were so many of them that I don't know that they are worth listing.  <br />Overall, the movie was entertaining, but far from perfect.  I should also mention that the set design was remarkable and the attempts at re-creating a bygone era were very convincing.  Most of the acting was pretty good,with few exceptions.  The big problem here is a long and drawn out story that, despite its length, doesn't convincingly bring all of the character lines to a close.  Overall, I think I would recommend this movie, but keep in mind that it is very, very long and very slow at times.  Have something else to do while you watch it or you'll likely lose interest.
B00006879E|4.0|I saw Maroon 5 live on tour with John Mayer.  They've got a good, solid, rock sound, and their lyrics are great.  They sound excellent live.  My only complaint would be that the lead tends to scream too much.
0790729652|5.0|Tim Burton did an excellent job on turning \\"Batman\\" into a dark somewhat troubled guy. Im sure everyone has seen this movie by now, i seen it on tv the other day and forgotten how good it was. In all the sequels i don't think no one pulled off Batman better than \\"Micheal Keaton\\" he was the perfect batman. And the main thing that makes Batman such a classic, and such a great film is the living legend \\"Jack Nickelson\\" as the joker. With such great acting and storytelling, this movie had know where to go but in the classic catagory.
0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down is one of my favorite movies--I've seen it a number of times--but I felt that I was doing it an injustice without having read the book.  The book is obviously more accurate and offers more information. <br />While reading the book, I was surprised to find myself thinking how poorly the mission seemed to have been planned (for contingencies, anyway) and the lack of discipline on the part of some of the Rangers. I was also surprised that I thought how cowardly some of the Rangers seemed to be. I always scoff when somebody says that the Rangers--or even Airborne--are the Army's elite soldiers (after all, my dad was a Special Forces Green Beret and the Army also has the Delta Force), but I was shocked at some of the actions (or inactions) of some of the Rangers. (The Rangers, Special Forces, and Delta all are unique in their own right and serve vastly different functions within the Army; I'm not saying that the Rangers are not an elite unit. However, I do not consider them the Army's preeminent elite unit.) Then again, war is a terrible thing and since I've never been in a firefight, I suspect that at times soldiers--even those as disciplined as Rangers--are apt to do things which at times may seem cowardly or irrational. I'm in no position to judge. My thoughts do not diminish, however, the immense courage that these men--Delta Force, Rangers, Navy SEALs, Night Stalkers, and Air Force PJs and CCTs--showed in the heat of battle. Men who serve our country with distinction and honor. I salute them and offer my thanks. With all that said, I came away with an even deeper appreciation and respect (which was already quite high) for the Rangers than I had prior to reading the book. The book also reinforced my already high esteem of Delta Force operators.<br />Mark Bowden seems to have painstakingly put together as accurate a depiction of battle as you will ever read.  The accounts in the book come first hand from recorded audio and video from the battle as wellas numerous interviews of the combatants--US soldiers and Somalians. The book offers a surprisingly human aspect to war and shows that brave men do not necessarily have to be fearless. This book is required reading at the US Army Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas and has received several honors from the US Marine Corps.  Many within the Pentagon and US military have praised Bowden for writing the book. <br />Mark Bowden wrote a terrific book and I'm glad that I read it. Do yourself a favor and read it too.

B000099T2L|1.0|While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store. Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.<br />  Beyonce Knowles is a very talented woman: She is a good actress (which we are to see more of this summer), she has a great voice if put to good use, she writes catchy radio-ready songs and can produce like no one else. Maybe this is why the last Destiny's Child album, \\"Survivor\\", was such a success, Beyonce fully controlled the writing and producing of each track. On \\"Dangerously In Love\\", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands. The best track on this record is clearly \\"Crazy in Love\\", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment. \\"Signs\\", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative. But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be \\"Gift From Virgo\\"; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it. The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune. It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.<BR>  The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is \\"Dangerously In Love\\", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica. <br />The only songs that are worth bearing at all are \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Yes\\", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in thefuture. But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.<br />  If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident. It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own. Let's just hope they lose each other's numbers.
B00003CX97|5.0|Directed by David Lean, this film focuses on an attempt by a team led by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) to destroy a strategically important bridge over the Kwai river in Burma in 1943, a bridge built by British prisoners during World War II. An epic in every possible sense, the inhumanities of the Japanese are probably underplayed somewhat so that we can focus on two essential conflicts of will, one between Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and the other between Warden and Shears (William Holden) who is forced to join Warden's team and thereby avoid a court martial for impersonating a U.S. naval officer. It should also be noted that Nicholson struggles with a conflict between his obligations as a British officer (i.e. to resist his enemy in any and every possible way) and his determination to demonstrate British superiority over the Japanese captors. Colonel Saito has his own conflicts, notably between imposing his will on Nicholson and the British troops and getting the bridge built. At the heart of this magnificent film are several moral dilemmas which help to explain why we become so emotionally involved with its narrative.<br />One of the many pleasures of seeing this film (especially in its DVD format) is the juxtaposition of lush tropical settings with the raw emotions of those who are building the bridge and those who are determined to destroy it. I am also struck by how carefully Lean develops the semi-adversarial relationships between Nicholson and Saito and between Warden and Shears. Although &quot;Madness... Madness&quot; is frequently quoted as an evaluation of those relationships, I disagree.  Saito has been ordered to built the bridge, Nicholson agrees to accomplish that task but on his terms, Warden has been assigned to destroy it, and Shears (who considers all this \\"madness\\" but plays a key role in achieving that objective) lacks the circumspection which Lean enables us to have. Of course, war itself is madness...and yet there is (or at least can be) a redeeming if misguided integrity in how adversaries conduct themselves amidst that madness.<br />The excellence of this film was acknowledged by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, receiving in 1957 seven Oscars for  Best Actor (Guinness). Best Adapted Screenplay (Pierre Boulle), Best Cinematography (Jack Hildyard), Best Director (Lean), Best Editing (Peter Taylor), and Best Score (Malcolm Arnold). Years later, it was ranked #13 among \\"America's Greatest Movies\\" by the American Film Institute. I consider it ludicrous that Gone With the Wind (#4) is ranked higher than The Bridge on the River Kwai by the AFI. For those with a sensitive palate, the former is junk food whereas the latter is gourmet cuisine.f is madness...and yet there is (or at least can be) a redeeming if misguided integrity in how adversaries conduct themselves amidst that madness.<br />The excellence of this film was acknowledged by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, receiving in 1957 seven Oscars for  Best Actor (Guinness).

B00009L1TA|5.0|I read the other reviews and really don't understand them at all. This is one of the very best movies I have seen in quite some time.  This is a heads up movie, you have to pay attention, especially to the characters.  It is a bit far fetched but its a movie. I truly enjoyed it, with all the true to life war movies that are out there, its nice to see one a little different.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Boldly, director Wilder begins this film with a shot of a man floating in a swimming pool. Who is he? What's his story? We learn from a voiceover that the dead man is Joe Gillis (played by William Holden) who provides the voiceover and eventually explains what happened. The focus of this film is on Joe's relationship with Norma Desmond, long ago one of Hollywood's greatest stars. (Comparable with Gloria Swanson, for example.) Billy Wilder suggests that she (played by Swanson) is concluding a personal sunset, forgotten or assumed to be dead by a once-adoring public . Many Sunset Boulevard as an indictment of an industry in which Wilder enjoyed such great success. My own opinion is that he and his three co-screenwriters tell a story which features characters which are hardly unique to \\"Hollywood.\\" For example, Norma Desmond could also be a wealthy widow and grand damme living in Westchester County when not ensconced at her summer home in the Hamptons. Her disruption at the studio in Hollywood could just as easily have occurred at a corporate headquarters in Manhattan. As for Joe Gillis, parasitic creatures such as he can be found in almost every segment of our society. Wilder and his associates wrote about a world they understood so well, one in which illusions, delusions, and realities are so often considered to be essentially the same. In my opinion, Wilder includes a character such as Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) to set her balance and decency in sharp contrast with Desmond's psychoses and Gillis' amorality.<br />Indeed, there are so many stunning contrasts throughout this film. Note how brilliantly Wilder uses scenes set at night, indoors, or in sunlight to develop several of his themes. Understandably, Gillis feels smothered and confined when in Desmond's mansion. The tone of his voice and his body language are quite different when visiting friends at a studio (without Desmond) or when he mingling with Artie Webb (Jack Webb) and others at a party. Other key contrasts involve Max Von Mayerling (Eric von Stroheim), Desmond's former director and husband who now serves as her chauffeur and all-purpose house servant. He alone provides the  loyalty and devotion she once attracted from so many others. Even those who occasionally play cards with her (Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner playing themselves) indicate no interest in her whatsoever, much less affection.<br />This is probably about as close to being a \\"noir\\" film as Wilder ever created. Frankly, I still wonder what he thinks of Norma Desmond. Perhaps some deference which DeMille indicates when she descends upon him at the studio. Perhaps some pity which Gillis (albeit briefly and rarely) suggests. Perhaps both. For me, the most memorable scene occurs near the end when she slowly descends the winding stairway, her addled mind locked in on circumstances which occurred decades ago. Yes, I feel some sympathy for her...but, as an indication of Holden's skills as an actor, none for Gillis. Unlike Sefton in Stalag 17 (another film directed by Wilder), he has no redeeming virtues and deserved his fate...his own sunset. It's a wrap!rasts involve Max Von Mayerling (Eric von Stroheim), Desmond's former director and husband who now serves as her chauffeur and all-purpose house servant.

B00008OWZC|5.0|Every Led Zep fan should own this cd.  The guitars are electrifying and will blow your mind away. The drum solos are insane! My personal favorite on this cd is \\"Since I've been loving you\\".  I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys heavy metal, and of course classic rock.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Yes, the comparison to Animal House is fair in some ways.  The cast of both movies had substantial support from Saturday Night Live (SNL) crew, and of course the Fraternity vs. Dean plot line was good, but that's where the similarity ended. While Animal House was know for it's college-mentality plot, and what later became the definite standard of college humor movies to come (spoofed/carried by the Nerds series, as well as other comedies like Big Man on Campus, etc...), it never did have the \\"clean, production look\\" of a movie of it's caliber.<br />Old School has a more grown-up view of fraternity life, and in all honesty is closer to reality than Animal House EVER was.  What Animal House (and Dartmouth College) did to discredit Greek organizations, Old School seems to have portrayed  in a positive light.  Granted, Old School gets a bit off color in subject matter at times, but nothing that would seem out of character or included for shock value as so many B movies seem to do.  This focus on gut-splitting humor (verses random, gratuitous nudity) is typified by the difference between the R rated and Unrated versions.  As other reviewers mentioned, the R version (which I saw in theaters...twice) is not much different from the unrated DVD... the focus here was humor, nothing more.<br />The physical humor, decent plot, great character development, and cameos by Snoop Dog, Warren G, a host of SNL staff, as well as other comedy-focused actors leaves this movie chalk-full of talent and obviously had some serious financial support... and it shows.<br />Will Ferrell shows again why he is one of the funniest actors in Hollywood, while no one in the movie missed a beat whether it be a soft delivery, missed facial gesture, or even milking the plot for everything it had.  It was a bit long (spasm-laden stomach muscles will do that though), and I tried to think if a few scenes could have been \\"possible cuts\\", but the character development and humor involved in EVERY single scenewas just too good to miss.<br />Seeing this movie in theaters left me feeling I paid a fair price, which is unusual considering the vast majority of so-so movies that we've been force-fed by Holly Wood the past few years.  Borrowing this DVD from a friend (and seeing it 3 times in 2 weeks :)) has left me convinced I'll be adding this to my DVD collection shortly.  As a truely underrated comedy (which is unusual considering the ... comdies that are industry-standard), this is a definite must-have.
0385509456|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it was just okay.  Frankly, it's not really a book for adults--it's a kids book, and the author is a children's book author.  It's being marketed as an adult book, and I'm not quite sure why.  Like most literature for children, it's fun to read, but it's only skin deep.  You will forget this story as soon as you close the covers.  So if you want to spend your money on a book that you will enjoy for about two hours and then forget about, then go for it.  For me, however, I wish I would have waited for the paperback.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums of all time. Every single song is filled with awesome guitars, vocals, and lyrics. The first time I listened to this, it quite simply blew me away. I wasn't expecting this from a band I had previously never heard of before. These guys should be hangin' with Led Zeppelin and the rolling stones, not forgotten. Tracks &quot;lights out&quot;, &quot;rock bottom&quot;, &quot;love to love&quot;, and &quot;shoot shoot&quot; along with all the rest of them will rock your socks off. You'll be dancing &quot;out in the street.&quot; STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT ROCKS!
B0000024IE|5.0|Considered by the conservative press in 90' as just plain prejudiced, I don't seem to mind at all.  In fact, there are so many deep-rooted social problems and distinctions to be addressed in this country, that I find it difficult that anyone criticizes their manner of expression on Fear Of A Black Planet--keyword, it's just an expression.  As with PE's previous albums, Chuck D represents the group as chief negotiator while Flavor Flav adds a cynical, humorous \\"flavor\\" to the group.  Other associate bomb squad members, Terminator X and so on are the functional experts, taking on the responsibilities of mixing, scratching, sampling, and editing.  Granted, there are dozens of similar hip-hop posses that fit into political rap, but PE doesn't let itself be included anyone broad category.  Instead, they diversified their sound, creating rap, funk and, weirdly enough, just a great pop sound--1990 style that is.  There's also enough sirens and samples to keep the most greedy of the hip-hop enthusiasts occupied.  Be careful though: it's easy to be engulfed in the imagery of the composition, sometimes considering the revolutionary tactics that PE suggests.  But, then I move on to another artifact (It Takes A Nation...or Son Of A Bush) and start all over again...

B00002SSKI|5.0|Yeah, so what if Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Rita Wilson, and Melanie Griffith didn't put out stellar performances. They're in the movie for a total of maybe 15-20 minutes. Instead, focus on the brilliant performances of Gaby Hoffmann, Thora Birch, Ashleigh Aston Moore, and, in particular, Christina Ricci. This movie is about four girls and a summer that changed them, but still kept tight the bond that they had, resulting in them coming back after all those years to aide their friend at a turning point in her life. So what if it's a \\"rip-off\\" of \\"Stand By Me\\". I say, get over it, and enjoy this great movie for females (and males) of all ages.

6303168507|5.0|[[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)]]I saw this movie for the first time along with a group of seven other people, in a completely full theater.  When the curtain went down and the lights came on, everyone got up and moved to the door, but no one said a word.  Not one.  It was dead quiet all the way out to the street.  I've never experienced anything like that.<br /><br />I was raised knowing all about the six million we lost in the Holocaust, not to mention the five or six million others who died in the camps, but I didn't really get it until Spielberg silenced me and everyone else in the room.  How did he do it?<br /><br />First of all, he chose the right protagonist.  Oskar Schindler, the savior of a thousand Jews, was anything but an angel - he toadied up to those in power unashamedly, paid bribes with money he didn't have, took advantage of the unfortunate for his own ends, cheated endlessly on his wife, and kept his eye on his bottom line to the exclusion of everything else.  He was flawed, vulnerable and human, like you and me, and through his reaction to what he sees we can feel the indescribable horror as we could not through the reactions of a saint.  There's a scene in this movie where Schindler, out for a horseback ride with one of his girlfriends, happens upon a mountain of corpses being burned.  A saint might look sad or angry at such a scene - Liam Neeson's expression is that of a man falling off a cliff he didn't know was there.  Faced with such carnage, that's probably how I'd look, too.<br /><br />Spielberg's other smart move was filming \\"Schindler's List\\" in black and white.  Siskel and Ebert have pointed out, rightly, that black and white makes images appear somehow eternal, like historical documents rather than mere pictures.  That's certainly true here, but it works on many levels.  Sometimes the black and white photography has a matte finish and takes on the character of news photography, showing how banal (and therefore how terrifying) an image is, such as those times when Ralph Fiennes Commandant Goeth shoots a few passing prisoners for breakfast.  On the other hand, \\"Schindler's List\\" contains a great many images that look like they were etched on mirrors, such as the famous shot of a little boy hiding from the Nazis at the bottom of a latrine.  At those moments, even when (as one character says) \\"all around lies the gulf,\\" the pictures soak up a truly heavenly light, as though Someone were watching.<br /><br />The performers involved certainly behave as though Someone were watching, and they turn in the work of their lives, from the stars to the bit players.  Neeson has just the right sort of big, craggy face that can show decadence one minute and agony the next, and he's got the talent to run the whole gamut in all the right places.  Fiennes, in his first major role, resembles nothing so much as a sort of human hog, but a cunning and crazed one - he seems able to sweat on cue.  Ben Kingsley as Schindler's factory manager, with almost no change in his facial expression, makes us see how he moves from suspicion to hope to love for this strange animal, his boss.  And besides these monumental performances, there's the black marketeer who finagles his customers with one breath and loves his wife with the next; the engineer who sacrifices her life to the fact that concrete needs to be poured with care; the old hinge-maker who waits on his knees for a miracle involving a jammed gun; the pretty young woman who informs Schindler that he's running a haven rather than a factory; the kindly but finally gutless industrialist, and a many dozen others, all unforgettable.<br /><br />And then there's Spielberg's damping down his usual sentimentality, his choice of Yiddish music for the soundtrack, his placement of the camera at a quiet and unobtrusive angle for the worst of evils - I found all of this pretty nearly perfect, but there were those who complained about the movie's historical inaccuracy.  In one scene, much noted for its supposed softening of the facts, Schindler's female \\"employees\\" find themselves in a big room with shower heads in the ceiling and actually get a shower instead of a flood of poison gas.  It's true that most prisoners were not so fortunate, and that such scenes may play into the hands of the filth who claim that there was no cyanide in the camps, but I can't see that as an argument against this movie.  If nothing else, the looks of tension on the women's faces before the water comes down is more than enough to tell us what they expect to get.<br /><br />After all, Spielberg is not a documentarian, he's a storyteller; this story could not have had a better servant.  The meaning of the Holocaust is as plain as plain here, particularly at the end when Schindler realizes that he could have saved a few more human beings if he had just thought to sell his car or his gold Nazi pin.  He crumples weeping to his knees, only to be lifted up by the men and women he has saved.<br /><br />A little later we learn that the descendants of Schindler's Jews living in Israel outnumber the entire current Jewish population of Poland.  That silences all criticism, as the movie audience already knew.  Hence the quiet after the final credits.<br /><br />Benshlomo says nothing.pposed softening of the facts, Schindler's female \\"employees\\" find themselves in a big room with shower heads in the ceiling and actually get a shower instead of a flood of poison gas.

Beyonces voice is very strong. and Jay Z lends good vocals as well, though to be honest, I havent actually listened to what he says, but his voice matches the flow of the song very well. <br />\\"Naughty Girl\\"-- This song has a slight Arabic sound to it and also a little bit of funk. It's highly sexual, which I like to hear because it shows that Beyonce is older and expressing herself as a woman. Her voice takes on a very sensual tone throughout the song. <br />\\"Baby Boy\\"-- This song features SEan Paul. I love his flow on it. Definitely another a sexual type of song. She sings \\"Hurt me so good baby\\" Definitely one for the clubs. <br />\\"Hip Hop Star\\"-- I personally didnt like this song too much.It sounded a little bit TOO out of place on the album. features big boi of outkast. <br />\\"Be With You\\"-- samples \\"Strawberry Letter 23\\" and \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\". This is a very beautiful love song. She sings \\"I'd rather be with you because I love the way you scream my name...\\" <br />\\"Me, Myself, and I\\"--Basically talkin about learning how to be your own best friend. Love the message and the beat is nice and laid back. <br />\\"Yes\\"-- Absolutely love this song. I think its one of those songs that most women can relate to at some point in life. She sings \\"I said yes we can be together, yes u can stay with me, but when i say no not tonight, u acting so ungrategully. the first time i said no, it's like i never said yes.\\" One of my favorites <br />\\"Signs\\"-- Missy is cool, but she must have lost some artistic insight along with that weight. Please tell me why she even needs to say anything on the song. She produced but that dont mean she needs to say something. The song would have been better off without her vocals on it. But other than that, the song has an interesting sound to it and makes an otherwise boring topic sound nice. <br />\\"Speechless\\"-- The best song on the album in my opinion. Her vocals are on point like never before. This song is from a woman who is very obviously in complete love and lust with a man. She sings \\"Going out my head, I think I'm losing all my mind. Drive me crazy, burning candles, making love all night...\\" Damn...its like \\"Crazy in Love\\" with better lyrics, sexier, and more sensual. And her vocal rifts at the end where she sings out \\"Yes\\" is like the orgasm after hours of passionate lovemaking. <br />\\"That's how you like it\\"-- features Jay Z. Sounds like a song her little sister, Solange would sing. Kinda corny, but then again cute in its own way. <br />\\"The Closer I Get to You\\"-- features the infamous luther vandross. The song is very beautiful and their voices flow together nicely. <br />\\"Dangerously in Love pt 2\\"--Basically just like the original but the beat is just slightly different. And I loved the song on the other album. IT was my favorite on the DC album and my secong fave on this one. <br />Even the Beyonce interlude is beautiful when she tells her lover that she \\"tried to paint you but the colors weren't beautiful enough\\". I'm gonna have to tell my man that real soon. lol <br />\\"Gift From Virgo\\"-- very beautiful song about she always wants to be with this man. if shes singing about jay-z then he's a very lucky guy. <br />\\"Daddy\\"-- a bonus hidden track. very sweet song from a very obvious daddys girl. i kinda wonder why she aint sing a song for her mom too, but hey maybe next album.
B00005QDW1|4.0|My first favorite ND song was &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; off their &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; cd. When this next cd came out, i was expecting the same effort. It wasn't quite there. Now don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic album, filled with energy from the band, and Gwen Stefani's emotion filled vocals, but it wasn't quite up to par with what they have done. I liked alot of the songs, but they seemed more of a 'poppy' sound than of the raw 'ska'ish sound that had been their trademark previously. <br />Recomended, but if you have to choose between &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and One of their previous albums, choose &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;
B00008RH3L|5.0|Forget 'Road to Perdition', THIS is the best mob-film since 'The Godfather'.  Miller's Crossing takes you into the heart of the Irish mob, and the plot twists are completely unpredictable.<br />The cinematography is beautiful, and the script-writing is amazing.  Watch it more than once!  This movie's got it all.
B0000057C5|5.0|This album is one of the most original and powerful CDs to come out in a long time. The catchy riffs, heartfelt vocals, and dancable keyboards all come together to create a memorable CD. Rammstein blend Early NIN techno sounding keyboards with industrial/metel style guitars reminiscent of KMFDM or Oomph! to create some of the most original music I have heard in a long time. Songs like Bestrafe Mich, Alter mann, and Spiel mit Mir are slow and brooding pieces building up to unforgetable chorus', while Teir, Sehnsucht, Eifersucht, and Du Hast are fast and heavy. This is probably the best Rammstein album, but the other ones are awesome too. All in all, I blows... new metel bands out of the water.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Disc 1 shows Led Zepellin in 1970 playing their fast and furious early hits, nearly note for note like their early records. At that date, they were indeed, like the folks in Spinal Tap, definitely \\"one of Englands loudest bands.\\" Music beloved by the teens and pre-teens of the time, or at least those who had never heard real blues or taken music lessons. Having said that, Disc 2 \\"goes to eleven.\\"  Or a solid 5 stars on this rating system. <br />Very interesting, complex material such as Kashimir, Achilles Last Stand, Going to California, and of course, Stairway to Heaven (which I think has aged surprisingly well), taken primarily from 1975 and 1979 shows on Disc 2 reveals an older, better, far more interesting band. As for the \\"somber\\" version of Whole Lot of Love from 1979, noted by another reviewer, it reveals a band that finally learned how play the deep blues in the soulful spirit of the Muddy Waters (Willie Dixon composed) song they ripped off without properly crediting in their early days. Technically, Page is a master throughout on 6, 12 string electrics, slide guitar and acoustic flatpicking; Plant show he learned how to sing, not just scream, as he gained experience and Bonham (though literally a dying man in the 1979 set) plays with a sophisticated musicality I never heard on the records. This second disc is truly thrilling material, and worth the cost of the two disc set.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|How well I remember when this movie was released in 1976: long lines at the box office, spontaneous cheers from the audience, bursts of applause at pivotal moments and a great all-around buzz about the movie. Sadly, the intervening years haven't been kind to \\"Network,\\" and it seems to have been relegated to the back burner in many people's minds. What a colossal mistake. This movie is one of the most perfect films made in the past fifty years and boasts several mesmerizing performances.<br />The top kudo's must go to Peter Finch as the neurotic, bombastic and brilliant news anchorman, Howard Beale. This is a performancre of the ages: rich, nuanced, mature and believable, an absolute acting tour de force. Finch richly deserved the posthumous Academy Award, which was gracefully accepted by his widow. One of the great lines in screen history has got to be, \\"I'm mad a hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!\\" When \\"Network\\" was first aired on TV in the late 70's, I still remember neighbors going to the window and actually screaming out this line in frantic unison.<br />Faye Dunaway also won an Oscar in her role as a frigid, catty and heartless witch of a woman whom Bill Holden vainly tries to tame. Robert Duvall delivers yet another outstanding performance. The script, dialogue and sets are all superb. The screenplay cackles with an intensity and spirit which are sorely lacking in today's films. But first and foremost is the performance of Peter Finch. It's one for the ages!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Two things came to my mind as I watched this two DVD set.<br />1.)  How incredibly awesome Led Zeppelin was<BR>2.)  How utterly derivative, sad, and even pathetic most of today's \\"rock stars\\" and \\"rock bands\\" (can you say \\"Creed?\\") are in comparison.  I hope some of them immediately throw away their instruments (assuming they know how to play) and start new careers after seeing how TRUE masters can lay it down.<br />There are so many reasons to buy this DVD set.  First off, it's an incredible bargain; you get over FIVE HOURS worth of performances and rare extras for about twenty bucks.  Other acts have charged five times as much for less than half the product.<br />Oh yeah, then there's the music and the performances.  Words can't do them justice.  The musicianship on display is simply incredible.  Their sense of composure and maturity is also worthy of note.  I'm quite impressed that Robert Plant was so self-aware (without being overly cocksure) and relaxed at such a young age.  Everybody in this band could play; I don't see how this band could have been composed of anyone else, and now understand why they broke up after Bonzo died.<br />I also appreciate the refreshing lack of \\"in your face\\" commercialism that Led Zeppelin embraced.  Sure, they flew in their own plane and partied it up, but they weren't like Kiss which is a band that was (and is) more about image and the lifetstyle than the music.  <br />Watching this band is like watching the evolution of rock and roll take place before your very eyes.  Led Zeppelin is obviously a VERY important band, certainly one of the five greatest bands in rock and roll history.  That they have chosen to release something like this is a real treat and should prove (again) once and for all their seminal place in music history.

0767903862|5.0|Bryson is my favorite travel writer, and this is my favorite of his books. It is hilarious, gives quantities of interesting information about Australia, and is much cleaner than his early books (the profanity and sexual jokes are kept to a minimum, though they're not completely absent). <br />Bryson's wit is as razor sharp as ever, identifying countless charming (and not so charming) idiosyncrasies in the Australian national personality and displaying them for our inspection. His research for this book was copious. He culls from it the most interesting details of Australian history and culture for his text. You will both learn and laugh. The description of his sleeping through a personal tour because of jet jag made me laugh until I cried. My dad read the book aloud, and we nearly laughed ourselves sick. This is a keeper.
B00005A46T|5.0|This cd will either make you jump for joy at the chance to hear a truly HEAVY metal album, or it will make you stick your fingers in your ears and run for your closest copy of the new Metallica album. <br />I am one of the former. I love innovative metal bands, and Slipknot is one of the best. Iowa is the very peak of everything you could imagine to come out of a group of gruesome, gore loving, riff-hitting, people hating, social misfits. The lyrics are intense and maniacal, the music never lets up in its ferocity, and the beats are just incredible. You are not likely to find anything harder in mainstream music stores. This is a metal masterpiece in every sense of the category. I would compare it to the likes of Reign in Blood, The Downward Spiral, and And Justice For All (Metallica's last great album...the last tolerable one for that matter).<br />If you dig heavy, merciless music, then you NEED this cd. I give it my highest rating. Long live Slipknot!!!!!
0553579908|5.0|In this book, Martin continues the saga he started in _A Clash of Kings_. Caution: If you have not read _A Game of Thrones_, start there. This series is contiguous, and you will spoil things for yourself if you don't read the books in order.<br />That said, if there are ever textbooks written for fantasy literature, George R.R. Martin's _Song of Fire and Ice_ series (or some part of it) will be included. The writing is brilliant. Each word counts. Phrases that are supposed to be witty actually ARE.

Any hit of the contents would spoil something for you, but I think I can say without giving away any secrets that a few viewpoint characters are added, and at least one viewpoint character killed. <br />Now... Read, read, read!
B000002HMH|1.0|This is pathetic. I can't believe people who think that Metallica are still worth listening to. Point in case: their newest single on the radio, St. Anger. (Sigh) Where did it all go wrong? Let me point out just what it was...<br />To go back to the very root of Metallica's musical deterioration, we should really be looking at the Black album. I guess in most Metallica fan circles, however, the Black album was the last great album. I disagree. I have always thought that And Justice For All was their last great album. Justice was a metal masterwork, with epic songs and brilliant lyrics. It was a fitting tribute to their dead bassist and friend, Cliff. It was their goodbye to Cliff as well as their goodbye to great music. <br />The Black album was more mainstream, the songs were compromised, the riffs sloppy, the lyrics silly, but it was still recognizable as Metallica<br />Fast foward four years. Load is released to perplexed fans. \\"Cut hair, pimp suits, goth makeup in their music videos? What? This is not Metallica!\\" And in a way, it wasn't. The Metallica the thrash metal fans knew died with the four year hiatus. They had finished grieving Cliff, and the spirit was gone. Cliff would never have allowed this Glam Rock/alt rock/blues/goth rock hybrid. It would have shamed him.<br />Metallica has become everything that they once claimed to have hated, and it really makes me sad. The music they made in years past was so EXCELLENT. Each one of their first four albums was a metal masterpiece, brilliant and well thought out. Now their music is a parody of what it once was. Until it Sleeps, the House That Jack Built...blech. Give me Harvester, Blackened, Master, Four Horsemen, anything but this drivel.

I would refur one to this move who likes lots of action and comdey in a move.

0006547745|5.0|A very well written book, with beautifully weaved historical, geographical and politicals elements related to a long list of  monasteries from Athos, Greece to Southestearn Turkey/Syria all the way to Egypt.  Highly readable! The relatively obscure history of Byzantium is unfolded in a very interested viewpoint.<BR>I was mostly impressed by the sharp analysis of the influences of neighboring religions/civilization on the evolution of christianity in the geographic area of Turkey/Syria/Iraq/Persia.
B00005RHGL|5.0|There are three reasons to own a copy of this movie, and two of them are portraits of souls entangled in lives dedicated to making the wrong choices. Doc Holliday's life isn't really the model of adjustment and happiness, either - but Mr Kilmer earns the right to be called &quot;Mister&quot; in this movie. He doesn't just portray The Man Gone Wrong - he takes a part that could have turned into a real floater and made it himself. Mr Kilmer IS John Holliday, odd Southern idiom and all. He is a profoundly sick man - in more ways than one - who shines in his devotion to the man who may just be his only friend in the world.
0066214122|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It's classic Chrichton: salvation in a utility closet; science in the service of profit; last minute deus ex machina from a helicopter; and pragmatic protagonists.  You can almost see the characters' hair blowing in backlit Spielberg way.  Cue John Williams music score....<br />What surprised me was the slice-of-life beginning of the main character: a whistle-blowing, down-sized, computer-geek, stay-at-home dad.  Then we get what Chrichton does best - explain science and technology in a compelling way.  In a nutshell, it was good storytelling.
B000099T2L|4.0|Thought I'd give it a little alliteration for you prose fanatics. I think this CD was a rejuvenator for my opinion of Beyonce. She has grown vocally and I must say I have always been a fan of her songwriting ability. At one point, everything was oversung, over yelled, over ran, but not on this joint. My faves are: Be Wit Chu, Me, Myself and I (absolutely love this one), Yes, Signs (LOVE IT, CREATIVE, NOT JUNK AS SOME REVIEWER STATED, and interestingly enough, TRUE descriptions of the zodiacs), How You Like It, and Daddy (such a tear jerker). Its a nice variation of songs, although I must admit I skim past most of the songs after 10, the end is a little weak. I don't think she needed the two appearances by Jay-Z, and an appearance by Big Boi, Sean Paul and Missy. She could have done a great job on the songs without them. I'd definitely recommend it for those of you who like a good CD you can take a road trip and listen to without too many &quot;skip&quot; movements.
B000001FMX|5.0|This is the pinnacle of the seedy little backroom art form known as rock'n'roll.  The first 15 seconds of \\"Personality Crisis\\" give you everything you need to know - a jet-engine guitar intro, a piano roll, and an unintelligible scream followed by \\"yeah-yeah-yeah, no, no, no, no-no-no, no!\\"  It's the Stones, Jerry Lee and Little Richard rocketed to the moon in a blinding flashpot explosion.  If you're old enough to be shopping online and don't own this already, you're a lost cause anyway.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is simply excellent. Each song brings something new and brings a stunning combination of unique vocals from Chris Martin and excellent guitar work, keyboarding, and drumming from the other 3 members. A quick review of all the songs:<br />Politik- It's rare to find such meaningful lyrics that contain a powerful message as 'Politik' does. The key words in this song are &quot;Open up your eyes.&quot; 9.5/10<br />In My Place- One of the first songs I heard from this group. I fell in love with the vocals and lyrics. 9.5/10<br />God Put a Smile on Your Face- Slightly more edgy, in my opinion. Brings a different sound. 8.5/10<br />The Scientist- I love everything about this song, from the lovely instrumental work to the heartfelt singing of the equally heartfelt lyrics. &quot;Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me/ Oh and I rush to the start.&quot; This is a very solid 10/10. <br />Clocks- The piano work for this is song is captivating. The song itself is very well done. 9/10<br />Daylight- Certainly different than the rest of the songs. It's not one of my favorites; I find it a bit repetitive. 7/10<br />Green Eyes- I love the acoustic parts of this song. The song starts slightly more quiet and simple, but in some parts it becomes more instrumental and loud. 9/10<br />Warning Sign- One of my favorites. The chorus is great; Chris's voice is so pure and longing. The end of the song ends with Chris singing &quot;Yes I'll crawl back/ Into your open arms&quot; in very high notes. Beautiful. 9.5/10<br />Whisper- Starts with a more edgy electric guitar playing, and takes it from there into one of the louder and more instrumented songs on the CD. 8.5/10<br />A Rush of Blood to the Head- A song with the same lyrical intensity and messages as 'Politik'. &quot;He said 'Oh I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war/ If you can tell me something worth fighting for.'&quot; 9.5/10<br />Amsterdam- There is a very nice blending of deeper back-up vocals with Chris's higher voice. It has a very soothing effect to it, but at the same time, there is a certain kind of intensity and meaning. 9.5/10<br />Overall, this CD is a very worthwhile album for purchase.
B00005Y7GQ|4.0|I very rarely (if ever) review movies. So why start now? Sometimes good things go unnoticed due to them being strange or not promoted right. Shaolin Soccer definitely falls into those categories. Movie is old by industry standards since it was made in 2001. It was recognized and wildly played in Asia and Europe but got none of the publicity in North America. Just like the title suggests Shaolin masters of Kung Fu are playing soccer. It's not another non stop Jackie Chan fighting movies. It has a decent plot; it has a fight between good and evil, greed and humbleness, lies and honesty. It teaches about friendship, being loyal, dedication and positive look on life regardless of the circumstances. And of course the special effects: amazing stunts and Matrix like action make it stand out from other Asian productions. Movie is well paced with no down time. Everything that happens, leads to more and more action. We have our share of baseball and football movies which all of them containing their dose of drama. Now it's time for a soccer movie. It's a bit of comedy mixed with action. Even if you've seen 1000 martial arts movies, even if you are sick and tired of sports genre flicks, see Shaolin Soccer. It is different and you will be glad you did.

B00006JJ1O|1.0|If it weren't for their lesbian and contraversial image, this group would never have gotten to this point with just their &quot;talent&quot; alone. This album comprises of nothing but them shrieking, and singing shrilly the same lines over and over again. A good example is the song Not Gonna Get Us in which they scream the title line repeatedly till you feel like punching your stereo or the TV. If you relish giving yourself a pounding headache then this is the album for you. If not, stay far far away.
B00005RZV4|4.0|This is really the best of both worlds, as it's basically a live greatest hits album. The live part of it is excellent, because the crowd noise is just right, and while the songs roughly stay true to the originals, there's enough difference to enjoy them being live. The song selection probably isn't everyone's idea of the best, but it's still mostly 16 tracks of NIN favorites taken almost evenly from each album. There is also the 2 disc version for the fanatics. Whichever you choose, it should go great with your live &quot;Marilyn Manson&quot; and &quot;Ministry&quot; discs.
0060555661|4.0|This book represents all things solid and stable in the world of stock market fluctuations that can turnabout on you in a second.

But if you stick through it and finish it, you'll find yourself much wiser.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Just as &quot;The Cars&quot; updated their 1985 greatest hits recently, this is a huge improvement over the previous &quot;Decade&quot; collection. This gets you 5 more songs, and tracks released since 1989. Not only does this include &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot;, but also &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;, which &quot;Decade&quot; did not have. Of the songs I didn't know, I like &quot;Serious&quot; alot, and of those I did, my favorite will always be &quot;Hungry like the Wolf&quot;. That song is pure 80's. As far as the edits go, I didn't even notice the difference. This should go great between your &quot;INXS&quot; and &quot;Culture Club&quot; cd's.
B000069HP6|2.0|When I think of the amount of money that went into making this film, compared to the amount of effort that apparently went into the script, I get weepy. This is exactly the type of film that Disney of the 1970s and 80s should not have been making. The Mouse House has no excuse for going through growing pains cinematically.<br />Quick plot: The great ship Argo is lost. Earth sends a crew of Anglo stereotypes to look for her, only to find the chief scientist has co-opted the ship, turned the crew into soulless zombies, and plans to prove his theories by throwing the great ship into a black hole.<br />Now I'll admit most kids didn't know too much about physics at the time, but more of us did than you might think. MAybe that's why we thought the movie was stupid. That, or the inane shooting gallery scene or the robot Stormtroopers or Maximillion, the bot with Cuisinarts for arms (although Anthony Hopkins dies real good from them).<br />In truth, that's what galls me about this film. They had a chance to get deep and dark here (as they have since), and Hopkins demise was an indicator of somebody's willingness to go there. But the rest of the film just felt like - um - a Disney movie, from the cinematography to the costumes. Eeeeesh.<br />I'll let my kid watch this as a cautionary tale of what NOT to do when offered a chance to film a science fiction thriller for Disney.
B00005NKK8|4.0|This is a good selection of rock and roll, but I don't think it's essential, unless &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is your favorite movie of all time. There's no point in complaining about what's not here since that would take weeks. But what was selected, was done so because I think it said something about the times, the way people were feeling, and about what was going on. I don't think anything was included just because it rocked. &quot;Elvis&quot; of course because he's the king. &quot;CCR&quot; probably because of wartimes. &quot;The Doors&quot; and &quot;Beach Boys&quot; might represent that California vibe. &quot;Dylan&quot; and &quot;Baez&quot; for the folk and beatnik scenes. I'm sure many of these artists mean different things to different people. The song I connect to the most is Nilsson's &quot;Everybody's Talkin'&quot;. For some reason it made me quit the military and move to New England. Of course all these songs can just be enjoyed without getting too deep about them. If you're looking for an eclectic mix of music from the 50's to the 80's, you should get your hands on &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.

B00003CX95|5.0|This is my most favorite movie in the whole wide world! Now, for a girl, I have to say that even the blood and gore scenes are good. They are very well put together and director, Mel Gibson, does a very good job in making them actually look realistic. The whole plot is very enticing, and if you like a little comic relief there's a little bit of that thrown in there as well.<br />I highly recomend this movie to anyone who likes a movie crampacked with action and drama.<br />Kudos to Mel Gibson as he stars and directs this piece.

B00006JL1Z|4.0|THE BAND: This compilation features the most recognizable members - Lindsey Buckingham (guitars, vocals), Mick Fleetwood (drums & percussion), Stevie Nicks (vocals, percussion), John McVie (bass), and Christine McVie (keyboards, vocals). Songs from early Fleetwood Mac featuring Peter Green, Bob Welch or Danny Kirwan are not present... nothing from 1968-74.<br /><br />THE DISC(S): (2002) 36 total tracks on 2 discs clocking in at approximately 141 minutes (disc-1 at 66+ minutes, and disc-2 at 75+ minutes). Included with the discs is a 14-page booklet containing 8-9 pages of written history of the band by Dave Wild (Rolling Stone magazine), many band pictures, song titles/credits, what songs came from which albums, year released, and chart success (if any) of each song. Disc-1 also features a bonus multimedia program for your PC - access to the Fleetwood Mac \\"Vault\\" (live shows & videos), discography, song lyrics, a historical documentary on the band, and various web links. Including the 3 live tracks, this set follows their career from 1975 through 1997. Digitally remastered sound. Label - Warner Bros.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This is a great mix of Fleetwood Mac. A ton of music and a ton of big hits... even tho it's not the \\"complete\\" compilation of the band itself. The Bob Welch and Peter Green era are knowingly omitted. Fleetwood Mac has been around for 30+ years and has created many albums... and this collection only takes tracks from 6 studio albums. Also noted are 4 songs (\\"Rhainnon\\", \\"Over My Head\\", \\"Think About Me\\" and \\"Sisters Of The Moon\\") that are shorter radio edits (I hate when they do this). You could go so far as saying this is a HITS package, as opposed to a \\"HISTORY\\" package (the history package is where the 4-cd box set comes into play). \\"Rumours\\" is well represented here (9 of the 11 songs are here). \\"Tusk\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac\\", \\"Mirage\\", \\"Tango In The Night\\", \\"The Dance\\" (live), \\"Behind The Mask\\", and \\"25 Years - The Chain\\" (an import best of package) all have 2-3 songs (or more) represented here. You will find nothing on this 2-cd set from the following Fleetwood Mac releases: \\"Kiln House\\", \\"Bare Trees\\", \\"Penguin\\", \\"Future Games\\", \\"Heroes Are Hard To Find\\", \\"Mystery To Me\\", or \\"Time\\"... again, many of these are prior to 1975 as well as featuring Bob Welch and/or Peter Green. Fleetwood Mac's \\"Greatest Hits\\" from 1988 is now moot - every song is now on this 2-cd package. There are a few throw-away songs here (\\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Family Man\\", \\"Paper Doll\\"), but over all the song selection here is dead on accurate. Fleetwood Mac has put out some great FM-radio friendly songs over the last few decades and despite the omission of any \\"early\\" songs, it really is a fine representation of the band playing their best stuff at their peak of popularity (4.5 stars).or more) represented here.

B00005JM09|3.0|I don't know how much I can say about why I didn't like this movie without giving away much of the plot. I will say this, I was very excited to see this movie and was very disapointed from the very beginning. <br />The plot is simple, cause it was already done. A terminator is sent back from the future to kill John Connor. Another terminator is sent back to protect him. Sound familiar? That part I could have dealt with. Sure it's been done, but with the advances in technology, this could have worked.<br />The following gives away key plot information, so do not read on if you don't want to know what happens!<br />When T2 came out, when they showed that the reason T2 happened is because pieces of the original terminator were found in the factory but that was covered up, that plot made sense. And it was predicted that the premise for T3 was the part of his arm that arnold left in the big gear in the steel factory at the end. They destroyed everything but that one piece, leaving them an opening for T3. <br />But then in T3 they basically say that T2 was never even necessary! John supposedly met this chick the day before the second terminator arrived and they were supposed to get together then but that was all disrupted by the appearance of the second terminator. This was stupid.<br />Secondly, in T3 it was emphasized time and time again that the arnold terminator in T3 was NOT the same as the arnold terminator in T2. Even John Connor in T3 says he \\"you mean I got to teach you everything over again?\\" From the opening scene where arnold looks in the visor for the keys to the truck he steals, to where he comes out of the cemetary and shoots a million rounds of ammo but doesn't kill anybody. These were things that john had to teach him in T2, but in T3 he knew these things already? And how was he to learn anything anyways? In T2 they had to remove his CPU and switch it from read-only in order for him to learn. They didn't do this in T3. <br />Point #3. You find out your fiancee is dead and you get over that in less than 5 minutes? Come on. <br />And what was the deal with the sunglasses? In T1 arnold needed the gargoyle sunglasses to cover his eye which he had to operate on because it was damaged by a shotgun blast. When arnold grabbed the sunglasses out of the barkeeps pocket in T2, it was a stetch, but it fit so it was ok. But what the hell was his fascination with the shades in T3? They really served no purpose. Was this to just make fun of the first two movies? Who knows. There's a lot of who knows in this movie.<br />If arnold tells him that he is killed in the future, then wouldn't john do something different to not get killed? And then if he did do something different, then would arnold come back and still tell him he gets killed? A temporal paradox. The movie is loaded with those also. <br />T1, and T2, for the most part, to any reasonable person, came to an ending, a conclusion, the movie was over. What the heck is the deal with the ...ending to this movie? I got to thinking to myslef, was the whole point of T3 just to set up for T4 and beyond?<br />The whole message from T1 and T2 is that the future is not set. That it can be changed. There is no future but the one you make for yourself. But the whole message of T3 is that you can NOT change the future, only delay it. Kind of depressing message ain't it and completely contradictory to the first two films, the GOOD films. You know, the 2 films that [weren't bad]. <br />I really wish I would have waited and rented this. Yes, the film had lots and lots of explosions, and crashes and all that nice blow 'em up stuff you might enjoy. But the one thing, the most important thing, the STORY, is lost. <br />and by the way, where was the family who owned the motor home that they stole anyways? They just pull up and drive away with it and nobody is around? Maybe I missed that part. <br />At least with lord of the rings part 2, and matrix part 2, stars wars 2 (the empire strikes back) and even the back to the future part 2, they told you up front that there would be another movie, that they were just part of the story. There was never any indication that T3 would just leave you hanging. But it did, and in a VERY VERY BAD way. <br />The only reason I gave this film 3 stars was because of the action and destruction. If that would have been lacking, then it for sure deserved no more than a 2 for the story alone.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I apologize for not agreeing with the masses here, but this movies was one of the biggest let downs for me this year.  <BR>   The visuals were stunning, hence the 1 star.  Aside from that, the movie was long....OK, really long, and instead of that time being used to draw you in and personalize you to the movie, it just kind of dragged on.  I felt that ending was rushed and diluted (I don't want to throw out any spoilers hence my somewhat vague decriptions). Maybe it was that the story (or the way it was told) seemed shallow, transparent, and moodless, though the sets did help in the mood department slightly.      <BR>   I think Scorsese had a pontential winner here, but he didnt pull it off, at least for me.
0316666343|5.0|From the very first sentence I could not put this book down. I initally thought I wouldn't want to read about such a grim storyline...but Sebold creates just the right balance between  sad facts and future hopes. Sure, there are a couple parts that seem almost too coincidental...but I found myself too wrapped up in believing and hoping for things--right along with Susie--that it didn't matter. When I got to the very end, I actually found myself missing Susie Salmon. I can't remember too many books having that kind of effect on me. This is one book you don't want to miss.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There are far too many negative comments on this review board. I would have to say that this is one of a very few &quot;new&quot; albums I own, but it is one of the best I have. Granted, these songs are strange and sometimes embarassing, but give them a chance and they will find their way into your heart with no judgements attached. I am not going to go into what songs are good, and what songs are bad. Find out for you self, they will move around on your charts. You wont like them all at once, or hate them all at once. There will always be 2 or 3 that stick out when you listen, and they will change, then eventually you put the CD away and find something else. Hey, if you like this kind of stuff, it's well worth the money, because some of this a trip, let me tell you.
B00008976Y|5.0|Three Colors: Blue is the first film in a trilogy that depicts liberty, which is one of the national French mottos.  Julie (Juliette Binoche) is the sole survivor in a car accident where she loses her husband and daughter.  She falls into a depression where she begins to rid herself of everything that reminds her of her departed husband.  In the process of freeing herself from her husband who was a prominent composer, she cuts off all ties from her past by moving to an undisclosed location in Paris.  She attempts to withdraw from people and live in seclusion, however, several situations force her to keep contact with people from her present and past existence.  The past that she makes an effort to avoid seems to draw her back to the social milieu and it seems like the past also helps to heal her spiritual wounds.  Blue is a powerful film that grabs the audience and forces the viewer through a private cerebral catharsis.  In addition, there are several elements and sub plots that encourage self-reflection and individual growth.  Lastly, the film is a cinematographic masterpiece that offers a brilliant cinematic experience.
B00005NP04|5.0|I haven't bought this CD (YET) but I have heard the song Concrete Angel.  It isthe most touching thing i have ever heard. It is a song about child abuse. It is extreamly well done, Martina does an excellant job on this song.  She sings so powerfully. I am going to buy this CD A.S.A.P.! You should too! I rated the CD five stars but i really am rateing the song Concrete Angel as five stars.  It is really a gorgus song.  I apologize for my spelling in this review.  Im 13 and Im not that good of a speller (laugh).  Thanks for reading!
0767817710|4.0|Although released in early 1995, this was one of the last westerns to come out at the height of the western craze of 1993 & 1994>>(Tombstone, Maverick ETC.) After baring all for \\"Basic Instinct\\" & The Specialist\\", Sharon Stone decided to do somthing that not only kept her clothes on, but was different, In this she is a modern day man-with-no-name type who rides into town on a secret agenda to take revenge against the town's owner & sherriff(Gene Hackman, who almost plays the same character here that he played in \\"Unforgiven\\") who murdered her widowed father when she was a child, & as she puts it, stole her life, she soon signes up for a gunfight contest as a possible way to get him, which has some of the most funniest & most memorable characters, with Leonardo DiCaprio as the cocky son of Hackman, with Lance Henrickson(The Terminator) as an ace shooter, with Keith David(Armageddon) as a secret assasin, & Kevin Conway(\\"Streets of Laredo\\") as a dirty old man who likes to fondle teenage girls, to a whacked out Indian who can't be killed by one bullet to Russell Crowe in his screen debut as a preacher that has renounched violence & is constantly harassed & intimidated by Hackman who wants to bring out the killer that Crowe once was, every whacked out character is here, as they compete in the gunfight one after the other, in scenes that are somewhat comical in their approach, Directed by Sam Raimi(Spiderman), this is a crowd pleaser for western fans!!!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Ok.  Lucas had a brain cramp when he created the medichlorians none sense.  And what is this about &quot;The chosen One&quot;?  But this is a very good movie!  <br />The purpose of this movie was to introduce us to Lukes parents and the Jedi temple as it existed during the Republic.  It also introduces us Darth Sidious - Palpatine - The Evil Emperor.<br />The music is chillingly outstanding.  The door opens with Maul standing there and John Williams song &quot;duel of the Fates&quot; starts.  What a moment in movie history.  Then we are treated to an incredible, high energy light saber duel like nothing ever seen on screen.<br />Yes there are dumb things to criticize.  An elected Queen-ruler of a planet who is 16 years old?  Darth Vader didn't recognize R2D2 or C3PO. Jar Jar isn't so bad... he spakes!
B0000033P0|5.0|Finally!...at least a few other people who feel like I do about this album!...i grew up in the horrible &quot;disco days&quot; (born in '63)...found &quot;Tarkus&quot; in my older brothers collection, played it...then (like everyone else who's listened to this)...took a deep breath, and thought...&quot;what the HELL? :)&quot;...then got into punk, then got into indies, then got into even Irish Folk (&quot;trad&quot;)...but every year or so i'd put on Tarkus again...and i kept finding more that i liked every time...<br />...this was a &quot;concept album&quot; before there WAS such a phrase<BR>...these guys used synthesizers, when no one knew what they were<BR>...they did WHATEVER they wanted to on Tarkus - i can remember scathing reviews from Rolling Stone, i.e. -&quot;this is not rock music!...If they want to do &quot;classical&quot; they should rent out the Albert Hall!...&quot;...<br />...and, yes, i DO buy into another reviewers note: i dont beleive that it was overly pre-rehearsed either...they did &quot;overdubs&quot; and etc, but the 1st side of Tarkus still feels to me like they were just having FUN...(but remember - these guys were classically-trained...veterans of the scene even in 1971...its not just a &quot;jam&quot;...actually?...reminds me of James Joyce :) )
B00008DDRX|5.0|Having competed at an amateur level in various classes of road racing in North America in the 80's, I can testify this is the real deal. I felt the driver's pain as they competed through the rainy night.<br />Whoever was reponsible for the film to DVD conversion created a masterpiece. I don't know how they derived the DD 5.1 (reg trademark) (perhaps they set up mic trees and re-recorded from the original theater suround sound?)<BR>Video bit-rates are super high so all the racing action scenes are super clear and brilliant. All and all a technical masterpiece. A really nice gift for your high-end home theater system.<br />NOTE: This review applies to the 2003 DVD release. The earlier VHS release was dissappointing to me.
B000069AUI|5.0|Reviewer: ymms from United States<BR>Coldplay are extremely talented musicians. If you enjoyed Parachutes, than A Rush Of Blood To The Head will live up to your<BR>expectations of a sophomore album. This record is centered on strong vocals and instrument playing, heartfelt lyrics, and that<BR>special magical feeling that Parachutes left you with. Coldplay... I can't say enough about these guys- definitely worth the money. if you're deliberating on whether or not to purchase... BUY IT!
B000000176|5.0|I discovered this album at age 5 back in 1969.  My brother had just bought it, and from that day forward I haven't looked back.  At that age, it was perfect hearing The Doors come into existence (aquiring the taste) with &quot;Hello I Love You&quot; and &quot;Love Street&quot;  for someone so young. NOW, my mind was blown open for heavier stuff like &quot;Not To Touch The Earth&quot; and &quot;Five To One&quot;.  If I would have heard &quot;Break On Through&quot; from the first album, it would have been too threatening, and &quot;Strange Days&quot; would have been too .....well.....strange.   After I had wore that album down to the point it was smooth as glass a year later, I got the first album (threw a crying fit on Christmas to get it),  then a year later the 2nd Doors album, and then skipped over to The Soft Parade and on to the last.  I wouldn't have done it in any other order.
B000001FKY|5.0|This here is what pop metal is all about. 7 singles released, 6 hitting the top 20. Not one weak track on this record in my eyes, every track could have been a top 20 smash. It has gone on to sell 12 million copies in the U.S and 17 million all together, an impressive feat. Here is my track by track review of Def Leppards Hysteria:<BR>1. Women- An excellent opening track. Would have hit the top 20, had it been released earleir. Only hit #80. A mid tempo song, and the end gutair solo always gives me chills. 10/10<BR>2. Rocket- An epic that was shortened on the Vault- Def Leppards greatest hits. An excellent song with a nice middle, and a fist pumping chorus. Hit #12. 10/10<BR>3. Animal- A nice little pop rock tune that screamed radio. A catchy chorus and solid verses and gutair playing make this a great song. Hit #19. <BR>4. Love Bites- Ah yes. The love/ power ballad everyone has heard. Great chorus, sentimental lyrics make this song a smash. Hit #1. 10/10<BR>5. Pour Some Sugar On Me- The song everyone has heard. Leppards most recognizable song, is a great one. Different sounding then most their songs, but its still great. Hit #2. 10/10<BR>6. Armageddon It- My fav. song on this album, and along with Photograph, my fav. Leppard song. Great Chorus and great playing by the band make it top notch. The end gives me chills. Hit #3. 10/10<BR>7. Gods of War- The epic on the album, like Die Hard the Hunter off Pyromania. Great song, if it would have been released, it prob. would have been shortened taking away its power. Great song! 10/10<BR>8. Don't Shoot Shotgun- Maybe the weakest track on the album along with L+A. But the weakest on this album still makes it an excellent song, still single material. More fast paced then most on the album. 9.5/10<BR>9. Run Riot- This use to be my fav. song from the Lep when I was a little kid. Great fast paced rock with a catchy chourus and awesome verses, and an amazing guitar solo by the late Steve Clark. Spectacular! 10/10<BR>10. Hysteria- The last single on the album, but a great one at that. Nice ballad that was perfect for radio. As good as Love Bites in my eyes. Hit #10. 10/10<BR>11. Excitable- I love this song! Sure it gets repetitive, but it still is great. I love the verses and the chorus. It could have been a great single, but because of its dance like beat, the Lep would be called ultimate sell outs. 10/10<BR>12. Love and Affection- A great song, but not as strong as Hysteria or Love Bites. Nonetheless, a touching ballad with a very strong eneding. Single worthy. 9.5/10<br />Overall this is what pop metal was all about. Def Leppard are masters of the rock genre, after all, they havent sold over 30 million records in the U.S because they [are bad]. this is my fav. band at their prime, so go on, pick up your copy of Hysteria and be ready for the ride of a lifetime!
B000000WHH|5.0|This album was THE release of the 1980s.  Not only did it spawn one of the most widely recognized tunes of the decade, (and yes, maybe a little annoying), &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;, but also the masterful &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot;, &quot;It's a Miracle&quot;, &quot;Miss Me Blind&quot; and &quot;Victims&quot; (in the UK).  Now that's FIVE hits out of TEN songs on the album.  50% is pretty darned good, not to mention the cult favorite &quot;Black Money&quot;.  <br />This album made Culture Club an American household name.  It also put Helen Terry in the limelight as the power-vocal female backup singer.  Who wasn't wondering &quot;who is that woman singing on Church&quot;?  This album also expressed that the band was truly one entity.  Everything flowed smoothly and was effortless during performances.  <br />Of all the Culture Club releases, this is my favorite.  It also contains my favorite song ever, &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot;.  I can hear that harmonica playing as I write...
B00005JLSE|5.0|Having seen and loved CHICAGO and its original cast on Broadway, and knowing what Hollywood has done to excellent musicals in the past (taking songs out, writing new songs for the film, changing the ending as well as the plot, etc., etc.,), I was reluctant to see how they might have mangled this fine show, and I resisted seeing it for a while.  I finally was asked to join friends after hearing the good reviews and was WAY MORE than pleasantly surprised!  I think this is one of the best screen adaptations I have evere experienced and deserves every prize and praise it has received!  I knew that it would have to be \\"adapted\\" for the screen, and they did a wonderful job, and the choreography, adapted from Bob Fosse's original, is tops!  I could see it again and again.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira has done an amazing job of putting her songs together with some amazing music. She has crossed over from Latin music to American with an amount of flare that seems almost impossible.<BR>But the thing i like most about her singing is how she can make a song that seems to fit a part of your life so very well, and make it so it hits you hard. Shakira is definetly a star to be reckoned with. Plus you gotta admit the woman is hotter than a flaring sun. WOW!!! Her song: \\"Whenever, Whereever\\" , is a song that will make anyone think about love and life....5 stars from me.

B000007QQQ|5.0|John Martyn's beautiful songs have a way of threading themselves through your subconscious. He says so much about love, loss and just being human it makes you grateful someone can give voice to those feelings you have trouble expressing. He's subtle, raunchy and exquisitely tender. 'Head and Heart' is as pure a piece of vulnerability in love as any to be found, realistic and optimistic but so touching.Once you have this music it will be with you throughout your life, it becomes part of what makes you tick, it's music to live your life by and with.
0064407667|5.0|I felt compelled to write after seeing people miss the point. \\"oh, these stories are dark\\"...\\"oh, there doesn't seem to be a moral...\\". Get Over It. If there must be a moral, it is that bad things can happen to good people, that heroes are people who never give up, and villians can be flat out evil (Olaf) or simply lazy (Poe, or any of the other useless adults) - think Voldemort and Cornelius Fudge in HPV - a useful moral if EVER I saw one.<br />A friend recommended these books to me and I'm halfway through the series. These books are a linguistic treat, a metaphor-rich collection of unfortunate events. If your kids are reading these, you should too, so that you can talk to them about what happens (good advice about any book, really). <br />Keep up the good work, Mr Snicket - the children's story must be told!!!
B00005JKN9|1.0|Gangs of New York is one of those films that the critics love because it is directed by a darling of the critic set: Martin Scorcese and stars a moody, self absorbed Acadamy Award winning actor: Daniel Day Lewis. It also stars the much ballyhooed Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz.<br />For a film that is set in 1800's New York - lower east and west side - it gets the MGM musical treatment for sets and set dressing. In other words, everything is very clean looking (for a slum) and the clothing is colorful and you expect at any moment the actors will break into song. The film \\"From Hell\\" is set in a later time in England (and it and New York would be much the same as London for the time) and it looks appropriate dismal and dirty.<br />Day Lewis is playing to the back rows. In other words, he's really hamming it up - and that's not a good thing. DiCaprio is horribly miscast (remember this film started shooting not long after Titanic was released and he was the \\"it\\" boy at the time) and is completely unbelievable in the role. Likewise, Diaz is far too proper looking. These people all have their own teeth and even bright white smiles - this would not have been the case.<br />The action around which this movie is centered is portrayed incorrectly and in doing so the entire point of the film is nothing more than a Hollywood version of history. This isn't a bad thing - Hollywood's been doing it for years - EXCEPT that the producers and director, in the DVD extras and the promotional material would have us believe that what they've crafted is historically correct.<br />Watch this film if you want to see some of your favorite actors working their craft. If you're expecting a really good film with great performances and historical context - FA GHET ABOUD IT! It isn't here.<br />Oh, yeah, though the promos tell you otherwise - this is so NOT an action film!
B000000H64|5.0|This album should have been a 4.9 long, long, ago. Death metal, thrash metal, industrial, goth, techno, grindcore, alternative, you name it, it's here. Bell, although occasionally off-key, is an amazing growler and even better clean singer, with a deep gothic voice that chills the spine. Dino is the riff master, each being effortlessly catchy and bonecrushingly brutal. He also played the bass here, but Christian Olde-Wolbers delivered the punch live. Rhys Fulber from FLA contributed the awesome synths and turntables(check out \\"Zero Signal\\" and \\"New Breed\\"), and the drum king Raymond Herrera behind the set with his jackhammer double bass, mechanical cymbal/snare work and amazing Police-esque drum grooves(check out \\"Dog Day Sunrise,\\" the Head Of David cover). <br />This is one of the greatest metal albums ever, especially in the last decade, influencing nearly EVERYONE, from SYL to Chimaira to Killswitch Engage to Static-X to...geez, everyone. It must be heard to be believed. The opening drums to \\"Replica,\\" the anthemic chorus to the title track, the guitar slide on \\"Body Hammer\\"(listen closely), the warp speed drums and scary ending in \\"Self Bias Resistor,\\" and the keyboard-filled epic closer, \\"Therapy For Pain.\\" It's genius.<br />Support this album. I only hope they reform. Metal NEEDS Fear Factory, and every self-respecting metalhead or music fan NEEDS this slab of musical perfection:<br />Fear Factory's Joshua Tree...
B00005YW4H|2.0|I find Norah Jones vocals to be boring at best.  My daughters had more exciting voices when they were 6.  It amazes and saddens me to see someone like Norah Jones have the record sales she does, while singers like Debelah Morgan with an unbelievable voice fade into obscurity. But then, with &quot;singers&quot; like 50 Cent leading in record sales as well, I guess I shouldn't be so surprised.

Maybe this: All the songs contributed by Lennon were inspired by printed or visual material. &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot; was inspired by his son Julian's drawing titled same. &quot;Good Morning&quot; inspired by a Kellogg's Corn Flake ad on tv. &quot;Mr. Kite&quot; was based on a circus poster, words copied ver batum. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; inspired by newspaper articles about the traffic death of an member of the wealthy Guinness family and repairs to the Albert Hall.  Lennon often read several books at one time and was known to watch two or more tv shows at once.  Maybe this lent itself to his seemingly off handed juxtaposition of words that strike the listener as fresh and meaningful.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The best piece of work I have heard all year.  Period.<br />I was extremely saddend when At The Drive In broke up.  However, out of the ashes, comes this, a wonderful CD that puts everything ATDI did to shame.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This is a excellent cd. Santana really knows how to play a guitar. There is a varienty of sounds that you will never get bored with listening to this cd. I like to listen to this when I am relaxing and don't want to watch TV or read. It is really the best cd in my collection. I like that Santana has other artists perform with him. That in itself is a treat.
B00005JKWI|5.0|I could not have even imagined they could come up with such new and exciting vampire &quot;rules of the game&quot;.  They had excellent computer graphics, with a science fiction &quot;atmosphere&quot; and a great plot!!  Can't wait to see #3!!
B00005QW4K|4.0|This is one of the greatest comedy/horror movies ever, taking the bizzareness of Bruce Campbell and some... &quot;interesting&quot; special effects scenes and combining them to make a movie which can only be called &quot;wierd, but in a good way.&quot;<br />Unfortunately I didn't buy the right DVD of this great movie.  This version may contain the original ending, but it left out the other, alternate ending, which in my mind was about as funny as the original ending.  It didn't seem to have many special features, which I do remember the version I rented having (although I had things to do, so I didn't get to watch them).  If you want to get this movie, I don't think this would be the version you want.
B00005JMC6|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this film, which manages to be both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. Keisha Castle-Hughes is a terrific young actress, and the message of the film, that fate can choose great things for you even if no one around you sees them coming, is incredibly touching.<br />I've never seen anything like WHALE RIDER. And, wiping the tears from my eyes after the first viewing, I knew I'd want to share the experience with as many people as possible.

The energy of this song so great and the scream at the end just pumps you up.1000000000/10<br />4.Idiot Box- This song is about what life would be like without television. It's not their best song but it's pretty good.6/10<br />5.Glass- This is one of my favs. It starts with an awesome, funky bass line and goes into a great rock song.9/10<br />6.Magic Medicine- After the first time you listen to it you hardly listen to it again, because after that this song is just boring.5/10<br />7.A Certain Shade Of Green- This is a bada** song it has the best intro.Words cannot discribe this song.10/10<br />8.Favorite Things-This is a great song to listen to if you and your girlfriend/boyfriend are arguing.9/10<br />9.Summer Romance(Anti-Gravity Love Song)-This is the best jazzy song by Incubus(better than most stuff on Fungus Amongus)This song is awesome.10/10<br />10.Nebula- Not everyone likes this song but I think it's good because how they sing it and the beginning is great.9/10<br />11.Deep Inside- This is a pot-song,\\"I'm so stoned, I can't see strait.\\" It's also a great party song, it's awesome.9/10<br />12.Calgone- This song starts slow and builds to a great hard song.<br />(Hidden Track).Jose loves Kate Moss Pt.1-This is a boring hidden track. Most of the stuff plays on the DVD, When Incubus Attaks Vol.1 but its still cool.<br />This a great cd, I highly recomend it.This is their only cd,so far, with them playing like this, I hope they make more cd's like this.

0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is a biting satire about the absurdities of war.  Set in World War 2, the novel is about a squadron of bomber crews stationed in Pianosa.  The book follows the exploits of the group, and of one man in particular: a bomber named Yossarian.  Yossarian goes against the grain, and tries valiantly throughout the novel to escape the inevitable Catch-22.  All Yossarian wants to do is survive the war, but that seems impossible in the face of Catch-22.  This novel is about his struggle against the system, his personal quest for survival in the face of a military that sees him only as part of the war effort.  <BR> <BR>Several things--a colonel who's aspiring to be a general and keeps upping the required number of missions, a mess hall attendant who forms his own syndicate and sells supplies to the enemy to gain a profit, a major who disappears inside his trailer--combine to form the military unit to which Yossarian belongs, where \\"what's good for the syndicate is good for the country\\" and where men are endangered and their lives sacrificed for the ambitions of higher-ranking men aspiring to fortune and notoriety.<BR> <BR>This book would be depressing--horribly depressing--were it not so downright funny.  The situations, the way the characters react and interact with each other, are absurd and hilarious.  In fact, the attitudes of most of these men (commanders in particular) are downright ridiculous, and the book is not realistic in terms of the characters personalities (how many generals REALLY believe they can order someone to be shot whenever they want?).  Still, the absurd nature of the book is what gives it such power.  By giving his characters such outrageous ambitions and by creating such ridiculous situations for them, Heller makes his message painfully clear.<BR> <BR>This book is a modernist approach to war.  The narrative is fragmented and roughly pieced together, and the satire is very prominent and in-your-face.  In the end, Yossarian is faced with a choice: submit to the `Catch,' or die trying to escape it.  The irony of it all--submit to the Catch and be a hero (though morally dead) or try to escape it and be physically dead--is what makes Yossarian such a powerful character.  This book is one of the greatest works of the 20th century for a reason--the impression it leaves is very lasting.
0060012218|4.0|Remember all of those social cliques in high school? Remember the pain of feeling left out? Remember feeling as if you were the only one who felt as you did? Brent Hartinger does, and he captures those feelings honestly and effectively in his new book for teens, \\"Geography Club\\".<br />Russel is your Joe Average teen struggling with being gay in admist all of the usual teenage angst that comes with high school. Russel's convinced he's the only gay teen in the school, until one night, in a chat room, he discovers another. They plan a secret rendezvous, and Russel is genuinely shocked to discover the identity of that person. Thus starts the plot of \\"Geography Club\\".<br />As soon as Russel discovers other gay teens in his high school, they attempt to form a support group. Hoping to dissuade others from joining, they dub it the moniker \\"Geography Club\\".<br />What ensues is an interesting, intriguing story. Clearly written for teenagers, the style of writing is appropriate for the audience, if not particularly deep for adults. The characters do sparkle alive, and there never was a false moment in any character, especially with Brain Bund. Brain plays the schools nerdy loser, who is at the receiving end of all the schools pranks. Hartinger does a great job making him as three-dimensional as the rest, and you feel real sympathy for his pain.<br />What this book does for adults is evoke long lost feelings about what it was like in high school for those of us struggling to keep ourselves a secret. But more importantly, what this book does for kids is offer a ray of light, an outreach to them. This is the perfect book for the gay kid living in a small town in Anywhere U.S.A., who needs someone or something to identify with. Had this book been around when I was in high school, my life may have been much different.<br />Thanks to Hartinger for writing such a daring, honest book, and for creating the Geography Club to begin with!
B00005JKN9|3.0|Great depictions of 19th century New York.  The sets are amazing and the topic is a great one.<br />Unfortunately the story itself and many of the actors are a let down.  Daniel Day Louis is excellent and deserved the academy award.  Sadly, Leonardo Di Caprio and Cameron Diaz are not right for their parts or this movie. Particulary Diaz who just does not have the right look for this period piece (and is simply homely unless attired in a bikini).  Some of the supporting cast are good but Liam Nielson is terribly under utilized.<br />The film's storyline is not very enthralling and does a poor job of integrating the history with the tale being told.  The whole film really needed some lighter moments despite the seriousness of the underlying facts and history.<br />I enjoyed the DVD's background look at the sets and set design as well as the Discovery Channel program \\"The Real Gangs of New York\\" more than I did the actual movie.<br />And oh yeah, it is pretty grissly and do not watch this if you have a phobia about knives or sharp objects. I would not say that the violence and gore stoops to the level of gross however.

B000096IBI|5.0|Modern Times (1936) is quite possibly the defining picture of Charlie Chaplin's career.  I've been renting Chaplin movies lately and Modern Times is by far the best one that I've seen.  The Little Tramp (Chaplin) is a factory worker who has been working on the assembly line a bit too long.  Even not on the line, he finds his hands making the movements that he did when working.  He goes a little kooky and finds himself taking the blame for stealing bread to protect a young woman (Paulette Goddard).  The Tramp also inexplicably steals from a couple of merchants and requests that the police officer nearby pay for it.  This lands him in jail. He gets out, but lands himself right back in jail when he appears to lead a communist workers revolt.<br />The film focuses on the Tramps relationship with the woman as well as his attempts to work in the factory (several different jobs).  The funniest stuff is in the factory as Chaplin lets loose with his trademark physical humor.  I think this is Chaplin's best and most well-crafted films and if he is only remembered for one film, it should be this one.

0312263120|3.0|Like so many of the reviewers here, I got hooked on Dan Brown with DaVinci Code.  A great, fun read.  He makes you feel like you've taken the worlds most exciting university class.  He is a thinking person's Clive Cussler.  <BR>DaVinci Code inspired me to read Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress.  They have gotten progressively weaker in my mind (which means his work has gotten progressively better since I'm reading in reverse chronological order).<BR>Digital Fortress absolutely kept my attention and interest.  However, I have two main gripes.<BR>SPOILERS TO FOLLOW<BR>Each of the three books I mention have exactly the same plot and twist structure: An academic is pulled unwillingly into a James Bond movie; he hooks up with a beautiful, brilliant woman; the bad guy ALWAYS turns out to be the mentor figure; and there is a mysterious, somehow deformed assasin who we come to learn is in the employ of the mentor.  After you've read one book, the suspense is gone.<BR>Also, as brilliant as these characters are supposed to be, I consistently guess the clues before they do and I'm no university professor.  Digitial Fortress is the worst offender of the last type.  <BR>Nevertheless, Brown is in a special class and I do look forward to his follow up to DaVinci Code.

I must say...if you're brave enough to viewed this film go ahead...make your bones chills and please don't watch it alone when you cannot handle it's horrific elements! <br />Absolutely the best horror film ever made! My favorite all-time horror movie. No shattered bloods, no extreme cunning, no exagerrated scream...it's pure serious horror that will disturb you even when you are asleep. It's so freaky scary!!!! Linda Blair scares the hell out of me with her turning freaky head!<BR>Those 12 minutes deleted images surely will make you caught attended!
B000063DHK|5.0|Captured at the peak of their powers during their massive 11-month marathon around the world known as &quot;The World Slavery Tour&quot; in 1984 and '85, LIVE AFTER DEATH is the most famous and celebrated of Iron Maiden's live recordings and deservedly so.  It has attained huge legendary status - so much so that other live heavy metal albums have had to catch up during its wake.  Although I slightly prefer Maiden's most recent live album ROCK IN RIO a little bit more (Bruce's overall performance is more powerful at that show, and the addition of third guitarist Janick Gers brings out more in Maiden's sound than ever before), LAD is still one corker of a live concert.<br />Pretty much all of Maiden's best songs from their first five albums are presented in full, rampaging glory on stage as only the band can do them.  After starting the concert with a clever snippet of Winston Churchill's famous WWII speech preceeding the fiery war anthem &quot;Aces High,&quot; the band is off and never slows down for the remaining 75 minutes.  The production by then-producer Martin Birch is top-notch.  The sound is raw and crystal-clear at the same time, and the use of the dual guitar work of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith is very smart (you hear Murray on the left speaker, and Smith on the right).  The entire performance is endlessly aggressive and Bruce Dickinson leads the way, getting the crowd into the songs at certain spots.<br />And it ain't over yet, folks!  As an added bonus, there's a second disc comprised of 5 extra songs recorded at London's Hammersmith Odeon that were originally cut out of the original vinyl copies because of time constraints.  Even though the disc is short at a paltry 26 minutes, it's still just as blistering and intense as the longer disc.  It's great to finally hear &quot;22 Acacia Avenue,&quot; &quot;Children of the Damned,&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; live since the band rarely plays these songs anymore, or any of the other songs on disc1 for that matter.<br />I think the album speaks for itself, really.  LIVE AFTER DEATH is essential to any serious music fan's collection, and if you're a newcomer to Maiden, this would be a great place to start (but start with the studio albums first if you can).  <br />By the way, here are the highlights of the disc 1 songs: &quot;The Trooper,&quot; &quot;Revelations,&quot; &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name,&quot; &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (the best live version of this signature song by far), &quot;Running Free&quot; (with that great crowd interaction part with Bruce - very funny stuff), and stunning renditions of the 13-minute masterpiece &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and the immortal &quot;Powerslave.&quot;
0393057658|5.0|Highly engaging, delightful and heartwarming read, especially for lapsed baseball fans and those who still appreciate baseball. Lewis blends a love of the game, with a desire to really understand what it takes to win and the lives of some of those who make it all happen. <br />Lewis makes a clear case for competent management in baseball or, as featured general manager Billie Beane points out: In what other organization do you let the show be run by middle management. Or as another wag says: At age fifteen, most of what you now about baseball comes from announcers and eighty percent of what they know is wrong.<br />Oakland GM Beane has studied baseball as a process that produces results. And rather than count on traditional statistics, he learned that many of the things ballplayers and managers think are important just aren't that important. Using much of the Bill James approach (a baseball fan and analyst from Lawrence, Kansas who for the past twenty-five years helped re-invent the way we look at baseball), Beane appreciates batters who don't make outs and who have the patience to take a walk. Beane penalizes his minor league managers when their players fall behind in the walks per at bat ratio. Home runs matter more than stolen bases and sacrifice bunts. In brief, not making an out, e.g., a failed stolen base attempt, `manufactures' (a favorite baseball verb) more runs than does speed on the base paths. Getting on base and getting extra bases matters more than a high batting average. Pitchers have little control over what happens once a ball is hit into play. Walks, strikeouts and home runs matter more than ERA. While skill matters, luck has an even larger impact on the success or failure of each game.<br />And there are colorful stories of real people who don't fit the traditional baseball mold yet who make big contributions, truly undervalued assets, including A's minor leaguers Nick Swisher and Jeremy Brown, catcher-now-A's-first-baseman Scott Hatteberg and theA's underhand reliever Chad Bradford<br />My one small disagreement lies with the continuing myth that baseball is a monopoly. Major league baseball teams do not compete with one another the way competing firms compete. Rather they work in effect as regional offices of the same firm. Competing firms would be glad to put their opponents out of business; major league baseball would die if that were to be the case. The fact that teams compete on the field disguises the fact that teams are economically cooperating with one another. The teams compete against other uses of the fans' entertainment dollar, not one another. Major league baseball is not a monopoly; it is one big company operating in the entertainment or sports business. Even 'free' agents cost two first-round draft choices, and Beane shows how to put these to good use.<br />Lewis shows, however, that baseball can be rational, a process to be studied, understood and, most important, managed. Good management is essential to success. The A's, contrary to what Bud Selig says, are not an \\"aberration\\". Instead, they benefit from good management. In 2002, their division standings were exactly the opposite of the team payrolls. Management matters more than money. Economic inefficiencies can be ferreted out and exploited. Reliance on conventional wisdom and not on researched, reasoned analysis will produce a lot of expensive losses. Just look at the Orioles, Mets, Red Sox, and Dodgers. And then look at Minnesota, Toronto and Oakland.
B00000IO4J|4.0|A pleasantly enjoyable alien invasion movie which pits the wits of a rapidly-shrinking group of high schoolers against a rapidly-growing group of water-loving alien monsters.<BR>Plot-wise, there's not much new: 'Something's not quite right at school' is the theme that takes up most of the film, with the usual disbelieved teenagers trying to warn their parents of the danger amongst them.<BR>Certain parts of the film are full of holes; the courageous tactic used by the kids to dispose of the aliens seems slightly ridiculous and the usual character mold of the over-sexed, dentally perfect, highschool students being pursued by something evil, puts the film in Clich Land.<BR>However, 'The Faculty' works well through convincing special effects, one or two surprises and the intrigue of not knowing who is human and who is alien. Reminiscent of several better films, such as 'The Thing', it fails in atmospherics but makes up its losses with a very impressive twist near the end.<BR>Look out for a young Josh Hartnett who went on to star in 'Pearl Harbor' and an even younger Elijah Wood, who was to become internationally famous as Frodo Baggins in 'The Lord of The Rings'.<BR>Overall, 'The Faculty' is very watchable; not destined for the Horror Hall of Fame but something which could easily make it to your video shelf, to be watched again and again.<BR>This is a movie for fans of furtive alien takeovers of the 'Body Snatchers' kind.
B00004RF97|4.0|Katherine as Tracy Lord shows a good range of her skills between being a spoiled witch to being a caring loving daughter and wife. Cary Grant and James Stewart are great in supporting roles. Grant is the cynical ex-husband, Dexter Haven, that wants to get even with her by embarrassing her. He is perfect for the part. Stewart is a reporter that falls for Tracy and shows us his ability to make us laugh or cry for him as he did in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;. In fact all the supporting cast is perfect. The sets and music make us feel the surroundings are real and that we are truly there. By letting us get a glance of the wealth in the 30s makes it a great period piece as well. Any fan of Hepburn, Grant, or Stewart will enjoy it.
0783225849|5.0|Even after more than 40 years, and even after having seen it so many times, I am still caught up in the tension which director Hitchcock develops so carefully. I am still shocked by the famous (infamous?) shower scene and by later moments in the Bates residence. It is thus a tribute to Hitchcock, his cast, and crew that this breakthrough retains its shock value after so many years. Hitchcock requires his audience to be especially alert to seemingly insignificant details as well as to playful insertions. More often than not, we are thus aware of what his leading characters miss. The first time around, I spotted him wearing (all things) a cowboy hat but only after several viewings did I spot Ted Knight in a small role as a prison guard. Her adulterous relationship with Sam Loomis (John Gavin) notwithstanding, Janet Leigh (as Marion Crane) was never more attractive than in she is this film. Frankly, I am still trying to wipe from my memory Perkins' portrayal of Jim Pearsall in Fear Strikes Out. It is almost as painful to watch as William Bendix' portrayal of Babe Ruth. In this film, Perkins is brilliant as Norman Bates.<br />Even as I saw this film again, I wanted to warn Norman's victims before it is too late.  Marion, of course, but also Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam). Don't be fooled! He really isn't the nice young man he seems to be! And for God's sake, don't go near the house! Perhaps only Hitchcock could engage and then sustain such emotions, and do so at such a high level of anxiety. That is not the case, at least for me, with The Birds. Oh sure, a few moments which still have some bite (no pun intended) but without the seamless continuity to be found in Psycho.<br />Many think this is a great film, period. I think it is among the greatest of horror films. It redefined the rules for that genre. When first released, it defied so many conventions concerning adultery, nudity, and physical violence. What it suggests is even more frightening than what it portrays visually. Spielberg must have studied this film with great care. With all due respect to several moments in Jaws when, during my first viewing, I literally came up out of my seat in terror, it is the sense of infrequently seen but ever-present danger which captures our attention from the first underwater shot at night (I can still hear the cellos) until almost the very end of the film.<br />I have seen most of the horror films which preceded this one. With only minor deviations, they tend to follow a formula. Even at an early age, I realized that violent thunderstorms with lightning illuminating a castle against the late-night sky, especially with a sound track featuring violin music, indicate that SOMETHING REALLY BAD is about to happen. The moment I became fond of a minor character, I knew that character was doomed. These films were almost completely predictable. The only question is \\"When?\\"<br />Not so with Psycho, at least when viewed for the first time. And as I indicated earlier, Hitchcock still gets me emotionally involved even if by now I almost know the screenplay by heart. How does he accomplish that? I have yet to come up with answer that satisfies me. Meanwhile, I will continue to appreciate his art and especially films of his such as this.<br />Thanks to the DVD format, both image and sound are much clearer. I also appreciate having supplementary materials such as the documentary \\"The making of Psycho\\" featuring new interviews with Janet Leigh, Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hichtcock O'Connell, writer Joseph Stefano and Hilton A. Green; one censored scene; newsreel footage; and the shower scene both with and without music. Excellent stuff!sually. Spielberg must have studied this film with great care.

B00005JLEU|4.0|This visually beautiful, oddball-entertaining animated film is one of Miyazaki's most interesting, although perhaps not his best. The images are so wonderful that the quirks of the plot don't matter. The heroine, a sulky, typically bored preteen named Chihiro, finds herself trapped in the world of the spirits. Her parents have been turned into pigs (because of their greed), and she herself has to take a job working in a bath-house run by the witch Yubaba (whose name means roughly &quot;hot-water old woman&quot;). The bath-house clientele consists of spirits, and it is delightful to see how Miyazaki gave form to them--nature gods and spirits have been around in Japan since ancient, pre-Buddhist times. Chihiro finds the strength of will and character to survive in this confusing world, and becomes more confident and mature during her stay there. With the assistance of a mysterious boy named Haku, she manages to extricate herself and her parents from Yubaba's realm, and helps Haku to throw off Yubaba's control of his memory as well.<br />There is one slightly violent scene, complete with flying drops of blood, but this shouldn't be particularly disturbing to children over the age of 10.<br />This film is highly recommended, for both adults and children of middle-school age and above.
B000089RVX|5.0|I picked this cd up because it had a cool cover...I was looking for something new &amp; the guy at the store suggested it. After listening to this I fell in love with it. The music is not over produced. Instead, it is a refreshing raw edge laced around a powerhouse voice that has a distint sound reminiscent of early Sinead O Conner(The Lion &amp; the Cobra.) Tracks 1-5 standout the most while the rest keeps you interested enough to keep on replay.
B000002IMG|1.0|Testament was often considered one of the second tier of thrash bands, behind the big four of Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax. In the shadow of the big four, the likes of Testament, Exodus, Forbidden, and Overkill struggled to gain the recognition of their more famous peers. But it never came. For the likes of Exodus, it was a travesty. For Testament, it was never going to happen- they simply weren't good enough.<br />Before all the old school thrash fans out there call for my head on a spike so crows can pick my dead staring eyes from their sockets, let me explain. Testament was and is a good band, but never reached beyond that level in the 1980s. The New Order is a good example of why. On first listen, it has all the ingredients of a good thrash album, but a few hours later, you're struggling to remember any of it. Put simply, Testament as a whole were poor songwriters back in the 1980s. The riffing is solid, but unimpressive. Alex Skolnick's leads are adequate, but not dazzling. Chuck Billy's vocals are flat, and poorly executed in places. The song lyrics are standard, middle-of-the-road thrash fare. All seems &quot;good&quot;, but nothing is &quot;great&quot;, so promotion to the major leagues never came.<br />Testament were often unfairly labelled Metallica clones. Unfortunately, many media at the time had no idea about thrash metal beyond Metallica or Slayer, so bands were generally compared to one or the other of them. Testament had their own sound. Listen to &quot;Disciples Of The Watch&quot;, the best song on the album. The bass was audible. The rhythm and lead guitars were quite different to Metallica's sound. And Louis Clemente ran rings around Lars Ulrich when it came to drum technique and skill. Unfortunately, it just did not seem to gel on the rest of the album. It is like tomato sauce, ice cream and beer- all fine on their own, but mixed together? Not appetising at all.<br />This album is probably of interest as a history piece today, but youwould not use it to show someone how good thrash was back in the 80s. It is simply too mediocre for that.
0767817478|4.0|Emmerich and Devlin's take on everybody's favorite radioactive lizard is just fine.  \\"Godzilla\\" kills a little bit of your time and lets you forget about all those bills you owe and how tall that grass is getting outside.  Watch it with a bowl of popcorn and expect the expected:  A huge lizard rampages through the Big Apple and tears up a few boats along the way.  There isn't much else you can do with a \\"Godzilla\\" flick unless you throw in a great villain like Mothra.  I liked the idea of a pregnant \\"Godzilla,\\" but the baby G's resemble the velociraptors a la \\"Jurassic Park\\" too much.<br />Granted, what are the odds that a huge radioactive lizard created by French nuclear tests will decide to pack up and settle in New York City?  While it's in town, it'll stop off at Madison Square Garden and lay a few eggs.  Then, it'll waltz out to the Brooklyn Bridge and let the military waste it. IT'S A MOVIE!!!  That's all.  It doesn't make you anymore aware of the plight of Greenpeace or some other environmental group.  Your won't hate the French anymore than you already do.  That isn't the point of this film.  Emmerich and Devlin made this movie to make you act like Joey Lawrence and say \\"Whoa!\\" when Godzilla pops onto the screen.  They did the same thing in \\"Independence Day.\\"  This movie has no substance or Oscar-winning performances.  What it does is make you say things like \\"Doesn't the mayor look like Roger Ebert?\\" or \\"Man, Godzilla totally punked out those submarines!\\"  It is pure, unadulterated fun and games.  No moral message, no originality, no taste...just a fun movie about one tough lizard.

6304712944|4.0|Reviewers pick on the film's weaknesses, but overall, I think it is winning.  Here are my top disagreements with fellow viewers:<br />1)  Blue eyeshadow.  This adds to the exoticism of the medieval setting, in which courtiers were often dandy types, and strange fashions came and went.<br />2)  Stage cast vs. film cast.  Overall, I'd say the film audience got the best of it.  Most of all, Richard Harris, who campaigned for the part, plays Arthur with such puckish enthusiasm, dramatizing the conflict between the human boy/man and the beloved king.  Famous and drunk, Richard Burton would never have brought so much charm to the role.  (Later Harris became famous and drunk.)  Vanessa Redgrave's ethereal yet sensual charmisma convinces us that she is the fickle queen who dismantled Camelot; Julie Andrews' girl next door quality would never have had the same magic.<br />3)  Franco Nero was no Olivier, but his handsome doll-like appearance and stiffness actually drive the humor home in the hilarious &quot;C'est Moi.&quot;  He comes across as a slick and shallow narcissist, making us feel worse for the all-too-human Arthur.<br />4)  Singing voices.  In most musicals the singing voices are dubbed.  Here they sang as they acted, giving the songs a rough but natural quality.  Harris is a good singer.  Redgrave's voice is delicate but this emphasizes her charm.  Nero?  Oh well.<br />5)  The film could have benefited from some editing.  It does get a little pompous.  The score relies too heavily on the songs, sometimes forecasting them before they have actually been performed, which bugs me.  <br />6)  The highly detailed set is wonderful and has aged well.<br />Humor and sweet, manipulative emotion win the day.  You have to be willing to go along with this film, as its original audience was.

He made me realize that most people are passing up oppurtunities everyday, without even knowing. Most of the things that he said I agreed with. You can tell that his rich dad taught him so much and even his poor dad. His poor dad showed him the life he didnt want to live and he learned from his poor dad's mistakes.He really has a well understanding of what he is talking about. You can tell this by his graphs and his word choice.

B00005ATQI|2.0|I recently watched the two versions of The Shining back to back (Stephen King's version first, followed by Stanley Kubrick's). I understand there are people out there who think that Stanley Kubrick was God's gift to the film world. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them, and I think what Kubrick did to King's magnificent tale is a total shame.<br />Firstly, the adult actors - with the exception, perhaps, of Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers - were all badly cast. Having watched the documentary attached to Kubrick's version, I concede that Shelley Duvall did the best job that she could in trying circumstances, and with what was really a lousy script. But, in the end, she was able to pretty much manage only two emotions through the whole film - paranoia and hysteria.<br />As I said in my review of Stephen King's version, I believe that Jack Nicholson was totally and completely wrong for the role of Jack Torrance. Right from the start, he looked like he'd already lost his mind, and was just waiting for the right moment to take up his axe and go beserk. Nicholson's manic performance completely spoilt any chance of suspense in this film.<br />As for Danny Lloyd, his performance was okay, but for one issue. Whose idea was it for him to pretend that his finger was Tony??? Please, I've seen some moronic things in films, but that made it look like Danny was schizophrenic, not psychic. He was supposed to be able to put himself into a trance-like state, during which Tony would visit him with premonitions of the future.<br />I'm not annoyed that Kubrick's was not 100% true to the story of The Shining. I'm annoyed that the end result was such a flat, emotionless mess. Kubrick did not delve into the human psyche, and there is no deeper horror to this movie. It didn't need special effects, and it didn't even need to stay true to the book. It did need to be able to connect with the viewers on a deeper level, though, and it failed badly in that respect.<br />At no point during the film did I feel any hint of emotion at what was happening. I was totally indifferent, and really couldn't have cared less if Jack had caught Wendy and Danny and chopped them up into little pieces. Heck, I probably would have cheered.<br />Although, I admit I was highly annoyed that the character of Dick Halloran was killed. Out of all the ways that Kubrick diverted from the story, this was probably the most unforgivable transgression. It was supposed to be Dick who got Wendy and Danny out of the Overlook, not simply be there as a convenient target for some long overdue blood-spill.<br />It's no wonder that this film was subjected to such ridicule when it was released, and it's especially no wonder that Stephen King was severely disappointed with it. It was his book that Kubrick effectively trashed. It's just a pity that in the wake of Kubrick's death, everyone seems determined to praise his film up so much more than what it deserves.el any hint of emotion at what was happening.

B000063UR2|3.0|To paraphrase Bilbo Baggins, half of the reviewers who say they really love this film probably only love it half as much as they claim, and the other half who say they hate it probably hate it twice as much as it really deserves. Ridley Scott's mid-80's fantasy adventure is almost unanimously loathed by \\"professional\\" critics, but appears to retain a loyal cult following. In reality, the \\"only\\" thing wrong with \\"Legend\\" is an appallingly bad screenplay seemingly dreamed up by a 13 year old girl from Marin County with posters of Tom Cruise and unicorns all over her wall and parents who love Yanni. Unfortunately, in the context of cinematic art, that's a pretty big \\"only\\" (and begs for an \\"MST3K\\" treatment some day...). The production design and visuals, however, are so sumptious and intoxicating (more so than ever on DVD) that it really does take you to another time and place, although you still wish the inhabitants were given some more intelligent dialogue to chew on. With the exception of an obviously miscast and embarrassed Tom Cruise (watch him actually flinch when the Gump offers up a toast and pronounces him: \\"Fairy Friend!\\"), most of the cast do as well as they can with the material. Tim Curry's Creature of Darkness, which is a wonder to behold (in prosthetics and in performance) remains one of the most truly terrifying \\"demon\\" characters in filmdom (even surpassing the \\"Balrog\\" in the more recent \\"Lord Of The Rings\\"). The inclusion of the original 114-minute \\"European\\" version in the 2-disc DVD edition, along with the more familiar US print, is a nice nod to film buffs and collectors.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Nothing pleases me more than to see a film that is so powerful in it's own way than this. Films like this are the reason I go to Film School. I watched over and over again the orignal version, and this came out, and I was so overwelmed as soon as it opened on the screen that my eyes welled up. <BR> Anyone that doesn't enjoy this film lacks alot of imagination, sequence after sequence of a goosebump creating story just make you want to watch it again and again.<BR> Mixed with an amazing score and Guy Pearce's amazing acting as Alexander Hartdegen, this film is not worth turning away from.
B00008NRLX|5.0|I bought this album upon its release about three months ago and it has been in heavy rotation on the car CD ever since! I loved Tomorrow The Green Grass, but was never able to get into either of the next two albums, despite flashes of brilliance like &quot;I'm Gonna Make You Love Me.&quot; No such problem this time--from the opening cut (&quot;Stumbling Through The Dark&quot;) this one grabbed me and won't let go...&quot;Tailspin&quot;, &quot;Eyes of Sara Jane&quot;, &quot;Save It For A Rainy Day&quot; and, especially, &quot;Angelyne&quot; are just awesome songs; I can't get some of them out of my head for days on end.<br />It's comforting to know that in 2003 there are still bands out there doing this kind of wonderful work. The (hopefully permanent) addition of former Long Ryder and multi-instrumentalist Stephen McCarthy to the group is a big plus as well. Highly recommended.
B0000256KE|5.0|For your Pleasure was Roxy Music at their absolute finest.  More polished than their amazing debut, with Eno virtually taking over on side 2 (vinyl) Brilliant lyrically (Beauty Queen, Editions of You) Distincively British countryside on Strictly Confidential, just plain ecstatic on In Every Dream Home a Heartache.  Sure Do the Strand will go down as the hit song off the album and one of Roxy`s finest ever moments, but there are other stunning moments on this album, Beauty Queen which is a love lorn lament, Grey Lagoons where every member of the band gets to solo out in a very 50`s frenzy and The Bogus Man which is bass heavy and bombastic.  Clearly the finest moment is In Every Dream home a Heartache with its false ending and brilliant solo guitar/synth.  Excellent stuff although Eno`s last Roxy moment.
6302799066|5.0|This Cold War black comedy holds up today because of the madness of war, but also in its exploration of people who make the decisions to go to war, be it the generals or the politicians who have that duty, to paraphrase General Jack D. Ripper's remark on what French premier Georges Clemenceau said regarding war.  Indeed, the president in this movie rightfully says \\"I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolf Hitler!\\"<br />And when it comes to nuclear war, with planes of the SAC on 24 hour standby, all within 200 miles of their designated targets, ready to go when a certain code is issued, and that is a code to a secret plan for all B-52's to deliver their payload, each bomb which contains \\"16 times the total force of all bombs and shells used in World War II\\" the responsibility of generals and politicians cannot be more understressed.  And what if some crazy general named Jack D. Ripper orders the 843rd air division to execute Plan R, R for Robert?  His executive officer, an RAF officer named Captain Lionel Mandrake, member of the Office Exchange Program, tries to dissuade him to no avail.<br />There's way too much precious dialogue, but the president's phone conversation with the Soviet premier is a classic:  \\"... Fine, I can hear you now, Dmitri ... Clear and plain and coming through fine ... I'm coming through fine, too, eh? ... Good, then ... well, then, as you say, we're both coming through fine ... Good. ... Well, it's good that you're fine and ... and I'm fine ... I agree with you, it's great to be fine ...\\"  And that's only part of it.\\"  The president, bald, bespectacled, and intellectual-looking, is clearly based on Adlai Stevenson, runner-up in the 1952 and 1956 presidential election.<br />SAC General Buck Turgidson says on a nuclear retaliation against the Soviets, \\"Now, truth is not always a pleasant thing. But it is necessary now to make a choice, to choose between two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless 'distinguishable', postwar environments: one where you got twenty million people killed, and the other where you got a hundred and fifty million people killed. ... I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks.\\"<br />Major \\"King\\" Kong, leader of the B-52 crew, has a funny speech to the crew when he realizes that they are at \\"nuclear combat toe to toe with the Russkies,\\" but also in listing the contents of the survival kit.<br />Think of what was happening when this movie was released in 1964.  Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.  Khrushchev had been ousted by hardliner Brezhnev.  The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution had been passed.  Yet unjustified communist paranoia was rampant, as evidenced in Ripper's statement:  \\"I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.\\"<br />Peter Sellers has yet another movie in which he plays three roles--the first was The Mouse That Roared.  He is Mandrake, the president, and the title character.  George C. Scott has one of his greatest roles as SAC general Buck Turgidson.  Sterling Hayden really delivers as the insane Jack D. Ripper.  And this was James Earl Jones's debut movie.<br />Funny names abound.  The Soviet premier is called Kissoff, the president is Merkin Muffley, think Jack D. Ripper with Jack The Ripper, and Major Kong's nickname is \\"King\\" so go figure.  Oh, while Merkin sounds like American, look up \\"merkin\\" in a dictionary for a real laugh.  And the exaggerated opening credits, with the small first name and large last name in a real thin font, the phallic resemblance of the fuel plane fuelling the B-52, is yet another comic touch.<br />One of Kubrick's best movies, sticking with an anti-war theme laced with his usual mean-spirited cynicism.  And remember, \\"We'll meet again, one sunny day, till the blue skies wipe the dark clouds away.\\", till the blue skies wipe the dark clouds away.\\"
B00005LC1H|5.0|Now almost 30 years old, this classic comedy series is still holding it's own against today's more contemporary material, and being discovered by a whole new audience. US viewers who may not have been exposed to it, may miss some of the more subtle aspects, but any fans of John Cleese, or more recently Mr Bean, will certainly find it memorable. It is NOT however Monty Python type material, for those expecting more outrageous, and off the wall satire. Basil Fawlty (Cleese) is the owner and operator of a modest seaside Hotel, and is more than ably supported by a great ensemble cast. Ever hen pecked by his domineering wife, often outsmarted, or assisted by his clever maid, and constantly frustrated by his pidgeon English speaking waiter, the results are hilarious, witty and very amusing. Some of the episodes can make the viewer cringe a little (at the frustrating aspects of Cleese's character) but the overall picture is enormously pleasing. If you have never seen Fawlty Towers, you have certianly missed out, and the DVD collection is the best buy, with ALL epsiodes, and some great extra material included. You will laugh, and laugh again at each side splitting episode which manages to be funny, without be overtly sexual, full of innuendo, and reliant on cheap laughs. Great entertainment!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I love it when I pick up an album and I don't know what to expect and then what I hear blows me away.  So far this is the only album that has done that in a couple years(out of the ones by artists I've never heard of before...Radiohead blew me away but I already knew what they were like).  Words really can't describe what this is like but they are completely original and they have such a unique sound.  <br />I can't say I didn't expect this to be good.  Pretty much anything produced by Rick Rubin I end up liking (along with anything produced by Butch Vig...but that's another matter).  I checked out the booklet when I bought it and I happened to notice that Flea plays on the cd.  Ok at this point I was sure this cd couldn't miss.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of my favorite bands and Flea is quite possibly the best bassist in the world.  The artwork is also fantastic (two covers...the one you buy it as and then there is one on the back of the booklet).  All the text and pictures go well with the concept of the album (since it is a concept album).  The titles of the songs and the name of the cd itself is very interesting and fits in nicely.<br />I've read some reviews from amazon and magazines since I bought this that say the sound isn't that accessible.  Well, normaly if that is the case it would require a couple of listens before it grew on me.  This album was great the first time I listened to it.  I also can't really pick out individual songs from the list since you need to listen to the album as a whole.  Each songs is amazing and shifts through so many moods that all I could think of when it got done was \\"wow\\".  Oh, and \\"why is it over?\\"  They also play out each song like it is meant to be and give no regard to song length (the lengths go all over the place)...and that is a definite plus.  Not many bands will do that.  That is why I also like Tool and Pink Floyd so much.  <br />The general sound of the album is really their own...so it is hard to compare itto other bands.  The effects and what not sometimes bring Pink Floyd to mind, but they are definetely not as slow.  The mood swings throughout the songs bring to mind Jane's Addiction (3 days specifically).  All that really doesn't matter because this is really a fine piece of rock that every person should own.  Recommended to absolutely everyone.  Don't miss out because this is going down in music history.  I can't wait to see what they come up with in the future.
B000094A6A|5.0|A very funny movie that was worth the money.Does anyone remember the good old days when rated R stood for violence,language and most important nudity?

B00005JLYU|4.0|I know this movie has gotten pretty bad reviews, but as for myself I enjoyed it very much. If you are expecting a movie that tackles philosophical issues and deep life lessons this is not the one to watch. But it does offer great fight scenes, cool special effects and LOTS OF HUMOR. Not to mention 3 gorgeous ladies kicking [tail]. One person that I need to mention here (what a surprise) is Demi Moore. Great job playing the fallen angel. And man does she look great.  If you accept this film for what it is and watch it without loaded expectations I promise you will enjoy it.
B00005JLK1|4.0|After the opening 5 minutes of this movie I began to fear the worst, as the director seemed to need to rely on images of visual gore, rather than the macabre in grabbing the viewers attention. What follows however is pleasantly suprising, and has a great deal of well directed suspense, and scary moments.<br />A seasoned crew of salvage experts (led by Gabrielle Berne) are approached by a young reporter who claims to have found a missing ocean liner (hinted as a contemporary Mary Celeste) and are immediately interested from a financial standpoint.<br />Once the vessel is found and they are aboard they begin having strange encounters with the ships previous inhabitants (now the Ghosts of the title) and start to rapidly believe they should not have taken the job. The script moves up a notch or two at this point, and really keeps you guessing as to what is going on - one or two &quot;jump&quot; scenes are woven in to the story as it moves towards it's climax and the ending is very cleverly (and unexpectedly)suspenseful, leaving the hairs standing on the back of your neck. Not for everyone, and some of the schlock moments are more than a little graphic, but very polished and well made movie. Enjoy

B000096FUE|5.0|Former member of legendary comic group Monty Python, and providing trend-setting cartoons there, Terry Gilliam became a respected and unique film director, whose track record includes \\"Brazil\\" \\"The Fisher King\\" \\"12 Monkeys\\" and so on.  But at the same time, he was well-known for his tendency to get involved with troubled productions (his fight with Universal over the contents of \\"Brazil\\" is now too famous).  Some say he is a troublemaker, but they should watch this splendid documentary for once because, as the film tells, the truth is different.  <br />Terry Gilliam started the production of \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\\" in Sep. 2000 in Spain.  After ten years of preparation, with the cast like Jean Rochefort (as Don Quixote), Johnny Depp, and Vanessa Paradis, the film was going to be a success.  And director Gilliam looks very happy and optimistic even if he had to make this film as all-European production without the help from Hollywood.  OK, they got this budget as much 40 million dollars.<br />Suddenly things start to look bad.  One major investor bailed out, so the budget went down to $ 32 million.  But still Terry  looks OK, but problems rush to the production team.  No contract done with Vanessa Paradis (hey, but she must be living with Johnny in Paris!  How come...)  No available sound stage excpt one with terrible sound effect like broken karaoke.  Anyway, the shooting starts.<br />Unexpected troubles happen one after another, as if testing the limit of patience of the crew.  Sudden illness, thundering F-16 jets, and hard rain which literally washes out the whole equipment.  And most terrifying event finally arrives -- the visit of investors!  See Terry's face when he meets them.<br />As you know, so far (I hope) the production is abondoned.  If you're interested in Terry Gilliam's works or the complicated process of film production, you must watch this.  I cannot reveal the details of this excellent documentary, but your heart will be gripped by the tragic events which slowly kill   the enthusiasm of the crew, particulrly that of Terry Gilliam.<br />I hope this film will change the bad boy image of Gilliam, which simply isn't true.  He simply wants to shoot a film.  He just want it, and that's all.  And look at the remaining footage (one minute in all) of the abandoned film, which is simply fantastic, promising the great things that should have realized.
B00009ATKS|4.0|It's an obviously ironic title. Mogwai have always specialised in long, melodramatic, noise-fests and spacey, experimental post-rock. Here, they lean more towards the latter, approaching, at some points, sheer aural bliss, as on opener 'Hunted By A Freak' on which a blinding yet simple indie guitar riff expands into layers of beautiful, lush sound. For anyone who thought Belle & Sebastian and Travis were as complex as Scottish indie music got, they need a listen to this. Even a simple instrumental like 'Moses I Amn't' conveys gorgeousness, a spine-tingling cello line leading its minimalist soundscape. Even on the non-instrumental tracks, vocals flit in and out, usually computer-modified, and more of a textural instrument while chiming guitars carry the melody.<br />Sadly, the huge, distorted guitar sound of Stuart Braithwaite is largely absent, so when it enters halfway through the brilliant 'Killing All The Flies' it is a glorious moment. It's soon gone though, so we must turn to album standout 'Ratts of the Capital' which is like Mogwai of old, a guitar-lover's song, seemingly exploring every texture possible on the instrument and flaunting Mogwais art-metal influence; or closer 'Stop Coming To My House', simply an industrial feast of white noise. The balance they provide make 'Happy Songs' up with Mogwai's best, if not quite reaching the towering, 5-star heights of 'Come On Die Young', and probably to be one of the years best, too.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|It's always difficult to bring a masterpiece of writing to the screen, and poetic licence aside, this is a reasonable attempt.<br />Guy Pearce, shows some versatility in the lead role and ultimately learns the message that &quot;Some things Cannot Be Changed&quot; when he becomes locked away and obsessed with creating the machine of the title, after the murder of his true love, in a bungled mugging incident. The Victorian back drop is quite faithfully and believably recreated, and the acting performances on the whole are well directed. Sadly however, the script seems to have felt the need to deviate so widely from the original story (one assumes to embrace a more modern view) that it tests even the most implausible aspects of the science fiction genre. The SfX are well integrated, and this is by no means a BAD movie - but one feels that a more faithful following of HG Well's ideas, (however dated) would have resulted in a better picture. I wanted to give more, but 3 stars is really the limit.
6304711891|5.0|If you're looking for a great action flick that will hold your attention from beginning to end then you definately have to see this one! Seaqn Connery and Nicholas Cage definately outdo themselves in this one! The characters are unique and compelling, the chemistry between them is just wonderful. They keep you glued to your seat waiting to see what is going to transpire between them next. This one is definately worth buying.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Loved \\"The Matrix\\" and more than a little disappointed by \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\"?  Then check out THE ANIMATRIX.  This superb, eye-popping and mind-engaging anthology of nine short animated films fleshes out background info and parallel stories that make much clearer just how the human-created machine world was able to subjugate the human race.<br /><br />These visionary, stylized films were commissioned by Matrix writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski and feature seven of the best anime artist from Japan, America and Korea.  My favorites: The photo-realistic (CGI) \\"Final Flight of the Osiris I\\" and the hand-drawn \\"The Second Renaissance Parts I & II.\\"  Not for little kids.  Recommended.

B000002J09|5.0|This is one of the only perfect albums ever made. A couple others are The Who's Quadrophenia, The Smiths' debut album, and Pink Floyd's The Wall. Still, this particular Led Zeppelin album practically outranks all others. I do not dislike a single track. My personal favorites make up most of the album: \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"The Battle of Evermore,\\" \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" \\"Going to California,\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" Lyrically and musically, this album is a gorgeous and powerful demonstration of all the qualities that make Led Zeppelin superior to many bands of their time.
B000099T2L|1.0|I thought that the album was, at best, mediocre.  All of the songs sound the same, and it sounds like Beyonce's screaming/wailing throughout the album.  The only song that's worth mentioning is \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" with Luther Vandross.  Don't get me wrong, Beyonce has a good voice, but doing the solo album bit is not for her.  Her music sounded a WHOLE lot better when she was with D.C.  The only reason why she's sold so many albums so far is because of all of the marketing/promoting that they're doing for it.  In a month or two, all of the \\"hype\\" should be over, and her CD will probably end up in a discount bin.
B00005JLT5|4.0|If ever a director was born to make a specific film, it's Roman Polanski and THE PIANIST.  Winner of numerous international awards including Oscars© for Best Picture and Best Director, &quot;The Pianist&quot; follows the true story of Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous escape from the Warsaw Ghetto.  Epic in scope with attention to the minutest period details, the film's authenticity resonates long after it ends. Adrien Brody underplays Szpilman and we understand that his desire to again create music helped him survive. Perhaps the poets had it right when they merged Beauty and Truth and Freedom.  A significant extra is the documentary &quot;A Story of Survival&quot; in which Polanski reflects on his own horrific childhood in the Warsaw Ghetto. Clearly, every frame of &quot;The Pianist&quot; is filtered through that lens.  This is a great film of horror and hope.
0345413377|5.0|So much of the first and second book foreshadowed the third book, so if Philip Pullman did not pull it off right, then he would have made a real let down of a closure.  However, with his great writing skills and able storytelling, he keeps the reader's rapt attention.  This book does not have to introduce any major new character from the beginning, so the action just runs throughout the whole story and takes you right along with it.  I was amazed at the connection that I felt with the characters, but especially near the last moments of the book.  I really love books when I feel I can relate to them, and this book has something for everyone to connect to.  It is one, if not the best ending book of a trilogy, I am pretty sure he is not writing another, that I know of.  I highly recommend this whole series.  However, if you have read the second I can only say this.  Read on, read on.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Black Eyed Peas brought real Hip-Hop with a twist of Funk/Soul in Elephunk album. <BR>The songs that really stick out are Where Is The Love which has ability to make you think and vibe at the same time, Get Retarded lyrically juiced party track, Fly Away and The Apl Song. The Peas delivery complicated lyrics over smooth production, which creates a clean sound of music in an era where garbage fills Hip-Hop. A few songs could be made a little stronger like Anxiety, Latin Girls (Which is still catchy) but where they lack the slack is picked up in The Boogie That Be and Smells Like Funk.  <BR>BEP like The Roots are making music while other groups in Hip-Hop are re-working formulas for financial success, nothing more.
014028009X|5.0|I saw the movie first and thought it was a charming little romantic comedy. Then I ran accross the book in my local library and thought what the heck. Honestly I didn't expect anything different from the movie, but This book was great! the day-by-day play of the life of a singleton who is not always 100% confident but always verbally brilliant was very amusing and releiving. It's kind of nice knowing that I'm not the only one who can say the absolute wrong thing at the worst time. Bridget is wonderful!
B00005K9LK|5.0|Just in case you have been locked away since Hendrix walked the planet, Judas Priest is without any doubt the greatest Metal band of all time. This album merely continues to ascert itself as another chapter of excellence from the Metal Gods. I am so glad Rob is coming back to Priest as I always thought it was a bad idea to replace him with a singer from a cover Priest band, as that isn't the way it should have been done. This band with Rob has given me some of the best moments of my life, I will always be grateful for the majestic \\"Power of the Priest\\"!!!! Buy this album, as you will never regret it!!
B000002J03|4.0|Dated covers, songs inspired by &quot;the lord of the rings&quot; and mock Blues songs where Plant pretends to be an african-american from the masters of hard rock. A classic, but growing very dated as the years ware on.
B00005JLEU|4.0|After dealing with my little brother's obsession with the Pokemon TV show and movies, as well as the Yugioh TV show, I had worked up a pretty thorough dislike of Japanese anime.<br />But when my brother got sick and had already watched several hours of meaningless cartoons, I thought he should at least watch a movie, even if it was anime. And, kind, devoted sister that I am, I watched with him.<br />Well, to say the least I was surprised. Although a little slow to capture my interest, Spirited Away proved to be interesting and unique. The main character was likable and interesting, and we watched as she matured from a scared little girl ( her entire dialogue throughout the first 20 minutes of the film is basically &quot;whine&quot; &quot;whimper&quot; and &quot;exclaim!&quot;) to a brave, mature little girl. Another plus was that Spirited Away didn't have the classic Disney ending, and in fact I thought the ending was bittersweet, something that doesn't often happen in children's movies.<br />A unique plot, if not an especially well-developed one, and good supporting characters (especially Haku) help set this movie above other anime.
B00006BTCA|2.0|Sure the songs are well written, but nothing we haven't heard before.  I think if I could just pull the lead singer out, I would dig on this more.  He is just so damn monotone and drab, he adds nothing to the music.  Put a harmonious chick voice in there with more range and then we're talking.
B000000OYQ|1.0|This was the first album put out by page in which he was not a member of a band, a duo or doing Soundtrack work for  a film. Which is sad given that this was his solo last album and he is capable of so much more. I only hope for him that he puts out an instrumental album sometime, because the instrumental tracks from this album (like \\"emerald eyes\\") are especially moving. Howver, one eases into the conclusion that \\"emerald eyes\\" is probably just another machismo song about trying to seduce women. The 80s cheese hair-metal and generic blues in the actual songs don't work for me here. What is with Page's judgement when hires people to sing on his albums? Is he that bad of a lyricist, that everything is about machismo or depression? \\"prison blues\\" is typical of the depressing entries here...I patiently accept it b/c he played a live version at the 1995 rock n'roll hall-of-fame induction dinner for led zeppelin' that I enjoyed. \\"The only one\\" is like a test run for the Page&Plant reunion of the 1990's. Most of the work is uninspired and the singers&lyrics are so cliche that they make Paul Rodgers (from Page's band 'The Firm') sound like Marvin Gaye...with the possible exception of Plant. Which brings me to the question of why chose Plant? After all, the assumption is that Page's goal for a solo album would be to distance himself from his most high profile band (LZ). By that logic Paul Rodgers should be a vocalist, as well as Roy Harper. In fact, if page were to include a vocalist on a solo work  at all it would make sense to have all great vocalists that he's worked with throughout his career- so it doesn't appear as if he were making a zepp or Badcompany or Roy Harper record, just my opinion, he really needs to make a record that showcases his talents with minimal input from anyone but himself. He is capable of producing and playing every guitar in the studio...he may need a vocalist, a drummer, and a touring band, but he surely doesn't need a studio hack band.
B000002WYT|5.0|As one of those [people] who owns every CD put out by the Dave Matthews Band, I have to say that Crash is easily one of my favorites. IT was the first one I got, and even though I sold it to someone else then (the shame!) when i suddenly came back to my DMB senses, it took back it's place as a favorite. The first track, \\"So Much to Say\\" sets the tone for hte rest of the CD. Truly a great road-trip CD. And supposedly it was ranked as the best make-out CD of all time... but I wouldn't know, honestly! :-)
B000002JK4|4.0|Maybe \\"thru with the two step\\" [isn't great], but the album is fairly consistently good. It really isn't as bad as one would think judging by some of the things he would release in the future like \\"walking into clarksdale\\" and \\"Now and Zen.\\" This was really a fair attempt to move forward for Plant and for the most part it WORKED. It isn't Led Zeppelin , but it is good and interesting if you like the softer side of Zepp- this really isn't too much an eighties sound for Plant, YET, Plant slowly lets go of the 70s here. Good if your interested in the careers of Led Zeppelin after the split, and entertaining in a mellow way not rocking at all.
B00008VGK0|1.0|Having been a fan of Madonna for many years, she has truly hit a a final rock-bottom with her new album and these pathetic remixes of her unimpressive title track.  Not only does the original song leave much to be deserved, she's now allowing them to be remixed by the some of the most bland remixers in the business: Club 69's synth-porn-background-music DJ Peter Rauhofer and Paul Oakenfold.  What happened to Hex Hector and Johnathan Peters?  Jr. Vasquez was her best remixer ever.  Madonna is not representative of an American Life in the slightest bit as she panders the Europeans and pretentious crowd in London.  She sounds whiney, raps horribly, and contradicts herself to no end.  Her sober seriousness in laughable and I'd like to see what she will be up to next time ...
B000001FS3|5.0|One word... Wow. U2 is definitely, and without a doubt, one of the greatest bands of our time. The songs on this album are so simple, yet effectively mindblowing. The pure, easily recognizible U2 sound is complemented by Bono's equally familiar and incredible vocals. <br />ahhhhhh<br />Did I say I love this band?<br />The Joshua Tree is a classic album, and I think everyone should own a copy of it. Done and done.
B00008NRI8|1.0|I usually love Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, but unfortunately this movie is really bad.  Neither character was very appealing, there was no chemistry, and the whole thing was flat.  I found myself actually wincing for the actors.  Do not waste your time.
0783226128|5.0|PACINO AT HIS BEST 10 TIMES BETTER THAN THE GODFATHER
B000092ZYX|5.0|It seems that in the music world, your first impression of a band is usually your favorite impression. For example, I started listening to Pearl Jam when Vs. came out, I somehow hadn't heard Ten (I was really young), and that became my favorite Pearl Jam album. Most people I talk to seem to prefer Ten over other Pearl Jam albums. It's just like that.<br />Everyone gives OK Computer credit for making Radiohead so great, so coincidentally most reviews on here were hoping for OK Computer to return again, and they are somewhat disappointed. I am not one of those people.<br />Personally, I don't think Radiohead have ever been better than this. This is like the sum total of all Radiohead so far. It combines all eras, even having some Bends/Pablo Honey moments, and it's freaking incredible.<br />When I first heard this album, I was in a room with good speakers, the lights off, and cranked it and I was blown away. Every single song is amazing, and the band sounds like they're having a really good time making this. Yorke's voice has never sounded better, and his backup vocals are incredible.<br />I think this album will truly stand the test of time. Anyone who  didn't see them on their 2001 tour might not quite understand yet why this album is so great, but even if you're not so impressed at first, this album will grown on you.
0385720920|5.0|This book is so in depth. Chuck Palahniuk is great at writing literature that goes deep into the pysche. You can be from a family the resembles the Waltons and when you finish this book you feel like you were the little boy standing in the snow while your convict mom made an outline.  I really enjoyed this book and invisible monsters and i look forward to reading all his others.
B00000F14B|5.0|I Absolutely Love this movie.  While Prof. Hill entrances the town he also entrances his audience.  The story is light but fast paced and trully a pleasure to follow.  I'm not going to ruin the movie for you by telling you every detail, rather I do think if you like classic musicals and/or good fun movies, this is a must have.  <br />The DVD is also chalked full of little extras.  I found the special about the making of the film to be quite enjoyable.  I'm always a sucker for the actors bio's and this one is chalked full of em.  I could say alot more I'm sure but I'd rather you checked this one out for yourself.  This is such a great movie.
B000002TYX|1.0|To put it as plainly and as honestly as possible---Beatles Anthology 1 stinks. If this ratings page allowed for it, I would have rated this CD in negative numbers. You know, when I first heard these recordings, I gave the Beatles the benefit of the doubt. I said to myself, &quot;Well, the songs are terrible---out of tune, out of tempo, voices are out of harmony, etc... but, the Beatles  were only kids at the time.&quot; Then I realized that the Beatles were eighteen and nineteen years old when these records were cut---not that young to justify such horrendous musicianship and and such juvenile, discordant singing. I'm not Andre Segovia, but when I was fourteen I was playing a better, crisper, cleaner guitar than were the Beatles at eighteen and nineteen (in Lennon's and Starr's case, at twenty-one and twenty-two). These guys were just plain horrible. As I got older and listened to great guitarists like Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian, Eddie Lang, Joe Pass, etc., and such great drummers as Louis Belson, Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, etc., I realized more and more just how overrated the Beatles were. If not for Brian Epstein's public relations genius and, subsequently, millions of screaming thirteen year old girls, the Beatles would have been just another novelty act warranting an asterisk in popular musical history. Instead, we have an entire 1960s generation (three quarters of whom were stoned out of their minds at the time) hailing these three chord wonders as the collective Jesus Christ of popular music. After listening to these simple-minded, horribly-played and atrociously sung songs, I harbor little doubt that all aesthetic taste in American culture died in the late 1960s. Even worse, the Beatles &quot;democratized&quot; popular music so that from the mid-1960s onward any nitwit who could play a C, F, and G chord on a guitar could become a &quot;musical genius.&quot; And to think these guys became multimillionaires! Of course, we'll get those pseudo-intellectualswho'll claim that the Beatles sophisticated themselves and progressed in their musicianship and went on eventually to write such &quot;classics&quot; as &quot;I Am the Walrus,&quot; &quot;We All Live In A Yellow Submarine,&quot; &quot;Revolution Number 9&quot;, and &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey.&quot; I rest my case.
B000002MG1|4.0|This is the first time i decided to pick an REM album up only hearing the extremely popular everybody hurts to be honest i didnt excpect this band to be all that good and i could not have been more wrong. My favourite tracks are find the river, everybody hurts, try not to breathe and the sidewinder sleeps tonite, it's an album thats full of great sounding acoustic guitar with a little electric to make this a great album from a good band. With this band being in the pop mainstream it's good to hear some well gathered musicianship that works well unlike most you hear in the mainstream.
0151003084|3.0|This book was my first foray into the wierd Victorian-styled blackly-comedic world of Edward Gorey, and definitely got me hooked.  It provides an alphabetical list, in rhyming couplets, of children dying from freak accidents, parental neglect, or their own foolishness (\\"L is for Leo who swallowed some tacks,\\" f'rinstance).  It pokes fun at the Victorian era's placing children on a pedestal by pointing out how easy it is for them to fall and possibly asks, through the absence of parents in any of the illustrations, why did people who held children in such high regard leave theirs in big creepy houses full of potential death-traps?  <BR>I give it a 3 because, while silly, it's not the best example of Gorey's quirky humor.  If you'd like quirky humor and wierd art without dying children, I highly reccomend The Doubtful Guest or The Epipleptic Bicycle
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is one of the few Madonna albums that I own, and there's not a day that goes by that I don't listen to it.  Of course, this contains the big hits like Erotica, Secret, The Power of Good-bye, Frozen, Take a Bow, Ray of Light, Don't Tell Me, and Music.  But to tell you the truth, even though all of those songs are fantastic, Madonna's breathtaking performance of Don't Cry for Me Argentina is the only song that is worth every single penny of this CD's purchase price!  Her voice, which sounds absolutely loveable and airy, combined with the spectacular music backing her up makes this particular track a complete masterpiece.  Bedtime Story (Edit) and Beautiful Stranger (William Orbit Radio Edit), however, are pathetic productions that should have never been Madonna tracks in the first place though, much less made their way onto a Greatest Hits compilation.  The best music is of course the one from the Ray of Light album, my personal favorites being The Power of Good-Bye and Drowned World/Substitute for Love.  And the 7\\" edit of Deeper and Deeper is fantastic, featuring Spanish tango/guitar production towards the end.  But as I said before, the best song on here is the brilliant Don't Cry for Me Argentina.  Madonna claims her position as an artist capable of extraordinary achievements on this track.  Purchase this compilation, you WON'T be sorry!
6305169187|5.0|Cheesy? Ok, yes. And I'm the biggest Armageddon fan out there, I'm sure. Is it still my favorite movie? Without a doubt! I'm pretty cynical when it comes to movies, too. I give this movie a 5 because it has all aspects that I love in a movie: action, stars, love and a teary patriotic ending. I agree that Pearl Harbor looks a little TOO similar to Armageddon, especially the end. The girls are practically wearing the same dresses! <br />Yes, I'm sure there are a lot of bloopers, mistakes and aspects that are totally unbelievable, if not disbelievable, but I don't care. I didn't first watch the movie to look for mistakes, or look into my NASA handbook to make sure that everything was to code. I was entertained, and am still entertained even after having watched it dozens and dozens of times.<br />I will admit to anyone who asks that this is my all-time favorite movie.
B0000039QA|5.0|Im a PAC fan but this is just big to tha fullest. Ne one giving this album lower then 5 is wack. The production could be better but...............this should still be given 7 outta 5.<BR>IF you dont have this............go listen to opera.
0790731894|5.0|This is a great movie. It kinda reminds u of air force one another great movie.  Kurt Russell is a great actor and shows it in this movie. A great storyline and i would recomend this movie to anyone.  The R rating is unnecessary though and i think that any person at least 9 and older could watch it.  It is only R really because of the one scene w/the suicide bomber and then a few swears here and there. And is  somewhat violent but no worse than say The Fast and the Furious, which is another great movie. And theres  not really alot of f-bombs-1 or 2.  This is once again a great plane movie.  Everyone should see this movie.
B00005N83M|2.0|I bet half of yous only gave it soo high because you like her. Im a fan ( not a big fan) of jennifer lopez. But there are some really dope and alot of really wack tunes and songs here.<BR>dont get it unless you are one of those never ending fans of hers
B0000797IO|1.0|i found this movie to be quite pointless. it was also boring without a meaning to what was ocurring.although i love jennifer aniston in &quot;friends&quot;, i think she made a horrible performance in this movie.
B000088E6D|5.0|I first saw Michael Buble' showcased on CBS's Sunday Morning news program.  I heard him first and thought I was hearing Jack Jones Jr.  I thought &quot;excellent I didn't know he was recording!&quot;.  Then this very young man was on the screen.  I looked for his CD that day.  I couldn't find it for a while.  I have enjoyed it multiple times in my car, at work, anywhere I can put my cd in a player.  He's similar to a lot of the crooners but yet he is only himself.  I am excited to be seeing him here in Minneapolis in just a couple of days.  Amazing talent! Can't wait for the next cd!  Thank you Michael!
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I was so excited because I expected Tool to be a normal, but awsome new rock band with mostly just 4 minute songs. I knew very little about the band, but I heard \\"Schism\\" on the radio. That song impressed me, but when I heard the rest of the album, I was extremely dissapointed. A friend of mine let me have a burnt version of Aenima, and I then thought that Tool's songs were far too long and abnormal. Tool was not the new rock band I expected to hear. At the time, I was into bands like Staind and Green Day. One day it hit me... I realized that Tool was unique, creative, and talented, not just any overplayed new rock band.As I listened to their music more and more, I started to like these 8 minute songs that combine with other tracks to form 21 minute combos. As I developed into even more of a \\"Tool Freak\\", I started to hate all of these new rock bands who play similar drum beats throughout whole songs. If you are already a tool fan or a fan of Alice in Chains, or Metallica's slow down stage (Load or Reload) then you are very likeable to develope into a Toolfan...but don't expect normal new rock that you hear on everyday radio (Such as Chevelle, or Trapt). Expect a very different experience that you would never expect unless you already like tool. Some tracks might be 1 minute long, and some go up to 11 minutes long. Give this band a chance, and understand that with difference comes creativity. The band is very tallented too, especially there drummer: Danny Carey. Now I have every tool CD, and I am through with all these no tallent new rock bands. The grinding and pounding in songs such as \\"The Grudge\\" or \\"Ticks and Leaches\\" is impressive and somehow it all fits in with the more soothing slow songs such as \\"Dispostion\\" and \\"Reflection\\". I find it very possible that this band was musically inspired by Pink Floyd.
0312983867|5.0|The 8th book in the Stephanie Plum series is another gem from writer, Janet Evanovich.  Fans of the series could not wait to get their hands on this release, and new readers will be delighted at the antics of the characters in these books.  In this installment, Stephanie's mother asks her to find a neighbor's missing relative, and family loyalty (and boredom) spurs Stephanie to take on the case.  However, when she gets involved, a shady landlord starts warning her off the scent, and suddenly Stephanie finds out his henchman are following her.  When various bad things start to happen, (i.e. her car gets blown up again, she is followed by someone in a bunny suit, snakes wind up in her apartment, and a dead body appears on her couch) Stephanie knows she is in way too deep.  She enlists the help of the sexy Ranger to help her out of this jam, and also finds herself with help from both Grandma Mazur and Lula.  All of the favorite characters from previous installments return, and their antics will have you laughing aloud.<br />I cannot believe that there are people who actually have not read this series!  Stephanie Plum is a hilarious character, and her slapstick comedy has made me laugh aloud at some strange times.  If I read these books in front of other people, they invariably ask me what is so funny, and I can never quite relate the story as well as Ms. Evanovich can!  There are few mystery books that can make me laugh as much as this series and yet keep me interested in the mystery, but this series does it all.  Who else but Stephanie Plum can have every car she has ever owned wrecked in some way (they usually blow up), and be chased by a person in a bunny suit?  If you have never read any of the books in the series, join the millions of others that have and get reading today!<br />The first book in the series is \\"One for the Money\\".  Enjoy!<br />A Cozy Lover
B00005JL7Q|5.0|While agreeing with a previous commentator's thumbs-up, I respectfully object to describing Marcus as &quot;a little boy&quot;.  In my book, an 8-year-old might be &quot;a little boy.&quot;  Marcus, however, is a strapping twelve on the cusp of adolescence.  He even acquires a girl friend before the credits roll.  <br />This insulting dismissal denies Marcus the sober wisdom and coping skills that he demonstrates, and teaches, in the story.  Life has placed him in rather enenviable circumstances, but in many ways he &quot;has it together&quot; better than any other character in the film.  Furthermore, while life inside a wall of estrogen might be tolerable for &quot;a little boy,&quot; Marcus is decidedly too old for such imprisonment and needs to break out.   If a habit of condescension towards kids, or whatever else, prevents a viewer from grasping either of these points, it is unfortunate.  <br />This admiration shows even more clearly in the book.  I love this film, but now that I have read the novel, I like it even more and would urge everyone who rated this movie high that they owe it to the source of the whole concept to read what he produced.  You won't regret it.  Although Marcus is somewhat more assertive and occasionally hard-edged in the original, it is by and large a sustained paean to this young man's ethics, good sense and unerring Menschenkeit.<br />I am generally chary of criticizing films based on novels for not representing them more literally, and far be it from me to downgrade the film from five stars-- but in retrospect, one can see that the events leading up to the ending constitute the weakest section.  They are rather manipulative and incredible and (in the case of Marcus's flouncing out of Will's apartment in a huff) false to his character.  (In the book, he does no such thing, although the dialogue provoking it is in place.  He and Will know each other too well by then.)  This plot development is entirely the film-maker's idea, and it replaces a denouement in the book that is much richer, tying up loose ends and involving a few characters that had been left with merely ornamental roles in the film (especially Marcus's father and his very eccentric girl friend).  One has to wonder why the movie didn't go with it.  Its complexities might have required a few more minutes of screen time, but I for one would not have minded at all, because the rest of it is so great, and so is the novel.
B000006ZKY|5.0|Bonfire is not a very popular rock as their contemporary German band Scorpions. However, with just one mega album they have won the hearts and ears of the rock community. Excellent melodies in this album, Fireworks. Indeed this album is a fire work of this rockers.<br />On the harder side Ready 4 Reaction, American Night and Sleeping All Alone score well. Give it a try and You Make Me Feel are excellent ballads.  <br />In all this is an album which every rock lover would love to have. If you have not listened to the track try one today!<br />KK /:^)
B000002H97|3.0|Although there are some great tracks on this album (Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters) the truth is that majority of the tracks feature very basic guitar riffs, cliche tempo changes and unintriguing drumming. The album on a whole is less than impressive.<br />If you like mainstream music which is dumbed down for the masses, I recommend this album. <br />However, if you appreciate music which is heavy yet beautiful, powerful yet artistic, I recommend you listen to Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets instead of this.
B000002HMH|5.0|All I know is that RELOAD is absolutely one of the best cd's they have done.  I have a really hard time trying to define Metallica's best cd.  I, myself, enjoy every last one of 'em.And for those whom are a little hard on this album, when you make a better one, we'll talk.  This cd is super sexy and worth all your hard-earned pennies.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is simply one of the finest metal albums ever produced. It is heavy, fast, dark, scary, sad, poetic and powerful all at the same time. Ride the Lightning is definately several steps up from Metallica's first album, Kill 'em All. The songs are well balanced, the guitars riffs are phenomenal and catchy and the drums are fast and original. The vocals are nowhere near, say, Pink Floyd or Tool, but they are still quite good... emotional, angry, eerie.<br />The stand out tracks are: <br />Ride the Lightning (9/10)<BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls (8.5/10)<BR>Fade to Black (9.2/10)<BR>Creeping Death (8/10)<BR>The Call of Ktulu (9.8/10) (quite possibly the richest and most original heavy metal song ever) <br />If you like heavy metal, buy this album. You will not be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This woman is not only stunning to look at, but stunning to listen to.  Is it jazz, is it folk, is it pop, is it easy-listening?  Let's just call it an earful of each, mixed together majestically.  Her music is soulful, flowing, and mercifully not oversweet...just right!  There's not a weak track on the entire album.
0767853636|5.0|I was compelled to write a review after reading the bad ones, these people do NOT know what they are talking about.   This movie, so wonderfully choreographed by Arlene Phillips (Austin Powers)is so much fun.  Carole Burnett is hysterical as Ms. Hannigan, Aileen Quinn (annie) is precious and whoever wrote (never to do anything again) was WRONG.  She took time off, by choice, not everyone wants to be Britney, and is now a lead role in Saturday Night Fever.  Ann R. is just such a beautiful dancer and watching, \\"We've got Annie\\" she is just so great, lets see Daddy Warbucks is great, it encompasses a little history with the Pres. R's New Deal and helps kids to understand the depression.  Bernadette P and Carol are great together in \\"easy street\\" - the orphans choreography with back flips on the beds and leaps in \\"hard knock life\\" are so much fun.  This is good, clean, wholesome movie watching.  My daughter and I have so much fun watching it.   I hate when stupid critics pan  things because it doesn't have 50 explosions per minute and sex as the punch line of all the jokes.   I can't say enough about how much fun this movie is.
B000002BYD|4.0|Another year, another overlooked Pearl Jam album.  Even I can be considered guilty of it, having not purchased an album of theirs since this one.  It's a shame, however, since while this showcased them at top form, few people realized they were still making incredible music, especially after the (unwarranted) backlash against No Code, which I believe holds the top spot as most overlooked PJ album.<br />Nevertheless, this is a treasure everyone should give a chance.  It's suprising it didn't do better, as most of it was a return to more direct, tightly-crafted melodies ala Ten or Vs.  &quot;Brain of J&quot; and &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; are both power-punk masterpieces.  &quot;Wishlist&quot; is possibly the most beautiful (the only?) love song they've ever done, with Vedder's yearning coming across earnestly and touchingly.  &quot;In Hiding&quot; is the closest to an epic on this record, yet it still manages to satisfy with soaring vocal melodies and ringing guitar work. The record's a bit short and underwhelming considered next to their earlier efforts, but is crafted so magnificently that it's hard to notice or care. All proof that though unappreciated and under the radar, PJ continues to impress if given a chance.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Linkin Park's new album, &quot;Meteora,&quot; is alike in many ways to the first one.  Not to say that this CD is terrible, but the album is nothing revolutionary.  It's just more of the same. There are some catchy songs on the album though and they're good enough to keep you listening for a bit.  After a while though, it really starts to grow out on you and then you figure, why did I buy this album?  Actually, that's just me, but if you're going to buy it, thinking this album will be as good as the first one, forget about it.  Many of the songs sounds simliar to the first one.  One of them sounds just like &quot;A Place For My Head.&quot;  I tried sining the chorus from that song into one of the songs from the new one, and it actually went!  The same notes were on that same song as well.  Would I reccommend it?  Sure, why not.  If you're into this type of music, you'll definitely like it.  I just expected a lot more from it, but I was a bit disappointed.
B00006CXXU|3.0|After hearing the song &quot;Dirty&quot;, I thought, &quot;My God, her music is now as bad as her image is&quot;.  But then, she released &quot;Beautiful&quot;.  I had to get the album then because I was confused.<br />Well, I bought the album and it's fair.  Half the songs she stepped way out of her element and really doesn't even showcase her beautiful voice at all.  Her voice is wasted on most of this album, which is a shame.<br />To me, it seemed like she wanted to make a statement with this album that she is a free person and won't let anything anyone says get to her.  Ok, fine.  I understand she wants to take a stand.  But the album suffered because of it.<br />Christina is her own person, and she can indeed do whatever she wants.  But at this point in her life, it's sad to see how she's disgraced herself.  I don't know what kind of issues she's dealing with internally, but I hope she gets it all straightened out and can one day be content with her place in the world.  Right now, she's very confused.  It shows on this album.
B00005JKDR|5.0|As a young person, I (allong with many others) could never sleep with my closet door open.  Well now I know the reason.<br />Monsters, Inc. has the quality of a kids cartoon that adults dearly need.  It has the limited &quot;adult&quot; humor (such as Mike forgetting his anaversary) that makes the adult happy that the movie is not &quot;Blues Clues&quot; or Barney.<br />The computer animation is perfect, especially in an extra on the DVD entitled Mike's New Car.  Additionally, the other extras on the DVD are worth it, including how they made the fur on the monsters look real, to the creation of a monster world.<br />Finaly, the two main characters make a great pair, so much so that you may even feel like calling our best friend after watching this movie just to say hello.
B00005JLPK|5.0|&quot;I'd rather have an intelligent enemy than a stupid friend&quot;<BR>The story of the love between Diego and Frida alone makes this a great movie, along with a glimpse of the political climate of that period. What was great about their love for each other, was that it was based on true camaraderie, fully knowing each others faults beforehand.<BR>After their second marriage, when Frida was bedridden and wanted to go to the opening of her show but was forbidden to get out of bed, the speech Diego was giving about Frida , was a great testimonial to their love....and the manner in which she shows up without disobeying doctors orders is GREAT!<br />I only wish that Remedios Varo would have made it into the movie. I would also like to see a movie on her life and her circle of surrealist and political friends.
B000001IQH|5.0|The writer for the editorial review had better check their information about Rancid's origin.<BR>   This is one of the most complete, hardhitting and thoughtful albums I own. Each song has  its own catchiness without sounding like a pop hit. Rancid is alway compared to my lifetime favorite band the Clash. Maybe there is some subliminal recognition for me but I see very few resemblances. What I do hear is a lot of California (Northern) punk sometimes mixed with ska and reggae. I will compare it to The Clash's London Calling because it is so full of good stuff. Sorry Joe but Out Come The Wolves is better, in a sense, because it doesn't have a couple cheesey songs like Lost in a Supermarket and Train in Vain. If you like punk with a story and a conscience buy this one.<BR>Buy it, it's a guarantee. Then go out and buy Operation Ivy.
B000002LRX|5.0|Faith No More, Angel Dust (Slash/Reprise, 1992)<br />Angel Dust, almost universally panned upon its 1992 release, has paid back its critics in spades recently by being named the most influential album of all time by Kerrang! magazine. Patton's finest FNM-era lyrics combine with the band's heaviest work ever to create an (no pun intended) epic of hysteria. From the quiet \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" to the cheerleader-esque \\"Be Aggressive\\" to the Steinbeck-inspired \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" and every possible space in between. Thirteen of the most glorious rock and roll tunes ever recorded.<br />That said, the album's highlight, and one of Patton's greatest lyrical triumphs (along with King for a Day's \\"Evidence\\") during the FNM years, is \\"Kindergarten.\\" The song doesn't get enough press when this album is discussed because it lacks the extremity of \\"Jizzlobber,\\" the popularity of \\"Midlife Crisis,\\" or the experimental qualities of \\"RV.\\" Nevertheless, it is a perfect example of what it is meant to be-a catchy, easy to follow rock/metal song. Patton manages to blend the wistful, the despairing, the impressionist, the nostalgic, and the angry into one song with complete aplomb. FNM may be considered the progenitors of the current rap-metal movement dominating the airwaves, but if any of the bands involved in it have written a song this good, I haven't heard it yet.<br />Angel Dust is not an essential metal album, it is THE essential metal album. One of the finest releases of the 1990s. *****
B00005JL9B|5.0|The story is similiar to Lord of the Flies in some ways but done quite a bit better.  Every year a random class is brought to this island to compete in the Battle Royale.  Apparantly the youth of today is very disrespectful towards the adults so this is the solution.  It's amazing how in a film you can get a feel for all the students and how their lives are and were before they found themselves on this island.  The book itself a piece of work and I highly recommend you read the book as well.  It'll be well worth it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I happen to think tatu is a very successful pop duo. and no they arnt shown on covers ov teen mags over and over like Britney or Avril, but isnt it refreshing for a change to have some thing not bubble gum related? glitter and blond streaks are only substantial fo a short time. maybe they arnt lesbien but in this day and age why should it matter? it should be about the music not the image and that is what people are forgetting these days.Tatu gives 2 very important messages be yourself and you are not alone.I think people dont give them enough credit and it is a shame. i hope to see some thing from tatu in the future.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I've had this cd for 2 years, and I strongly feel this is his best. I don't have the GAOG yet, but from every other one of his albums that I own, this is the best. It's creepy at times, it has some dark humor in it, the music is dark and sometimes a bit haunting. This is a must have for all Manson fans, but if you're just gettng into his music, I suggest you buy his albums from first to latest. Truly a great buy, not a disappointment.
B000007MVL|4.0|This is by far my favourite of all kate's albums. her voice is fresh and melodic some thing to be treasured. her best song i think on this album is &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; I cant wait to hear more from kate the Red Shoes is the best musical ever for any one who likes a darker sound yet in a classical sense buy Lionheart or if you are a fan of kates already buy the box set &quot;This Womans Work&quot;
B000001Y5X|3.0|WHen I first heard this cd, I didn't like it one bit. Then it started to grow on me, and thought it isn't so bad. It's OK, not good nor bad, just average. It's his first album and I give him props for really trying, but the result was an average album. It's a classic, and it's what started the whole underground Manson movement. The lyrics are humorous, the intro is kinda spooky, and the little kid in Lunchbox was great. If you're thinking about buying this cd, I recommend you hear it first.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|Not much to say about this one.  The less you know the better.  It pretty interesting play on the time travel/alternate reality theme.  The small town feel adds to the movie's ambience and the Patrick Swayze scenes crack me up every time.  It doesn't really make any sense and you either like it because of it's ambivilence or you don't.<br />The acting is exceptional by everyone except Gyllenhal but he isn't bad enough to ruin the movie.  I listened to the commentary by the director and Gyllenhal and I swear that guy is the most self centered annoying twit of all time.  WHO WAS THE AD WIZARD THAT CAME UP WITH THAT ONE! no but seriously he came off like a fifteen year old punk who just got his first movie and thought he was GOD.  The music rocks to this movie with some nice 80's music but unfortunately they didn't have enough money to buy the publication rights so the soundtrack so they just put out an instrumental soundtrack.  <br />Bottom Line:  Not for everyone but if you are a child of the 80's or a fan of originality check this out.
B000001GRZ|5.0|It saddened me to read the reviews of Founier's recording of the Bach cello suites, especially the ignorant and completely unprecedented review comparing Fournier's recording to Kurt Cobain's guitar. Fournier's sound is glorious, full, and rich, and his technical abilities are without question some of the greatest. To play Bach's amazing cello suites is  a challenge in itself. To make music out of these suites is incredible. After becoming immensly familiar with other recordings by such cellists as Starker, Ma, Tortelier, Casals, Rostropovich and others, I can say that Fournier's playing of these suites is flawless, and despite the fact that sometimes one may not agree with a tempo or certain fingering, there is no denying that this is truly an excellent recording, by one of the greatest cellists ever.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Just recently I caught the Moulin Rouge fever...when it first came out in the movie theatres, I didn't even bother to go watch it.  I thought it was just another musical and I was not interested in musicals.  But, when I watched it on TV, I just had to own it.  This 2 disc DVD is perfect and fabulous for the Moulin Rouge fan.  The HBO Documentary is quite entertaining.  This is a well-made movie and definitely has set the new coming wave of musicals i.e. chicago and whatever musical movie that comes later...Baz Luhrmann is a genious for casting Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor...They are both fantastic in this movie.  Even though the plot is simple, I highly recommended it for both fans and non fans of musicals.
1563898586|5.0|The first story is a graphic novel which pits Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, HG Well's Invisible Man, H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, Robert L. Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll AND Bram Stoker's Minna Murray against an evil force, a crimelord so powerful that he may end up destroying much of London if not stopped.  The setting is placed in the late 19th century England, but a slightly twisted verison, lovingly detailed and illustrated by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill.<br />The second story places Allan Quatermain in a story with HP Lovecraft's Randolph Carter, Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter and HG Well's Time Traveller.  The setting is that of a story from Lovecraft, with unknown dangers and fear from beyond reality.  The story is very much in the style of a serial, with a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter and every chapter starting off with a few paragraphs to give you background information, as if you have been waiting weeks for the next issue!  The second story happens before the great adventures and events of the first, so you may wish to even start with that one first.  Both hint as great things to come.<br />I can't wait for the second volume!
B000069HK2|5.0|This is one of the most musically innovative and complex albums out today.  It is a popular album because it relates to its audience in very subtle, different ways by striking healthy balances both musically and lyrically: the need for freedom with control, for loud and soft, depth and charm, tension and release.  My favorite part of the whole thing is that each song, at the point of its most tense moment, breaks down into something more syncopated, more delicate.  It's classic rock, punk rock, alternative rock, melodic rock, all rolled into one.  Best songs: Blue and Yellow, A Box Full, Bulimic, Maybe Memories, Buried.  All the instruments shine: the percussion is the ring-leader, followed by the bass, then guitars, and even the piano finds its way onto this album.  Each instrument independently tells the story of the song, and the whole is greater than the sum of their parts, so this is a brilliantly successful album, so interesting to listen to.
0451169514|5.0|I am not going to go into much depth beyond my title. I usually only read reviews of books with 1-3 stars, but in this case, i have read this book 2 times over, and have to say that most of the horrible ratings are from people who shouldn't be reading King in the first place. <br />From experience I can tell you a horror story is the most difficult to write and I assure you, this book will GRIP YOU, I stopped reading it before bed for a while because it was messing with my dreams. It is that powerful, you will be IN this book, you will become the characters and feel strong emotions. Yes the movie [was bad], but this is a must have. Work past the (minor) typo-s, obviously the publisher was a little preoccupied while reading this. Enjoy
B00008AWOD|3.0|I'll have to say that I was over all disapointed with this cd.  This struck me as odd, because I have read so many positive reviews of this album.  Then why the sudden aversion?  I thought about this for a while, and I realized that customers who loved 'Without You I'm Nothing' also seemed to love 'Sleeping with Ghosts.'  If you haven't guessed already, my favorite Placebo tracks can be found on 'Black Market Music.'  I like the edgier, harder music while 'Ghosts' presented me with a more mellow sound that much resemebles the style of the tracks that I usually skip on previous cds.<br />   I find that my favorite song on the cd, 'Something Rotten,' seems to be the least liked by most fans.  The only other songs I really take the time to listen to are &quot;Protect Me from What I Want' and 'Centerfolds.'  I wasn't impresed with either of the two singles from this album.<br />  So if you're a big fan of 'Without you I'm Nothing,' buy this cd.  If you're more of a 'Black Market Music,&quot; type of person, buy it anyways (because, c'mon, it's Placebo), and listen to it a couple times through before shelving it.
B000031XCR|4.0|I've been a Celine Dion fan since 1997,when I first listened to &quot;My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme From 'Titanic')&quot; though I really hate this song now.I was an average fan until she released her &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; album;but since then I'm a huge fan and I'm adding her albums to my CDs to buy list while I'm incessantly downloading her songs.&quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; is still my favorite,but I can undoubtedly say that her other albums,which has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide are very very good,too! (Especially &quot;Falling Into You&quot;) So,such a great artist should have released a real &quot;greatest&quot; hits album instead of two consecutive compilation albums which are not more than average.For example,a double CD-set would have been great,just like Mariah Carey (my most and most favorite!) and Whitney Houston did.But she preferred to pick just nine hits which are never enough for such a superstar and fill the rest of the album with seven new songs.It's wonderful when a few new tracks are added to such compilation albums but seven ones are very much while just nine hits are added.If she had released a real greatest album,she wouldn't have needed to release two compilation albums one after one.The other one,&quot;Collector's Series Volume 1&quot; is another strange &quot;best of&quot; album because it mostly consists of unknown songs such as &quot;Us&quot; (it's one of my favorites but it's not a track of a compilation album.).Anyway,though there are a few songs in &quot;All The Way...A Decade Of Song&quot; I haven't listened yet,and I haven't bought it yet,I can say it's not a bad album.Especially hits such as &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot;,&quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;,&quot;To Love You More&quot;,&quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot;,&quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; and new tracks such as &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot;,&quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; and &quot;I Want You To Need Me&quot; are really glittering.I don't know the other European countries,but in my country,Turkey,the album has the Bee Gees duet &quot;Immortality&quot; instead of &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot;.This is bad,because I like &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot; much more.Shortly,&quot;All The Way...A Decade Of Song&quot; is good but not good enough.<BR>I think in the future she must release a large and really GREAT greatest hits album including the hits only.Celine fans really deserve this.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Will have to confess that I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it, 25 years ago!  And as long as I'm confessing here, will have to say that \\"Flounder's\\" my favorite \\"Delta\\"!  \\"Flounder\\" you say?  He's a \\"legacy from Harrisburg\\"!  You'll laugh (\\"may I have 10,000 marbles please?\\"), you'll cry (\\"what am I going to tell Fred?\\") & you'll cheer (\\"hey Niedermeyer!\\").  So grab a toga & a brewski (\\"it don't cost nothing\\") & enjoy!  And remember, the \\"Deltas\\" will be dang glad to see 'ya!
0553573403|5.0|Maybe this title is an oxymoron, but somehow this book achieves it. A Game of Thrones is one of the best books I've ever read. It might even be the best. Period! I am going to buy the second book today.<br />I've shied away from the fantasy genre for many years now because the books simply get predictable and boring. Characters become cliche; plots become didactic and have fairy tale endings; the writing style becomes transparent. With this book, none of that is true. If you're looking for a fresh perspective on the fantasy genre, this book will not disappoint.<br />George Martin has an extraordinary gift at writing. The story is woven together in seamless fashion. The character dialogue and their inner thoughts are so realistic that it felt as though I were watching a movie at times instead of reading.<br />That said, there are some qualities of this book which might not appeal to everyone. You might not like this book if you can't handle : 200 initial pages or so of raw character development; multiple character perspectives on events; complicated, political relationships between the characters; murder; rape; injustice; and a conservative dose of the typical fantasy elements like magic and monsters.<br />Hope you enjoy this as much as I did!
B00008DDXC|5.0|The title says it all.  The movie takes you on a wonderful journey.  It is nice to see all of the characters come back for more.
B0000399WI|5.0|In one of the most inspiring films ever made, Tim Robbins (as Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (as Red) give their best performances and enthrall the audience emotionally. <br />Convicted of killing his wife and lover, Andy, the banker, retains his hope for freedom. He comes across Red, the seasoned prisoner and an improbable friendship springs up between them. The excruciations and his unbendable hope make Andy stronger and determined, leading to freedom in his own way. <br />Bet you will never regret adding this movie to your DVD collection. <br />And remember: Fear can hold you prisoner; Hope can set you free.
B00005JM09|4.0|I took a day off from work just to see this. It was a great sequel and well worth the money to see it in the theater. I will not summarize the plot since everyone else has but will just say SEE THE MOVIE! Great action....excellent chase scenes....fulfills all of your expectations for a Terminator movie. <br />Yay!
B00003CXE6|3.0|Wow! I'm glad this movie got Oscars! It was deserved! The best of the year!.....Ooops wait! I was actually thinking of \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" (Which showed how politically unfair the Academy Awards were when they both lost best picture to this work of unoriginal, mediocre quality) The fighting scenes are entertaining, but between the action you'll want to fast forward over the unintelligent dialouge and card-board acting. Poor Russell Crowe, who was looked over at the Oscars for his  great performance in The Insider and won for a very overrated performance in this (If you watched the Oscars that night you'll know that he knew that as well). Poor Academy voters, who have yet to make up for continuing to let mediocre, non-challenging movies that has the artistic merit of a advertising billboard, win the top awards. It was entertaining! But also very lacking.
B00004Z459|4.0|I despise Nu-Metal. It is a disgrace to the face of all music and generally nothing more than a marketing ploy.  That said, every time I hear Linkin Park on the radio, I am captivated.  They have something that no other band in the genre has.  Between the honey-sweet 80's style vocals, the growling spittle-flecked wails and the rugged but straight-forward rap is a contrast that is simply spellbinding. Thunderous riffs don't hurt either. That one thing that Linkin Park has is balls--because it takes balls to sing that sweetly and hand such beautiful hooks to the audiences they play to.  Now, that said, there are problems.  <br />The biggest problem is that their lyrics are some of the most haphazard ever written.  They have a very poor understanding of human anatomy and biology and science and philosophy in general, which normally wouldn't matter for a band unless you are trying to describe things that you don't understand.  A face under your skin?  You can't see it, it can't see or smell or hear or breathe or speak or grin.  And if it could it wouldn't matter.  It's under your skin for god's sake!  It's called your conscience.  And how do you find bliss in ignorance?  If you're experiencing the bliss of ignorance, your ignorant to it. And you certainly can't tell me how blissful you are in your ignorance. If you're gonna try to get that deep you have to know what you're talking about in theory. They tend to make their points not only confusing but confounding by rewording cliches that they haven't dug into deep enough.  Some of their concepts will make your brain flicker like a bad flourescent bulb if you take the time to think them through.  In essence they're just throwing words around, which may work for Jack White in a simple Blues tribute, but it doesn't work for highly conceptual or emotional songs.  If they had a writer who could write, Linkin Park would be one of the best mainstream bands to hit the market in the past decade.  So if you need a sample of thegenre for historical purposes, this is the best album to own (I am discounting RATM and Faith No More since the originators of a genre are not really of any genre).  However, if you believe that poor lyrics can ruin brilliant music, this may not be for you.
B000099T3P|4.0|I saw CRITTERS on one of the IO channels because it was raining and I was bored.  I thought it was going to be terrible, but, to my surprise, it's quite entertaining and enjoyable.   It's a fun comedy/horror film in the vein of GREMLINS and it's very original.  Even in the beginning, before the \\"critters\\" even arrive on Earth, the movie isn't boring, because we are introduced to all the charctors of the family that dealt with the \\"critters\\" and we see some of their different situations.  Things really get goin' when the \\"critters\\" finally come!  It's very funny and freaky at the same time and you'll definately like it if you liked GREMLINS.
B000002U82|5.0|What else can i say but wow! This record is not only the top of the rock progressive and  part of the electronic music, it is a master piece of the universal music. I am a Pink Floyd fan, and i know they been a forward breaktrouhgt band for a long time. They were the first using the cuadrophonic sound, they beguin to make multimedia rock shows and the circular screen they always carry with is now imited by many bands all arround the world. I can say that Pink Floyd and the Beatles turn the rock music into an art thing, if you doubt it just listen to the \\"shine on your crazy diamond\\" song and try to hear, and listen (very atempt), and undearstand completlly  this one if you are a true music and arts lover: you will find good lyrics based on some phillosofying stuffs of life; the effects in this record are unforgeateble, you know, the cash machine, the laughs, the heartbeat from the intro to the ending and the gift of this four magnificent players: Roger waters, David Guilmoure, Richard Wright and Nick Mason (thanks a lot guys). You can always find a fascination around this record cause everithing matches so well; its smart, beautyfull, groovy, deep, perfect. And who can deny the elegance of the cover, a clasic of the gener. But if you wont bellieve in his trading power, get yourself entired now that this is one of the all time sellers, every year this record is aclaimed to be bougth by many people in many diferent countries, so if you now decided to purchase it, cogratulations, you wont be disapointed, bellive.
B000068FUS|4.0|The Drive-By Truckers are everything that Lynyrd Skynyrd hopes it still could be. The Truckers are earnest and relevant at a time when Lynyrd Skynyrd has fallen to trite and cliched.<br />This album is a truly American and southern experience, from the beginning and the main character's best friends death due to a car crash and the end when the character falls to his death in a plane crash.<br />In between is a cohesive story that not just tells the life and times of the band Lynyrd Skynyrd, but also the life of Southern men growing up dealing with racism, death and poverty as if they were all unchangable facets of life.<br />As cohesive as the album is together, there are individual songs that could make any band bow down to the Truckers abilities. &quot;72&quot; is a clever story about &quot;a mean old highway&quot; that holds only &quot;broken hearts&quot; or &quot;those about to break a heart.&quot; In simple words, the Truckers make the listener come to the conclusion that nothing good will come to this story.<br />&quot;Zip City&quot; is a beautiful story of a boy turning to a girl not for love, but for something to do and the ramifications of that on him, her and her family.<br />&quot;Women Without Whiskey&quot; is the classic women or the bottle story, except the narrator realizes that neither is the only option for him.<br />All 20 songs are brilliant and strong. All 20 form the cohesive vision of the South that the Truckers wanted to create, and perhaps most importantly, they all rock.

B00005NWM3|2.0|Nickelback's first album was a series of uppercuts being tossed at the upper-middle class Canadien people that lead singer Chad Kroeger grew up dispising.<br />Silver Side Up throws no uppercuts at such targets. Instead it throws jabs at targets that have already been kicked to the ground. They rehash the nu-metal territory of domestic abuse as the album begins with &quot;Never Again.&quot;<br />The album flickers for a few moments, as &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; throws a hard left at Kroeger himself and &quot;Too Bad&quot; throws a right at deadbeat fathers.<br />Other than that, Kroeger and the band's material slides almost painfully into the territory that all modern hard rock bands fall into: little to say and not well played.<br />Kroeger tries to toss jabs at the upper class (Look at what Your Money Bought, Hollywood), but his own money makes the jabs look a little hypocritical.<br />Perhaps the worst part of the whole album is that the promise of The State was replaced with the corporate rock within. Still, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and &quot;Too Bad,&quot; in moderate amounts are hope that rock music can still be endearing, touching, and more than a caricature of itself.
B000006NXP|5.0|This is a definite recording of Brahms Fourth. Carlos Keliber brings freshness, electricity to the symphony. Alhought Brahms fourth is considered as one with no plot, the music itself is moving and the performance of the Vienna Philhamonic Orchestra was superb.<br />Highly recommened.
0156027321|5.0|I won't rate a book until after I finish it and a few weeks have gone by.  For me, a truly great book is one that seeps back into your mind even after you've moved onto the next one.  This is such a book.<br />Not only is this an engaging tale (beware of reading this on your vacation, or you could miss the whole thing), but the book makes you consider such philosophical questions like:<br />- Are zoos a good idea?  Who benefits from them?<BR>- Which religion is right?  Can they all be right, or does one exclude the others?<BR>- What separates humans from animals?<BR>- What makes life worth living?<br />A book that keeps my nose faithfully between its pages while being read, and makes my mind dwell weeks later, is a book I'd recommend to anyone.  One of the most engaging I've read in a long, long time.
B000067IZ3|1.0|Hands down this the worst movie I have ever seen, long boring, I fell asleep 6 times. I wanted to leave before the end, but my wife wanted to ride this lemon out. A terrible film, a terrible waste of talent, I have seen better film on teeth. If you want or need a nap, then by all means, watch this lousy unbearable tedious lemon of a movie.
B0000584V3|5.0|I've read many long-winded album reviews where the writer gives examples of the shining moments, but to do so here would be condescending to Opeth.  This album is simply excellent.  Opeth makes albums, not 10-minute-epics strewn together in no determinate way to constitute what other lesser bands would call an album.  Opeth is unlike any band I have heard, both complex and beautiful.  I believe a new genre is being born: Progressive Black Metal.  It will be interesting to see the influence of this superb band on the future.  I can't wait!!
B000002BYD|5.0|Pearl Jam!  This is a flawless album.  People are hung up on &quot;Ten&quot; because of it's catchy riffs and sarcastic overtones. &quot;Yield&quot; truly is a balance of what Pearl Jam was and what they are becoming.  The songs on this record are arranged in a perfect balance of the Pearl Jam spectrum.  If you are looking for the Seattle rock sounds of the early 90's you will not be displeased.  They are contained right here, on this record.  Along with some more mellow tracks that have become a PJ signature.<br />They have progressed so much since the early days.  You can see a real growth in their character and in their song writing.  Add in the drum stylings of Jack Irons (former RHCP drummer) and you get PJ perfection.  <br />&quot;Given To Fly&quot; is clearly a Zeppelin influenced song, while &quot;Do The Evolution&quot; and &quot;In Hiding&quot; showcase Stone Gossard's progression as a songwriter.  The bass-driven &quot;Pilate&quot; shows Ament's contribution to the credits as well.  &quot;Yield&quot; is Just an over-all solid album worthy of many listens.  It restores the faith, if you will.  <br />Those of you who dropped off the PJ wagon after &quot;Ten&quot; need not be worried about liking this record or not.  If you don't enjoy this record, you are not a fan of music. ... Period!
B00006RU5B|4.0|With all the mediocrity on the radio these days it is no wonder this album stands out.  However, some of the production is overblown, and some of the slower tracks should have simply been trashed.  That criticism aside, Chris Cornell is back to his old howling self.  Praise the Lord!  After his sullen and unimpressive solo effort, \\"Euphoria Morning\\"(zzzzzzzzzzzz), his vocals on this album mark a return to form.  Easily the best rock singer of the grunge era, it was a shame to hear him singing in such limited range when his talent demands so much more.  I hope these guys stick together.  Their future looks promising.
0060254920|5.0|I remember reading \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" in elementary school.  So, after taking a Children's Literature class at West Virginia State College with Professor Samples, I decided to take another look at one of the most memorable books of my past.  I really enjoyed reading the book again but most of all I enjoyed the art work of Maurice Sendak.
B000003H2Q|5.0|This is simply My Dying Bride's finest hour.  Their other albums have many magnificent moments, but this album carries the greatness through to the very end.  If I were to recommend a place for newcomers to start this would be it.  The very first track, \\"The Cry of Mankind,\\" takes the listener on a haunting journey of cold sadness.  That may sound depressing, but My Dying Bride at its best is deeply emotional and musically transcendant.  Excuse me while I wax rhapsodic, but this album deserves praise.  \\"The Angel and the Dark River\\" is a triumph!!!
B00006JIA4|4.0|Wow. That's alot of Queen. 51 tracks over 3 cds constitutes a bucket of Queen. Do you really need that much queen? Not really. Either the Greatest Hits/Classic Queen duo or Greatest Hits I+II will do you much better. Freddie MErcury's voice, arguable one of the best ever heard, puts itself above others like Michael Jackson and Jeff Buckley in the first two volumes of this compilation. The sheer amount of emotion he channels into his singing (The Show must go on, Don't Stop me Now) defies comprehension. Queen is about Freddie Mercury's singing, and freddie mercury's singing shines the most in the first two volumes. The third does have such songs as 'Princes of the universe', which while they were radio hits, made it more due to the catchiness of the lyrics than the quality of music.<BR>Should this beyour first Queen purchase, go for it. The more Queen you can hear, the better. however, if you've bought an album or one of the disc on the collection, pass this up.The Third and special disc is wasted.<br />Should you be a die-hard Queen fan, it may appeal more, but the albums from whence the third disc came are probably a better place to get the music. There are no previously unrealeased songs on the third disc, no incentive. Pass on this boxed set, go buy something else from the esteemed and wonderful Queen.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I stumbled onto this CD by chance - was listenning to a music review program.  I immediately purchased the CD (from Amazon.com) and I've been listenning to it since I got it three weeks ago.  Beside the fact that I love these songs, I find the quality of performance for a live show to be incredible.  This goes both for voice and instrumental.  The guitar and drums solos are fantastic - makes you feel you want it to never end!  I've been replaying some songs dozens of times, just because of its hipnotic effect.  I strongly recommend this CD to any rock lover.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Terrific CD!  I am totally hooked on this music!  Definitely one of those CD's were you LOVE the whole album.<BR>A great CD for a drive too.  The kind of music you can just listen to over and over again!<BR>If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I read all the books, I did not believe it was possible to create half of what was written in a fantasy fairy tales into a movie and make it look so real. Hollywood must be organized for miracles and decide to perform them to the public.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This is one of the best movies released in 2000.  Cameron Crowe amazingly reflects on his times as a writer while traveling with legendary bands(Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, The Eagles, etc.).  He takes certain events that occurred during each tour and gives it to the movie's band.  Every piece of that fits perfectly amongst one another to create one masterpiece movie.  It's great that Crowe can make some of those serious events and put some comedy in them. Therefore, he was well-deserving of his Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.<BR> Patrick Fugit makes a triumphant debut as William Miller.  If he continues to do movies in this style, he'll go far with his acting career.  Why did Marcia Gay Harden win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress(\\"Pollock\\") over Kate Hudson as \\"Penny Lane\\"?  Who knows.  Frances McDormand performs wonderfully outside her usual style as William Miller's overprotective mother.  This is Billy Crudup and Jason Lee at their best as the lead guitarist and lead singer of Stillwater.  Though Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin had minor roles as band aids, their acting shined.  This is one of Paquin's best roles since her Oscar winning role(at the age of 11) in \\"The Piano\\".<BR> \\"Almost Famous\\" could be a huge influence for those who dream of making the big-time in music, any genre.  This is also a good one for those who are looking for quality comedy.  There are many surprises so one will laugh unexpectedly in various parts.  Why wasn't it nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director for 2000?  Who knows. <BR>
B00005JLSE|5.0|Now, I love both Chicago and Moulin Rouge to bits. They are both masterpieces in their own rights! But, I dont understand why all the people who hated Chicago keep comparing it to Moulin Rouge! Voicing their opinions and saying Moulin Rouge is better. Why do you keep comparing these two movies together? Just because they are musicals made around the same time doesnt mean they are anything alike. They are totally different from each other. You might as well compare West Side Story to Chicago or even the Sound of Music!!! Its absurd, so please stop doing it!<br />Anyway, Chicago is an extraordinary film! Unlike most musicals, yes! But that is part of its charm!
B00005QFE5|5.0|Everything is fast these days, Life itself is very fast, these days.  I wish we can just sit down peacefully and enjoy a moment's quite elegance.  And this is what this movie is. You can't call it slow or boring.  That would be disrespectful.  Or, I guess you didn't get it.  The movie starts in Black and White with a very simple premise.  An old woman's determined request to have her dead husband brought home on foot through the road that has been such a part of their lives, so his soul will always know the road home.  Simple enough?  Actually it turns into a tall order because it is in the dead of winter and there's isn't enough able bodied people to lug the coffin around.  But this is just a footnote of the movie.  The movie is really about true love that is delicate and  unrelenting.  It is a classic Zhang Yimou movie.  You can tell it is one of his  even without seeing his name in the credits. It's like looking at a child and knowing who his parents are.  Which is a good thing.  It is gorgeous to look at. The setting is photographed beautifully and carefully detailed in every shot.  The same attention is also given to the actors, specially Zhang Ziyi. Gorgeous scenery, beautiful actors, a simple moving story and there you have it. You can't help but enjoy  this movie.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert kiyosaki is Great book to start somewhere in the world of economics. It teaches you some good alternatives to see that the rich and the poor can be equally parted in an overall situation of incomes . A great lesson taught overrall is how to make money work for  you ,not the other way around.
B00009L1TA|3.0|Basic had all the ingedients to be a good thriller. It had a well known director with a well deserved cast and a story with multiple plot twists that involved deception, murder, corruption, and a hint of romance. So what went wrong? What really went wrong with it was that the ending wasn't worth all the confusing plot twists that happened during the film. The ending wasn't worth all the figuring out I tried to do. And I really wasn't all that shocked or surprised with the ending. With films like these, you kinda have to expect a ending like the ending of Basic. I was never really interested enough in the film to really care about how it ended. The performances were great, the chemistry between Travolta and Nielsen was definitely there, and McTiernan did a fine job on the direction, but I really think this film failed at producing an interesting enough story to really care about the plot twists and its ending.
B000002H97|5.0|This is an amazing album. Powerful lyrics, incredible riffs, absolutely beautiful work. An essential album for any rock or metal fan. Even those who call it a &quot;sellout&quot; still secretly love it. Tracks like Enter Sandman and Wherever I May Roam show off the true talent of each individual member of the band, and they slow it down on Nothing Else Matters and The Unforgiven, very uncharacteristic songs of Metallica but incredible nonetheless. Every song is a masterpiece in and of itself. Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
1400031354|5.0|This book is a continuation of the first book, THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY, and is even better.  It would be best to read the first if you can, but this is good on its own.  Precious Ramotswe is the no. 1 lady detective, and she is a detective in Botswana, Africa.  Along with her mysterious cases, we get to learn about the culture in Botswana and we are entertained by the budding romance between Precious and the man she is engaged to.  An entirely delightful book.  I highly recommend it.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|I bought this album under the &quot;electronica&quot; section, but it is anything but. Sure, there are a few whooshes and plinks, but this is mostly a lounge/folk myriad. The tracks do differ somewhat in style. Track 1 sounds almost like a celtic ballad, but then track 2 becomes a kind of R&amp;B song, complete with horns. Track 3 is very downbeat, even sad. It takes a few listening-tos to assess the album. Don't expect Portishead, even though Adrian Utley is part of the crew. Mrs. Gibbons obviously wanted to escape the trip-hipster label and go a bit more...traditional. All of the tracks are very good. The lyrics are unoriginal (that's why I give it 4 stars), but Mrs. Gibbon's singing personality is one-of-a-kind.
B00005JKED|1.0|Every time I watch a Denzel Washington movie, I am watching Denzel's fiery, over-the-top persona.  Thankfully, most of the movies he has done are well suited to this persona.  Of course, I have not seen all of his movies, but the ones I have seen (Training Day, The Hurricane, Remember the Titans) back up this observation. I guess that John Q., Malcolm X, Antwone Fisher will give me the same \\"explosive performance.\\"  Sure, it is good occasionally, but brilliant?  I wouldn't go that far.  <br />In Training Day, Denzel is his usual self.  His performance is adequate because the role is scripted for his style. However, the premise of the movie is so ridiculous that Denzel's usual, predictable work only adds fuel to this sinking ship.  The police officers (mainly Denzel's character) are so totally corrupt and sink to such depths that any rational person would have a hard time accepting their antics, even on a lazy Saturday afternoon with nothing else to do.  My advice?  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous and predictable movie.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is Snoop's best album. The beats are classic old school. The beats are great, since Dr. Dre produced them. The rapping is the old school type. Snoop's voice on his album isn't like it is now. It's cooler and makes the songs better. The flows are great, too. Most of the songs talk about getting high, pimpin,  having sex and partying all night. But that doesn't bother me. As long as the songs are tight, I'm OK with it. All the songs are good,  but the best ones are: G Funk Intro, Gin n Juice, Lodi Dodi, Murder Was The Case, GZ And Hustlas, Serial Killa, and Who Am I. <br />If you want to hear some good old-school rap or just a big fan of Snoop Dogg, you gotta buy this album.
B000002UA2|5.0|Ita a shame that this cd never got any airplay at all because most of the songs are very radio accesible . track 1 obscured by clouds is kind of a cool moody piece that Waters describes in the pompeii movie as a &quot;bad cut&quot; Burning Bridges is a great song with Wright and Gilmour trading vocals and some good harmonies. The gold its in the.. is a great pop rock tune unlike anything they ever did. Also had a great 2 minute fade out guitar solo. Wots uh the deal is one of my all time favorite Floyd songs. It has a great mood and should have been a radio hit.Mudmen is basically Burning Bridges but instrumental and is also a great song. Childhoods End is a perfect Gilmour song and stands up with anything he ever wrote. Great rock song. Free Four is probably the most familiar cut on here and is a great pop song with heavy lyrics. Stay is a great Wright song and sounds very 70s. Overall this is a must for any Floyd fan that may be scared to buy anything pre Dark Side. When i was in high school in the 80s this was all I listened to and i never got sick of it.Its definately in the top 3 Floyd albums of all time.
B000002KLZ|5.0|Most of the live shows tend to be faithful reproduction of the albums.  Fleetwood Mac is a great studio band as evidenced by their albums.  But don't forget that they are a great live band as well.  They don't just try to reproduce the songs' sounds from the respective albums.  Familiar songs with new arrangements are refreshing and also challenging to the listeners.  This live album include pre-Buckingham/Nicks tune Oh Well, highlighting Buckingham's underrated guitar playing.<BR>Most other tunes are well known ones from their Self-titled, Rumour and Tusk.  One song that is not on any other album, Fireflies stands out.  On the liner notes it says it was recorded during the sound check.  Anyway, it would fit in any of their albums.  It is a classic.  Another one of my favorite is Farmer's daughter, a Beach Boys tune.  Buckingham was heavily influenced by Brian Wilson and here he pays his respect by reworking a little known Beach Boys song.  It's spare arrangement (just a bass guitar &amp; drum I think) &amp; emphasis on harmonizing vocal give it an almost mystical quality.<BR>Overall, it's an outstanding album to have in your collection.
0316666343|5.0|Our narrator Susie Salmon is already in heaven. Raped and murdered by a neighbor when she was only fourteen years old, Susie tells us the details of what happened to her and what it is like to be in her new place. <br />From Heaven she watches her once happy family collapse as they try to deal with the unbearable -and unsolved- crime, while Susie herself yearns for the one thing she can't have: to live with the people she loved.<br />As the years go by, Susie's friends and siblings grow up, fall in love, and do all the things that Susie never had a chance to do herself. Yet while the murder remains still unsolved, no one is really able to make peace with the loss of Susie and she herself that can't let go. She tries to communicate from the \\"other side', but can't really connect, until a startling climax which brings a kind of resolution, and Susie can make her peace and move on.<br />Alice Sebold's novel, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" has so much feeling and power of how a worst thing a family can face, can suddenlly be transformed into a suspenseful novel about love, memory, joy, heaven, and healing.<br />Out of all the books I have ever read my whole life, Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of my favorites of all time. I acutally wept reading this book. It has truely brought out all emotions in me to just feel what each character in this book is feeling, and I think if you read this wonderfully written book, you will feel it too. It's one of the best books out there, where you'll never forget reading.<BR>It has really brought out the true meaning of the healing power of grief.<br />Everything we experience here is filtered through Susie's eyes and voice. In the end, it's not Susie herself but her family and friends, drawn so uniquely, that brings her so compellingly to life.
0679745203|4.0|This novel is sensual and thrilling.  The characters are so interwoven and intricate.  It is a fairly quick read with a complex story.  Even more fasinating are the allusions to history and art.  Allusions that work themselves into the plot unlike anyother novel I have ever read.  <br />The only flaw in this novel (and it is a major one)is that the character of Kip (one of the most interesting characters) behaves out of character and more for the political protest of the author.  This is the only reason why I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5 stars.
0140177396|5.0|Here is a very well written stroy of a friendship that can only end in disaster. <br />Loliness is a key theme here. Curley's wife lonely because she is a woman, Crooks because he is black, Candy because he is old. However, the characters have some kind of dream. Curley's wife wishes she was an actor whilst Whit uses his ranch magazines to help him imagine his little cowboy fantasies. <br />George and Lennie are different. Their friendship means that they do have a chance to make something with their lives. However, when that relationship ends they become as helpless as the others.<br />This is a brilliant book, though pretty much miserable all the way through, which mocks the idea of America being 'the land of opportunities...'
0451191153|5.0|This is a glorious book. It should provide a beacon of hope and inspiration to anyone who has struggled to stay true to their own vison.  I recommend it to anyone who works in a creative field, after reading this you will realize that you are NOT crazy or alone in your vocation and its consequences.<br />Beautifully written, with characters and scenery that are 3 dimensional and alive, the story rings clear like a church bell, even when re-visited over and over again.  You will recognize these characters in the world around you, and so the Fountainhead will become more vivid and relevant.<br />Objectivism fails to answer some of life's questions to the same degree as any other philosophy, but its emphasis on independence, courage, hard work, creativity, truth, and the respect for the effort to live such ideas is important.  Likewise Rand paints in believable colors the opposition to a person such as Howard Roark, and such opposition is alive and real.  I have met a variety of Second-Handers, thankfully none so adept as Ellsworth Toohey.
B00005JM09|2.0|This movie is just like a Terminator: It crashes around, makes alot of loud noise but is actually brain-dead. This film was supposed to be a \\"Blockbuster\\" but I did'nt get that impression when I was watching it. The Arnold is the only actor from the original film who plays the same character that he did in the firat 2 films. <br />  Terminator 3's big \\"draw\\"? A female terminator! (Whoopee..) She blows up stuff real good, can inflate her cha-cha's and can make cars drive themselves by taking over their cruise control systems. This movie's writers should have tried activatating their car's cruise control and letting go of the wheel: Presto -no more bad scripts. <br />   As I was watching this tribute to destruction, I kept asking myself \\"Would'nt the terminators cause a Moebius Strip?\\", an endless loop in time: Kid grows up into Terminator controlled world-->sends Terminator to past-->Terminator saves kid in past-->kid grows up into......<br />  Bottom line: the movie is OK if you do not think too much while watching it.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I will get right to the point. This is my favorite movie of all time. It has everything including Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe, my favorite actor and actress. It also has a perfect soundtrack. The songs actually liven the mood of whatever scene they are featured in, unlike some other films out there. The sets are amazing too, really breathtaking. Kathryn's room is done is ice blue, because that is what she is...cold. Sebastian's is rich gold and brown, because he has that soft inner side to him which eventually does come out in the movie when he falls in love with Annette. I won't bore you with the details or what the movie is about, because every other review has done that already. All I can say is that this movie is perfect, because it has an original plot & it's a modern telling of an alltime classic novel. You couldn't ask for a more talented cast including the wonderful Reese Witherspoon and newcomer Selma Blair. This is a movie that once you watch, you want to watch it over and over again. There's something new each time you watch it. The DVD is amazing also. It has TONS of special features including commentary, deleted scenes, information on the set design which is very interesting and informative, interviews with the cast and crew, two wonderful music videos and of course the theatrical trailer. A wonderful DVD for an amazing movie. The ending is wonderful also. Unlike some movies, you can't predict what will happen.
B000093BDX|2.0|\\"It's OK\\" missing?  NOT okay!  Their best 45 release in the 70s, and a personal favourite for Mike Love's lyrics: \\"Lookin' Good Down The Hood Of A Funky Ride, On The Way To The Tide Just To Tan Yer Hide....\\"There are rumours that a two CD set is being compiled on the BBs, featuring 40 top 40 international hits.  Wait for it instead.  This gets two stars because it would be a good purchase for neophytes -- or as a gift for Christmas, birthdays, etc. If you're serious about learning the BBs' legacy, pick up GH 1, 2, and 3.  Or buy the box set. By the way, for those not \\"in the know\\" about the Beatles, they had many other #1 hits worldwide, including the posthumous \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Free As A Bird\\".  Beatles 1 should've been two -- CDs, that is.
B000092ZYX|4.0|As a dedicated fan of Radiohead and all of their work, early and latest, i have to say that Hail To The Thief brings back a taste of Pablo Honey and The Bends what with the There There music video played on MTV and the days when Radiohead created music for the mainstream of music listeners.  A great album HTTT has proved itself, but one negative thing i would say about the release is this: the fast pace at which the album was produced is apparent to me.  It does not display the time taken for editing and perfecting as does Kid A and Amnesiac.  Some songs, such as Go To Sleep and Scatterbrain come off to me as put together to fill up time and do not possess Thom's wide range of emotions expressed through his voice.  For this, I take one star away from the otherwise 5-star album.  2+2=5, the first song on the cd, gave me chills the first time I listened to it, and I was still equally impressed by the time Wolf at the Door rolled around, wrapping the cd up beautifully.  A highly recommened purchase for anyone seeking an alternative from your average album.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I am fairly new to Pet Sounds.  I got this album about 8 years ago along with the Pet Sounds Box Set.  <br />Although it took a little time to get used to, and comparing it with others of the time (particularly The Beatles' Revolver and Sgt. Pepper), I found that this album stood right beside those as one of the best albums of the time. <br />The one big highlight for me is \\"God Only Knows\\".  In my opinion it is the BB's greatest song.  I just get such chills everytime I hear it - I get choked up too.<br />Other highlights, obviously the popular songs (Wouldn't Be Nice, Caroline No. and Sloop John B.) but also I Know There's An Answer, and I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.<br />This album has to be heard to be believed!!<br />Once you hear this, you'll want to get the Pet Sounds Box Set.
B000022TSW|3.0|has some classic moments like what cartman says to garrison after seeing the movie and canada adresses the U.N. i got kinda bored. one big problem is Canada looked to be winning the invasion. America would kick canada's A$$!
0201633612|5.0|I don't think a book of this high quality, and as widely recognized needs a few more words of praise from me.<br />I was simply surprised with some people rating it poorly.  This is one of those rare books that you cannot find fault with.<br />I've read each one of those patterns, and while there have a few points on which I could have argued with the authors, it has stood the test of time and changing technology.  That in itself is proof enough that these are truly patterns, language and technology and platform independent.  These patterns are valid in any object-oriented environment.  Some patterns may benefit from some language features, and that has be accurately described in the book.
B00006F83Y|4.0|although there are a few uh.. not so good tracks like six shooter this album is one of my favorites. qotsa are their own category! they are the best band ever.. but this isnt their best album. buy rated R.   this album is truly crazy and thats what makes it amazing. great tracks are track 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12,+ 13. hmm.. pretty much all of them
B00009V93Z|5.0|As another reviewer stated, this collection truly is a goldmine for Elvis fans.  To me, CD3 was alone practically worth the price--these takes would have made a great album if released in the '60s.  Some takes in the collection even strike me as being better than the standard releases, for example, \\"In My Way\\" on CD2.  I normally don't like concert CDs, but the concert here is indeed extrodinarily good.  And though some studio chatter and false starts are included, these are not distracting and each track ultimately is a complete performance of the song.  I hope there are more albums like this in the offing!
B00006AW2M|5.0|There are some albums where the &quot;like/hate&quot; lines are fixed, immutable, drawn hard daring anyone to cross. This is one such album. I don't like it, I LOVE it! It is so freaking weird coming from the Stones, no, coming from ANYBODY, and therein lies the pleasure. I take issue with those that say that it's mindless, minor-league psychedelic fluff. Intentionally or not, there's an unmistakable menace to &quot;2,000 Light Years From Home,&quot; a claustrophobia to &quot;Sing This All Together (See What Happens),&quot; and a skewed troubling lunacy to everything else that rivals the first two Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix albums for best head trip from 1967. And, besides, with 36 years between then and now, do you really CARE that Mick Jagger isn't singing here about not gettin' any ? I sure don't. I'd rather hear this.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb manages to breathe life into a lot of abstract ideas by using his own idiosyncracies or those of other people to illustrate how prone we all are to mistakes in this maddeningly random world. Easy to read &amp; a wealth of sharp points.
B000002I25|5.0|This collection of songs from this strange, wonderful band that coexisted with the &quot;summer of love&quot; was 100% unique at the time. It may not sound so unique to the casual listener today because it has been so widely imitated by the mimimalist rockers of various generations. But it was and is unique.<br />I was a working musician when this was released, albeit 16 years old, and I heard it for the first time surrounded by other musicians. Instant ecstatic amazement!! Sure they were not highly trained musicians,. We didn't care, it sounds great. I suppose if you over-think the lyrics, they are a little goofy. So??? You're suppose to experience it. You listen, you get that reward.<br />There are very few unambiguous &quot;wows&quot; in the arts. Hamlet, Beethovens 9th, Starry Night by Van Gogh, Some Walt Whitman, Guernica, perhaps Pynchon's V, probably On the Road. But at least two of them came the same summer of 1967 with Hendrix's debut Are you Experienced and this album, The Doors. It makes you think, it helps you feel, it really hits you. Great art does that. It cannot be ignored. <br />All the 20 somethings I know who have heard it have bought it. Show me the modern counterpart? Nirvana makes you feel, but think? Recommended for the higher IQ set with functional ears. You won't be disappointed.
B000006TRV|2.0|I like Pink Floyd. I once owned several PF vinyl LPs, back in the day. But when I heard this slab of gloom I just could not handle it. This is the most dark and depressing music that PF have ever released, and this is from a band that made a career of darkness and depression. So you can imagine just how bad this is.<br />Musically, it's brilliant, but the lyrics and theme drag it all down into an abyss. Then the band released the movie and added depressing images to the music. I actually sat through The Wall movie in a theater and I felt like committing suicide when I left.<br />I hope Roger Waters sought professional help after recording this.
0385335482|2.0|This book started out well enough, with a lot of funny and laugh inducing introspections on the heroine's part.  I couldn't help but identify with the heroine in her constant need to shop and her obsession with designer brands.  However, about halfway through the book, the heroine's antics becomes grating and extremely annoying.  Not only is she completely lacking in self-control, she's also immature and irresponsible, running and hiding from her creditors instead of looking for a solution out of her financial dilemma.  Despite the author's efforts to paint her as a very spunky and imaginative person, everything that has happened to her comes from good luck instead of any hard work on her part to change her circumstances.  It made the whole story extremely hard to swallow for me. Needless to say, I won't be standing in line to buy the rest of the book in this series.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of some of the best hits from the fabulous Fleetwood Mac. Just hearing these old songs again made me love them even more. I was very glad to see some songs included on 'The Dance' tour and enjoyed listening to my favourites again. However, since I am in England, I did not get the opportunity to buy the 2 disc CD, and so am missing some of my favourite hits, such as Stevie's wonderful 'Silver Springs'. To conclude, this is a fantastic listen and would recommend it to any Mac fan, or even those who aren't fans should listen and maybe they'll become fans too!
B000069HK2|5.0|I'm from Utah, that's where these guys are from. Finally an amazing band comes out of my state that rocks. These guys have been my favorite band forever and their album proves they're going places. I do not dislike any track on this album, but i do like some more than others. &quot;A Box Full Of Sharp Objects&quot; might be my favorite, the vocals on this song are amazing. Bert can scream without it being unbearable. &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; shows how much emotion this band has. &quot;Blue And Yellow&quot; shows the softer/more melodic side of the album with a sing -along chorus, great drums and great guitar. &quot;Greener With The Scenery&quot; is also a bit milder than others but i love the bass at the beginning of the song. All and all this album rules, these guys have really inspired me and I reccoment this CD to anyone. Also check out the bonus track &quot;Choke Me&quot; It's sick.
B00006LI4S|4.0|After several times watching my two favorite artists [ Dave from DVD&quot;David gilmour in concert&quot; .and Rogers's &quot;In the flesh&quot;].I have a feeling like a kid sitting in a midle of a divorced parents . both are so great, but wasted so much on something that nobody want to. Anyway, this DVD is a great one to have. It contents some amazing acoustic sounds that seems lightly opposition of &quot;Sound of thunder&quot; &amp; &quot; Pulse&quot;. Hopefully one days. we have the true, reunited Pink+Floyd. [ Just the HIGH HOPE?].
038572179X|1.0|Terrible book because it create expectations of &quot;atonement&quot; and then gets caught up in its own underware. Asking if the following sentence is &quot;true&quot; -- &quot;This sentence is not true.&quot; is comprable to the theme you are to discover and contemplate in this book. Worse, the slow development is painful.<br />The only positive is that the book is an accurate depiction of the mean spirited nature of a dying British class system.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|In my opinion, FAIR WARNING was the heaviest album VAN HALEN had made up to that point.  While the first albums have some killer songs with great melodies, on this album I think the band decided to throw all that to the wind and just get down and play some hard,heavy music. While other reviewers are right in stating that songs from this album are hardly played on classic rock stations, if you base you opinion on that fact, then you will be missing out on some great music. The album starts off with the heavy rocking MEAN STREET, which is a very good way to kick off any album. DIRTY MOVIES is next and it continues on the path that MEAN STREET started us on. SINNERS SWING while not as dark has a good guitar groove to it and some good rhythem to it. HEAR ABOUT IT LATER goes back to the heaviness of the first couple of songs and it just rocks you socks off. Of course the next song is the classic UNCHAINED, which is about the only song you will hear on rock radio these days. It starts off with a killer guitar intro along with a great drum backbeat throughout. I think on this song the band clicked on all cylinders. Hands down the definitive track off this album. I think you get the point by now, this album just rocks and for some unknown reason it gets overlooked. I highly recommend that you go out and get this album. You will not be disappointed.
B000069CWE|3.0|Well, it isn't Linkin Park's best work, but it's alright.  Personally, I think Linkin Park was just fine without Motion Man and Fags, but, they're still good.  Some remixs are just skipping versions of songs from Hybrid Theory, and others are really good.  Their Remix CD \\"Reanimation\\" reminded me of their earlier work, which was better.  It's still okay though, so It's up to you if you want to buy this so-so work.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Rating this just as a movie, it is great.  Rating it as a translation of the book, its not so good.  Some of the funniest scenes in the book were changed (or left out).  When Harry and Ron arrive at school, they look into the great hall and wonder where Professor Snape is when suddenly they hear his voice from behind them (very funny).  The movie translation, they walk up the stairs and right up to Filch (not funny).  The small side plots in the book were totally left out in the movie.  It makes me wonder what kind of butcher job they are going to do to the third movie (probably in post production  now).
B000065U1N|5.0|Great, realistic movie, but a lot of misunderstandings.  Task Force Ranger consisted of Army Rangers and Delta, Navy SEAls, and Air Force Para Rescue personnel, NOT marines.  This movie is about actual events.  MASH, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Three Kings, etc are fiction with minimal facts thrown in.  Saving Private Ryan, another great movie, did not have any lame references to other film makers.  Private Ryan was based on the book D-Day, by Ambrose.  The soldier walking the beach carrying his own arm was an actual event.  BHD was not racist.  If anything it showed the Somalis in a better light than they deserved.  The majority of the Ranger deaths occured while the Somalis were using women and children as shields and the Americans held their fire.  And, if you act like animals its not racist to be portrayed the same, regardless of your race.  Its a fact that Special Operations Forces are made up of primarily, but not all, of middle class white males.  It is the only place in the military where standards have not been dropped for politically correct reasons.  Although it is tragic that 18 americans died, several friends of mine, that fact does not take away from the flexibility and courage shown by those on the ground.
B00007LTIG|4.0|It holds up well with their peers.  It's not as great as, say Buffalo Springfield's first, but at least it's recorded well which the Springfield can't really claim.<br />There's a mis-mash of material here, blues rock and folk, that prefigures the band's sound.  I find it interesting how much some of the tighter songs here (&quot;Cream Puff War&quot;, &quot;Cold Rain and Snow&quot;) prefigure the sounds of later bands.  &quot;Cream Puff War&quot; sounds like Echo and the Bunnymen circa &quot;Crocodiles&quot;.<br />The album finishes with an impressive &quot;Viola Lee Blues&quot;.  On the whole, nice if not perfect.
B00005OM4N|4.0|The third album from Britney is one of the best pop albums of the year.  It shows people that she is not only a singer/ dancer, but that she can write her own meterial, and do an impressive job at it.  The album has a more rock edge to britney on songs like \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Lonely\\", and, of course, \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\".  The album shows people that Britney is here to stay.  <br />1. Im A SLave 4 U - This song is one of the hip-hop inspired tracks of the album.  Its one of the song that puts you in the dance mood, and makes you feel good. 9/10<br />2. One of my favorite Britney songs.  It is a very edgey song, and gives us a sense of Britneys rock side.  The songs lyrics also tell us that Britney is done being a childish-pop product.<BR>10/10<br />3. Lonley- This song is a very odd song.  Something britney has never done before, and something that makes this album seperate from \\"Oops\\", and \\"Baby\\".  The songs lyrics are a little weak, but still show you that Britney is evolving in her music.  8/10<br />4. Im Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman- This song was the song featured for Britneys first movie, \\"Crossroads\\".  The song is pretty good, being the only ballad on the album.  This song is kind of like \\"Overprtected\\" in lyrics.  9/10<br />5. Boys- This song is kind of like \\"Im A Slave 4 U\\".  Its a hip-hop inspired song that is just about having fun.  It will put you in the happy, dance type mood.  10/10<br />6. Anticipating- This song sounds like Janet Jacksons \\"All For You\\"  music wise, but, lyric wise it is a song about finding someone one night at a club and just telling them to lose themselves in the moment.  9/10<br />7. I Love Rock \\"n\\" Roll- The song is a remake of its old version.  It is the most rock inspired song on the album.  It is also one of my favorites. 10/10<br />8. Cinderella- Very cool song.  The music is a kind of haunting rendition of \\"Stronger\\".  The lyrics are simply brilliant, and show Britneys best at song writer.  10/10<br />9. Let Me Be- This songis a little weak on its music, its lyrics really hold up where the music sags, but none the less, the song is very good.  8/10<br />10. Bombastic Love- This song also has a dark kind of music to it, but, its a kind of music that shows people Britneys edgier side on the album.  The lyrics are pretty good as well.  You'll grow into loving the song the more you listen too it. 10/10<br />11. Thats Where You Take Me- This is my least favorite track.  It has good lyrics, and cool music, but, its not really a song that makes you wanna listen to it over and over.  Although, it does stand out from any other of Britney's songs. 9/10<br />12. What Its Like To Be Me- Awesome song.  It kind of sounds like Nsyncs \\"POP\\" and seeing the Justin wrote it, i guess that i shouldnt be surprised.  Never the less, it is another brilliant masterpeice. 10/10
B000002O4S|5.0|I had this tape when the movie first came out.  Due to extreme heat and sun in my car, the tape melted and I never replaced it.  So 10 or so years later, here I am buying the CD and I LOVE IT.  It is one of my all time favs!!!
6305252521|3.0|When I saw the Truman Show for the first time, I liked the film, but it wasnt the best film I ever saw. The film shows the way Hollywood could work in future. <BR>But there is one thing in this film I dont like, the film shows many people who are fans of the Truman Show and Truman himself, but there is only one person shown, Sylvia, who tries to help Truman out of this faked world. In my opinion it is not realistic, that there is no riot, when a babychild is addoped by a company.
B00009V7RF|5.0|When I went to go and see the Justified Stripped concert in Orlando, I figured that The Blackeyed Peas were going to just be some band that weren't too down with the music business yet and were trying to get it started... They sure proved me wrong!! They were the PERFECT opening to a phenomenal concert. They got the entire crowd bouncing along with their upbeat music style and when they started busting out their hit single \\"Where Is The Love?\\" I was all for jaming with them. They will definitly be one of the bands that I will be looking for upnext for a tour. They were all around a great band, and I can't wait to be singing along with them again. I also recommend their new CD \\"Elephunk\\" because it's awesome!!
055357342X|5.0|In this book, Martin continues the saga he started in _A Game of Thrones_. Caution: If you have not read _A Game of Thrones_, start there. This series is contiguous, and you will spoil things for yourself if you don't read the books in order.<br />That said, if there are ever textbooks written for fantasy literature, George R.R. Martin's _Song of Fire and Ice_ series (or some part of it) will be included. The writing is brilliant. Each word counts. Phrases that are supposed to be witty actually ARE. Events that promise to surprise you DO. Characters who are supposed to be clever do genuinely clever things. In addition, Martin produces countless unique turns of phrase with the casual ease of a master.   <br />As for plot, these books represent the very best of a budding genre. To call the series high fantasy and compare it to Tolkien is not quite fair. Tolkien based his work on myth. Martin bases his primarily on history, and his work should properly be called a fantihistorical. Although the series has elements of myth, the most astonishing facts are nearly always historical. The Targarian habit of marrying brother to sister to preserve the bloodlines, for instance, was practiced by the Egyptian pharaohs. You will actually learn real things about history if you pay attention in this series. Martin's meticulous details are dazzling-types of cloth and food, details of trade and political agreements, a proper proportion of elderly, mentally ill, and sickly people in society, and realistic process of infection from wounds. His medicines are also well-researched, many of them used in some society at some time. <br />_A Storm of Swords_ is every bit as good as the other two books. The tension just builds and builds. Any hint of the contents would spoil something for you, but I think I can say without giving away any secrets that the addition of Jamie Lanister's viewpoint gives a very interesting tange to the story (believe it or not, he's now one of my favorite characters), and that several well-known characters die in this one. Martin has an absolute genius for making nearly all of his characters round and sympathetic. Even the ones we want dead are sympathetic, though that doesn't stop us from wanting them dead. Martin shows clearly that all of  his characters, both good and bad, have suffered and have excuses for being cruel and bitter. His good characters, however, choose to remain honorable and ethical, while his bad characters allow themselves to become corrupt. Choice is the key. However, we see clearly that all of them have reasons (if not excuses) for what they have become.<br />Now... Read, read, read!
0142004235|5.0|This book was so good that I couldn't sleep until I had finished it.  Cathy Ames is a delicious character who also kept me up at night thinking about the things she had done.  I think she is my favorite character feom any book.
0064407667|5.0|A charming little book! I read it in one sitting, and it wasn't at all what I expected. For one thing, these have been sold along side the Harry Potter books and this one, at least, had no magic in it. On the contrary, it was very down-to-earth. The children's solutions to their problems did not seem particularly far-fetched. Although the books are \\"dark\\" in some ways, they do not teach a helpless outlook. On the contrary, the kids usually solves their problems by either reading books (law books, in this case) or by using their minds to come up with technological solutions. Their plans are frequently thwarted, and they have to start over again, but they don't give up.<br />The plot is simple: three orphaned kids must deal with a malevolent guardian who's after their money. The fun part is the witty, entertaining prose. My only criticism is that frequent explanations of word meanings get old. As a child, I derived most of my word definitions from context and figured things out quite neatly. This author stops the dialogue to define words, which is cute the first few times and gets a little annoying towards the end. However, this is a children's book, and perhaps children like that sort of thing. At any rate, I will definitely read the second one.
B00008PC2O|5.0|FUN FUN FUN.  Thats what I think when I watch John Connor riding his bike from the the death ship.  When I saw this movie, I went doodoo in my pants because it was so good, especially the part where Arnold kills Sarah Connor.  He appears there and it is like \\"WHOA BUDDY!  GET SOME CLOTHES ON NOW OR YOUR GOING TO BLOW YOURE COVER!\\"  I liked it when he chased John on a tractor. It was loads of fun, and poop in ,my pants.  Just kidding, I was wearing shorts.  Just kidding, i didnt poop.  but seriously Die Hard is a good movie and without candy land i don't know what board game we would be playing.  Good night Wisconsin.  I give this movie 3 thumbs up.
B00005YW4H|1.0|If you think back to BEFORE Norah Jones took all those Grammy's...no one knew who she was!!  Song of the year?!...um..no.  Yes she has a little bit of talent, but I find her to be extremely boring.  These are the kind of songs that you can't wait for to end.  She exemplifies no vocal range and the strength of her voice is that of a medicore vocalist.  Don't waste your money.  Go for something more like Celine Dion or Clay Aiken.
B000089RVX|5.0|As a grandmother of three I have to admit it takes  LOT to impress me these days -- my normal musical genres of choice include Allison Krauss and Enya.  But after hearing two songs on the radio by Evanescence, \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" I just had to buy the CD!  It turns out, I love every single song on this CD! Rarely do artists give this generously of themselves! They are simply incredible, amazing, breathtaking and stunning!  There really aren't enough adjectives to describe them.  Amy Lee reminds me of a heavy metal version of Enya.  They somehow manage to blend virtually every type of music, heavy metal, rock, rap, classical, and even a hint of gregorian chants (at the end of Whisper) in an incredibly fresh new sound which just carries you away and won't let you go!!!  I saw them perform tonight on \\"Pepsi Splash\\" and I was just amazed at how young they are to be so musically mature and talented.  My husband is a heavy metal fan and he has been totally impressed by them, also.  It's really hard to pick a favorite song since I love them all -- but besides \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life\\" I really like \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Imaginary\\" -- I just love the way the two songs blend into each other so seamlessly.  This is a CD you can't play quietly -- you have to play it as LOUD as you can stand it.  Just incredible!!  Just be careful if you try to sing along -- you'll have a sore throat for hours afterward!
B00008OWZC|5.0|The Heartbreaker of Zeppelin's very formidable album collection has always been the lack of a stellar live album. The band's few live releases never seemed to quench their fan's thirst, BBC sessions failed to capture the band at its peak and the The Song Remains the Same is compelling, but sparse. Fortunately, this album alleviates all such concerns. The album captures the band at its highest point of rock n roll bliss. From the rip roaring psychedelia of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; to the flower power hippie vibe of &quot;Going to California&quot;. The musical conversation that goes on between these four fantastic musicians is at times cosmic. On a 25 minute &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; Jimmy Paige goes from torturing his guitar with a violin bow to a surprisingly tight James Brown esque funk groove. And the band follows, never stumbling or slipping. That fact alone is what made Led Zeppelin quite possibly the greatest rock band of all time. Whereever the music led them they all seemed to stay on the same solitary beam of electricity, a beam so powerful that it could never be stay between just four musicians, and so it roars out and permeates the audience,whther they're in the crowd or in their living room. It gets inside you and it will put chills down youre spine, and in the end, youll love it.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I found the different versions of the movie and the making of it great.  The kids loved the interactive games..
B000002BBY|3.0|Back in the mid to late nineties Oasis were pop rock superstars. The bands sound hinged of course on songwriter Liam Gallagher's quest for the perfect pop song, sometimes he gets close to striking gold. \\"Wonderwall\\", even for its cheesy retro sound is still infectious, and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" has a melody that is utterly unforgettable. Unfortunately, the bands love of sixties pop can strip their sound of any personality.  So while the album may have its moments you can't really call Oasis a great rock band, what you could call them is a great tribute band.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Its an ok cd.  Im not too wild about it.. It could have been better...There isnt enough video on the enhanced cd..
6305205620|5.0|When I first bought this I was a little skeptical. I was blown away with the 5.1 dobly digital sound, the energy the band gave off, and the set list. Kirk Hammet was flawless, Lars was came with so much power, even though I don't like him anymore, Jason Newstead played a major role, and James of course left the crowd screaming for more and more. I would recommend this to any Metallica fan.
B0000035E7|4.0|Its pretty good for a first cd.  Some of the songs are kinda edgy and raw.  But i think that makes for a good cd..
B00008X5J1|5.0|I didn't bother to see this film in the theaters because of all the hype. Then I watched it on VHS- twice. I love this thing!<br />I've never seen a film that comes closer to catching the true 19th century urban reality. Sure, there are a few historical liberties taken, but I don't care. The director got the atmosphere of 19th century criminal and working class life right. I was immediately reminded that this was the raw, wild New York that Whitman knew. Sure, this is set in the Five Points in New York, but it also gives an insight into any number of other places from Chicago to the Barbary Coast.<br />Comes right down to it, you don't have to care about history at all to appreciate this film. Have you ever hung around low, dangerous dives where you were taking your life into your hands? Ever rubbed elbows with thiefs, murderers, or worse? Ever walked streets or allys where the cops won't even go- with only a blade in your pocket and a prayer on your lips? Ever faced cold steel without flinching or looking away? Ever been in a situation where the blood didn't count and the pain didn't matter? Some things just don't change.<br />The last New York film that I liked this much was Last Exit To Brooklyn.
B00005JKDR|5.0|If you love Billy Crystal or John Goodman this is the movie for you.  Billy Crystal is Mike and he is so funny as the second banana in the movie not to be outdone by his furry and funny counterpart Sully (goodman).  I think you will enjoy this movie right along with the kids..
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Things have changed a bit for the band but they still got it<br />it takes a few spins but it grows on you.if you like fleetwood mac you will like it.
B00005JL95|5.0|My kids loved it.  Its all of the above.  Cute, funny, sad and interesting.  They got a kick out of stitch and his crazy antics..
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is one of THE BEST movies I have EVER seen, but then again, I'm a sap for \\"Capra corn,\\" the derisive term given to the works of Frank Capra, who gave us such cinematic gems as \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" and \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\\" \\"The Majestic\\" is truly \\"Capra-esque\\" in the best sense of the term.<br />For starters, in this movie, Jim Carrey proves that he can REALLY act and not just be a clown. (Who knew?) The set decoration and costuming are truly evocative of the early '50s, and the story is good old-fashioned 1950's Americana, but within the sobering backdrop of the McCarthy hearings on un-American activities -- the Commie witch hunt which involved so many in Hollywood, and in which our hero becomes involved because of his Hollywood ties.<br />The supporting cast is equally terrific, especially Martin Landau, who believes that Carrey's character is his son, to whom Carrey's character bears a striking resemblance, who was believed lost in WW2. When Carrey's character sees that his presence gives the old man a new zest for life, he genially goes along with the ruse. The old man is so energized, that he takes on, along with Carrey and the townsfolk, the enormous task of refurbishing the dilapidated movie theatre, \\"The Majestic,\\" and the revitalization of the old movie house revitalizes the whole town.<br />If you're as big a sucker for old-fashioned, all-American cinematic sentiment as I am, believe me, you will NOT be disappointed with \\"The Majestic.\\" Among the special features on the DVD is an interesting historical capsule background about the McCarthy hearings.
B000002U82|5.0|On one level, this album could be considered concept rock at its best. On another, it's slick, psychadelic, mind warping music. No matter what level one approaches this album from, there is no denying that this is Pink Floyd at their best. Before the overly bloated corporate rock that would become their trademark, there was DSOTM, a concept album that mixed psychadelic moods with highly stylized production and pulled the whole thing off extremely well. Many of the songs are well known, such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;, and have stood the test of time for the simple reason that they are great. THe production is first rate (considering that the band worked with analog synthsizers and other equipment and still manage such a big sound), contemplative lyrics, and a mood that takes the listener to new dimensions.
B00005NRO3|4.0|Okay, so it's not scary compared to RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD or CREEPSHOW, or even the original SCREAM, but it's still better then most horror movies in many ways. The movie has a strong realistic vibe to it, and although not as atmospheric or gory as part 1, it has a better plot, more suspects, cat fights, SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR (Buffy the vampire slayer, I know) gets killed off! Yes! Plus, there is a truly scary car sequence and the end was quite the shocker! The killer's were obvious, but nobody suspects them because they're too obvious. The scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar was a tacky time filler, but it scared me a little the first time I saw it. I think that SCREAM 2 was worth the 15.99 on VHS, and the 20 bucks I just paid for the DVD, the movie is good, and although part 1 is better on most levels, it sure is a very good, suspenseful and new sequel that uses it's own witt to seperate it from the 1996 blockbuster original.
B000002J09|5.0|There is not much else that needs to be said about Led Zep IV. This is one of those essential rock and roll albums that every music lover should own. Aside from the mastery that is &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, there are several other phenomial tracks on this album that demonstrate the genius that was Led Zepellin at their best. One of the less heralded, but highly haunting songs to check out is &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, with Robert Plant's haunting vocals over a chilling guitar riff (literary buffs who listen carefully will notice that the lyrics of the song actually detail one of the major battles in JRR Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot;). Without a doubt, this is an essential album that every music lover should have in their collection!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I rented this movie and watched it five times in a row, and I could watch it again. There are not many movies that would stand that kind of close scrutiny, according to me. I also agree with the above about Catcher in the Rye and the Oscar-nominations. Buy it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved this movie!  Original, fantastic writing, awesome animation/graphics!  It's hilarious, perfectly cast, and the DVD has some awesome special features, including a special dance party scene with all the characters and commentary by the 'stars.'  There's not a lot else I can say that hasn't been said in the tons of other reviews this movie has received.  It's wonderful - I would recommend it to anyone.  Kids will love it, and it's got humor for adults as well.  Just phenominal!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I just have to say that although this movie portrays drug-addiction, it's a movie also about peoples inabilities to put human relationships (love, compassion, etc.) in front of consumerism and mind numbing tv/drugs, etc. A very thought provoking, beautiful and horrifying film absolutely worth watching.
0894803123|5.0|This book is amazing!  I have a fetish for Ben and Jerry's ice cream - so when I bought myself an ice cream maker I got this book to go along with it.  It's easy to understand and has TONS of Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipes in it.  Definitely recommend to anyone, and I have bought it for several people as gifts!  So far, everyone loves it. :D
B00009V7RF|5.0|I think that this CD is about peace and hapiness.  They sound like a very peaceful group trying to stop hate and terroism.  \\"Boogie to Be\\" is a crazy song with Fergi's solo unbeatable.  She has the most amazing voice to go along with her great look.  I like very single track with the exception of \\"Labor Day\\".  The best track is \\"Fly Away\\".  Fergi' blows that track out of house.  This ablum is just a symbol of what hip-hop should be: positive and uplifing rather that degrading and violent.
B00000K19E|5.0|I didn't know what to expect going in to this movie.  I had heard lots of good things about it, but most people couldn't explain the storyline in a way I could understand.  I finally saw it and was just blown away by the first scene alone (maybe I am easily entertained?).  The Trinity fight scene in the beginning is just a great start to a fantastic movie.<br />The storyline is intriguing, though it's difficult to understand completely the first time.  I've since seen the movie several times and finally understand it better.  The visual effects are incredible, especially with the creation of &quot;bullet-time.&quot;  The DVD is pretty good, though I haven't checked out most of the special features yet.  Well worth buying, IMHO!
6302054443|4.0|I first saw this one on public television many years ago and it's one that I've wanted for my video collection for some time. For students of horror film, it is a MUST SEE. A true classic! For fans of vampire/Dracula lore, you might be a little disappointed, but it is still the PIONEER of all vampire films.<br />The director was sued for copyright by Bram Stoker's widow and most copies of the film were destroyed. Thankfully, enough survived intact so that we can view it today. The basic storyline from Stoker is intact, but there are a few changes that make this film worth viewing. For example, the time frame is set in the year 1838, rather than 1890 as in the Stoker novel. The Harkers live in Bremen Germany, rather than England.<br />In this film, the vampire does not have any wives which could have been effective. The rats that accompanied Nosferatu played a larger part in this film than in others, including a bit of low comedy when a warehouse worker is bitten on the foot. A rotund Reinfield capers about in a cartoonish manner,leering and sneering but this makes him seem all the MORE demented. The obligatory ride to the castle is RAPID to say the least, almost a \\"Keystone Kop\\" pace which makes it unintentionally funny. One sequence was done in an almost \\"X-ray\\" effect which could have been used more often. But the most eerie effect is Nosferatu's appearance. Lean and bald, with a mishapen skull and a lurching walk. His hands look like claws and his rat-like ears, a hooked nose, hollow eyes and sunken cheeks make a real impact. When he rises from his coffin, he's as rigid as a board. Unfortunatly, Harker comes across as a scatterbrained oaf and is totally useless in protecting Nina (Yes they changed her name)from the vampire. One scene in the castle has Harker childishly pulling a sheet over his head to protect himself from the approaching vampire. I was also disappointed by the limited part played by Van Helsing, Lucy Westerna and Jack Seward. Still, this tape is well worth having.The edition I bought came from Republic Studios and it has a HORRIBLE SOUNDTRACK. I MUTE IT.th having.The edition I bought came from Republic Studios and it has a HORRIBLE SOUNDTRACK. I MUTE IT.
B00000IQC8|2.0|Sorry. I did not like this movie at all. Most of the dialogue sounded very scripted and contrived... reminded me of a high school play. Since when do customers go into a store and say 'a pack of cigarettes, please'. Quite frankly, I was bored through most of this film.  I realize that this movie was made on a shoestring budget but the camera work was pretty lousy like there was a single camera used or something. Probably the only redeeming value of the movie is the modern-ish soundtrack and the fact that it was filmed in black and white.

B00008DDXL|4.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is much darker and more insidious in nature than 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  This is not meant as a criticism; indeed, it is partly due to the undercurrent of menace, that this second filmic journey into the wizarding world surpasses its predecessor in terms of quality, enjoyment and heart-in-your-mouth scares.  While it is funny and light-hearted in places, it doesn't gloss over the unpleasant aspects of life, and deals with racism in particular. <br />It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but owing to a blocked up wizarding portal, a flying Ford Anglia, and a whomping willow, the beginning of the term is far from ideal.  Then Harry begins to hear voices in the walls of the school; voices that no one else is aware of.  It would seem that the fabled Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and that the horror residing within has been unleashed upon the students.<br />It is nice to see how the young actors have developed their roles, although Ron's (Rupert Grint) slightly overdone comedic style would perhaps be more suited to stage performance.  The real stars of the film however, are not the actors, but the wonderful and intricately detailed sets.  From Hogwarts' gothic cathedral, to the glorious muddle of the Weasley household (complete with self-washing dishes and self-knitting jumpers), to the grime and nastiness of Knockturn Alley, the built sets are far more impressive than the CGI wizardry.   In particular, the Quidditch match takes far too long and isn't really all that exciting.  Having said that though, the computer-animated outsize spider sequence will likely scare the socks off small children, and probably even some parents as well!

0140186409|4.0|Grapes of Wrath may look daunting at first but it, like most Steinbeck, is very easy reading and well worth the read.  The book is one of the major landmarks of American Literature and has permeated our entire culture and served as the voice of those striving to move west during the Dust Bowl and, even more so, the American spirit. Preacher Casey and Tom Joad have become classic characters and have even been the subject of many songs by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Bruce Springsteen.<br />When you're reading this you're a piece of American history at its finest and most tragic. Steinbeck paints a wonderful picture of the human condition against the back drop of one of the most interesting, exciting, yet tragic times of American history. If you're looking for a long, easy read pick Grapes of Wrath over Harry Potter and you'll certainly get your reward at the end.

YEARS LATER, HE ESCAPES AND GOES AFTER HIS OTHER SISTER [JAMIE LEE CURTIS]. THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MASTERPIECE. THIS FILM LAUNCHED THE CAREERS OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS AND FILM DIRECTOR JOHN CARPENTER. DONALD PLEASEANCE [R.I.P.] GIVES HIS FINEST PERFORMANCE OF HIS CAREER AS DR. LOOMIS, THE MAN WHO TRIES TO STOP MICHAEL FROM GOING ON HIS KILLING SPREE AND MURDERING HIS SISTER. THIS IS A REALLY GREAT FILM. RIGHT NEXT TO ''PSYCHO'', THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME. I'D RECCOMEND THIS TO ANY MOVIE BUFF. FOLLOWED BY SEVEN SEQUELS.
B000002J09|5.0|What can I say except that this Led Zepellin album rocks? If you're a LZ fan at all, you need it. My three favorite songs Black Dog, Misty Mountain Top and Stairway to Heaven are all on this album. For fans of this band, it doesn't get much better than this. I highly recommend it as a great album filled with tracks you can listen to any time and not easily grow tired of.

IN THIS ONE; MICHAEL RETURNS 20 YEARS LATER TO FINISH OFF HIS SISTER [JAMIE LEE CURTIS], WHO IS NOW A TEACHER AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA, AND HAS A SON [JOSH HARTNETT]. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY THRILLING, ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. ONLY MAJOR FLAW; CASTING LL COOL J. LL HAS NO PURPOSE IN THIS MOVIE. THIS IS THE BEST SEQUEL THAT ''HALLOWEEN'' HAS TO OFFER. AND THE PLOT SEEMS TO IGNORE ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED IN HALLOWEEN 3-6. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS MOVIE IS GREAT AND IT'S UP THERE WITH THE ORIGINAL.
B0000931OG|5.0|I eagerly awaited the release of this album, and I was not disappointed. In my opinion, this album mixes the softer sound of &quot;13&quot; with the harder sounds of their self-titled album. While I admit that I enjoy their early 90's pop albums (I own every Blur album) I enjoy this new &quot;grown-up&quot; sound that includes Moroccan music and has a more ethnic flavor to it. It is sad that Coxon has left the band, but they are doing fine without him. I think this album has something to satisfy every Blur fan.

SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE ACTIVE THAN WHAT SHE WAS. ANYWAY, THIS SEQUEL MANAGES TO BE ALRIGHT. THIS MIGHT NOT BE AS MEMORABLE AS HALLOWEEN 1, BUT IT'S FUN FOR HORROR FANS AND MOVIE FANS IN GENERAL.
0783222955|5.0|This movie is very good.  I'm 16 and a fan of Gregory Peck and I loved this movie.  I recommend the book first because this movie cannot even compare to the novel.

B000002AH9|5.0|The ultimate torch album of all time! Ray Ellis wrote similar arrangements for Pop singers around the same time (Connie Francis, Jerri Adams, etc.), but Billie Holiday's life-ravaged voice and unusual style makes this recording 'other-worldly'. The Lady loved strings, and they are sawing away in abundance, along with great soloists like Urbie Green on trombone, and ethereal voices sounding like they're eminating from the next room. This recording goes beyond jazz &amp; is certainly not 'easy listening': it's a strange and emotional experience that isn't easily forgotten, thanks to the wondrous talents of Lady Day and Mr. Ellis.

0393057658|4.0|If you are a so-called &quot;casual&quot; baseball fan, maybe one who watches a couple of games a week on television, or even goes to a game every now and then, and you've picked up most or all of your insight into the game by listening to broadcasters and watching ESPN, then this book will really be quite interesting.  If you've read everything ever written by Bill James, play in three different fantasy leagues, and scour the web daily for every little  shred of information you can find, then Moneyball will be significantly less worth while.  Whatever the case, it is still a fine read, well written and engaging, that introduces you to a memorable group of people working hard at solving the game we all love so much, even if it is a short book and very light on the math that should be there to help back its claims.<br />The central idea behind the success of the Oakland Athletics, as presented in Moneyball, is that it is possible to accurately quantify the contributions of ballplayers to their teams and by using statistical analysis, find value where the market doesn't believe there to be any.  I personally found the idea of using hard, mathematical analysis over gut feeling and village wisdom to make baseball decisions quite appealing.  I don't know that I agree with everything in the book and everything about the way the A's approach baseball, but they've got a lot of numbers and wins to back up their approach.  No matter what you think personally of their philosophy or their methods, it is worth your time to learn something about them if you are a baseball fan.<br />In the end, Moneyball is one of those rare sports books that makes you watch (and play) the game differently.  It has helped me understand a lot of recent developments in baseball (like why the Toronto Blue Jays never bunt and why the Boston Red Sox hired Theo Epstein as their GM) and it was fun to read as well.  I wish it had contained an appendix with a little more on how exactly people simulate a baseball season and quantify the value of the players numerically, but I can understand if the A's either didn't want to share any sort of really specific information on that or if the author just didn't want to bother with learning the math he'd need to know to make that portion of the book understandable for his average reader.  I also wish the book had been a little longer.

B00006LHYC|5.0|I heard the current single &quot;Surrender&quot; on MTV and fell instantly in love with Laura's voice.<br />This album is a collection of both beautiful ballads such as the gorgeous &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;It's Not Goodbye&quot; and uptempo numbers like &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;Love Comes from the Inside&quot;.<br />Laura's voice is both emotional and strong and can definitely be compared to the likes of Celine Dion and Lara Fabian. <br />I doubt it will get much attention from Radio One listeners in the UK but if I were Laura, I'd take this as a compliment!<br />Lets hope that my faith in the UK public is restored and that they &quot;Surrender&quot; to Laura's beautiful voice and first English language album ASAP!
6300182266|5.0|'There are those who believe<br />that life here began out there...'<br />Thus begins the tale of Battlestar Galactica, full of meaning and hope and mystical importance.<br />Okay, enough theology for the moment.<br />Or, maybe not. This movie (actually a cut-up version of the pilot for the television series) definitely has theological undercurrents. It is the fight between good and evil. It is a wandering in the desert (of space) looking for the promised land. It is about hope and humanity, sensitivity and courage.<br />And, as a 12 year old (when I first saw it) I of course understood none of this. I merely loved the special effects in my own home (as opposed to the Star Wars which required payment at the movie theatre), the characters and the technology. I was amazed that every computer on the bridge set of the Galactica actually worked.<br />Today I'm amazed that the computer on which I'm typing this review has more power than all those computers combined!<br />The story is basic. Ambush in space, a quickly-organised escape from the evil mechanical Cylons (who both symbolise the terrors of technology as well as of autocratic rule--remember the Cold War?), a daring journey, and finally a hope. Unfortunately the series became a wandering in the desert with little hope for reaching the promised land, and in television-series timelines and lifelines, this just wasn't acceptable.<br />In addition to this film, there are about a dozen videos available with episodes from the rest of the television series. It is frustrating that not all of them are available, so to watch them in sequence leaves some gaps. There are enough dedicated fans who would purchase these videos should they be made available (as is evidenced by the amount of BG 'junk' being auctioned at ebay and other such places).<br />The series was fated only to last one year, due to high costs (a million an episode may be a standard ER actor's salary, but back then it was big bucks even in Hollywood), a slumping viewership (which in retrospect was never as small as reported), and an overall lack of direction. The journey was just taking too long for the era of instant gratification.<br />There was a short-lived attempt to revitalise BG with Galactica 1980, but due to underfunding, choppy stories and the absence of several more popular regulars from the preceding series, it failed dramatically. There is a chopped-up edited version of one of those episodes available too -- do yourself a favour and fly light speed away from this one.<br />But do get the original movie, the best of the best episodes.g viewership (which in retrospect was never as small as reported), and an overall lack of direction.

6305252521|4.0|The film deals with the human \\"need\\" to know what is going on behind someone elses curtains. <BR>The plot centers around a man named Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey. Right from his beginnings (meaning his birth) he has been the subject of a TV show in which everyone he knows is not really who he thinks they are, but merely actors playing a role. He alone is unaware of this fact. He is broadcasted live and with an audience all around the world. The frightening thing about it is the fact that it worked perfectly for over 30 years, without the notice of its star. Nevertheless he someday discovers that something is happening around him, that certain things seem planned or fake.  Truman has the courage to encounter the truth with knowing that his world could shatter. That is why I think it is not only the producers ambition to reveal what is possible in times of Reality TV, he also wants to show that it is our (the viewers) choice to watch it and support it or to go back to our own lives and experience them. <br />Jim Carrey gives an excellent debut in non-comedian acting and makes the film worth looking.
B000002BBY|5.0|When Oasis released their album \\"Definitely Maybe\\" in 1994, no one thought that one year later, they would become the most significant and important British band since the Beatles. 1995 was a whirlwind year for Oasis, and their release of the album \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory\\" was the focal point. This is more than an album - it's part of 90's popular culture. A true classic that spoke to a whole generation of fat and lazy middle-aged men. The album sold by the truck load - in the UK, it is the second biggest selling record of all time, with only the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" standing in its way. The songs on this album are classics - iconic songs that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />The album starts with the infectious \\"Hello.\\" Crunching guitar solos and brilliant vocals make this an excellent opener - it's short, but sweet. The song starts with the tune of \\"Wonderwall,\\" but quickly changes to this all-out rock anthem. \\"Roll With It\\" was a big hit for the boys in August 1995, when the song peaked at No.2 in the UK. It has a brilliant melody, and the strained vocals from Liam Gallagher enhance the song's quality. Up next we have two undeniable classics. Firstly, \\"Wonderwall\\" has to be one of the greatest songs ever written. Amazingly, the song didn't make No.1, but charted at No.2 in the UK. This was the anthem that millions sung in 1995, and was played on the radio literally millions of times. \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" is even more of an iconic classic. It gave the boys their second UK No.1 hit in the UK in March 1996, and pushed sales of this album even further beyond what seemed possible. The wonderful similarity of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" at the beginning is genius. Everything about the song is perfect - vocals, lyrics, guitar, piano, drums. It's the works.<br /><br />\\"Hey Now!\\" is one of my favourites on the album. A lot of people dislike this song for reasons I really cannot see, because everything about it is perfect. The guitars and the drums are amazing, and the vocal arrangement is particularly interesting. A short interlude follows, before we move on to the amazing \\"Some Might Say.\\" This wonderful classic gave Oasis their first UK No.1 hit single in May 1995. Once again, wonderful guitar melodies are blended with wonderful vocals. The lyrics are well written, but in a way that encompasses all those who listen to it. \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is the album's true chill out track. The boys release wonderful harmonies and beautiful melodies that relax the listener. A true masterpiece, said to be influenced by the Verve's Richard Ashcroft.<br /><br />\\"She's Electric\\" is one of Oasis' few humorous songs. The lyrics are wonderful, and very ironic of life amongst a jilted generation of slobs. It's the song you heard on the radio all the time as a teenager, and knew all the lyrics off by heart. \\"Morning Glory,\\" the album's title track, is a song that will stay in your head for years to come - possibly all your life. More wonderful guitar solos, and marvellous lyrics make for another album highlight. A song that reveals a dirty side to the band. Another short instrumental interlude follows, which is followed by the epic finale \\"Champagne Supernova.\\" This is one of the most beautiful and memorable songs that Oasis ever had the opportunity to churn out. Wonderful lyrics, excellent vocals and excellent melodies are all encased in seven and a half minutes of pure Britpop class.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This is not only an essential album for anyone interested in Oasis, but an essential album for those who witnessed the 1990's - and the impact that this band had on the music scene. I was just eight years old at the time this CD was released, but I still remember all the songs that played endlessly on the radio for years. I hated them as a band but there's no denying that these songs are amazing. Liam's attitude is a bit vulgar and over-the-top, but that's all part of their image. A handful of critics once said that Oasis were more important than the Beatles - I have to disagree, but they're pretty damn close!he Beatles - I have to disagree, but they're pretty damn close!
B000002JSN|5.0|It's a shame that thier career came to a close after this release (Damn Disco) but it will be one of the very fondest albums that we as Led Zepplin fans will remember dearly. The fact that after the release of this album one of the band members passed away, this event was truly one of the biggest losses that the Music industry will ever suffer. I may only be 15 but I do tip my hat to rock legends such as Led Zeppelin, Thier music is much more enjoyable to listen to (Unlike The Garbage of today [NOTE: I'M NOT BASHING TODAY'S ROCK I JUST DON'T CARE FOR IT), the reason I enjoy Classic Rock so much is the fact that music actually had meaning, Thier was none of this yelling or shoting about mutilating a person. Led Zepplin, April Wine, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, Pink Floyd, The Band, etc. will always be some of the greatest song writers that were ever on this earth and that were ever heard, this album is a must buy, and will always remain very close to me.
0226264211|5.0|Occasionally one stumbles upon a work that is truly enlightening and not only thought provoking, but thought changing. This book belongs to that highest category of literature. Friedman, a Nobel Prize laureate, lays out a concise explanation of the basic market forces that control markets and then uses those principles to support his classical liberal ideals. For one who's mind is open, Friedman's exposition can radically change your view of the world. People have a tendency to make erroneous assumptions about economics(like the idea that raising the minimum wage will help workers) that are totally wrongheaded(raising minimum wage actually causes employers to hire fewer people), though seemingly supported by common sense. Capitalism and Freedom will set you on the right track to understanding how things truly work. Most importantly though, Friedman explains how capitalism and freedom are irrevocably linked and that one necessitates  the other. This is a must read for anyone serious about politics, even if you don't agree with it wholeheartedly it gives you a perspective from where libertarians are coming from.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead must be simply the best band in the world.  They are not afraid to re-invent themselves with every new album.  Unlike most bands who simply use the same old formula from previous albums, Radiohead does not seem to care whether their most recent effort will be rewarded/praised by the listening public/media.  This is a great thing.  They do not limit themselves within a small framework of acceptable formulas.  Each album is genuinely different from the previous album (with perhaps an exception to Kid A and Amnesiac, which were produced at virtually the same time).<BR>Hail To The Thief seemed to me to be the most \\"listener-friendly\\" album.  Most Radiohead albums take me four or five listens before I am really sucked in.  Hail To The Thief grabbed me right away.  I like all the tracks very much, especially 2+2=5, Drunken Punch-up At A Wedding, and Where I End And You Begin.  I do, however, feel O.K. Computer remains their finest work to date.  I will continue to listen to Radiohead until the day I die.  Most albums and bands I tire of eventually, not Radiohead.  I always look forward to their next album.  I am eagerly awaiting Radiohead's Auburn, WA show, which I'll be attending!

I laughed out loud, reading about the stern French (so they really can be!), the friendly Northern people etc etc. Sometimes people are ridiculed in a very funny way that even Europeans themselves can laugh about. Nobody writes as witty and funny about travel as Bill Bryson. If you have never read one of his books before, this one is very good to start with and it also teaches you a lot of nice dinner-party facts about my strange continent....
B00006JDS4|5.0|Surely you've heard the hype, but does this film live up to its reputation? Well that depends on whether you are expecting a sleazy trashy exploitation flick or a shocking cult classic. <br />Is it a good movie? By conventional standards like budget, dramatic acting, star power ect, this film is a dismal failure, a cheap exploitation flick nothing more many will tell you. Most people would read the title and just assume it's bad. But really this film is brilliantly directed, does it matter how much it cost to make? Is it still an exploitation flick when the director married the actress who is being 'exploited'? Why is it that films like this which use more naturalistic acting as opposed to dramatic acting are automatically classed as being poorly acted? Weren't the cast convincingly real especially Camille Keaton with her brave and harrowing performance? So what if everyone involved never went on to bigger projects or never appeared in any other films, this film will live in infamy forever and the stunningly beautiful Camille Keaton is already an immortal icon in cult horror. If it was better known under the more noble title \\"Day of the Woman\\" and not \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" (which is about as campy as titles \\"Surf Nazis Must Die\\" and \\"Nude for Satan\\") would it be treated more seriously. <br />The real question isn't whether this is a good moive, but is this good cinema? Love it or hate it, how can you deny the power of a film that has such an effect on it's audience. The realism in the rape scenes, the lack of any musical score and voyeuristic yet artistic camera work deliver the kind of shear visceral power that big budget movies these days can only dream of possessing. So yes, this is undeniably spectacular cinema. <br />Why do people hate it? Roger Ebert would have you believe it's sick and pure garbage. However read his initial review and you will find he largely justifies his views by reactions from nonthinking audience members which he found appalling and notwhat was happening on screen. Still there is no shortage of people who call this film sick. Even more sad is how some people out there want to censor or ban this film (book burning religious zealots no doubt) just check, theres like two yahoo groups dedicated to this childish cause (pathetic though as they only have about a dozen members between them). This film is not made to be an enjoyable viewing experience, it pulls no punches, just because you don't like it does that mean it must be sick? Rape is a horrible crime, would it be more acceptable to portray it any other way? <br />What would posses someone to make such a film? Meir Zarchi wrote and directed the film after a real life encounter with a rape victim who he took to a police station (in retrospect he admits she should have gone to the hospital) and the cops were unsympathetic. This genuine horror he saw which existed in the real world which doesn't require werewolves or zombies, is the inspiration for the film. The revenge half of the film obviously an expression of the rage he felt at how the victim was treated, in the real world justice is rarely served. He uses in your face realism to get his message across. Just because his story is simple doesn't mean it's unintelligent. He dodges the one dimensional rapist stereotypes seen in other movies early on by humanising them with crude but still humorous personalities, one even has a family, the message: villains are real people too not comic book characters. One rapist while pleading pathetically tells Jennifer she asked for it by he way she walks and dresses, a damning criticism of some real life attitudes which state women are themselves to blame if they are attacked. The sequence of Jennifer after the attack is brilliant in displaying the traumatic detachment and loss of self suffered by real victims. It's the inclusion and excellent handling of the small details that elevate this movie beyond its low budget limits. <br />Why would anybody like this film? I personally admire powerful films, films that are unique whether they are shocking or thought provoking. One reviewer complained that the violence wasn't disturbing in comparison to some other films, hey if you have seen Dead/Alive like you claim (although I own and prefer the uncut version called Braindead) then you must know that the most goriest movie ever is a comedy. The gore isn't the real focus of this film anyway. I own uncut copies of Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun, Cannibal Ferox, Anthropophagous, Flowers of Flesh and Blood and just about every notorious gore film out there. The only gore films more disturbing than ISOYG are Cannibal Holocaust and Men Behind the Sun, simply because like ISOYG these films are made by talented directors. Besides how could any amount of gore be disturbing when you want Jennifer to carry out her vendetta?<br />So does it live up to the hype? This film is something you experience not just another movie. It's definitely a well deserved cult classic and one of the original cornerstones of the video nasties. While the more jaded viewer might not find it as disturbing as some, this is still a film you won't soon forget. The Millennium Edition DVD is outstanding, the film has never looked better and you get two excellent commentary tracks. It's a shame they didn't get any input from Camille Keaton when putting the extras together on this DVD, but you can't have it all I guess. I wish I lived in the USA so I could go to a horror convention and ask Camille Keaton for her autograph. <br />Final thoughts? This is a challenging and outstanding cult masterpiece, it's a shame that this genuinely great piece of cinema is so universally misunderstood and under-rated.
B00005NG9Z|3.0|I am a huge AIC fan, and was thrilled when I saw the VHS copy of this.  I've watched it more times than I can count.  So why the 3 stars?  Something is a little goofy with the sound on the DVD, and I've heard the same complaint from other people.  The harmonies are the most affected, with Jerry completely drowning Layne out on some songs.<br />All in all, stick with the VHS copy.  It's outstanding.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Ryan Adams is amazing. This CD is stunning and so is his voice. Every song is terrific. i bought this CD weeks ago and i still listen to it constantly, its that good!
6302859204|5.0|From the very beginning of the movie it was very errie. Especially because of the fact that it was based on a true story. It had a lot of action and suspense. I know people that have had nightmares from this movie. It bothers me that they made the aliens vengeful and evil. They have no respect. In the real story the aliens were not mean. In real life I don't think aliens intend to scare people, they can't help the way their faces look. Maybe they just want to be friends with us. Anyway, it was still an excellent movie. Don't watch it at night or alone unless you want to be really scared!
630518299X|3.0|When I saw this film for the first time I didn`t have any expectations. Maybe because of this, maybe because it is really an interessting plot and film, I really liked this movie.<BR>The imagination of being watched by the world nearly every minute of your life is really crazy and not that irreal as many people think. Think of Big Brother and other reality soaps.<BR>Where will this all end? Why was only one person really against this hole project? These are questions I have now and of which I`m not sure about if there is an answer I can handle.<BR>With the help of this film Jim Carrey has proofed that he isn`t  only able to be a comediean but also a serious actor, by the way a really good one, I think.<BR>In spite of all good aspects of  this film there exist also some I dislike.<BR>For example the set was not that great and seemed really artificial and music as well wasn`t great.<BR>On the other hand I think some scenes were too exagerated!<BR>All in all a god but not great film!
0142004235|5.0|That's the first sentence of East of Eden, and it only gets better from there. This life-altering novel is much more than a retelling of the Cain and Abel story. It is a masterfully crafted depiction of the human spirit that works its way into your life before you've even realized it. Steinbeck's writing is genuine and simple, uniting plot and philosophy seamlessly throughout the book. I draw so much inspiration from the character of Lee: eloquently honest and observant with others and himself. With a little help from Oprah, East of Eden is no longer such a secret....it would be selfish of me to keep it one.
6305252521|5.0|The movie tells the story of a young man who lifes in a closed world. Since he was born cameras follow his steps  and on TV many  people watch him every day and every minute. But he don't know. Until...<BR>If you want more watch the film. <BR>I think....<BR>The Truman Show is a new generation of film. I have never seen a film like that before. It has a special kind and after you look the film you think about it and thought if that could be real some day. After the second or third look, you will notice more and more details and understand more and more. But don't think the story is complex. It's a very nice satire with many good jokes and the right quantity of  austere. <br />And if we never hear again...<BR>...good Afternoon, good evening and good night!
B0000031ZM|5.0|Rarely have I bought or heard a boxed set that could not be trimmed by at least a disc or two. Not so with Jarrett's collection of standards and a few originals taped over three nights at the famed club. There are no boring moments (not even in 26 minutes of &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;), no repetition of material, and while very accessible, the music is by no means simplistic or bland. You might say it's reminiscent of the Modern Jazz Quartet in tone. Great for jazz enthusiasts and casual listeners alike, and worth every penny!
B000002KDS|5.0|In case you just returned from Mars and don't know who Alice Cooper is here's a little background. Alice Cooper was originally the name of the band from Phoenix, Arizona whose leader was Vincent Damon Furnier, who later became Alice Cooper.<br />Furnier/Cooper may be the most prolific artist, of modern times logging some 40 albums to date and still counting. Furnier formed his first group, Earwigs, in the earley 60s, then changed to the Spiders in 1965 and later to Nazz. In 1968, after finding out that another Nazz existed, Furnier once again changed the bands name, to Alice Cooper. Rumour has it, the name came to Furnier during a ouija board session, where he was told he was the reincarnation of a 17th-century witch of the same name. After Alice Cooper signed their first record contract, four releases were made before Killer was released in 1971. Killer was a moderate seller going gold but what really started to make the band popular today was the theatrics and wild stage shows. Under Furnier's direction, Alice Cooper initiated a impressively theatrical and forceful brand of heavy metal that was designed to shock, drawing equally from horror movies and vaudeville. This probably preceded Ozzie Osbourne by at least a few years so audiences became enthralled with Alice Cooper's antics.<br />Furniers on stage persona was Alice Cooper which became his alter ego. A few years later Furnier officially change his name to Alice Cooper. Furnier only made three more albums as a member of a band. In 1975 he went solo.<br />Here is an AMG review of this very good album. My FIXATION will be discussed thereafter.<br />\\"Alice Cooper wasted little time following up the breakthrough success of 1971's Love It to Death with another album released the same year, Killer. Again, producer Bob Ezrin was on board, and helps the group solidify their heavy rock (yet wide-ranging) style even further. The band's stage show dealt with the macabre, and such disturbing tracks as \\"Dead Babies\\" and the title track fit in perfectly. Other songs were even more exceptional, such as the perennial-barnstorming concert standard \\"Under My Wheels,\\" the melodic yet gritty \\"Be My Lover,\\" and the tribute to their fallen friend Jim Morrison, \\"Desperado.\\" The long and winding \\"Halo of Flies\\" correctly hinted that the band would be tackling more complex song structures on future albums, while \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" showed that Alice Cooper hadn't completely abandoned their early garage-rock direction. With Killer, they became one of the world's top rock bands and concert attractions; it rewarded them as being among the most notorious and misunderstood entertainers, thoroughly despised by grown-ups.\\" - Greg Prato<br />MY FAVORITE SONG, \\"Halo of Flies\\"<br />At eight minutes and twenty-two seconds \\"Halo of Flies\\" may be the longest piece Alice Cooper ever did. All my favorite songs tend to be long, the shortest being five + minutes. I guess it's because the longer songs have more variety and instrumentation, which is what I like. I tend to think of vocals as another instrument, augmenting the other instruments, rather than being the center of the music. There are exceptions to this thinking when the vocals are so astounding that they almost take over the music. The emotive ramblings of Tom Eklund on In search of Truth is such an effort.<br />\\"Halo of Flies\\" is both a complex but simple straight Rock and roll piece and actually manages to create the feeling of a bunch of flies buzzing around. Starting out with first one then two twanging guitars and cymbals for thirty seconds, when the music changes slightly with the addition of distorted guitar with a fluttery sound. This sound also backs and almost mimics Furnier when he sings, starting at the 1:50 mark. The underlying beat for the song is what I would call a giddyap beat. Furniers voice is sort of a raspy yell, not smooth but serving the music very well. There is a catchy, Near East type, guitar hook used effectively throughout the number and a nice drum solo at the six minute mark. Overall it's a fast 8:22. The musicianship, while primitive, is solid, the production is average and the song is captivating.<br />It should be mentioned that, unlike many of my other review picks, this is an outstanding, old rock and roll, album, with numerous great songs. My other favorites are: \\"Desparado\\", \\"Killer\\", \\"Dead Babies\\" and \\"Under my Wheels\\"hook used effectively throughout the number and a nice drum solo at the six minute mark. Overall it's a fast 8:22. The musicianship, while primitive, is solid, the production is average and the song is captivating. <br />It should be mentioned that, unlike many of my other review picks, this is an outstanding, old rock and roll, album, with numerous great songs.

0441009425|3.0|After more-or-less neglecting mainstream science fiction for a couple of years, I picked up REVELATION SPACE both because I'd enjoyed Alastair Reynolds' short fiction and because, based on what I'd heard about it, the novel was a spiritual heir to the plot-heavy, widescreen, and irrepressibly fun space-operatic epics of Dan Simmons (HYPERION) and Vernor Vinge (A FIRE UPON THE DEEP).<br />And it almost is - but not quite.  The plot itself is fine, as far as it goes - an obsessed scientist who rules (badly) a feeble backwater colony is first deposed by his subjects and then abducted by a starship crew who need his technological expertise to cure their Captain of a strange nanotechnological disease; in return, he demands that they transport him to a strange moon that seems to hold the secret to the mysterious demise of an ancient alien civilization.  <br />This summary is hardly more than a thumbnail sketch.  The motion of the plot is, at times, as dense as the neutron star that figures prominently in the novel; and the scope is as widescreen as one could wish, careering anarchically between worlds and centuries.  But the fun, the spontaneity, is absent.  It feels like Reynolds is going through the motions, like he's reduced the modern baroque space opera to its component bits and is merely dutifully and rather joylessly reassembling them.<br />At first it's hard to pin down exactly where REVELATION SPACE falters, because so much of it works quite well.  While Reynolds, a practicing astronomer, lacks the focused, laserlike literary brilliance of a Gene Wolfe or a Michael Swanwick, neither is his prose colorless and oatmeal-bland (as happens all too often to scientists-turned-writers).  In fact, he's quite witty, and, in the tradition of British SF, his writing has an entertainingly cynical edge to it - it doesn't fall prey to the cheesy over-earnestness that afflicts many American hard-sf writers.<br />The flaw, I think, lies in the characters.  It's obvious both fromhis writing and from his public comments that Reynolds is well-versed in the history of the space opera and has concluded (correctly) that the problem with a lot of the genre's supposed classics lies in their bland, white-bread, Heinleinian \\"competent-man\\" heroes.  But Reynolds' characters are just as flimsy; it's just that he's given them motivations that are more perverse or arcane than the norm.  Like the \\"competent men\\" before them, they tend to be defined more by their disciplines (the soldier, the scientist, the engineer, the captain, et al) than by their actions and personalities. <br />REVELATION SPACE's other main affliction is one common to sf - too much exposition.  In fact, EXPOSITION SPACE is a far more accurate title, as little in the book feels like a revelation.  One of the big draws of this sort of novel is the much-discussed and ever-elusive \\"sense of wonder\\" - and while Reynolds reaches for it over and over again, stretching his story to fit bigger and bigger canvases, he murders it with the cement overshoes of needless verbiage and explication.  I think HYPERION is so fondly remembered by sf fans in part because Dan Simmons, originally a horror writer, understood that the sense of wonder is best achieved by the strange, the half-glimpsed, the dreamy and the irrational, not by the thoroughly- and conscientiously-explained.<br />REVELATION SPACE is a difficult book to form a coherent opinion about, because there's much here to like; but ultimately it falls into the category of \\"interesting failure.\\"  That said, as it's Reynolds' first novel, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, especially as the general consensus seems to be that his subsequent novels are far superior.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|First of all, let me make one thing very very clear. <BR>I got this movie. I totally get it. I love theater, am a very big theater person, and have no qualms about sitting through hours of singing and dancing in a &quot;stagey&quot; style.<BR>However, I have several large gripes with this film. <BR>I thought I was going to LOVE it after the very first Sound of Music &quot;parody&quot; sequence. I was like: &quot;I get it! This is fun!&quot; But then, I was suddenly watching Madonna music videos. I was never quite sure what I was watching. Of course, this was probably deliberate because I also got (and enjoyed, frankly) the fairy-tale illustrated 2D backdrops to the whole film, and the gorgeous, over-the-top costuming. Madonna, however, I could've easily done without.<BR>I didn't really feel bad that Nicole Kidman died at the end. It was so incredibly expected, that I didn't care about her enough to feel any emotion. Which leads me to my second gripe: flat characterization.<BR>Mostly, I hated that I wanted to see an artsy, stagey show and I was watching 80's music videos. That's the biggest thing.<BR>Ok: what did I love? I LOVED the &quot;Roxanne&quot; sequence. LOVED IT. LOVED IT. I loved most of the fairy-tale quality of the filming and staging. I did not, however, like Nicole Kidman trying to do &quot;Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend&quot;.<BR>All in all? See it. It is an experience. But don't expect the best movie ever, I did and was disappointed.

B00000K2W1|3.0|Janis Joplin had a distinctive, gravelly voice. She was the kind of woman who sang the blues and you knew that she meant it from the bottom of her heart and spirit. Unfortunately, she was taken from us far too soon.<br />What she left behind is summarized in this collection. She wails beautifully on &quot;Summertime&quot; and makes you feel her raw emotion on &quot;Piece of my Heart,&quot; but can manage to sing softly, gently and reminscently of a past love on &quot;Me and Bobby McGee.&quot;  One of the best things about her is definitely her range of emotion she could express in her music, going from volatile and crazy to sweet, soft and serene.<br />This CD is a great overview for anyone interested in hearing some of Joplin's greatest work.
B000092ZYX|5.0|One word for this album: GREAT! When I heard that Radiohead were splitting up I was sad, since I've been a fan for such a long time now. But I must say that I still don't fully grasp the Kid A and Amnesiac albums... Nevertheless, when all hope was lost for a new Radiohead album, in comes Hail to the Thief. Apparently, this album is supposed to make the bridge between OK Computer and Kid A (please correct me if I'm wrong), and it works perfectly. As for the guys, they get better with each album. A note on the final song of the album: it's just amazong! Buy it if you're a Radiohead fan. Buy it if you're not. You won't be disappointed.
0064407667|5.0|The book The Bad Begining from A Series of Unfortunate Events is a book that hooks you to keep reading on.  The book takes place in a quiet, peacful, and dull town. .

The Baudelaire children are Violet, the oldest, who makes funny inventions,  Klaus, the middle aged boy, who looks at bugs in a pool of water, and Sunny, the youngest, who bites and chews on things. <br /> The book is very depresing and that why it is funny to read.  The book is about the three children ovecome the death of their parents.  They also have to deal with the wrath of Count Olaf, who is the closest relative.  The three children were sent to live with him.  Count Olaf is a nasty guy with a run down house.  Count Olaf is mean to the children.  For example, he only gives them cold lumpy oatmeal for breakfast.  The children are in for a ride of their life.  Count Olaf wants the money that the children inherited from their parents when they died in the fire.  This book is a must read if you like good books.  A five star book.

B000002H70|5.0|The Cure's \\"Disintegration\\" is a very strong album.  Robert Smith's vocals, songs, and guitars are in top form.  The albums songs usually have a progression of sounds and heaviness that build up.  Usually there is an intro before Robert Smith starts singing.  Listeners that are into quick songs will need to be patient and try to enjoy this album.  Most of the songs are lengthy, but do not seem overly repetitive or boring at all.<br />The album has a dark feel both musically and lyrically, but I disagree with most who call this album or the Cure gothic.  The Cure just sing about life.  This includes love, happiness, sorrows, and a lot of other emotions and subjects.<br />I think the strongest tracks were the ones that were played on the radio when I was a teen.  These would be \\"Pictures of You\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"Lullaby\\",  \\"Fascination Street\\", and the title track.  They had a lot of hits from this album.  I feel that they where well deserved.<br />I also recommend \\"Bloodflowers\\" the Cure's latest cd.  This album has darker heavier music while the latter album has darker lyrics.
006092988X|3.0|I had always meant to read this book and, at age 22, I finally got around to it. Making this purchase was an excellent decision.<br />This is the heartwarming story of a little girl growing up in--where else?--Brooklyn with her older brother, her overworked mother, and her deadbeat, drunken father. It follows her over a significant period of her life, making it one of the earliest &quot;coming of age&quot; stories which focuses on a girl. You grow up with Francie and experience her heartbreak along with her in different aspects, from life in general to, at a little older, love.<br />Not only did the author do a great job of telling the story of a family, she also informs the reader about what it was like to grow up at the turn of the century in New York as a poor family. It makes the reader (or at least it did for this reader) appreciate everything that they have in light of such poverty. However, it shows that, even in such dire poverty, children can still have happy and cherished memories of their childhoods.<br />The book is a bit lengthy and does ramble on at times, but it does not fail to keep you interested and turning the pages. It is also easy reading, although it may look intimidating--I managed to get through it within a few days, and would definitely read it again. It is a great addition to anyone's library.
B00005Q45W|4.0|This new disc is fine. I don't mind the backing vocalist, she has a very good smoothe voice. The backing arrangements are spartan but they work nonetheless. Leonard doesn't really sing per se, he sort of narrates or 'talk sings', this is fine too.<BR>He has a cool sounding voice. Why nothing really bowled me over on this disc, I do have a couple of favourites: A Thousand Kisses Deep, Here It Is and By The Rivers Dark. Sound quality is very good. You either like his style or you don't, I like it but I doubt I'd buy his whole catlog.
B000002LQR|5.0|In 1991, the Red Hot Chili Peppers took their music to the next level and delivered an instant classic album with \\"Blood, Suger, Sex, Magik\\"; an album that would become one of the defining albums of the 90's.  From the politically charged opening track \\"Power of Equality\\" to the final minute long \\"They're Red Hot\\" you are thrown head first into the Peppers' world of funk, hip hop, hard rock, and punk all mixed into a blender and served with a smile.  Radio staples \\"Give it Away\\", \\"Under the Bridge\\", and \\"Breaking the Girl\\" are reasons enough to own the album, while other great tracks like \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\", \\"I Could Have Lied\\", and \\"Funky Monks\\" fully display lead singer Anthony Kiedis' vitrol fueled voice, Flea's amazing and almost demonic bass assault, John Frusciante's melodic guitar, and Chad Smith's great drumming.  The first three quarters of the album are brilliant, and while it loses some steam towards the end (like most of the Chili Peppers' albums do), one cannot deny that \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\" is a true classic and rightly puts all the bands of today who mix rap with hard rock in their deserving place as pretenders.

B000066NW0|1.0|This cd is a sad disappointment to the 3 singles that she has released (&quot;Complicatd&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, and &quot;Losing Grip&quot;). Now, I don't like to sound like someone's mom, but it sounds like Avril is just yelling her lungs out, while her band plays background music. It's absolutely atrocious. Aside from that, Avril doesn't even sound like she does on her cd. In real life, she sounds worse! If you watch the Video Music Awards 2002, she is performing and you can't hear her above her band very well. In addition to that, she sounds like she's dying or something. She is the worst person who has tried to sing since the Stone Age! Aside from most of the cd, the only good songs are her 3 singles, and that's why she released them; because they're the only good songs on her album.
0385504209|5.0|While a wonderful thriller in it's own right, the book brings modern historical research into the search for the Holy Grail to the forefront.<br />  Brown has obviously done his home work to write this book. I've read the books he lists on the mystery of Mary Magdalene, and her connection with Jesus. His portrayal of the importance of these books is magnificant.<br /><br />  Brown has woven these controversial books into a thought provoking novel. It gives the open minded person reason to think about the true history of the Christian Church, and in particular the Catholic Church.<br />  The book accurately presents the success of the early church leaders to mold the fledgling sect into what they envisioned that it should be, not necessarily what Jesus wanted people to believe.<br />  As a 32 degree Mason, I found the references to the origins of the Masonic Lodge as steming out of the Knights Templar fascinating, and very accurate.<br />  I would recommend anyone who reads this book to meditate on it's message about what is truth and what is historic fact, and read more about these subjects from unbiased history, rather than that which they are indoctrinated with in the traditional churches.<br />Dr. Ronald E.

0142004235|4.0|East of Eden by John Steinbeck captivated my interest, leaving me spellbound during many incidents.  However, I sometimes felt like a fish trying to catch a bait that was put before me and snatched away just when I wanted to take a big bite.  That is, I could almost never guess the outcome. The characters often seemed to switch positions from being the good guy to the bad guy, and perhaps that is the way of temptation, luring a good person into doing evil things. Adam should have remained pure,<br />Cathy should have had more decency but was a &quot;wolf in sheep's clothing,&quot; and Charles, though presented at first as an icon of everything that was good, all to soon does an about face being lured by his ego and loose women. The characters battle against each other and the strong forces of nature to transform resistant land of the Salinas Valley in California to a garden of splendor, all in a backdrop of the Civil War years.  Steinbeck splendidly uses his mastery of language and genuis at depicting one-of-a-kind characters to create a tale of love/hate, good/evil, trust/deception, poverty/wealth cleverly intertwined so that a second guess turns into a soured truth with a hole in it.  I highly recommend the reading of this book with its unpredictability, even though the reader may feel manipulated and deceived, just as the characters often were.
B000084T18|1.0|There are so many talented rappers out there that have substance, and intelligence, but who gets a free ride?  You guessed it 50 cent.  His success is solely due to the fact that Dre decided to pimp him for a profit.  There is one thing that is accurate about his handle, fifty cents is about how much the guy's music is worth.

B00000F566|5.0|When I watched this again recently, it dawned on me that in 2003 I was looking back on 1987 looking back on the early 60s.  In a surreal way, it is sappy, naively sexy, heart warming and complexly nostaligic.<br />I think that Jennifer Grey is stunning, as I did in 1987.  It is surprising to me that she didn't reach greater heights as a movie star.   Patrick Swayze is at his peak of sexiness here, although I clearly remember being more impressed by his sensuality in 1987.  The dancing is entertaining, but contrived.  (I can almost hear the director scream \\"action!\\" at the beginning of each dance scene.)<br />Even without the fun of the retrospective angle, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It has a moral.  It gives a glipse of a different era and a different social scene.  The good guys win.   Boy gets girl - at least momentarily.  Mom and Pop are happy with the resolution.  <br />My recommendation:  see this movie once a decade so that you can look back on looking back on looking back.  That's my plan.

B000002L7R|5.0|I bought this recording for one song: Paisley Park.  I remember hearing Paisley Park on the radio and was fascinated by the use of the calliope in the background (that organy sounding pipe thing!).  Not many people know that Paisley Park was actually the first single from this album, but it, sadly, tanked.  Another sad fact is that Paisley Park is ONLY available on this disc.  I can't believe that Warner Brothers didn't put this song at LEAST on the B-sides disc of the Greatest Hits collection.  <br />I adore Raspberry Beret and Pop Life, but have them already on the Greatest Hits discs.  Around The World In a Day rounds out my favorites on this disc.  <br />In my opinion, this recording was the &quot;last of the best&quot; of the 80s Prince we grew to love.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|My good friend Aaron first got me started on Jimi with this album, and I quickly borrowed it from him, wanting my own copy. Now, while this package is missing a few essentials, it is not at all bad (I think it's impossible for one to include everything necessary in a greatest hits set, boxsets included).<br />Now, of course you have Purple Haze, Fire, and Foxey Lady, and then you have a trip; If 6 Was 9. My personal favorite track would have to be Voodoo Child (Slight Return), but no doubt you have your own favorite.<br />Some of the (not-so popular?) songs such as Little Wing, Castles Made Of Sand, and Bold As Love are all awesome, and you even have a little treat with Star Spangled Banner, which also is featured on Live @ Woodstock, but it is still awesome, and remains a classic to this day.<br />I'd have to say that if you are just getting into Hendrix, you should get this, or Are You Experienced?, or, if you don't have enough cash for those, Smash Hits contains enough classics to suffice, but you should go with this.
B000022TSH|5.0|The film's title refers to an area of Los Angeles where private investigator J.J. Gittes (Nicholson) once served as a police officer. It also suggests the difficulties of finding one's way in unfamiliar territory. Directed by Roman Polanski who received (in absentia) an Academy Award in 2003 for his direction of The Pianist, this film seems to have multiple layers of meaning and apparent meaning. Yes, it is well within the noir tradition but it also seems to reflect so much of the social discord during the decade prior to when it was released (1974) even as it examines Los Angeles during the 1930s, amidst the Great Depression but also a time when so many accumulated vast wealth through sometimes questionable business practices. (If I recall correctly, the number of millionaires in the United States quintupled during the decade following the collapse of the stock market in 1929.) By all accounts, Noah Cross (Huston) is an immensely wealthy and power force within the city's business community. For reasons which are revealed in the film, Gittes finds himself in an adversarial relationship with Cross and has little chance of prevailing against him. Now a private investigator, Gittes is retained by Evelyn Mulwray to follow her husband Hollis whose behavior has raised questions and caused her to be concerned. Gittes' involvement with her leads to his conflicts with Cross, for reasons which neither Gittes nor we understand until much later in the film. Polanksi briefly appears in the film (an Hitchcockian touch) as the Man with a Knife...and he uses it. Throughout much of the movie, neither Gittes nor we know what's happening. Individuals as well as circumstances are not what they appear to be. It's as if Gittes and we are being toyed with...a brilliant strategy on Polanski's part to sustain interest with precise pacing while creating tensions and even conflicts whose nature evades understanding. At one point Cross tells Gittes \\"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.\\" He didn't and, at that point, neither did I.<br />Obviously, this film intrigues me, in part because it frustrates me as I must struggle (as does Gittes) to understand various relationships which may be real or imagined...both by me and by most of those involved. What's with Evelyn Mulwray? What information is she concealing? To what extent (if any) is her husband Hollis involved with Cross? What is her own relationship with Cross? Whom and what does Gittes threaten? Why? (For most of the film, he doesn't know.) I could go on and on about ambiguities. It is paradoxical that so many of its important scenes are bathed by dazzling Southern California sunshine in this prime example of  a film noir.ith, but believe me, you don't.\\" He didn't and, at that point, neither did I.<br />Obviously, this film intrigues me, in part because it frustrates me as I must struggle (as does Gittes) to understand various relationships which may be real or imagined...both by me and by most of those involved.

0142004235|4.0|Oprah got me to read this classic.  It is her first pick in the new beginning of her book club.  I really liked the book and had a hard time putting it down once I started it.  It really made me think about what influences we have on the way a child can end up with the background that Caleb and Aron had. Sad how Cathy was a influence without even raising her boys. Lee was the only good role model and stable enough to keep the family together.

B00000099Y|5.0|This album is great on so many levels, that I feel that I must say something to the nay-sayers of this album; If you do not like it, do not listen to it, if it doesn't appeal to you, don't bother with it, if you have no interest in any but 2 songs on an album, don't buy it, if you are going to do everything BUT praise an album, don't review it! Stop cluttering the space with 1-2-3-and 4 star reviews, and give it what it deserves; a 5!<br />Now that I got that off my chest, this is really a terrific album, which has been stated so many times before by so many people before me, that I don't think I should have to go into the track analysis, if you will.<br />However, I must warn you, if Lateralus is the only Tool album you have right now, you might be a little disappointed with this album, as they are (musically) different. Likewise, if Opiate is the only Tool you have, you may be disappointed, considering this is mellower than Opiate.<br />Do not pay attention to the people who diss quality music, if you like it, get it, don't listen to the ones who put you down.<br />IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF OPINION!!!!!
B000050IE6|5.0|Still Life, Opeth's 4th album, contains, I think, some of their best work yet. Like My Arms, Your Hearse, the album tells a story. You will notice that a girl named Melinda is a recurring theme in the lyrics. It starts with The Moor. It fades in for about 2 minutes and then a pretty cool acoustic riff comes in. Then a bunch of awesome sounding layered growls come in and the song just gets better. Next is Godhead's Lament, which is an awesome song that contains what I think to be one of Opeth's best riffs. Then Benighted. Benighted is a wonderful song, probably their best acoustic song. Moonlapse Vertigo is next which is a really good song. Track 6, Serenity Painted Death is a heavy song with some pretty intense moments. The album ends with White Cluster, an action packed song about the main character in the story being hung. A great album.
B000002P2W|5.0|When Pete played the demos for the band, Keith Moon apparently started crying and hugged him. That kind of gives you an idea of how depressing this album can be. Almost all of the tracks are astounding after a few good listens. Many people pass this album by, but if you are a fan of the Who and opt not to buy this, you're making a big mistake.

I wonder if that's intentional? Probably.
0553208845|5.0|Hesse uses an Eastern setting and choses characters whom he has molded with the help of Eastern philosopies and religions.  In Siddartha, Hesse explores human psychology and the path that each human must take on his own to find place in the world -- to find peace, tranquility, nirvana in Siddartha's case.  Siddartha is an excellent example of Hesse's work which deals with the search for self and answers to life's mysteries.
B00004YYWI|5.0|Before I say anything, let me admit that I dont actually own this album; I burned it, so therefore I have not heard the bonus track. However, I am completely in love with every song on it, and I plan to purchase it, along with the rest of their albums which I either have burned or have already bought. Now, that that is out of the way, THIS ALBUM IS SHEER BRILLIANCE! Nothing short of genius. It all starts off with In The Mist She Was Standing, which, to be quite honest, with its use of wonderful melodies and harmonies and intricate guitar work, is my favorite song on this album. Next is Under The Weeping Moon. Great track with many acousic riffs. Kind of mysterious. After that is a track that proves that the piano is not just a classical instrument. Sillhouette is a great piano piece that absolutely sends chills down my spine to hear. Next up, Forest Of October. Another great song which has a wonderful, flowing intro. Track 5 is The Twilight Is My Robe, a wonderful song. Then comes Requiem, an awesome little instrumental (two guitars and a bass) that leaves you wanting more. The Apostle In Triumph gives you just that. It has a short intro that fades out and then out of nowhere the music starts again. The song is mostly acoustic and has a cool keyboard interlude towards the end. All in all, one of my favorite albums. Opeth is one of the best metal bands of all time, no question, and they deserve their own genre, for it pains me to see them lumped into the same general category (death metal) as bands like Cannibal Corpse and Dying Fetus.
B00005O5CM|4.0|For a movie completely aware that its artistic vision is humbly limited to the protagonist's choice of matching shades of loud pink, should critics punish it for setting its goal too low, or credit it accordingly for actually reaching that goal? This dilemma easily resolves in favor of the latter alternative, much in part because a movie this saccharine is a bit harder for the bitter cynic to bite. <br />A capsule synopsis might be all that is necessary: a fish-out-of-water comedy in the \\"girl-power\\" genre, with some romance thrown in for good measure.<br />Always warm from beginning to end, the movie does occasionally fall flat in some of its attempts at humor, not bad for a comedy in which almost every situation precipitates laughter from the audience--after lowering the standard for wit and intelligence, of course.
B000092ZYX|4.0|first of all, hail to the theif is radiohead's new album. its not ok computer 2 or kid a 2, its hail to the thief. too many gave this album bad reviews just because it wasnt what they were hoping for. the great thing about radiohead is that they change on each album they put out, which shows real talent. radiohead don't follow any patterns like your nu-metal acts out there such as linkin park, disturbed, or godsmack. ever notice how each of those bands' entire archive of music is EXACTLY the same? <br />anyway, definatly stay far away from this album if you are new to radiohead. i found it sort of difficult to get into them when i started listening to them because i got the wrong cd. i bought amnesiac and didnt like it that much, but now that i've gone back and heard the rest of radiohead's work i love it. hail to the theif is no differnt, it contains elements from all of their cds, but it has its own unique traits as well. its a lot more bleak and depressing lyrically, although i personally think thom yorke wrote brilliant lyrics for this album. definatly a reference to the shameful &quot;election&quot; of 2000 and the government's latest acts of violence lately. 2+2=5 is not only a great song with great lyrics, but the title is a reference to my favorite book 1984. <br />bottom line:  if you're new to radiohead, go back and get the bends or pablo honey. my personal favorite is still ok computer, but even that takes time to get into. radiohead are a band that grows on you over time.

0930289234|5.0|It took me two tries to read this book. My friend Justin who deserves an honorable menstion turned me on to Alan Moore with the movie from hell. So after that I immediately picked up Moore's masterpeice and started reading. I was fourteen at the time and I was confused about how the book would have a chapter of story then go on to give an article from the stories universe. Later on my fifteenth birthday I recived my own copy of Watchmen. With a years worth of comic knowledge I started to read again.  This time I found the story intigueing and the characters deep. The artwork is fantastic and the story has some twists that you won't exspect. It has gory, violent content and I wouldn't suggest giving to a younger reader. Besides they probably wouldn't understand it. All in all, get this book even if it confuses you at first put it down for a while and than read it again I garentee you'll understand it the second or third time around.

After this, and some of the songs on &quot;Help&quot;, the Beatles unfortunately slipped away into the studio, and fell victim to many studio produced sounds that lost the feel of Beatlemania.<BR>5-stars.
B00009ATIX|5.0|When most people ask me why I chose Solaris as the top film of 2002 out of a year that had BLOCKBUSTER written all over it, I round it up into one simple sentance; \\"This is a SCI-FI film that shows man's relationship to God. Before you start thinking I'm some religious zealot, let me assure you that I mean what I say only in a latteral sense. Kelvin's character is that of a man who creates another being just by the will of his mind, by a love that he can neither control nor respect. Clooney finds Kelvin's quiet dispair with gusto. But it is the two women in this movie, Nastasha McElhone (whom I loved since The Truman Show)and Viola Davis that are the show-stealers. McElhone as Rheya has the hardest job in the movie, especially near the end when she comes to realize the woman she was. Most actresses would overact in these situations, but not her. She plays it with a calmness that fits the character and Kelvin's tone. Viola Davis has the role that could have been easily typecasted as The Witch In Space. But she remains the voice of logic in the story when it seems everything is going to Disneyland. At this time, I think it's fair to mention Steven Soddeburgh's contribution. This is the perfect follow-up to his epic Traffic. And there you have it, just a little of essay I could write on this movie, explaining how this is THE BEST FILM of 2002
B00005JLXE|3.0|First off, let me state, that most of you won't agree with this review. Especially, if you're fans of this movie. But I simply want to make my opinion heard. This DVD has already been released in Australia so I can give a fair review about it.<br />The story revolves around Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck...Ugh!) who loses his sight at a very young age when chemical waste is sprayed onto his face due to a work accident. From there, his father (inspired by his son) goes back to his boxing past time. Where he then declines to take a dive and is ultimately killed by the mysterious Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).<br />Matt Murdock realises that even though he is blind, his other senses escalate to a point where he can practically see again. Matt Murdock, then fights for 'Justice' over the death of his father. Matt Murdock is DareDevil, a street smart vigilante crime-fighter who falls in love with the beautiful martial-arts master Elektra (Jennifer Garner).<br />The DVD itself is spectacular with DTS 5.1 and over 5 hours of special features. We are also given an excellent video transfer where the world of DareDevil really comes to life. The menus are also exquisite, with DareDevil's soundwave vision setting the scene. The DVD also includes Director's commentary with an 'Enhanced Viewing Mode' which is 8 multi-angle behind-the-scenes segments.<br />The documentaries give a great inside look to this 80 million dollar blockbuster. The second disc comes close to 3 hours of featurettes which is great for the up and coming film makers. All in all a great DVD.<br />Now, onto the movie. The movie is very Cliché. And when I say Cliché...I mean CLICHE. For instance, Matt Murdock is a lawyer and when a rapist gets away he walks out of the courtroom and his best friend asks if he wants to go out that night? Matt Murdock replies 'I'm busy' and then we pan in on his face showing him get into his DareDevil get up and go after the rapist. Another moment is when DareDevil is up on the rafters of a bar and a man asks him what he wants. DareDevil replies 'Justice' to which he goes and attacks all the criminals. <br />It seems as though the director didn't try and steer the Marvel superhero franchise into any new direction (unlike Ang Lee) but instead just tried to capitalise on the success of Comic book heroes of late. With a movie named 'DareDevil', you'd think that they would try and do something daring to the actual franchise to at least differentiate itself from Spiderman. But it does nothing of a sort. <br />The screenplay is dismal, it has an unoriginal plot and really is just a filler for 99 minutes. Mark Steven Johnson tries to pull out some biblical allusions spliced with how the Law is juxtaposed to it. Johnson also tries to recreate the gothic setting that Burton used so well in Batman, though it just seems as though the production crew ran out of ideas.<br />One of my biggest qualms with this movie is that there is absolutely NO character development. It just jumps from one scene to the other and assumes the viewer knows what is going on both story wise and character wise. And CGI seems to be overused in this film, I mean honestly, to CGI a rat walking through a gutter is just taking it too far.<br />In summary, the DVD is good with a score of 8/10. The movie though is just bad. Plain out, a film that relied on its budget and franchise name to get viewers. It gets a 4/10.<br />Get the DVD for the features....not the film!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved the movie. All the way through was like a joy ride. I loved the music in it. Everyone in the movie sang extremely well. I loved everything about it. Everytime i mention Moulin Rouge to my friends at church they break out in song. Nicole Kidman is like this amazing actress and wish that i looked like her. I never knew that Nicole Kidman has such a pretty voice.  Ewan McGregor is like the total hottie of the whole film. He has this amazing voice and I would love to meet him some day. The first time I saw the film i wanted the soundtrack. And i got it. I listen to it everyday and i have the songs memorized in my head. Thank you for this awesome movie.

B00008PC2O|4.0|Terminator 2: Judgment Day is arguably the best movie in the Terminator series. In the first movie, Arnold Swarchenegger (sp?) played the T-101 Terminator, who was assigned to kill Sarah Connor, who was to be the mother of the man who would lead the battle against an army of rogue machines called the Terminators. Now, Arnold reprises his role as the Terminator (now a T-850 model), who's become the hero sent back in time to protect the hero himself from a new, liquid-metal Terminator: the T-1000, a robot that is all but invincible. The movie has a great plot and action scenes. My only gripe about the film is that the special effects are exceptionally outdated. Still, T2 is a movie that deserves to be in anyone's film collection.
0385504209|2.0|O.K. people, remember that this is a NOVEL, not a history book. It is nothing more than a conspiracy theory which an uneducated, gullible public will easily swallow as history. Don't be fooled. Other than it's poor attempt at re-writing history, it is not a bad read. It does get a little preachy at times, and the characters are flat and predictable. It is really the conspiracy theory posing as history that carries this book.
B000089RVX|5.0|...would be a far better name for this band.  &quot;Evanescence&quot; is the worst name for a band I've heard since the '70s.   But that's my one minor gripe.  This album sounds like nothing else I've ever heard--spooky and ethereal combined with fat womping power cords.  <br />Amy Lee takes the high road--avoiding the skanked-out Britney/Aguilera sleaze, or the boil-your-bunny psycho chick vibe of Morissette/Tori Amos.  How refreshing to hear a truly feminine voice sung over heavy metal. Nobody's done that properly since Heart.

B000089RVX|3.0|Her voice is astonishing, it is beautiful and haunting. I love her voice a lot. Unfortuneately I think this was the only thing I truly liked about this cd. When I spun it the first time, I was happy it sounded nice and everything was good... but as I listened I realized that this CD was... all the same. All of the tracks sound the same... They all have the same theme the guitar sounds the same... it's boring. Their sound is very nu-metal which is annoying, because nu-metal sucks... in fact their noise reminds me of Linkin Park. I have a feeling the next cd is gonna sound exactly the same as this one... I liked it originally...but I realize now it was all her voice and the whole mall-goth poser hot-topic theme is just not my idea of good music. I give them three... but that's all her voice... if you want better stuff of a similar style, check out Lacuna Coil.
B00005JMC6|4.0|\\"Whale Rider\\" was released on June 6th 2003, it is rated PG-13, and is 1 hour 45 minutes long. Whale Rider is directed by Niki Caro and is based on the book written by Witi Ihimaera. The main actor in this film is newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes who was selected from many hopefuls to play the role of Pai. Keisha performs her role extremely well and makes the film complete. Her performance is well balanced by that of Rawiri Paratene who plays Pai's grandfather Koro. Other actors in the film are Vicky Haughton who plays Flowers, Pai's grandmother, and Cliff Curtis who plays Porourangi, Pai's father.<br />Whale Rider is set in the coastal village of Whangara, New Zealand. It is the story of a young Maori girl, named Pai, and her fight to defy the hard set traditions of her people. The film is told through the eyes of Pai and begins tragically when her mother dies while giving birth to her twin brother. Porourangi is disgraced, as his son was supposed to carry on the line of chiefs, and so leaves the village indefinitely. Pai is left in the care of her grandparents, her grandfather, Koro, being the current chief of the tribe. Once Pai turns twelve Koro rounds up all the boys in the tribe and begins to teach them the ancient ways in hope of finding a new successor. Pai is not allowed to train as she is female so she seeks out the help of her uncle to teach her the customs. Her struggle begins, her aim being to break tradition and take her rightful place in the tribe.<br />The gorgeous scenery of New Zealand makes a perfect backdrop for this film and the carved meeting houses help to intensify the Maori culture; the visual quality is excellent. The acting in the film contributed to making the characters exceptional, they are very believable and the audience is able to relate to how they are feeling. Much of the music used in Whale Rider is traditional of the Maori people and incorporates song and dance; it has specific cultural significance and is characteristic of New Zealand. Overall I found this film to be outstanding and exceedingly moving; one that should not be missed.
B000002MU3|4.0|This is a very good album. The lyrics are brillant and are straight from the soul. What people forget is that this album is dedicated to River phoenix and Kurt Cobain. the impact of their deaths, more the first, has put such an amazing heartfelt power over the second part of the album. It is clear that Stripes was badley affected with the death of his close friend River Phoenix. Inside the sleeve one can see that it is clearly dedicated to him. <br />This album is brillant. A must for any R.E.M. fan and for anyone still morning the loss of two great people. They can find solis here.

B000002U8G|5.0|1971's &quot;Meddle&quot; was the album that gave Pink Floyd their first substantial slice of success since their early days with Syd Barrett. The band had been working steadily since Barrett's departure in 1968, recording four excellent albums (including some film music), but none of them had made that much of a dent on the album charts. And while massive success would still have to wait until 1973's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon,&quot; it was with &quot;Meddle&quot; that rock audiences started to take notice of Pink Floyd once again. The album shows many different sides to the band: &quot;One Of These Days&quot; is a classic Floyd rocker, with the wind effects &amp; Roger Waters' galloping bassline setting the whole thing in motion before the band come crashing in with everything they've got. &quot;A Pillow Of Winds&quot; is a lovely, wistful song with fine vocals from guitarist David Gilmour, and &quot;Fearless&quot; is a sparkling acoustic number (capped off with a football audience singing &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot;). &quot;San Tropez&quot; is a fun cocktail-jazz ditty (and quite different from anything else the Floyd have ever done), and &quot;Seamus&quot; is an amusing little blues number about a dog (complete with dog barking accompanyment). Finally, there's the Floyd's 23 1/2 minute extravaganza, &quot;Echoes,&quot; one of their all-time greatest pieces, beginning with the single, echoed &quot;ping&quot; on Richard Wright's piano, before it slowly builds and builds, and the band add more &amp; more musical layers to it, finally extending into a fantastic funky jam session in the middle. The jam fades out, replaced by strange environmental noises &amp; calls, before the Floyd rise above it like a phoenix rising from the ashes, amid killer guitarwork from Gilmour, and send this magnificent piece home (and by the way, for extra fun, try playing &quot;Echoes&quot; against the &quot;Jupiter And Beyond The Infinite&quot; section of Stanley Kubrick's sci-fimasterpiece, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;---this sync is just as amazing to watch as the famous &quot;Dark Side&quot;/&quot;Wizard Of Oz&quot; sync). Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and drummer Nick Mason sound superb on this album, their musical chemistry simply outstanding. From fade-in to fade-out, &quot;Meddle&quot; is a bonafied Pink Floyd classic.

Each one of his books propelled me forward to read another, and another.  It is worth stating that one of my happiest days ever was to re-visit Cannery Row and explore the places  he wrote about.
B000001IQH|5.0|This album is absolutley perfect when looking for a punk album that combines thoughful lyrics, great music, and tremendous attitude.  This is a MUST for a record collection that includes rock of any kind.  This is Rancid's finest work and it is also the only one of their albums that gets oodles of praise and respect from not only punk fans, but fans of rock in general and music critics.
0767903862|4.0|The only reason I gave this 4 stars in because he didn't bring his hilarious cohort, Katz, so eloquently introduced to us in _A Walk in the Woods_.<br />But, even alone, Bill carries on without compromise to bring forth hilarious encounters, touching significance and the palpable joy of newly explored travel destined to loosen the grip of the most tenacious buttocks from the oldest lounge chairs, chaises and couches.  It is a valuable book to those traveling to the regions Bill visited.  He capably reviews and explores the more outstanding places of interest.  Having this book accompany you on your journey would be a lighthearted and helpful guide.<br />As Bill travels from city to town and outback, he effortlessly captures the essence of the individuality of towns and regions.  It is a loosely gathered tangle of stories which is derived from the unusual experiences of the solo traveler. It is certainly the openness of Mr. Bryson that lends to intelligent, humorous and whimsical interpretations of his experiences in Australia that enhances a traveler's exploration down-under.
B000001XN2|5.0|I am the biggest fan of the tenor of not only this Century but of all time...going back to the era of Rubini. Franco Corelli is the emperor of tenors and he kills Bjoeling, Caruso, and Gigli.<BR>First, I must say that this recording is live. But the sound is excellent. If you have the 1955 Callas Lucia, and can deal with that sonics, you'll be happy with the recorded sounds here.<BR>There are two outrageously fantastic scenes. The scene with the Queen, supremely sung by the very young Dame Joan and the Grand duet with Corelli/Simionato.<BR>I'm not out to exaggerate. But these two highlights are miraculous. Sutherland, in 1962 voice with super squillo and gigantic high notes(high C's,D's,E'sand even Fs are easy for her)These notes are the size of Nilsson's, and they left me with my jaws hanging and breathless. La stupenda simply attacks every terrifying notes of Marguerite's taxing coloratura and adds her own even more difficult embellishments. Tossing trills and fiorituri, here, there, and everywhere,  making even the most arduous coloratura unsingable to all other divas seem like child's play. She trills and trills all through her great scene, high above the staff and taking 64th notes as if it's nothing. Her rendition of O beau pays and its even more taxing cabaletta is just a stroll in the part for her. Sutherland's exquisite super squillo, especially the notes above the staff makes all other sopranos take up pottery or needle-point(take your pick), her trills-both high and low are what legends are made of, to shame the flute, and the fioritura so fast that the orchestra has to catch up with her, we're talking 64th notes that cover 20 seconds at a time through two octaves. Sorry, this one must be heard to believe the scope of Dame Joan's power when she was in her prime. This is bravura singing in the style never heard since the days of Malibran! If corelli is the Emperor, she is his emperess, and we know that it's the empress who rules. No wonder she is called the &quot;Voice of the Century!<BR>The second spectacular highlight is the glorious duet between Corelli and Simionato. Now this is verisimo singing in all its glories. Super high emotions with super high notes. Both Corelli and Simionato attacks them without fear in complete accuracy and power. Their ringing high notes are the best that these two great artists have ever put on record, live or studio. That Corelli takes his high B's and C's to the ultimate length- extending them to heights no tenors have ever attempted, or even dreamed of. And that's saying a lot about the king of tenors. High B's and C's and D flats are all blasting with squillo , piercing through the orchestra and ensembles like a dagger through a dragon's heart. Simionato matching these high notes(very surprising for a mezzo). She even holds and match a D flat with Corelli. This is Verisimo singing for the books. And this could be the most awesome live recording of an opera in the last century...Infinitely, and I repeat, infinitely  superior to even the Corelli/Price Travatore... and with far superior sound.<BR>Truly a voice lover's wildest wet dream! This is a combination of bel canto and verisimo singing taken to the limits of the human vocal cords. It is definitely the last word for the possibilities and wonders of the human voice. <BR>Bravissimi, divo, diva...To Sutherland, Prima donna Assoluta, per sempre...pushing even Callas to the second spot. To Corelli, you put Pavarotti, Bjoeling and Gigli to shame. A dream performance of the highest magnitude. And quite possibly the greatest live performance of a bravura opera ever recorded.<BR>Search for Gli Ugonotti, Corelli/Sutherland
B000003S0F|3.0|First, I gave three stars because these King Crimson album is part of the 70's albums (it should deserve a miserable two stars), and I REALLY like this KC era. Second, all KC 70's albums (except the disgusting EARTHBOUND) are five stars for me, except ISLANDS, from 1971. This album is an interesting effort to make symphonic progressive rock with some jazzistic influences. LIZARDS, from 1970, has a MARVELOUS jazzy touch and its musical structure is simply perfect. The album is quite complex and the band fit very well in the context. <BR>    In ISLANDS, the line-up is weaker than in LIZARDS. Boz Burrel is sometimes horrible playing bass. His voice is not that bad, but who listened to KC wih Greg Lake really thinks: &quot;What this guy are trying to sing?&quot;. Ian Wallace is too much economic on drums, there is NO creativity in his movements. I'll not talk about Fripp's talents, he's a genious, but in Islands Fripp are not experimenting, exploring all of his guitar abilities, like in RED, or LARKS'. The rest of the band is ok, altough tedious in 50% of the album, and Collins is not as inspired as in LIZARDS. <BR>    The album has a good and clean sound. It's a relaxing KC album, but sometimes boring. The best tracks are Sailor's Tale (with a strong sax line and some Frippish guitar tunes), The Letter (a complex song, reminding something from LIZARDS) and Ladies of the Road (a KC hard rock, with some blues vocals and Beatles-like tunes). Formentera Lady is troughly beautiful, but it goes to nowhere in 10 mins ! The first part is simply pure heaven... Islands is really boring, with some nice melodic arrangements in the beggining. Prelude: Song of the Gulls is an orchestrated track, beautiful, but totally out of the context. <BR>    ISLANDS is not a TOP KC album, but there are some NICE songs that deserves attention. The line-up has less qualities than in the previous albums but works OK. (Boz Burrel is mediocre anyway). WE have to remember that we're comparing ISLANDSto LARKS', RED, LIZARDS and even to the perfect IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSOM KING ! Check these albums before Islands, if possible...
B000009HF2|5.0|This Live Album is truely the best live album of the 1970's.<BR>It is truely a classic. I purchased this album back in 1970's, on album, yes, album not CD, and still own it to this day.<BR>So if you like classic rock and roll you'll certanily want to add this #1 classic to your music collection.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This is the best show I have ever seen on TV.  I am absolutely hooked on this show, and cannot wait until the second season is released on DVD.
B000002U94|5.0|This  is a great follow up to Bob Seger's &quot; Live Bullet&quot; album,<BR>from classics like  &quot; Betty Lou&quot; to Night Moves&quot;. All the hits that came after Live Bullet is featured on this collection.<BR>I own this recording on Album, like so many great rock bands of the 1970's and early 1980's I own on album, and will not part with to this day. So if you liked Live Bullet you'll surely like this recording as well.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Flashdance is probably one of the best movies there is that was released in the immortal decade of the eighties.  Released at around the same time as 'Dirty Dancing', 'Footloose', and 'The Lambada', Flashdance managed to get quite a bit of viewer attention.  <BR>The basic plot is that Alex, played by Jennifer Beals, is a welder by day and works by night as a dancer in a bar.<BR>Her biggest dream is to become a famous dancer and go to a prestigious dance school.<BR>As can be expected, a romance blooms between Alex and her boss at the welding factory.  <BR>Alex is repeatedly asked out by her boss and she shoots him down every time.<BR>He finally asks her why she won't go out with him and Alex tells him that she dosen't think that it is a good idea to go out with the boss, (And she is NOT referring to Bruce Springsteen when she says this)<BR>Her boss then gives her what I believe to be the funniest line in the entire movie: &quot;Fine.  You're fired.  I'll pick you up at eight.&quot;<BR>Of course he dosen't actually fire her that was just his way of getting her to go out with him.
B00002E233|3.0|Director Renny Harlin is best known for his action flicks like Die Hard 2 and The Long Kiss Goodnight.  In Deep Blue Sea he combines his trademark action with horror.   Centered on genetically enhanced sharks, it's tempting to compare it to Jaws.  Indeed, the opening scene pays homage to the classic shark flick, but that is where the similarity ends.  Actually, DBS reminds me more of a Michael Crichton movie with its science gone bad storyline.  The story takes place on a research laboratory in the middle of the ocean.  Researchers are using the brains of live sharks to harvest a protein that is a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease.  In order to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein, the lead scientist genetically enhances the shark brains to increase their size.  This has the effect of making the sharks \\"smart\\".  The result is sharks that will do anything to escape captivity.<br />The action starts early and never lets up.  Stranded in the lower levels, the station survivors are picked off one by one as they try to make their way to the surface.  Harlin provides ample \\"sudden\\" attacks by the sharks to provide several shocking moments.  Notable cast members include LL Cool J, Samual L. Jackson, and Michael Rapaport.   Model Saffron Burrows takes on the \\"Sigourney Weaver\\" heroin role.  Deep Blue Sea benefits from the advances in FX since the Days of Jaws.  A combination of CGI and animatronics are used to provide convincing sharks.   <br />The disc has some nice extras including a making of documentary, deleted scenes, and commentary from Renny Harlin and S.L. Jackson.  The picture is presented nicely in widescreen format.  There are quite a few loud noises to give your surround system a workout and it comes across well in Dolby 5.1.  If you own Jaws, this movie makes a nice companion piece.  Recommended.
0316096199|4.0|Lucky moved me in a way that no other book had. I am not a very emotional person but this book brought out emotions I never even knew I had. When Alice cried so did I. While she was on the stand and after she got off the stand I too felt exhausted. I read this book three times and can't wait to read it again. This book is truely amazing. Alice Sebold holds nothing back and shows how much talent she really has. This book is not only disturbing but also very full of hope all at the same time. I urge you to go out and read this book. Alice is a brave soul and deserves great recognition for this piece of art. I love the book more each time I read it.
1558216847|5.0|Given my reading speed, this was one of those rare books that I started and finished in less than a week.  Oftentimes, I wondered to myself how much of this was actually true.  If the author did not have the chance to transcribe his memories into writing until decades later, it is amazing how the story was told to the last detail.  Even the conversations and thoughts, perhaps vaguely remembered, seemed believable.  The writing itself, however, was well done that I could dwell in the author's experiences and allow myself to imagine the far reaches of his and his companions' motivation to survive and the limits of their endurance, both physical and emotional.<br />The geography of their &quot;long walk&quot; was all the more remarkable considering there was not really any better alternative.  If they veered a little more to the southwest, they could have traversed the Altai Mountains, the Tien Shan, and the Taklamakan desert, plus some of the other formidable ranges of Central Asia that survival might be even less likely.  Navigating by the rising and setting of the sun and the instinct for survival were their means of accomplishing their goal.<br />Although the book ended abruptly, I would still give the author credit for some fine points.  For example, the sighting of two mysterious figures in the Himalayan foothills was written in a cautious manner and was in no way sensational (mention of the abominable snowman was saved to the end of that particular episode).  The memory of the sense of scale and landmarks that foretold the near accomplishment of their goal, such as the first mountain range that marked the beginning of the Kunlun mountains and the last mountain range that marked the end of the Himalayas, was telling.  The almost limitless hospitality accorded to them by the nomads and the western Chinese/Tibetans was very touching.  Not to mention the sense of loss over three of his companions.<br />Of course, there were also the harrowing memories of his imprisonment, his trials, and his trans-Siberian trip by train and by foot to oblivion.  I could not help wondering which would have been the lesser of two evils: to stay in gulag hell or to escape to nowhereland.  The author's will to survive won out.<br /><br />If you want to read someone's memoirs of a geography that covered the breadth from northern forests to deserts to mountain ranges, from bitter cold to searing heat--in the throes of survival--this is it.risonment, his trials, and his trans-Siberian trip by train and by foot to oblivion.

B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna is the evergreen Queen of Pops. I cherish her most beautiful songs 'Like a virgin', True Blue, material girl, etc and her video albums were terrific in those days! With this release, I really appreciate her two songs 'American Life' and 'Hollywood' where she sure has the mature spell n her more suave vocals. No doubt, she's maintained her trimline but nevertheless in her younger days, it was too exciting to watch her shows n listen to her videos. By Jove, Madonna was a heart throb! Apart from her two songs, I'm so stupid is a lame song (Maybe becoz I've heard similar song b4 which is lively!) Die Another Day do not create waves as it should. Overall a slogging down chart numbers than her all previous ones but if one is a fan - Bingo! Sure, this is a great pick for two Songs 'American Life' and 'Hollywood' - Yeah, Madonna's remained cool even today! Can't deny it. Pick up the Songs & Enjoy!
B00005Y7NK|3.0|I enjoyed hearing this one again, but the guitars on this album are way too low.  Isn't that what sabbath used to be about?  Isn't IOMMI on this record?  I wonder.  The songs aren't bad though.  Check out Born again if you want non-Ozzy or non-Dio sabbath.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Well they did it. They pulled of T3. It was amazing, I think I preferred it a little to T2 cos there was a less corny approach, ie kid with machine. Yet there was always a time when appropriate to laugh, as there needs to be in any drama.<br />And they dont try to catch the laugh, they let it just be funny naturally.<br />You can sense the lake of Hamilton and Cameron but still.. It may have been Alien3 but at least the aliens stayed the same.<br />5 Stars<br />Congratulations
B000006CCG|5.0|was seeing them in concert back in the day.  Great CD from beginning to end.  Buy it now!  The torture never stops!!!
B000035Z3K|5.0|I just wanted to say as most of you already know this movie is a classic in every way, shape, and from, but why are all the universal monster films out of stock on DVD? They need to re-release them. I only had the chance to buy Dracula. It's a real shame, cause it's a real good DVD with ALOT of nice bonus features! They REALLY need to get it back in stock ASAP!
B00005JLK1|3.0|At salvage crew sets out for the Bering Sea to locate a deserted ship and to bring her back in.  One stormy night, they come across the ship, almost out of nowhere, and it turns out to be none other than the Antonio Graza, an Italian cruise ship lost at sea in 1962.  The crew's captain recalls that every salvage crew around the world has been looking for this ship and its cargo of gold bars.  Eerie things start to happen, such as the sighting of a young girl, music replacing the chatter on the walkie talkies, a digital watch found in the helm.  Soon, the salvage crew is fighting for their lives against the evil forces at work in the ship.<br />This is a decent movie, if somewhat predictable.  Julianna Margulies (as Maureen Epps) and Emily Browning (as Katie Hargrove) are both quite good and wind up being the only characters I cared about.  What really stands out in this movie are the special effects and the creepy atmosphere of the ship.  The opening sequence alone is quite ingenious and sets the mood for the enitre film.  The interior of the ship itself is dark and gloomy, and ranges from narrow, claustrophobic hallways to cavernous, tomb-like rooms.<br />Also, some of the extras on the DVD are worth watching, such as the featurette about how all the gore sequences were created.  There is also a game which, if played correctly, reveals some insight into the events of that fateful night when the Antonio Graza disappeared.<br />The overall story is a bit formulaic, but with just enough visual candy to make it worth while.
0783225792|5.0|This movie doesn't get the respect it deserves. Many people insist on insulting it just because of it's likeness to \\"Good Fellas\\". While \\"Casino\\" shares many characteristics with \\"Good Fellas\\"  (as almost anyone who's seen both movies will tell you), it's really not as similar as it might seem. True, it does have some of the same actors (De Niro and Pesci), it's based on a book by the same author, and it has the same kind of story (the rise and fall of a mafioso), but the movies are different in several respects. Where as \\"Good Fellas\\" was more related to the business life of the main characters, \\"Casino\\" seems to be a bit more related to the personal lives of it's characters. When \\"Good Fellas\\" was over, I didn't really feel as though I knew Henry Hill all that well, but in \\"Casino\\", I felt as though I understood the Ace Rothstein to some extent. The point of both movies was to explore the organized crime world, but \\"Good Fellas\\" was an introduction to to the professional lives and \\"Casino\\" continued in the same tradition, but by delving deeper into the personal lives. In the end, I suppose that it is a companion piece, but not in a bad way. It's not the kind of film that just recycles the same material and doesn't bring in anything new.<br />Putting aside the comparisons to other movies, \\"Casino\\" is really an excellent film in and of itself. It chronicles the rise and fall of 3 individuals, Ace Rothstein, his very violent best friend Nicky Santoro, and his wife and only real weakness, ex prostitute Ginger. In the process, the film reveals the inner workings of a corrupt, mafia run, Las Vegas casino, and shows just what it takes to actually run one. It's great to be shown just how casinos and the gambling business work. This movie gives a more technical look at the industry than other movies do, and it's definitly not the kind of info you get every day.<br />The performances here are all top notch. De Niro is superb as Ace Rothstein (based on actual gambling expertLefty Rosenthal) and Pesci is stellar as Nick Santoro. Sharon Stone got an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ginger, which was well deserved. I thought that she did a pretty good job, all though she seemed a little over the top at some times throughout the movie. Despite this minor flaw, this is easily her best work. James Woods is also excellent as Ginger's ex boyfriend and low rent pimp Lester and despite having minimal screen time, he leaves a lasting impression on the audience. Kevin Pollack is also great in the small role of official Casino boss, Phillip Green.<br />The set and costume designs are all great. The glamorous Las Vegas scenery is spectacular and looks absolutely incredible. The clothing is great too. De Niro's multi-thousand dollar suits look fantastic and Sharon Stone's gowns and fur coats all look excellent as well, as does the clothing of all the minor characters, right down to the cowboy outfit that the Nevada State Gambling Comission guy wears.<br />The direction here is nothing short of spectacular. Even more proof that Scorsese is one of, if not the, best director ever. I can't understand how such an incredible talent has been robbed of the Best Director Oscar so many times. He should've gotten at least a nomination for this movie (he probably should've won too, all though \\"Brave Heart\\" was a good movie as well), but instead they gave one to some guy who directed a movie about a talking pig or something. How ridiculous is that? But anyway, pay no attention to what the fools who run Academy say, the direction here is absolutely incredible. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. The way the camera moves around the casino floor is breath taking and the stretch following the guy into the count room is almost as good as the Copa Cabana stretch in \\"Good Fellas\\". This movie is absolutely stunning visually. <br />As for the accusations that this movie is gratuitously violent and features excessive blood and gore, it's really notas bad as some would have you beleive. I think that it's just become a tendency of critics (an others for that matter) to always label Scorsese's movies as being violent just because he started out with that kind of reputation. Not that there isn't blood and violence here, but it's not half as bad some other movies that aren't chastised nearly as much as this one. It amazes me how some people who watch this movie are shocked by the violence, because it is a movie about criminal life and criminal life is violent. To show it in any other way would be dishonest and I think that this film should be commended for being responsible enough to sacrifice a little bit of marketability for being honest and giving a truthful portrayal of the lifestyle it depicts.<br />All in all, this is a movie that's not to be missed. Even though it may be often misunderstood in many ways, it's still a great movie. It shows the great skill of all involved from the cast and the crew. It's tremendously entertaining and is definitly worth seeing.
B00005BCPC|5.0|Sorry, angry people, but me and my wife really enjoyed this film, back in 99'. We found it fun, original, creative, a beautiful work all in all. I'm not an expert on Austen, but have read and love some of her books. Also, Ive seen several movie and TV adaptations: among them, 'Mansfield Park' is in my opinion one of the best.In many ways, it brings a refreshly different yet respectful approach to JA's novels.
B000002AH7|4.0|This album is very good, no doubt, but I only give it 4 stars when compared to many of his other albums.   <br />Believe it or not, the 20 bit digital re-mastering stands out most for me. The sound quality is amazing. This cd sounds as if it was recorded yesterday.<br />However, as far as content goes, I think this cd is a bit over rated.  First of all, this really isn't jazz (at least my definition of jazz anyway).  Miles is brilliant, Gil Evans is brilliant, the band is brilliant, but this just isn't the type of jazz I like to listen to.  Some people have classified this as \\"Jazzed-Up Spanish Classical,\\" and I guess that works for me, because I really can't think of a better way to describe it.<br />I just prefer the quintent recordings between 1965-1968: 'Miles Smiles,' 'Sorcerer,' 'Nefertiti,' and 'ESP.' I also like 'Kind of Blue' (of course), 'Porgy & Bess' and many others way better than this.  All of these albums are far more listenable, and contain the kind of jazz and the kind of Miles Davis music that I prefer.<br />Also, on this cd, there are 2 versions of 'Concierto De Aranjuez.'  One track is the original cut. The other is an alternate take. Both are basically the same and play for about 16 minutes, but unfortunately, I really don't care that much for this track.  So basically that amounts to 32 minutes worth of music that I could do without.  Miles is great, but again, this just isn't the type of jazz or the Miles Davis kind-of-music that I like to listen to.<br />Bottome line: <br />Look somewhere else if you want to buy your first Miles Davis CD. Start with any of the cd's I mentioned above for a much better sample of his work.  <br />However, with all that said, I still would consider this a \\"must have\\" CD for any true Miles Davis fan, and I do listen to this CD a lot even though my review is somewhat negative. Afterall, I did give this a 4 star rating, and that isn't that bad...
B00007J4SI|5.0|Pick up a copy of the somewhat eccentric biography of Scriabin by Bowers, and settle in with this fabulous tribute to Scriabin's piano miniatures, and lose yourself in the incredible intensity that this composer could bring to the tiniest little piano study. Every piece is concentrated sound poetry, and a five CD set is almost too much to bear. <br />I've heard many different approaches to Scriabin's piano music, and that's actually part of the delight in hearing any performance -- the music seems to draw out the personality of the performer in a most astonishing way, and Michael Ponti is ready and able to give us expert performances.<br />You may want to hear other performers as well, but Ponti really serves this music with exceptional style.
B000089CJI|5.0|DO NOT MISS THIS ALBUM! i had never heard of death cab before this album, but once i heard that song... district sleeps alone tonight... it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! this is an amazing rare find. do not miss it! i can't stress it enough. you won't be disappointed.
B000005J56|5.0|Born on November 18, 1907 in Siboney, Cuba, Maximo Francisco Repilado Munoz (better known as &quot;Compay Segundo&quot;) died of kidney failure on July 13, 2003 in Havana, Cuba.  Farewell to an unbelievably charismatic and talented musician.  Known for his sporty, Borsalino-style hats and trademark cigars, Segundo was truly young at heart and rich in sound.  He reemerged in popularity in 1997 with the Buena Vista Social Club documentary and CD.  With the passing of segundo, the world has lost a truly unique and irreplaceable sound.
B000002H6C|5.0|I believe this is the best Metallica album to date.  Their sound and talents have really grown with every album.  Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets are all great albums, but the song writing, drums and guitars destroy on this album.  'Dyer's Eve' is the best song on the track, Lars going all out on the double bass and James just screaming his contempt at controlling parents maes you want to head bang.<BR>    <BR>Every track on here is great and picking a best one was hard.  All i have to say is give it some time, sit down and listen to the whole album, or have it in the background, like when you work out (by the way, Metallica is the best music to work out too) and your love for this album will grow.  No doubt Cliff's death hurt, but they came back and showed that his spirit is still with them and that this is what he would want.<BR>    <BR>It is true that when going through great tribulations, your real character is shown, and their character is extraordinary.
B00005JKZV|4.0|the first lord of the rings movie was astonishing it blew minds away at the spectacular visual effects many say that this 3 part story collection is the star wars of our time.....when seeing the tow towers i was within the first 5 minutes hooked to the film by its special effects to its really good acting and the storyline is great also the second lord of the rings has alot more action than the first and doing do that requires more special effects all in all this was outstanding buy the dvd when it comes out
B00005JLWL|5.0|The review you see above, the amazon review I must say is a load of crap. I just saw the movie today, and I went in to watch this movie with pretty low expectations, expecting a cheap thrill is over the top guns fights and a story a six year old could have written in 5 minutes. However, I was pleasantly surprised after the first fight scene to see that there was indeed a story, and contrary to what I thought, it was surprisingly deep and very well done.<br /> The review above, the amazon review caught my attention by stateing that the fight scene was stupid for the fight was spurred by a puppy. And if I had not seen the movie, I would have probably agreed that fighting over a puppy is pretty stupid story wise, however, if you watch the scene, it is actually quite moving, hearing the dogs getting killed and than introducing a view of a innocent puppy going up to a cold blooded killer and stirring something up inside of the clerick.<br /> I could go on longer, however, I will not, I will wrap up this review by saying that this is very high quality movie magic. Action scenes to droll over, a story that'll make you think be grateful for emotions, and an ending that'll make you really smile from ear to ear. If you want to spend your money well, you'll be wise to spend it on a movie of this high caliber.
B000001G53|5.0|Of the many Parsifal recordings available, this is one of the very best.  Karajan perfectly captures the depraved beauty of the score, with a most impressive cast of singers.  Hofmann is the most believable Parsifal on record and Vejovic is in powerful, intense voice.  Van Dam and Moll are without equal, and the Berlin Philharmonic and chorus sound out of this world.  Flawless digital recording, with perfect balance between voice and orchesta.
076783819X|5.0|This movie is awesome. I think it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. However, can someone here tell me what the DVD alternate ending is? In reviews that I have seen, viewers and the directors both say they're glad they chose the one used in the movie. But does anyone know what the alternate ending was?
B00004R99M|5.0|Mary Poppins (along with Snow White and the Seven Dwarves) stands out as the crowning achievements of the Walt Disney Studios. Mary Poppins is the definitive musical fantasy that others tried to imitate. Evet song is a classic from the Oscar winning \\"Chim Chim Cherrie\\" to the final tune \\"Lets go fly a kite\\". One of the best routine was the chimminy sweep dance number where you had breathtaking view of the London skyline. Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were at their musical best. The part where they were riding on the carousel horses is a pure classic.    I am suprised this did not make AFI's top 100 movies list. This movie is the pinnacle of family entertainment that has entertained children for nearly three generations.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I have to admit I had a bit of difficulty getting used to the quick-talking British actors, and for the first part of the film, I also did not know who was who because there were so many characters.  However, this movie was brilliant, if you give it a chance.  It accurately reflects how a strong class sytem and its inherent hypocrisies permeated British society in the post-war era.<br />The plot comes together perfectly at the end.  Take the time to view this film -- pay attention and enjoy.  It's worth the watch!
0385504209|1.0|I got this book thanks to the hype and good reviews my friends, family and online gave to this book.  I finally finished it last night, thank god!  Like others have said, the beginning is really good.  It hooks you and really gets you &quot;sunk&quot; into the book.<br />After about 30 chapters (out of 100+), it gets tedious and boring.  I found myself skipping or skimming pages, all about religion and symbology.  I mean, it was boring and I really didn't like reading it all.  They go on and on and on and on...there's lots of extra writing in here, where they could be more short and sweet.<br />I didn't really think the plot was really realistic, especially certain scenes where they get out of &quot;messes&quot;, such as the airplane scene.  There are very few good parts.  I found myself waiting and waiting for it to get better, and found myself miserable at the end.<br />If you just &quot;have&quot; to read this, borrow someone's copy or buy one of the used, cheaper copies.<br />I don't understand all the hype...
B00000AFWW|2.0|I remember purchasing this album on one rushed listen simply based on my love for Live Through This, which stands (Cobain-influenced or not) as this band's crowning acheivement.  This, however... well, what went wrong?  On first few listens it's appealing, catchy as hell, and in spots a bit grungy.  But give it time and you realize half of the songs are tissue-thin girly pop that doesn't hold up over time.  Love's voice, which though nasaly at least had edge to it on Live Through This, seems so forced and fake here that it's hard sometimes to contain your laughter.  Only a few songs (Celebrity Skin, Reasons to be Beautiful, Northern Song) manage to hold some depth to them, and showcase the power and evocative qualities of her voice.  Otherwise, there's absolute poppy garbage like \\"Awful,\\" \\"Malibu,\\" and the leader of them all, \\"Boys on the Radio,\\" possibly the sappiest sounding song ever penned.  Granted, this is an easy album to like, but an impossible one to love.  All surface, no feeling.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna's latest isn't the terrible record many have made it out to be, although it won't do much to capture attention and intrigue like her last two, the effortlessly irresistible Music and the second best album of her career, 1998's Ray Of Light. American Life spins the same yarns about the evils of fame and how we should no longer be living in the material world Madonna herself has celebrated for most of her career. However, there is still some fun to be had where growth is lacking. The ultra rump shaker \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and the sunny/dark /ballad/dance tune \\"Hollywood\\" compete for belle of the ball, while \\"Die Another Day\\" makes a repeat but much needed appearance to save our poor souls from anymore Kumbayah campfire- sing alongs and one really embarrassing (intentional tongue-in-cheek camp or not) rap. Comparisons to 1989's epic Like A Prayer are not quite right, but understandable. The new album does explore themes such as family and religion, only \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" said it first and better than the otherwise catchy and cute \\"Mother and Father\\" and \\"Nothing Fails\\" is a nice attempt at riding the coat tails of \\"Like A Prayer\\"-but it fails. Overall, if you're a hardcore Madonna fan, every pose she strikes will strike you as brilliant but if you're a hardcore Madonna fan who knows that not all of her albums are that great, you'll recognize the many flaws this one has to offer. I'm not saying Madonna has completely lost it, but I will say her ambition and edge have both taken a \\"Holiday\\" which I hope will end as soon as possible.<br />Standouts: \\"Hollywood\\", \\"I'm So Stupid\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Mother and Father\\", \\"Die Another Day\\"
B00008PC2O|5.0|&quot;Terminator 2 - Judgment Day,&quot; possibly the greatest action film ever made, is given what is possibly the greatest digital makeover ever created. Now, I've never owned &quot;The Ultimate Edition DVD,&quot; but I know that 2-Disc DVD had a great second disc of extras. Now, the second disc is minimal for regular DVD-owners (it is mostly for DVD-Rom owners), but the featurettes are awesome to watch, especially the eight-minute production featurette with hilarious outtakes. The main extras are on disc one, including an outstanding audio-and-visual presentation of the film, and an enhanced-viewing mode that goes inside every facet of the making of this awesome film. Even if you have &quot;The Ultimate Edition DVD,&quot; get this edition just for the new digital transfer! Movie/DVD grade: A+
0790729725|5.0|This movie is insanely good! With out doubt one of the best mob movies ever made. Starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. This movie is the true story of Liotta's character  getting into to the mob at a very young age and moving up the ranks.  \\"GoodFellas\\" goes through his life until the end were he gets his self into trouble with the law and latter on with the mob. Before it's over tons of wackings and a surprise ending or at least I think so! When Liotta try's to leave the mob and it doesn't work out as he planned. This movie has everything a good mob movie should have Killings, people ripping other people off, killing, cops, jail. Oh, and more killing! This is truly a movie no one interested in the mob should miss out on, if you like the Sopranos you will LOVE this! This is truly a classic among classics this is a must own and it really is one of the best movies ever made!
B00008S2VG|1.0|This is the worst Madonna's album.  Don't waste your money on this.  Ray of light &amp; Music were about something!  This is ridiculous.
B000000OAN|5.0|A Night At The Opera by Queen is one of the greatest albums of all time, if you were to make a list of the best albums this has to be in the top 15! This album is Queens best! Freddie Mercury's voice is top notch as always and Brian Mays Guitar work is amazing like always. Yes this is the one with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" but this album is so much more then that it has the Queen classic \\"My Best Friend\\" and my favorite Queen song \\"The Prophets Song\\" which is amazing! The only bad thing about this album is where Freddie does not sing, other then that this is a great album. other great songs are \\"Love Of My Life\\" which is Queens prettiest song. \\"Death On Two Legs\\" is a killer song the hardest rocker on the album. \\"Lazing on A Sunday\\" and \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" are really the same song but Rendezvous is a little better. All the other songs are great as well except for the ones without Freddie! So if you don't believe me about me about the other songs the get it for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" at least! Because that song is way worth the money alone!
0064407667|3.0|This book is a trap for kids, for whom I do not recommend it... it is too dark, too Goth, and twisted.<br />I do encourage parents to buy B0B-TALES, by Bob Morgan, a book of fifty children's bedtime stories... it is brand new, and terrific.
B0000029AP|5.0|I said that Aerosmiths album Rocks was their best album and it is as far as musical talent and musianship. But as a whole this is Aerosmith's finest hour. Though its not my favorite Aero-album its is by far their best record! This was the album that made Aerosmith the mega rock stars they were in the 1970's. Joe Perry and Brad Whitford are at their best on this album, more so Joe then Brad (rocks was Brads album) and it shows in all Joes riffs. Though \\"Round and Round\\" which is the hardest and heaviest song on the album belongs to Brad. I mean just look at the solo on \\"Walk This Way\\" it is Joe's finest moment, it made him a guitar god, and in my opinion the worlds greatest guitar player to ever walk the face of the Earth! \\"Toys In The Attic\\" Adams Apple\\" and \\"Round and Round\\" are the albums heaviest songs and all have great guitar riffs and solos! Joey and Toms rhythm section was at the top of its game here, and if you listen to the Aero-classic \\"Sweet Emotion\\" you will know why Tom Hamiltons is one of the greatest bass players to ever play, because its the worlds best bass line! Aerosmth always show their funk side and they do it well with my favorite song \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" which is the weakest track on the album but still a good song, well kinda! \\"Uncle Salty\\" is an Aerosmith classic you have to know the song to be a fan I mean its easily one of the best songs on the album, and one of Aerosmiths best songs over all for that matter. \\"No More No More\\" goes hand in hand with \\"Uncle Salty\\" and its a really good song about trying to make it in a band and giving it all you have with all these things holding  you back. \\"You See Me Crying\\" is the ballad to finish off the album which Steven had to have written about some chick, not this shows why Steven Tyler has the worlds greatest rock voice. There is no low point on this album, it is Aerosmiths best and if you don't own this you cant call yourself a Aerosmith fan! Even If you don't like Aerosmith all that much you will love this. If You were to Make A List \\"Toys In The Attic\\" would be in the top 10 albums of all time!all that much you will love this. If You were to Make A List \\"Toys In The Attic\\" would be in the top 10 albums of all time!
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Finally, Universal is giving their cult classics the special treatment they deserve!  Now, those of us who were unable to get a copy of the now OOP (out of print) Animal House DVD are going to get a special treat with the all new DOUBLE SECRET PROBATION Edition of Animal House on DVD!!!  Just in time for its 25th Anniversary as well!  I can't wait to get my copy this August!  What else can I say?<br />LET'S DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008MNYS|5.0|I've been a fan of Robbie's for a few years now (odd since I'm in the U.S.!) When I first listened to this disc, I was disappointed. I was expecting something like &quot;Sing When You're Winning.&quot; It's definitely not that album style. Upon listening a few more times, I love it. The songs are catchy and heart-felt. He's a little into the whole L.A. thing, but everybody's got to be into something.  He's been trying to figure out who he is, it seems, since his Take That days.<br />I encourage everyone into pop music to give Robbie a try. He's a lot of fun to listen to, pretty great to look at and is just one of those guys whose voice can melt a person. I also highly recommend &quot;Swing When You're Winning,&quot; for that Rat Pack good stuff. I'd say that's where he's at his best, but then I listen to another of his CDs and say the same for that one!
0440237688|5.0|With her masterpiece \\"The Giver\\", Lois Lowry creates a riveting tale about a nightmarish world.  The central character is a young boy named Jonas.  In his world, there is no war or fear or pain or color of any sort.  Upon reaching a certain age, each person is assigned a role or a duty in the community.  The role Jonas is assigned requires that he receive special training from \\"the giver\\".  The Giver is the only member of the community who contains memories of true pain and pleasure, and he must pass them on to Jonas...<br />Although it may seem cliched, a rip-off of so many sci-fi stories of dystopian worlds, \\"The Giver\\" separates itself from the pack.  This is a book that transcends generations of readers, so that grandparent and grandchild alike can find enjoyment in its pages.  And perhaps along the way we will learn something about the joys of life and individuality.  Highly recommended.<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of \\"Conquest of Paradise\\"
6305657947|4.0|I have to admit, I am not one for romance films. This film has to be the exception. John McTiernan, usually  known for high-octane action films such as \\"Predator\\" and \\"Die Hard,\\" crafts a wonderful tale of romance surrounding an art gallery thief and the insurance specialist sent to retrieve his 'booty' (please pardon the horrible pun!). The two leads, Rene Russo (who just owns the entire movie) and Pierce Brosnan are magnetic and wonderfully likeable characters. Its refreshing to see two leads who are the same age as one another, as opposed to a liason between an older man and a woman half his age. This gives the film even more credibility and makes it more fun to watch. The movie also boasts a wonderfully original and jazzy score by McTiernan partner Bill Conti; and who better to sing the fantastic version of \\"Windmills Of Your Mind\\" than the great Sting. As noted in the Amazon.com review, the film is more a cat and smarter cat movie than the cliched cat and mouse flick. Russo and Brosnan try to outthink and outsmart one another at each turn, often with clever results. The film is highly enjoyable and is sure to be one that you will enter into the 'repeat viewing' category. It certainly doesn't hurt that Rene Russo just oozes sexuality out of every pore of her body - I never realized how gorgeous she was until I saw this film! Great film for date night, or for watching with that special someone. Fun capers, great plot, wonderful leads and a razor sharp script make this one of the best films of 1999, and certainly one of Hollywood's more enjoyable romances in a LONG time!! Give it a shot, it might just 'steal' your heart!
B00009ATKS|3.0|Do you like Sigur Ros? Do you like Godspeed You Black Emperor? Do you like My Bloody Valentine's LOVELESS? Do you like the Cure's DISINTEGRATION?<br />Then you'll love this.
B00000JMOF|4.0|Say what you want about the creakiness of the plot and some of the seriously dated performance techniques that are quite laughable. <br />Say too what you may about the fact that this film has little in common with the gorgeous, poetic and romantic novel that brilliantly set up the 21st century debate of man versus technology. <br />But please enjoy Boris Karloff, possibly the most overlooked and underrated actor in film history presenting a masterful performance worthy of study and celebration. Karloff's creation is simply one of the finest performances ever captured on film. It is one of the two or three great performances never nominated for the Oscar.<br />Largely a carefully crafted pantomime creation from an actor trained on stage, the creature is not only terrifying, but hauntingly human and tragic. What Karloff is able to do with just the simplest of gesture or roll of the eye is what acting is all about: telling a truthful, electrifying and emotional story. <br />The academy and the industry underutilized this expert craftsman. Because of his odd looks, there was admittedly a limited market for him. However in many respects he was as good as Sir Olivier and could have been used in oh so many ways. I urge all to take a look at this film if for no other reason than to savor an expert example of acting for film.
B000006NPY|2.0|..of the Pumpkins. It's ok, and a must for any Pumpkins die-hard, but for those looking for the great Smashing Pumpkins, I suggest Gish, Siamese Dream and Pices Escariot.(Mellon Collie as well,there are GREAT tunes to be heard, but I think that collection's a bit bloated.)
0689859368|4.0|I really liked this book a lot!!! the story grabbed me...but the 1 downside was that it was extremely short! i'm sure that the whole chronicals could go into more like three books....but hey! the authers mak'n  more $$$ ...so who cares??<br />all in all... great book... a must read
B00008LDPU|5.0|This was very cool.  Interesting to see the different styles of animation.  Filled in some holes in the story.
B00005N5S5|3.0|I know this movie was made in '84, but the special effects were so bad i couldn't help but laugh. The entire second half of the movie arnold(aka the \\"Terminator\\") looked completely like a rubber puppet and when you see him at the end as a robot he looked like a cartoon. That aside, this movie has too little action and spends too much time with pointless romantic (and sexual) scenes as well as several boring flashbacks to the future (no pun intended). It never seemed to end. Just when you think the terminator is killed he pops up again. However for the few good action parts it provides, I give \\"the Terminator\\" 2 stars. As for the dvd, it will never amount to the sheer wealth of extras on T2's dVD treatment. The picture and sound are goodhere though, plus there are deleted scenes and documentaries. 4 stars for the DVD. In my opinion, I dont reccomend buying it, but if you havent seen it it is kind of a sci-fi classic and is worth watching at least once. My overall grade: 2.75 stars.
B00005JLEU|3.0|I bought this after all the hype surrounding it post oscar award.  everyone raved and raved about this movie..<br />It's an OK fairy tale with some semi-scary elements for small children.<br />I wasn't really pumped by this one.  It just kind was 'eh' once I was done.
0060977493|2.0|The worst book I have read so far. How on earth did it win the Booker Prize?! The story just goes on and on and at the end of it, I was left totally blank, not to forget, disgusted. <br />In the beginning (P 8, last line), I thought that Ammu had murdered some guy. However, it does not go beyond that. <br />The bit about the orangelemondrink guy is terribly disgusting.<br />Sophie Mol is unnecessarily killed. <br />The &quot;Viable Die-able age&quot; part got on my nerves. The poetry ending with &quot;Dum dum&quot; was silly. On P 327, what happens between Estha and Rahel?  <br />Most of the book is about the Church and then suddenly, there is that part on Kathakali dancers. What was the idea behind that?? For that matter, what was the idea behind the entire book?? <br />OK, I do agree that some parts of it were funny. For instance Comrade Pillai's english, his son's little speech and oh, his niece's poetry recital. The part on people at the airport waiting to receive their &quot;American&quot; and &quot;English&quot; relatives is funny and true. However, the morbidness of the entire story overpowers these bits of humor. <br />A Glossary of Terms would have been helpful. <br />To sum it up, a morbid drag. Please do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B00005JLRT|2.0|I can't even begin to describe how disappointing this was. <br />TNG will always be my favorite ST and to have it end on this note is truly sad. Finally breaking the tradition of even numbered movies being better - the responsibility of this disaster lies squarely on the shoulders of the director. They might as well have gotten John Woo - after all if you're going to destroy a franchise why not get someone with experience (ie. Mission Impossible II)<br />The cast is still the strongest of the ST franchises and is the only reason this isn't getting a one star review. There's also a nice cameo by Janeway. Pity they couldn't come up with a better script than this. Worst of all the deja vu ending (circa Wrath of Khan) leaves even the non ST fans thinking \\"Hmm this looks strangely familiar\\"<br />I have every ST: TNG DVD but I think I'm going to pretend that this didn't happen. Only slightly better than Insurrection.<br />Gene must be turning in his grave.
B0000524CY|5.0|I just watched &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for the first time the other night. Yes I was all alone, and yes it was the middle of the night and all the lights were out, but no this film is nowhere near as scary as people make it out to be. It definetly had its creepy moments, and there were a few parts that made me cringe, but I honestly don't see what people are so terrified of. <BR>Scariness aside this was an excellent, powerful drama with incredible performances from all involved. I have only seen the newer extended version so I cannot comment on which version is better, but I imagine that people like better whichever version they see first. It seems that more was added character, and story wise rather than horror moments. So maybe that is why some people were dissapointed with this newer edition. I myself thought the story flowed very nicely, and I actually cared about the characters by the end of the film. The dvd itself had great video quality, and an awesome 5.1 audio mix. Plus a decent bit of extras including a feature length commentary with the director. I would recommend this film to all horror, and even drama fans, but if your expecting to be absolutely horrified then you may come away a bit dissapointed.
B000002MTR|3.0|This disc really shows how John Frusciante influenced the sound of the chilis. If they thought that the guitar on Mother's Milk was overpowering than they should listen to OHM. Dave Navarro's style of guitar does not fit the Chili Peppers. <BR>Warped - great lyrics but without them it flops.<BR>Aeroplane - great song one of the best on the album except for the chanting kids at the end.<BR>Deep Kick - a good song but imagine how Frusciante would have done it<BR>My Friends - one of two songs that I can imagine the chilis recording without Navarro. sounds like an acoustic classic<BR>Coffee shop - Good Rock song.

0385335482|5.0|This book actually made me laugh out loud.  I suppose it's embarrassing to admit, but I easily related to the main character, Rebecca, and her shopping escapades.  What woman hasn't gone through the endless justification of unnecessary purchases, swearing &quot;this is it - after this, I'll buy no more,&quot;? <BR>A recovering shopaholic myself, I found this novel a true delight to read.  Kinsella does a wonderful job of creating a protagonist that the reader can laugh at, and laugh with, as she fumbles her way through life - and credit card bills.
1573225517|3.0|maybe its because i read this book in 2003 and it was written in 1995 when the references to different bands just doesnt hold up as much anymore or maybe its that i saw the movie first and the movie takes place in america but i didnt feel this book carries the stigma of being as great as i heard it was. i felt it dragging too much
B00009TB5G|5.0|I see a lot of people have touched on the changes that were made in the movie so I will manage to make this review fairly short. I loved the books, they were quite possibly some of the most interesting and incredible books I've read to date, and so far I think Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job with them. When reading the books i knew Two Towers would be the hardest to create on film. Some of the Ent stuff was a bit iffy, but I was able deal with that. My biggest two complaints were those of Arwen and Faramir. They spent altogether probably 45 minutes on the two, and let me say it completely changes some of the images that I think Tolkien wanted set. The Arwen stuff was[bad]. Yes, I understand Liv Tyler is beautiful, trust me. Yes I understand they want to build a love story, but please dont waste so much time on it. Faramir was supposed to be the opposite of Boromir. He was supposed to be a hero and lived on his principles and very forgiving. The whole thing about going wherever they went was another huge waste of time. With that time they definitely could have given the Ents a much bigger part, or perhaps stayed to the story line with Frodo and his crew. <br />But, now that i have complained, I am just going to say that the movie as a whole is absolutely awesome. I think the elves coming to help was sweet (but could have been sweeter in the next movie) and Helm's Deep was awesome. Great movie.
B00008DDSC|3.0|Maggie Gyllenhaal manages to take an incredibly complex role and make it watchable.  Lee is a young girl with a history of psychological problems that have led to destructive and suicidal behavior.  After a brief glimpse of the sophisticated submissive that she becomes, the story is told in flashback beginning with her release from a psychiatric facility.  Coming home to a timid and nervous mother, it's easy to question how effective her treatment was when she immediately takes shelter in her room and reverently fondles the knives that she's used to cut herself in the past.<br />She applies for a secretarial job with Edward, a strangely detached attorney played by James Spader (a few years ago this role would have gone to Christopher Walken).  It quickly becomes evident that his performance standards are not necessarily within the norms of conventional office conduct, more apropos of a dungeon than an office.  But Lee discovers a bond (no pun intended) that she had never before imagined, and the interplay between secretary and boss, master and submissive becomes fascinating to watch.  At times it becomes questionable as to who is manipulating who.  But it's clear that these are two very strange personalities that have drifted into a very symbiotic and ultimately beneficial relationship.<br />If images of sadomasochism and bondage will offend you, stay clear of this.  But for a very complex character study, it's difficult to top.  I can't necessarily say that I would like to have Edward and Lee as next door neighbors, but it is nice that they could find each other.
B00009V7T2|5.0|With the scene filled to the brim with similar-sounding bands, thank God TMV didn't continue with the same blueprint of At the Drive-In. TMV is much smarter, funkier and psycodelic. Because its a concept album, it must be listened through all the way through. In this way, the band is much like the much-revered 'dredg'. The vocals have vastly improved, taking a less anthem approach and opting for a role much more integrated with the music. I absolutely love the fact that the lyrics are not straightforward, giving the listener an active role to decide upon what every song means to him/her. Because of the variety in delivery, this album could be listened to while doing almost anything!
B000089RVX|5.0|I have bought many cds and they always seemed to be missing something. The songs were just 'ok' and the lyrics insignificant and without substance.. then I discovered Evanescence. From day one of getting their cd my musical expectations changed. I was inspired by their poetic lyrics and powerful music. Amy Lee has a beautiful and strong voice that adds to the greatness of the cd. Evanescence has a great unique sound.Every song shows much effort into making this an awesome cd. I believe they have succeeded. I look forward to hearing great success from them! Thank you Evanescence for a refreshing and compelling record.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Let me start by saying that this by FAR not Miyazaki Hayao's best film. It won't touch you as My Neighbor Totoro will, nor will it amaze you as Kiki's Delivery Service will. BUT what it will do is take you to a fantasy world. And what wonderful world it is. <br />The film shows the sheer artistic genius that is Miyazaki. This film seems like an explosion of his imagination, from Yuubaba to No Face. Spirited Away is a film about growing up, finding your place in this world. Chihiro is actually based on a real ten-year-old, she is one of Miyazaki's friend's daughter. He (Miyazaki) wanted to ask people that &quot;she is very happy right now, but as she grows up, will she be able to withstand the pressure the world gives?&quot; <br />Yes, this is NOT Miyazaki's best, yet it deserves the title to be the highest grossing film in Japan, and the Oscar. As a magazine said, &quot;if Spirited Away didn't win the Oscar, they might as well erase the category Best Animated Film altogether.&quot; <br />SIDE NOTE: If anyone cares, there are rumors that Spirited Away was made because of one song (the ending song, I couldn't remember the name right now) sung by fan, also an unknown musician. The funny thing is, the song was actually submitted for another movie! It was submitted for... uh, my memory has somehow gone blank right now, so I can't remember the film... Something like _name_, The Chimney Cleaner or Chimney Boy or...
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is a great accomplishment - a film which captures so much in the very confined space of one Hollywood soundstage, complete with articifial daylight and the sounds of an urban neighbourhood. But that is just a small part of the genius - Hitchcock manages to draw together several visual ideas with a number of underlying messages and come up with a movie that could be anything from comic entertainment to an intuitive social commentary - you decide! <br />Perhaps the best aspects of the movie are the relationships - be they between neighbours, employees, friends or lovers - the audience is drawn in and the 'voyeur watching voyeur' aspect becomes all the more ironic. James Stewart is fantastic as the recuperating photographer who cannot find anything to do except watch the comings and goings of people in his apartment block. Thelma Ritter, as his nurse/housekeeper, has some of the best one-liners. And Grace Kelly as his love interest is in truly stunning form - both in terms of her acting and physical presence (I think I fell in love with her when I first saw this movie - and I was only 10 years old). <br />If you want to know what all the fuss is about when it comes to movies of this era, do get this - you will enter a world of sophistication you might never have known existed. Highly recommended!
0312983867|4.0|I just finished this book today and it was a good book but not as funny as the previous books.  Some of the things that happen in Hard Eight has happened in the previous books and I think that Janet has to look at getting some fresh ideas.  I will definitely read To The Nines!!!!  This series is far from being dead, but could use some freshing up on the storylines.
B00004Z400|5.0|I took a liking to this cd right away. Maybe it's because I'm used to albums that need time to grow on you... but there's plenty of stuff here to keep even the most attention-deprived listeners interested. I like the lyrics a lot. Beauty, sadism, bitterness and alienation are some good descriptive words of the lyrics and the overall sound of this album.<br />Some stand out tracks are &quot;Back to School&quot; (Deftone's F-U to the popular kids), &quot;Digital Bath&quot; (The &quot;wall of sound&quot; technique is used very well here), &quot;Change&quot; (I love the lyrics and how they are sung. Timing and emotional impact both very acute) and of course &quot;Passenger&quot; (The brilliant Mr. Keenan guest stars).<br />They're all good songs, though. And they get better with time.<br />Worth every star. The best Deftones album.
B00005JM09|4.0|Yes, the lady terminator was designed to control other machines, but no, the computers in modern cars cannot steer the vehicles.  Even if controlled by cyborgs of the future.  I'll buy that the lady terminator was able to control the crane's support feet and arm while in motion, but not self-steering cars.  Sorry, that soured the milk for the entire car chase scene.<br />And I am sick and tired of seeing computer viruses in movies.  At least they weren't misused as bad as they were in Independence Day, but almost as bad is the notion of SkyNet's AI living distributed in all the computers connected to the Internet.  Sorry, all the Windows and Macintosh boxes in the world could never create a thinking machine.  They hardly function as it is.<br />Other than that, I loved the baby SkyNet machines that were let loose upon humanity.  And I don't recall any love scenes of any significance.  That's always a big plus.
6305252521|3.0|Nothing is like it seems to be. The today media culture offers a lot of human stories in the TV-landscape. 24 hours of destinations, lies and Talkshows. Problem of every kinds of television-projects like soaps, talkshows or Big Brother is that it is reality, but every person plays a roll in this drama. So: what is the next step in the media culture? <br />The Truman Show brings us to the next step. Real reality show. An interesting film about this future. Nice to see, but in the end a bit dry. Truman has to die on his way to step outside (t)his world. And the whole world keeps watching. And nobody helps. Thirty years Truman lived in this worls calles Seahaven. Nobody cares about his feelings. Only Sylvia. A good reflector of the modern media world. 90 percent egoism and 10 percent solidarity. Good shown in this movie. An Truman is only one example for this society-mirror. Talent Shows like American Idol brings everyshow. An interesting film about this future. Nice to see, but in the end a bit dry. Truman has to die on his way to step outside (t)his world. And the whole world keeps watching. And nobody helps. Thirty years Truman lived in this worls calles Seahaven. Nobody cares about his feelings. Only Sylvia. A good reflector of the modern media world. 90 percent egoism and 10 percent solidarity. Good shown in this movie. An Truman is only one example for this society-mirror. <br />Problem of this film is only the fact, that it is a product of Hollywood too. A classical happy end story that keeps every shock from the viewer away. So it lost its thought provoking character.
B000001EGE|5.0|Does anybody really know what \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" is about?  Then again, does anybody really care?  The song is soooo rich and enchanting, and the lyrics so cryptic, that you're able to interpret the song however you choose.  \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" is thus an indispensable track among the ten timeless tunes on this album. <br />Indeed, Honky Chateau is another of the masterpieces from the beginning of Elton John's extraordinary musical career. This album, produced at the early stages of the Elton John/Bernie Taupin frenzy during the early 1970's, easily showcases the extraordinary talent of a man who has become one of the most legendary and world-renowned popular musicians ever.  <br />Honky Chateau demonstrates the wide range of music Elton and Bernie could capably deliver.  With its syncopated rhythm and infectious melody, it's no wonder that \\"Honky Cat\\" became a huge hit.  Of course everyone knows \\"Rocket Man,\\" a poignant song capturing the life perspective of an astrounaut, a topic that's most unique in contemporary music.  The third widely known song from this album is \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,\\" which ranks on my list of all-time favorite tunes.  <br />This album contains more than the big hits we've all heard on the radio, however.  \\"Susie\\" is a driving, pulsating rocker that even today, after all these years, still beckons you to hit the 'repeat' button on your CD player.  The gospel-oriented \\"Salvation\\" is a delightful blend with the bluesy \\"Mellow.\\"   A remarkable country-pop-rock-soul combination overrides this album with songs such as \\"Amy,\\" \\"Hercules,\\" and \\"Slave.\\"  The irony of \\"I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself\\" is craftily delivered in a message that belies the song's upbeat melody and performance.  With so many well crafted songs, it's obvious that the greatest asset of Honky Chateau is the masterful songwriting behind each and every track on this disc.  When Elton John and Bernie Taupin were writing music together in the early 70's,they were dynamite.   <br />With the marvels of technology, today we're able to enjoy a digitally remastered version of Honky Chateau.  What a treat it is to hear this album shimmering through digital channels on high-performance speakers!  Music just doesn't get any better than this.<br />If you're thinking of taking a stroll down memory lane, or if you're considering a history lesson to discover the treasures of Elton John's early work, I'd highly recommend Honky Chateau.  It's a magnificent album.
B00004T9UF|5.0|ok well i am a big Eminem fan and i think that he is a very talented person to be able to write and then rap/sing/say his own lyrics i think it is also unfair how he has to keep proveing him self to the world if people dont like him then why do they insist on makeing a big deal out of it..ya know where i come from if ya dont like something ya keep it to ya self and ya dont go nuts and turn every body against it not that any one could but if you dont like his music dont listen to it and dont complain read me i sad DONT! not do but DONT ok? so from now on stop fussing over it and stick to your own music that you do like and dont complain about what other people like ok?? <BR>thanx
B00008OWZC|5.0|I didn't comprehend the magnitude of Led Zeppelin until I heard How the West was Won.  I have always like Led and have progressed as a fan as most in my generation, starting at IV and slowly uncovering the wealth of music from other albums.  When I heard this album, I immediately understood why Zeppelin has been called the greatest rock band of all time.  The CD opening of The Immigrant Song and Heartbreaker, which are strung together flawlessly, thunders right through you.  You have to blast it every time you hear it.  Other highlights on the CD include Over the Hills and Far Away, That's the Way, What is and What Should Never Be, Whole Lotta Love, Dancing Days, and The Ocean.  Almost all of the songs, which are refreshing step away from the studio recordings, are magical and full of energy.  Perhaps some of the songs are a little long, but it still made me feel like I needed to be at a Zeppelin concert.  But this CD is the next best thing.  This CD blows basically every modern \\"rock\\" artist away and I would recommend it to anyone who considers himself a fan of rock music.
0066620996|5.0|I have been in business for 25 years mostly as a top executive for Xeorx and then Intel. I consider it my obligation to continue to improve myself at every level in order to maintain my career and stay ahead of the internal competition. To me it is not just a credo it is a way of life and one that has served me well over the years and put three girls through college. Nothing has ever helped more than improving my leadership skills. My top two books this quarter are mostly bestsellers such as Emotionally Charged Learning by Eric Schiffer and \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins. Emotionally Charged Learning taught me how to be a better \\"knowledge\\" oriented leader which gives me more power to have my employees better excel. Good to Great taught me to take another look at what really works. These books have been essential to me and my ongoing success.
B000002549|5.0|In short, this is a beautiful piece of artistic integrity and interpretation.  Although classical pundits might snub the work because its vocalist is known primarily for her popular music, what such vapid haughtiness fails to appreciate is that music is a transaction between composer and singer.  As a performing arts major in college, what I take for granted that others may not realize is that upon receiving input and feedack from either a director or conductor, a sensitive rendering of either a play's character or piece of music is best left up to the TALENT of the performer!  Otherwise, rather than receiving a holistic portrayal, an audience is liable to witness imitation rather than artistic interpretation.  Withal, although many can be &quot;classically trained,&quot; only a few have a genuine gift.
B00005JLRT|4.0|For the most part, the New Generation series of movies have felt like long TV episodes and not major movies and this continues here.  The DVD is nice with a sharpe picture and sound and the deleted scenes were fun but the scenes not done were the key to this film's downfall.<br />I think we have waited 15 years or so to see Riker and Troi marry and what do we get...the reception, but no wedding...no Picard doing the ceremony...no Worf frettng under his breathe...no Data head turn as the humans swoon....  We have waited a long time to see Riker get his own ship and what do we get, a nice scene between Picard and Riker but no Captain Riker on his bridge taking the Titan out for his first voyage as Captain.<br />Those are the moments Trekkers would have lived for, but were lacking.  <br />The movie is OK, but like the last two, does not have that Major Motion picture feel to it.
B000069HKH|4.0|Let's face the facts...Springsteen could have written and recorded 13 hip-hop tunes about his grandmother and reviewers would have given it four stars and espoused him as visionary once again.<br />But Springsteen never has been the kind to take the easy way. After Sept. 11, a lot of things changed. While Toby Keith and Daryl Worley and a host of other country artists espoused fighting, striking and beating the Muslim terrorists into submission, Springsteen took a step back for almost a year, as he has always been a careful man. <br />He had been touring with the E Street Band and had been singing and writing songs about brotherhood, about life and love on the other side of 50. That changed, drastically and quickly.<br />It can be seen on the opening track of \\"Lonesome Day\\" where Springsteen sings \\"It'll be all right/ If I can just get through this Lonesome Day.\\" It's an answer for those who mourned the losses of Sept. 11, it'll be all right. He sings that vengeance may not be the best remedy, and he sings that loneliness can be healed. It's a message of community, not a message of spite.<br />With this album, he wrote the most important music of his career, focusing on healing, community, freedom, thought and hope. A lesser artist could have failed and fallen into the ranks of the cliched with this purpose, but Springsteen does not.<br />He delievers every step of the way, from the languid, achingly beautiful \\"Worlds Apart,\\" which mizes not only a love story, but the Muslim and Christian worlds coming to a head, to the rocking \\"The Rising,\\" in which Springsteen focuses on the true beauty in living while you're alive.<br />He delivers on \\"My City of Ruins,\\" a love song to Asbury Park that became the perfect timepiece to recollect what New York was, and also held hope for what New York could be. He delivers on \\"Paradise,\\" a haunting tune about devotion to family and God, coming to terms with the fanaticism that led to the post-Sept. 11 world.<br />Most importantly, Springsteen delivers by being what he has always been. A voice of understanding during a time that no one understands.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is one of the best albums to listen to for those who are looking for music to help relax.  Its celtic and irish new age combination allows Enya to sing more expressively, which she does splendidly.  &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; proves that Enya is one of the best new age performers and composers worldwide.  She's also outstanding at playing all her own instruments.  &quot;Only Time&quot; stands out emotionally.  It's the perfect dedication to the victims of 9/11.  This album's musical evolution will likely make one excited for her next album.  Hopefully, there's not another five-year gap between album releases.  However, if she continues her musical evolution as she did between the last two albums, it will be worth the wait.
B00006LIRI|3.0|U2 is a band that is held to a higher standard. They were the best in the music business for a stretch--about 1986-1991. No one could compare to what U2 did, mixing their Irish blood with American roots music. No one could write about pain, sorrow and heartache, hope and dreams like Bono did in the Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum. No one was even close, during a time when soullessness seemed the norm. Instead of &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; U2 competed with &quot;Pump Up The Jam&quot; and they won.<br />They changed their style in 1991 and drowned out much of their bluesish sound, but Bono's spirit drove the band to it's highest point. &quot;One&quot; is U2's standard. Which makes it unfortunate, because the rest of this record is good, but not &quot;One.&quot; It's also unfortunate because not many artists get to write a song like &quot;One,&quot; excepting the Beatles (Let It Be).<br />It's almost preposterous to put Discotheque on the same record because they aren't performed by the same band in many respects. But that is the band that U2 was in the 90s, a band that reached majestically high (One, Mysterious Ways, Stuck in a Moment and Staring at the Sun) and also just reached (Discotheque, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Numb). <br />But even if U2 is a band that hasn't been what it was in a while, they are getting better. You can see it in the songs from All That You Can't Leave Behind. &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; and &quot;Stuck in a Moment&quot; are songs with undeniable energy and rawness that U2 hasn't had since Rattle and Hum.<br />And even more important, the two new songs are both up to the standard that &quot;One&quot; set. &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; is the best U2 song in a decade. Bono's vocals are what they were when he recorded &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name.&quot; The Edge's guitar is delicate and beautiful when used, although the atmosphere of the song is almost too thick (like an electrical storm) to allow the guitar to get through. The lyrics are beautiful, the story of two lovers deciding the next step and holding on to each other because there is nothing else to do.  It's a thick song, the kind that leaves you emotionally drained after it, and it's the kind that U2 has always excelled at.<br />&quot;The Hands That Built America&quot; is no less powerful and no less dense, it's only the subject matter that changes. Bono's voice is at his strongest in this music and both songs give hope that U2 will not soon forget the emotion that they once had in making music about people--lovers, immigrants, rebels, singers and dreamers alike.<br />If their next album is like these two songs, not only would U2 be the best again, they will have reached that higher standard that sets this collection off as mediocre, only because of the potential that the decade began and ended with.
B00003CXFV|5.0|\\"Erin Brockovich\\" proves that you don't need a college degree to make a difference in the world.  This true story was wonderfully written and directed By Stephen Soderborgh.  He has his unique styles in displicting certain important scenes so the audience can understand the deeper atmosphere that these characters are in.  Julia Roberts was well-deserving of her Oscar for Best Actress for the portrayal of this feisty, strong-willed woman.  Her emotional and financial struggles prove that there is always hope for a brighter future.  The real-life Brockovich isn't a bad actress as performed in her small role as a waitress.  The screenplay has many creative words giving it a broader emotional edge.  Some are funny.  This will force the audience to listen closer to what every character says, especially Brockovich.<br />I've owned this movie for two years, and I still find new and better reasons to love it everytime I watch it.  I'm sure you'll think the same.

0689829590|2.0|I bought this book for my 11-month son who is very hard on regular books.  Unfortunately, he will not get to read it until he is much older because the fold-out pages are much too flimsy for a board book.<br />I was very disappointed to bring it home from the store and have the page with the moon that unfolds tear just from me opening those two pages.<br />The book is very very pretty, I just wish it were more durable.  I don't see how a child could avoid damaging it.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki with Sharon L. Lechter is an outstanding book.  Overall this book is very helpful because it describes certain objectives that people should do in order to achieve financial freedom, as well as providing the tools an individual will need to make a lifestyle change in the way one spends and saves his/her money.  This book helps to reshape the way a person may start to think about finances and money.  Robert Kiyosaki's book helps to keep things in perspective with life and money.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is definitely not a book that claims to bring quick wealth, but is a book that gives a person the opportunity to acquire a successful business/finance foundation.  <BR>     Kiyosaki has pointed out that people in their everyday lives find themselves in debt traps.  He explains that credit card debts and mortgage payments have become so prevalent among individuals that they are willing to do whatever it takes by doing everything possible since their income is decreasingly low compared to their credit card debts and mortgage payments.  Furthermore, in Kiyosaki's book, he has two dads, one real dad and a close friends dad who taught him to take risks and told him how to get rid of debt habits as well as how to get rich by starting off with small but wise investments.  In his book, Kiyosaki feels that many people can change their financial habits from being a compulsive spender to a careful and wise investor.  This book has definitely helped me prepare for my future career goals and hopefully many others will soon adhere to wise choices and decisions in their everyday lives.  Overall, I believe this book is a guide to an ideal American life.  <BR>Reading this book may change an individuals overall perspective on life, business, real estate, and finance and hopefully will make a change and/or difference for whom ever reads this wonderful book.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Tower Towers was the best movie of 2002. Alone, I'm not sure it was better than Fellowship of the Ring, and this year's The Return of the King will be the best of the three. <br />I would wait to buy the Exented Edition of the Two Towers, released in November. If the EE of Fellowship is any sign, the EE of Two Towers will add so much to the story. I cannot now imagine watching the theater version of Fellowship, the EE is such a superior presentation. Besides, Fellowship's EE came with a free ticket to the Two Towers! Given the price of the movies these days, a free ticket to Return of the King is a great incentive to wait for the EE of Two Towers!
B00000IMCW|5.0|The Second entry in George Romero's &quot;Dead Trilogy&quot; Dawn of the Dead, picks up after Night of the living Dead, we see that the living dead have begun to overrun us, and evacuation is ordered, the story revolves around a group of 4 (2 Swat team members, and 2 newssstation emploies) the 4 journie through america this is one point were Romero's social commentaries comes through to make the film even better, eventually the 4 make it to a shopping center and barricade themselves in, not before having to engage in battles with the living dead already in the mall, but as time passes we see how life is somewhat normal in the mall between them, but there normality does not last long untill a band of scavengers make their way into the mall letting in legions of the undead (I might have exagerated on legions, maybe hundreds and hundreds, maybe even a thousand). Romero's film not only deliveres Zombie Action, and moments of horror, he manages to give his movie a moral, or personal reflection of what one man saw, and with that he gave us a view of a society crumbling, a race on the verge of extinction, and as the end nears we see that no meteor, or God destroys us, We destroyed ourselves.
B000002UVX|5.0|The title is in response to another reviewer's ridiculous assertion that white people didn't dig The Band of Gypsys because they were all black. As far as I know, the record sold well with Hendrix's white audience.  Anyway - I LOVE this release, always have since the day I picked up my first copy on vinyl at Target in 1971.  Miles and Cox provide an incredible, driving, funky groove.  It's a shame Hendrix's manager was such a jerk and hell bent on breaking up the Band of Gypsys.  Easily Hendrix's most impressive playing on ANY of his releases.  Buy it.  If you want to hear what could have been and where Jimi was headed, also pick up Miles Davis's Agharta.<br />Gotta go and pick the hayseed out of my teeth.<br />Out!
B00006690G|5.0|I just became a huge fan of Eminem.  I borrowed some cd's from a friend and I love his music.  He has such talent.  My favorite is The Eminem Show.  It has now become my driving cd.

B000099T2L|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to this CD. Usually not my style of musical choice, but the more I listened the more my appreciation for Beyonce grew. <BR>To summarize, let's start with:<BR>1. The musical arrangement. Very proffecionally done. Although there are some songs that are solely for radio play as a whole the CD has its own flare and ambiance all through out.<BR>2. The lyrics. I was impressed with the writing abilities and the depth of the lyrics of most ofthe songs. It is refreshing to hear lyrics that are not full of curse words (like other R&B and Hip Hop artists do), but have some meaning and actually make you listen to them. If I can describe the lyrics with one word it will be \\"soulful\\". <BR>3. The Ganre. This was the first thing that grabbed my attention. Every song has its own beat and you can actually destinguish between songs and don't feel like listening to only one 50-some minute song. And at the same time they were put together in a perfect order. But back to the ganre or the variety of ganres as I discovered listening to the CD. The remarcable thing is that this album included as well as R&B, Soul, and Hip-Hop, a new fresh mixing of arabic tunes in a couple of songs and even one song reminded me of great Jazz legends like Ella Fitzgerald. And finally the classic: \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" Duet with Luther Vandross just fits perfectly in this CD. This song which has been performed by many greats like Roberta Flack, Patty Austin and even Tom Jones only establishes Beyonce as one of the greatest vocalists and entertainers in the last decade.(Note: This song is not for hardcore Destiny's Child fans)<BR>Finally, if a hard core rock fan such as me can appreciate this CD and enjoy it I believe that everyone with respect for music should have it in their selection.
B000002N2P|5.0|By taking a different approach here than on their punk/grunge debut Dookie, Green Day produces what should be, indisputably, their greatest accomplishment to date.  As middle-of-the-road as Insomniac appears to punk enthusiasts who turned on Green Day for taking the road less traveled, it's amazing to hear how unblemished it really is.  This album holds their best song to date, \\"Brain Stew\\", along with numerous tracks that are hidden gems that only a few people justly know about (i.e. \\"Panic Song\\", \\"Westbound Sign\\", \\"Stuart And The Ave.\\", \\"Armatage Shanks\\", etc).  Their lyrics here are either paradoxical, naïve, smart, extremely negative, secluded, or cynical; each aspect seems to attach itself to its specific song.  When they're not working together, of course.  Do not expect this CD to sound like Dookie.  Instead, brace yourself for 14 unbelievably great songs.  Here's an overview:<br />1. Armatage Shanks - 5/5 - a perfect start.  Starts with: `stranded... lost inside myself', followed later by `I must insist on being a pessimist'.  Aside from the excellent lyrics, which are right to the point, the drum work is some of the best Green Day's ever done.<br />2. Brat - 5/5 - one minute, 42 seconds of an altered procrastination (waiting for your parents to die so you can inherit their money) provides for one of my personal favorite songs.  How this song went so overlooked is beyond me.  A definite highlight.<br />3. Stuck With Me - 3.5/5 - one of the few overrated songs on Insomniac.  It's a decent song--don't get me wrong--it just doesn't outdo most of the other songs that didn't quite make it to International Superhits!; the songs I wish had made it there.<br />4. Geek Stink Breath - 5/5 - another one of my favorites.  The line `wish in one hand / shxt in the other / and see which one gets filled first' is one of the album's finest excerpts.  It's pretty straightforward as far as its words.  It's the music that stands out.<br />5. No Pride - 4.5/5 - the personal favorites just keep on coming... here's yet another.  My 4.5-out-of-five rank is rather misleading, I just believe it's harder to love this song when some of the others outperform it.  Flawless exhibition of how to sing a chorus beautifully hard.<br />6. Bab's Uvula Who? - 3.5/5 - a very fast-paced song that might lose a couple of people.  Unless you actually read the lyrics you'll most likely miss everything aside from `...all wound up'.  It's an intriguing track that will grow on you over time.<br />7. 86 - 5/5 - if the title doesn't inform you what \\"86\\" is all about, you'll miss the point completely.  The lyrics say it all.  Another greatly overlooked tune that is right up there with the best of this band.<br />8. Panic Song - 5/5 - here is, quite possibly, the best song on the album; it's my favorite at least.  The first half of the song is instrumental, which might lead some of you to believe it stays that way.  It does not.  \\"Panic Song\\" features the best quotable line I've ever heard in a song: `the world is a sick machine / breeding a mass of shxt / with such a desolate conclusion / fill the void with... I don't care'.  Awesome; just awesome.<br />9. Stuart And The Ave. - 5/5 - short, sweet, and somewhat pop-ish (in a punk sort of way).  It's becoming tiresome for me to tell you how great the lyrics are and how underrated these darn songs are.  Get the idea?<br />10. Brain Stew - 5/5 - somehow this one separates itself from the rest of the songs.  The meticulous, drumless onset proves to be just one of the many brilliancies it possesses.  It's my 13th favorite song of all-time, and of any band.  Classically rocking, classically great.<br />11. Jaded - 3.5/5 - an unavoidable, hard to understand outro to \\"Brain Stew\\", basically.  It made it to International Superhits!, but probably for the wrong reasons.<br />12. Westbound Sign - 5/5 - this one is also a bit hard to understand, but it seems more purposeful and worthy of mention than the previous track.  It's alsoa breakup/love song; something that's a rare find on Insomniac.  Should've made it to Superhits!, but that's already become old hat here.<br />13. Tight Wide Hill - 3/5 - my least favorite song on the album.  Still good, but it just doesn't compare to \\"Armatage Shanks\\", \\"Brat\\", \\"Stuck With Me\\", \\"Geek Stink Breath\\", \\"No Pride\\", \\"Bab's Uvula Who?\\", \\"86\\", \\"Panic Song\\", \\"Stuart And The Ave.\\", \\"Brain Stew\\", \\"Jaded\\", or \\"Westbound Sign\\".<br />14. Walking Contradiction - 5/5 - apart from the ambiguously funny lyrics and the classic punk rock sound that this finale provides, the video is also great.  It's probably Green Day's best video to date.  You've probably heard the song already anyways.  Splendid!<br />I cannot emphasize enough how amazing Insomniac is.  And my five-out-of-five rank on nine of the 14 tracks should single-handedly make you want to buy this album, if you haven`t already.  If you've heard either \\"Brain Stew\\" or \\"Walking Contradiction\\", rest assured they are not the only great songs.  In fact, a number of the other songs are actually better (a tactic unlike Dookie and Warning's).  Billie Joe's lyrical abilities don't outweigh the music, and the music doesn't overshadow the words.  Insomniac is a perfect example of how to balance the two.  I'm not going to keep twisting your arm on this one.  If you aren't convinced yet you're not a Green Day fan, and, in all probability, you'll never be.  This is one of the best rock CDs to come out of the `90s.

B000002J09|5.0|Hi my name is Ryan and I'm fifteen.  I have many things to say, and one those things is this:  Led Zepellin 4 rocks!  It was made at the hight of their career, and there is nothing else like it.  If you want, you can skip the rest of the review and go buy it, and I almost guarantee that you will like it.  Even if your not exactly a Zep fan, it is still worth buying, if only to show your friends that you have a little taste.  <br />This was the first Zep album I bought, and it eventually led (no pun intended) me to buy the rest of their albums up to Houses of the Holy.  It is what I'd call a hard rock album, but it is really in more of a class of its own.  It is the album with the classic song Stairway to Heaven.  I would like to think that in hundreds of years people will still be listening to that song. It is art.  I'm not going to go over any other songs, except to say that they are all outstanding.  <br />It seems that among many of the reviews, there is controversy over whether this is Zep's best album or not.  Some people believe that it is over-rated and should not have been as popular as it is when they have plenty of other great albums.  I'm not going to say whether it's their best, because it is all a matter of opinion when it comes to such a title.  I do believe I know, though, why it is their most successful.  Polish.  That is it.  It is that perfect sense of polish that sets it apart from their first three albums.  Led Zep 1, 2, and 3 are extremely good; they have style, originality, are amazingly skillful and are great for playing loud, just like any great rock album, and just like Zep 4.  However, Zep 4 screams \\"classic!\\" more than the others because its polish makes it feel like a complete album with a perfect beginning, middle, and an end.  I think it is comparable to Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon because even though not every song will not be your favorite, every song will feel like it belongs in the album.  Led Zepellin flows perfectly from Black Dog to When the Levee Breaks because each song feels like it is in the right place at the right time, and no two songs feel redundent.  Enjoy ...
B00003CXXM|4.0|The brillance of the book, to me, is the mystery of who, or better yet, what is this man.  The original miniseries caught part of that, but poor casting hurt the story.  This DVD changes the beginning to speed onto the special effects, sacrificing the main character's slowly piecing together who he is and who he would have been if not a paid killer.  His &quot;new life&quot; changes the whole atmosphere. [see &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; for comparison]<br />The DVD is excellent and the action is super, but 5 stars means all &quot;it could be&quot;.  I bought it and am pleased I did.  As a past movie critic, I rated &quot;entertainment  and critic&quot; separately as the fun and the art should never be confused.
0887307280|2.0|Gerber has good concepts.  Work on your business, instead of working for your business.  Plan and organize as if the business was a franchise prototype, to be run by anyone.  He talks about strategies, from organization, to managerial, to systems.  He emphasizes long term and precise planning.  He emphasizes research and separate task appropriation.  All good ideas that should be implemented, but nothing revolutionary or nothing that doesn't include good common sense.<br />However, realizing that he can't sell a pamphlet, he decides to write a book with wishy washy philosophical nonsense accompanied with dialogue between him and a supposed entrepreneurial.  Since he uses exact quotes, and the language style of the entrepreneurial is exactly the same as his own, it's got to be fake.  Almost insultingly so.  I find it hard to believe that he taped and transcribed every meeting with \\"Sarah\\", a women who has an amazing knack of asking the most perfect and opportune questions in the same tone and style as the author. <br />The philosophical rants that he goes on is repetitive, dull, and often unnecessary.  He just goes on and on.  Then the little spiel about how you should use his service in the end makes the book feel cheap and almost like an informercial than a book.<br />Basically, it's all an advertisement to his service.  Don't buy this book.  It's a rip-off.
B00005JM09|5.0|Banking success once again, the Terminator 3 movie was fantastic. With an invigorating blend of humor, suspense, action, and landmark special effects, it is sure to become the newest member of the memorable Terminator series. T-X with her chilling performance as a killing machine gives us a glimpse into what our heroes will have to face in their apocalyptic future and emphasizes the obstacles humankind will have to overcome to survive.<br />Again, great movie, and I can't wait to see what kind of surprises this series will turn up with next.
B000002H2H|5.0|If you don't like this album then you're not really into metal. period. Every song from \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is a pure metal masterpiece! It deserves more than 5 stars.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Lara Croft Tomb Raider was an excellent movie, and don't think that I'm saying that because of how gorgeous Angelina Jolie is or because I'm some major action junkie. I say it not only because the transition from game to movie gave the game itself a more realistic depth, but also because Angelina Jolie displayed Lara Croft with a five-star attitude. Most action-based heroes are a) men and b) the same. In this movie though, a) the hero is actually a woman and b) she's different. Her expressions and her stylish display of intellect and physical capability give the movie its refreshing difference. Also, the character's British backgrounds, made believable by the talented Jolie, support the smooth cross between New World technology and Old World archaeology. So, all in all, Angelina Jolie's performance and the movie's simplistic, yet enjoyable plot make this movie a definite success, and the DVD's special features will only add to that success.<br />And to those people who didn't like it...<br />1. Your stamp of disapproval doesn't change how good the movie was.<br />2. Considering that you probably judged off of some twisted view of perfection, people probably shouldn't view your judgement as reliable.
B000002URV|1.0|Insipid, uninspired, uninspiring. <br />If you want creepy with Gregorian chants, the Swans crush this music as the heel of a giant crushes an ant. For massage music, I'll take my ethereal voicings, flutes and synth washes without any annoying euro-disco loop tracks, thank you very much.<br />There is no &quot;big deal&quot; about this record. Transcendent? I don't think so.
