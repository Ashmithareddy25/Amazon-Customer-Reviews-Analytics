B0019T9FL6|5.0|So ::: YES ::: -- I finally buckled down to buy this CD & I absolutely loved it! From the first SONG to the LAST! Besides, I read a few of the AMAZON reviews before buying & thought ... are some of y'all kidding me? One idiot even pointed out how the songs sounded TOO ALIKE. As in I'm assuming -- it's all R&B? No diversity? I'm not sure. But if you want to hear one thing I dislike about artists like BEYONCE --- is that she TRIES to hard to appeal to :::::::::::: ALL :::::::::::::: genres of music (eg. Popular, etc.). I love R&B. Those are the CDs I actually :::::::: buy :::::::::. That I pay my hard earned money for. Not other genres. I can watch those on \\"ON DEMAND\\" or listen to them on the radio or the 4 channels of music video's that I pay via a small fortune for Cable TV ... but I \\"buy\\" R&B CD's. To help support them. And to take this a step further -- I buy CDs like Mary J. Blige & Keyshia Cole because I know -- they will -- 100% -- stick to R&B & I don't have to worry about them adding OTHER retarded songs that try to appeal to other GENRES (eg. Brittany like, Christina like, Rihanna like, etc.) of music because what I seek is true R&B. That's it. And because of that -- that is ::: WHY ::: I will continue to buy Mary J. Blige, Keyshia Cole & now Jennifer Hudson! Not Beyonce. Not Rihanna. Not Brittany. So if you want TRUE R&B --- get Jennifer's CD. She will not fail you but if you have expectations that her CD is going to bow down to 'popular' music to appeal to ALL GENRES? Keep moving & don't buy it. Stick to Beyonce. It's all over the place & inconsistent.
1400082773|5.0|This biographical book reads like a novel that you don't want to end. This personal and candid glimpse into Obama's life is at once humorous, touching and revealing of his inquiring mind, thoughtful analyses and insight into how the environment and people around him shaped his thinking and his life.I thoroughly enjoyed the read and I know that I'll be reading the book again.
0446402389|5.0|This novel is so much more than a mystery.  The mystery actually plays second fiddle to the expose of the oppression of Stalinist Russia.    Leo, as he is now known, is a successful MGB agent, convicting \\"spies\\" everywhere on the basis of forced confessions, rumors and innuendo.  When he watches a co-worker brutally execute two innocents, he embarrasses him and the war is on for the other agent to discredit and ruin Leo.  He does so with a forced \\"confession\\" of man Leo realizes is innocent.  The confession includes Leo's wife as a spy.  Leo and his wife are convicted of anti-state activities and banished, not once, but a few times.  As the oppression wears on, Leo discovers a serial killer - an impossibility in the perfect state of the Soviet Union.  He and his wife make it their mission to find him and kill him, although this will likely lead to their execution.    No recitation of a plot will do service to this novel.  It captures so well the oppression of fascism and the personalities of those given unbridled power without reins of any kind.  Leo's awakening to the oppression and his relationship with his wife are worth reading the book alone.  As is the mystery.  As is the portrayal of fascism.  THis is a multi-level book well-worth reading.    As a sidenote, the CD is also terrific.
B00065MDS6|3.0|3 1/2    The progressive giant's 3rd LP kept things interesting in a heavier jazz context (call it free-rock), with a common theme of musical exploration beginning to solidify for these eternal searchers. Pound for pound, Lizard easily holds its own against their first two, heavier metalish discs, displaying even more counter-culture technical savvy, if at times over the expense of emotional involvement. But it is the meat-and-potatoes, second-side, orchestral final track which I feel robs the disc of masterful status; by no means dismissible, though not the epic I would have hoped for, with some overly experimental bloat creeping into much momentum.

B000002J2B|4.0|4 1/2    I'm with them wholeheartedly throughout Duke, but this just might be their last true masterpiece album. Almost any other band would probably make an album of this quality at their once-in-a-lifetime peak. Not Genesis. They were simply coming down from one of the greatest musical highs of the 70's, and all time, as far as I and modern progressive rock are concerned. The way they masterfully interwove their still highly ambitious songwriting around way more accessibility for a wider range of listeners without compromising any quality, besides for a slightly over-sapped \\"Your Own Special Way\\" which itself has a little growing potential, remains masterful to present day listening. While this version is probably the definitive one, I find the highly criticized '07 remasters to actually compliment W&W more than most of the other re-re-releases.
B00005JNS0|4.0|This is sort of like a pixar version of Doc Hollywood, it's the classic juxisposition of urban vs. rural and modern vs. vintage, with the requisite odd couple love triangle thrown in for good measure.  The digital animation is, of course first rate and the story has a nice message. I especially appreciated Newman's voice, his is the perfect voice for this character.  Look, I must confess, I cant stand Owen Wilson, his naisal voice and that bizarre nose, I mean what actress could have a career like he has had if she had a nose like that, I mean, right..but since I didnt not have to look at him, I actually liked his take on the main character, and Larry the Cable Guy is perfect as the old Redneck tow truck, as for the Porsche, I really didnt like Bonnie Hunt, her voice is too old, she is like well into her forties, they needed a Jennifer Anniston or Angie Jolie to voice that character, they are more Wilson's age, in all due respect, Hunt's voice was for like an 80's Accord, but whatever..cute movie, great vivid dig animation, kids will love it`

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have three younger siblings whom all share a similar interest in board games and video games. Whenever we're together during breaks from college or work, we like to play together...    Settlers is the best board game to play with your friends and siblings, and even if you lose, you can still make the winner player's struggle to victory the most aggravating 45 minutes of their life.     The game's idea is genuine and simple, but to master the victory points takes a lot of determination and strategy. The most important part is where you place your first few settlements, and then from there it becomes a breakneck race to 10 points.    My favorite part about this game is how it feels like a board game of Civilization or Age of Empires (PC video games for those unaware). Or maybe the game inspired those video games, but either way, this game is a classic, and definitely worth the money. Highly recommended you play with your closest friends and family, and don't be afraid to play cut-throat, because that's where the majority of the fun lies.

B00004XPPE|3.0|In 1965, a serious nuclear movie called \\"Fail Safe\\" was released. Henry Fonda is the President. A computer glitch launches The Bomb for the U.S.S.R. Fonda cannot recall it, and apologizes to the Soviet premier. His wife is visiting New York City, and in one of the worst political decisions in Hollywood history, Fonda tells the Soviets that in order to prove to them it was an accident, he will drop a 30-megaton nuclear bomb on the Big Apple! He carries through with his decision, despite his wife's presence there. The Soviets are portrayed as suffering their fate with dignified resolve.
0316017922|5.0|This book is hard to put down because it is so fascinating. Full of terrific insights, Gladwell gives detailed, specific examples to illustrate his points. I specialize in highly intelligent people - adults and children - and too many people are bitter over unfulfilled promise when they thought a good education alone - doing well in school - would guarantee their success. Gladwell, and another of my favorite authors, Dean Keith Simonton, reveals what else figures into anyone's \\"getting there.\\" This book is inspiring.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|In 1970, two films juxtaposed each other. \\"Patton\\" was an unlikely winner of eight Oscars. The pacifist Scott for all practical purposes took his Buck Turgidson character and refined him into the real-life Patton. In interviews, Scott said he found his research of Patton revealed an unbalanced man, but on screen Scott nailed him as the vainglorious, brilliant, driven warmonger he was. Steiger was offered the role first but turned it down because it glorified war. Vietnam was absolutely at its apex. It was very surprising that Hollywood would make such a film at that time. But director Frankin Schaffner had served under Patton, and after making \\"The Planet of the Apes\\" had the clout to call his shots. The film did not get America behind the war, but it did cause Nixon to start bombing Cambodia because the Patton story convinced him to get tough. The screenwriter, oddly enough, was Francis Ford Coppola, who may have done himself a turn. Coppola was no war lover, and wrote \\"Patton\\" as a man obsessed with war (\\"God help me, I love it so\\"), deluded by visions of Napoleonic grandeur mixed with Episcopalian Christianity and karmic reincarnation. The intent may have been to show a psychotic military man, to de-mask his heroism, and this may have been what prompted Scott to play it. From page to screen there are virtually no changes, but if Coppola was trying to put down the military by showing Patton's human warts, the result was a brilliant work that now is one of, if not the most, conservative pictures ever made. Watching \\"Patton\\" stirs wonderful pride in two countries (Great Britain is prominent in the film) that were tough enough to stand up to the Nazis when the rest of the world cowered in victimhood. Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is Patton's perfect foil, as is the Bernard Law Montgomery character. The film saved Coppola, who was about to be fired as \\"The Godfather\\" director. When he won the Oscar for \\"Patton\\", it gave him too much clout to get the axe.

Harry lives by a code: either everyone counts or nobody counts and he applies this code vehemently to solving this very personal case and soon discovers he may be ruffling some feathers among the high and mighty.<br /><br />He spots a lone coyote near his condemned house who seems bewildered, lost and confused and identifies strongly with the animal. He wonders if it is the last one to survive up in the hills above LA after the earthquake.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|The mid-1970s saw a spate of \\"government conspiracy\\" films, all with liberal themes that emanated from Watergate. None of them were about Kennedy stealing the 1960 election. Hmm.  \\"Chinatown\\" (1974) may be the best screenplay ever written. A historical look at 1930s Los Angeles, it actually condensed events from the 1900s with events that, uh, never happened but made for good drama. Written by L.A. native Robert Towne, directed by Roman Polanski, produced by Evans and starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunnaway and famed director John Huston, it told the story of how Los Angeles became a metropolis. In Towne's version, Huston \\"owns\\" the L.A. Department of Water & Power with a character based on actual L.A. City engineer William Mulholland. Mulholland had orchestrated the political deal which built the aqueduct that brought water from the Owens Valley into the L.A. Basin, allowing millions of Southern Californians to keep their lawns green to this day.  The Mulholland character is \\"sacrificed\\" at the altar of greed, embodied by Huston, who secretly buys the San Fernando Valley, knowing that once the water deal is set, it will be incorporated into the city, making him a gazillionaire. It is rather cynical, although nobody suggests the L.A. \\"city fathers\\" were boy scouts. The same old theme is that capitalism and American political power are corrupt. To make sure the audience is convinced the corruption is beyond redemption, Huston is in the end found out be an insatiable, incestual monster. He plays the role so well it brings up minds-eye imagery of his real daughter, Angelica. The film is utterly beyond any criticism, regardless of political colorization. For decades, film students and screenwriters have studied it. It spawned an artistic quest to lace the screen with symbols, metaphors, backstory, and twists.  \\"Chinatown\\" seems to be the apex of the American film period, the mid-1970s. The period from 1960 to 1979 is unparalleled, but the backstory of the people who created these classics is a telling tale of why the genre leans to the Left. In the 1960s, film schools became popular. Four schools emerged, and have held their place as the place to learn the craft. In Los Angeles there was the USC School of Cinema-Television. Their first big alumnus was \\"Star Wars\\" director George Lucas. UCLA combined their film school with their drama program, so as to bring actors, writers, directors and producers together. Coppola went to UCLA along with a future rock star named Jim Morrison, who would form The Doors with another UCLA film alumnus, keyboardist Ray Manzarek.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I'm one who's perpetually torn between Youth and Aha as the best of KOL, and still liked Because of the Times enough to wear out the CD, but i love this one too.  Yeah the production is definitely cleaned up and it's a more radio friendly output, but man these songs are still good. These guys are great songwriters, lyricists, and musicians. This album confirms that. They'll still be making records in 20 years. Evolve with em and you'll be a happy camper.    If the opener, \\"Closer\\" doesn't make you pay attention, then i'll never want to share a beer with you.     \\"Crawl\\" is something you'd not at all be suprised to hear coming from a U2 release. I did begin to wonder what direction this album was going. But hold fast. You'll be rewarded.     \\"Sex on Fire\\", ehhh. Don't quite understand why they'd use this one as their album opening single. Music is good enough. Caleb writes great lyrics as rule. Until. So \\"Sex on Fire\\"? Really? I just can't get past that.    \\"Use Somebody\\" is the anthem song (yeah they follow some stereotypical song progressions in this album). Also not as inventive as you've previously come to expect from the Sooners. But you'll still like it -can't help it. It's destined to finally catapult them into the mainstream.     \\"Manhattan\\" is a great departure from the previous songs in style and harmody. It's one you wouldn't be suprised to hear somewhere in Aha Shake Heartbreak. Mellow and hooky, this one leaves you feeling good.     \\"Reverlry\\" takes it down another notch. Think sitting on the couch, fire blazing, with a scotch, cubes sitting so long they're just slivers barely staying afloat. A strolling ballad about having a nice buzz on and rather than glummin about the great love you screwed up and lost, appreciating the great time you had with that one.     Second half of the album chimes in, literally. \\"17\\" will make you straighten up in your seat after the previous 2 tracks. It's also ShakeHeartbreakish.     Caleb takes over in \\"Notion\\", growling and showing off his ever improving pipes. This is new KOL.     What makes KOL great is that they don't sound like anybody and \\"I want you\\" is one of those originals that I just eat up. Doesn't rock, isn't a ballad, absolutely not for radio, but one of those glue songs you may consider your album favorite. Of course with lyric snuck in like, \\"A choke and a gag, she spit up and came back for more\\", how can one go wrong?    After awhile i started skipping \\"Be Somebody\\". Not that there's anything wrong with it. Nathan gets his opportunity to break sticks. Personally not a fan of the chorus.     But the truth is I was just anxious to get to \\"Cold Desert\\". It's a strange thing to want to be dropped into the depths of an ice cold depressing son of a bitch song, but \\"Cold Desert\\" is the one. Starts like a pair of murdered parents, plays out, and re-intros with another minute of the dark stuff, and i'm not talking about Guinness. Geez, what a beautiful, massacre of a song.    An audiophile gets desensitized to music and it takes a truly great band to make them smile. KOL has the rare ability to stir the highs and lows of the everyday condition in everyone, with a really unique perspective. They deliver it with a sound that is all their own. Can't beat these guys right now.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The Dark Knight is a great movie. As a comic book collecting geek I really look forward to these Superhero flicks. Batman Begins was a good movie - The Dark Knight is even better. The performance of the late Heath Ledger as the Joker is what puts this film over the top. A few problems keep this from being one of the top 3 comic book movies of all time: It is 30 minutes too long, the ending becomes too Hollywood treating Batman as a martyr, and the voice inflection that is produced over Christian Bales voice while he is in his Dark Knight personna is overbearing. It is still a must have for any comic book connoisseur.
B000RW3VD4|5.0|In 1987 OLIVER STONE again starred Charlie Sheen, this time as Bud Fox, along with Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas, in \\"Wall Street\\". Stone, like Coppola's \\"Patton\\", tapped into a part of America he really wanted to discredit, but instead glorified. Based on the go-go stock markets of the Reagan '80s, it is loosely based on inside arbitrageurs and junk bond kings like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Fox/Sheen is an idealistic, ambitious young stockbroker, his father is his conscience, and Douglas as Gordon Gekko is pure tantalizing temptation. Fox must violate SEC laws and get inside information in order to do business with the \\"big elephant\\" Gekko. Gekko's star fades when a big deal-gone-bad has personal ramifications, and Fox turns a dime on him. The film is supposed to show that America is a greedy place that \\"produces nothing\\" in a \\"zero sum game\\" in which the rich only make money on the backs of the poor. Gekko's (Stone's) statements about economics are pure, unadulterated economic lies shown to be lies simply by?observing factual things. Where Stone may have had second thoughts was the reaction the film got. As the years went by, he and others were approached countless times by Young Republicans and Wall Street execs who told him the depiction of the exciting world of finance led them into that very career, which they thanked him for! Stone had hoped to create an egalitarian class. Instead, he created a decade full of Gordon Gekkos. They in turn fueled the dot-com boom. It was not unlike the Democrats who hoped to expose Oliver North and the Republicans in the Iran-Contra \\"scandal,\\" only to discover that millions thought Ollie and his White House pals were doing God's work in fighting Communism.  Res ipsa loquiter.
B001DHXT20|4.0|This version of the Incredible Hulk is a good comic book movie. If you are a fan of Marvel comics you will enjoy this film. The action scenes treat as if they were lifted from a comic book ... as does all of the character tie-ins (Marvel is infamous for this little trick). I've collected comics for years and really look forward to these movies. The first Hulk directed by Ang Lee was a little disappointing ... but this one is a lot of fun! Put it in your collection you won't be disappointed.
B000BZISTE|5.0|At the same time, Robert Altman's \\"M*A\\"S*H\\" came out. It, too found an audience, and truth be told many who enjoyed \\"Patton\\" enjoyed \\"M*A*S*H\\". It was just plain funny, and the anti-military theme was subtle. Altman walked a brilliant tightrope between a pro-American and unpatriotic premise. There is no doubt that Altman intended it as an anti-Vietnam movie. It was written by former Communist Ring Lardner, Jr. Lardner had been Blacklisted, and this fact featured prominently in the politics of the film's aura. It was based on a sexy paperback novel about surgeons in Korea. The film was set in Korea, yet made every possible attempt to convey the image that it was actually Vietnam. Many of the movie's set pieces were deliberately Vietnamese in nature and costume, for that very purpose. To the extent that it was unpatriotic, it subtly described \\"regular Army\\" officers as unyielding, intolerant Christians, utterly blinded by stupid jingoism. The draftees, however, are funny and attractive as they drink and love their way through a bevy of good-looking nurses, all while saving lives in the style of comic Galahads. Altman showed genius as a filmmaker. The movie avoided real controversy because it was just so darn good.   \\"M*A*S*H\\" spurred a television show that ran for years. In the 1970s it played for its time and audience. Re-runs, however, strain its credibility beyond Altman's original themes. Two doctors played the \\"bad guy.\\" The first was a complete buffoon. Frank Burns was prominently identified as a Republican. He is given zero good qualities. He is ugly, a bad doctor, a coward, a racist and all-around mean SOB who cheats on his wife with Major Margaret Hoolihan, who at least is given some character. She is half-Vixen, half-Fascist, naturally Republican, a patriotic American in the \\"worst way,\\" who worships the idols of war. Over the years the writers gave Margaret a little development. Very little. Burns was replaced by Major Charles Emerson Winchester, a Boston Brahmin, naturally a Republican whose father \\"knows Truman. He doesn't like him, but he knows him.\\" Winchester, like Hoolihan, is allowed a touch of humanity when the liberal writers felt charitable, but generally was available for all possible bashing. Two hero-doctors anchor the show by showing their intelligence, medical skills and tolerance as direct contrasts to the war effort. The CIA is lampooned, and a military effort that in reality featured MacArthur's Inchon campaign, perhaps the most brilliant invasion in history, is also played as foolish. In the end, the TV show and the film avoid being really and actually unpatriotic because they do feature an emphasis on the basic goodness of the American spirit under stress, but you will not catch me tuned in to those old re-runs(...)
B000XTLVZG|5.0|Stacey's voice is beautiful, smooth and relaxing. This album is up for a Grammy and it should win.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This looked like the last movie I would ever get, not being particularly into farces and screwball comedy. But   if Vince Vaughn (\\"Swingers\\", \\"Made\\") is in it, then I probably will give it a look. \\"Old School\\" fulfilled Vaughn's comic promise, but it is ensemble and great.  It starts out with just the right touch when Luke Wilson returns home and finds sexy girlfriend Juliette Lewis expecting not him but her \\"Internet friends,\\" who are coming over \\"for the gangbang.\\" Makes you want to do a Google search for \\"single girls looking for group sex.\\"  This is an up-dated \\"Animal House\\", maybe better. Luke's post-Juliette recovery includes moving into a house next to the college, and when it looks like he cannot stay due to school regulations, they form a fraternity. Luke is a lawyer and his legal skills keep them above the dean's attempts to disband them as part of a childhood revenge.  Vince gives us great lines like, \\"What do you think, instead of spending time with my wife I'd rather hang out with 19-year old girls?\\"  USC grad Will Ferrell, who once tried out for the Trojans as a punter, may carry this film through sheer craziness. There is little message, just laughs. It has some mature themes, but despite Juliette's sexual wanderings is basically tame.  In the end, Juliette is still into swinging, when she invites Will to her next sexfest.
0316017922|5.0|What I like about this book is that it explains concepts in stories.  Some of the arguments and descriptions are surprising, and when you think about them you can see them acting out in your own life.  Other arguments are less persuasive - but even these arguments are a fine read and very entertaining.  All in all I found the book to be well balanced, well researched and well presented.  The book is made to feel like a personal conversation between you and the author rather than an instructional or lecturing guide.  You don't have to buy all the arguments, but you definitely should buy the book.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|In 1964 the first of the \\"bomb\\" movies came out. Kubrick further earned his place in the pantheon of film greats with his all-time classic \\"black comedy,\\" \\"Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Love the Bomb\\". Explaining how a movie that ends in the world obliterated by nuclear (actually hydrogen) holocaust is a comedy leads me to suggest watching it. Only then you will know. The iconoclastic Kubrick made an iconoclastic film starring the extraordinary Peter Sellers in three roles. He plays the President, a lily-livered liberal in the mold of Adlai Stevenson. He plays Mandrake, a British Royal Air Force officer, and he plays Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist based on Werner von Braun, although some of have suggested that they see in the madman Henry Kissinger. Kissinger was not well known when the script by Terry Southern (who later wrote \\"Easy Rider\\" but died destitute) was turned in.  The premise is that an Air Force General, Jack Ripper (most of the characters are given descriptive names), played by the Communist bohemian and Sausalito weed smoker Sterling Hayden, goes mad. He is convinced that because water is fluoridated the Communists have conspired to deprive red-blooded Americans of their \\"essence,\\" their \\"vital bodily fluids\\"...their semen. For this obviously stupid (believed only by right wing wackos) reason, Ripper overrides Air Force protocol and orders his nuclear attack wing to bomb Russia back to the stone age. Of course this is meant to show that the military is filled with lunatic fringe elements with their hands on the button. In an interesting bit of terminology, the words Soviet Union are never uttered, only Russia, presumably to \\"humanize\\" all those agrarian reformers. Thought I hadn't caught that, huh? Anyway, real-life pacifist George C. Scott, playing General Buck Turgidson, discovers Ripper's plan. He is another Curt LeMay take-off, bombastic and filled to the brim with sexual testosterone that seemingly can only be released by his bikini-clad girl Friday, or by bombing the Russkies to smithereens.  A plan is hatched to inform the Communists how to shoot down the wing, in order to prevent nuclear holocaust. Turgidson thinks that is a terrible idea and that as long as the boys are on their way, they should drop their payload on the bastards. The Russian Ambassador, however, puts a crimp in those plans by informing the President that this would set off a Doomsday Machine, guaranteed to destroy all life on Earth. Turgidson laments the fact that there is a \\"gap\\" between the Soviet possession of such a device, which the Americans lack, no doubt due to liberal malfeasance. Forced by the Doomsday scenario to avoid holocaust, the Americans and Russians work together to shoot down all the U.S. planes, save one. Meanwhile, Ripper kills himself and his aide de camp, Mandrake/Sellers, discovers the recall code. But the last plane, piloted by good ol' boy Slim Pickens, is as Turgidson/Scott describes, wily enough to evade radar, while damage from a heat-seeking missile has rendered it unable to receive the recall. They make their run. Pickens makes his cowboy speech about going \\"toe to toe, nuclear combat with the Russkies\\" and emphasizes the crew, including a young James Earl Jones, is due commendations \\"regardless of race, color or creed.\\" With Pickens personally releasing and riding his bomb into a Valhallic destiny, the deed is done, leaving the Doomsday shroud to envelop the Earth. All is not lost, however, because Dr. Strangelove/Sellers, messianically saluting the President as \\"mein Fuhrer,\\" describes how mineshafts can be converted into underground government societies for the next 100 years. The boys all smile when Strangelove says that in order to further the human race through procreation, many more attractive women than men would have to be recruited to do \\"prodigious sexual work.\\" Unfortunately, monogamy would have to be a thing of the past. The end.  \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" may be one of the 10 greatestmovie ever made, but its comic message was clear: The military is not to be trusted, nuclear weapons serve no good purpose, and the Soviets are likely to be victims of our aggression. Like a number of movies, however, its political message is stilted. Reagan said it was his favorite(...)
B001LF4IA6|3.0|I'm not going to sugar coat this review by saying things like, \\"not my favorite, but still worthy addition\\" or \\"he's optimistic this time, so I give him credit\\". No, I will boldly state that this is a weak entry into Springsteen's repertoire. Not his worst, though.<br /><br />My problem with \\"Working On A Dream\\" is the lack of memorable lyrics or melodies. I've listened to this disc multiple times and very little sticks. It is rather boring. I get Springsteen attempting different things with each album, but his track record is wildly uneven.<br /><br />Beginning with the 8 minute opus \\"Outlaw Pete\\", an overly indulgent track if there ever was one, and thematically it doesn't belong here. \\"My Lucky Day\\" is probably the best track here besides \\"The Wrestler\\" (which is also out of place on this disc). \\"Working on a Dream\\", \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\"(terrible title), \\"This Life\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Life Itself\\", \\"The Last Carnival\\" are all fair. \\"What Love Can Do\\", \\"Good Eye\\", \\"Kingdom of Days\\" and \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" are all weak.<br /><br />So here it is, my comparison chart for \\"Working on a Dream\\":<br /><br />1973 Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.: Three Stars<br />1973 The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle: Three and a Half Stars<br />1975 Born To Run: Four Stars<br />1978 Darkness on the Edge of Town: Four Stars<br />1980 The River: Four and a Half Stars<br />1982 Nebraska: Five Stars<br />1984 Born in the U.S.A.: Five Stars<br />1987 Tunnel of Love: Four Stars<br />1992 Human Touch: Two and a Half Stars<br />1992 Lucky Town: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 The Ghost of Tom Joad: Three Stars<br />2002 The Rising: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Devils & Dust: Three Stars<br />2006 We Shall Overcome: Four Stars<br />2007 Magic: Four Stars<br />2009 Working on a Dream: Three Stars
B00006CXSS|5.0|On the heels of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks co-produced this no-holds-barred HBO TV show that follows a single World War II airborne unit, Easy Company (Company E) from training to D-Day to Operation Market Garden to the Bulge to the kicking-in of the heartbreaking German concentration camps, and finally to the melancholy end of the war and, inevitably, the breaking-up of the unit as they take their first tentative steps towards becoming regular American citizens again.  The show does not hold back from showing death and destruction. Characters we are just beginning to care about suddenly die. This recreates the terrible cost of friendship among the soldiers themselves.     Some characters are incredibly brave. Others are cowards or incompetents. The key is to avoid cartoon depictions, and demonstrate the humanity of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances. Along the way, they take to the challenges placed before them and accomplish the greatest victory in history. One is left with the inevitable truth that they have done the greatest thing in 2000 years of modern history, and a world has been saved by their deeds.
B0018CVQFM|3.0|When making a retrospective box set it is always difficult to satisfy everybody. I'll sum up what I liked and what I disliked:    - very nice packaging, similar to the David Crosby Voyage retrospective. Each songs has a short story to it, detailed credits and a picture. Nice format as well (CD case size book)  - the set contains a large number of alternative mixes, but they don't add something extra to the song  - some (imo) great songs really missing, like Out On The Island, Wounded Bird, And So It Goes, I Miss You, Blacknotes, and Frozen Smiles.  - disappointing sound quality. I greatly enjoyed the recently released  DVD-Audio version of 'Songs For Beginners'. 'Reflections' makes no chance in terms of audio quality.  - The Hollies songs are all in mono (taken from mono singles releases). To me they don't sound better than the stereo mixes. Besides if one prefer he can always convert stereo mixes to mono but not vice versa.    Musically this box set shows us that Nash has written just too many weak (as well as overproduced) songs on this retrospective.    But to be honest: that can be forgiven. He did write some really great songs (and even had the biggest hit of CSNY)! And he's always been very serious about music and life...
B00008N6N5|3.0|When Ronald Reagan became the President, a shift to conservatism occurred in Hollywood and the media. Hustler founder Larry Flynt flirted with Christianity, but it did not take. When his editors suggested that the Reagan mood should portend more \\"family friendly\\" fare, Flynt fired that messenger and went from sick and disgusting to really hardcore porn (which is better than sick and disgusting). He aligned himself against the Republicans, who were asking 7-11s to keep their porn mags away from minors (a move since described by liberals as tantamount to Stalinist censorship). In 1998, Flynt became the mouthpiece of the Democrat party, a de facto Clinton spokesman and unofficial public relations firm for the DNC. In 2003 he decided to run for Governor of California as a Democrat. While his intentions may be to benefit the Democrats, he could not have harmed them more. Republicans need say nothing about this fact. It exists for what it is, on it face. Republicans just smile and say, \\"Hey, you Democrats, you can have Larry Flynt.\\" They have him and he has them. A mariage made in...?

B00005JKED|5.0|Back in the \\"go go\\" 1980s, during the heady era of Wall Street \\"greed,\\" I read an article about a black stock broker indicted by the SEC for insider trading. It struck me that, in an odd way, this was indicative of progress for African-Americans. They had to have access to the inside in order to be indicted for it. In the old days, they never would have had those doors opened in the first place.  Which brings me to \\"Training Day\\", in which Denzel Washington delivers an astonishingly good performance as a totally corrupt and evil L.A. cop. The fact that an African-American leading man is portrayed as the \\"bad guy\\" is truly groundbreaking, and just another reason to look at this film and be in awe of it. In the same strange twist as the stock broker, here we see a black cop who has all the doors of sin open to him. Like the white cops of the Jim Crow South, he takes to corruption in a way that has no skin color. It is the story of humanity, temptation and power.   Blacks on film have for a number of years now been shown either one way or the other. There is no shortage of depictions of black drug dealers, gangbangers and \\"homies.\\" Hollywood then tries to make up for it by portraying blacks as doctors, lawyers, voices of conscience or reason, and the most frequent stereotype, the \\"tough but fair police commander.\\"  The negative portrayals of blacks, however, were never played by big name actors. Washington himself has built a career as a guy more or less saving the world in \\"Crimson Tide\\" and \\"Fallen\\". His flaws in \\"Ricochet\\" are brought out only by a vindictive white man (John Lithgow). In \\"Training Day\\", Denzel is all on his charismatic own, a product of a world that he is convinced revolves around him. By choosing to pursue this amazing role, Denzel demonstrates the kind of courage that is rare among actors.  Think of Robert Redford, for instance. Redford never let his hair down. He played heroes and fantasy figures. Every so often, however, a superstar will break type. Paul Newman did it in \\"Hud\\". So did Robert Duvall in \\"The Great Santini\\".  What is even more astonishing in \\"Training Day\\" is not just that a black guy is the bad guy, but a white guy (Ethan Hawke) is a clearly marked, unfettered hero, placed in utter contrast and opposition to the villain. \\"Candy Man\\", a B movie franchise of the early 1990s, featured the politically explosive portrayal of a black man slicing and dicing his way through white women, but this was hardly big time fare.  \\"Training Day\\" takes all the Political Correctness of the past 20 years and explodes it. Hawke not only is innocent and good in contrast with Denzel, but he is a Lancelot-type figure who comes to the aid of a Latino-girl-in-distress, and later faces torture and terror at the hands of a group of Mexican gangbangers. The actors who portray these guys are so good, so real and so terrifying that if you met them on the streets, even knowing they were just acting, you would be a little frightened.  By no means does \\"Training Day\\" leave the viewer groping with the uncomfortable notion that \\"white is right.\\" The performances are too real and too powerful. It is only in retrospect that one realizes this is truly groundbreaking stuff. Denzel Washington is extraordinary. His performance in this film is among the very best ever seen. There are not enough superlatives, not enough words, than can do justice to his edgy power.  \\"Training Day\\" leaves the thinking viewer utterly exhausted and left in some kind of daze, grateful only that they do not live in the netherworld shown herein. Look at Ethan's face when he rides the bus after escaping, through pure luck and coincidence, death at the hands of the gangbangers. He is beaten. His actions afterwards are about redemption, a decision to take his life in a new direction in which expediency and innocence are no longer options. He has been transformed into a reluctant avenging angel, forced to face evil and fear because he cannot turn back. It is the story of Original Sin. Ethan represents what the viewer does not have the gumption to be at this point. The viewer wants only to crawl in a hole and forget what (s)he has seen, but Ethan's character is about the confrontation of good vs. evil that must take place if humanity hopes to advance.
B001ILFUD2|3.0|It's difficult to define an era of Disney as lesser or greater than another. The 1980's are thought of as a lesser era, yet they produced The Fox and the Hound, The Great Mouse Detective, and The Little Mermaid, three classics of the Disney canon. That three out of six movies released by the studio in ten years weren't classics doesn't show how low Disney had gone as much as it proves how high their standards had been previously.    Oliver and Company is a cute movie, but it is also thoroughly mediocre. Young kids will love it, as young children like every animated movie. But, unlike most Disney movies, Oliver and Company doesn't hold up for adults. I watched it for the first time in ten years last night, and my attention wandered away on several occasions. The characters aren't as well-developed, their interactions aren't as enjoyable, as in other Disney films. What this feels like is a Disney movie going through the motions, which is the way you can tell the bad ones from the classics.
6305511055|5.0|Robert Redford made a clunker called \\"The Way We Were\\" with Barbra Streisand that desperately tried to explain, apologize for, justify, glorify and approve of being an American Communist during McCarthyism, but just plain fails. He made the 1973 classic \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" (1973), with Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunnaway. He plays a CIA reader, a kind of pre-Tom Clancy research guy, a benign fellow among other benign CIA fellows, all of whom are murdered in a fuzzily explained hit by bad CIA fellows. After escaping, Redford tries to get to the bottom of it. Since he is a genius he has the intellectual tools to outwit his chasers. This is the film's highlight, revolving around the sexual tension between Redford and the redoubtable Faye, who he \\"kidnaps\\" in order to have a place to hide out, her apartment. The movie goes off the deep when the whole conspiracy turns out to be about the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, where the U.S. apparently is planning the invasion (that never actually occurred) to take over OPEC. The message is that The Company murders innocents, the U.S. is a warmongering empire, and tool of capitalist greed. It is Redford's answer to Guatemala, Iran and Chile, where the people killed were generally Communists. Redford would rather show the CIA killing Chinese- and African-Americans and other non-threats.

0684803356|5.0|EXCERPTED FROM \\"GOD'S COUNTRY\\" BY STEVEN TRAVERS    \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti-Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war, which some say was a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for World War II. It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for. The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s. While the nation is now Democratic, the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity. Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called \\"The Fifth Column\\".

B000NTPDSW|5.0|\\"The Godfather\\" (1972) was a stylized masterpiece. Its auteur director, Coppola, laced it with the subtlest Leftist message that may have avoided the radar of even longtime fans who have seen the film 10 or more times. When interviewed by producer Robert Evans, Coppola said he wanted to make a movie that was a metaphor for capitalism in America. Evans told him what he could do with his metaphors, but Coppola was brilliant and an authentic Italian, a Hollywood rarity at that time. His ethnicity was considered necessary in the making of a Sicilian mob picture.  In the classic Tahoe scene of \\"Godfather II\\", Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tells a Nevada Senator that he is just as corrupt as he is. In the first film Pacino tells Diane Keaton (Kay) that his father is no different than the President, in that they are both powerful men who have other men killed. The \\"family\\" is depicted as a corporate empire that must change with the times like a car company, only the stock in trade of the mob was the transition from prohibition booze to heroin (although Michael's goal is eventual \\"legitimacy\\"). What gives Coppola's work authentic panache, as opposed to so many heavy-handed liberal messages, is that in \\"The Godfather(s)\\", his messages have the ring of truth.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I watched the North and South for my history class. My teacher assigned this as an extra credit and since I wasn't doing so well in the class, I decided to give it a try. Ofcourse I thought at first it wouldn't be a good film and would just be boring. I was wrong.....Since many reviews talk about the story, I wiill not do so but the story is amazing. I laughed, I cied, and I was shocked watching it. Despite that, the scene of the industrial revolution was very real. Based on a novel of the same name written in 1855, 5 years after the peak of the industrial revolution, the settings are almost identical to our history text book. It's basically learning history while enjoying it. Beutiful story (probably the third time I said it) but most importantly, a very good history lesson.
B0016K40KY|5.0|This is David Lean's greatest film, a masterpiece of historical cinema that includes breathtaking photography and acting performances for the ages. Lean seems to have wanted to tell us, in 1962, where the world was and why it was there. This was the middle of the Cold War, Israel was beginning to become a major international issue, and oil in the Middle East was an overriding concern. Still, \\"Lawrence\\" does not make the attempt to educate through a lot of exposition, dialogue or otherwise. There is little reference to the fact that this all occurs duing World War I, or what was known at the time as The Great War.  Lean assumes the audience, then (and now) knows the history, but it is worth putting it in perspective. World War I broke out in 1914 on two fronts, with the Germans invading France through Belgium and fighting the British and French, while establishing a Russian Front against the Tsar. The Middle East is almost totally controlled by Turkey, which for centuries has dominated through its Ottoman Empire. They are a secular empire, although Islamic by far. The Ottoman has a loose affiliation with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which controls Germanic states and the Balkans, and through natural identity is allied with Germany.  Turkey hitches its wagon to Germany and becomes the third wheel of the Central Powers. They believe Germany will win and Democracy will not. Oil is just beginning to become a huge political issue in the region as the car and the airplane are now commonplace. Turkey sees a chance to create hegemony with a Germanic Empire by consolidating power through the steppes, the backdoor from Turkey (the old Byzantine Empire) into Eastern Europe and Russia. A squeeze play, if you will. This is the third front.  Winston Churchill is in charge of the British Navy and sees the Turkish intent. He decides to counteract it early via an amphibious invasion at Gallipoli in the Dardanelles. It is a disaster of total proportion, and explains why Winston was onthe outs until he was made a last ditch hope against Hitler 25 years later. Turkey expands through the Armenia and a genocide occurs of Holocaust proportions.  England establishes a military presence in the Arab lands, but their only hope is to create reargaurd action against Turkey. In this inhospitable place, in an age of poor communications, the only way to gain ground is to coalese with the local Arabs who hate the Turks.   Enter T.E. Lawrence, bastard son of an English nobleman, Oxford educated, fluent in Arabic with a natural love and affiliation with these people. He is also an engineer and knows how to blow up bridges and rairoads, the best way to disrupt the Turks.  Lawrence is sent on a wild goose chase into the desert to liaison with King Feisal in what is now Iraq. He organizes tribes into fighting units and does great damage to the Turks, forcing them to deal with this rear action. In a move that rivals MacArthur's Inchon campaign, he leads his tribal army across the Nefu Desert to the port of Aquaba, bluffing the Arabs into believing \\"there is gold in Aquaba.\\" The Turks have 12-inch guns pointed at the sea, curtailing Naval hopes, and are completely surprised by an infantry attack from the forbidding desert. Aquaba is taken, which now allows the Brits to push on Jerusalemn, just down the coast.  This all has two major effects. It is the beginning of the end for Turkey as they begin to lose the war, but it also coalesces the Arabs from tribes to a single political peoples. Lawrence is a publicity-hound and given huge credit for all of it, but subsequent study shows much is P.R. Still, he has genuine love for Arabs. Stories of his derring-do are part of America's entrance into the fight.  Eventually, the war is won and now Britain controls the Middle East. They desire to hand control to the Arabs, but the Arabs simply are not organized or modern enough to handle this new world. The Brits must stay, which of course causes great local consternation. Whatbungles it more is the Sykes-Picot Treaty, which gives France, who did not fight in the region, much control of the region in a \\"victor go the spoils\\" move. They get Lebanon, Syria, are in Algeria, Morocco, and history tells us they screwed up the region so much that they are deserving of the lion's share of blame for what has happened there since.  England stayed for decades but eventually de-colonization before and after WWII gave countries back, often to monarchies. France with their Foreign Legion stays and creates enemies. Revolutions ocurred and the monarchies were upended in favor of despots in league with Communists, and after the Cold War they morphed into Islamic Fascism.  Lean seems to want to create the \\"impression\\" that British political decisions were not favorable to the Arabs, but he does show that the locals were not prepared to handle this responsibility. In truth, Lawrence was sent to Versailles to prepresent the Arabs and walked out in disgust. Oil and land were simply to important to leave to the tribes. The influx of Jews to Palestine in the 1920s and '30s further added to the cauldron.  This film is a very instructive historical piece. It could not be made today, as theatres would sell tickets to part one and part two separately for the four-hour extravaganza. Also, I believe I count only two women in the entire film, a couple of extras at a tribal feast. Today's film execs would scream for a love story and sex.  Peter O'Toole demonstrates a fey Lawrence, leaving the question of homosexuality. He has two fawning assistants, Arab boys who are devoted to him. Who knows? Lawrence's actual sexual identity has never been solved, but it is entirely possibly he was gay.  One thing for sure, he was brilliant and charismatic.
0312944098|5.0|This was a great story.  Loved it!  It was a modern day take-off of the Count of Monte Cristo, which is one of my favorite books. I finished it last night around 4:00.  It was hard to put down.
B00005NB8K|5.0|This is the best rock movie ever made. Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time. This is a film he gets less credit for, but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done. First of all, he nails the life of Jim Morrison, the story of The Doors, and the L.A. Scene (1960s) as perfectly as it can be done. It is beyond nostalgoia, it is time travel.  As great as Stone's use of Doors songs, scenery, drug use and beautiful, heavily-decorated '60s California girls is, it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest. Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks.  Next on the agenda, you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on, irritating Ray Manzarek. To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors, everything is flawless. The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene, particularly Morrison urinating at Barney's Beanery, which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe.  The feeling watching \\"The Doors\\" switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led, and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it.  Love my girl!

B0000CDL93|5.0|What really has set the Left back is not just the failure of this film medium to accomplish their goals, but also the lack of faith accorded college professors, school textbooks, and mainstream news. So who is left to tell the real story?  Weeeeeell, my friends, we are out there. We have been waiting in the wings all these years, gathering the facts in silence, not showing our hand, waiting for judgment day. The day of reckoning is upon us. Let freedom reign.  As for \\"JFK\\", it is a complicated piece of fiction that would require some real research to effectively discredit all of its lies. What it did in the theatre was have one asking, \\"Jeez, did that really happen?\\" or \\"My God, is this true?\\" or \\"Holy cow, I can't believe this could be.\\" It is major sensory overload. Innocent civilians who knew things are killed. Deception and murder are used to cover up the sordid deeds. The film requires several viewings, and frankly time, probably years, to unravel it. What happens is that various reviews, reports from historical figures and historians are read and pieced together. After a while the discovery is made that a particular \\"witness\\" never existed, a certain \\"police officer\\" is a figment of Stone's imagination, smoke in the trees, conversations, special ops guys with the inside scoop (particular \\"Major X\\" played by Canadian Donald Sutherland) are invented out of whole cloth. A proposition is one thing, but \\"JFK\\" is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", a \\"riddle wrapped inside an enigma, tied by a puzzle\\" or whatever it is Joe Pesci says. It is exhausting.   So who killed JFK? Oh, maaaaan! Stone's answer, as best I can tell, was Lyndon Johnson, in league with the joint chiefs, because Kennedy wanted out of Vietnam and they wanted in (because American industry needed the war?), working with right wing Birchers, who were part of rogue elements of the CIA (?), who were a \\"track,\\" whatever that is, that could not be stopped because it was an inexorable connection starting in Guatemala (\\"good\\"), Iran (\\"good\\"), and Bay of Pigs (\\"not so good\\"), that had become dominated by Cuban exile \\"Republicans,\\" working in league with the Soviets (KGB?), who recruited Lee Harvey Oswald, who learned to shoot in the Marines, who lived and married in Russia then came back, who promoted Marxism but was funded by Birchers (?), who was a patsy for the Dallas Mafia, who had Oswald-lookalikes say incriminating things, who worked with JFK, who worked with La Casa Nostra (who turned on him?), who were tied to Naval Intelligence (?), who operated out of a corner in New Orleans in which the Feds, the NIS and somebody else all had offices, who were tied to right wing homosexual businessmen, defrocked priests, gay prostitutes and guys with tempers like Ed Asner, whose activities were known by corrupt New Orleans lawyers and politicians, who were in league with the New Orleans International Trade Mart or something like that, protected by Dallas strip club owners, who hatched a plan that involved Cubans training in the Florida swamps or Latin America by gay militia commandos, who bought a bad Italian rifle with a bolt action release via mail instead of purchasing a better weapon through the black market or a store, who gave it to Oswald, who may or may not have fired at JFK but could not possibly have hit his mark from the Texas Book Depository, who with Secret Service agents working to kill the President had assassins disguised as police officers and bums in the bushes, a car wreck lot and a grassy knoll, and created a triangulated cross-fire that killed the President then got away.  Now, friends and neighbors, after all of that, at no time does Mr. Stone suggest that the assassination was the work of a fellow he later visited and said was a great man, named Fidel Castro, who is the most likely suspect.   Res ipsa loquiter.  Castro and the mob? Maybe. The confusion of Stone's plot twists is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect that with which the real killers want. Stone's film vastly hurts the attempt to learn the truth. He raises plenty of legitimate questions, mainly regarding the so-called \\"magic bullet,\\" and he operates on at least one fairly solid foundation, which is that the Zapruder film seems to show more than one shooter. Saying Oswald was not a lone gunman is a premise I can give credence to, but beyond that God knows.  One thing is puzzling, and that is that in all the years since nobody has \\"stepped forward.\\" Every so often somebody shows up on Larry King Live and says his father, usually a \\"Dallas cop,\\" was the shooter, but these stories always have the crackpot feel to them. I want a deathbed confession from a Cuban, one of Sam Giancana's guys, something solid. When all the smoke clears, you still have a Communist sympathizer, Oswald, killing a President who just humiliated Kruschev over the Bay of Pigs, is a threat to Castro and is building up troops to fight Commies in Vietnam. It is plausible he had help and they were on the Grassy Knoll, they got away and Jack Ruby killed Oswald to shut him up. Maybe a little too convenient. The Warren Commission report came out only one year later, not enough time to sort out everything. The Church hearings were too open to get the real stuff beyond salacious sex. Secret CIA/FBI investigations might have been the only real answer, and who knows, maybe they were conducted, and maybe the gullible public cannot handle the truth. Who knows? Not Oliver Stone.

B000A2UBN4|5.0|In \\"Cape Fear\\", Marty Scorsese introduces a Fourth of July parade scene rife with sluggish Americana. The scene is slowed down, given morbid music, and depicts patriotic icons with bland expressions, going through the motions while an unenthusiastic crowd masks a black-and-white cancer. It also chooses to make Bob DeNiro a really dangerous Christian who quotes Scripture, speaks in tongues and preaches while he commits his acts of violence. Outside of one episode of \\"The X Files\\" in which a sect of Hasidic Jews included some ghost-Jew character who kills in the name of same ancient Hebrew tenet, I cannot recall seeing openly Jewish killers on screen.

B000R8YC18|5.0|In 1976, Martin Scorsese directed \\"Taxi Driver\\", starring Robert DeNiro. Calling this a \\"conservative\\" movie is a stretch, but it is a prescient look at New York attitudes that preceded the age of Giuliani. Paul Schrader wrote it. His story is a hoot in and of itself. He and his brother were raised in a strict Calvinist Pennsylvania family, emphasizing the strictest tenets of Scripture and absolutism. The Calvinists are big on pre-ordained destiny. Released from this environment, he came to Hollywood and tried everything. Naturally, he was a mess; a drug addict, an alcoholic and a heterosexual so confused he tried homosexuality just?to try it. Given the assignment to write a screenplay, he was holed up in a downtown L.A. hotel for weeks, then months. He had little social contact except occasional taxi rides to restaurants in and around L.A.'s skid row. He began to see the world from inside the taxi, and came up with a character and a plot revolving around the concept.  DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam Marine vet, off kilter but moral, who is sickened by the crime, drugs and immorality of 1970s New York City, seen from the taxi he drives night and day. He has an ill-fated fling with a pretty campaign worker (Cybil Shephard), goes off the deep end and portrays himself as a possible assassination threat to a Presidential candidate, although this is never fleshed out. In the end, he commits an act of vigilantism to save the life of a teenage prostitute with potential (Jodie Foster), and like in \\"Death Wish\\" (Charles Bronson), is made a hero.  The message of \\"Taxi Driver\\" is that peace comes from strength. It was a popular theme in a number of flicks. Hollywood seemed to fail to grasp some important realities about its marketplace. Time after time, movies that veered away from \\"touchy feely\\" liberalism and gave teeth to conservative characters (Eastwood's \\"Dirty Harry\\", Bronson, DeNiro, and others) made boffo box office, yet the industry has never come to grips with itself. They return time after time to premises that insult conservative audiences, and wonder why the lines get shorter.
B001P22HK8|5.0|Without a doubt a thrilling read.  This piece of fiction is close to where our reality may be truly headed.  Just pause for a moment to consider the evolution of technology in the last 10 years and it is easy to consider that Suarez may have just predicted our future.

B001C3KCSY|3.0|I remember a time when KOL were mentioned as the next great rock band. False alarm friends: This is not the second coming of The Stones, Stone Roses or even The Strokes. Only by the night is an enjoyable, safe little rock and roll record. The bros (and one cuz) are adept at slick, generic radio friendly music. Caleb's vocals range from competent to fair and then back to middling again(he seems like he's going thru the motions). I'd compare them more to Tom Petty or Coldplay than to true trailblazing artists (Zep, Clash, Nirvana, Arcade Fire etc.) That's ok, KOL fans: Have a good time with these paupers of rock; Just don't tell us that their music is on fire. P.S. Cold Desert is the one great song on this disc...
0307269752|3.0|Stieg Larsson was a political activists and journalist that represented left wing causes in Sweden. I read his biography on wikipedia and browsed the reviews here at Amazon. That made me have good expectations about this book. I thought that I would read a cleaver novel written by a Scandinavian author that would be different from the usual.<br /><br />The book is a family whodunit. It doesn't take long for us to be introduced to the Vanger family and it is quite important to know this family well. That's my first criticism. The family has several members and most of them almost don't show up in the book at all (they are either dead and the alive ones are shallowly covered). We know them by the narration of about three family members and all of the sudden I didn't know who was who.<br /><br />In the second act, I realized that there is nothing special with this book. Actually, it reminded me Michael Crichton. The author spent a lot of time trying to convince us that the story is plausible and that turned me off . All the technology details were also naive. We needed to know what brand of computers the characters use, their software, how do they use their computers, hacking and so on. As if the author needed to convince himself that the story could be possible.<br /><br />The third act was at least 1/4 of the book and everything dragged for too long, especially because the resolution happened relatively early and the story was flat after that.<br /><br />I give 3 stars because it was still readable. But this book doesn't even come close to be the masterpiece that others claim.
0312944098|5.0|I've read a lot of Jeffrey Archer books and having just finished A Prisoner of Birth, I think it's his best. There is a fascinating main plot along with many secondary ones to keep you guessing and surprised to the final page. Archer has to be among the very best fiction writers. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed. Be parepared to lose sleep because once you've started it, you won't be able to put it down.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire is a rags to riches saga, and it's also the oldest story in the world: Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy tries to get girl back...  But yet, in so many ways, it takes what could be such a dusty old story and makes it new again. Even the premise of a game show on first blush seems like it will yield little if anything of interest, but even though I am not a fan of these silly game shows (except of course Jeopardy, which challenges the mind) I was enthralled by this movie.<br /><br />And on top of the compelling story, you also get a most fascinating backdrop: India, and the City of Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay. You get teeming slums filled with poor but resourceful people juxtaposed with the splendor of the Taj Mahal; you get an ancient culture making rapid fire changes to a modern one, transforming before your eyes. Slumdog Millionaire is quite an achievement, and one that seems to have come along at precisely the best time: Like the game show, it offers an escape in times of economic strife.<br /><br />The device of the game show is brilliant, as it allows the questions, and the subsequent interrogations, to each trigger a flashback, an episode in the past that will illuminate how Jamal Malik, the nominative Slumdog Millionaire, came to know the answer. Sure, there is some luck involved, but oftentimes a memorable event in Jamal's past will make the answers stick in his mind. As we discover how he knew the answers we also learn about how much he loves Latika, and how his brother Salim became a gangster. The performances of the three characters in that \\"bazaar\\" love triangle, as children, and then young adults, were brilliant. Kudos to Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, and the lovely Freida Pinto. Anil Kapoor was brilliant as the show host, Prem Kumar--a younger, Indian version of Regis, but with an edge.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Prem Kumar: So are you ready for the final question for 20 million rupees?<br />Jamal Malik: No, but maybe it's written, no?<br />Prem Kumar: Maybe...<br />=============================<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000AOKTI4 The Darkest Light [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Great Britain ]]] (1999) (Simon Beaufoy, writer & director)<br />[[ASIN:6305622914 The Full Monty]] (1997) (written by Simon Beaufoy)<br />[[ASIN:1439136653 Slumdog Millionaire: A Novel]] Vikas Swarup<br /><br />DIRECTED BY DANNY BOYLE<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000Y7U98C Sunshine]] (2007)<br />[[ASIN:B000AP04GK Millions]] (2004)<br />[[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]] (2002)<br />[[ASIN:B00003CWM3 The Beach]] (2000)<br />[[ASIN:6305499144 A Life Less Ordinary]] (1997)<br />[[ASIN:6304806442 Trainspotting]] (1996)<br />[[ASIN:079284405X Shallow Grave]] (1995)<br /><br />--------------<br />Middle Salim: Shut up!

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I saw this movie roughly 2 months ago and I still think about it. The sexualized atmosphere of sucking, feasting, consumption and pursuit/hunting  in this movie are held respectfully in the camera's gaze, and it's out of admiration that I found these actions sexy and moving. Here is a vampire, now find him/her sexy never happens in this movie. But you are held in sheer awe of the power-curse each survives through that the sexiness peeks through -- like day-glo glitter on clothing worn by ravers the night before.     Self-sacrifice, usually cast as seduction rather than sacrifice, the victim normally gives him/herself over to the predator after they succumb to \\"wiles,\\" and so this sacrificial selflessness seems to me rarely treated in previous vampire movies and one of the many aspects at work to dismantle the historic cliche.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks that I have ever bought.  I actually love every song on it.  Also, Rob Pattinson has an amazing voice!  I am just as swept off my feet by the cd as I am with all of the books!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I want to say that the follow comment is in spanish (my native language) because it is very difficult to me to describe the amazing show in an appropiate way.    Lo que mas me cautivo de este espectaculo fue ver la forma en que disfruta cada participante de lo que hace y como se comunica con cada miembro del equipo. Basta ver los gestos... las sonsrias... las miradas y uno puede comprender que estan disfrutando a pleno de su trabajo, y es increible como esa energia la logran transmitir a los que los miramos.  La mezcla de naciones (por lo tanto tambien de creencias y formas diferentes de ser) que conforman al equipo de trabajo es una forma tambien de demostrar que la musica trasciende fronteras y es una forma de unir a las personas.    Mas que un espectaculo de musica este show es una verdadera muestra de lo bien que salen las cosas cuando se pone verdadera pasion a lo que se hace.

B000001FTH|5.0|Grace Jones was a huge star in Europe in the late 70s/early 80s with irresitable reggae/disco/dance tunes, and this compilation brings the essential tracks of that era.<br /><br />\\"Island Life\\" (released in 1985; 10 tracks; 48 min.) brings all of the hits of that era, starting with a clever interpretation of Edit Piaff's \\"La Vie On Rose\\", a massive hit in continental Europe. The radical dub reinventing of the Pretenders' \\"Private Life\\" is outstanding. I don't care much for the Roxy Music's cover of \\"Love Is the Drug\\". But the best tracks are on the second half of this compilation: \\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\" will get any wallflower onto the dance floor. \\"Walking In the Rain\\" is a desolate, threatening tune, just great. It leads up to the best track of all, \\"My Jamaican Guy\\", the best dance tune ever from Grace Jones. Almost 30 years later, is still stands the test of time, just outstanding.<br /><br />Grace Jones has come back with a new album last year (\\"Hurricane\\"), out of nowhere really (I haven't heard it yet, but plan to). She played a one-off gig in London not long ago that was well received, I can only hope she'll go on tour, I'd love to see her in concert. Meanwhile, if you are looking for a compilation of her best work from the legendary late 70s/early 80s era, look no further, this compilation will do more than well.

0452289963|5.0|After nearly 5 years of moderate to severe chronic depression, I was beginning to give up hope that I might ever feel joy again. Then I came across this book and something deep within me was re-awakened and I begun to understand how I could free myself from the suffering I was feeling but in a way that was so profound I knew I would never go back again to the state of despair I had experienced previously.     I had read many Buddhist, psychology, self help, and you name it texts that conveyed similar messages, but none of it I seemed to be able to apply or integrate fully and not just theoretically. His guidance is clear and applicable to any circumstance, while not discriminating or judging any belief system.     While maybe not all will be inspired and affected in the same way, this book does clarify these old somewhat ambiguous teachings with a different approach and unified way that perhaps we can all find something helpful.
0375826726|3.0|i plan to make this review fairly short and sweet so you get the general idea without reading 20 pages. i must agree with the fact that the book is too violent. though perhaps not as captivating as the Eldest, it is captivating in typical Paolini style. i agree with another review-writer that violence and limb hacking is played up. i am 19 yrs old and it was a little too discriptive for me.   also *spoiler warning* it is unclear whether eragon's mother was married to morzan, but it appeared as if they were not. their child murtaugh appears to have been born out of wed-lock as does eragon when he is born to murtaugh's mother and another man. it bothers me that paolini says something about the elves \\"mating\\" for a day or however long they want. (though i cant remember which book that was in) eragon's cousin gets his finance pregnant before they are married. Poalini also bothered me in that i felt that at times the characters (especially rohan) killed when it was not necessary. eragon seems to be more merciful as a great warrior should be.   im not intending to bash the book as it does have redeeming qualities. i simply wish to make people aware, especially to those who want to buy this as a gift or as a gift for a young person.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I don't buy as many DVD's anymore.  But, this one's a keeper.  It's full of action and just plain fun!
0786891181|4.0|This is an intriguing premise for a novel, and an inspirational idea in general.  Holly is a newly-widowed 29-year-old who discovers that her husband has left her a \\"list\\" of instructions for her to follow as she adjusts to life without him.  Some of the instructions are simple, some not, but all come from the love that they had for one another and his desire that she be okay on her own, as her own person.<br /><br />How Holly adjusts to this new scenario is very interesting - the people she was used to leaning on disappear, and ones who were always problematic turn out to be her best support.  I was especially pleased with the character of Holly's mother, Elizabeth, and the fact that she knows what to say (and, more importantly, what to leave unsaid).<br /><br />I was surprised by some of the sequences - there were points where I thought it would become conventional and then it went in a different direction entirely.  I love when that happens.  I think that Cecilia Ahern will continue to grow as an artist; as she gains experience, her style will show what she's learned.  She is a novelist well worth reading.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Despite some customers complaining that the two-disc special edition of \\"The Dark Knight\\" wasn't worth it, as a life-long Batman fan, I wanted the best available version of this movie, so I bought the special edition anyway and I have no regrets.  There are plenty of fun extra things on the second disc, and of course the movie itself is superb.<br /><br />I chalk it up to the whole country being shook up and ill-at-ease, but on the internet I've noticed more whining and complaining about most anything you'd care to name.  People are tending to be hyper critical and unhappy with Everything.<br /><br />I say enjoy what you can, get out of the negativity trap - and in the case of buying \\"The Dark Knight\\" on DVD, go for the gusto and get this two-disc edition.<br /><br />Randy B.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I think we have SG-1 to thank for the strong, running start Atlantis was given. Because we didn't have to do what SG-1 did--which was introduce nearly the entire concept of the Stargate to audiences--we had a strong foundation already created for the sister show. However, Atlantis did very well at not closely mimicking its predecessor but taking an idea already created and expanding it, literally, into an entirely new galaxy.<br /><br />Though I still hold that season 2 is probably the best of all five SGA seasons, season 1 gave Atlantis the strong foundation it needed to become a truly remarkable television series. The characters were strong and evolved over the course of twenty episodes to become people we could really relate with, care for, love, hate, sympathize with, laugh with and hurt for. As I will always openly admit, McKay is my favorite character and I thought he got a great start with episodes like Hide and Seek, The Storm and the Eye, The Brotherhood, Home, The Defiant One and Hot Zone. However, this was also a great season for seeing John Sheppard really come into being as a great character, especially in all the episodes mentioned above. Season one really saw the beginning of what becomes, what I think is, one of the greatest friendships in the Stargate universe.<br /><br />One of the things that made this season so great (and so different from all the others) is the concept of this team of explorers being completely isolated from their predecessors. With literally almost no ties to the show that began it all, season one of Stargate Atlantis was allowed to come into its own with nearly no interference from the show that began it all. I think that is one of the things that really helped make SGA strong. SG-1 was a great show, one of the best and hard to beat, but we needed to know that we were not just getting a repeat of the first eight seasons of SG-1 set in another galaxy. I think fans were pacified after the first few episodes.<br /><br />Season one was nearly perfect as an introductory season. The writers, cast and crew did a wonderful job at giving us something both familiar and unique.an introductory season.

B001P5HI4A|5.0|As i stopped watching the VHS many years ago, i had forgotten what a moving and emotional film this is for me. I was a teenager when the movie originally was released and watching as an adult, felt so many more layers of understanding and relevance to the complexities of sexuality,gender and love. The film has aged so well and is as compelling as it was 25 years ago. The performances are fantastic all around. The technical aspects are all improved over the VHS(DUH!) giving the film a lush, dreamy fairytale quality  I L-O-V-E, love Barbra Streisand. She continues to touch my heart after all these years. While Yentl is not a perfect film, it's heart is firmly in the right place.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I would rate season 3 as one of the best of Stargate Atlantis. Of the twenty episodes, I would rate nearly half of them as among my favorite from the entire series. Rodney McKay is my favorite character and since season 3 is a very McKay-centric episode, one can understand why I rate it among my favorites. I thought the character development (especially of McKay's character) was extensive, but season 3 did not shy away from the dramatic, the action-packed or the tragic.<br /><br />Season 3 probably had the highest combination of episodes that ranged from the hilarious to the tragic, from the frightening to the bittersweet. Though I do rate season 1 and 2 as equal to season 3, I also believe that season 3 was the peak of Atlantis's performance. I didn't get much better than this.

B001990LNW|4.0|I am torn when it comes to seeing the end of this show. On the one hand I am very sorry to see it go, but on the other hand I am glad they quit while they were ahead. Seasons 1-3 of Atlantis were AMAZING, but season 4 started to see a slow slide from what they had offered us earlier in the series and by season 5 I saw the danger of it becoming the next Stargate SG-1 season 9 which, in my opinion only, was the WORST of all ten seasons.<br /><br />Season 5 (and season 4, too, I think) saw a slow decline of the well-written character-based stories. In seasons 1-3 we got so many good story lines that really saw the evolution of characters, deepened their backgrounds and really helped to flesh out the characters and get us to know, love or hate them. However, season 5 really didn't do a whole lot with that and instead focused more on scrambling to wrap up a few loose ends. I do appreciate that they didn't leave some of the stories dangling uselessly, but I wish they could have done that with a little more character development as well.<br /><br />I will not complain about the last episode however. I shall obviously give away no details here, but I was pleased with the final episode of the season/series. There were a few holes and a few quick fixes that I could have done without or that I could have done with a little more explanation, but all together I thought it was a fitting end to the show.<br /><br />Now, having said all that I have previously, I cannot WAIT to have this on DVD. I have all four seasons available right now and love them and even though season 5, I think, is not the best of the series, I still would not be happy without it completing my collection of Stargate seasons (once I have season 5 I will have all fifteen seasons of the Stargate franchise). I am also very keen to see when and if they release this upcoming SGA movie they have promised us. The SG-1 movies were good (with Continuum being the best of the two, I think) and I would like to see them succeed with SGA movies, as well.as well.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I bought this set to be played on a regular progressive scan DVD player and a 1080i plasma tv.  The new graphics of the ship and the various planets look amazing and like they belong in the context of the show, not like modern special effects stuck in the middle of 1960's special effects.  I then upgraded to a blu-ray player, and the picture quality is even better than it was before (I refuse to buy an HD-DVD player to see the difference on the other side of the disk).  How much better can the picture get anyway?  This show was recorded in the 60's.  No matter how much cleanup of the originals are done, it was still recorded with 60's technology.  I like the extras like the previews for each episode, but I am missing out on some of the extras that are on the HD-DVD side.  Overall I recommend this set to anyone that doesn't already own the series, as a blu-ray set isn't due out for quite some time.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|Bryan Adams was always one of my favorite singers (and song writers for that matter) as I became an adult in the 80's. I have many fond memories of his music and this album seems to include all of the hits and songs I loved in one compilation. I got married in January and included \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\\" and \\"Can't Stop this Thing We Started\\" in our ceremony.

9562916464|4.0|(This is for the 4th Edition, not the original)<br /><br />Rules are the parents of art. When an artist creates something, and creates it effectively, she is almost assuredly doing it because of or in spite of a rule. People are the same way when it comes to their parents, and regardless of liking mom and dad, they're the ones everything goes back to. With a tome like The Elements of Style looming over the writing world, it doesn't make any sense not to read it. Even if you couldn't explain why you used the passive voice instead of the active voice, there is a rule out there says \\"use the active voice.\\" It's not just in Strunk & White. It's everywhere. The rules exist in a very abstract and touchy way, regardless of whether or not a writer is aware of them. To not read this book would be like getting really good at basketball without ever knowing anything about the sport beyond what you do in your driveway. You will eventually figure out that the ball goes into the hoop, and from there you'll figure out that you may bounce the ball every once in awhile, maybe you'll run and bounce it, and maybe you'll figure out the best way to throw the ball with both accuracy and quickness. It'll just take awhile, that's all. And don't count on making it to the NBA anytime soon. They like rules there, and working inside of them makes a lot of sense most of the time.<br /><br />So why did you use the passive voice instead of the active voice?<br /><br />The issue of \\"right and wrong\\" in creative writing is essentially the same as it is in music: if it sounds right, it is right. What good are scales if the coolest stuff isn't in any particular scale? Some great melodies, riffs, and licks have completely ignored music theory. Likewise, the cut-ups of Burroughs, the broken grammar of Bukowski, and the repetitive sentence structure of Hemingway all break a couple rules every once in awhile. Whether or not it's a conscious defiance is unimportant (because-of/spite-of) and the real focus should be on \\"How does doing this `incorrectly' improve the overall effect of the passage?\\"<br /><br />The best part of this book, even beyond laying the foundation for--at the very least--cognitive writing, is the way it challenges the reader to develop their style through constant questioning. I found myself disagreeing with the rules numerous times, saying \\"Well, I guess, but what if . . .\\" almost every page. I disagreed with the rule, but that didn't make it any less of a rule. Style is inherent. Grammar is not. With this book, you can work on both.doing this `incorrectly' improve the overall effect of the passage?\\"    The best part of this book, even beyond laying the foundation for--at the very least--cognitive writing, is the way it challenges the reader to develop their style through constant questioning.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|As a lover of American history, I thought this was one of the best presentations I have ever seen. The chapters, with recaps, kept the show moving at an interesting pace and I literally watched the entire miniseries in two days.<br />The character portrayals were excellent. I would recommend this miniseries about the often forgotten and neglected John Adams to all American history fans and to all students in American high schools!

0452287022|4.0|This book is written in a soft and subtle style, at the same time with a richness and acuity that let me walk in the world of Delft in Vermeer's time.  I felt like I could see the painting from the inside out.  The writer's style was congruent with the feeling of Vermeer's art -clear, beautiful, detailed.<br /><br />The story-line focuses on a young woman hired as a maid for the Vermeer family.  He decides to paint her.  The novel then fictionalizes the history behind Vermeer's great painting, 'The Girl wth the Pearl Earring;.

0671646788|4.0|Many people have self defeating negative thoughts and limiting beliefs that prevent them from realizing their potential. Dr. David Schwartz demonstrates the types of negative thoughts and limiting beliefs and how to replace them with positive thoughts vital for our self actualization.     Many self help books emphasize the same theme : negative thinking limits us and positive thinking unleashes the power we have within. These self help books are right in most part. But the thinking strategies they propose as solution although well intentioned seldom have any scientific basis or proof. Implementing them could be a loss of energy and time and may even be harmful : not eliminating negative thinking and the depression that comes with it. Therefore, I propose that the reader of such self help books resort to more scientifically valid methods and books such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Many of the strategies proposed in positive thinking self help books are based on Cognitive Psychology but deviate seriously from the scientific methodology. There are quite good books on Cognitive Behavioral Psychology, one of the best is \\" Cognitive Therapy, the basics and beyond \\" by Judith Beck, the daughter of the founder of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Aaron Beck.

B000066SBB|5.0|This double CD release covers 30 years of Aretha Franklin's career from the first 1967 Atlantic recordings till \\"A Rose is Still a Rose\\" from 1997.  Although there is no strict chronology in the running order,  on CD 1 emphasis has been put on the early years from 1967-71, and this is also where the majority of musical pearls are to be found. It is a pure pleasure to re-listen to classics like \\"Do Right Woman,\\" \\"Son of a preacher Man\\", \\"Respect,\\" \\"Chain of Fools,\\" \\"Think,\\" \\"A Natural Woman\\" and all the other great songs there.<br /><br />Numbers Like Elton John's \\"Border Song\\", the Beatles' \\"Let it Be\\" and many of the other covers of well-known classics become something completely different and exciting when they are exposed to Franklin's interpretations.<br /><br />CD 2 is logically a more uneven affair including  early tracks alongside more recent recordings. Her later material is generally does not live up to the high standards of the early recordings with producer Jerry Wexler.<br /><br />There are, however, exceptions like the Eurytmics collaboration \\"Sisters are Doing it for themselves\\" and Stevie Wonder's \\"Until You Come Back to Me\\".<br /><br />Among the early songs on CD 2 \\"Dark End of the Street\\" and \\"People Get Ready\\" stand out<br /><br />A very good buy if you just want a broad range of Franklin best numbers, but it may also very well turn into an appetizer for getting some of her early classic albums as \\"Never Loved a Man,\\" \\"Lady Soul\\", \\"Aretha Now\\" or \\"This Girl's in Love\\".

B001NFNFNA|5.0|2008 will undoubtedly be a memorable year for Hollywoods power couple, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Pitt had the magnificent \\"Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" which gained him a 2009 Best Actor Nomination and \\"Changeling\\" won Angelina a 2009 Best Actress Nomination. There were both given due to high levels of acting justification displayed by both sides, but most intensely on the side of Jolie.<br /><br />\\"Changeling\\" sees Jolie playing Christine Collins, a single Mother who made the headlines when her 9 year old son Walter, went missing. After 5 weeks of searching the L.A.P.D. claimed to have found a boy claiming to be Walter. A public reunion was organised between the mother and lost son, as a media circus to try and take away the attention from corruption scandals within the L.A.P.D. The boy is reunited with Collins but she claims he is not her son, but is forced to take him home \\"on a trial basis\\" so as to avoid police embarassment.<br /><br />Christine Collins keeps up the pressure on the Police to find her real son, but thanks to the cruelty of Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) her pleas are not listened to and she's forced to take matters into her own hands. She gets dental records and teacher testimonials to confirm the boy who's claimed to be her son in fact is not. Jones gets a bit tired of all the hassle he's receiving and the negative press attention to case is receiving, so he authorises her to be locked in a mental hospital. Not all is lost as her guardian angel Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). He and his congregation are the only people who believe her and they join the fight to find out the truth and rid L.A. of corruption.<br /><br />The setting of 1920's Los Angeles is cleverly depicted and helps make the story and its characters all the more authentic. Clint Eastwood has a genuine talent for creating an emotional moment and drawing its audience in and engaging them with the characters. This is obviously helped with the use of 5 star actors and that is no more apparent here. Angelina Jolie plays the role amazingly and next to Gia, in my eyes this is one of her best genuine acting performances. She didn't need to sex up the role, or become all angry and violent, she just told the story of a Mother who had lost her son and wasn't believed by the people who were meant to protect her.<br /><br />John Malkovich plays a good role as Briegleb and seemed to delve so deep in the role, I actually didn't recognise it was him until I saw the credits at the end. Jeffrey Donovans, J.J. Jones comes across as sincerely evil and sadistic and just unconcerned with this womans plight.<br /><br />The fact that this story is based on factual events makes the film all the more terrifying. How the Police Department could destroy a womans and their publics trust by trying to cover up their mistake for PR purposes. Of course there are aspects of the story that are either changed or removed completely for the sakes of the film, which is OK as they're relatively small aspects that have been amended<br /><br />It's an amazing film and possibly Angelina's best, and if she does win that Oscar she's nominated for, then it's well deserved.re apparent here.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a musical about an aspiring super villain applying for a position in the Evil League of Evil.  One might think this sounds like a childish premise, but Joss Whedon, et al, pull it off.  The music and storyline are alternately extra cheesy and genuinely touching.  It's an emotional stew, indeed, and Neal Patrick Harris is perfect for the role of Dr. Horrible.  He's goofy, but he also honestly wants to be taken seriously as an evil genius.  Better yet, Harris can sing, and he knows when it's right to be cheesy and right to be melodramatic.  But Harris doesn't entirely carry the show.  Nathan Fillion is superb as the superhero Captain Hammer, and Felicia Day is wonderful as Penny, Dr. Horrible's love interest.    The DVD features are great.  You get all episodes of the main feature, plus two commentaries, one of which is a separate musical.  There's the obligatory making of the movie and composing of the music, and there's also a nice collection of Evil League of Evil \\"application\\" videos made by fans of the show.     Not since Whedon's Firefly series have I seen something so anti-television as Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.  Even if you haven't liked Whedon's past work, and if you like How I Met Your Mother even remotely, you will love Neal Patrick Harris in this show.  Dr. Horrible is refreshing and intelligent, and it has a kind of reexamination of the imaginative spirit of comic books and musicals.  American culture hasn't forgotten to read its comic books (i.e., the recent Spider-man, X-men, and Batman movies), but we have forgotten the place of the musical (Southpark: The Musical notwithstanding) in our society.  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog brings the musical back, challenges it to a duel, and wins everyone over.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|after waiting for weeks to receive Mamma Mia I was so excited and put it in my video player straight away but was bitterly disappointed because I couldn't watch it because I was in the wrong area !!!  I had no idea that there were different codes it was not pointed out to me when I ordered - surely the fact that my address was in Spain would have informed you that the DVD was not correct for me.   I also did not realise that I was in fact ordering a USA version which is completely useless in Spain on my player anyway.  So I shall not order anything from you again.  I think you should set up information pointing out that DVDs may not be compatible with European players so this error will not be repeated.    I would like to point out also that I regularly buy music instruction videos for my banjo playing from the USA and all of these are compatible with my player, and also arrive within 5 to 7 days.

That about wraps up my experience with Cake.    This is easily one of my favorite albums of all time, and certainly my favorite Cake album.  \\"Sheep Go to Heaven\\" and \\"Let Me Go\\" are highly contagious, both lyrically and musically.    And please don't let the title of track 1 prevent you from enjoying the infectious groove and wonderful metaphors.  Whether or not you believe in God, Satan, etc., you will see yourself in John McCrea's words.  This album is not to be missed.
0307269752|5.0|Instead of retelling the story, I'll make a few of my general observations about what made the book so surprisingly readable:<br /><br />1.  How many books have you read written by a Swedish author from a Swedish perspective?  I found it fascinating to compare what must be the norm regarding Swedish businessmen, a somewhat more liberal feeling about sexual relationships, friendship, normal food, living quarters, all things Swedish.<br /><br />2.  The author was a trained journalist, knows the rules and law of journalism and accurately portrays the writing  and publishing world which can sometimes be brutal and highly competitive.<br /><br />3.  How many of the royal business families in the United States are made up of dozens and dozens of heirs who are made up partially of spoiled and  troubled people with sometimes creepy lives?  The story here is very believable, goes back a couple of generations where the main character journalist is able to uncover some family Nazi roots and bad behavior which have permeated down to the current generation.<br /><br />4.  One of the most compelling and excellent things about the book is the creation of a waifish, backward, tattooed and pierced girl who seems like a total outcast and belongs in an institution.  But as her personality and skills start to unfold and mix with the journalist main character,  she becomes this amazing and even lovable character and I have to admit, that I cared deeply for her and kept holding my breath hoping she wouldn't die.<br /><br />5.  The story is long, meticulous, gets into detail that main American detective writers would never take time to do.  And yet, it is this careful, slow work that makes it all the more believable and when some solutions start to emerge, it has been well worth the wait.<br /><br />6.  There were a few things that were a bit strange to me, a bit over the top, didn't quite seem right, but I don't want to give anything away here.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I'm very excited for the next book to come out and I can't believe I have to wait until July.<br /><br />The book is adult and R rated with some scenes that will be offensive and hard to take for some readers.can't believe I have to wait until July.

031606792X|5.0|This book was a great book.  I couldn't wait to get started reading and find out what happened next in Bella's life.  I loved this book and wish it was not the end of Bella, but I know it has too end sometime.  Thank you Stephenie Meyer for the great Twilight Saga Series of books Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.  I have loved every word.
1572816112|5.0|These are my first set of tarot cards. I have found them easy to use and already surprisingly accurate. I love the mysterious and unusual pictures, that was part of the reason I chose them. I find the cards thought provoking and emotive. I recommend them to you!
B0018AVNKC|4.0|I just saw the new movie Coraline with several 8-to-10 year old girls. It was amazing but also downright freaky. It features many themes that are potentially disturbing for any age. It gets down to the basics of what happens if your parents ignore you and you decide to run away...what if your fantasy Mom turns into a monster...and for me, what is the nature of an evil, suffocating mother.    The stop-motion animation was truly breathtaking, and we didn't even see it in 3-D. I'd say that whether it's too scary for a child depends on the child's temperament and sensitivity rather than age. This intense, thoughtful movie is meant to be challenging.    Dakota Fanning's vocal performance combined with the animation nailed the character of a disgruntled tween girl. Loved her convincing Michigan accent.    Coraline reminded me of so many different works:  [[ASIN:B00000JS62 The Wizard of Oz]]  [[ASIN:B001AIRUOU The Nightmare Before Christmas]]  [[ASIN:0689040342 The Spiderwick Chronicles (Boxed Set): The Field Guide; The Seeing Stone; Lucinda's Secret; The Ironwood Tree; The Wrath of Mulgrath]]  [[ASIN:B000UX6THK Twin Peaks]] (dramatically bizarre characters were David Lynchian)  [[ASIN:B00005JLTK The Ring]] (the super-creepy Japanese horror film. Just a little cross-over there but significant to me.)  [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]  [[ASIN:B00079FUI6 Desperate Housewives]] (Terri Hatcher is the voice of the Mom, and the more evil she gets, the more she looks like a character from Desperate Housewives.)    and, the real-life case of Nadya Suleman, mother to octuplets + 6. I can't help but mention this current reference, because I kept thinking about her when they explored the psychology of the perfect/evil Other Mother.    I am giving this four stars because it's bizarre and scary enough to be polarizing--as much genuine brilliance as it has in it, it's extraordinarily strange, too. Some families will love it and some will hate it. Now that I've seen the whole story, I for one would like to see the movie again, next time in 3-D.
0618918248|5.0|What I appreciate most about Dawkins is the accessibility of his writing.  Whether or not you agree with his argument, his book is interesting and engaging.  He is also very funny.  I found myself laughing out loud many times. As other reviewers have noted, his book isn't going to change any minds.  If you're not religious, you will agree with him; if you are religious, you will be deeply offended.  Part of what intrigued me was the overall controversy of the book, and Dawkins made sure to give me controversy.  His argument is definitely shocking and taboo, but at least he gets us talking about something that was previously brushed under the rug.  I have to agree that religion shouldn't be off-limits when we're willing to discuss everything else.
0071359168|4.0|The cover of my old 1970s book has a picture of a chess board, and this symbol codifies the essence of the positioning concept: How do you differentiate your product from competing products in a way that is attractive to a customer?<br /><br />Positioning was a break from Rossier Reeve's 1950s Unique Selling Proposition, which focuses on benefits of the product itself, and David Ogilvy's 1960s Image Advertising concept, which focuses on allusive images. Years later the concept of Value Propositions gained steam; it measures value as the difference between cost and benefits.<br /><br />Nowadays the more emotional concept of branding is popular, along with the idea of interactive connections with consumers (e.g., think about the value of Amazon book reviews as a differentiator). And for new to-this-world offerings, I've often found it's best to plainly describe what it does.  Additionally, many focus on the \\"Elevator Statement,\\" which is really just a forced simplicity of your positioning statement.<br /><br />The problem with Positioning is that singular product differences are often too small to matter; suspicion about claims is high; the ability of advertising to achieve effective reach and frequency is enormously expensive nowadays; and many products are bought on emotion. Still, positioning can work well if you are first, the unqualified best, the biggest, or the only one in a market. The concept is also useful as a way of thinking about a product and market.<br /><br />The book is written in the manner of advertising, so it's a quick and easy read.  There is also a good list of questions to help you focus your position:<br /><br />1. What position do you own?<br />2. What position do you want to own?<br />3. Whom must you outgun?<br />4: Do you have enough money?<br />5. Can you stick it out?<br />6. Do you match your position?<br /><br />The positioning concept is a good contribution to marketing, as are the others mentioned above.  It is, however, a bit outdated, and overly muscular. And Al Ries leans on war as a metaphor for marketing. But you could just as easily state that the best marketing is about love.<br /><br />Here are a few related contemporary marketing books to investigate. The ones most specifically aligned with Positioning include Jumpstart Your Business Brain and Relationship Marketing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:074327797X Primalbranding: Create Zealots for Your Brand, Your Company, and Your Future]]<br />[[ASIN:0201622408 Relationship Marketing: Successful Strategies For The Age Of The Customer]]<br />[[ASIN:0887309798 Radical Marketing: From Harvard to Harley, Lessons from Ten That Broke the Rules and Made It Big]]<br />[[ASIN:1578601797 Jump Start Your Business Brain: Scientific Ideas and Advice That Will Immediately Double Your Business Success Rate]]r marketing.

006056251X|4.0|This was my first Lisa Kleypas book and I must say, I really really love her style. I loved the characters, I liked the plot line, I liked that there was no boring background that didn't add anything to the story, and the tender moments between them were great. Sebastian was adorable and I found myself rooting for him, which is not always the case in these books. All in all, I'm pretty picky about romance books and I havn't found too many that I really truly enjoyed, but this one I did. I don't give out five stars unless the book makes it on my keeper shelf and I feel like telling my friends about it, but this one is definitely worth reading and was a fun little afternoon escape, which is what a romance novel should be.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is a great family movie. Very funny in all ways. There was nothing I didn't like about it. Great cast of actors. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE AND ALL.    AWANAKARD
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|I never really have watched that many movies with Clint Eastwood in it and probably wouldn't of watched this one either, but I came across a copy so I checked it out. I wasn't dissappointed by it but it also wasn't what I expected, actually I thought this was gonna be more of a shoot em up with Clint behind the gun's but was kinda wrong, in a way. I didn't expect the racism and I didn't expect the ending that was. Clint is a ex Korean War Vet who just so happen's to live in a neighborhood full of Koreans, which by the way he dislikes and has names for them like \\"Zipperhead, Swamp Rats and Gooks\\". His wife has just died and the family is at the funeral, the family in which Clint Dislikes. After the funeral they end up at his house and find out more to why he dislikes his family (they just want him for what he has). Anyhow his next door neighbors have kids which are teenaged Koreans, one boy one girl. So one day the korean boy is walking home when he is approached by a gang of mexicans who mess with him. All of a sudden the korean boy cousin and his gang come around a corner and see whats going on. They come up on the mexicans and guns flash but no shots and the mexicans drive off, so his cousin and friends try to get him to join their gang but thats not the kinda of boy he is. But soon enough they convince him to try and join and the only way to get in the gang is to steal Clints Grand Torino. The boy ends up trying but gets caught by clint and almost gets shot, the only shot Clint fires in the whole movie. After that the boys cousin and friends end up attacking him on Clints front lawn and Clint pulls out his gun and tells em to get lost. After that the whole neighborhood starts to like Clint for saving the boy, but its praise he does not want. He finally gives in one day as the korean boys sister becomes friends with Clint. He starts to go around and let them come around him more often and he becomes friends with the family including the boy who tryed to steal his car and ends up taking the boy under his wing and shows him how to become more of a man. Soon Clint starts to really connect with the 2 kids and see them as more of a family than his actual family. I really don't wanna tell the whole story but it really is an excellent one. Its funny at times and is to me very sad. There is quite a few racist remarks in this movie but nothing really that bad if you can see past them. I really liked Anhey Her, which is the sister and thought she did an excellent job. Oh and the ended was not what I thought it was gonna be but wasn't bad, just sad. Like I said I dont wanna give away the whole story or the ending but some of yall might cry. I hope this review has been helpful enough to make you decide on watching this movie, as I'm tired of getting told my reviews are unhelpful.car and ends up taking the boy under his wing and shows him how to become more of a man.

1882723007|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!  Whether you are interested in near-death experiences or a more spiritual exploration, this book covers it all.  Many things were confirmed for me and I enjoy reading this book over the seasons.  Well written and clear for all ages.

0786888628|5.0|A well-written masterpiece. Very critical of General MacArthur's push to the Yalu River in 1950 in which the UN forces fanned out across the wide spaces of northern North Korea, exposing the UN troops to the Chinese onslaught.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Batman is back with a vengeance! Everyone did an awesome job, especially Heath Ledger as the psychopathic Joker! The Joker is both funny and scary. Other than Batman, The Joker was my favorite character! I'm surprised they had Harvey Dent being Two-Face and becoming a bad guy in this movie. I thought they would save him for the 3rd one. If you are hard-core Batman fans, you'll love THE DARK KNIGHT!!!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This is an unusual mix of courtroom drama and old-school horror. As the former it's reasonably, though not notably, successful, but where this film does score is in its depiction of the torment and fear suffered by the eponymous teenage girl who believes herself possessed by demons. This is a movie that provides shudders through the things glimpsed in the dark rather than those that leap out at you dripping gore. Creeping dread is created with little more than suggestion, and, although the exorcism itself is dealt with more explicitly, this is where the film is at its most effective.    However much of this is faithful to the real story (which involved a poor Bavarian girl), and whether you side with the scientific or the spiritual explanation of these tragic events, this still a gripping story that is let down only by poor pacing and structure. It deserves four stars, however, for the way it handles the fear of the unknown.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|I thought this was pretty good. It had a lot of good action sequences. This one continues after the original and having James Bond going rogue and avenging Vesper's death and finding the bad guy. There were a couple of boring parts, but other than that, it's a pretty good Bond film. If you love the James Bond series, you'll love QUANTUM OF SOLACE!!!
B0009UC810|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The extended edition runs a bit too long and the Carrie Fisher subplot always seemed a bit bizarre to me, but The Blues Brothers is a lot of fun for the entirety of its running length, never taking a break between high-energy music, car chases, and hateful Illinois Nazis.
1416595546|4.0|After having a hard time getting into the story line, this book took me to a Russia I never knew.  Through the life of a single woman, beginning at age 16, the author shows us a vivid picture of the political changes in Russian history.  Sashenka is a young bourgeous born girl, well educated, pampered, and Jewish.  She is also a dedicated Bolshevik, helping to bring down the Tsarist Empire in 1916.  The story of her youth is peppered with arrest, intrigue, self doubt, fanaticism and a desperately dysfunctional family who make it easy for her to embrace the promise of revolution.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1939.  Sashenka is married to a Communist party leader and they have two much loved and adored young children.  She is a respected Communist role model and lives a near idyllic life as the editor of a Communist magazine aimed at helping women become good Communist wives and women.  Stalin's Terror has been declared at an end, and yet people live in mortal fear of doing or saying the wrong things.  Even those who celebrate the victory of the party and the Soviet workers fear the very people who they claim to respect the most.  The religious reverence that was given to Marx, Lenin and Stalin is mixed with stark terror among the leadership and the workers alike.  A single indescretion by Sashenka leads to a family disaster and the end of Sashenka's life as a respected Bolshevik and dedicated Communist as she and her family are devoured by the very party to which they dedicated their lives.  The author describes the destruction of Sashenka's family in agonizing detail.<br /><br />Again, fast forward to 1994.  Communism has fallen in the USSR and the people are concentrating on building a Socialist community.  Katinka Vinsky, a young woman from a remote village in the northern Caucasus, has been hired as a researcher by a family in London to find the family background of a woman, by the name of Roza, who was adopted out of Stalinist Russia.  Although Stalin has been dead for decades, the people have been well trained to keep their heads down, to never attract attention, to avoid confrontation and to never oppose the powers that be.  The pervading fear and distrust of political leaders remains, despite their political \\"liberation\\".  Katinka attacks her duties with fervor.  She meets the few surviving characters from Stalin's Terror, encounters the remaining faction of old-style Communism, and finds the story of Sashenka's family and their ultimate fate, along with some sordid and surprising details.<br /><br />The author has done his homework well.  He does not hold back when it comes to political commentaries, but they are so encased in the story line that the reader accepts them as fact.  There are no diatribes.  There are no lectures.  He simply tells the story and lets it speak for itself--which it does loudly and eloquently.<br /><br />I had a hard time getting into the story at first.  My Russian history is not good, so it didn't really grab me until the second part, set in the 1930's, in which Sashenka seems to be living her dream.  There is an underlying foreboding throughout this portion of the book that is so subtle and yet so terrifying that I couldn't stop reading.  The characters became real here and the first part of the book made complete sense as I read this part.<br /><br />Part three was somewhat predictable, but that fact didn't take away from the satisfaction of the ending or the message of the book.  Rather, it reinforced it and made it a very complete package.<br /><br />I've learned a lot from reading this book.  I've learned that my world history is \\"Americanized\\" and shallow.  I've learned that any political system that depends on force and strong arm tactics is inherently dangerous, regardless of its goals.  I've learned that all political systems are subject to the whims of the leaders and that power corrupts even the best of men. (Actually, I already knew that, but this story made it so absolutely clear.)  I learned that the plight of the Russian people is far from over and that the consequences of the Stalinist style of government are further reaching than we, as Westerners, can ever know.<br /><br />There are a lot of other lessons in this book, but I recommend a thorough reading to sort them all out.  I, myself, am going to reread this one and hopefully get it all the second time around.  Many thanks to this author for reminding me that history is, first and foremost, about people, individuals and families who all have their own stories to tell.ian people is far from over and that the consequences of the Stalinist style of government are further reaching than we, as Westerners, can ever know.

B0001WTVUW|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The first half of the Day After sometimes feels hokey and dated, but the powerhouse second hour does a very good job dealing with the aftermath of nuclear war in small town America; helped by solid turns by Jason Robards and John Lithgow, it's a good choice if you like post-apocalyptic scenarios.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I was a novice buying DVD's and didn't realize they don't all play on every player, I now have a great series I cannot watch or return because I opened it and tried to play it.  The option of setting up my own account and reselling it is daunting so I wasted my money.  To bad.  All I really wanted was to watch it.
B00001W9G0|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Though The Way We Were should be praised for not following a formulaic plotline, the complete dearth of chemistry between the leads and clumsy insertion of a McCarthyism subplot make this film a mixed bag; if you like romances you might like this one, but there are far better options out there.
0307277453|5.0|In \\"Your Inner Fish\\" Neil Shubin shares a number of inspiring stories from his life as a scientist. He leads an extraordinary scientific career, where he is an authority on both developmental biology and palenthology. This means that he does not only travel the world looking for transitional evoluationary fossil, but he also performs molecular biology experiments in order to identify genes involved in generating body plans and whose mutation can mechanistically explain evolutionary transitions.     Dr. Shubin's style is clear and eloquent. He takes us on his trip to the Canadian Arctic that resulted in the discovery of Tiktaalik; the first vertebrate who left the water to explore the land, and whose fossil shows clear evidence for the evolutionary transition from fish to amphibians. Between 2006 and 2008, Dr. Shubin has followed up on his original discovery and has been a senior author on 5 \\"Nature\\" articles that provide mechanistic/genetic insight on the evolution of the limbs and skull in terrestrial vertebrates.    Throughout the book, Dr. Shubin discusses evidence for evolution that comes not only from the fossil record, but also from embryology and comparative anatomy. His discussion of the similarity between hands and fins, hair and scales and the evolution of gills to the products of pharyngeal arches in humans is one of the most interesting account on these issues in popular science. First year medical students may be particularly interested in reading this book prior to starting their embryology course as it can make the material much more interesting.     This book is simply brilliant as is Neil Shubin's career. In fact, I will not be surprised if Neil Shubin wins the Nobel Prize for his amazing contribution to our understanding of who we are and where we come from. As Stephen Colbert commented when he hosted Dr. Shubin on his show, \\"Great! Now not only will your grandfather order the scrod, he IS the scrod!\\"
B00006D295|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie that apparently needs a live audience, Rocky Horror is simply not that good a film to stand on its own; the first half is very lively and much of the music worth listening to, but as the screenplay begins to make less and less sense the movie gets far less enjoyable to watch.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|When I was a kid I loved my wood blocks, now as a parent I am buying them for my daughter and she loves them too.  She has played with them from 18 months on, at first stacking and placing them in and out of the container.  Then she began to stack them and see how high the tower would get before it fell.  She used them for counting as she was learning to count.  And as she gets older she builds more complicated structures.  As an architect, I love to build things and this is a toy we play with together.  I love them and they are definitely worth the purchase.
B00019074O|2.0|The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A stupid comedy that is sophomoric at best and moronic at worst, Police Academy has probably only garnered its status as a \\"classic\\" because its sequels are so poorly-regarded that even this looks good by comparison; please don't watch this when there are literally thousands of better movies you could spend your time or money on.
B0000019PA|5.0|Sure, I consider myself enlightened and open-minded.  I listened to the samples and didn't get it.  But one review struck me: \\"accept it on it's own terms.\\"  So I bought it.    When I popped it into my home stereo and heard the grating voice of Jeff Magnum, especially on the second song, I had to quickly turn the volume down in embarrassment.  Awful.    A day later I played it for my 14 year-old son saying \\"so I missed on this one...isn't it awful?\\"      The next day I listened to it in my car.  Still awful, but there was something...    A couple of listens later it clicked.  And it became the most exquisite CD I've ever heard.      It's been about two years since then, and it has become my most cherished musical treasure.  And the funny thing is, my three kids -- 16, 14 and 12 years old have all downloaded it on to their iPOD's.  They feel it too.    I'm just very glad that I \\"get it\\" and that I've passed it on to another generation.  Truly a \\"life-changing\\" musical maseterpiece.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Great documentary. A slap in the face of the idiot Bush and his administration who have ruined the country, the world, and the planet by their stupid policies.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|having seen this brilliant production of who's afraid of Virginia wolf i was delighted with its vibrancy and unique setting. the passion and humour was all the more worth watching. best seen when you have nothing else to intrude on your time and you give it your total dedication as only this masterpiece requires.
B000EWBKKI|3.0|First off, this is the regular theatrical cut of T2. Not the uncut version, which almost all of us prefer. So don't expect any of the extra footage. Alright, so this is the Blu Ray edition of T2: Judgment Day so it should be amazing like the movie right? NO. This Blu Ray edition features no special features, a regular DTS-6.1 audio soundtrack and a MPEG-2 video transfer. Thus, the film looks grainy (which is not good for this film), colors can look washed out and the black levels aren't the best. Detail is good, and close up shots look great but given that this is one of the earliest BR releases, it doesn't live up to today's standard. Don't get me wrong, it does look better than the DVD editions for the most part but it doesn't justify a true high definition version of this film. So we have a sub-par looking high definition release of T2 that lacks any special features (Come on, no special features at all? We've had like 5 releases of the film on DVD loaded with so much bonus features and this has none?? WHY?). All in all, is it worth the money? Not really. I found this at Wal-Mart for a flat $10.00 so it was worth it just to watch it again but not the same can be said for everyone else. My opinion, if you own the DVD and a Blu Ray player, you're good for now. In May when the new Terminator film releases, there will be a new release of T2 that will present a better video and audio transfer as well as some special features and multiple versions of the film. It's called the SkyNet Edition. There's also supposed to be a Ultimate Edition with like 6 discs, featuring every edition of the movie on DVD plus the Blu Ray version. Just wait.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|The only reason I watched this movie was because Robert Downey Jr. was in it. Watching Ben Stiller play next to Robert Downey Jr. was gut wrenching to say the least. Robert Downey Jr. preformed flawlessly of course and carried the poor script and most of the scenes as much as possible. Ben Stiller was horrible however, proving once again that he has no acting talent what so ever. Tom Cruise pulled off his disguised nasty producer part pretty good except for his dancing scenes. I have seen several of Ben Stiller's movies and he just never seems to get any better. Someone please drag him to acting school and chain him a desk so he can learn something. Can I have my movie rental money back please?
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have played many board games, from the simple (checkers) to the most complex (Advanced Squad Leader). I want to say that 'Settlers' is by far the most enjoyable game in that 'in between' realm, but I think it goes past that. There are no two ways of saying it; 'Settlers' is fun, for the \\"serious\\" gamer and for the family getting together again. Put the Monopoly away (no disrespect at all) and play this game.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I recently ordered this product new from Amazon and am very happy with my purchase. I was a little concerned reading some of the reviews when customers continued to have problems with season 3. I do agree that the package could cause possible damage but, turn them around and you shouldn't have a problem. I have watched every season and no problems!!!! If you love SATC, this is for you and you can't beat the lower price!

B000001ZS3|5.0|The re-mastering of the tracks for this CD was well beyond the usual level of quality.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in my life. I am amazed at the bad reviews being given here - to those of you who are too pretentious and/or nearsighted to appreciate this film, I feel sorry for you. This movie is well worth owning.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Fragile is the favorite of most listeners of Yes.  I was lucky enough to go to Yes's Fragile concert at Miami University in 1972. Great Concert with a lot of voice and keyboards.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|Great add on. Had to get used to the movement of the buttons but adds a great dynamic to the controller
B00007KWHN|5.0|Great music that brings back memories.  Many people haven't any knowledge of their style or their music.  With today's music a step back is a step forward.
0316143472|4.0|YAY!  Sedaris is back!  I loved this book.<br /><br />I was wary because my Sedaris reading history had been mixed - ranging from the sublime \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to the awful \\"Barrel Fever\\".  With \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" he's back to sublime.<br /><br />I think I actually liked it better than \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" because he seems to have mellowed with age.  He still has a smart, acerbic wit - but he's not mean in this book.  In fact there are even some stories that while still funny have more heart than his work in the past.<br /><br />My favorite essay from the book was \\"April in Paris\\" where he talks about his *relationship* with a house spider he adopts and names April.  Bitingly funny, but sweet nonetheless.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it - IMO it's Sedaris at his best.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Truly diverse and one of a kind.  The Boss jumps from genre to genre in each tune and pulls it off with the help of the E Street Band.  This is Springsteen in a whole other mood than his past few albums, which were also very good.  If you like \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" from \\"Magic\\", you will love this album.  Upbeat all the way.  Best cuts are \\"My Lucky Day\\", \\"Surprise, Surprise\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Good Eye\\".  \\"The Last Carnival\\" is a tribute to Danny Federici, and it will bring a tear to your eye.  The DVD is great too, showing the band creating a masterpiece.
B00129H7VS|5.0|To be brief, this is a spectacular mini-series. Well shot, well written and well acted. If you've never seen it before I highly recommend it and definitely this is the format for which to experience it.    Now, as for the Blu-ray version specifically, it looks and sounds phenomenal. This is a great transfer. The producers definitely took care when authoring this version. That said, because of the stylistic nature of the way it was shot, if you are someone who can't really tell the difference between DVD and Blu-ray - and you already own this on DVD - you probably shouldn't bother. But, if like me, the differences are like night and day, get this set. You absolutely will not regret it.

0525476881|5.0|I've had this one on my list ever since I read and loved Looking for Alaska, but I just hadn't managed to tackle it yet. Part of the reason behind that, I think, was that the description just didn't grab me the way Looking for Alaska did, or some of the other books in my to-be-read stack. But now I can definitely say I wish I hadn't waited so long - I think I like this one even better than Alaska.    The book in a nutshell: self-described \\"washed-up child prodigy\\" Colin Singleton has only ever dated Katherines, and has just been dumped by Katherine the 19th. In an attempt to get Colin out of the dumps, his best friend Hassan decides it's time for a road trip. Somehow they end up in Gutshot, Tennessee, where they meet a girl named Lindsey and her mom, who owns a tampon string factory and soon hires Hassan and Colin. Oh, and Colin's trying to come up with a mathematical theorem to determine who will be the dumpee and dumper in every relationship. And then there's Archduke Franz Ferdinand's grave, a crazy hunting trip, and lots and lots of anagrams. Crazy fun!    I think maybe part of the reason I liked this one so much is that Colin is SO the type that I would've gone for in high school. I love the hot geeky boys! I can't count out Hassan, though. At first it seemed like he was just there to fulfill the funny fat kid sidekick role, but luckily Green didn't fall into that trap, and he ends up being a really interesting, likeable character in his own right. I'd actually kind of like to see a sequel focusing on Hassan and his adventures.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|Trying to describe FF's music is like trying to describe the expression on the face of the Mona Lisa.  Their inscrutability is part of their charm.  It's a rock sound, but not in the traditional sense.  It's pop, but heavier than most.  You can dance to it, but it goes deeper than that.  Their 3 albums, while retaining a consistency of sound, represent a process of evolution.  The second one was a smooth but noticeable maturity over the first.  This third one takes it all further.<br /><br />Takes what further?  Well, that's the part that is hard to explain.  Lyrically, their songs are what they always have been:  urbane, playful, clever and sly.  There are insinuations and innuendos, frequently sexual, in many lines, but it's hard to pin down their exact meaning.  For instance, in \\"No You Girls\\" there's \\"kiss me where your eye won't meet me\\".  What, exactly, is meant by that?  In \\"Live Alone\\" the singer says fervently \\"Wherever you are, I'll be wishing I could be there\\", then casually mentions a NYC taxi driver and wants the driver to imagine having a drink with him (?).  Further, one song can represent a world of innuendo in itself, not clearly explained but somehow still having a vague validity.  \\"Bite Hard\\" asks, among other questions, \\"Are you happier now that the gods are dying?\\"  \\"Lucid Dreams\\" is all about dream worlds, including flying to Istanbul.  All this is OK.  We learned from The Beatles and Bob Dylan that the lyrics of pop music poetry don't have to have a concrete literal meaning to convey an idea or feeling.<br /><br />Musically, \\"e\\" words come to mind:  \\"experimental\\", \\"energetic\\"  and \\"entertaining\\".  FF manages to incorporate many genres of past and present pop into a cohesive whole.  \\"Ulysses\\" starts things off with a strong bass line, techno trimmings and an invitation to get high. \\"Turn It On\\" is a Beatle-ish track with a Beatle-ish chorus, in which the title is repeated by backup vocals and even includes the well-known \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\".  \\"No You Girls\\" includes strangely altered, echoed voices.  \\"Send Him Away\\" is on the bluesy side.  In \\"Twilight Omens\\" Alex plays word games with his intended's name and number, against a background of what I would call maybe Russian or Eastern European music, very fitting since the band's name is the same as that of the archduke of Austria-Hungary whose assassination helped ignite World War I.  There are blends of 60's acid rock and 70's disco in \\"Bite Hard\\", \\"What She Came For\\", \\"Live Alone\\" and \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\".  \\"Lucid Dreams\\" has a LONG freakout ending which grows more and more complicated.  After it fades out, a ballad comes along to comfort you, with a soft, eerie tune and quirky lyrics, again about dreaming.  \\"Katherine Kiss Me\\" ends it all as a folky acoustic love song, with FF-typical lyrics like \\"You glance a ricochet from every alpha male behind me...\\"<br /><br />In my review of \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\", I compared FF to The Beatles, and I didn't do that lightly.  I didn't mean they are as good as The Beatles, but they do remind me of them, in their experimental music and unconventional lyrics.  They have great potential.  This album only encourages me to stand by that comparison.cludes strangely altered, echoed voices.  \\"Send Him Away\\" is on the bluesy side.

B000BSLU2S|4.0|I think there's only 3 important things when it comes to thermal grease for your heatsink/cpu: don't use too much, don't use too little, and make sure you spread it evenly when you apply your heatsink. These aspects are much more important to me rather than picking the right brand with fancy naming, colors, packaging, etc. It's about like motor oil or air filters for your car in that it doesn't matter which brands you use. I picked this stuff up for cheap, and it works just fine. And I don't even run a fan on my heatsink, just 120mm case fans.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Until sometime during my college years, my rudimetary understanding about the division of labo(u)r in Beatledom was as follows: John Lennon was the edgy experiementalist while Sir Paul McCartney wrote the pretty pop tunes.  While there is some validity to this perspective, I later learned that Sir Paul was a lot more responsible for the Beatles' trip into a more avant garde-influenced psychedelic sound than I had previously realized.  For example, the tape loops on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (the closing track on the psychedelic Revolver album) were largely McCartney's idea, which came from experimenting with removing the erase head from the tape recorder which the band was using at the time (you can look this up and read the whole story if you so desire).  If you consider these early products of studio experimentation to be a form of electronic music- making (or \\"electronica\\"), it seems like McCartney was an original pioneer in the pop-electronica world.<br /><br />McCartney's solo work after the dissolution of the Beatles did not, until 2008, really seem to follow up on the possibilities of electronic experimentation which the former Beatle had pioneered.  He preferred a more stripped-down sound which served him well but didn't do much to change his reputation as being purely a popster.  However this disc (which many view as a departure but which actually could be seen as a return to his experimental roots in the Beatles' mid-period) shows the aging star still willing to experiment with new, edgier sounds.<br /><br />When I heard about this one I approached it with trepidation, picturing McCartney singing over some kind of thumpy club music in an effort to appear relevant to the kiddies (the image I had in my head was of U2's [[ASIN:B000001EAQ Pop]], easily my least favorite in their catalog).  However I read enough good reviews to take the plunge and am I ever glad I did.  This thing is a flat-out masterpiece.<br /><br />I don't know much about the musician(s) involved in this project beyond McCartney, however I can say that the former Beatle has found a great musical partner (the producer Youth) who is able to tastefully integrate modern electronica into McCartney's world without disrupting the fundmental McCartney-ness of the music.  That is, Paul McCartney may try a lot of different things sonically, but everything he does is stamped with his unique musical persona.  Youth respects that and works with it rather than trying to work around it or cover it up.  Some of this material rocks harder than anything McCartney has recorded in decades (the opening track for example), some is reminiscent of White Album-era Beatles (\\"Two Magpies\\"), or even bluesy and Zeppelinesque (\\"Highway,\\" my favorite track here).  \\"Lovers In A Dream\\" is a bit heavier on the programming and electronics, but it works and is always interesting.  Overall this is one for the ages, and shows how timeless electronic-tinged rock can be when the musician(s)/producer(s) respect each others' space and don't try too hard.<br /><br />As a closing thought, it's remarkable how committed Paul McCartney seems to music these days.  His last few releases have all been great, thoughtful works.  This one adds some edge to his sound.  He's even going to be playing Coachella this year, alongside young acts like TV On The Radio.  The man could easily be resting on his laurels by now, content with an already solid reputation.  However, he seems to legitimately love keeping his audience on its toes with a steady stream of new tricks tucked neatly up his well-worn sleeve.  I can't wait for his next one.ed in this project beyond McCartney, however I can say that the former Beatle has found a great musical partner (the producer Youth) who is able to tastefully integrate modern electronica into McCartney's world without disrupting the fundmental McCartney-ness of the music.

159448385X|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns  Khaled Hossein<br /><br />Thirty-three years of Afghanistan history is told through the story of two women of very different backgrounds and with a 20 year age difference.  It is the story of an exceptional friendship between Laila and Mariam.  But it is a history lesson also told over a 30 year span beginning with the Soviet occupation, then their withdrawal and the Mujahideen fighting between the various factions and in doing so, destroying Kabul.  This was followed by the Taliban take over of the country and the accompanying Shari'a  law.  And then after 9-11 Bush declares war on Afghanistan and arms the Mujahideen to drive out the Taliban and find bin Laden.  Thirty-three years of fear and terror, an entire generation of people who have never known anything else.  One can read the book as a novel and the story of two remarkable women or as a history lesson.
0240808452|5.0|When I got this book I was a bit skeptical of everyone's opinions of it as immense tool to the self taught. Upon receiving it and reading the first few chapters I saw that this book knew the mistakes I made when I drew and it explained not only why I made them but how I can avoid them as well. This book will cover things like feature exaggeration, shape, form and line function(and it will tell you why its a bad idea to have a million lines that do nothing). There is too much in this book to put in a review such as this one.     Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.

I've never read anything that wrapped up so perfectly, when, given what the author set up, it should not have.    all in all if you liked book 3, book 4 will be a fun ride, probably until the end.

031606792X|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!! This whole reveiw is a SPOLIER ALERT!!<br /><br />I had heard of twilight and i planned on reading this series before the movie came out. However plans don't always go the way you want. I ended up watching the movie first(i spoil my sisters too much)and then i read the books. Now i give every book five stars!!!I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! and I loved the saga overall!!! It has made my Most Liked Books List(and that's saying something) I think that people dont understand that when Meyer originally wrote these books (all of them) they were more for adults and her publisher's had her tone it down. Now obvioulsy she did not tone it down in \\"Eclipse\\" & \\"Breaking Dawn\\". I think that people are making a big deal out of this book, because they really are only looking at it from one view.<br /><br />First of all,<br />  The whole imprinting on the infant should NOT be taken out of context, Stephanie specified that when u imprint it is for what your needed for. If your needed as a big brother, friend, partner, etc. then thats what you will be. Which was the explanation for Quil imprinting on a two-year old. This is just a book and people seem to take this out of context of the facts. So all i can say to anyone who has a problem with the imprinting GET OVER IT!!!<br /><br />Secondly,<br />  Everyone thinks that her having a baby is not understandable. Yes, Bella was 18 when she had her daughter (A child that she thought was not possible) and she never saw her self as a mother due to that fact and because she knew that she could not have a child with the one person that she would have wanted to have one with. Her little nudger was a miracle in her eyes and all she saw was Edward's child. So of course she was going to go through with it.<br /><br />Lastly,<br />  Everyone wants to be critical saying that Bella got everything she wanted. I think anyone who has read these books and understood them knows that Bella may have recieved A LOT, but she never thought that what she was getting was possible nor did she expect it. So yes Bella did not have to go through what (they thought) normal vampires went through and yes she had a special ability. AGAIN saw it coming and so should you, it was made clear at the end of \\"New Moon\\" that Bella would have an ability and a very unique one at that. Now we get to Bella's happy ending (being a vampire, having Edward forever, Jacob as a friend & family, having an ability, having her father in her life,etc.) which she deserves after everything that happened not only to her, but her family (Jake,her parents, and the Cullens). Bella and Edward both received more than either of them expected, however people fail to realize that Bella will never be able to see her mom again, she will only be able talk to her, that to me is a sacrifice, she will loose her parents and friends in years to come seeing how she will never age (another sacrifice). Bella will have to continue to move and meet new people and loose them (for those who knows Bella her attatchments are hard to break from). Then the one thing that i believe is what will NEVER give Bella her happy ending is the Volturi. That is all i could think of at the end especially when Edward confirmed that they were NOT going to let that confrontation go. Which is not a happy ending if you think about it.<br /><br />Also i wanted to point out that it was made clear that Bella was not your average 17 year old from the start. She practically took care of her mom especially emotionaly, so to me this saga is meant for a much more mature audience. \\"Eclipse\\" & \\"Breaking Dawn\\" however seems to be meant for adults, because that is exactly what she is (really she's an adult in all of them) and like her mom said \\"But commitment was never your problem, sweetie\\". \\"My little middle-aged child. Luckily, you seem to have found another old soul.\\" I think its safe to say Bella has never really been your average teen.<br /><br />Just for clarification i don't really think this book sends a wrong message considering its for ADULTS (17 & up) and ITS NOT REAL!!!!!!! so anyone who is trying to sail that boat(i will never let my kids read this because its sends the wrong message boat)it just SANK.<br /><br />Again ITS NOT REAL!!!! (its all about imagination and being able to disconnect from the real world if just for a couple of hours. Everyone needs me time or down time thats what reading is about. Expand your imagination.) Besides its all about how you raise your child. They should be able to tell the difference between make believe and reality.its for ADULTS (17 & up) and ITS NOT REAL!!!!!!! so anyone who is trying to sail that boat(i will never let my kids read this because its sends the wrong message boat)it just SANK.

B001F1YBP8|3.0|This is essentially a DVD that has High Res Video Content but standard DVD-V quality audio content.  I have checked the packaging and the advertising content on Amazon after having purchased the disc and they are very coy about hiding this info.     The Video content is stunning and I second the comments previously made.     My dissapointment is that I bought it hoping to have High Res audio content.  As a DVD-V audio format it doesn't begin to compare sonically to several \\"Red Book\\" audio CDs that I own of the same music.     So if you like watching classical music in high def video but a low def audio eperience, this is for you.  I would have hoped for more truth in advertising.       I will be sticking with SACD as the prefered high res audio format for classical music.

0316017922|4.0|When we look at successful people, we tend to look more favorably upon those who achieved their success by their own means.  Politics aside, one knock against George W. Bush (fairly or unfairly) was that his successes were unearned and merely given by family connections.  The Obama story, on the other hand, was much more one of the self-made man.  As Malcolm Gladwell argues in Outliers, however, such successes often owe a lot more to luck than most people would like to acknowledge.    An early illustration in Gladwell's book demonstrates this:  in Canadian hockey, the best players are usually born in the first three months of the year.  This is because the cutoff date for determining age in children's hockey is January first; hence the kids born early in the year are slightly older, which in early years can make a big difference.  The successes in these early years push these kids into the better teams and give them access to more coaching, widening the differences.  It's not that talent doesn't come into play, but for two kids with equal amounts, the one born in January is going to have a big edge over the one born in December.    This is the gist of Outliers:  that innate ability isn't enough.  The accident of being in the right place at the right time is essential too.  It allowed the Beatles to become the biggest rock group ever and Bill Gates to shine with Microsoft.  If the circumstances don't work in your favor, your talents will not be used to their full potential.    Even the culture you're born into can make a difference.  Gladwell gives as an example the deferential nature in Asian cultures that can make questioning authority difficult; this can be disastrous in situations that require such questioning, as his tales of plane crashes indicate.  On the other hand, Gladwell also shows that these cultures have a stronger work ethic than their Occidental counterparts.  His point isn't that one culture is better or worse, but rather that these differences needto be acknowledged to both overcome failures and achieve successes.    As with Gladwell's other books, there isn't really much you can glean that will make your own efforts more successful; in fact, Outliers may be discouraging in its message that ability and hard work may not be enough to succeed.  Gladwell's stories are all retrospective:  he looks at examples of success (or failure) and then goes backward to see how they occurred.  This anecdotal aspect made me question whether Gladwell had truly hit on a pattern or merely selected some examples to fit his ideas.    Outliers is well-written and insightful, but my issues in the previous paragraph make me wonder if this is really a worthwhile book.  Overall, it probably is, but it should probably be taken with that proverbial grain of salt.

B000N6B5M8|5.0|I read several books about Lincoln and then turned to  reading this thick, well written and researched book concerning Lincoln and several of his life long friends, with the understanding that Obama had read the book and was using it as an outline for his office.  It was interesting to see what he did and why he did it; how he made decisions, his personal decisions, and stuck with them.  When ever he followed the dictates of his cabinet or other opinions, different than his own, he got into trouble.  Lincoln needed to listen to his own council.  It was sad to learn that Lincoln was the sole cause of the Civil War and all the money and lives it cost.  He was not assassinated soon enough.  His unconstitutional beliefs in the connection of the the States to that of the Union caused much trouble for everyone.
B00197X140|4.0|This reworking of many Anathema favorites is essential for any fan. Some may see a re-recording album it and think it is just filler for the record company to profit from, and to keep listeners attentive until the next album comes out, and with some other bands, that may sometimes be the case. Sometimes re-recording albums just make you want to go listen to the original. But not here: this is truly a treasure as much as other full albums.<br /><br />Several of these songs I really think are better than the original. \\"[[ASIN:B00013VHI0 Alternative 4]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0000AHEBK Eternity]]\\" were great albums, but the production quality wasn't too good. So, instantaneously, these songs at least demand attention from your ears, weather or not you think they are better than the originals. I think at least \\"Angelica\\" is a no-brainer; as when it was originally recorded, Vincent was still learning how to sing. I also happen to think the rework of \\"Inner Silence\\" is gorgeous, and this interpretation of \\"Fragile Dreams\\" is excellent as well, although is missing that magical essence from the original.<br /><br />\\"One Last Goodbye\\" I am on the fence with. The original was so emotionally powerful, and had powerful vocals to match the feeling. In acoustic mode, containing violins and pianos, the strong vocals would be too much, as they are much more subdued. This just feels too empty, musically, to be effective, but that's because I'm thinking of the original too much - perhaps I can get used to this.<br /><br />The song I think has improved the most is \\"Are you There?,\\" introducing a lovely, upbeat acoustic foundation instead of the terrible monotonous keyboards in the original. If I could, I'd go back in time and throw away the original and replace it with this, so I could have been listening to it for the past 5 years.<br /><br />\\"Flying\\" is much more elaborate and interesting than the original as well; the arrangement is much more layered and full sounding. It is also extended by a good 30 seconds with an addition to the buildup at the end even adding some tremolo playing with an Irish mandolin.<br /><br />\\"Temporary peace\\" is revisited under a new light by adding a violin; very nicely done.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"A Natural Disaster\\" sounds way too similar to the original; in fact, I can barely tell the difference.<br /><br />The new song at the end is decent; it has an interesting rhythm and makes use of violins, but is quite repetitive and extinguishes the freshness of itself rather quickly. Definitely not their strongest work but it is nice to have something new along with all the classics.<br /><br />So there we have it - a look back in hindsight on Anathema's career. Let's hope the next 18 years are just as good. Also, c'mon Anathema, release your next album already! I've been eagerly awaiting 6 years - it better be worth the wait!ition to the buildup at the end even adding some tremolo playing with an Irish mandolin.    \\"Temporary peace\\" is revisited under a new light by adding a violin; very nicely done.

B00002EPJH|5.0|This album, for me, is quite irresistible; I can very well imagine jazz fans who would never agree about an album fawning over the shear beauty of this CD... Jazz standards often motivate great players to reach their biggest creative peaks and, I believe, this is a fine example of that truth...<br /><br />On some other CDs I've heard Jarrett playing with more energy, but I'm not sure anyone, including him, can play more subtly than on this particular album.<br /><br />Since others have admirably described the restrained virtuosity of \\"The Melody at Night, With You\\", I'll stop and just recommend it to jazz fans of different persuasions...

B00007J5VN|5.0|Requested by my mother-in-law she absolutely loved the movie. The songs were outstanding as you would expect from most high class musicals. And last but not least the price and prompt delivery were very much appreciated.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|i have not been exposed to this type of music before and i find it to be very intriging. i recommend it to everyone. it will make you eclectic if you aren't already....and that's a good thing
B001M5UDGS|5.0|No, really.  Do yourself a favour and check it out.  Really, i mean it.  You will thank me for strong arming you.      Honestly.  Watch it, quit reading this and put it in your cart. You are wasting valuable time and i am saving you wasting more.     You will laugh, you will cry, you will wonder what kind of genius can have you enjoying a musical in the 21st century.      Watch it.
0375714839|5.0|A graphic novel that has a way of addressing some pretty heavy topics without weighing the reader down. Would recommend to all who want humor and politics within a coming-to-age story. Would also recommend the movie.
0783225482|5.0|I know this is old school and I am aging myself for everyone but this is hands down the best movie of our ( the new elderly) time.
B0016NF06O|5.0|Highly recommended. Willie has ALWAYS been a jazz artist dressed as a country singer and Wynton is one of the greats of our generation- keeping jazz alive. A MUST HAVE  for any collection!
B001IMFHVG|5.0|This is amazing - the most amazing dvd of piano performance I have  seen.  The sound is adequate, the video in poor black and white - but...it is magical.

0525951113|4.0|Michael A. Sobol PhD, CTO of Cyberstorm Entertainment, died at 34 of brain cancer.  He was the mastermind behind such online games as On The Rhine and The Gate.  Not long after his death, Cyberstorm programmer Joseph Pavlos dies a horrible death while riding his bike, then programmer Chopra Singh is electrocuted entering the server room.  Two deaths within hours of each other lead Detective Sergeant Pete Sebeck to believe they are homicides.<br /><br />Sebeck and the Thousand Oaks police force team up with the FBI, after computer contractor Jon Ross finds a rogue program running on the servers in Singh's network.  Converging on Sobol's house, they find a significant technological fortress, supposedly guarding the daemon program running amok across the internet.  Agent Roy \\"Tripwire\\" Merritt is injured in the destruction of Sobol's house, and many are killed including Sebeck's friend Agent Larson, when a driverless Hummer attacks the units set up outside the house.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Pete Sebeck is arrested for the deaths, the daemon is declared a hoax, and Sebeck winds out fast-tracked onto Death Row.  Jon Ross disappears, leaving no trace of his identity but stays in contact with Sebeck and the NSA.  Mix in some characters like Anji Anderson, an ex Lifestyles reporter who's deepest desire was to be a \\"real\\" journalist ... and the daemon gives her that wish.  Brian Gragg dabbled in illegal activities on the internet in between playing online games, and is recruited by the daemon to become a faction leader.  Doctor Natalie Phillips, assigned by the NSA to track down and eliminate the daemon, which they know exists but refuse to go public with it.<br /><br />Two factions emerge, those who follow the daemon, and those dedicated to stopping it.  Sobol was a genius, and appears throughout the book in pre-programmed messages.  His craftiness knows no boundaries.  Just what is the purpose of the daemon?  To change the world, but you'll have to read the book to find out what Sobol's master plan is.<br /><br />While well written, and fast paced (the book starts out with a bang and doesn't slow down) I believe it's written for a younger crowd.  Anyone who plays online games is going to immensely enjoy the way author Daniel Suarez has melded the real world to the cyber world.  There's a bit too much time wasted on characters playing characters in video games for my taste.  Not being a \\"gamer\\", I found these parts to be tedious.  Some of the writing borders on childish, such as Sebeck's little \\"slapping and cuffing\\" love bout with his mistress; reading more like a young man's wet dream that an actual physical bonding.<br /><br />I've seen reviewers compare Suarez to Michael Crichton, and I strongly disagree with that opinion.  While Suarez is good, he lacks Crichton's flare for realism - his ability to make you firmly believe the events could actually happen no matter how far fetched.  But rest assured, Suarez is just beginning, and 'Daemon' is wide open for a sequel that I will be sure to pick up when it comes out.  Don't miss out on this talented new writer and the dangerous cyberworld/fantasy world he's created.  Enjoy!plan is.

B001EN71CW|3.0|The show itself is one of the best sci-fi series I've seen in a long time.  The stories are engaging, the character development is great, and the actors appear to have really 'clicked' together.  I heartily recommend it.    Now the bad news... the blu-ray version is sub-par.  I own the series on both DVD and blu-ray, and was expecting the blu-ray to be a noticeable improvement.  It was not.  In fact, when I go back and compare the two, on some of the scenes the blu-ray actually looks worse than the DVD.      The biggest problems appear to be the darkly-lit character scenes.  On the DVD, they simply lack detail; on the Blu-ray version, they look grainy.    On the whole, I would recommend the DVD version over the blu-ray unless your goal is to own only blu-ray format.  The DVD version gets 5 stars from me; the blu-ray version, only 3.
0767903862|5.0|I bought this book to read while on vacation. I have to say this was the first book that I ever read and laughed until I had tears. I lived for a few years in South Australia and this book brought back great memories. I recalled my first few days in country and the experience. This book is light hearted and witty, just pure fun. The boogie board experience was hilarious.
B00114UUUY|5.0|This is a fun concert to watch.  Christina is so Beautiful to see and hear on stage.  This video DVD is the greatest show on earth.
B000LW7OWE|5.0|what can i say, a classic movie about a classic rock band on high def blue ray.....get it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Can I give this more than five stars?  Is that possible?  It's amazing.  I mean, I know it's free online, which is great in the first place, but the bonus content alone is worth the DVD.  Commentary: The Musical was hillarious, and I loved the ELE applications.   Eleven stars.
B0000549B0|5.0|I have always Loved this movie and my son was at our house and watched it with us for the first time. He loved it and said he would like to get it so I bought this for him as a Christmas gift. It's funny and sweet and has Jimmy Stewart so it is practically impossible not to love it. It makes me wish that everyone could be like Jimmy Stewart in this movie, what a wonderful world it would be!
B00009W0U4|4.0|...if only life were as subtle as Nina Perrson suggests;...Upon learning that his girlfriend Alex (Monica Bellucci) is raped and brutally beaten,  Marcus (Vincent Cassell)  and his friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel) are summoned by the local crime syndicate to seek revenge and find the thug who committed this heinous act.  To describe the vengeance that follows (or in this case, supersedes) would only drain the vocabulary of superlatives.  As the viewer is put through a series of what \\"could've been\\" . Such as Marcus testing Alex's patience with his reckless drug usage at a party that same evening, forcing her to leave early in disgust.  Or, even following her out the door after she leaves just to make sure she gets a cab ride home.  Pierre even hints at the dangers that lurk about outside as Alex is leaving and tells her to be careful.  If only Marcus and Pierre had put fourth more effort to try to defuse the situation.  If only Marcus had a real \\"friend\\" instead of his girlfriends ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />You're almost left with the impression that Pierre really doesn't have his friend's best interests in mind...I mean, what's Pierre's agenda in all this?  Could he really be considered a friend of Marcus given the circumstances involved (an ex-boyfriend who clearly wants Alex back)?  While Marcus almost being forced to react (by the local organized crime elements) without proper prosecution to avenge his own ridiculous behavior at the party.  The film unfolds with Marcus and Pierre being led out of a bar by police.  One in handcuffs, the other with a broken arm (ironic considering Marcus found the right guy at the bar but attacked the other guy he was standing with...just before Pierre saves the day with a fire extinguisher, or so he thought).  And ends with Alex reading a book underneath a bright blue sky.  She's alone with her thoughts, perhaps contemplating her approach to Marcus concerning her possible pregnancy. Or, was she thinking about Pierre (considering what she was reading)?  ...\\"I've changed my mind, I take it back, erase and rewind\\"...<br /><br />olofpalme63was reading)?  ...\\"I've changed my mind, I take it back, erase and rewind\\"...    olofpalme63
B000H5TVKI|5.0|In town, you're the law.....out here it's me....    Such a great line holy crap this movie is just great. Looks great on Blu-ray. Wasn't old enough to see this in the theater as I was only 5 when it came out...    So until blu-ray came along I've only seen it on VHS and TV broadcasts.     Recently got a 50\\" plasma, and I finally get to see this movie how it was meant to be seen. Looks incredible on blu-ray. Not the best mind you like dark knight or anything but very clear and crisp for a 27 year old movie!    for the price, get it on blu-ray and enjoy!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Absolutely awesome movie that everyone should see. Says a lot about mankind and is fun along the way. Check it out!
B0012IV3RS|3.0|The New York Ripper\\" is simply one of Lucio Fulci's best.The shocking mix of gritty police drama, kinky sex, and sheer terror is so carefully blended that there can be no doubt that Fulci was not merely a fine director, but a man who possessed nothing less than pure genius. Unless you are of a squeamish nature, this DVD is absolutely worth owning.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|The underlying biblical themes gives De Palma's movie a profound message.  For example, after Al Pacino's character Tony Montana bumps off the boss, having done a few other horrible acts, he sees a sign in the sky saying \\"the world is yours,\\" which cross references with the New Testament theme of satan offering Christ the world if He would serve him.  The only difference is, Tony Montana complied.  The theme of Tony Montana hating communists is good.  The theme of getting in deeper problems when he had a court hearing and his \\"friend\\" in Bolivia would help him out with American Congressmen he was friendly with, the subsequent act of potentially murdering little kids with Mr. Shickadance in the passenger seat, Tony Montana's revulsion about this mess, shows a human side to him.  His reflection in the restuarant about how the creeps in the world need people like him so they can have a scape goat \\"there's the bad guy.\\"  Tony Montana's death in the end with the sign again looming large \\"the world is yours\\" is quite profound.  This is certainly a worthy sequel to the Godfather.  Although, the use of f must been a result of the scriptwriter transporting his stress over the deadlines into the script.  Italians make pretty good Cubans.  Although, I have great misgivings about portraying my race in a negative light.  Yet, on the positive side, who can command a macho presence other than my fellow paisans?
B0012EM5D8|4.0|I ordered The Bee Movie for my grandson for his 7th birthday. one of his friends has the movie and he asked me to get it for him. He and his brother and sister watched it that night and they loved it. I was happy with the fast delivery and free shipping!
0525951113|4.0|Daemon starts off with a bang! It had me hooked and turning pages late into the night. Most unfortunately the end of the book does not deliver. The last third gets silly and the conclusion is well hardly a conclusion at all with almost every thread of the plot line left untied.  A very unsatisfying ending for such a promising beginning.  Revised 05/23/14  I have since read the 2nd half of the story, \\"Freedom\\" and upped by rating to 4 stars! In retrospect, I love this story and both books are great but neither is a complete story unto itself which is why I give it only 4 stars and not 5. I have read several of his newer books now and while okay these two are the best and will hopefully be made into a movie or TV series one day. Enjoy!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I love the cinema. I love movies and regularly go to the cinema and have loads of dvds. There are many fims over the years I have seen and loved and watch repeatedly but none more than this. This film has it all. Superb acting from the three main actors, Spielberg at his best and a score that defies belief and which has never been bettered. For all the movies I have seen and loved over the years, this is the only one I can remember everything about the day I first went to see it, Queueing around the block at the ABC in Liverpool and panicing as I thought i wasn't going to get in as the cinema was nearly full. Then the feelings during watching the film itself. This is the only film I have seen where the I can remember the audience all standing and cheering at the end when the shark is killed. So what if today the effects look poor. Modern film makers think that horror equals CGI. If you have good graphics, you can get away with anything. They should take note of how the suspense is built in this film despite the way its villain looks. An absolutely perfect film. Never bettered in my opinion.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is a great soundtrack...it's not full of over-played pop songs like many other soundtracks.  It's been in my CD player for over a month since I received it in the mail...highly recommend :)
B00164IV9G|4.0|It's not that often that you see a mainstream movie which draws groups of single women like moths to a flame.  Not surprising considering the movie's genesis from a phrase in one episode of Sex and the City, and the book of the same name.<br /><br />Not that this would necessarily make a great date movie. It's more of a go see with your friend movie.<br /><br />It boasts a promising ensemble cast with Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Ginnifer Goodwin, Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and others.<br /><br />As we go deeper into the movie, we get caught up in the familiar stories and situations of these characters.  The central theme characters are played by Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love) as Gigi, and Justin Long as Alex (Live Free or Die Hard,and the Mac Guy from the tv ads), the wise bar manager with the knowing male perspective, who knows the dating code, and can tell instantly when he's not into her, and when she's not into him.<br /><br />So he mentors Gigi, jilted and frustrated in love, a universal character most of us will recognise and perhaps empathise with. He even offers to set her up with his friend, but does Alex have feelings for her.<br /><br />In contrast Conor played by Kevin Connolly from Entourage, plays the guy looking for the right relationship, yet inexplicably gets put back in the friend zone by Scarlett Johansson's character, but can he get out of that zone?<br /><br />One of the biggest laughs comes when Jennifer Connelly's character breaks the mirror, and what happens next.<br /><br />Most insightful is the long term relationship between Jennifer Aniston's and Ben Affleck's character, seven years together. If a guy says he does not want to ever get married, do you stick with him and hope he will change, or do you move on?<br /><br />With Scarlett Johansson's slippery slope storyline, both sides of the story unfold, it does take two to tangle, and it is cautionary. Unfortunately, I have known a few restless guys like this guy.  It's not personal, it's just human nature.<br /><br />One lesson from the movie could be whether women read too much into minor actions.  He said 'It was nice meeting you,' but what does that mean?  Does it mean he's interested, or is it merely a brush off. As Freud said eventually: Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar..<br /><br />In contrast men do not pick up on minor signs, and so we tend not to give minor signs either. We tend to be obvious.  If a guy does not call, it means he's lost your number (it does happen), or maybe he doesn't feel he deserves you, or he's unavailable, which means he's just not that into you.<br /><br />On the other hand if we are interested, we operate in a vacuum, because we cannot read the signs. So, how do we know if they are really into us. Then there's the fine balance of how often, and when to call.<br /><br />If we don't conform to some preconceived idea of behavior this delicate flower of burgeoning attraction becomes overwatered and dies, or underwatered and shrivels. If we call and they don't call back, what does that mean?<br /><br />So, we men are really in the same boat, aren't we?<br /><br />I hope this is helpful.e lesson from the movie could be whether women read too much into minor actions.

B001KMB6VE|1.0|This movie was horrible and the action was nonexistant. Vin is usually worth watching but not here.  Don't bother!!!
630522885X|4.0|Yesterday night I saw the restored version of Lola Montes in the cinema theatre in Gent, Belgium. The visual spectacle certainly deserves a big screen viewing. So if you get the chance go out and see it the way its makers wanted you to see it. Amazing that the colours still bounch off the screen. An entertaining movie and story.
B0006J28KU|4.0|I can't believe it took me this long to watch this film. Last week, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine. We were discussing the history of the Warner Brothers Cops and Robbers films. He mentioned that 'Heat' really innovated and changed the genre in the mid-90's. He spoke so highly of the film that I went out and rented a copy at my local video store.<br /><br />I was pretty blown away. I mean, forget all the Pacino meets DeNiro hype, the two characters are just well-drawn and morally complex (especially the DeNiro character). When I begin to root for both the cop and the robber, I know I've found a compelling story - that's exactly what 'Heat' is, compelling. Funny when I think of it now, but I can totally see parallels with Chris Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' (although 'Heat' is way more polished)and can't help but think that 'Heat' was used as a basic format of sorts for Nolan's film (not to discredit that film, I just find it interesting).<br /><br />Not to mention how great the action scenes are, tense, bloody, surprising and LOUD! Each set piece is perfectly timed, never feeling forced or unnecessary. And it's exciting, the violence feels real and undiluted (sometimes to a scary degree, i.e. the photo of the hooker in the trash can, sans bashed skull). The action perfectly fits with the drama of the story, though, and the extremity of the violence serves to add to the immediacy of the character dilemmas as well.<br /><br />From what I've seen of Michael Mann's work (Manhunter, Collateral, Miami Vice), this is certainly his Magnum Opus (although you could make an argument for Last of the Mohicans or The Insider). A sprawling modern epic crime story riddled with interesting characters and first rate action? Count me in....<br /><br />4 and 1/2 Stars.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Outstanding picture quality and tons of extras. This is definitely for the fans. It comes with digital copies, which is very nice.
6305428050|5.0|This has been my all time favorite movie and I've been wanting to get it on DVD. Well after looking at all the video stores my mom mentioned to look for it on Amazon.com and sure enough they had it! I love this movie!
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|It was a pretty cool movie. Not what I was expecting. Lot of action and suspense. I really enjoyed watching the movie.
B001BZF9UY|4.0|I like Hans Zimmer a lot.  I have a few of his albums, listen to him quite a bit while I'm coding, and put him in my top 3 favorite composers (after Yoko Kanno certainly, and Nobuo Uematsu perhaps).  I don't own any albums by James Newton-Howard, but I've enjoyed what I've heard of his music.<br /><br />I remember listening to a few songs on last.fm or somesuch when the movie came out, and didn't feel particularly impressed.  When I watched the movie, as I was walking out of the theater, I thought \\"Oh yeah, I was supposed to listen to the music.\\".  That said, I like the composers and the movies, so I bought the album, and was, well, still unimpressed.  It's good, certainly, but it could have been much better.  Among Zimmer's work, I'd rate this a 3-star, but among music in general, it gets 4 stars.  Perhaps not the album to get if you're looking at expanding your Zimmer collection, but still worth the $9 download.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Bad, bad, and bad.  Even for Ben Stiller this goes too far.  I saw the theater version, I can honestly say that I don't think I could take five more minutes of this movie.  Gross out humor goes too far.. blood, guts, sex acts.  Downey Jr does a decent job.  Rent first or look in your local thrift store bins in 6 months.
0195073401|1.0|The authors of this book have the ability to make even the easy concepts seem very hard. The notations used in this book are awful and it takes more time to understand the notations than to understand the concepts.
B001POAVZE|5.0|It's a very groovy release, full of really catchy and danceable tracks.  Even more so than their last offering.  I wouldn't pay attention to any review that gave this album less than 4 stars :)
B0013FSL3E|3.0|How is this $14.99 a 'warehouse deal'?  I can get this DVD at at he local WalMart for the same price minus the shipping.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|\\"Peter's Friends\\" is the British \\"Big Chill.\\" And while it may be a stretch to see yourself among this ensemble of Brits gathering to celebrate New Year's Eve in a castle, you can relate to their dilemma; in a way, growing up sucks. But the warmth of their friendship, the obvious bond of the actors and a great script and stellar soundtrack will put this one on the top of your favorites list. And if you're just discovering Hugh Laurie (\\"House\\"), this shows you a completely different side of him.
B001NE80P4|5.0|My daughter and I have enjoyed the HSM series, and this one was our favorite.  It is an uncomplicated, fun filled musical, and if you connected with the characters, you laughed out loud and maybe even shed a goodbye tear with the Seniors. I hope the HSMs to come can carry on this feel good tradition.
0762412992|4.0|The book is excellently done and illustrated.  However, there was no indication that it is abridged and that disappointed me very much.  It could be a good introduction to Dickens for younger children.

B001C08RHA|5.0|I personally have never liked Downing, but he was quite good in this movie. Some of the Marvel Comics do make up into a good action movie. This one was no exception. All of the other players were also good in their parts.

B001MW0J2O|5.0|I still haven't listened to any pre-Strawberry Jam Collective to know what they really sounded like, but they seem here to have fully committed to their transition from experimental rock to some sort of psychedelic electro-pop madness, without a single guitar to be heard. It can be a bit bizarre, but starting from the explosion of noise halfway through the opening track \\"In the Flowers\\", it's easy to see that music doesn't have to be familiar to be extremely infectious and fun to listen to. I'm still not very good at telling Avey Tare and Panda Bear apart, besides the fact that Avey is the one singing when the singing's crazy. The two seem to have a tighter interplay here than they did on the last album, and overall it's a more consistently enjoyable and focused effort. More of the songs feel like fully-formed pop with actual structures, even if the different elements seem unusual. The single \\"My Girls\\" is the perfect example of this, and pretty frighteningly catchy.    Not every song is like that, with some being more firmly in the band's esoteric oeuvre, although you can pretty much expect electronic twiddling and driving bass on most of them. \\"Also Frightened\\" is as close as the album gets to boring, although there are enough interesting touches to keep your attention. \\"Summertime Clothes\\" is poppy fun and a good distillation of the essence of what they seem to be going for.  \\"Daily Routine\\" reminds me the most of their last album, with dissonant beeps providing the core instrumentation, echoing vocals, and the drawn out, starkly unique second half.  \\"Bluish\\" might be the closest I've seen them come to a love song, although it kind of has their sort of twist on it.  \\"Guys Eyes\\" does an interesting thing with the vocals that I'm not sure totally works, but it's worth hearing.  \\"No More Runnin\\" is another slower track, and a solid lead in to \\"Brother Sport\\", the final song and of the catchier ones.  It's not without some off-putting bits, but the vocals and frequent explosions of musical happiness cap off a very good album quite nicely.  I'm sure it's not done growing on me yet, and is a great way to start off a new year musically.
006135323X|4.0|This book is fairly interesting.  At first I found it much better than Freakanomics.  I thought the author pompous for saying on the first page of the book that the book will change your life.  However, he made some really good points that may in fact make people consider their relationship with money, prices and spending habits differently.  However, we all know if self help books (which this is not) helped people improve their lives so very much that book segment would dry up.  Mostly they help us understand why we do the things we do and understand some of them are silly or counterproductive.  If we are lucky this might be helpful, but mostly it is interesting and informative.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love the cinematography in this collection.  At this point I'm near the 2,000th reviewer for it, so all I feel I can add is that if you are tired of the constant stream of propaganda on cable programming today (which I hear is 5x worse now than it was even just 3 months ago), but you enjoy watching the Discovery Channel & nature programs, etc. you could get by with cancelling your cable and just buying this instead, renting movies, etc.  You'll likely be better off if you did, and this collection is a great place to start your own chosen programming.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I still remember sitting in a theater and seeing a preview for this movie the very first time -- my anticipation for a movie had never been piqued with the same frequency - in fact, I was unable to focus on the subsequent movie because I started looking forward to Branagh's Hamlet.    I saw this in the theater a couple of times (one of the very few movies I have ever seen multiple times in the theater).    When I got a DVD player, I wanted to add this to my collection, but I had to wait for many years.  I even added this movie to the Contact me when it became available and I am so pleased that it finally came out.    The good thing about waiting is that now I have a large screen, high definition TV that is much better suited for watching this fantastic production.  So the wait was worth it.
159448385X|4.0|I read this book before I read Kite Runner his first book.  Do we call these kinds of books novels?  I have not read fiction for years as all of my reading has been technical books.  Years ago I did read good fiction novels but they seemed to have a better structure.  His writing about Afghanstan helped me to understand the country better and espcially how poorly women are treated.  I have read news stories on some of Taliban horror but this book brought so much of it into focus.    That said, and here it is hard to take the American out of America and to such a desolate land as described in the book for women, I would have bashed the husband in the head probably on day 2, not after 20+ years of torture and abuse.  This part of the Taliban and that part of the world and their treatment of women is so foreign it almost makes the book unbelivable to an American woman.  Yet I know that much of what he wrote is true.  If nothing else I came away with a sigh of relief that I was not born there.  I hope that what we are planning to do in this country is not Russia second part, the war lords part three, or Taliban part 4.    I read an article in the paper today about some National Guardsmen from Texas that are trying to grow wheat at 10,000 feet.  The Hazara were able to do this in the northern part of the country.  This is a peacful way to defeat the Taliban that control most of the grain grown in Afghanstan, probably most of the heroin as well, Ala willing.  This is the way to give these people back their lives, not with guns but with bread, the staff of life.      Why do I feel I need to make a political statement in a book review?  I think Hosseini is writing these books to help Americans with very limited attention spans and the need for thrills and chills, blood and gore in all their real entertainment to understand what Afghanistan is today.  Read both of his books but suspend your need to see this as great fiction.  This is one man's hope to get the message out tothe world the dire need for help in this part of the world.
B000683VI4|5.0|one of the best romance, relationship, films out there. seeing it once is not enough!!  i feel monthly would be a good idea.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie based on the real events of Anneliese Michel is very good.  I consider it a classic on the subject and think that she should be Sainted.  If you enjoy this film I recommend watching the commentary (special features) with it as well, as some interesting things happened to the crew while filming the movie.  Those who are interested in this subject are recommended to read Hostage to the Devil by Malachi Martin, who I also think should be Sainted.  5 out of 5.

B001HBX8NC|5.0|This is a fine recording of this opera.  The Blu-ray allows near theater levels of lighting -- night appears like night.  The video direction was solid -- the camera movements and cuts did not detract from the flow of the opera.  I do not know music well enough to comment on the technical quality of the singing -- but all of the performances were satisfying.  The conductor, Nello Santi, conducted from memory  The sound was great -- good dynamic and frequency range.  I saw this DVD on a 53 inch sony sxrd rear projection television in subdued light.  It was an excellent experience.
B0007TKH66|4.0|Star Trek Enterprise is a decent show, one I would recommend to anyone who is interested in space sci-fi.  The show deals more with exploration and discovery than any other star trek show before it.  This is due mainly to the fact that this is the first ship to be able to explore.  The pilot is a great episode that does a great job showing how ignorant humans can be in new cultures.  The acting is strong, if not a little over-acted at times, mostly by the guy who plays Mayweather, even Scott Bakula can overact a bit, but this is rare.  Jolene Blalock plays a great science officer and her facial responses to some of the crews actions are classic.  Although she sometimes tries to act so emotionless that she almost seems high.    The doctor and engineer provide some great comic relief as well as being very strong characters.  The tactical officer I could care less about, he's not really that interesting and needs a strong character around him to really shine (usually the chief engineer).  The chemistry between Tucker, T'Pol, and Archer is solid and it is really easy to believe that they have distinct relationships with each other. Archer and T'Pol have probably the most entertaining relationship, they are always at odds over Vulcan logic and Human emotion, yet there characters have a tremendous respect and appreciation for one another.  Overall a very good show for sci-fi fans, although it does have its moments of predictablity and gags that you can see a mile away.  Sometimes these gags are stupid, sometimes funny, and sometimes memorable.  I remember in one of the earlier episodes where they are all camping on the first class M planet they find while Mayweather is telling Ghost Stories.  Situations where the Human Condition can really shine is paramount to this series and I think that it accomplishes that very well.

B000PC0U1W|5.0|This movie is already a masterpiece and watching it in full high-definition just makes everything better.  If you enjoy this movie, I would recommend that you get it on blu-ray.
044022425X|4.0|I found this book the most fascinating of the series so far.  As a descendant of North Carolina Highlander Scots, I felt that the book gave me real insight into what my ancestors' lives may have been like as they settled the area, interacting with the Native Americans, and establishing a new nation.  I could never before understand why they stayed in rural NC for over 200 years on their land.  The story is very dramatic, fantastic and magical.  I'd waited six months to read this one, but I won't wait very long to read the next one.  Drums definitely made it well worth working through the thousands of pages of the first three books to get to it.  Wonderful things happen.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I'm being a little funny with my review title (in reference to the surfer lingo) but the fact is, this is one of the best gay-themed films out there. Many of the positive reviews put out here are right on the mark. I'm not sure I can add much to them except to say that this movie seems REAL. Ok, so it may be somewhat predictable, but this is how people talk and act and how life turns out sometimes. The cool thing about it is that it is definitely uplifting. The chemistry between the lead guys is amazing.      Some of the criticisms in here are much too nitpicky. I mean, how do we know that Zach didn't park his car a few blocks away from Shaun and Gabe's house when he went to see Shaun again (thinking that Gabe could show up anytime). This isn't a detective story, where you try to figure out everything that happens that is not shown on film! And I personally didn't understand Zach's artwork, but so what? That was his passion. And someone wrote about a 'scholarship for an child'??  Did they see the same movie?! Not even in the plot!      This is one definitely to watch, and I can pretty much guarantee that if you see it once, you'll want to see it over and over. More films of this nature need to be made.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I've been a Springsteen fanatic for 30 years.  This volume is pretty good.  What I've found is that the songs usually grow on me over time.  I had the same opinion of Magic at first and now I really like it.  Seems after you see him sing the songs in concert they take on better review.  I like the title song as well as a couple other tracks such as Outlaw Pete and Queen of the Supermarket.

B000ZN802W|5.0|I viewed this film last night and it is fresh in my mind. I thought about it a bit, read some other reviews good and bad. (This is my first Amazon movie review)... I did not read the book and knew nothing of this story till the movie opened in 2007. Finally got a copy and settled in. It moved me. Like many I'm sure, I couldnt fathom the intensity of Chris McCandless's pursuit of self reliance? or solitude? escape? what? Who knows what makes us all tick... What Sean Penn did was to take it to your solar plexus like a hard right. I am amazed when I ever watch a film or TV show and get emotionally involved. It happened this time. I felt a few hairs standing at the end, watching this man-child waste away. It was similar to stripping the gears on your car. A sound that tends to sicken. What a waste of a life, and yet it seemed to be the natural ending of a troubled soul. I'll see it again thats for sure.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|\\"Hellboy II\\" is an entertaining sequel that has even better make-up, costumes and special effects than the first movie.  The Hellboy movies seem a little deeper than most comic book movies in that they always show how human the main characters are despite the fact that they are \\"freaks.\\"  Of course, there is more of Hellboy's surly but endearing personality in this movie as well.  Ron Perlman seems to have this character down pat and I am eagerly looking forward to the next installment of the Hellboy series.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really liked this workout video.  It is very challenging and makes you sweat!  The only drawback is that there is only one workout per level.  I think the video would be better if there were a couple different workouts per levels, but still this is a great video to do at home.  I do the video on the days that I don't go to the gym and it is a nice addition to my workout.
B000002KDS|5.0|I managed to come across this album in NY at a local Best Buy, a very rare find. Thank God this worked. This is probably the 2nd or 3rd best Alice Cooper Band album. 1st naturally goes to \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" Killer is a really fun album. Everything is crisp and clear, ad the music flows smoothly track by track. Much like \\"Secret Treaties\\" by Blue Oyster Cult. I can't find one bad song on it. My favorite though is Dead Babies. I'd like to find an original version of that calendar. That's a damn good piece of memorabilia.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have watched the series 3 times on DVD and once on cable. I own both the DVD and BD versions. You can read 100+ reviews exalting the story, camera work, acting and production. I won't repeat any of it. If you are planning to buy it, just do it and be comforted by the fact that this will be the only purchase you'll ever make that you would gladly pay for twice.  Enjoy it.....and hug a veteran. We're losing them everyday

B0012GN3AU|5.0|Well, it is. If you follow this album, steal wasn't the word to use. This is the start of Alice's Christian Trilogy. It goes \\"The Last Temptation\\" \\"Brutal Planet\\" and \\"Dragontown\\"-the worst place on Brutal Planet. This album was all about finding a new path, putting down your personal demons, and...well you get the idea. Anyways, this is a necessary album in a collection. Very entertaining, good lyrics, and music. I like the whole album, but my personal favortie is \\"Nothing's Free\\"

031606792X|5.0|Personally, I read all 4 books within days, reading non-stop for hours on end, including the last one, Breaking Dawn.<br />It seems some reviewers and wanna-be critics are down on it because in the end, everyone gets what they want and it all works out well to alls advantage.<br />Well, isn't that what romantic happy-endings are all about?<br />What ever happened to those kind of stories? Why must there be regret and tragedy to end the note on or to make it more interesting?<br />I think Stephenie wrapped it up well, and moved on to the story of Rennesme very well. No, it's not written in a Jane Austen classic way of story-telling, but it's well-done all on it's own.<br />So all of those wanna-be critics should just STFU, and take it for what it is - a saga with a last book that actually had a happy ending.<br />It wasn't all that long ago that happy endings were the constant in literary books. It's good to see it back again.
000231746X|4.0|Elinor Carlisle, a sensible, well educated young woman, and her distant cousin, Roddy Welman, a somewhat less well focused amiable gentleman - perhaps even a bit of a dandy - are happily engaged. They both know they are living somewhat beyond their means but they take comfort in their expectation of the inheritance of a very sizable fortune from their elderly aunt, Laura Welman. When they receive an anonymous mean-spirited letter suggesting that someone is cozying up to their aunt and worming their way into her affections, Elinor suspects young Mary Gerrard, her aunt's lodge-keeper's daughter. Rationalizing with one another that they really ought to be making a greater effort to see their aunt more frequently, Elinor and Roddy quickly pack up for a visit to Mrs Welman with a concerned view to protecting their interests in the estate.<br /><br />During the course of their visit, when Roddy's head is turned by Mary Gerrard's stunning good looks and he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her, Elinor breaks off their engagement. When Mary Gerrard is murdered by the administration of a fatal dose of morphine in a sandwich and, shortly afterward, Aunt Laura dies intestate leaving Elinor as the sole heir of the entire estate by virtue of being the only surviving blood relative, Elinor quickly finds herself in the dock for Mary's murder. As the only suspect with both the means and the motive to dispose of Mary Gerrard, her conviction is all but certain.<br /><br />But \\"Sad Cypress\\" is a complex mystery with many motivational twists and turns. Roddy Welman's head wasn't the only head turned with new found love. Peter Lord, the Welman's family physician, has fallen behind over tea kettle into love with Elinor Carlisle. When she is arrested, although even he is uncertain as to her guilt, he retains Hercule Poirot and charges him with finding the evidence to acquit her at any cost.<br /><br />\\"Sad Cypress\\", a subtle, complex purely character driven mystery told virtually entirely through the device of dialogue, has an interesting three part structure. In the first part, told from Elinor Carlisle's perspective, we see the background of the entire story up to Mary Gerrard's murder. In the second part, we are witness to Poirot's subtle probing and investigation of the murder and, in the final third section, we sit in court as witness to Elinor's trial and prosecution for the murder. In a marvelous twist on the cozy mystery's usual climactic drawing room confrontation with all of the suspects, Poirot's findings are revealed to the reader by Elinor's defense lawyer during the proceedings of her trial.<br /><br />While \\"Sad Cypress\\" is a marvelously entertaining mystery, I'm unwilling to accord it a full five star rating because I believe it violates what I always felt to be an unwritten set of rules governing the genre. The mystery in \\"Sad Cypress\\" is simply not solvable by an astute reader no matter how carefully one might read the story. Ultimately, the mystery is solved and revealed by virtue of information to which only Poirot is privy. The superb surprise ending is no less entertaining as a result but one does feel a little cheated.<br /><br />On a historical note, I was interested to discover that this was Agatha Christie's first use of the courtroom setting in a Poirot mystery.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissdialogue, has an interesting three part structure.

B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|The movie itself is really good and I have found the entire series very interesting an d the reason I give five stars its because having both standard and high definition versions of the film in one disc is a very good bonus. Good movie and value.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|It was a present for my daughter, but the whole family got such a kick out of the movie, we've watched it numerous times.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|I love Cary Grant and most of his films, and this is one of my favorites.  He is a retired jewel thief but no one believes him.  He has to prove he isn't the cat burgler and help the insurance company find the real jewel thief.  In helping to prove his innocence he falls in love with Grace Kelly.  They are so good together and you really believe they love each other.  If you haven't seen this movie, please pop some corn, get your favorite drink, a nice blanket to wrap up in and turn off the phone.  You won't be sorry!
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I've owned this monitor stand for about a month, and I'm using it to hold up my [[ASIN:B000QSMCDY Westinghouse L2410NM 24-inch Widescreen LCD Monitor (Black)]]. Before buying, I was a little worried about whether it'd be able to hold up the weight of my monitor, because the product description says 22\\" is the maximum supported size. I decided to go for it after I saw the weight rating on Ergotron's website: 18 lbs, just enough to support my 16.3 lbs monitor.    While I've found the stand IS capable of holding up my monitor, I can tell it's close to the limit of what it can handle.    The construction is very solid. For example, the arms appear to be made of solid steel, making it fairly hefty.    While there was very little assembly, the process itself was a bit awkward because of the weight of the monitor. This is one area where better design might have helped. My guess is that Ergotron went with a simpler design to reduce cost (this is one of the cheapest models).    Another trade off Ergotron seems to have made involves the \\"head\\" which allows you to adjust the angle of your monitor. The problem with this part is that friction is the only thing keeping it in place. For heavier monitors, this means keeping the bolts tight, which makes it harder to adjust. This may be less of a problem for lighter monitors, but it definitely limits what I can do with this stand.    I think if you're looking for flexibility, you've got a larger monitor, and you're willing to spend a bit more, I recommend you look elsewhere. Otherwise, you're getting a good price on a well-built product that does exactly what you think it does.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I was very impressed with the CD, I wasn't expecting the DVD so that was a bonus. The price was good and the delivery time frame was great.  As I live in very rural Yukon, this type of shopping was easy and very convenient and will buy more products here in the future.
9562910881|5.0|This book is one of those rare books that has the potential to be life altering for the reader. The author was undoubtedly in communion with a higher power as it was written. Read it with an open mind and the possibilities for self improvement are unlimited. Highly recommended!
B00030590I|3.0|The good:  Beautiful cinematography, interesting plot, good acting.    The bad:  This movie is way too stylized.  Too much slow motion and special effects.  The fight scenes are so scripted they look like ballet, not fights.  And the last time I checked, humans can't fly.    If you can totally check your disbelief at the door, you might love this movie.  Even though this movie has some major positives, I prefer films that are believable.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like to use this workout on the days that I don't want to go to the gym or the park for an 1 hr workout.  It's a tough enough workout packed into 20 minutes.  It works for me on my \\"lazy\\" days....I tell myself \\"for 20 minutes I can force myself\\".  It also adds variety for me from my other choices for exercise. Works out the whole body.      It is annoying that you cannot skip the intro sections of the tape...won't fast forward in certain parts of the tape.
B00005U2JL|2.0|Casual fans of Marilyn Manson, ie those fans that mainly love Marilyn Manson because of \\"The Beautiful People\\", for example, may be disapointed with this DVD outing. Unless you have several of Marilyn Manson's CDs, and, have listend to them many, many, times, and, know the words to the songs... you will not know what he's singing most of the time in this DVD. The live setting may be great for theatrics, but you better know the words to the song beforehand, as you not likely learn them be watching this concert DVD.<br /><br />There are several things that I found distracting, due to my personal tastes in a music concert presentation.<br /><br />1. Although the songs are presented in sequence, with no break-aways to any non-concert activities, footage from different gigs are presented --within-- each song.<br /><br />2. The way the concert film was edited, it only allows just a very few seconds on any one shot, before changing to another shot, for just another few seconds, and then onto another shot for a few more seconds. This \\"MTV\\" style of video presentation does not give one the feel of what it was like to be at the show, except for what you can get in those 1-3 second shots. Short editing is good for some effect, but I think not, for an entire concert...<br /><br />3. The DVD's use of blurred blocks over some fans eyes, and, some other fans breasts, was cheesy. It made me think I was watching a 'Jerry Springer' show...<br /><br />4. If you like crotch-grabbing, then you will not be disapointed with this film, as their is an overabundance of it, all through the entire show.<br /><br />I am a casual fan of Marilyn Manson, and I will stick to listening to the selection of Marilyn Manson songs that I like, and I will watch videos of them on You Tube. I will not be watching this DVD again.
0743420373|2.0|Save yourself a few bucks and about a hundred pages of reading and get a cheap paperback copy of The Richest Man in Babylon instead.      The Millionaire Next Door encourages using thrift and planning to accumulate wealth.  This is a good thing, and I highly recommend everyone read at least one book showing you that it is possible to have financial security with just a little bit of planning.  I just believe it's been done better elsewhere.

B000I9TY4G|5.0|This movie has many fun twists and turns, great action in space and on the ground. It has back stories for elements of the show like reavers and why the Alliance was after River. The visuals are spectacular as well.    We can wish the show would come back, but they quit while they were ahead and blew our minds with a fabulous finale.

1592332803|5.0|This is an amazing book...with many descriptions and clear instructions, with incredible results. I've tested several recipes (classic current scones, ginger muffins, hot chocolate, cinnamon coffee cake...) and they have all turned out absolutely wonderful. The ONLY scone I have ever even liked was from this book...and I loved it!    Like many other reviewers, one of my favorite parts of this book is the detailed and descriptive substitutions and suggestions for replacing 'standard' animal products (i.e. eggs, milk, buttermilk, butter). Even after being vegan for almost two years, I still had not encountered good substitutions for condensed milk or other animal products not already made by a company or easily available. And this is not a book that tries to shove veganism down your throat...the author merely presents an argument for healthier options without sacrificing flavor.    I will continue to use this book for many, many years...with the approval of my husband and omnivore family. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a little creativity in their baking, those who want healthier options, or those looking for new remarkable and delectable recipes.

0375826726|3.0|Christopher Paolini, Brisingr (Knopf, 2008)<br /><br />I don't think it counts as a spoiler to say right off the bat that the most unsatisfying thing--by far--about Brisingr is the fact that what was originally supposed to be a trilogy has now grown into a four (at least) book series; if you were waiting for this under the impression that all would be resolved at the end, you'll have to wait longer. I rush to add that that's not entirely a bad thing, as Paolini's world is quite a fine one, and it's not at all frustrating to look forward to another five hundred or so pages of Eragon, Saphira, and their friends and compatriots.<br /><br />Brisingr opens with the resolution of one of the many plot threads left open at the end of Eldest; Eragon, Saphira, and Roran are off to rescue Katrina, Roran's fianc&eacute;e. This extended opening scene is the kickoff for most of the vents that occur in the book, which actually doesn't advance the series' main storyline a great deal; at the end of the book, the war against Glabatorix is in pretty much the same state as it was in the beginning. This is a book of character, much as Eldest was; Roran's storyline continues on, and he becomes a main character in his own right, while Eragon and Saphira continue working on honing their skills. Meanwhile, the dwarves have to choose a new ruler, and Eragon and Saphira have to head back to Farthen Dur, being honorary dwarves themselves.<br /><br />Because this is a character novel as opposed to a plot novel, those who considered Eldest to be a weaker book than Eragon will probably have the same problem with Brisingr. I was of the opinion that Eldest was actually a somewhat better book than Eragon, and my opinion continues in this book. Paolini's writing skills are a pretty obvious parallel to Eragon's martial skills, and if Paolini actually planned it out this way consciously, then I'm even more impressed. (I imagine it's a subconscious thing, however.) That said, I did expect there to be a good deal more advancement of the main plot; Eldest may have been a long diversion, but while Eragon and Saphira were off getting themselves trained in the woods, the war was still raging outside, and lots of stuff happened. Here, it feels as if the timeline has gone off the rails rather than it being a case of Galbatorix sitting and biding his time. (After all, the events in the first scene really kind of beg retaliation from the other side--retaliation that is offered the barest of lip service here.) So while it's unarguable that Paolini is improving as a writer, I'm not sure he's improving as a plotter. We'll have to wait for book four to find out. ***the main plot; Eldest may have been a long diversion, but while Eragon and Saphira were off getting themselves trained in the woods, the war was still raging outside, and lots of stuff happened.

The singing (especially that of Juan Diego Fiorez and Maria Bayo) is topnotch all the way through and the musical direction under Gianluigi Gelmetti leaves nothing to be desired. For me, the stunning picture and DTS Master Audio sound track make this one of the best high-definition discs I have bought to date. The camera work is exemplary and ranks among the best to date as far as an opera is concerned -- it ranks with that of the English video director, Brian Large, one of the best in the world for many years.  I have two minor criticisms however - one concerns the staging and the other, the English subtitles. The staging is a little bizarre at times and tends to create confusion for the viewer and also distracts from what is happening on stage. In one scene in particular the entire stage rises, revealing more chorus on the lower level - this, I feel, is one of the few mismanaged scenes in the production. Regarding the subtitles, they become practically impossible to read in many spots, especially when they are overlaid on a light as opposed to a dark scene. The subtitles definitely need to be adjusted for much greater readability.
0060273224|3.0|Garth Nix, Sabriel (Eos, 1995)<br /><br />I've had Sabriel sitting on my shelf for years waiting for me to read it; I started it once, about five years ago, and was so turned off by the prologue I put it right back on that shelf and pretty much forgot about it. I dragged it out again recently, determined to make it past the prologue thanks to all the raves it's gotten, and gave it another go. The prologue is just as confusing as I remembered (and unlike the mercifully short prologue in Twilight, it seems to go on forever), but once I got into the book, it was certainly an improvement.<br /><br />Sabriel, the title character, is a fourteen-year-old girl who has spent the majority of her life at a boarding school in Ancelstierre, a country to the south of her birthplace, the Old Kingdom. (The parallel here is with England and Scotland; Ancelstierre reminds one of early twentieth-century England, but with magic. And why is it, I ask, that alternate-universe Scotland is always portrayed as wild, untamed, and more than a little evil by fantasy writers [cf. George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire]? As a Scot, I heartily protest!) As the novel opens, Sabriel learns of her father Abhorsen's disappearance when his sword and bells are sent to her at school; she must journey home to the Old Country to find out what's become of him. Thus begins the usual fantastic (in the sense of \\"fantasy\\") quest; Sabriel finds herself gathering a team of sidekicks with various powers to complement her own, though she is unaware of the full range of her powers at the beginning of the book (as is so often the cases in these sorts of novels). She also finds out that Abhorsen is not her father's name, as she had always thought, but a title roughly analogous to Grand Wizard; the Abhorsen is the only person in the kingdom licensed to use necromancy along with the more sanctioned forms of magic. She's been taught nothing about necromancy, however, and with her father gone, she'll have to figure out how to use it on her own. After all, if her father is truly dead, necromancy will certainly come in handy in proving that.<br /><br />There's a great deal more to this, but I'm not sure how much I can say without getting well into spoiler territory. Having now finished the thing, I can't say I was as worked up about it as most of its devotees seemed to be, but it was a great deal better than I had expected, and I'll be continuing on with the series. While a lot of the trapping to be found here are well-worn clich&eacute;s in the fantasy genre, Sabriel herself is quite a character, and her first sidekick, Mogget, is one of the more intriguing creatures I've encountered in a fantasy novel recently outside the work of Steven Erikson. I'm hoping the other two books in the trilogy improve (this was, after all, Nix's first novel, and I'm usually willing to give a first-time novelist more leeway than I normally would), and expect I'll enjoy finding out. ***r own.

B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson's epic film \\"Braveheart\\" won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture & Best Director. The film earned those Oscars because it was done so well: the mammoth scope of the events in history, as well as the historical figures (however little may be the material that we know about their lives) demanded a sprawling budget and a running time reminiscent of epic movies like \\"Ben-Hur,\\" \\"Sparatacus,\\" \\"Doctor Zhivago,\\" etc. Like \\"Spartacus\\" and, more recently, \\"Valkyrie,\\" this film has a strong message of standing up for what you believe, even in the face of certain death, but \\"They'll remember you.\\" Wallace fought and died for what he believed in.On 22 July 1706 the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England and the following year twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from 1 May 1707 (source:[...]). Take heed of the film's R rating, though: The violence is brutal and intense, which is absolutely neccessary for a story like this. FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DFZZC|5.0|One of my all time favorites. This is a great American story that transcends any interest in horse racing. Narrated in a simple straightforward manner as if you were hearing it from a neighbor who was there. Tremendous highs and devastating lows. Visually beautiful. I can imagine this is the kind of movie Blu-Ray was made for.   Note for Families: some random language (not much and I felt was (mostly) appropriate to scene), one scene with brief female (top) nudity (blurred) and two scenes with sports violence (boxing) and horse riding accident (scene with \\"will you breeze my horse?\\"). Also suggest reading book for more story and character development.  Enjoy!

B001EYGOEM|1.0|She can't sing high notes. She can't play a catchy guitar riff to save her life. Her music has more soft rock and pop elements than anything else. I am sorry but this is not country. She is a talentless waste of space on the music charts when artists like Lenny Kravitz, The Cardigans and Iron Maiden make more consistant and talented music. Hey at least they can sing in proper tune and make interesting catchy music unlike this generic artists I am reviewing. Yes I listened to the album and no I did not like it. It did not move me and every song blended together to one gigantic wall of boredom.
B000WCDI64|2.0|I love Amy Winehouse's music. However, in this particular show, she was totally out of this planet. I don't know if she was completely drunk or drugged or both, but she can't pronounce any word properly, let alone sing. She MUMBLES the whole show, and even for a native it's really hard to make out any word she is saying. SAD.
0385338694|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It's my favorite book of Sophie Kinsella's besides the Shopaholic series. Samantha is funny and so lost when it comes to domestic duties that I was laughing out loud while I was reading. Her love interest was ofcourse perfect and I happened to like that some of the scenes (especially the ending) in the book played out like a movie.

0807014273|5.0|This book fell into my hands at the perfect time of my life, a time of discouragement and disarray. Reading Frankl's book really inspired me to change my life and take a whole new perspective on every step I take. I was a little skeptical before reading it, thinking that it would be just another Holocaust memoir; but, in fact, it was quite the opposite. Although it gives a good perspective of the suffering that occurred, his main focus was how he took the suffering and learned from it rather than let it take him down. It's an awe-inspiring book. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, both in stages of rock bottom and their prime, it doesn't matter; there's something in it for everyone to learn.
B00005T30L|5.0|With over 300 reviews here, I only want to add a comment: I am an American expat and have lived in Southeast Asia for about eight of the last ten years. People here have this Hollywood-ised view of life in America as all affluent and wonderful. They can't understand why I would want to live abroad. My answer is to show them Ghost World. This is what life in America is really like, lots of lonely people living in drab apartments and pursuing their hobbies to make up for their loneliness and isolation, venturing out in cars to strip malls and fast-food eateries. Ghost World is the truest film I know about life in America.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show can appeal to everyone for a different reason. The cast works so well together. It is a show you can watch again and again and laugh just as hard as you did the first time. Don't miss it!
B001JNNDEW|5.0|Let's face it. Unless you're in management, work is the most boring thing about your day. Especially office work. I've worked in an office for years, and the moment I saw this movie, I knew Mike Judge had wrote from personal experience.<br /><br />This movie is about a guy who hates work so much and does something about it. He just quits going. No worries or cares in the world. His friends, however, are still busting their butt to keep their jobs during \\"house clean up\\", while trying to get him to be more motivated during these times.<br /><br />I'm sure you've all seen Office Space anyway, so you know the comedy is terrific, the cast has great chemistry, and Milton is missing pay checks. Now onto the difference between Blu-Ray and DVD, since this is a review for the Blu-Ray edition of the film.<br /><br />I'd say two years ago, when I bought a PS3 and a few Blu-rays, I never thought I'd buy an older comedy. I made a rule I'd only buy action-type movies on Blu-ray. Comedy can stay on DVD. This film really is one of the best examples of a good transfer. The picture is really, really clear. You can see so much more detail in the little things, that help you feel like you're at work (ugh) with the guys. The sound is awesome, the menu is clever, and most of all, they added all the deleted scenes on the disc. This is a must-buy for comedy lovers, and a must have for anyone who hates their job.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|It was entertaining and fun. A unique look at vampires and werewolves that was enjoyable to go along for the ride.  A lot of action and good special effects. Have fun!
0307269752|4.0|This was an unexpected murder mystery bookended by an all too familiar financial scandal/mystery. Scenes of unimaginable and all too familiar violence against women was at the core of this story and a theme throughout. Historical undercurrents of Nazi extremism were another theme underlying this story (I hadn't really thought about how Nazism as a movement had infiltrated all parts of Europe.)<br /><br />The story starts out slow, and meanders, then suddenly picks up steam until you cannot put the book down because you, like the two main characters in the book must find out the truth. The story you thought you were reading was not the story that was uncovered. The truth is often unexpected.<br /><br />My favorite line: Everyone has their secrets.<br /><br />The writing style is journalistic, the stories are complex -- I read the book in one long day.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|Ouch.<br /><br />I'd like these 100 minutes back, please.<br /><br />This was not what I'd hoped for. Matheson is a great writer but his premise and art have been sorely butchered here.<br />The first half is ok, though the exposition is slow and frankly tedious at times. The highlight of this film is the empty scapes of NYC, very nicely done. Buuuut, as soon as the rather boring \\"monsters\\" show up, it becomes a b-movie horror film, and all of Matheson's concept is subsumed into a different plot line with so many holes they're barely worth mentioning, but glaring nonetheless.<br /><br />I have to wonder what the cast and crew were thinking as they \\"created\\" this. Didn't they see what a piece of crap they were making? How can anyone spend a hundred million or whatever this tripe cost and think it was worth it when there is absolutely nothing redeeming or even remotely enjoyable therein?<br /><br />Truly, you just don't need to watch this movie. See the other cinematic versions of Matheson's fine story, or much better yet, just read the story and get what really matters.<br /><br />Loud, manipulative dystopian messiness with no redemption or cohesion.<br /><br />Pass.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|Death Race isn't the kind of film, that will any awards, in fact from a harsh critical stand point, the film could be seen as nothing more than a big budget B-movie, however that's what makes the film fun. In the lead Jason Statham gives the kind of performance, Stallone would've brought to the film if it were re-made ten years ago. Statham is given plenty of choices to get hit, throw punches and deliver one-liners. In the second male lead as Machine Gun Joe, Tyrese pretty much walks through the role. One would expect Tyrese to have a ball with the role, but ironically he seems bored with the role. However no one watches this type of movie for the acting, you watch it for the action and there's plenty of it in Death Race. So pop some corn, grab a coke and enjoy the ride.
B000Q67876|4.0|This is not a review of the actual movie, because Im assuming that if your looking at the blu-ray that youve probably seen the movie in the 14 or so years its been out.  But what I will say is that this movie is a great movie, an awesome story, with good direction from the same man who directed The Green Mile (Frank Darabont).  The picture with this blu-ray is very good, which is the largest thing your looking for on a blu-ray, and the sound is also meets expectations....A Must Buy
B001GCUNVW|5.0|I've been a fan of Mickey Rourke's since Diner as he is one of the finest actors working in Hollywood. With his come back role in The Wrestler, Rourke gives a performance that will be hard to beat come Oscar time. As retired & washed up wrestler Randy \\"The Ram Robinson\\", Rourke gives a performance that could easily serve as his own life story. Randy is a loveable lug that does what he does because he realizes his life is meaningless and once he tries to change, you realize you can't really escape your comfort zone. The direction by Darren Arronfonsky is easily on par with 2000's Requiem For A Dream and I would love to see what Darren could do with a big budget comic film. The chemistry between actor & director is a natural flow for Rourke & Arronfonksy. The always impressive Marissa Tomei gives another great performance but this film belongs to Rouke who easily gives the performance of his career.
034544678X|5.0|I got my first dog three years ago and have since read many canine training/behviour/psychology books. This is the best for the following reasons:  1) My relationship with my dog has changed thanks to the explanations in the book. It has opened my eyes.  2) The excellent bibliography in the book gives lots of tips for further learning which has been very useful.  3) Excellent blend of science/anecdote - a very accessible book!  Should a friend of mine obtain a dog, this is the book I'll be offering!
B001P3SA94|4.0|After hearing so many bad things, about Cadillac Records I had my initial reservations about seeing the film. However being that I'm a fan of director Darnell Martin's earlier films (I Like It Like That & the vastly misunderstood Prison Song) I decided to give the film a chance. The film tells the story of Chess Records & its founder Leonard Chess (Adrian Brody). Some of the early acts on the label included Muddy Waters (the always excellent Jeffery Wright), Lil Walter (an amazing Columbus Short) and later acts Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (Beyonce). Brody has a hard time carrying a film of this caliber by himself as Chess really isn't given much to do, other than give Cadillac's to his artists. The heart of the film lies in Wright's & Short's performances. The \\"father & son\\" relationship displayed between Muddy & Lil Water was endearing to watch and Short continues to command the screen with this performance. Some of the female cast such as Gabrielle Union & Emuallanle Chrquri are wasted as long suffering housewives, and as for Beyonce, with the material she's given she does a decent job as Etta James. All in all, Cadillac Records may not resonate with classic musical biopics such as Ray & The Temptations, but it's still an enjoyable way to waste a few hours.
141690977X|5.0|This book is a must~read for ALL women who are currently in a relationship, have had past relationships, and are looking for a relationship. This book has some clear insight on men, and I believe can help women open up their eyes and see a little more clearly.  Reflect back and take a look.  And remember that you deserve nothing but the BEST!!! :)
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Good movie all around that the whole family can watch together.  Some want every flick to be \\"Gone With The Wind\\" and I know that it became the thing to do to bash this by comparing it unfavorably to the Matrix franchise but it was good entertainment.  I will mention I never watched the cartoon but this helped me through a bowl of popcorn and made for a family filled enjoyable evening.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Saw this film few years back and just had a chance to revisit it again thanks to netflix.<br />When watched this for the first time, I was literally on the edge of my seat entire length of the movie.<br />This movie was well received by most critics and reviews because of it's plot, beautiful cinematography and grotesque violence/scenes.  Although I agree, what really intrigued me about this movie was the bottom line story.  The fact that how such a seemingly naive ones action in his youth resulted turmoil and pain it caused later in his life.  The way this movies builds up and takes us back and forth from past/current to the ending of this movie was beautifully done.<br />Definitely makes my list of Top 5 favorite movies of all time.
B001794FOK|3.0|I read the original Jumper series by Stephen Gould, the second part being Reflex, then Griffins Story. I have to say they butchered the movie. They definitely should not of cast Hayden Christensen, he is such a bad actor. They should of stuck with the younger kid at the start of the movie. David Rice in the book was a lot younger. They added the whole Paladin story which was none existent in the book also. I know movies never stick the the same plot as the book, but i just thought it could of been way better than it was. Don't get me wrong i still enjoyed it as a sci-fi flick.<br /><br />The best thing in the movie for me was when they introduced Griffin, the kid from England. He made the movie for me. He brought some excitement to it. Soon as Hayden Christensen's appearance came in, the movie went boring.
1577314808|4.0|I think the first half of the book is excellent, and should everybody read it and take action. It is a reminder of some simple things in life. then it gets into relationships, repetitive and so. I guess if it has only half the pages i would give it 4 stars. I recommend it though, and i only recommended to two persons.
0783233477|5.0|This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen, it's not the typical romantic movie everyone is used to and it also leaves a great message.
0375826726|1.0|What a huge disappointment.  I read books 1 & 2 in a matter of weeks.  This one I still have not finished after several months.  The author seems to have gotten a bit full of himself.  He is trying too hard to be like Tolkien or Terry Brooks and has turned into a boring story teller.  There is also way too much unnecessary gore.  Hopefully he will learn from his mistakes for the final book.  This one should really have been cut in half to allow the story to come to conclusion.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|For John Mayer fans, this is not the typical John Mayer, this this is more a blues rock genre other than the common pop we are used to listen from John Mayer. Excellent change, really shows how he has grown as an artist.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show caught me by surprise when a friend suggested it to me.  The appeal of the two brothers fighting the bad creatures really stands out.  You can really tell the two actors have some kind of brotherly thing going on or just really good friends.  It's a must see scary, feel good time.
0307120007|3.0|I loved this book as a child and looked forward to sharing it with my son who also enjoyed it. Unfortunately pages quickly fell apart from the comb binding. I put it back together a few times, but now the holes are ripped, we have lost a page and it cannot be re-assembled. I would consider this to be in the same category as a pop up book in that it can only be used by a toddler with 100% supervision or the book will be destroyed.
0143034901|5.0|I read daily and have read some great books and some real dogs, although I always finish them.  I was ready for a spellbinding, unusual book that would capture my full attention.  This is a good book and one I will repeat one day.  The mystery of Julian was fascinating as well as Nuria and her quest of the past which became Daniel's quest.  There was a fascinating interweaving of characters and the mystery surrounding their horrendous pasts.  I will recommend to all serious readers and read again someday.
B001ED7C58|5.0|okay, i really didnt remeber every single song despite the fact that i saw the movie three times but i was blown away by the Twilight Soundtrack! It was AMAZING! to say the least. infact its my new favorite and i play it over and over again. also there is a solo on it by Robert Pattinson and his voice is incrediable! i absolutely, strongly reccommend this entire cd to everyone!!!!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This was my first experience with Amazon and I'm very happy with it.  This DVD arrived within a week of my ordering it and without the shipping charges, amazing!  The DVD presents our chapter in Space exploration in an informative and entertaining manner. It fills in some of the gaps from movies such as \\"October Sky\\", \\"The Right Stuff\\", and \\"Apollo 13\\".  A must have for anyone who is interested in the \\"Space Race\\".
B000K15VSA|4.0|Its a great set but one final note. The alleged directors cut was different and not that great. The biggest thing that bothers me about the directors cut is it veers from the novel by a lot. The suggestive stupid ending with deccard may be a replicant. That would just ruin the movie for me. Then everyone should be a replicant. It would ruin it for me because in the novel that is not suggested, plus they have a similar ending in the novel as well as the original version. I prefer it because for one it was meant to have the voiceover and the happy ending from the directors cut and with a directors cut it should be restored and not hacked....strangely enough not with the director in charge of it either. At least they make up for that version with the final cut which has ridley scott in charge so we can see what he had in mind for the film.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|first I must say that I think Nickelback is the greatest band of all time! I love all of the albums from Curb to this one. Dark Horse is a great album (though it is raunchy)! The songs are all catchy and upbeat and flat out awesome! There are some real head-bangers like Burn It To The Ground and Next Go Round and a couple nice ballads like I'd Come For You and Never Gonna Be Alone. My personal favorite is Just To Get High. Why? Well, it's inspirational, chorus is catchy as hell, its not too soft, not too heavy and is has an AMAZING guitar solo! Do yourself a favor and buy Dark Horse today, you won't be dissaponited!
B00003CXAT|4.0|FINALLY!  I watched Jurassic Park tonight after telling myself 15 years ago that I'd NEVER watch it!    Why did I change my mind?  Because every single day, for the last 15 years, it was driving me crazy choosing to not ever see a movie that was once considered the biggest film of the year.  Just think about all those Thanksgiving, Easters and Christmas's that went by with me scratching my head wondering what this movie is actually like, and what I'm missing out on.      Just think about all the other times I was doing some kind of activity, whether going to the carnival back in 2003, mowing the yard, taking walks with my dogs, playing video games once a week for the last 15 years, daydreaming.  I was doing these things for many many years unable to think clearly ALL because I couldn't stop wondering what made everyone fall in love with Jurassic Park back in 1993.  I couldn't even take a shower without wondering what the movie was like!      Alright I'm kidding about all that stuff, but you know, I have a good reason why I waited so long to watch a supposed classic.      Alright, it's a horrible reason.  I can't tell a lie.  I was angry that everyone was enjoying something I simply hated- dinosaurs.  Why love dinosaurs?  They are big, ugly extinct creatures that movie creators like to exaggerate when making them, and make them look gigantic, deadly, and extremely powerful.  No point watching a movie when I know I won't like it because I simply don't like dinosaurs, right?  See how close-minded I was back then?  What a sad little dude I was.    NOW, with a fresh mindset, let's approach this movie completely willing to accept its classic tag... unfortunately I can't do that.  The movie let me down a little bit.    As much as it pains me to say it, I was flat out *bored* with the first half of the movie.  Nothing but grown-ups and old guys talking and TALKING some more about dinosaurs without actually showing me anything good.  How am I supposed to appreciate quiet talking?  I can't.  You have to show me something to make me interested in it.      Also, some of the actors just got on my nerves.  They had annoying personalities or something.    So I was thinking about turning the movie off halfway through, and said to myself \\"You know what?  You wanna wait ANOTHER 15 years?\\" and then I sat my buns back down on that chair and continued watching.    Good thing I did, because the second half of the movie was a BIG improvement over the first half.  Finally, HUGE dinosaurs attacking, and watching them move around alongside the humans was simply *amazing* for film-making developers at the time because it looked so realistic.  Nothing quite like it back in the day.  1993 was THE year for amazing film work, no question about it.  It was the year everything started getting good in the studio.    So, the movie is not as good as most people were telling me it was, but then again, I was a kid back in 1993, and so were all the people telling me the movie was great, so yeah, take that for what it's worth.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|While many people might consider this a 'family' of 'kids' movie, my husband and I bought it because of the comedians who perform the voice overs in this film. It's cute enough to entertain kids and funny enough to entertain adults--we had many laugh-out-loud moments.

6305428352|1.0|The dvd came in what seemed to be original shrink wrap. When I popped it into my computer, I was concerned at first because my Media Player noted that the dvd was titled \\"Dead Poet's Society.\\"  A good movie, but not the one I'd ordered. The picture was not clear, and was no more clear when played on my DVD player. A few scenes I recall were deleted. Overall, I was rather disappointed.
B000002KD9|5.0|I have previously mentioned the name Neil Young in this space in connection with his early career as a heavy rock presence with his band Crazy Horse on the album \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\". I noted there that Neil Yong had had many incantations and seemed to have lately taken up the role of folk/ rock elder statesman with some success. In short, through Young's varied career it has been hard to type him. That brings us to the CD under review that kind of makes that point more succinctly that I could on my own.    This album is from the same period and with the same band as \\"Everybody\\" mentioned above but it is far less a rock classic than that effort and a more diverse reflection of Young's talents and interest. Yes, the rocking tense \\"Southern Man\\" ranks right up there with \\"Down By The River\\" and other efforts but there are also classic country tunes like \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\" or the folkie \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" and \\"Till The Morning Comes\\". See what I mean? Folk, rock, country-the only part that seems to be pure fact is that he is an elder statesman of ....music. Listen on.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|I did not like the movie; however, I lent it to my sister-in-law who loved it.  I guess it is a matter taste.

The themes in this movie really do need to be conveyed again to this generation of young children, especially given all the poor conduct in the financial markets of late.     But I am left disappointed by this 45th Anniversary release. I wonder why should I buy this (again) in regular red laser DVD format when children of this age and adults will find a high definition version so much better. Regular DVD players are not even selling in some advanced countries as people move to Blu-Ray. Disney seem to just milk us every several years for a new edition, and this 45th is not really any better than the 40th Anniversary Edition.     Maybe Disney is trying to have us pay for an advertisement for their Broadway version of Mary Poppins, but I don't even care to hear the Broadway show mp3's in this set. If Disney is not simply shoving the Broadway show in our face then why not let us have mp3's of the original performers whom we do recall with some affection?    You'd think those of us, especially those who have seen this since the 1960's would not be so gullible as to buy the 45th Edition, then have to buy it again if/when Disney's 'bean-counters' decide its time to milk the public yet again with the Blu-Ray version some time in the future.    Pardon the cynicism but this is no longer Walt Disney's company - and it has not been since the days of Michael Eisner.    Sorry Mary
B001QB9H1A|4.0|Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is back and this time he is forced to transport Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), an objectionable young woman, across Europe by a group of villains who have fitted Frank and Valentina with explosive bracelets. If either of them move more than 75 feet away from Frank's car, their bracelet will explode.    Given all of the other reviews that I have read of \\"The Transporter 3\\", I went in to this film expecting to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised when I wasn't. Although the script is not quite as good as Luc Besson's previous film, \\"Taken\\", this is more than made up for by the awesome stunts and martial arts sequences (choreographed by Cory Yuen, who was responsible for the action sequences in the previous two films). Two action sequences in particular, one involving Statham effectively performing a striptease while fighting half a dozen villains, and the grand finale on the train, are alone worth the price of admission.    One of the main criticisms that had been leveled at this film is that the heroine is distractingly ugly and annoying. Although Rudakova and Statham seem to have absolutely no chemistry between them at all and I did wonder why Frank Martin was even remotely interested in Valentina, she wasn't so annoying as to ruin the film for me. Valentina is meant to be objectionable, and keeping that in mind, I actually thought Rudakova did a good job of playing her. As for her looks, I didn't think she was bad looking, just different, and I actually thought it was nice to see someone who didn't look the same as every other Hollywood heroine.    As for Jason Statham, I am still not certain as to whether he can act or not, but who really cares. Statham became famous because of his personality and his martial arts skills and both are again on display. Sure this film is somewhat derivative of Statham's other film, in particular \\"Crank\\", but that didn't bother me, and it shouldn't bother other Statham fans either.
0525951113|5.0|Being in the IT world, and always trying to keep up on the latest, greatest technology on the horizon, I have heard of most of the tech that Daniel uses in his book.  The tech today would require very little tweaking to make it work like in the book but it's all possible.  Great book and great use of how the world could be.  And it wouldn't take much to make this happen either.  I learned about this book from Glenn Becks radio broadcast and interview with Daniel.  I would recommend to anyone in the IT world.  Can't wait till the sequel.

0375704027|5.0|Out of all Murakami's books I've read this one is my favourite; Murakami is a master at mixing extremes to create something new and bigger than the compromise that we have come to accept; he often deals with life & death, dreams & reality, passion & routine and reject the notion that they are opposites; in this book, while dealing with those he also reject the notion that hope and despair are opposites; he shows them mixed, one leading to the other and vice-versa.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen.  It has some great acting and great action.  Being able to watch the movie instantly after I bought it was a wonderful perk too.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Without a doubt, the movie has widespread popularity and is proof that this TV series should not have been cancelled.  This is a movie that reminds one the old western movies with gunslingers, bandits and love lost and found.  This is a great movie and with the blu-ray release it becomes even better.  Even if you do not like sci fi, you should try this one. Without a doubt, the movie has widespread popularity and is proof that this TV series should not have been cancelled.

I've discovered that I can't read Janet Evanovich novels like this in bed because even if I don't make any noise, I shake too much with laughter because her books so often hit my funny bone.  She's great!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I am not one to watch movies for some deep or obscure message but rather for the shear entertainment value...This is great entertainment, with a good story line, and enough of the unbelievable to not take itself to seriously.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these headphones with my MP3 player when I workout.  The forward facing speaker design and the way they stay in my ears is ideal when dealing with the large amount of motion at the gym.  I would recommend highly, especially due to low price.
031606792X|4.0|My 13 year old wanted to read these and I was a little worried that hey might be too old for her.  We worked out a deal - I would read them and if they were acceptable, she would find them in her Christmas stocking.  I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging Stephanie Meyer's writing is and they were fine for a 13 year old girl.  As a result, I was buying the next in the Twilight series before I have completed the current read.  My daughter was delighted that she got 4 addiitonal stocking stuffers!
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I thought that The Rising and Devils and Dust were great albums.  Magic had a couple of good songs on it but overall was a disappointment.  I absolutely love Bruce, and I have been listening to him my whole life, but this album really does not rock my world.  The Wrestler and Outlaw Pete were the only two songs that were any good, but neither touches the quality of The Rising or Devils and Dust.  The rest of the album is OK but I often find myself asking the question \\"Would I be listening to this if it wasn't a Bruce album?  I realize that the Boss can't re-write Born to Run every time, but it is not the themes or the sentiment of this album that are lacking.  Another reviewer regarded it as being underwritten and overproduced, and I must say, I totally agree.  Its Pedestrian.
B000O599ZS|4.0|The Searchers is not your \\"typical\\" John Wayne Western. Sure - it is a cowboy movie that is directed by John Ford, and includes a simple story to follow. After the murder and kidnapping of a family member, the Duke and his buddy go searching for the culprits. In this case, a group of Indians led by a chief named Scar are to blame. But, the Searchers is different because John Wayne is much more intense in this role than others. Despite some slow parts in the plot, the Duke pulls off the role with vigor. Also, a few social issues are included as well.<br /><br />Normally I would give this movie five stars, but I simply did not enjoy it as much as some other John Wayne westerns that I have seen. While I think it is worth watching, not sure it is not quite a five-star classic. If you like Westerns, you will most likely enjoy this one. Although be prepared for a different type character than the Duke typically portrays.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is another great film from director Mike Nichols. It is like a postcard from the edge, full of carnal knowledge, unafraid of Virginia Woolf, avoiding any Catch 22's, and the graduate cum laude of the school of hard knocks. Screenplay and the Play it was based on were both written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the Screenplay for Notes on a Scandal.<br /><br />It is a tremendous showcase for the acting talent of the four main characters played by Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman. One is a writer, mostly of obituaries--though he does write one book based on a stripper he meets when she is struck by the cab he's riding in. He falls in love with her instantly, but not deep enough to resist falling for the photographer who later shoots his photo for the book jacket. Then, after a session of cybersex where he pretends to be a woman, he inadvertently engineers the meeting of a dermatologist with his photographer lover.<br /><br />Infidelity and the resulting jealousy are the themes of Closer, along with the related themes of truth and identity. For instance, Alice Ayres, the stripper portrayed by Portman, uses the name of Jane while working. The dermatologist, played by Clive Owen, knows her as Alice, and he tries to get her to call herself that, to reach that level of intimacy--though she is performing a fantasy for him.<br /><br />------------<br />Larry: There's a girl out there who calls herself Venus, what's her real name?<br />Alice: Pluto.<br />=======================<br /><br />But what is Alice's real name? Don't assume you know the answer to that question. This scene was of interest to me because I noticed that throughout the director would often use music, but coming from another room, slightly muffled. How Soon is Now? by The Smiths, a veritable anthem of loneliness, is heard here, but they are in a private room, the Paradise Suite, and though the song speaks to the dermatologist's yearning to be closer, it is muted and subdued.<br /><br />There is another scene at the opera that is played out entirely in the corridors, bar, and foyers. You never hear the opera directly, though it is Mozart's Cosi fan tutte, with Rene Fleming, no less. Another subtle comment on the theme of Closer, for the title, Cos&igrave; fan tutte, literally means \\"Thus do all [women]\\" often roughly translated as \\"Women are like that\\". Mozart and his lyricist Da Ponte took as a theme \\"fianc&eacute;e swapping\\" which dates back to the 13th century, with notable earlier versions being those of Boccaccio's Decameron and Shakespeare's play Cymbeline. Elements from the myth of Procris as found in Ovid's Metamorphoses are also present. Furthermore, it incorporates elements of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Thus, it is a fitting soundtrack for this scene in Closer where the obituary writer realizes that the photographer has just cheated on him with her now ex husband, the dermatologist. Yet, you never see the opera directly, and only hear it indirectly.<br /><br />As well as unheard music the director also makes use of unseen scenes. Sometimes you see two people meet, and then suddenly it is a year later. He leaves all the things that happen in a relationship between the times they fall in love and out of love out of it. He cuts to the chase, as it were. Though you might expect a film of this sort to be hard to follow, it is to the credit of the director that this is never the case. No matter how convoluted the intertwining relationships, you always know who is in or out of love, cheating, cheated on, or what have you. At least you know enough to follow the story, given the high level of ambiguity the characters have about their own real feelings.<br /><br />Patrick Marber, the writer, really makes the most of his material. Really fantastic dialogue, or is it the brilliant acting that makes this shine? Both, actually. There is a scene where Jude Law is flirting with Julia Roberts. It is like a championship tennis match. Law serves his best lines and Roberts slams them right back at him. Bam. Bam. Bam. Match point. When did Julia get to be such a great actress? I used to think she just fell back on her Julia Roberts smile a bit too much. All the acting is of the highest calibre, as is the writing and directing.<br /><br />Here is a little sample of the obituary writer describing how they use euphemisms in their line of work:<br /><br />---------<br />Dan: At six, we stand round the computer and look at the next day's page, make final changes, add a few euphemisms for our own amusement.<br />Alice: Such as?<br />Dan: \\"He was a convivial fellow\\" - meaning he was an alcoholic. \\"He valued his privacy\\" - gay. \\"He enjoyed his privacy\\" - raging queen.<br />Alice: What would my euphemism be?<br />Dan: She was... disarming.<br />Alice: That's not a euphemism.<br />Dan: Yes, it is.<br />==============<br /><br />DIRECTED BY MIKE NICHOLS<br /><br />Charlie Wilson's War (2007)  (with Julia Roberts as Joanne Herring)<br />Postcards from the Edge (1990)<br />[[ASIN:B00000K0DP Carnal Knowledge]] (1971)<br />Catch-22 (1970)<br />[[ASIN:B00079Z9VO The Graduate]] (1967)<br />Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

B001GKJ2DO|3.0|I only watched this film because the PPV selections were limited and thought....hmmmm,  Meryl Streep how can I go wrong even tho I have a great disdain for musicals and never really understood the appeal of ABBA...wow, was I wrong....the movie despite all the surprising perfomances is carried via the most delicate, insightful and endearing lyrics of ABBA songs which I never really paid much attention to....they I believe are the star performance of the film...the location was unnatural and prolly forced to get one's attention for it's superb beauty and Meryl looks just incredible dressed in that deep blue hue....how fun it was to see her sing and dance like a Ziegfield girl!!! LOL  cracked me up and always a joy to be surprised in life at this point...guess this film works best for those of us who have gone thru lotsa family experiences and whatnot....I spose getting older actually has it perks cuz Mamma Mia will fall on deaf ears for the youngest of viewser methinks...Thank you my dear producers for making this happen..I bet this was a very hard sell even tho Chicago and Dreamgirls did well...
031606792X|5.0|The book is nr 4 in the line of S. Mayer Twilight series and the author has written a very delicate ending. Not too hasty nor boring but a delightful closing keeping the readers still interested. I wouldn´t hesitate to recommend the book to anyone I know :)
B001GZPZG2|5.0|-  The Iron Man bust is small at about 1:6 scale, but has a solid weight and attention to detail that even non-collectors will notice.  The $50 gift card is good through 2009, and more then covers the extra cost for the set.  Those inclined to want the mini bust will likely find many more of their geek interest covered by the dozens of items  available on Sideshow Collectibles gift card approved list.    -  The movie case is the full standard multi-disc retail package, so I won't comment on it beyond mentioning two points.  One; it will likely be the Canadian (French/English) cover design with the same disc content as in the US.  Two; it's worth buying the slightly more expensive Blu-ray version if you have an HDTV home theater.    -  IF this sounds like a silly waste of an extra $20-$30, then pass... it's not for you.  However, those who like this kind of set won't be disappointed.  This isn't some cheap bit of molded plastic, it's a genuine collectible.

B000008DA5|1.0|My review is about the sound quality, not about the music itself. I bought this because I was curious about Smiley Smile, and already owned the vinyl LP version of Wild Honey but figured the sound quality of the digital recording would of course be better.    I was wrong! Except for the very last track (a bonus track, \\"Can't Wait Too Long\\") all the material on this CD, including \\"Good Vibrations,\\" is in MONO! Even though the cover art - reproducing that of the vinyl LP - says \\"For STEREO phonographs\\" leaving me to suspect that Capitol Records intentionally tricked people into buying this. What a disappointment.

B000HEWEEE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock, especially her movies made within the last 10 years.  I've already seen it a few times.  It is a romantic fantasy. It may even be considered science fiction since the characters live two years apart.  But, it is essentially a long distance relationship analogy that translates well into real life. The on-screen chemistry is amazing!  Yes, this is a chick flick but I promise you will enjoy this movie! It has become one of my top favorites... Highly recommended!
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I am a big believer that the additional resolution  Blu-Ray provides can be wasted on older films where the picture quality wasn't there to begin with. That's NOT the case here. I've owned The Adventures of Robin Hood on LaserDisc and on standard DVD. The picture quality here is an obvious cut above, due no doubt to the obvious quality of othe original Technicolor print.<br />The supplemental features that are included on this disc, however, are what sets it apart. This should be the standard for Blu-Ray presentations. There are hours of additional material here, all of it interesting, all of it vital. I was reluctant at first to buy The Adventures of Robin Hood after seeing it so many times in the theater and on television and already having a standard version in my collection.<br />After having seen it now on Blu-Ray, I can say without hesitation that I was wrong. This is THE classic title to own and the format to own it in.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I've been a luke warm fan of the series for quite some time.  I find the later episodes a lot more entertaining.  I still watch the reruns, though ;) I was looking forward to seeing The Movie but chose not to go to the movie theater.  I watched it on Movies On Demand.  I had relatively low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the DVD and have viewed several times since.  I'd consider it the perfect chick flick of the season ;)) All in all, if you liked the series even slightly, you will definitely enjoy the movie.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon is a remarkable talent who attracts equally talented people to work with him. This original internet creation, done without studio support during the writers strike, is a weirdly compelling and wonderfully played short piece on the hazards of getting what you wish for. Captain Hammer's entrance alone is worth the price. The songs are terrific too: remember, \\"everyone's a hero in their own way!\\"
B000ZN8036|4.0|My daughter is a wanderer. When Graham Nash wrote 'You, who are on the road...' all those years ago, he was writing about my daughter today.<br /><br />All the above to say this: My daughter says, and I believe her, that too many kids have taken to the road a la Chris McCandless. They've left home to go and do and see and smell and hear and be free. Most of them, she maintains, are woefully unprepared for the rigors of living rough.<br /><br />Flims like this one are marvelous. Films like this also contribute to a lot of copycat kids taking crazy, dangerous, potentially lethal chances because they saw it in a movie. We cannot and should not stop movies like this even if kids get hurt because of them. I'm definitely not a believer in any kind of book/movie banning or censorship. But we also gotta all man up to the fact that these kinds of movies cause a lot of kids to go missing and more to get hurt.<br /><br />All that aside, by the end of the movie I was sobbing freely. And though my daughter is careful to make regular phone calls to me, I begged her (again, again, again) to NOT hitch, to NOT make bad choices, to NOT court danger. Like Emile Hirsch playing Chris McCandless, however, all she could offer me for comfort was a peaceful, joyous, wise smile, a big hug and a promise to continue to try to make good choices.<br /><br />Don't you ever ask them why<br />If they told you, you would cry<br />So just look at them and sigh<br />And know they love you.<br /><br />This is a helluvagood movie. It's not an easy movie to watch but it's superbly acted, directed, written, etc.  Eddie Vedder's songs were just terrific. And the movie is beautiful, too, even as its final horrifying tragedy zips to a slow-motion close.<br /><br />~~<br />Four stars because the mother in me, the mother with a wandering daughter of her own, cannot give it five. The ending hurts too badly.
0425188809|5.0|I have read all of Koontz's books and Watchers was my first, 20 years ago. This book has it all!   1 have yet to find a book that I can still remember so well, which is because of all the emotions the book puts you through. Of course, I have read it more than once, and that is something I can only say about 2 or 3 others in my life, and I have read constantly (meaning I always have a book, or 2, in the process of reading) since I started going to the library at 11 years old and started with \\"Little Women\\". There are really few books that make enough impression, that you remember them years later. I am now 58, so saying Watchers is my favorite book after all these years is saying a lot! I recommend it to everyone and everybody has loved it. I love seeing how many people have passed it on to their children, who in turn say it is their favorite, as does my daughter. This is Koontz's best!!

B001P9KR8U|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\\" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Intrigued by Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector begins to wonder what a young man with no apparent desire for riches is really doing on this game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...    The cast led by Dev Patel (as Jamal) & Freida Pinto (as Latika) is excellent! The directing by Danny Boyle (Oscar-nominated) (who also directed \\"Sunshine\\" (2007), \\"Millions\\" (2004), \\"28 Days Later...\\" (2002), \\"The Beach\\" (2000), \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\" (1997), \\"Trainspotting\\" (1996), & \\"Shallow Grave\\" (1995) & Loveleen Tandan (co-director: India, also did the casting) is brilliant! The screenplay (Oscar-nominated) (based on Vikas Swarup's novel \\"Q & A\\") by Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay to \\"The Full Monty\\" (1997) is brilliant!    The (Oscar-nominated) music by A.R. Rahman is brilliant! The (Oscar-nominated) cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle (who also did the cinematography to Boyle's \\"28 Days Later...\\" & \\"Millions\\") is excellent! The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Chris Dickens (who also did the film editing to \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" (2004) & \\"Hot Fuzz\\" (2007) is brilliant! The casting by Gail Stevens (who also been doing the casting to Boyle's films since \\"Trainspotting\\", except \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\") & Loveleen Tandan is excellent! The production design by Mark Digby (who was an supervising art director on \\"28 Days Later...\\" & \\"Millions\\" is excellent! The set decoration by Michelle Day (who was an art department assistant on \\"28 Days Later...\\" & did the set decoration to \\"Millions\\", \\"Sunshine\\" & \\"28 Weeks Later\\" (2007, which Boyle executive produced) is excellent! The costume design by Suttirat Anne Larlarb (who also did the costume design to \\"Sunshine\\") is excellent!    This is an brilliant drama that is unlike anything you have seen this year or last year, actually. This is Danny Boyle's best film of his career, thus far. This is one of the best films of last year.
0345495004|5.0|Nancy Horan examines complex life, life that cannot be relegated to black and white, but that is nuanced with gray.  In Loving Frank she narrates the exciting and illicit relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney.  Horan draws careful portraits of each based on interviews, letters, historical writing, and newspaper articles.      Both Mamah and Frank were married with families when they met in Oak Park, Illinois.  They left their spouses and young children to travel and live together in Europe.  Their affair became shocking newspaper headlines, and split both families apart.  Mamah finally got a divorce.  Frank's wife would not give him one.    Armed with historical facts Horan uses her own insight and imagination to flesh out the emotional and intellectual struggles Mamah tolerated. Her description of Mamah's initial attraction to Frank, an arrogant self-assured artist, and her gradual understanding that he was a flawed human, who needed to be challenged for taking advantage of others, and for lying to her is a compelling story of discovery.      Horan's account of Mamah's distant relationship with her children, of her sad understanding that she could no longer claim the same intimacy she had had with them, of her reflection on the price she had paid for seeking her own happiness over their well-being is described so clearly the reader is left with anger and compassion for Mamah's deliberate choice.  What are the boundaries between Mamah's happiness and her children's happiness?  What are the obligations of a parent to a child?  Horan lays out the issues, but does not judge.  She lets the reader ponder while Mamah judges herself.    Classic feminist themes are arguments Mamah used to rationalize her choices.  She read Ellen Key, a Swedish feminist who wrote in the fields of family life, ethics and education.  After meeting Keys Mamah translated some of her works into English for the American market.  Throughout the book, until the depressing conclusion, Mamah continues to relate to her children.  She continues to keep herself and her relationship with Frank honest; and she continues to come to grips with the life she has taken on.  She never lets herself off the hook.    Horan's novel is full of ethical questions.  It is full of female issues.  Like real life it is not black and white, but grayed ambiguity.  Horan respects her characters even though she sees their flaws.  In the end she lets the reader form conclusions.
031606792X|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  I have to admit I slogged through the first 3 books, some how reading how Bella spent each moment was a little tiresome at times.  Maybe because I am not a teen, I didn't find those parts so enthralling.  But usually the first 3 books picked up speed half way through and become more enjoyable.  The 4th book though, wham, it started off pretty good and kept the pace going.  There were some weak spots, especially concerning Charlie and Renee, but I don't over analyze fiction books too much as I read them, I just want the fun of them.  This book gave it to me, so I think Breaking Dawn was  a suitable finish for the series.
1439136653|5.0|I saw the movie Slumdog Millionaire last week. It fully deserved the praise that it has received. Well acted, stunningly filmed, filled with moments of drama and humour, it is one of the great modern films.      When I saw the film I had just started the book. I wondered if the one would spoil the other. But they are very different. The general theme is the same. They both tell the story of an Indian Street kid - a slumdog -who gets a chance to win a fortune on the famous TV programme. The film gives us a vivid snapshot of the helplessness of poverty - and the power of wealth. The book takes this to another level.     Its central character Rav moves from one tragic event to another. The one consistent thread is his poverty and helplessness. The narrative is chronologically chaotic. This is because it follows the thread of the questions rather than the thread of Ram's life. And this is the key to one theme of the book - the point of knowledge. When asked how a poor waiter can possibly have known the answers without cheating he says -     \\"And I bet you, if the poor conducted a quiz, the rich wouldn't be able to answer a single question. I don't know the currency of ....France.... but I know how much money Shalini Tai owes our neighbourhood moneylender. I don't know who was the first man on the moon but I can tell you who was first man to produce illegal DVDs in Dhavaru....\\"    The experience that takes him through the questions shows us the pain of his life of poverty. We smell the open drains, we feel the injustice, and we so want him to win.    The book provides some of the most powerful language that I have read. When he meets a beautiful prostitute in a seedy brothel he asks whether she is not afraid of AIDS. She replies -     \\"But it is better to die of disease tomorrow than hunger today, don't you agree?\\"    And when he spends time with some wealthy tourists he becomes disturbed at the effect of comfort -       \\"I wonder what it feels like to have no desires left because you have satisfied them all, smothered them with money even before they are born. Is an existence without desire very desirable? And is the poverty of desire better than rank poverty itself?\\"    This is a great book (and a great movie - a rare double act). It has a more challenging message than a library of books, articles or blogs (!).     I am not telling you what happens. You will have to go and get a copy and read it - now!....

0061564893|5.0|A bit like myself, Gavin Menzies makes the bold claim that history has to be slightly rewritten. In his view the Chinese played a key role a few decades before Columbus -- they sailed round and charted the world well before the Europeans did. The author provides a wealth of details from areas as remote as Australia, North and South America, Antarctica, and so on. Although there are certainly many points of detail which I'm sure will prove wrong if they haven't been already, the overall evidence seems compelling and the journey the reader is taken on is pleasant enough to afford her/him excellent moments. You get out of the book with a sense that, if what mainstream historians do is in general excellent work, conservatism and well-established views, combined to a certain lack of eclecticism, if not lack of courage, might have made them miss obvious connections lying right here in front of their eyes all the time. Highly entertaining, thought-provoking and deadly interesting.<br /><br />Sylvain Tristan, author of \\"Les Lignes d'or\\" (\\"The Golden Lines\\"), Paris, Alph&eacute;e 2005

0743297334|1.0|Ernest Hemingway has made alcoholism into a fine art, because that is basically what all his novels are about. This was the first piece of work I read by him and I wish it had been the last. There was no plot, no meaning, no story and, ultimately no point. The characters were bland and unlikeable. I can sum up the content of the story:  drunkenness, anger, hopelessness, drunkenness, depression, and more drunkenness.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Shekhar Kapur picks where he left off in telling  the story of Elizabeth Tudor in 1998 by presenting his interpretation of the latter half of the Great Gloriana's reign in this 2007 sequel.    It begins in 1585. Elizabeth has been England's ruler for over a quarter century, and is now 52.   She deals with threats of  invasion by Spanish King Phillip II(Jordi Molla), her ex-half-brother-in-law, and plots  against her that are a little closer to home by Scottish Queen Mary Stuart(Samantha Morton), her Catholic cousin, whose legitimate claim to the English throne is supported by Spain and Rome, but who arguably overplays her hand in dealing with her cousin.   Meeting with her council members, her chief advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush)advises her to monitor England's Catholic population more closely. While omitting her famous line, \\"I will not make a window on men's and women's souls\\", the Queen's(onscreen) actions reveal this. She vows to punish her people only based only on their deeds, not their beliefs (which in reality, didn't happen).   The story omits  the Queen's most trusted advisor, William Cecil, as well as Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Cecil, and Robert Devereaux, and focuses on her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh (the ruggedly handsome Clive Owen, with radiant charisma, but looking as though he stepped from the canvas of an oil painting), who has just returned from the New World, having named the colony of Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen, with the bounty of the New World, a few Native Americans, and pirated treasure from Spanish ships in tow.   One has to overlook many historical inaccuracies to enjoy the performances of the beautifully intelligent Abbie Cornish as the Queen's ward, and most-favored lady-in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, Christian Brassington as the Archduke of Austria ( whose appearance recounts an episode of the storied Queen's life that took place earlier than the 1580s), David Threfall as Royal Astrologer, John Dee, whoseprediction  of a war between two Empires, and vaguary surrounding those details troubles Elizabeth, Eddie Redmayne, as Anthony Babington, the Jesuit's recruit to assassinate the English Queen, Rhys Ifans as co-conspirator and envoy to Spain, Robert Reston, and Adam Godley as Francis Walsingham's traitorous brother, William.   We are led through sundry intrigues, and court rituals, as well as the Queen's dramatic response to a threat by a Spanish Ambassador in which she claims to have  an internal \\"hurricane that can strip Spain bare\\", before we come to the high drama surrounding the trial and execution of Mary Stuart, an incident which causes Elizabeth much distress and may well have made her re-live the similar scenario involving her own mother, although she may have been too young to remember the latter.Tom Hollander's Sir Amyas Paulet, presides over the Scottish Queen's demise.    Under the observant eye of his  daughter, the Infanta Isabel (who was actually 21 in 1588, but here is portrayed by child actress Aimee King, decked out like a 16th century Wednesday Addams),a vengeful King Phillip, who supported Mary Stuart, declares Holy War on England.Elizabeth has to forgive Raleigh's seduction of Bess to appoint him as captain of her naval forces.   The climax of the film is the dramatic confrontation of the Spanish Armada, where Henry VIII's once unwelcome daughter presides over an astonishing victory. The cinematography of this scene is particularly bold.   Dealing with life and death matters among her closest subjects shortly thereafter, she settles into her role as mother of her people, and helps England close the 16th century on a golden note.   The acting and the costumes are superb, and I have often felt the best historical dramas are ones that resemble moving oil paintings of the time they depict on canvas. Director Kapur succeeds in creating that effect here.
0141030933|4.0|After the disappointment of Barker's _Life Class_, I was reluctant to read _Regeneration_.  At the urging of a colleague, I gave the book a try.  Based on the real-life institutionalization of poet Sigfried Sassoon (he was considered insane for speaking out against the senseless slaughter of his generation on the Western Front) and his psychiatrist, W.H.R. Rivers, Barker does a solid of job of mixing fact with fiction.  She did this with _Life Class_ as well, bu here the characters were much more sympathetic.<br /><br />Sassoon is really the foil used to show the cost of war on Rivers.  After all, it is Rivers' job to take the psychologically broken men, \\"fix\\" their minds, and send them back to the front.  Unlike his colleagues who cut and amputate, soldiers for whom the war is over, Rivers must face the fact that for many of his patients, the war will continue - both in a psychological and in a real sense.<br /><br />I was most struck by the fact that gradually Rivers himself began to manifest symptoms of battle fatigue - not from a sense of helplessness in the face or mortal danger, but from a crisis of the soul.  Ostensibly his job is to heal; instead, he was merely repairing broken soldiers before returning them to the environment that had broken them in the first place.<br /><br />Another, more subtle message was also apparent, one I felt was appropriate for our own time, as we refuse to show caskets of returning soldiers and the American public politely looks away from the broken youth of our own war on foreign shores.  The bitterness, sense of betrayal and accusatory tone Barker writes of these institutionalized soldiers is a reckoning I believe we will soon have to face.  As Barker put it, \\"If the country demanded that price then it should bloody well look at the result.\\"  I cannot agree more.

B00000I3JO|5.0|For me personally, every Blue Nile release is a life changing moment. I can remember getting every album, and the reactions after hearing every song. This album was the first Blue Nile I purchased, after reading a glowing review in Australian Cosmopolitan magazine ( OK...I was bored waiting for my girlfriend at the time ) and the final sentence described this album \\" as calm and tranquil as floating down the Nile on a hot summer's day \\". Sounded very inviting indeed. By the time the girlfriend was indeed ready to leave the house, the local record store was the first stop planned.     That night, with headphones at the ready......\\" Over the Hillside \\" appeared with it's Linn drum intro. I knew I was hooked. Sweeping strings, lush synth pads, pulsing bass, chiming guitars and that voice......no-one has a voice like Paul Buchanan. He describes his voice as \\" advanced speaking\\". A great description, as that is what happens when he sings to you. When you hear \\" From a Late Night Train \\"....you're there sitting next to him on that late night train going through the city feeling his heartbreak of leaving and unable to go back. What can I say !     I am unashamedly a fan of the 80's, and this and quite a few other albums still stand the test of time. ALL of the tracks in this album evoke the fragility, loneliness, melancholy and hope of love and life. And for all our waiting ( and we still are ) for Blue Nile albums, each release is always well worth the wait. All Blue Nile albums are high watermarks in pop music, and I encourage anyone who believes that music can evoke all things in life to seek this album and the other out.
B00005RRG9|5.0|The star power of Miss Haley Mills in yet another Walt Disney flick reminds you of how both were lucky to find each other. She is graced by two equally powerful stars, Maureen O' Hara and Brian Keith. Even in the premise of a broken home, this cast is one big happy family.<br />A set of young twins seperated at birth, discover their combined heritage under one cabin roof at a girl's camp. This is where the bright young ladies decide to take action, and switch places in order to bring their divorced parents back together again. It's a dramatic rescue in the form of slapstick comedy, that works!<br />There are many familiar cameos from seasoned co-stars that tie the star power lead cast all together in the finest of Disney comedies to grace the screen.

The time spent reading this book was golden.<br /><br />I must have highlighted or underlined a paragraphs worth of info on every single page in the book.<br /><br />This book has one downside though, on every dang page, your going to stop and go, 'Hey, that's something worth thinking about'. It's just has SO much valuable wisdom/advice on every page.. its almost ridiculous!<br /><br />Anyways, if your serious about growing as person, and you want to change your mindset for the better. Switch gears and move on down the road. This is definitely something worth checking out.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I used to tune in to the Big Bang Theory, simply because it was on before \\"How I Met Your Mother\\".  That lasted for all of three episodes.  Now I look forward more to this show.  The writing and acting are out of this world, and with the way Leonard acts, that's not much of a stretch.  I have no doubt that this show will make it over the 4 season hump and who knows where it will end.    The characters are real and you care about them in no time at all.  If that doesn't convince you of the shows qualities, nothing will.  When you start caring for the characters, the story doesn't have to be spot-on every time and that is a writer's dream!

0385340990|4.0|The title of this book almost turned me off but I decided to give it a read. This book may start of kind of slow but quickly it becomes very interesting. The story itself takes place after the German Occupation, but while having such heavy undertones the book never feels heavy. The characters are very interesting and so are there stories, although in the beginning it is hard to keep all their names straight. I wasn't sure if I would like the format it was written in, with it all being letters, but it gives you an even more three-dimensional take on the story and characters. I strongly recommend this book, don't be scared by the long and odd title.
0060751967|4.0|The title of this book really through me off.  After reading some of the other reviews I put the cheesy title aside and ordered it.  I am really glad I did, this book was great.    How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire reminded me of a \\"Twilight, Sookie Stackhouse\\" combo. Kerrelyn Sparks captured the romance that we loved so much in Twilight and the fun, edge of your seat suspense and mystery of the Sookie Stackhouse series. If you enjoyed those two series, you should enjoy this one as well.  It had everything, fun likeable characters, a heart melting romance/love connection, and an interesting story line.    The only negative I have was the climax was built up and over with too fast.  This book could have easily had an additional 20 pages devoted to the climactic ending.
B0018AVNKC|4.0|This uncommon animation starts with tween-aged angst, the kind that demands independence but still wants mom and dad close by. Her busy parents don't have much time for her, though, and her new, remote home doesn't offer much reward for her explorations (other than some rather kooky neighbors). So, even if it's not wholly conscious, Coraline wishes for a nicer place and parents that pay more attention.<br /><br />As the movie's tagline says, \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" Like Alice down the rabbit hole, Coraline finds a secret passage to a more magical place. Soon, however, the magic turns dark. That's where the brilliant animation really comes into its own. The stop animation (or at least the look of it) bring to mind Tim Burton with a macabre touch of Brothers Quay. You know your child best - skittish ones might find some of the imagery a bit much. Still, kids' stories (like Alice in Wonderland) have always had dark edges. That deliciously spooky sense, plus some great animation, really set this movie apart from the usual.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B001O4XWJM|5.0|This movie dissapointed many people because it was not very romantic in its veiws.  It shows the tough life on the frontier for both women and men and the reasons for their choices. I found it very believable and just a great story overall. I pondered what the two friends said and shared and also their interactions with the women. Although I claim to be no genious, I thought the movie to be very deep.  I think it could be discussed for many hours in any sociology class.

1600243916|5.0|Outliers is follows Malcolm Gladwell's style in prior books, a lot of anecdotes, sometimes might seem disjointed but that is the real value. You get to make your own conclusions about stuff. A lot of great information for anyone that desires to be successful in any trade, skill or business. He talks through what sounds like the fly wheel concept, it takes 10,000 to build success in any business or endeavor. But more importantly, he explains outliers in terms of the opportunities they get as a result of the place and time of their birth to parentage and general accidents of providence.    But it also helps people to think through how best optimize their life's circumstance inspite of their place in life.  I just loved the sense of possibilities the book creates, but much more it provides a realistic assessment of success. The story of self made men while in some respects might be true, it is not totally true. We are a product of hardwork, our background, time and place of birth. A lot of life is just showing up, beign in the right place at the right time.     I know for technical research people, this book might not meet the test of research rigor, however, from my point of view it serves enough purpose and provides enough insight to be able to make the best decision.     All in all, it is an excellent book, I read it, I listened to it, and if there were a video, I would watch it too. If you care about success, if you have children just go grab a copy for yourself and every one you care about.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a bright star in a sky full of sometimes overdone, distasteful stories of enduring love.

1591840562|2.0|I can't even possibly imagine giving this book 5 stars, let alone 4. I get really annoyed when people rate books so high, just b/c they have a catchy name or something.    From the standpoint of someone who actually wants to create an actual business from an idea - this book offers almost nothing. A lot of his advice and anecdotes come from his launch of Macintosh back in 1984. In fact the way he talks about running a business - most of the time at least - he assumes you ALREADY HAVE a business up and running. For example, some chapters of the books are spent talking about how to get good employees, how to deal with your board of directors, whether or not to run the business at full capacity. 90% of this stuff, the way it is framed at least, is not relevant at all to someone who does not yet have the million dollar business.    I would say that this book would be more correctly titled, \\"how to launch a new product\\". A lot of it is based on the PR, and advertising side of things, and generally how to create excitement and buzz.     One part of the book I really did not like is how he describes how you should pitch yourself to VCs (venture capitalists). Kawasaki himself runs a venture capitalist firm, so he is used to getting inundated with bad offers. His assumption is that your business idea sucks, and he pretty much disparages almost everything that is said at these presentations as \\"Lies\\". Literally, there is a section called, the 10 Old Lies I don't want to hear, or something like that.     Generally speaking, there are a few gems scattered in odd places through out the book, but it is mostly not that great. I would not recommend reading it to someone starting a completely new business from scratch.     To someone launching a new product from an existing business, I could see how it might be useful. I'd be hesitant even then.

This is like finding a mouse in a fast food burger - kind of undermines the brand name.  Too bad - Jack Reacher used to have a lot going for him.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|In some ways Righteous Kill is a waste of great talent.  The story is conventional--a vigilante cop is killing perps who escape the legal system through technicalities.  We've seen it all before.  Here there is a twist--the apparent vigilante may actually not be guilty of the crimes.  On that slender thread are hung the abilities of two of our greatest living cinematic actors.  The film held my attention, though the subplot was shaky and the conclusion largely predictable.  The supporting cast is effective and the direction is workmanlike.  This is a rental.
0393061310|5.0|\\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" - Outstanding -but not for everyone.  This is not so much a novel but rather a text book written in novel style.  Withour some scientific background - basic biology, genetics, etc. I would suggest one would enjoy the book a bit less but if interested in the subject matter should give it a try. I would highly recommend the book for puting forth very reasonable answers to fundamental questions regarding societies and their relative success and failure. Great ideas presented well.
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|I would give this 2.5 stars out of 5. This is a rather mediocre album except for the two standout singles (you know the ones). It is very slickly produced, and the tracks are certainly tuneful, but they just aren't very good tunes. They are also programmatic. The album wears thin quickly, as well. So I simply have stopped listening to it (except for an occasional spin for background noise, or for the singles), unlike most of my favorite pop albums, which, contrary to their reputation as 'pop' albums, often hold up very well. Katy Perry has clearly traded on her sex appeal, and this is fine, since it's part of what makes entertainment exciting in the first place. But don't be fooled. Download the singles if you like them, but don't shell out the money. I am not wholly against the album--it's okay as far as this sort of thing goes--but itunes or the used cd route are probably the way to go here. (By the way, Robyn is the best pop out there now. Buy Robyn!)

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a knack for introducing entirely new perspectives and then developing them so well that they stick with one forever.  His subjects are eclectic, almost challenging the reader at first to even believe their relevance.  But like a master artist, he doesn't try to cram lots of unrelated themes into one's consciousness, but he expands one's consciousness to encompass all that these diverse topics have to teach us.  And for that I would give him five stars.    So why only four?    It's page 268, where he is sounding the final chords of his thesis, and he just hits an entirely wrong note, spoiling the credibility of an otherwise amazing book.  After giving a convincing argument that people like Bill Gates owe a majority of their success to the context and the culture and the communities in which they came from, and after arguing (successfully) that many, many others could also do great things if society were not so good at arbitrarily destroying those opportunities for the rest of us, he attempts to reinforce that point by saying    \\"We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteen-year-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur.  But that is the wrong lesson.  Our world only allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a time-sharing terminal in 1968.  If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today?\\"    This is a most ironic question, and one that I am shocked made it past his editors, because in the case of Bill Gates, it was Gates himself who, time and time again, made sure that NOBODY would ever succeed as he did.  When a young farm boy found himself in the early 1990s with unlimited time at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in Champagne-Urbana, he took what was then an all-text internet program (grandiosely called \\"The World Wide Web\\") and actually made it The World Wide Web by adding graphics and creating a user-friendlybrowser.  Marc Andresen became the face of the World Wide Web in 1994, URLs wound up plastered on billboards and city buses, and we all became suddenly connected. And within one year, Micrsoft's resolve to crush Netscape by abusing their monopoly power over the desktop became the basis of the biggest anti-trust trial in the late 1990s.  Microsoft lost that battle (meaning that the Judge agreed that Microsoft's behavior was illegal), but Bill Gates bamboozled the court by claiming that Microsoft could not change its behavior one iota without destroying the company completely.  The court blinked, and Microsoft was not punished.    There are countless other cases where Bill Gates bullied, threatened, undermined, and flat-out destroyed numerous innovations that should themselves have been great success stories in outliers.  Indeed, the One Laptop Per Child project, which sought precisely to become the fountain by which millions of children throughout the world would have unlimited access to computing resources could fulfill precisely the dream that Gladwell imagines.  But it was Microsoft that set out to destroy that dream, and that is the reason those million minds will be dim instead of bright, and dependent instead of productive.    It is an absolute shame that Gladwell missed this point which numerous anti-trust trials have made so plain.    With that single exception, the rest of the book is classic Gladwell: surprising, insightful, and fun to read.

0451530977|5.0|TREASURE ISLAND was first published in 1883 by Cassell & Company, Limited, London, England.  Has probably never been out of print since, though first published as a serial in a boy's magazine, it has become a book for almost everyone.    Some editions of the book have a map included, others do not.  My 1965 edition of Signet Classics does not, but my later Signet edition does. Some readers find the map interesting and helpful, others such as LORD OF THE FLIES author, William Golding, referred to the map, as only an \\"overrated chart\\".  When reading introductions or afterwords in the various editions of TREASURE ISLAND one can find almost anything, from praise or lack of praise where Robert Louis Stevenson is concerned.  Since I know little of his Scottish background or Calvinism or much of anything else of the man, I find TREASURE ISLAND only a very fine book and am not surprised at all that, though it began its life as somewhat a failure as a magazine serial, it has become a lasting classic.    Even should one not have read the book, characters such as Long John Silver, Jim Hawkins, Blind Pew, Black Dog or Billy Bones and various other terms such as pieces of eight, or black spot, are familiar terms in and of themselves.  Though some reviewers say the characters are only two dimensional, RLS certainly put enough of them in the book.  There are more than enough black hearted pirates to go 'round, and in the character of Long John Silver Stevenson struck pure gold.  So much in fact that his original title for TREASURE ISLAND almost was 'The Sea Cook' based on the part ole 'barbecue' (Long John Silver) has aboard the Hispaniola.  Yes, Silver is a character well worth his salt, starting out somewhat good, becoming bad, and then morphing back into somewhat good, a character to remain long after the reading.  And he escapes the gibbet in the end, not an easy feat in England at that time.  Before reading the book I had felt it to be an 'Englishman's' book of England ofsorts, yet nothing is farther from the truth, as Robert Louis Stevenson was very much a man of Scotland and the book becomes more of a Scotman's view of the English. Interesting indeed with some subtle truths and asides if one recognizes them.    Stevenson started with only the map, one he had drawn for his young stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, yet this map gave birth to the novel.  Stevenson's father gave idea to Billy Bone's trunk and its contents, going so far as picking the name Walrus for evil Captain Flint's old ship.  From stepson Lloyd we also get the structure and stricture that there be no girls in this book, only male sailors and pirates. Lloyd wanted a boy's book of treasure and pirates.  Fortunately girl readers have had as much enjoyment as the boys down through the years.    If a reader enjoys a return to their youth of pirate ships, pirates, and an island of treasure to the amount of 700,000, then get on board the Hispaniola and ride with this group to Treasure Island.    Semper Fi.
0061562408|5.0|When a friend recommended this book I shrugged and thought it would not be something I'd like. I am allergic to dogs and have never owned one. Boy, was I mistaken! Enzo captured my heart from the first page and continued to hold it as I finished the book in one sitting.  I'm impressed that anyone can get inside an animal's head the way Stein did.   Couching the story as a view from a soon-to-be-human animal is clever. This story has it all, humor, pathos--you name it. It's good reading no matter what your relationship to animals might be. It makes me want to get allergy shots and a dog!

0930289234|3.0|Alan Moore skillfully creates a dreary and dangerous world in this graphic novel. It is a grim and unpleasant place. When you pick up this story, you are immersed in this world as immediately as if you did a dumpster dive into the urban human mind. I sought in vain for someone in the story that was likeable. Most of the major characters (and there are many) are angry, violent, paranoid and unstable. Nevertheless, it is a well done dystopia. The story is interesting, the suspense builds steadily, and if you can follow it, you will be hooked. On the mood scale, this work felt more downbeat than The Dark Knight. That seems to be the latest Hollywood zeitgeist. This story is bound for Hollywood, in spite of Alan Moore's protests. Of course, Alan Moore protests just about everything. Maybe that is why his imaginary universes are so dysfunctional.<br />The graphics are uniformly excellent. The reader should examine them closely, because they contain a lot of the story content. This is not a novel for the visually impaired. At times, the amount of information is overwhelming. I began to feel like I do in the aisles of a big box store.<br />There are often two or three storylines going forward simultaneously. It takes some effort to make sense of them, especially if you put the book down for a while. Eventually the plots converge in an unholy meeting.<br />I often wondered where the author's true feelings were. Some of the characters expound on their view o f humanity, the universe, and the problems therein. Their views are not nuanced. Their solutions are problematic. But the author is not his characters, and they don't speak for him, they speak for themselves. I recognize Alan Moore's talent, and I recommend The Watchmen to all of his fans, in spite of Time Magazine's review.

B00006ZXSK|4.0|Drew Barrymore stars as Danielle in this retelling of the Cinderella legend, which substitutes a capable young woman for the Disney version of a helpless girl who depends on the love of a prince to rescue her from misery.  One gets the feeling that Danielle would have managed even without her prince (Dougray Scott), whom she saves from outlaws at one point.  In one of my favorite scenes, the Prince rushes off to rescue Danielle from great peril, only to meet her coming back, having capably dealt with the situation herself.  There is no sorcery in this version; Leonardo da Vinci fills the role of the Fairy Godmother.    Danielle's independence does not mean that there is nothing at stake in this film.  There is a strong love story and while I did not fear for her safety, I did for her happiness.  This is a wonderful film that misses greatness by succumbing too easily to conventions of the romance genre while shattering the conventions of the fairy tale.

031606792X|4.0|I have read and enjoyed all the other 3 books of the Twilight series.  I was very aware that this was a teen book after reading this book.  I thought it was a good and happy ending to the series, but it did leave me wanting more.<br /><br />I was distracted by Jacob's book at the beginning.  I thought his addition, while needed, was actually unnecessary in the depth that it went.  I felt as a result the other books were rushed.  I think this book would have been better as 2 separate books instead of 1.<br /><br />I wanted to focus more on the Bella and Edward's wedding and their love.  I think I join thousands who were left wanting more during the honeymoon.

I have used NVC and found it to untangle difficult communication situations, enhance normal communication and has even helped me listen to myself better.  I plan to adopt NVC as a regular part of my daily life.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|An artful turn of phrase, an upturned eyebrow, and a casual air in the midst of a deadly situation means only one thing:  James Bond has returned.  Curiously absent on the big screen for the last half-decade, the famous, womanizing MI6 agent ignited the fires of controversy--off-screen for a change--when gossip-mongers discovered that the actor cast for the role would be, gasp, blond.  Luckily, the producers and directors of \\"Casino Royale\\" forged ahead regardless, giving actor Daniel Craig (\\"Layer Cake\\") a chance to prove his worth.  The short version of this review would be that he succeeded spectacularly; further, he was working with one of the best scripts the series has had in years.  The long version of this review, as befits this reviewer's compulsion, will continue below.<br /><br />By the mid-to-late 1980's, fans were beginning to view the franchise in a light similar to how nearly all Americans viewed \\"SNL\\" since the seventies--as a once-great thing long past its peak.  Then, \\"Goldeneye\\" was released, and new life entered the series as a new generation was indoctrinated into the cult of the Sultan of Suave.  Pierce Brosnan was the new captain, but even his brave leadership couldn't save future episodes (\\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" \\"The World is Not Enough,\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\") from being simply okay at best, and silly at worst.  Another idea floating around is the somewhat specious view that the \\"Austin Powers\\" franchise diminished Fleming's cinematic translations.  This is convenient in that blame is removed from the producers, writers, and directors of the Bond films, which was probably the entire reason for forwarding such as ridiculous idea in the first place.  Regardless, the series was far past the time for something new--director Martin Campbell (\\"Goldeneye,\\" \\"Beyond Borders\\") proves far more than capable at injecting a little modernity into the aging series.  Ironically, he pulls this off by starting at the beginning:  the beginning of Bond's \\"00\\" career, of Fleming's novels, and of the agent's descent into total emotional detachment.  Campbell is not above resurrecting a few ideas and scenes from past \\"Bond\\" films--several of which may be lost of today's audience--but the overall effect still feels remarkably fresh.<br /><br />Everything chic and hip happens in Prague, so naturally that is exactly where Bond earns his \\"00\\" status.  He kills Dryden, a regional MI6 section chief who has been appropriating extra funds illegally.  After obtaining his promotion to \\"007\\" designation, we find James on surveillance duty in Madagascar.  His partner bungles his cover and is made by the target, prompting the movie's first chase sequence.  Chasing his acrobatic quarry through construction sites and city streets, James is finally able to corner him in an embassy.  Interested only in the target's bag, Bond kills the man and blows up most of the embassy in what must be the world's most elaborate distractionary gambit.  Finding a text message which says only \\"ellipsis,\\" he begins on a journey to unravel a tangled web consisting of international crime syndicates, stock market manipulation, and Le Chiffre, (Mads Mikkelsen, \\"King Arthur\\") a banker who finances terror.  Along the pathway to illumination, James finds time to play perhaps the largest-stake Texas Hold `em game ever, win the heart of Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), hack into M's personal computer account, and seduce a vixen after first stripping her husband...of several thousand dollars, his pride, and his classic Aston Martin, that is.<br /><br />This film shows the filmmaker's desire to reinvent the franchise.  \\"Casino Royale\\" was Fleming's first novel, and this movie seeks to similarly begin a new Bond continuum, with no relation to prior films in the series.  As such, Craig's Bond is permitted to be shown as a flawed, vulnerable, and green agent who does not yet bear the scars of cumulative experiences.  He is recognizable as the agent we know--brash, arrogant, ruthless, and philandering--but seems to almost be the adolescent version of later manifestations.  The deep wound he sustains by the conclusion of \\"Casino Royale\\" may provide the viewer with a sense of why his later versions seemed so apathetic and aloof regarding--supposedly--key emotions like compassion, love, and honor.  Prior to this film, the character of Bond seemed axiomatic:  he simply was, and he was not a result of anything.  Perhaps the success of this movie over its predecessors is partially due to better audience identification with the main character--it's easier to root for someone that you identify as human.<br /><br />Forget the character, for this is a Bond movie, right?  That means blazing action sequences, smoldering women, hotter cars, technobabble, and cutting wisecracks garnished with the perfect martini to most fans.  Fans need not fear to the slightest degree.  Two of the chase sequences had my wife suspecting that I'd prefer a seat inside the screen, so riveted by the onscreen action was I.  I'll never view an airplane refueling truck the same way again.  Solange (Caterina Murino) heats up the screen with vibrant Mediterranean allure, probably causing most male viewers to miss the gist of several lines of dialogue.  However, Eva Green as Vesper succeeds in taking first prize in the sex appeal department--despite a rather mousy appearance--via simple combination:  presence, presence, and presence.  The unspoken suggestion present in every line of dialogue between her and James is hotter than even Solange's bikini-on-horseback scene.  Aston Martin brings several representative vehicles into the film--one car being most unfortunate, more's the pity.  Speaking of Bond's Aston Martin, it conveniently comes equipped with cardiac defibrillator, chemical blood analyzer, silenced pistol, and GPS locator, so technophiles everywhere should be assuaged their concerns.  Finally, James Bond--even as an agent just starting out--achieves a sum total of wit in one half sentence which most people aspire to in their entire lives.  He even manages to be witty without actually uttering an entire phrase--as an audience, we so easily accept his innate verve that we are willing to forgive him such extraneous matters as actually finishing the witty sentence.  In summary, 007 is supernaturally charming, capable, lucky, desirable, and macho, but this time, he's human, too.<br /><br />The movie had me chuckling from the moment Le Chiffre first took a puff from his silver inhaler to when Craig finally uttered the immortal introduction.  The tension was present from the bathroom brawl to the final confrontation in a doomed building.  The conspiracy runs deep and the movie may require several viewing before a viewer feels comfortable with the plot; however, the story does not end with the credits.  Fans of \\"Dr. No\\" will note a playfully inverted take on perhaps the most famous Bond girl introduction scene of all time.  \\"Casino Royale\\" is only the first movie of a planned trilogy, (the second film, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" was out last fall) so expect even more character development, as opposed to what you may be familiar with:  an indestructible, unaltered agent who operates in a vacuum, without memory or care of past events.

1401216676|5.0|Alan Moore has this amazing ability to take a simple idea and flip it upside-down to analyze things for the rest of the world.  His work in Watchmen really brought about a lot of thinking for the reader.  To bring so much reality to his stories makes the reading a million times more worthwhile.  If you read this novel or Watchmen, you WILL want more Alan Moore.  His writing is one of a kind and he is his own dark,unique machine.<br /><br />The Killing Joke is really an entirely new take on the Joker.  Moore's portrayal is absolutely fascinating and I wore the Joker's grin half the time reading it.  I like writers that don't simplify these villains and instead they write gruesome scemes and elaborate insanity within these characters.  After all, whats the point of a villain if he isn't genuinly threatening.  The Joker in this story is one of the scariest incarnations of him.  Seeing this frighteningly epic story unfold was extremely joyful<br /><br />Notice I didn't really mention Batman.  Batman plays a significant part, but the Joker really takes the spotlight.  If you are looking for a graphic novel along these lines, then look no further.  One of your favorites is waiting to be read.

We also never played the older edition, so I wouldn't be able to compare this newer one to the older one anyway.  The reason for the purchase, was, a family member suggesting to me that this would be a great game for our teenage son.  We had played \\"Ticket to Ride\\" while on vacation, and although it took a while to get the hang of it, we decided to give The Settlers of Catan a try.  We are still learning it as we go, but it is nice to have an alternative to the \\"game systems\\" games and play the old fashioned way, \\"board style\\" every once and a while.  I think it helps to have someone who's played it before to play it with you in the beginning. I think we will continue to play it and learn the many strategies, etc., so I would say that it was a great purchase.  I am always looking for games that stretch the mind!

B000UD08HW|3.0|The music is top notch as well as the docs, but the HD is grainy and blown out in sections. The issue really is how it's shot. The production is terrible, not only because they overexposed during shooting, but because they used more than one type of camera during production. It obvious from shot to shot which cameras had the better lenses and 4:2:2 color space. The HD quality is disappointing only because I own a bunch of other shows, like the latest ZZTOP release and the images are crystal clear. The music (DG guitar solos are mesmerizing) and special features save this release... Gilmour still can deliver the goods.

B000002TYX|4.0|Anthology 1 is the first of a three volume collection and was released 1995. We get a new track called \\"Free as a bird\\" and this was billed as the first new Beatles in 25 years. We also get to hear mono versions of songs, different takes (Can't buy me love takes 1 and 2) and songs played by prior members like Pete Best and Stuart Suthcliffe. The sound quality of the early songs is quite poor and it is sometimes hard to hear what they sing. 4/5.
B001AEF6IQ|4.0|This is a really great Sci-Fi series on the BBC that I happened upon, being a big doctor who fan.  It stars John Barrowman, who was Captain Jack in the new doctor who series.  It is very edgy and adult with lots of great humor.     Getting this on blu-ray is well worth it for all the great action sequences and the extas are pretty cool too.  There is a gag reel and tons of behind the scenes clips.  I would highly recommend this to any sci-fi or doctor who fan.

The album was quite successful and reached top ten in countries like Sweden, Norway and France. The cover of the CD booklet has a photo of a couple dancing. The lyrics are easy to read if a bit small and we get a great list of whom plays what. 4/5.

B00005JLWN|1.0|While Christian Bale is easy on the eyes, this anti-hero's acting is stilted and predictable.  The movie on the whole had a nice concept, but the ridiculous fight scenes distracted from the dystopian message.  I was generally disappointed and sorry that I wasted my money.

This book has a few ideas that are revolutionary and quite useful to anyone  serious about their marriage. I totally recomend this book.
0307269752|4.0|This book starts slow (and I do mean slow - 100 pages of explanation of Swedish finance and economics to establish the background), but suddenly pulls the reader in. While the elaborate set-up is sometimes tedious, it is completely necessary to create a backdrop to the mystery, which actually ends 100 pages before the end of the novel. The final 100 pages are then payoff for all of your studying in the first 100, and presumably lay the groundwork for the next two books in the trilogy. In short, stick out those slow opening chapters, it's worth it.<br /><br />The story's setup is a traditional 'locked room' mystery. Forty years ago the favorite granddaughter of one of Sweden's captains of industry, Henrik Vanger, went missing, presumably murdered. Blomkvist, the lately down-and-out journalist, is hired to do a biography of the Vanger family and maybe solve the mystery along the way. He eventually ends up with a research partner in Lisbeth Salander, a gothed out, anti-social, abused young woman with Asperger's Syndrome. She is cold, analytical, and angry. She always gets even. And you will love her. Will they solve the mystery? Will they be killed along the way? Will Blomkvist regain his journalistic credibility? These are the surface concerns that drive the mystery.<br /><br />The Swedish title of the book is something closer to Men Who Hate Women, and the entire book revolves around this theme. Not just in the murder mystery portion, but in the social interactions of the male and female characters. The Sweds are clearly as misogynistic as the rest of the West. This is the real plot that drives the book. The author handles his theme deftly. Larsson is clearly sympathetic to the omnipresent dangers to women in porno-driven, patriarchal, Western society. His scenes of violence are never gratuitous, and he does not linger on the abuse of women in a voyeuristic way, unlike so many films, tv shows, and books that seem to relish the display of imperiled women. Larsson also reverses sexual stereotypes (not as feminist as rejecting them altogether, but it's a place to start); his male lead, Blomkvist, does not run around 'saving' the women in this novel. His female lead Salander is no damsel in distress. She relies on no one but herself and is perfectly capable of extracting herself from dangerous situations by using her analytical brain. Through Salander (clearly Larsson's favorite character, despite the initial focus on Blomkvist) Larsson comments on the failed governmental structures in place to prevent abuse, the unpleasant daily capitulations women must make to save themselves, and the unfortunate realities for women who fall between the cracks of society. Not only does Larsson comment, he gets angry. And you *definitely* want to see Salander angry.<br /><br />The 100 pages at the end of the book wrapping the story back around to the first 100 are increasingly implausible. The tale takes a veer into Jennifer-Garner-in-Alias territory before the book's denouement. On the whole though, a satisfying mystery, a thought-provoking social commentary, and a solid beginning to what promises to be a riveting trilogy.stereotypes (not as feminist as rejecting them altogether, but it's a place to start); his male lead, Blomkvist, does not run around 'saving' the women in this novel.

B000J103OI|4.0|This movie works because the three central chracters (Andrea Sachs, Miranda Priestly, and Emily) are so interesting. This movie does not work as well as it should because it focuses too much of its time on the relatively banal peripheral (Andrea's boyfriend, friends, and father etc) characters.<br /><br />That is really too bad because I found Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) to be one of the most fascinating characters I have seen in the movies in a long time. At the end of the movie, the viewer is left wanting to know more of her. Yet we know so little of her except her superficial outerself which so obviously belies something far more complex.<br /><br />The central character, Andrea Sachs, is played by ever so likeable Anne Hathaway. When Anne Hatahaway plays a character, it is very hard to dislike that character. That ability is a major plus in a starlet, but it also limits her ability to play different and more complex roles.<br /><br />Emily Blunt (who plays Emily) is, as Meryl Streep describes her, one of the best, if not the best, young actresses today. She successfully makes her limited role into a colorful and memorable character.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, you will feel entertained and glad to know the glimpses of the 3 main characters. But you will also wish you had known more of them.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is an astonishingly frank look at the difficulties of facing Alzheimer's disease...from the victim's perspective. Although it is fiction, it's not hard to believe this is how someone with AD would view the world. I felt as though I was inside the head of Alice as month, by month she recognizes her spiral towards a smaller life. Far from being depressing (as I was afraid it might be) the way Alice cherishes the memories she still has was truly moving and became a reminder to celebrate every day. Thank you Lisa Genova for an exceptional work that you believed in enough to publish.

031606792X|2.0|After reading \\"Eclipse\\" I found myself rushing to two stores to buy \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and ravaging it as soon as possible. After all, there was going to be a wedding and I had heard that Bella would bear a child. However, by the middle of the book, I was so disturbed, bored, and disgusted by the turn of events that I seriously considered not finishing it. You know how you are reading a book and you just keep wishing for it to get better so you don't feel as if you have wasted an entire afternoon on nothing? Well, by the time I finished, I felt a wave of disappointment. Here's why:  1. While I know these books are geared toward teenage girls who shouldn't be reading about sex, I found the whole honeymoon glaze-over the sex scenes too G rated. Not to mention Edward's attitude during their stay on the island. Then Bella gets pregnant way too soon and all Edward wants to do is destroy the \\"thing\\" growing inside of her.  2. The pregnancy. Why would I want to read about the gory details of giving birth to a demon baby? I'm not watching a horror movie. This is a romance novel. Bella's attachment to something that only drank blood and continually kicked the crap out of her was too much.   3. Renesme. I hate the name. It's not easy to say.   4. Jacob changing from an I hate bloodsuckers Bella-loving werewolf to an imprinting-a-baby-because-of-some-magical-love-at-first-sight crap dog who no longer notices Bella romantically was pathetic. First of all, we already were told a similar story from Jacob about one of his clan. Second, doesn't this whole idea reek of sexual perversion? It's okay to be in love with someone under the age of 18 because it was meant to be? Someone please call Dateline on this one. Why would Jacob dedicate his life to loving someone who was part vampire? Is he a masochist?  5. Bella's abilities. Isn't it all to convenient that Bella's transformation to a vampire is not only easy and gives her superpowers beyond the others, but that she doesn't lose any piece of her humanity in the process? She still thinks and acts like human Bella. Being in her mind as a vampire was no different than being in her human mind.  6. The \\"Battle\\". We spend the second half of the book preparing for an epic battle that could end the lives of Bella and Edward. Bella prepares to have Jacob take her daughter away to safety. Everyone's gathering and learning to fight. Then what? No actual battle occurs? Anticlimactic and boring.   Where are the romantic conversations between Bella & Edward?  As a reader, not as a fan, I was hoping that Bella would die. Remember the beginning of Twilight when she said that dying in place of someone else would be a good way to go? Wouldn't that bring the book full circle better than \\"everyone forgave everyone and lived happily ever after?  If I had better writing talent, I would take this story after the wedding and erase the rest and redo it properly. I love Edward & Bella but \\"Breaking Dawn\\" could use a rewrite.

B000FIMG68|5.0|It would take me a million ways to describe my love for this brilliant show. I've been watching lost since the beginning and have always been impressed.<br /><br />Season 2 brings us to the famous discovery of the hatch, Desmond, and infamous Henry Gale (an other??) I am not going to spoil any of the details if you have not watched. As the show developed into season 2 you really got a feel for these characters. Who they are, what they were made of , and how far will they go for themselves or each other. The answers come slow, but they do come and when they do, they are beyond words.<br /><br />This show requires patience and time. If you can sit back, relax and pop the DVD in you will be hooked. Trust me! It could def get frustrating at times and make u ask yourself \\"OK what the HELL is going on?\\" but at the end of the day you realize how important each episode truly is and how much knowledge you get with every season.<br /><br />Not only is this show excellent (Thanks to JJ, Carlton, & Damon) but it involves a great group of actors who make it feel so real and extraordinary.<br /><br />The most current season is getting very exciting and if you are new to the Lost \\"cult\\" I suggest you keep going and hang on because you are in for the ride of your life.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|Although I don't understand why, instead of New York the city of Paris was the setting for its final episodes, SEX AND THE CITY stands as a memorable adults-only melodrama.  Now that's it's only on television in censored edits on a basic cable station, you must see these D.V.D.s for everything H.B.O. viewers got to watch years ago.    Fortunately it's Kim Cattrall, the show's hottest actress, who does nude scenes most freqently on SEX AND THE CITY - and shows the most of her incredible body.  Cynthia Nixon does a few topless shots and Kristin Davis takes her top off once or twice but neither girl lets you see more than that.  The show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker, keeps her clothes on despite that great figure of hers - not even thong panties.    But Parker's character Carrie is the most interesting one on SEX AND THE CITY, chasing men who mistreat her and rejecting the guys who are good to her, the former represented most often by a guy she calls Big, the latter a boyfriend named Aiden.  And it does not seem to be Big's money or Aiden's good-not-great income that makes the difference to her.  Carrie just wants what she can't have.  Oddly, SEX AND THE CITY never has Carrie realize this, as the show's final episodes indicate.    My biggest complaint about SEX AND THE CITY is that these women are so well-off they have more time than they should to worry about men.  Toward the end of the series, however, there is a story about one of the women that adds a dose of reality to the fantasy lives they live.  But overall SEX AND THE CITY's lives and loves of a public relation executive, art gallery director, newspaper columnist, and attorney don't reflect what life in the Big Apple is like for the vast majority of the women who live there.  How about making the four lead actresses, say, a nurse's aid, retail store cashier, house cleaner, and receptionist?
0321525655|5.0|I'm a Garr Reynolds devotee. I've done a lot of public speaking, but until recently never used slides (Powerpoint).  I bumbled thru my first couple of PowerPoint presentations with too many bullet points, too many busy graphs and then I stumbled on Garr's book, Presentation Zen, and his various blogs.     Wow! It takes much more work to be that simple, but the payback has been amazing. My audiences are finally *getting* and remembering what I'm trying to convey, and I am much more relaxed as a presenter.    As president of my Toastmasters Club, I recommend Presentation Zen to any member who wants to become more skillful with PowerPoint. But they have to buy their own copy; I don't lend mine out.

B001M4YZ90|4.0|There may be only a few surefire things when it comes to movie-going these days, but one of the surest is that, in any film written and directed by Guy Ritchie, your mind will have to race mighty fast just to keep up with all the characters and plot conniptions that will go speeding by you through the course of the story.<br /><br />His latest film, \\"RocknRolla\\" is clearly no exception to that rule.  The movie contains virtually all of the patented Ritchie trademarks familiar to us from such works as \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" and the truly incomprehensible \\"Snatch\\"  (though viewers should know that \\"RocknRolla\\" is nowhere near as complicated as that film).  Like those others, this movie is bursting at the seams with an assortment of colorful criminal types, flashes of wicked humor, sudden explosions of violence, pitch-perfect performances, a too-cool-for-school rock soundtrack, and whipsaw editing guaranteed to leave you with a serious crick in your neck by the time the experience is over.<br /><br />As usual, the criminals are culled from virtually every strata of London society, running the gamut from corrupt real estate moguls to two-bit henchmen who seem always to be one step away from being rubbed out themselves.  This latter group includes \\"300\\"'s Gerard Butler, Idris Elba (Stringer Bell in \\"The Wire\\") and Tom Hardy as a trio of crooks known affectionately around town as \\"The Wild Bunch.\\"  Tom Wilkinson is the high-stakes financier and local mob boss whose territory is being muscled into by a Russian real estate tycoon played by Karel Roden.  In addition, Thandie Newton appears as an icy-cool accountant who is risking all by playing both sides off one another; Toby Kebbell shows up as a rock star junkie who amazingly winds up holding most of the key cards in his hand; and Jeremy Piven rounds out the cast as one of a pair of record producers who gets dragged into the whole bloody business against his better judgment.  First-rate performances all.<br /><br />We're told that \\"RocknRoller\\" is only the first entry in what is intended to be a crime drama trilogy.  If that's the case, we await with baited breath the next two installments.hat \\"RocknRoller\\" is only the first entry in what is intended to be a crime drama trilogy.

031606792X|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews I am moved to write a very long post explaining why change is a good thing in literature. We can't always have the characters we love be in the same place doing the same thing all the time. We do not want stagnant!<br /><br />It is OK for Bella to grow, develope and come into her own. Why would you want it any other way?<br /><br />Since you have already read the book I cannot change your mind on how you feel right now, but I beg you to read it once more, this time with a fresh set of eyes and a new perspective. The writing is still wonderful and the changes might be drastic but that is how characters grow and come into their own!<br /><br />Please try it once more, come back to the Twilight Fold hahaha

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|The first thing that struck about this generous 2 disc offering was the choice of material. You could, of course, dip into the Dylan songbook and compose various 'Best Ofs' from 100 plus songs, such are his superior and prodigal gifts. For mine, this, beats any such previous compilations for tonal shifts, themes and interpretations. Inevitably, some artists inhabit and interpret the material more convincingly than others, but this too, is a matter of personal choice. For instance, I think Anthony and the Johnson's,'Heaven's Door' sounds quite brilliant in his inimitable style. Verlaine's, Cold Iron's Abound', is riveting, even chilling, in a way the only other and earlier recording I've heard is not. I could happily erase the version of, John Wesley Harding and without ticking through the remainder of the list, some are merely competent versions without bring much freshness to the table. But these are small quibbles to the greater merits which will get a lot of play.

0060541792|5.0|It is perfect!!  It was just what I was looking for.  Thank you so much!  When I was pregnant, the first gift I got was Goodnight Moon with bunny.  My son from 3 months on needed to hold it and turn the pages after we read it to him.  When my son was about 10 months old, he started chewing instead of just looking and destroyed the book.  I went to 3 different bookstores trying to find the book, but they all had the new version with the seal in the corner.  I started searching Amazon, but they too only had the seal version.  I saw the book with the nightlight, but I thought he wouldn't like the nightlight since he's just used to the hall light.  Since it had been 3 months since we read Goodnight Moon, I ordered it anyway.  The look on his face was worth the extra for the nightlight!  He got this big smile and squealed with delight.  He also does like the nightlight.  Thank you Amazon for giving my son his \\"old\\" Goodnight Moon back!!
B001H5X7I4|3.0|I missed seeing this in the theater and couldn't wait to acquire this for my own film library.  While the humor is typical, overblown, usually over-the-top Stiller, the hype about Downey's portrayal of a white man playing a black man is worth one's while.      I seem to malign Stiller's humor, but truly, he points up some of the most irritating American foibles and American weaknesses with great ability.  For instance, the complete lack of understanding of what's going on around them, the seemingly desperate need for substances to block out reality, the certainty of American importance and the silliness of celebrity--all are done to the max and rightly so.  I hazard to suspect that what is seen as humor is really a chastisement of our worst traits.  If one doesn't sit up and recognize these things, no one is paying attention or thinking very hard.  Probably the worst problem we have.    The excellent turn by Tom Cruise in this is priceless.  Probably the best thing he's done.  A tongue-in-cheek blast at himself.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|in the 20th and 21st centuries, he might well have written this story.  It's that kind of tale:  Unlikely underdog rises from despair due to pluck, perseverance and highly improbable coincidence.  And yet it works.    Make no bones; it's a dark-toned film in the early going, especially the first half hour or so.  You will see the kind of gut-wrenching, cruel beyond belief poverty and exploitation that will make you want to turn away.   I won't lie, 15 minutes into the movie if my friend had said, I'd like to go, I would have.  (But what a mistake that would have been!)  As usual, the ads may be misleading so if your tastes run to typical bollywood (or even hollywood) light-hearted & all feel-good, move along cause this ain't it.  I can understand how some viewers don't want to see the ugly reality of this young man's world, but I would also counter that we can't pretend it's not the way life is for some.     But that being said, if you will give the film the time it needs to tell this story, I think you might be sucked into Jamal's narrative, just as I was.    You might come to admire his resolve; his single-mindedness and the idea that he believes in the future -- not that he will be rich, mind you -- but that he will find the girl who is his destiny despite all of the things that keep pulling them apart.  Ultimately, his motivation is not the money, but doing right by the girl who was left behind.   As the layers unfold of how Jamal came to knows what he knows, I became as intrigued as the police captain who is interrogating him.      But beyond the love story, there's the equally compelling relationship of the two brothers.  Jamal's brother Salim alternately exploits, protects, and betrays him throughout the film as the story spans through their childhood, teenage, and young adult years.  They survive together and end up taking very different paths as young men.  But in the end, blood proves out.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|I am lucky enough to remember the earlier movie of The Women, and can compare this one with some degree of fairness.  The first thing one realizes is that movies today are better and the emotional freight is portrayed closer to reality than any of the movies of the contract studios ever were.  The encouragement with which the manicurist is enticed to divulge her secret is less catty than the earlier film, and the moment of understanding is more emotionally detached than the drama with which it was portrayed in the earlier film.  Detached in the sense that Ryan's character is stunned and in a traumatic funk rather than \\"the betrayed woman.\\"  Then she is angry.  I remember the earlier film and the corny betrayal distress that was the major theme of that film.  Ryan infuses her role with angry humor and strength rather than weak femininity.    I love seeing Meg Ryan in more mature roles now that she has gotten beyond the ingenue period.  Annette Bening is a superb foil as the close and angry friend.  A great cast.    I am also much pleased to see that women are protrayed more realistically.  During the days of the contract studios, almost all roles, especially women's roles, were  stereotyped and all too often the caliber of acting was far below what we can see today.  This movie has a great cast and its own restructuring of those roles to fit into todays lifestyles and concerns.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This quiet movie lacks the usual Hollywood hype of blood, guts, action and meaningless sex.  What it does have are two good actors who reveal the loneliness that sometimes creeps into everyone's life.  What better place to expose loneliness than in over-crowded, over-stimulated Tokyo! Living in Japan, I did smile at the goofy karaoke scenes...it is wildly popular here and the tv shows are equally crazy...what town doesn't have a worn out lounge singer trying to hang on by her fingernails? Unless you have wandered into a Japanese restaurant with a picture menu where each picture looks the same, you might not laugh.  The dizzying backdrop of the lights of Tokyo adds to the feeling of disconnect in the two main character's lives. The scenes at Kyoto's temples and shrines provided a momentary hush from the frantic pace of life...Who among us has not questioned our lives, our mates, our purpose in life at least once?  I liked the movie.  Parts made me laugh out loud. Parts of it made me pause and reflect.  I saw some of myself in these characters.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I can understand casting Kate Winslet (Heavenly Creatures, Sense And Sensibility, Titanic) in a love story, but Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, Dumb And Dumber, The Truman Show)?? All I could think of was his many years of insane comedic roles. Then, I heard that ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND had a sci-fi angle, and I figured it would have to be a total disaster. I was wrong. Winslet and Carrey's Clementine and Joel are absolutely endearing and believable. They go together like bread and butter, easily convincing me that these damaged characters truly love each other. The whole memory-erasure thing is well done and adds a nice, bizarre twist to the procedings. If you look at my reviews, you'll see very few love stories, but this one is a masterpiece of comedy, romance, and a completely off-kilter atmosphere. If you enjoy movies like SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE or 12 MONKEYS, and a bit of romance doesn't terrify you, then ESOTSM will satisfy. Highest recommendation...

I repaired point of sale systems at the time, and some of the diagnostics took thirty minutes or more to complete, leaving me with plenty of time to absorb large chunks of the book.    The plot itself is ridiculous in the extreme.  I doubt any one person would merit such a detailed and expensive relocation to keep them safe.  I think he would have simply been killed and dumped somewhere, kept in that prison till he died, or moved to a small town in Wisonsin and told to keep his mouth shut.    Plot threads are introduced, and than abandoned.  A menacing female Chinese assassin is mentioned and becomes a shadowy menace... but never even sees our main character.    It occurred to me that in order to give us such lavish descriptions of Italian locations and food, Mr. Grisham would have to travel there himself.  Merely picking up a handful of travel and cooking tomes from a bookstore would hardly suffice.  I'm sure that every night's stay in a villa, every plateful of fresh pasta, was carefully documented and dutifully charged against that year's income as legitimate \\"research expense\\" to fostor creation of this weighty novel.    I can picture an auditor gently approaching the author:  \\"Excuse me, what are you doing here in Italy, Mr. Grisham?\\"     \\"Rrmmmph\\" he replies.    \\"Excuse me?\\" The auditor asks again.    Finally swallowing his hearty mouthful of osso bucco, Grisham repeats, \\"research.\\"    \\"Ah,\\" the auditor replies.  \\"That expains it.\\"

B001PPLIFU|5.0|After reading Roger Ebert's review of QUANTUM OF SOLACE - the super-critic who gave this film a C rating - I had to determine whether or not I agreed. I didn't. To be sure, I watched this film four times.<br /><br /> Gone are the juvenile quips and the soundtrack jokes we came to identify with Roger Moore's interpretation of the Ian Fleming British agent (in his films, the producers descended to the level of using soundtrack themes of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and even CALIFORNIA GIRLS to provide \\"humor\\"). I like Roger Moore (in such serious films as THE WILD GEESE), but as James Bond he was the worst. Many times in his films, a character tells Bond that his reputation has preceded him. If this were the case (as Roger Moore himself remarked in an interview), what would his value be as a secret agent? Why not just give him a Batman costume (although THE DARK KNIGHT makes a Batman story more gritty and cruel than many Bond films)?<br /><br /> Pierce Brosnan was probably the second-worst Bond, followed by model George Lazenby. Unfortunately, Lazenby plays Bond in the longest (running time) and one of the best of the Bond stories. Fortunately, he only played 007 once.<br /><br />  Many people believe that Sean Connery was the best Bond ever. Yes, he was superb in DOCTOR NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. After GOLDFINGER, however, he became too cutsy with his remarks and the directors each became increasingly sloppy. THUNDERBALL has some horrible post-dubbing in a couple of the scenes. DIAMOND ARE FOREVER is so awful that it hardly deserves mention. Only NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN redeems Connery somewhat in a come-back role. He got rid of the one-liners and faced probably the best-acted villain ever, but he was saddled with a remake of THUNDERBALL for the story instead of something original.<br /><br />  Timothy Dalton was a bit slight in stature for the role, but he was probably the most believable 007. He was hampered with a few of the one-liner quips that Roger Moore loved to bring off as well as some Three Stooges antics (a car carrying a barn along on the ice, for example), but his serious take on the role was refreshing. It is unfortunate that he only made two of the 007 films because he was reportedly uncomfortable in the role, but his discomfort was not evident on the screen.<br /><br />  Daniel Craig re-writes the role of Bond as a comparatively unsophisticated, non-elitist, violent secret agent, an actor who might appear as comfortable in a car mechanic's work uniform as in a tuxedo. The producers Broccoli (Cubby's daughter) and Wilson evidently decided to start over with the franchise and re-envision Bond as a serious, relentless, emotionally damaged, and occasionally scar-faced 007. Gone are the horrible quips with double meanings, gone are the Q branch gimmicks (replaced by equally effective communication technology accessed by his versatile cell phone), and the romantic clinch endings. This Bond doesn't end up in bed with the very capable main heroine, although he does make a sheet sandwich with a tall but inexperienced British worker who gets the GOLDFINGER treatment with oil instead of gold paint. The only clich&eacute; here is that the secondary heroine is again iced after her bedtime exchange with Bond.<br /><br />  Craig does have an extended fight scene with the self-admitted nasty little villain, a scene during an oil fire that is inter-cut with a struggle between the heroine, Camille, and the sadistic dictator general who molested and killed her mother and sister. Craig doesn't really kill the villain as Bond usually does in a spectacular finale. He, in a sense, does something worse, and what Camille does to the general is more than women usually do to men with whom they are fighting. Kicking the villain in the groin is one thing (which she does do), but what she also does to him in the same area of his anatomy is hair-raising, daring, and appropriate in the revenge department.<br /><br />  PresentingQUANTUM OF SOLACE as a direct continuation of CASINO ROYALE is inspired. We have new heroines, but the Felix Leiter role, the arch-villain named White, and the misunderstood but forgiving Italian agent named Mathis continue as if the first film never ended. Forget the fact that this Bond is blond. Who cares? Don't you know that we blonds supposedly have more fun?  Although having more fun does not appear to be big on Daniel Craig's list.<br /><br />  If you want a cartoonish Bond who dispenses cheap laughs, go back and watch the Moore or Brosnan versions. If you want a tough Bond for a tough new age post 9-11, see Daniel Craig in CASINO ROYALE and its direct sequel QUANTUM OF SOLACE. He does not look like someone you would immediately identify as a suave secret agent, which is what makes him more effective than his predecessors.<br /><br />Dr. Charles J.

1402210086|5.0|Cotillion      I first met Georgette Heyer when I was about 12 or 13 and was asked to find a book for my mother to read.  I picked up \\"These Old Shades\\".  My mother enjoyed, enough that I became her most reliable selector of light fiction, and I, reading it afterwards was hooked.        For years I would borrow every one I could find in the library, from friends and snatch them up when seen in paperbook form.  Of course not all of them were up to the same standard.  But of all of them, \\"Cotillion\\" counts as one of my very favorites.      The heroine is not too old nor too young.  It is a bit of a Cinerella story, the girl is headstrong and meddling but utterly sincere.  It is however the hero who absolutely wins me over.  The anti-Romantic, a good antidote to all the stuff Walter Scott throws out (I remember that I did not care all that much for Young Lochinvar either), total self-knowledge, and complete generosity.  That's Freddy.        The plot is light as air and hilarious.  The timing is perfect.  And unlike the end of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" there is no bittersweet aftertaste.  Everyone is nicely matched.  Enjoy!
B001R3ZA4U|5.0|A mentor of mine some years ago, noted psychologist Erik H. Erikson, studied the stages relative to youth, identity, and crisis.  SMALLVILLE, in many ways, recapitulates the stages of human development across a spectrum of characters: Clark, Chloe, Lois, Lex, and an array of \\"outsider\\" characters as in outsider art.  With great special effects, a cast of characters who have been present for the most part for eight seasons, a clear season to season progression of growth via experimentation, exploration, growth, and in several characters, notably Lex, a regression to the shadow-self - SMALLVILLE is a fine study of conflicting emotions, judgement calls, life defining moments, and in Clark a deep conflict relative to the question of who he is to become in a human world in which he is more human in compassion than most humans yet not human in his core psyche: a Kryptonian, of course.  Now, the main negative I have observed with each season is the dulling effect on plot progression caused by Lana Lang mania on the part of Clark.  The plot is somewhat stalled in the Lana Lang hangup Clark has for her.  I'd much rather see a playful relationship between Clark and Lois.  On a positive now, SMALLVILLE is the first treatment of the Superman tradition that does not put clark in tights, a cape, and so on, all of which would make him look like a circus dropout!  Bottom line: If you enjoy epic superhero tales that you can view over eight seasons, a type of study of youth, identity, crisis, and growth to the rim of manhood and womanhood (Lois, Chloe, Lana, etc.) -- then give smallville a shot.  It's great action.  Each episode, especially on DVD or Unboxed, is theater quality.  I hope to see a ninth and tenth season, for there is so much material the show's writers can draw upon to make a current excellent SMALLVILLE into a great SMALLVILLE.
1932907009|5.0|I was pointed to Save the Cat by a writer in Toronto, Tassie Cameron (co-exec producer on CBS's FlashPoint). She told me the book was every working screenwriter's secret weapon.    She told me this after reading my Angie-award winning screenplay Albatross, co-written with my writing partner Lance Rucker. She had a couple of good suggestions for Albatross--nothing too major--but I took her advice and started right in reading Save the Cat and must say I'm finding it very useful.     Snyder spends a lot of time making you hone your concept, nailing it right to the floor. And he's right. You've got a have a 15 second \\"elevator pitch\\" or logline that gets the other guy salivating to know more. I realized that our logline for Albatross had all the elements he talked about, and I think that's why the story is working. But I also realized that the two other scripts I'm working on, which I think both have good, even great stories, have not been gelling. Until I can get to that core, they won't.    But I did have fun kicking around other ideas. Forcing myself to fit them into Snyder's criteria was helping me create ideas that had huge potential.    This book goes up on the shelf next to Robert McKee's Story, my other big \\"Ah ha!\\" book. Most of the rest were interesting but didn't really teach me all that much. And the $20k I spent on an MFA was basically a waste.     Want to learn how to write screenplays? I tell students and the inevitable callers and wanna-bes to make sure they are literate--if you don't read a LOT, and if you don't really CARE about the placement of the lowly comma, how can you expect to write? For that I suggest English Simplified by Blanche Ellsworth and John Higgins, everything you wanted to know about grammar, usage and punctuation in 100 pages. Then I tell them to read McKee. Now I'll tell them to read Synder, too.    Then write. Don't talk about it. Don't tell people you want to be a screenwriter. Write.

B001FBIPF0|3.0|A long time FOB fan I was excited to hear Folie a Deux when it got release. After listening to it several times I felt disappointed. My problem with the album is that it is like you're listening to two different albums. Half the tracks sounds like the FOB I know & love and the other is just different. Don't get me wrong I love it when artist experiment with their music but it can easily go good or bad. I feel like FOB had such a unique sound that just a few tweaks to their sound will be fine but it sounds like they did a complete overhaul for half the album.<br /><br />The album itself isn't bad it just depending on what vibe your feeling at the time a person can listen & enjoy the different sound but most the time I just skip them. I do give them props for the attempt for something new it still could've been ALOT worst but the songs most the time are just boring in my opinion. But the album as a whole isn't bad just disapponting in my own opinion but is decent album.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Buy this movie.  The other reviews will tell you why you need to watch this movie-- in fact, you have probably seen it already.  I'm going to tell you why you need to buy the dvd.    Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog was originally released on the internet in three 15 minute episodes that were available (briefly) for free and then on iTunes.  Why should you shell out eleven bucks for a dvd when you could just get the three episodes on iTunes for a dollar each?  Two reasons.    Reason number one: Commentary! the Musical is one of the bonus features, and is at least as funny as the film itself.  I am convinced it is funnier.  Including Commentary!, you get twice the music and 2.5 times the laughs for one low price.    Number two, you will want to share this with everyone you know, and it's just easier to show people a dvd than to crowd everyone around your computer.  Also, you can loan it to people and guilt them into watching it, or sneak it into your movie night rotation.  These techniques are useful in overcoming many peoples' inexplicable reluctance to watch musicals voluntarily.
B000VE439Y|5.0|If you've ever tried to compile a list of pure comedies that are also truly great examples of cinema, you'll know how hard it is. I get stuck at about three. I once flipped patiently through [[ASIN:0452289785 Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]] to see how many four star comedies I could find (I know - I'm a sad sack, aren't I) and don't recall seeing one more recent than Betty Davis' [[ASIN:B0012KSUTU All About Eve]] some time in the 1950s (though, it could cogently be argued, that says more about Leonard Maltin than it does about funny cinema).<br /><br />There are outstandingly brilliant funny films, like [[ASIN:B000B5XOWA Airplane!]] and [[ASIN:6305922756 This Is Spinal Tap]], that never transcend the string of loosely-themed set pieces that was their genesis and, whilst compulsory viewing, don't pretend to operate as real motion pictures (in fairness some of Christopher Guest's later output, and in particular [[ASIN:B0000ALFVD A Mighty Wind]], does). There are wonderful films that happen to be funny, and maybe even wonderful comedies that aren't all that funny.<br /><br />But Monty Python's Life of Brian, while it pulls you in with its homely premise and, true to Python form, plays out very much like a string of set pieces, effortlessly transcends its genre into timelessness and profundity. That it's still as challenging today as it was on release (for different, but not that different, reasons) is part of it, but that doesn't speak to the pure cinema of it. The closing scene, as classic a sketch as any Monty Python devised, isn't just a magical set piece, but is a bittersweet and timeless commentary on the absurdity of life and, to boot, a genuinely moving swansong for Monty Python itself (leaving aside the somewhat challenging existence, for this theory, of 1983's [[ASIN:B000A2UBNE The Meaning of Life]]). There are some transcendent moments in the history of cinema, and the cheerily whistling, toe-tapping routine of condemned men on crosses, pulling out to a twilight wide shot, is as superb as any of them.<br /><br />The sketches are of course brilliantly funny and all eminently, inevitably and annoyingly quotable by males of a certain age, but the underlying absurdities they point up, dearly held sacred cows all - the absurdity of stoning someone for saying Jehovah, the absurdity of political protesting for the principle of it, the wilful absurdity of \\"miraculous\\" explanations for innocent behaviour (says the hermit who has just accidentally broken a vow of silence,  Brian having trod on his foot: \\"I hadn't said a word in eighteen years until he came along\\". The crowd: \\"a miracle!\\"), and the sum total of all of this mayhem: the absurdity of life itself - are decisively executed and keenly observed. This is by no means wacky private schoolboy humour of no consequence: this is cutting social satire, and it is to all of our discredit that, nearly thirty years on, the motivated prurience of religious groups has barely abated.<br /><br />In the accompanying disk there is a terrific documentary charting the reception of this film on general release in 1979, which to us old dogs really doesn't seem that long ago, but on the strength of that documentary may as well have between before the Boer War.<br /><br />Well, in one sense. But when Terry Gilliam wonders out loud whether that film could get made today, and doubts it, you have to suspect he's right: the absurd objections of the  Mary Whitehouse brigade might not pass muster these days, but equally pernicious (and absurd) ones from other religions have taken their place. When we tolerate religion but don't tolerate free speech you do have to wonder. In any case, it is interesting to see footage in that documentary of the Pythons' famous BBC2 debate with Malcolm Muggeridge and the Bishop of Southwark, if for no other reason because it's rare chance to see the permanently-genial Michael Palin so worked up as to seem visibly to be restraining himself from lamping Malcolm Muggeridge.<br /><br />This \\"immaculate\\" pressing of the film didn't seem to be up to much for me - I was disappointed in the surround sound quality on the feature disk (I once owned a long player of the soundtrack, and remember the musical numbers being far crisper) and the bonus disc has little on it apart from the hour long making-of documentary, interesting though that was.<br /><br />Lastly, kudos to the late George Harrison, who apparently single-handedly financed the film when no-one else would (and, presumably, made a killing!) without whom we may still be living under the dark auspices of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association.<br /><br />OK, not that likely, but still.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonfilm didn't seem to be up to much for me - I was disappointed in the surround sound quality on the feature disk (I once owned a long player of the soundtrack, and remember the musical numbers being far crisper) and the bonus disc has little on it apart from the hour long making-of documentary, interesting though that was.

B0018CVQFM|4.0|Nash's influence goes well beyond the music. You could ask David Crosby and Jackson Browne just to name two....  This compilation is the best contextual view of the the man's music.

B0018QOIXU|3.0|Adele's debut album is a solid outing, a cohesive collection of some good songs and of course offering the interesting vocals of Adele.  The lead single \\"Chasing Pavements\\" clearly outshines all other tracks and unfortunately everything else seems to fall slightly flat by comparison.  Adele has a singular voice, however she has neither the ability nor the range at this time to hit some of the vocal gymnastics that she's aiming for and often comes across as overconfident.  I'm not sure that she's grown into her own voice entirely and some of her performances have too many affectations which can almost hit a level of annoyance.  I think of the magnificent Alison Moyet at times here, and Adele is certainly no Moyet...yet.  Another small problem with the album is the writing, which can jump from terrific to questionable.  Frankly I'm surprised that some of the tracks made the final cut.  All in all, Adele is an artist to watch, shows great promise, and this is an enjoyable if not slightly disappointing first effort.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I was surprised and impressed by this film.  Clint Eastwood has once again shown that he really can adapt to a huge variety of stories and still deliver a wonderful end product.  Why should I ever have doubted the man?  His list of achievements is now so significant that to doubt him is to err.<br /><br />In \\"Changeling\\", Eastwood tells the story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) who is a single mother bringing up a young boy in suburban Los Angeles in the late 1920s.  She returns home one day to find the boy missing.  She raises the matter with police who, after a number of months, claim that the boy has been found in rural Illinois.  However, upon being reunited with the child, she is shocked to learn that it is not her child.  She remonstrates with the authorities who fob her off with the line that she must be mistaken.  Of course, she doesn't take this lying down and continues to agitate.  The authorities eventually have her committed to an asylum as insane.  Not much due process here!<br /><br />Jolie is captivating as the mother.  She achieves the role magnificently.  John Malkovich as the crusading pastor trying to root out corruption in the LAPD is a revelation.  Malkovich is a very talented actor.  Yet, the real star is probably the director, Client Eastwood, who brought the film in under-budget but cut no corners.  The film truly hangs together well.<br /><br />My strong recommendation is to see this film.  A solid story has been brought to the silver screen by a man who seems to only get better with age.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|If you were fortunate enough to see the film DRUMLINE when it played in theaters you got to witness a telling coming of age story with a dynamic musical touch on a huge screen, complete with tricked out stereo no doubt. If you didn't, then take advantage of the recent blu-ray release of the title along with a wide screen HD television.<br /><br />For those who aren't aware of the story we have Nick Cannon as Devin Myles, a young high school graduate and a showboat with dreams of playing drums in a college marching band. He gets the chance when he the director of a band at a southern college, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones) recruits him to help kick their drum line up a notch. Having come in second place for some time, Dr. Lee needs a win to retain his job.<br /><br />Devon shows to school with enough arrogance to fill the field. He has yet to learn the basics of earning your place and feels he deserves it. Conflicts with his section leader, Sean (Leonard Roberts) present a ton of tension for the better part of the film. But as in most movie stories, it ends in a mutual respect.<br /><br />Along the way to the final showdown, the BET Nationals, Devon finds time to have a romance as well as develop into a man. He is revealed to having a problem reading music that is solved. And he learns that respect is earned and not presented on a silver platter.<br /><br />Sound simple? Actually it is. The underdog, rising to the challenge is a standard in movies and has been for years. What makes this one stand out among the rest are two things: the engaging performances by all involved and the thrill of the competition that ends with a drum off between the two rival bands.<br /><br />One of the nicest things to see here is black actors playing something other than criminals, hip hop stars or drug pushers. Instead we see the characters as real people and not stereotypes. With the exception that the film takes place at a mostly black college, the roles could have been played by any race. First and foremost we have a story here to tell.<br /><br />Cannon shines as the smart aleck upstart who thinks the world revolves around him. His Devon smiles and preens but when revealed that he has problems sulks until he gets the chance to improve. Roberts as his first foe and later friend provides enough of a big brother attitude to try and whip him into shape that the character is believable. Outstanding is Jones, an actor who deserves more parts than he seems to get, as the director who wants his students to realize that there is history in the music he chooses rather than simply victory over the other college.<br /><br />The competition is an amazing thing to watch, even more so if you've ever been in marching band or taken an interest in it. The precision and skills observed make this a moment to enjoy for all. Want to know who wins? Then watch the movie.<br /><br />So what makes this movie so special that it deserves blu-ray status?

1582701709|5.0|Anyone who has provided a negative review of this, apparently sees life through a paper towel cardboard tube.  Once you read this little book you will start to see things in a different light, and while there will be certain people trying to find flaws in it, being as critical as they are; you'll begin to see them as what I refer to as \\"nay-sayers\\".  Their negative thought process does not serve them.  Call it a self help book, call it an awakening, call it a way of life, whatever you call it, the book will call to you.  I had told my brother about this book and while he was at a house party of a friend, of a friend of his.  He explicitly described a drawing force pulling his attention down to look underneath a coffee table he was sitting at, and once he answered this summoning feeling, when he looked he saw this little book underneath the coffee table, skimmed some pages and was in awe.  He asked the host of the party about the book, the host replied it was his girlfriend's and she reads it everyday.  It seems that if you were to read it everyday, it acts a constant reminder of the good, which can be easily obstructed by the day-to-day grind.  For a few bucks you can pick this book up and bring a lunch that day instead of going out for it somewhere, borrow it from the library, borrow it from a friend, it's something really special.

This movie feels like it is getting you dizzy with all the moving of the camera.  I think that whoever made this movie needs to do a better job next time.  Don't waste your time and money on this item.  You will be disappointed.

When I speak about the Watchmen with friends who read literature, they gasp and look at me with horror.  How could anyone read a \\"comic book\\"?  It's a graphic novel, I protest.  The few I've been able to convince to read the book have been duly impressed.<br /><br />Of all the books I've read in my life, Watchmen stands out in the top few.  It is a powerful book on many levels, and something any fiction reader should have in their collection!

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Definitely carried by the strength of the actors and some intelligence of the dialogue, but in the end the story melts away like an icicle.  Once again Woody shows his lack of skill in writing overly dramatic material.  More dissapointing, in the end it's fairly misagynistic on women as all three either self-destruct or wander aimlessly thru life.  A brief hand full of comic moments douse the emotional banality of the story.  I enjoyed the spanish locale as a twist of the allen discography, but that ultimately didn't save this lemon.
6304698682|3.0|Shot on location in Sun Valley, Idaho, and to some esteem to \\"Shane,\\" \\"Pale Rider\\" succeeded with sweeping landscapes and magnificent cinematography, to be an interesting Western that helps to bring back something from Eastwood's mystique...<br /><br />In 1850 California, a small group squatters and their families find themselves terrorized by Coy LaHood (Richard Dysart), who are standing win the way of his progress... Desperate, LaHood begins using violence in an unsuccessful attempt to run the peaceful yet determined homesteaders from their land... Leading the homesteaders is a decent man Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty), who dreams of a better life for himself, his girlfriend Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress) and her lovely daughter from a previous marriage, 14-year-old Meagan (Sydney Penny).<br /><br />Into the lives of these strong-willed people rides a mysterious man--tall and lean with something strange in his eyes --known only as \\"The Preacher\\" (Clint Eastwood). He says little, divulges nothing of his past, but for a man wearing a clerical collar he seems an expert at handling weapons... He pulls the miners together and gives them the confidence to defy LaHood even in the face of mounting violence...<br /><br />Although both Sarah and her daughter become enamored of the pale preacher, he gently rejects their advances and makes them see that Hull is a less capable but far better man... There is a good scene when Spider Conway--went into town alone and running out of steam--invited LaHood to come out and have a drink with him... But instead Stockburn and his deputies came out asking him to dance...<br /><br />Richard Dysart creates an all-too-believable villain, and Western veteran John Russell is well-cast as a middle-aged mercenary and his hired guns to face a legendary hero... It's an old score and it's time settle it...
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|This is a rather odd film, a bit choppy but with beautiful scenery and imaginative writing.  The work by child actress Catinca is exquisite.  It is difficult to see where the director is headed or how there is a cohesive storyline, but it is a great work on storytelling itself, and the difference between the thoughts of teller and listener, between artist and viewer.  Should art be viewed primarily through artist's intentions, or rather is it what the viewer gets out of it?<br /><br />But what I want to particularly highlight, especially on the approach of the 200th birthday of Darwin this week, and the 150th anniversary of the publishing of [[ASIN:0451529065 The Origin Of Species]], is the character of Darwin in this film.  Yes, he is actually a character, a scientist to the last, but also an adventurer and a key member of the band of bandits.  Accompanying him is his monkey Wallace, named after the oft-neglected [[ASIN:B000R6XT50 cofounder of the Theory of Evolution]].  For those familiar with the history of the beginnings of the theory, it gives nothing away to say there is a particularly amusing moment when Darwin confesses to his monkey that he stole the whole idea of the theory from Wallace, and he will make the legacy right.
1416955070|3.0|Depending upon what you are looking for, this book is OK. It is not original; is awfully cliche; and is ridiculous in places, BUT, if you need something to read that will entertain, and you keep your expectations to a minimum, this book fits the bill. It reminded me of an amateur Harry Potter. I am going to read Book 2, tho.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I can only assume the critics who attacked this film were familiar only with the director's Hollywood work, and not his European films or those of the writer of this amazing story about Jews in Holland at the end of the war, and the Dutch resistance.<br /><br />I have no idea who the actress is who plays the lead, but she gives a bravura performance that carries the film.  She is riveting, charming, cunning, beautiful, a survivor and one of the strongest female film protagonists of recent memory.  The script is dynamite, historically accurate by my amateur measure yet with twists and turns that constantly keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I strongly recommend listening to Paul's director commentary, which gives dimension and gravity to a film that deserved much better attention here in the States.  If this film was released in 2008 -- with a different director attached -- it surely would have been hailed as one of the finest films of the year, if not of the entire suddenly vogue genre of Holocaust movies.

031606792X|3.0|I just finished this book, and I'm not sure what I think, to be honest.  I could write a long review as others did (some of them excellent), but there was one thing of many that I can single out as bugging me the most about Breaking Dawn. Toward the end, there is a big gathering of vampires from all over the world.  Obviously they have to eat.  Yet \\"vegetarian\\" Vampire Bella was no more than SLIGHTLY uncomfortable with the fact that all of the family's vampire visitors were out murdering humans.     But I guess I should feel better because the vampires were told to stay away from Forks and La Push...so they could only go murder people further away.  This is all in the name of Bella protecting HER vampire family.  What about the human victims and their family members, dying and suffering as a result of the Cullen's vampire-fest (designed to save their own butts?)  I know, I know, they're VAMPIRES, and they would be killing people in their own countries...but Bella's acceptance and attitude bugged me to distraction.  I don't know how the author could have avoided it - maybe have Dr. Cullen get some more of that blood bank stuff he had such free access to earlier in the book?  Seemed like an obvious solution to me...    Anyway, that part was so hypocritical, and so not Bella.  The new Vampire Bella was a complete stranger, maybe that's part of my irritation with it all...
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|An excruciating bore. I did not even wish to give this a one star rating. Such talented actors as Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine must have been ashamed to be a part of such tedium, or should be. Prior to viewing this film, I was subjected to all of the pseudo-hype concerning Heath Ledger's performance and I was left numb by its absurdity. More to the point, are we certain it was absolutely him? I say this because he looked and sounded more like Al Franken. The voice he contrived was a dead-ringer for Mr. Franken's which was a tad confusing. Mr. Ledger's performance can't compete in the slightest with that of Jack Nicholson's superb turn in the role of \\"The Joker\\"! Then there was the incredibly ugly and talentless Maggie Gyllenhaal as the love interest. After such exquisitely beautiful talented actresses such as Kim Basinger and Michele Pfeiffer in the previous \\"Batman\\" films, and the lovely and talented Katie Holmes, it was disturbing to be subjected to such all round ugliness. Anyone who thinks Ms. Gyllenhaal could possibly be desirous to \\"Batman\\" or \\"District Attorney Harvey Dent\\" (Aaron Eckhart) is simply reaching. At times, even she appeared to realize she was totally miscast. Watching her attempt to maneuver around in an evening gown was one of the few hilarious moments of relief. Were there no beautiful and talented actresses available for this role? I can think of five (5) off the top of my head, why couldn't the producers and casting directors? One of the most grating aspects of Christian Bale's characterization of \\"Batman\\" was at times he sounded as if \\"Batman\\" had been cross-bred with \\"Darth Vader\\" or that the latter was doing a cameo. I can only hope that the next outing of \\"Batman\\" is much better than this. A film for diehard \\"Batman\\" fans only.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell is a really good writer. The first two paragraphs in Outliers will confirm that. As with his other best sellers - [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] and [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]], this is an enjoyable read that leaves you wondering. Wondering if his thesis is correct.<br /><br />The thesis he promulgates in Outliers is that successful people are the \\"beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies ... It makes a difference where we grew up.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell then shows us how a number of successful people were shaped by their environment and the ability to practice their art. His suggestion that you achieve success only after 10,000 hours of practice means that as a motivational humorist and keynote speaker and author of [[ASIN:0976374005 Why Ireland Never Invaded America]] I have a few more hours to go!<br /><br />That Gladwell justifies his theory related to his chosen group of successful people goes without saying, but I'm not sure if the message is relevant in general. Sure you have to practice your art like crazy and sure, you have to have the facilities to practice the art. Tell me something new.<br /><br />The book is positioned to suggest you can predict success. The most interesting aspect though is his absolutely fascinating chapter on Korean Air which is basically about predicting failure. In the case of Korean Air, catastrophic and consistent failure. The Korean deference to authority figure - where first officers in the cockpit deferred to the captain - contributed to a number of Korean Air disasters. Interestingly, Gladwell suggests that you are less likely to have a plane crash if the first officer is flying than the captain! The logic being that the first officer will immediately defer to a comment from the captain in times of emergency whereas the opposite is not necessarily correct. I loved this chapter and I enjoyed the rest of the book, but it is not a book that goes on my Best of Gladwell - that is [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] which I try to read at the start of every year. Outliers is an easy, enjoyable read, but one full of generalizations and assumptions, but the man is such a good story teller with an easy writing style, it is worth reading.but it is not a book that goes on my Best of Gladwell - that is [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] which I try to read at the start of every year.

B000UTZ510|5.0|The soundtrack from the indy film \\"Once\\" is one to treasure.  The film is a little jewel, an utterly convincing and moving story of two struggling Dublin musicians, played by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Both stars are multi-talented singer-song writers whose distinctive, pure voices deliver moving lyrics and memorable melodies in solos and duets. I recommend the cd highly; it is one of my all-time favorites. Catch this memorable film; savor the soundtrack.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I thought I would address the question that bothered me most, is it worth rebuying Cars in Blu-ray?  I ran my dvd version, side by side with my Blu-ray, alternating scene by scene, on a Visio HD 1080p 42 inch monitor.  I even upscaled the dvd to 1080p on a fine upscaling Phillips dvd player.  The whole family commented on the difference.  The complete picture was just sharper with much more detail visible.  For example, in the racing scenes you could actually make out the cars in the seats in the speedway!  The desert landscape detail was just fantastic all the way out to the horizon.  I was sceptical.  I had resisted buying any animation on Blu-ray, but I thought I would give one a try.  As far as Cars is concerned, anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not sure Blu-ray is worth the list price, but if you can get it at a substantial discount (like at Amazon), I would say you won't be disappointed.

0553293397|5.0|A couple of admissions first - This is my first review.  This was the first Asimov book I've read.  I enjoy older (50's/60's) science fiction - no profanity, good character development, fairly predictable, but with interesting ideas and ways of looking at human life.    That said, I picked up The Naked Sun at a used bookstore not knowing that it was part of a series.  I read a couple reviews that complained that the first 50 pages were used to get the new reader up to speed and decided I'd take the risk and read it anyway.  I am so glad that I did.  I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a day and a half of intermittent reading.  It's basically a classic 1950s style crime novel.  Yes, it was a little predictable, but so what.  I really enjoyed the interplay of the characters and way Asimov made the idiosyncrasies of the Solarians equal those of the earthmen.    Not groundbreaking, but a fantastic quick read.  I highly recommend it.

B001PPLIEQ|3.0|Even now I can't fully describe just how or why Quantum of Solace is an \\"inferior\\" Bond film, save for a fact that it seems to put more emphasis on one chase sequence or another in a gritty sort of way that would almost seem to step into the empty-headed vomit-inducing-camera-shaking of a \\"spy thriller\\" like the Bourne Identity, and yet manages to maintain its own identity (no pun) as a Bond film of this \\"new\\" Bond era.<br /><br />The main prevailing error or issue in the film is the seemingly gaping disconnect between two plotlines that run throughout the movie. The micro-story of Bond wanting revenge on -someone- (not even really explained who) over Vesper's problems leading to her self-sacrificing suicide, and the fear by M and MI6 that Bond is letting his emotions destroy his subtlety and skill as an agent, and instead opt to barrel through enemies aimlessly and kill anyone he wants (spoiler alert: he doesn't do any of that).<br /><br />While we are probably supposed to believe that Bond is driven to stopping Dominic Green (Matthieu Amalric) in whatever his dastardly plan with Bolivia is, the key issue here is that the two plotlines have almost no connection whatsoever, and that Vesper's sacrifice seemingly has nothing to do with Quantum or its schemes. I say \\"seemingly\\" because the movie very clearly shows the opposite, but does not show exactly HOW she has to do with Quantum's schemes. She's just an opaque plothole that may or may not be a red herring. Bond shows absolutely no emotion over her save for a few minor scenes, usually involving Mathis or Camille, of which there are not nearly enough of these to give any justification of this sense of a need for revenge.<br /><br />At no point in time is it ever explicitly explained or mentioned just why Bond is so \\"devoted\\" to stopping Dominic Green beyond the fact that it's his assignment to do so. Very early on it is revealed that he, along with Mr. White and countless others from big-name diplomats to nameless henchmen, are part of a secret organization devoted to -something- (not even really explained what). The only memorable line about Quantum is Mr. White joking to the degree of \\"Here we are afraid to say too much over the phone thinking the CIA and MI6 are listening in on every word when you don't even know we exist!\\"<br /><br />Aside from the seeming infiltration of people on almost every level in every organization criminal and political, in an almost sort of Illuminati sort of way, Quantum really does nothing but remain a nameless cloud over which it apathetically watches things happen and occasionally puts its own people out of their misery when they are on the brink of death and/or about to reveal too much about them or break them out of the situation. Even Mr. White gets away alive and unpunished.<br /><br />Dominic Green also appears to be so completely out of his element that everything about him just screams \\"nameless minion\\" from the beginning. He doesn't even seem to be sane, as he constantly fills the screen with bug-eyed expressions of frozen-stupid, like a mix of Barty Grouch Jr. in Harry Potter, and Grima Wormtongue in Lord of the Rings, only without as much to do. The only time Green appears remotely human is when he gives a speech or talks with a Bolivian general, in which in either case it seems clear that he's been prepped with a pre-written speech or protocol by other members of Quantum.<br /><br />Dominic's entire hare-brained scheme is also another dangling plot-hole in the making that never really seems important even though the entire movie is focused on it; it first throws off the viewer into thinking it involves exploiting untapped oil resources in a Bolivian desert, then is later revealed that there is no oil there, and that Green's plan is little more than to dam up the underwater aquifers in Bolivia and force a drought on the country, before literally pulling out and doing the same elsewhere while the international community deals with Bolivia's problems. There's nothing else in the plan aside from that, and I fail to see any conceivable way that this would make any lasting money beyond a few millions made screwing investors out of oil and pipeline money.<br /><br />Green proves on multiple occasions to be just as dumb and incompetent as a campy Bond villain of old, most memorably in which he is leaving an opera with a group of investors, and catches Bond in a hallway, after an earlier scene in which he ordered Bond to be killed. Not only does Green freeze up and stare at Bond for what feels like 30 seconds, but he proceeds to do absolutely nothing to stop him short of sending only two guards to have a shootout with him which obviously fails.<br /><br />What is then left in the film is a piece of poor exposition tied around multiple action sequences that ultimately have a sense of confusion attached to them. What is most stunning is how Casino Royale had viewers on the edge of their seat with the mere action of a POKER GAME and yet the colossal boat chases and roof-top acrobatics and down-hill car-flipping chases have people on the back of their seats, placidly staring and wondering what is happening, why it's happening, and when Bond will do something 007-y instead of just being a generic pawn in a gigantic action sequence that could just as easily be slipped into a bland straight-to-DVD movie without much trouble.<br /><br />In totality, there's barely half a movie here, with enough explosions and guns and fighting to fill in the rest for time, making it the shortest Bond movie, but nowhere near the worst, as the -potential- storylines set up for future entries are good enough on their own to not be a total failure.he plan aside from that, and I fail to see any conceivable way that this would make any lasting money beyond a few millions made screwing investors out of oil and pipeline money.

0743201140|5.0|The main message is: discover your strengths and focus on them. The most common thing to do, and totally widespread, is to fix your weaknesses rather than focus on improving your strengths. And this is what this book shows that it's wrong. I realized that myself recently, what draw me to this book that confirmed my experiences. Each individual is unique, what is wonderful, and we need to accept this fact - starting with ourselves. We will not excel at everything we do, and one of the reasons is that this is hard-wired in our brains during our growth process. Forget about review process and review sessions with your manager who point your improvement areas. Or better, work around them, as they cannot be roadblockers, but don't worry if you never become as good as other people. You and I have talents that can be improved and lead to fantastic strengths when combined with knowledge and skills. This is what can lead you to your success.

After all, this is not an action movie.  The majority of the this movie is about the story and story telling.  Morgan Freeman, well what can you say, he is simply one of the best actors of our time.  His narrative on this movie is equally as good.  Tim Robbins did an equally outstanding job.  The whole cast is right on.  Amazon is great to deal with for movies and seems to always have the best price.  Service is great too.  They are good to deal with.
B00004TWZF|4.0|I watched this movie back in the 80s, when I used to work in a video store, because I love dolphins and saw one on the cover.  It's definately different, but in a good way.  It is slow in a few spots, but overall a good movie.  I normally can't stand Rosanna Arquette, but can watch this movie over and over again because of the story and great scenery/photography.  Also, Jean Reno is always good as a villain and it's great to see him before he became known in the States.
B000063TS9|3.0|Well, the music here doesn't (apart from some intriguing touches) sound very much like Shostakovich. Nor does it sound very much like jazz either - one would be excused for suspecting that that Shostakovich's access to jazz music might have been rather limited, and the music here certainly suggests so. In short, this is a rather curious disc of light music, but a mildly enjoyable one nonetheless.    The first Jazz suite is a minor work. There are some nice tunes there, but it is seriously short on genuine inspiration and displays none of the wit of some of Shostakovich's other work in the light genre (and virtually no jazz influence either, as already mentioned). Now, the so-called Jazz suite no. 2 isn't really Jazz suite no. 2 either (that one was lost during WWII), but really the Suite no. 1 for Variety Stage Orchestra. The booklet lays out the story behind it, but the title is still misleading. It was composed in the 1930s, or rather compiled from his film-score tunes and is a slight work in all respects - even though it too sports some nice, hummable tunes - obviously written with no other inspiration than the impending payment. The orchestration of Youmans's Tea for Two, Tahiti Trot, adds a modicum of dark wit, but isn't anything one would want to hear more than once.    The music for the ballet The Bolt is in another league altogether. Yes, it is also \\"light music\\" (but there is a serious, dark undercurrent to it), and several of the numbers are based on popular music styles, but this drunkenly boisterous and sometimes razor sharp music leaves a strong impression and is by far the best work on the disc.    The Russian State SO under Yablonsky plays well, and adds swagger and wit to the music. Sound quality is clear and sufficiently spacious (critics might claim it is a little too close). Unfortunately, in the Bolt these players are in the end really no match for Järvi on DG. As for the rest, well, this constitutes a mildly interesting and enjoyable disc, onethat deserves to be heard once. But it is far from any mandatory purchase

031606792X|1.0|The title says it all.  In the last book, the Cullens seem like the Brady Bunch--they don't drink, smoke, swear, kill people, etc., but they DO visit with family, celebrate Christmas, arrange flowers, arm-wrestle, decorate, etc.  These X-MEN super powers that they all have--even though these \\"gifts\\" are supposed to be rare--are rampant and ridiculous.  There's nothing exciting about it.  A vampire who can control wind, rain, the weather?  Sound like Storm to you?  Very anticlimactic and not menacing at all.  The saga died here.  The first 3 books had me expecting a lot more.
B000000OAC|5.0|I was always attracted to Queen's earlier work as it was heavier than when they \\"became famous.\\" Don't get me wrong, as I still like their pop hits, but I much prefer their heavier stuff. I think this was their last heavy album before they went full-bore pop.<br /><br />The thing is that this is mostly a mellow album. It starts heavy with Rock You and Champions, then starts to fade into a very mellow middle. Sheer Heart Attack is sort of heavy, but is sometimes hard to follow. Right at the end, things pick up again then drop down into mellow with the final cut.<br /><br />These aren't so much complaints as just descriptions of what is going on here. I still like the album. I like it more because outside of the first two songs, it is not a commercial undertaking. The songs are not the catchy pop tunes they are so famous for. That scores points in my book.<br /><br />If you like Queen, I don't even have to describe this album, but for those of you that have never heard any of their full albums, this is a good place to start. Highly recommended.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|If you haven't purchased LOST season 4 yet, just spend the money already; and while you have the credit card out get the first three seasons on DVD as well.  LOST never disappoints and especially so in season 4. Trust me, buy season 4, drink the kool-ade and follow me.
0765348276|4.0|If you enjoy Heinlein, you'll enjoy this.    If you worship Heinlein and denegrate anything that reminds you of him, you'll not like this.    It's not great, but it's certainly a very good and worthwhile reading.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Somehow, this movie embues mechanical, limited movement and speech beings with emotions, compassion, and hope, to say nothing of love.  A genuine tour d force, the viewers come to really care about the characters and their fates.  Pretty good for a basically square box on treads and a floating egg.  Oh---and it contains one heckuva message!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved all the books in this series and could not put them down.  The final saga was a great ending and I enjoyed getting to know all of the characters.  Not just for teens.  It is a new and modern favorite of mine right up there with W. Heights.
B001EO748M|5.0|I enjoyed the second season even more than the first! It focuses more on the historical aspects and despite the fact that I clearly knew Anne Boleyn's fate, I couldn't stop watching to see how everything unfolded.  I really like the constant change that happens with this show- the characters continually evolve and since Henry VIII keeps killing people...well, the cast is ever changing.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Anyone who loves Jane Austin types of movies will love this one!  Elizabeth Gaskell is awesome. Get Wives & Daughters as well as North & South by her, too.  Love it!
B00000258P|4.0|not the first album you would normally buy as a pink floyd fan. of course every album has its own identity. but if you dig on the sheep or dogs, you have graduated to new levels of fanbase.
B001JRB16U|1.0|Simple as that! Disney is squeezing the final teet here and milking the masses for another, \\"Gotta Own\\" DVD. I won't buy this until the Blu-Ray comes out.
0525951113|5.0|for book,  Daemon  The only bad part is that I keep thinking about this book whenever I see a story about more technology.  Fro example, in todays paper about Google being able to access everywhere you go on line and all your contacts and all your private (no longer) info so that they can send you targeted ads on your cell.      Anyway, read this book for fun and games.  Its worth it!  I bought 2 copies one for each of my gaming grandsons.  One of whom has not gotten his copy yet!  I couldn't let it go without reading it myself.  I liked it and I don't play computer games!

1904920209|5.0|I went to Richard's bread 101 course and bought \\"Dough\\" immediately. This is a fantasic book which sets everything out clearly and consisely. In the past by bread was always inconsistent. Now it is near perfect! And the children always look forward to baking days!     This book and DVD is a must for any bread baking entusiast, no matter how experienced or not you may be. You will quickly get used to the no knead approach and you will never, ever look back.     I have no hesitation in recommending this. Buy it!
031606792X|4.0|When I ordered the book I was expecting it to come within 3-7 days and I got it the next day after purchasing it on Amazon.com  Very impressive!
B00023BLXK|5.0|I received this movie in good condition and it was shipped to me very promptly.  I thought the movie was excellent and just what the review said it would be.  I will order from this sellar again and I would recommend him to everyone.
B000HIVOI2|2.0|I have to first say I am a huge Stargate fan, so I jumped at the chance to own it on blu-ray. However, I was not at all impressed with the quality of the picture. Some of the effects they did seem to improve for the blu-ray disc, but many of the scenes were still very grainy like they are in the DVD version. Some might say this is because the film is old, but I also own the Rambo movies on blu-ray and the quality is superb...you can see all the beads of sweat on his head. Obviously, Rambo is also an old movie that they managed to restore to blu-ray quality, so why not Stargate? If I had known what the quality was like before I bought it, I would have passed and kept my DVD version.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|I was hearing more and more about this game \\"Settlers of Catan\\" from my family and finally decided to utilze part of my winter break learning the game and then teaching others.  It's steaped in strategy, diplomacy and loads of fun.  My only caution is that you don't have liquids around because one good spill could ruin the \\"puzzle material\\" pieces that make up the board.  This is a definite game to put on your list to learn - takes a little effort upfront but start playing and you'll catch on quickly and have loads of fun playing it and lots of fun with your friends.

B000003S09|5.0|Compared to the rest of King Crimson's vast collection of releases, this one stands out as thier most emotionally moving and darkest releases. starting off with the bizzare jazz-fusion tune \\"21st Century Schiziod Man\\" King Crimson take you on a journey into a bleak and dark world that perfectly reflects the albums artwork. It's probably the mellowest release they put out, but even songs like \\"Moonchild\\" manage to evoke a melancholy that no other release of thiers possesses. Another thing to notice is Greg Lake's amazing vocal performance. His vocals actually play a vital role in what makes this a great album (just check out \\"Epitaph\\" for clear evidence of this) Later Crimson releases tend to focus on instrumentals. In fact the instrumentals tend to be better then the songs with vocals, which have since become too humorous for my tastes. So if you are new to this band, here is where you should start.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|Guns N' Roses - Welcome to the Videos (Keep Case) by Guns N' Roses   excellent!
B00005A46T|5.0|I previously had a review on here that ended up going awry, I got mad half way thru it and started ranting on All Hope Is Gone and how bad it sux. I felt stupid because I already did it once. So here's a better one (not to satisfy the poser that voted my review unhelpful mind you).       This album is fu**ing amazing. It's darker than the first, I wouldn't say heavier or angrier but definitley darker. Great technical work on the drums by Joey, especially on Disasterpiece which is in my opinion the best song on the album. Corey's last stand as an amazing vocalist, and the last album Clown had hardly anything to do with. Ironic, but that's as far as I'll go. Overall, if you like the 1st album then get this one.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I must've bought this for the kids some time ago. I think they like it. As long as it's suitable materials, then that's fine by me.

2352500796|5.0|For the second time, Henri-Paul Enjames has made a major contribution to the world of identifying and the collecting of American WWII militaria.  Volume 2 of the GI Collector's Guide adds to and expands the categories of equipment identified in the first volume.  More emphasis has been placed upon ephemera, those paper items intended for short time use, under Army Publications and Other Printed Material.  We find sections on publications and paper items of all kinds.  The section on Personal Items has been expanded, as well as Sports & Recreation.  A section on American POW's has been added, along with new sections on Camp Life, the Wartime Draft and Training Camps.  Significant additions to Volume One's Uniforms, Mountain Troops, Female Personnel and the Medical Department have been made.  Other sections; Weapons, Armored Forces and Airborne Troops have new additions.  Of particular interest is the expansion of the equipment used by Army Chaplains.  Here we find published photos of rare and difficult to find items used by Chaplains to hold services in the field for all three denominations.  It goes without saying that this volume is essential for the library of the serious collector.  The color photography is unequaled and the list price is very reasonable.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This album is one of if not the angriest and aggressive metal albums ever but it's not the typical song-with-no-direction-just-play-as-fast-as-you-can-and-scream-like-you're-being-cornholed-by-a-can-of-juicy juice crap. THIS IS REAL METAL ! THEIR NEW STUFF AND NEWER METAL DOES NOT COMPARE IN ANY WAY ! Raw..angry..fast..real.....and sorely missed.....
B00030590I|4.0|I bought this because I couldn't find it anywhere else at the time and didn't want to wait to see it. It was alright, nothing to write home about. In hindsight, I guess I could've waited to rent it.
0670020745|5.0|Everyone should read this book, not only for all the incredible info about the brain, but also as an insight into family illnesses.  Jill Bolte is a real survivor.  Thank you.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Honestly, I'm not an REM fan. Think they are often frustrating to listen to and think that they are often the darlings of the critics to their detriment. However, I think this album is very good (lousy cover). It is a short blast of modern rock infused with cool technology from Jacknife Lee (who worked with U2 on Atomic Bomb). He brings a fresh approach and energy that shines through.    No more navel gazing for these guys. It is the second REM album in my collection. The first is Adventures in Hi-fi. This one could the considered and extension of that gem.    Good job guys!

B00005JPS8|5.0|This is one of the better comic book to movie titles out there. DVD arrived in great time and condition.
B00005JPO1|4.0|Is Crystal Skull better than Raiders? Never. Is it an entertaining Indiana Jones movie? Definitely.  It wasn't perfect (why did I only choose four stars instead of five? Shia), but all the other movies have elements to them that I don't love (the entire of Temple of Doom being a prime example). Otherwise, this installment is my second favorite of all the Indy movies.  And, I can't believe that no one else has mentioned how hot Igor Jijikine is. Dovchenko was a great henchman. ;D
B000063V8S|5.0|DVD was in perfect condition and I am enjoy them to the fullest!  Thanks
B0017MO10U|3.0|A fun addition to the Stargate mythos, but not much more than an elongated episode. I saw no reason for this to be a movie. It isn't a good buy for anyone except those collecting the entire series. Or fans of Ben Browder. He's dreamy!
B00004STDN|1.0|From the beginning where the belt buckle is obviously sawed almost in half the movie just goes down hill.
1594201927|1.0|I have watched Nial Ferguson's documentary on the subject in question and I think that the man is everything but an economic historian. To begin with, he is incapable of describing the origin of money as a commodity that grows in a society into a medium of exchange. Historically, money has always been a commodity and it is important therefore to make a comparison with our current worldwide FIAT money system.  Also, Nial is an historian, not an economist and he is unable to explain the causes and origins of business cycles that have led to the destruction of countless fiat paper money, starting in China where paper money was born.    Overall, Nial is a good story teller but his book cannot be appraised in today's crisis nor does he provide a solution to our current inflationary tendencies.   For anyone truly seeking to understand monetary history, I would recommend Murray Rothbard and Jesus Manuel de soto's works. Nial is obviously a statist lacking the depth of real fundamental economics.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|This movie is a great vehicle for the Blu-Ray format.  I had seen this movie on regular DVD at home on our HD television.  I immediately ordered a copy in the Blu-Ray format to play in our PS3 system.  The difference in quality  was very impressive and this format made the movie much more fun to watch.  Very enjoyable movie and an awesome display of Blu-Rays quality.
140120841X|3.0|Perhaps I just grew up in a different age, but Alan Moore's work does not resonate with me. Perhaps it is because I have seen the fruits of the tree he and others planted in the comic garden, but some of the concepts seem a little silly for the serious issues of the work. It is still an interesting story and belongs in any graphic novel library but it may not age as well as other of Moore's work.

I'd like to hear her stretch her voice a bit more, as she sometimes gets a little too relaxed. Overall, though, this is definitely a good disc and I look forward to hearing more from this amazing artist.

B0013ND30M|5.0|I grew up in a time Fairy Tales were the stuff of every little girl's dreams... I grew up almost every day with Sleeping beauty.    Although I prefer (visually) the older, grittier version, It's great that Disney has taken the step to preserve this masterpiece of color for the new generation of watchers.    Personally, there are only a handful of real Disney treasures. And their color, attention to detail, and depth is beyond perfect. In the world of mass production, Disney's creations today has become a flat and somewhat monotonistic in color and depth. So nothing will beat the meticulous art that have been poured to Disney Classics such as Sleeping Beauty, Snow white, Pinocchio, Lady & the Tramp, and Little Mermaid ^_^    Still. This 2-disk edition is a very good tribute.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Remember the old [[ASIN:B00007JMD8 Journey to the Center of the Earth]] movie, with the optically enlarged lizards presented as dinosaurs (colloquially termed \\"slurpasaurs\\")?  That was what passed for a nifty special effect in 1959.  Today it's 3-D effects.<br /><br />Of course, audiences of today are far too sophisticated to fall for lizards with horns and fins glued to them; in the age of movies like [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park]], only a digitally animated Gigantosaurus will do.<br /><br />This latest incarnation of Journey is surprisingly true to its [[ASIN:1402743378 roots]]: Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is an absent-minded volcanologist who is spending ten days with his nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson).  Trevor's brother and Sean's father Max disappeared a decade before looking for the center of the Earth.  Max left behind sensors that detect geological shifts in the Earth's crust and a cryptic series of notes in a Jules Verne novel (guess which one?). When one of the sensors fails in Iceland, Trevor decides to go on an adventure in 1950s fashion, bringing along his plucky nephew for the ride.<br /><br />Accompanying Trevor and Sean is the fetching Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Antia Briem), the daughter of another volcanologist and the only person with any spelunking skill whatsoever.  While checking on the device, lightning strikes, our heroes dive for cover, and from there it's a lot of falling, screaming, and running.<br /><br />This is a 3-D movie, which means that at various times and for no reason whatsoever, something flies straight at the screen.  Since you will likely not have invested in the expensive 3-D glasses and you may not have even had the good sense to rent the 3-D version, this makes the movie seem even dumber than it is.<br /><br />The other surprise is that despite the dinosaurs and the hottie, this movie is aimed at a younger set.  The dialogue isn't very good, although Fraser does his best.  Sean is meant to be a wisecracking preteen modern hero, but he reverts quickly to type.  Scenes that are meant to be scary are played up for laughs: giant venus flytraps get pummeled in wrestling-style fashion, flying killer fish get batted away like softball practice, and there's a long and pointless mine cart sequence whose sole purpose is to show off the 3-D effects of the glasses you didn't buy.<br /><br />Did I mention the irritating glow-in-the-dark mascot?  There's a bird.  It follows Sean around.  Only he can understand it.  And it glows in the dark.<br /><br />Ultimately, Journey is more an amusement park ride than it is an actual movie. Because amusement park standards are much more family-friendly, Journey to the Center of the Earth is heavy on the Journey, light in the Center.Scenes that are meant to be scary are played up for laughs: giant venus flytraps get pummeled in wrestling-style fashion, flying killer fish get batted away like softball practice, and there's a long and pointless mine cart sequence whose sole purpose is to show off the 3-D effects of the glasses you didn't buy.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|Please take a minute to check out the logitech forum to get real user feedback on this device.  The packaging states that the device features a analogue stick, but it does not.  There is a thread about this at thier site.  The product is otherwise very nice and designed well. But I bought this for the whole package and when logitech releases a crippled device that has no better features than the n52te I can not give it a low enough review.  I will gladly revise my review when they release a fix for this.  Misleading advertising is just not cool.<br /><br />EDIT:  Yes this was fixed, no more issues with the stick  Sorry for the delay commenters, lots to do, not much time to edit!  And for the record, the n52te is crap, so are it's rebrands.  No fanboy here.  However I would like to point out that the product was still misrepresented to LOYAL logitech buyers who bought this product for the advertised features.  Upgrading the firmware MONTHS after launching a product to make it work properly is not doing right by your customers.  So this thing sat for a long time as a paperweight, meanwhile I bought the Logitech F710 wireless controller for pc, which worked as described right out of the box.  I never really got to know the G13 becasue it was DOA, but maybe I will find the time to rekindle that fire, and see what this nice looking hardware can do.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is a beautiful and dark film.  I think it takes the vampire genre in an entirely new direction.  It doesn't try to depict vampires as pretty or wise.  There's a definite sadness behind the brutality.  Eli \\"lives\\" a very bleak existence with her campanion.  It makes you wonder if Oskar will just end up the same way.  Their friendship is sweet and appears genuine, but there's just enough doubt about her motives to make you think twice.  He definitely loves her.  At the end I wished it was longer so you could see what happens next.  This is a great film about love and friendship and...vampires.  I highly recommend it.

While possibly not the best film ever, it is definitely the movie those of us who grew up with The Omega Man were waiting for. A worthy tribute to the original.  This Ultimate Edition is a must for the serious Omega Man/ I am Legend fan.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell argues that the American ideal of independent success against all odds is a myth.  Success is the result of a perfect combination of time, place, and culture.  People who succeed despite great adversity often have hidden advantages.  Some negative societal forces can actually serve as advantages in the right place and time.    This is a book full of fascinating ideas, and Gladwell keeps them accessible and interesting by using humor, concise examples, and everyday language.  Now I want to read his previous books as well.

0618918248|4.0|I am an unpopular monist. This is the view that consciousness is an organic whole comprising all aspects of reality. This view is contrasted with the popular monist, or materialist, but must also be distinguished from the solipsist who ignores the evidence that other consciousnesses exist and that these other consciousnesses contribute significantly to their own reality.<br /><br />In this context I have some suggestions for improvements to Richard's arguments based on my beliefs about the utility of religion, the facts of which are demonstrated at:<br /><br />http://kengelhart.home.igc.org/religion.htm<br /><br />If anyone is interested in my ideas I would be glad to describe them.<br /><br />EVOLUTION OF GESTALT<br /><br />Dawkins makes the important point that our beliefs evolve in the form of a gestalt. He also makes the point that some in the culture are, what you might call, behind the curve, lagging behind the characteristics of the gestalt. In the terms of a normal curve, we can speculate that the gestalt is the normal part, where outliers on the leading edge are pulling the curve into the future, and outliers on the trailing edge are holding the curve in the past. Speculatively, this is a process resulting in the evolution of the gestalt.<br /><br />Dawkins' complaint is about the population on the trailing edge who hold the entire curve in a state of obsolete thinking. When he asks \\"what are these people THINKING?\\" we might answer, \\"they are hypostatizing their beliefs.\\" They are refusing to allow the evolution of their own beliefs plus those of everybody else, except the innovators.<br /><br />All of my suggestions to Dawkins regarding his criticism of religion fall into the category of asking for a more charitable understanding of those who are caught in the trailing edge of the gestalt. Clearly Dawkins is on the leading edge, but the other components of the curve also have useful functions. Also, others are further out on the curve than he is. Acknowledging his own tendency to hypostatize (we all do it) could make him more forgiving of this failure in others.<br /><br />I completely agree with Dawkins assessment of the undesirable side effects of organized religions. However, I want to see the gestalt evolve as quickly as possible. Using the best possible arguments is crucial to ordinary people understanding the issue and making personal decisions about what they believe.<br /><br />THE SIN OF HYPOSTATIZATION<br /><br />Uncompromising hypostatizers are not easily convinced of the error of their ways. They fall into the same category as the \\"cosmos-revolves-around-the-earth\\" crowd. Convinced that they and only they have a valid perspective on the world, they attempt to destroy other views rather than understand them. They are purveyors of dogma and enemies of new ideas.<br /><br />Dawkins imagines no religion., September 19, 2006 By G. Merritt (http://www.amazon.com/review/RHKZEK73JB ... ZEK73JB0FS)<br />\\"As a scientist,\\" Richard Dawkins writes, \\"I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise.\\"<br /><br />Because I do not have the book at my fingertips, I am using a quote from the most favorable review posted at the referenced site. In this quotation, Dawkins implies the absolute reality of the abstract ideas: scientist, fundamentalist religion, scientific enterprise. When I say implies I mean he uses these ideas as expressed in words as if every reader's reality must be the same as his. This is a very common and natural form of hypostatizing. However, Dawkins acknowledges in no way that these purported \\"things\\" are structures of ideas and beliefs making scientific enterprise no different in this respect than fundamentalist religion. Yes, the two realities are different, but what makes one of them better than the other? In my terms, one is closed to other realities where the other is open to other realities. Realists must acknowledge the existence of multiple realities and show how they are resolved. As I have already mentioned, this is an unpopular perspective.<br /><br />THE VIRTUES OF CHARITABILITY<br /><br />Dawkins tells the story of Wittgenstein wondering why people believed the Sun went around the Earth. His friend says it's because it looks like the Sun goes around the Earth. Wittgenstein makes the point that it looks just the same to believe the Earth is rotating. Wittgenstein makes the point in a glib way that implies the Earth-centrists are ignorant or, worse, stupid. The Big W seems to think that Sun-centrism is self-evident and ignores evidence the Earth people feel is important, like, the Earth obviously is stable beneath our feet and, anybody can see that if the Earth were rotating everything would fly off. Maybe the Big W knows better than to be influenced by this evidence but he is insensitive to the logic that underlies the Earth people's reality. Both perspectives here are seeing the same facts; they are interpreting them differently. Nothing is \\"wrong\\" with the Ptolemaic system. It is just highly inefficient in descriptive and explanatory power. Plus, the world's religion at the time, in that place, depended on it.<br /><br />Dawkins himself gets into a similar situation when he confronts a hypothetical religious apologist for NOM (non-overlapping magisteria, I am dropping the A because I see no function for it). NOM can be illustrated by the kid addicted to Grand Theft Auto (GTA). For most kids, GTA and real life are NOM. Those who believe these systems are integrated are easily identified. GTA cannot be mastered while thinking of it as just a game. One has to actually live it at the microsecond level. The kid on GTA can be likened to the Catholic priest who has to get up early in the morning, brush his teeth, put on his socks, eat breakfast, and then go conduct Mass. Religious ritual is not real life, but it is just as real as real life and those who are adept at it can shift back and forth just as easily as from high to low gear.<br /><br />I have to say, in my opinion, those who are comfortable with NOM have to have developed a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance. The contradictions in their realities do not call out to them to be resolved. It is like a person with a multiple personality disorder. I personally am not good with NOM, and I would speculate that Dawkins shares this characteristic. I am totally with Dawkins when he insists that religious claims cannot be beyond the realm of science. But I resolve the problem by believing that ideas that are unsupported by evidence have a crucial role in science. They are the stuff that fills the gaps in our systemic understanding of the universe.<br /><br />Arrogance about the absoluteness of one's own beliefs is no more attractive for a scientist than it is for a religious fanatic. It is just as important for the scientist to recognize the function of unsupported belief as it is for the fanatic to recognize the function of evolving interpretation of evidence. This is, in both cases, a matter of charity.<br /><br />THE QUALITY OF MERCY<br /><br />\\"[W]e do pray for mercy; /And that same prayer doth teach us all to render/The deeds of mercy.\\"- William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I.<br /><br />Mercy is an ideal, hardly ever practically realized. A rational person in our age must show the intent to be merciful or can expect no mercy. I want people who read Dawkins to be merciful to him because I believe in his mission and want it to proceed. However, he seems to expect his esteemed position in one context to protect him from destruction in the broader context. I am not sure this strategy will make the lasting impression I would hope for. This doubt on my part is what motivates the suggestions I make here.<br /><br />Henry Chu, in a recent interview (1), asks him, \\"Do you see any redeeming values in religion or a belief in God?\\" Dawkins answers, \\"I don't think there's any general reason, any logical pathway, that goes from being religious to being good. . .\\"<br /><br />I think that Dawkins does not answer the question. He has argued successfully that religion is not, according to the evidence, the source of the \\"good.\\" But he has not offered any speculation as to where morals do come from. In this same interview he alludes to philosophy transcending religion and being the possible source of universal rules of conduct. That would be a useful direction for investigation, but he might be out of his element and into philosophy.<br /><br />Moral conduct is not the only way religious beliefs can be justified. Dawkins addresses a few of these but always from the perspective of a biologist rather than a philosopher, where I believe the best speculations lie. In particular, his perspective does not offer him the standpoint to consider beliefs unsupported by evidence as essential for the operation of rational thought. I believe if he were more open to the possibilities and less obsessed with what his peers accept as \\"scientific rationalism\\" his views would be more effective.<br /><br />http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld ... 4830.story<br /><br />THE MAKING OF MODELS<br /><br />Dawkins says things sometimes that make me think he may know more than he is letting on. He may hesitate to make claims that would frighten many of his loyal followers. Hostility they can understand and accept but weird claims about the nature of reality or such could make many people discard his book, and his ideas, in disgust. However, he may incorporate short bursts of code that let other readers know there is something else going on. Having no large group of followers myself, I have no hesitation about making weird claims that would disgust the ordinary reader. Since the followers of this forum are not ordinary, I am sure they would not discard Dawkins just because I have outed him.<br /><br />Dawkins obviously accepts there are beliefs that are not religious. This is a slippery slope since true beliefs would be based on evidence. I project this position to a claim that all knowledge is belief, so we can just drop the idea of knowledge. I would go further to suggest that belief constitutes reality. Reality is our beliefs, some of it based on evidence, some of it not. Going even further, the part that is not based on evidence is what we call religion.<br /><br />Dawkins is consistent in using the term \\"religion\\" to refer to those categories of belief that are called that popularly: widely recognized, formally organized systems having many active members. This definition does not exhaust the possibilities for belief that is not based on widely accepted evidence. Scientists frequently share hypotheses with each other where evidence is inconclusive. Sometimes it is only a matter of interpretation whether any evidence exists at all. Where scientists may be aggressively pursuing every avenue to find supporting evidence for their hypotheses, these same people may have other vague speculations they know may never be supported by evidence. Like, what was the composition of the universe at the moment of the Big Bang? In my mind, this kind of speculation and the beliefs it engenders constitutes religion.<br /><br />What is not religion is what we refer to as \\"organized religion.\\" These are simply commercialized systems of dogma, promoted for the benefit of their \\"gurus.\\" People who believe this stuff simply have nothing else more important to believe in. People who have more important things to believe in do not believe them. This may seem harsh, or even hostile, but that's the way I see it.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Delusion\\" Dawkins makes another very controversial claim concerning consciousness functioning as a modeling context. Perhaps he hopes that most of his readers will never get this far. He speculates that the purpose of the organism determines the structure of the models they create. Now, we know that an organism's purpose will be highly oriented toward the opportunities in its environment, so that is precisely what the structure that grows in its consciousness depicts.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|I have all of his cd's and by far this is the best.  It has a vast array of music types and the jazzy style he throws into the mix is impeccable.  Don't hesitate buying this, you won't be disappointed!
B000PC6A3E|4.0|No problems here very good blu-ray rip. Great film if you get this get the dark knight too
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is such a great series where the second season took an already great show and turned it into a masterpiece. Michael Hall does an amazing job of pulling his audience into his mind to see and understand his dark urges being funneled against the scum of Miami. We now live in a day where hardened criminals are continually set free by liberal judges with the assistance of greedy attorneys while leaving torment and destruction in their paths. Dexter works hard to nullify the unjust city of Miami by following the strict code his step father used to control his murderous urges. I would highly recommend watching Season 2 so long as you have already seen Season 1.
1400063515|1.0|Terrible book! I've read a little statistics and cognitive science so, I was enthusiastic about this book when I first heard of it. I tried to get into it but found it so poorly written that I abandoned it. For me, this is rare. I usually just put something aside and tell myself, I'll get back to it. Here, however, no interest. Then, I heard Naill Ferguson praise the book  so, I figured I'd make a second attempt. Taleb's facts are pertinent and accurate but, his style and interpretation is akin to juvenilia. Ferguson's poor judgement here confirmed for me a growing suspicion that he too is more air than intellect.

B00000JXZ7|5.0|Chung during Decca era is my favorite musician. She combines dramatic flair with delicate feminism and often displays soaring spirit in her playing. And these qualities are abundant in this recording. Everything feels so right, you are just left to enjoy the music. There is a certain breathing-like natural quality in her playing here.    A beautifully long drawn introduction, to such a rapturously played second movement which shows Chung's wondrously imaginative fantasy, to an athletic finale make this version an absolute winner and Kempe's accompaniment seamlessly blends with the soloist. Royal Philharmonic plays with searing passion.     On my original LP the projected sound is tender, complimenting the interpretation. After several versions of transfer, Decca finally got it right on this Legend series and the sound matches the LP's and retains its delicacy.    Scottish Fantasy is also fantastically played and is a top recommendation. The accompanying Mendelssohn is a worthwhile addition.

0143039431|4.0|This story truly captures the Depression Era. My grandparents grew up during the Depression and I heard many stories about that time in their life. Ironically, my grandmother read this book and did not like it because of the language. Steinbeck's writing could be a little gritty, but I thought that it gave the story some character. The end is truly a shocker and I will never forget it for the rest of my life.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|This is perhaps Bruce at his best, offering some great lyrics backed by musical statement and power.  The first track, \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" was totally unexpected as it is a western ballad packaged as rock; the feeling and power was akin to watching the western movie \\"Young Guns\\" (remember?) which had a rock soundtrack (best analogy I can offer to describe it).  It is like Springsteen has nonchalantly tossed a new niche genre of music into the scene.  The experience continues with a great second track, \\"My Lucky Day,\\" and Springsteen has flawlessly arranged all of the tunes, taking the listener on a perfect series of mood transitions, straight to the end.      The DVD that is included with this CD gives some very interesting shots of Springsteen producing music.  You get an opportunity to witness how the artist arrives at the studio, disheveled, with his lyrics scribbled on sheets of notebook paper, and then sets to work synchronizing drums, guitars, clever inflections of voice, and other tools in his creative arsenal.  Absolutely worth the money I paid.  Nearly every song is a winner, and that is a rare thing these days.
B000071K5L|5.0|This book is, to say the least, an American classic. It captures the innocence of childhood, the simplicity of times gone by, the struggle of small town life during racial tensions, and so much more. The story is uncomplicated, straight forward, and heartfelt. It will always be one of my favorite stories.

B001J53X9U|5.0|the greatest movie of all time, it the best of the best.  will the next \\"batman\\" beat the box office, what do u think
031606792X|1.0|I got this book as part of the box set, but I am reviewing this book alone because it's the only one I have a strong opinion about.  To start, I am in my 30's -- I picked up the set because a number of my grown-up friends had become \\"Twilighters\\" and I had to find out what was consuming them.  I went in expecting to be entertained, if not challenged, and hopefully to find a series as engrossing as the Harry Potter books.  The first book did draw me in, but while I plowed through all four books in a weekend, I almost didn't bother to finish the fourth.    Why?  It was a mess!  Throughout the book, I kept wondering, surely, it'll get better...and it never did.  Honestly, my first thought after putting the book down was, \\"did anyone edit this?\\"    {spoilers to follow}    From the beginning, I kept waiting for a dramatic plot twist to bring some tension to the impending nuptials between Bella and Edward -- after the tortuous angst and bizarre love triangle from books 2 & 3, it was a tremendous letdown that the wedding was given such short shrift.  Where was the delicious build-up?  And where Twilight made me remember the butterflies of all those Firsts (the first touch, the first kiss, the first I Love You), I was shocked that the biggest First was over in scarcely a page.  OK, I get that this is a book aimed at young adults, but as the previous books showed, there is a lot of sensuality in words and kissing, and the author just sped past that as well.  By contrast, the gruesome birth scene was described in cringe-inducing detail -- which just exposes the inconsistencies in how our society deals with sex vs. gore.  But I digress.    Not to belabor the point that others have already raised, the desciptions of Bella's newborn life just made me groan.  Perfect mother, perfect child, perfect looks, perfect husband, perfect little cottage, perfect impulse control, perfect super powers...she even ended up with a perfect (albeit icky) resolution of the Jacob love triangle.  Igot so bored with reading about her effortless transition to her vampire life, I literally put the book down and resolved not to read any more.  Not because I wasn't rooting for Bella and Edward -- I definitely was -- but if that's all there is, why do I need to read about it for 300 more pages?  And what was the point of the previous books and the foundation that they laid about the inevitable loss of one's soul, humanity, and community when a person becomes a vampire?  I wanted to see some internal conflict, some growth, some tension, some sacrifice, and didn't get it in Breaking Dawn.  I can't even get into how inconsistently the characters had to act in order for the book to achieve this ridiculous level of \\"happily ever after.\\"    In the end, I picked it up again so I could just say I'd finished the book, but was even more disappointed with the conclusion.  I had to slog through the tedious introductions of a couple dozen new vampires, only to later discover they were all completely superfluous because of Bella's Incredible Love Shield and the convenient discovery of Nahuel, the mysterious vampire half-breed that Alice found just in the nick of time.  With that, the nasty Volturi just walks away.  So much for the vast number of witnesses brought in from around the world and the werewolf alliance that was cultivated over two books.  Was there ever a bigger literary build up for less payoff?     This book was an opportunity wasted.  I didn't love Eclipse, but at least it set up some very interesting questions for the last book:  would they actually marry?  Could Bella go through with the transformation, or would she realize the price was too high?  If she did, what would she have to give up?  Could they really live happily ever after?  The book could have dealt with just those questions, and it would have been perfect.  This series, after all, became a sensation for the love story at the heart of it all.  Instead, we get a book that puts the epic love story between Bella and Edward in the background, and throws in a ridiculous birth story, brings back Jacob from what should have been a permanent self-imposed exile, and ends with a standoff with the Volturi and a cast of dozens of vampire extras that just fizzles away.  The book takes on way too much pointless crap and the story that anyone really cared about got lost.  I can't remember ever being so disappointed at the end of a book.
0385340990|5.0|So alive are the characters in this work of fiction that it's difficult to keep in mind that these characters only exist on the pages of the novel.  (And yes! You will find out how to make Potatoe Peel Pie!)<br /><br />It came as a surprise to me to learn that the Channel Islands were, in fact, occupied by the Germans during WWII.  The time line of the story is just after the end of the war.  However, much of the deprevations, abuses, etc. that occurred during the occupation are mentioned in the correspondence that eventually ensues between the main character and the members of the literary society.  Depressing it is NOT !!!! Lively it most certainly is - as are the endearing characters.<br /><br />Imagine having a bundle of treasured letters from old friends carefully tied together with a ribbon.  Visualize yourself taking that packet of letters and curling up in your favorite chair or on the couch.  Slowly and with anticipation you untie the ribbon, select a letter.  As you  begin to read you are no longer alone; the friend who wrote the letter is sitting there with you telling what is in her or his letter.<br /><br />How many books have you read that gave you that feeling and sense of personal communication?<br /><br />A wonderful, delightful, thoughtful, and personal book.<br /><br />Highly, highly, highly recommended!!!  : )
B0007TKNII|4.0|This is a gorgeously shot film that stays more or less faithful to Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production.  The changes to the plot are minor (a few key events happen at different points in the movie, but it doesn't harm things), as far as I could tell... my main recollection of the stage production is from the double CD original cast recording.  In most regards the film is terrific - the visuals are stunning, the screen play is dead on and the production is fabulous.      In my estimation, where the film falters a bit is on the casting of the main roles.      The one exception to this is Emmy Rossum, who is just about perfectly cast as Christine.  Her vocal performance is every bit as good as Sarah Brightman's and she simply looks ravishing.  No wonder that both the Phantom and Raul are swooning over her.      But in my opinion, Gerard Butler is miscast as the Phantom.  For me, personally, I didn't need to see Michael Crawford reprise his role.  On the other hand, I think that a better performer could have been found to play the Phantom.  While Butler's acting is fine, I was never under the impression that the Phantom was supposed to be a gorgeous hunk in all respects save for a small blemish on one side of his face.  Unfortunately, that's what Butler's Phantom is.  In addition, vocally Butler barely holds his own.  One gets the impression that the role is just a stretch for his level of talent and training.  Although he did sort of grow on me as the film went on, he seemed completely overmatched in the Phantom's first vocal number of the film (the self-titled duet with Christine).  From there he did get better but I never felt that vocally he was really up to the level that the role deserved.      The actor who plays Raul gives an unmemorable performance.  There's nothing wrong with it, but again, I feel that a better performer could have been found for this role.    Most of the supporting players are fine - Madame Giri, Meg, and Carlotta are all good - Carlotta especially - Mini Driver straddles the line between giving a good performance and an over-the-top performance with skill.      In any case, I highly recommend this movie.  Those who are familiar with Phantom will not be disappointed and those who aren't will be pleasantly surprised.
B00005JPSM|1.0|Good cinematography. Meandering script. Very unlike-able main character. What are we supposed to care about? A child is in grief. But oh! There's an uptight gal in need of a lusty man in a truck. Hmm! It doesn't help that Zeta is such a bland, bad actress. From the opening monologue until the end, she's cardboard. Also bad for Zeta -- the fact that she's upstaged in every scene she shares with Breslin.

1554072840|5.0|Michael J. Mazza and Terri Ferro said it just perfect, this is a fun book for little people. My grandson, now 3.7, and my granddaughter 21 months; neither one had any trouble understanding what a \\"chamberpot\\" is. It's a potty!!     But they love saying, \\"NO, it isn't a...\\" and then they laugh. The illustrations are colorful, bright, and child-friendly. This is the one book they have me read over and over. We have the 'boy' and we're getting the 'girl' version.    More importantly with my grandson, one week he was still in diapers and the next...why the next he was potty trained!! He's into \\"BIG\\" boy underwear all the time now. What it basically emphasizes is when your child is ready, the next part of the journey in growing up will come.    I think it is great little book, worth far more than all the volumes written on potty-training a child on the market today. I have already recommended it to several friends, and will continue to do so.
0751529818|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie  Book Review        In the book Tuesdays with Morrie, I believe that the author, Mitch Albom, tries to make you, the reader, see life in a different light. He also shows how a long friendship and a great friend is crucial when it comes to getting through life and ending life on a good note.     Albom, a sports columnist, has written many books and ironically most of them are more about life than sports. In Tuesdays with Morrie, dives deep into the heart of life and the lessons that go along with it. He explains many different tools needed to get through life in a successful manner including: Not letting regret hold one back from achieving their goal in life, the act of forgiveness and why it is important, and also, how remorse can affect someone's life exponentially in a positive way.     In this book, Albom paints a stellar image in your head about friendship and companionship, which was probably his goal while writing this book. Albom also explains the idea of modern day workers and how they get too caught up in work and lose time for the important things in life; such as, family and friends. When it comes down to it, I think that Mitch accomplished his goals and somewhat exceeded them in a way because his language and word choice was so deep and passionate that the emotion almost oozed out of the pages and into the mind of the reader.       The strengths that Mitch Albom showed in this book were very clear. His first and most important strength was connecting with the reader because all of his lessons in each chapter were meaningful in some way, shape, or form. Another strength he showed was the art of keeping the reader second guessing. For example, most knew that Morrie was going to die at some point, but when? The only down spot about this book was the beginning because Albom flashed back to his college years frequently, which can confuse the reader at times. I would recommend this book to any type of reader because this book covers so many different areas. The only people I would not recommend this book to is people who are very uptight about death and the details of death.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video and used it once using the easiest setting and it was pretty tough, but not so tough that you couldn't do it.  It definitely got your heart going and I was a little sore the next couple days from some of the exercises.  It was easy to follow the instructions.  Soon after I bought it I found out I was pregnant and wanted to take things easy.  I think this will be a great video to use after the baby is born to get back into shape.

0312383320|2.0|Stephanie Plum is back in her first full-length Between-the-Numbers novel. Her FTA is Martin Munch. Diesel assists her with Munch as he is looking for Wulf Grimoire. Lula also attempts to help, however she's has personal problems of her own: planning her wedding to Tank, one of Ranger's men.    Honestly, I'm not sure what to think about this book. I guess I've expected more from this series. By now, I think Stephanie would know how to effectively capture a FTA. I feel as though I'm reading the same plot book after book. I understand Stephanie Plum is a comical cozy series, if you will, however the situations Stephanie finds herself in is just over the top.    I liked Carl the monkey, however giving people the finger got old for me around page 22. At times, I forgot about the other characters. Stephanie's parents and grandmother have a few appearances in the novel. Morelli is allowing his brother to crash at his place because his wife kicked him out. Ranger comes to rescue Stephanie from tricky situations. Other than that, they're hardly mentioned at all. This books really centers around Stephanie and Diesel.    I only recommend this book if you want to stay current with the series, however I wouldn't rush out to buy it. Hopefully book 15 will be better.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years, but I loved watching it again. Great blast from the past!
1416562591|4.0|Arvind Adiga's first novel is a well written and short read that is an excellent first person commentary on modern Indian society. What makes it so believable is the fact that its an Indian writer, who is very well rooted with the ins and outs of the Indian society.    The optimist in me enjoyed the book a lot, just like I enjoyed the movie Slumdog millionaire. Both in their own way celebrate the success  of the survivor. While some may question the protogonist's morality in achieving this success, the author through that sidenote on the hit and run incident towards the end, shows his compassionate and human side. The commentary here is not so much as to the state of affairs in modern India, but how adept people have become at surviving and thriving in these situations. There is a lesson to be learned here. India is a country of survivors and fighters. If they had to go through hell and back to get to where they are now, imagine what they can do now they have the power.    The short length of the book is definitely a point against this book, especially the last chapter seemed like a rushed job, as if the author had run out of words.     All in all a good read, and a nice complement to this year's blockbuster.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|...In my humble opinion at the very least. It's a bold statement indeed, particularly because everyone has their own opinion on what the greatest is. That said, no single album has ever had such an impact on me as this one did.<br /><br />Amon Amarth already was building their musical capabilities first with \\"Versus the World\\" and then even more-so on their intense \\"Fate of Norns\\" but here is where the intensity meets melody and beauty head-on.<br /><br />The album is chock-full of metaphors, wonderful melodies (particularly in vocalist Johan Hegg, who's growls are a lot clearer and refined but still maintain their sound of brutality) and viking legends. It's much less death metal than viking anthems of old. One could almost imagine the vikings of old listening to this. The music itself captures the feeling very well.<br /><br />I found not a single song on the album to be bad, with at mostly different times every song is better than the rest, though the weakest tends to be \\"Under the Northern Star,\\" yet even that manages to stay strong.<br /><br />It is immensely difficult to describe each song individually, especially when they all share so many traits. Even minus the death metal style vocals, the music is well-crafted and could potentially be well-received in circles beyond the genre. The lyrics, rife with metaphors and Norse legends, seem intense and violent. But consider the day and age back then, take the lyrics in that context, and put into modern context. Stand strong, ride the storm, never give up. It's a theme anyone with a little insight can learn and take away from.<br /><br />The bonus disc is wonderful as well. The two Wacken recordings are great. \\"Death In Fire,\\" particularly is as brutal as ever. The demos sound like merely the album cuts but with poorer production values, which is in places better musically and for tried and true death and black metal fans. The last two tracks may very well be two of the bands first recordings, released here for the first time. \\"Once Sent From The Golden Fall\\" is much like the title track of the album by the same name, but again, with poorer production, and \\"Return Of The Gods\\" is made in much the same vein.<br /><br />All in all, words fail me every time I listen to this album.

B000VNMMR0|3.0|In the opening minutes of this movie there is a gun fight combined with explosions that was so loud I instinctively turned the volume down on my television so it wouldn't bother my neighbors.  This gunfight lasts for quite awhile.  At the end of the gunfight our heroes go driving off.  At no point in all of this does a single other policeman show up nor are there even sirens heard in the distance and the neighborhood seems to take the massive explosion that destroys an entire apartment very much in stride.<br />At this point I said to myself, \\"All righty. So this movie is going to be stupid. I'll watch it anyway.\\"<br />And I did.  And it was. But having switched off the complaining/rational part of my brain early on it actually turned out to be kind of fun.  In this world everyone can survive thirty foot drops as long as they bounce off a lot of things during their fall, computer hackers are ridiculously sexy women who also know kung fu and I'm not even going to tell you what jet planes can do.<br />But it was somehow less awful than a lot of recent action movies.<br />On a final note, there was absolutely NO reason for this to be a Die Hard movie outside of marketing purposes. Except for one minor reference to the original where an FBI Agent introduces himself as Agent Johnson causing Bruce Willis to grimace, there were basically no connections to the original that weren't forced and tacked on.<br />Still, for some reason I smiled more than I groaned.
0061689246|2.0|My husband recommended that I try a Niel Gaiman book after he read Coraline so I picked up Stardust because it was familiar (I haven't seen the movie but I've seen the trailer enough). Being an author myself I don't want to bash a fellow author but this book left me disappointed.<br /><br />There are many rules about writing stories and most of them can be thrown out the window in the right circumstances but one seems to be cardinal:  do not let the reader fall out of the \\"fictive dream.\\"<br /><br />Things like bowel movements and male characters pissing on fires break that rule for me. Was that really necessary? It gave nothing to the story and would not have hurt it in any way if it was taken out. It reminded me of movies adding extra sex and violence just to get the extra coolness of being \\"R\\" rated. Pure vanity.<br /><br />Along that same line why would he introduce a character by having her drop an \\"F Bomb\\" when the rest of the book all she says is along the lines of idiot, dunderhead, dolt, etc...<br /><br />I can't say that the story wasn't intriguing, but it was so sloppy that it left me frustrated. I hope his other works do not share the same weaknesses. I hate giving a book less than four stars, I would like to give it a two and a half but having to choose between two and three I could not justify a full three. My apologies to Niel.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Considering the Rollings Stones' classic era, there are two albums that represent their most creative, complex, and sophisticated works: \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and the subject album here, \\"Let it Bleed.\\" A major reason Let it Bleed remains very close to, but does not quite equal Sticky Fingers is the simple fact that Honky Tonk Women was not included in this collection, as it rightfully should have been. Instead, Mick and Keith decided to throw some cheese into the fine wine with \\"Country Honk,\\" a silly little ditty but really belonging more on the countryish \\"Beggars Banquet\\" album. In fact, two songs that should have appeared on Let it Bleed were released instead on their compilation album \\"Through the Past Darkly.\\"<br /><br />Honky Tonk Women is perhaps one of the Rolling Stones' top five classics from the 1960s and should have been included on Let it Bleed in lieu of Country Honk. If it had been, then Let it Bleed could then be considered THE top Stones album. As released, it was the last album to include the multi-talented Brian Jones, who died earlier that year. The other '60s classic that could have been added here as well is Jumpin' Jack Flash. If so, it could have replaced \\"Love in Vain,\\" yet another countryish, kind of slow, but still wonderfully perfomed romantic ballad written by Robert Johnson. Now imagine Let it Bleed with Honky Tonk Women AND Jumpin' Jack Flash! Then you would have had a Jagger-Richards \\"gem stone\\" collection that even Sticky Fingers could not have matched, a very tall order!<br /><br />Nevertheless, Let it Bleed is essential listening for any Stones fan, and easily rates five stars for classic rock, even outside the Stones catalog. The brooding, ominous \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is probably the best opener of any Stones album ever. It starts out quietly enough, almost imperceptably; and then quickly crashes all around you like some montrous tidal wave. This cut is no doubt the very best Rolling Stones composition of all time....everything is perfect on this masterpiece! \\"Monkey Man\\" contains some outstanding keyboard work, the best of which is represented by some beautiful-sounding vibraphones, but the original mastering left these vibes way too far in th ebackground. \\"Live With Me\\" begins with a fantastic bass line by Keef, and later lets loose with a sexy sax solo by Bobby Keys. This is a tune the Stones were born to play, and like the rest of the album, represents Jagger's vocals at their very finest -- raw, bluesy, and totally in command.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler\\" is the Head Stone as villain again -- a dark, eerie, and terrifying persona (compare Jagger's dramatic lyrics and performance here with his lightweight, \\"glitter-boy\\" falsetto voice of the latter '70s and '80s.) Even Keith does a respectable job with \\"You've Got the Silver,\\" probably his best lead vocal of any Stones tune. And who can argue with the majestic greatness of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" with it's wistful opening and soaring, crescendo-like finale?<br /><br />Overall, an outstanding arrangement by the Rolling Stones, a timeless album that can be played throughout the years as a prime example of what made this group once-upon-a-time the \\"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.\\"t on this masterpiece! \\"Monkey Man\\" contains some outstanding keyboard work, the best of which is represented by some beautiful-sounding vibraphones, but the original mastering left these vibes way too far in th ebackground. \\"Live With Me\\" begins with a fantastic bass line by Keef, and later lets loose with a sexy sax solo by Bobby Keys.

B000000W5N|5.0|Of all the Rolling Stones albums, this one stands as their definitive Masterpiece. Period. No other album before or since can match this work, although its immediate studio predecessor, LET IT BLEED, comes in as a very close second. When released in 1971, the LP title and \\"artwork\\" was considered ingenious by some and outrageous by others. It certainly cemented the Stones with the \\"bad boys\\" label they had always looked for.<br /><br />STICKY FINGERS may not garner a perfect five star rating (perhaps 4.9) however, as Mick and Keith chose to include the forgettable non-Stones tune \\"You Gotta Move,\\" which really should have been delayed and moved to their garage-sounding EXILE album in 1972. Instead of this McDowell-Davis \\"blues roots\\" tune, the Stones should have replaced it with a Let It Bleed song. They still could have kept things tongue-in-cheek, if that was their intention, with \\"County Honk.\\" And THAT tune should have originally been displaced on Let it Bleed by its original inspiration, the incomparable Honky Tonk Women. Had those two changes been released on both albums, then Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers would have reached even higher acclaim than they did (if that were even possible). But I digress....<br /><br />The opening tune, \\"Brown Sugar\\" is a rock-radio staple, and it would be hard to find anyone in the Western world who hasn't heard this overplayed classic. With its perfect blend of piano, sax, and acoustic guitars, it's still a rockin' good time....\\"how come ya taste so good?\\" even four decades later!<br /><br />The next number, \\"Sway\\" has been identified by some Stone heads as the best song on the album. A strong argument can be made for this, as Sway hits you with a startling, powerful yet haunting riff not unlike Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir.\\" Sway doesn't fade out, but instead \\"fades up\\" with a dramatic crescendo, complete with intense strings and one of Mick Taylor's best lead guitar solos ever. And Charlie Watts' percussion work is definitely a stand-out on Sway.<br /><br />\\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\" is unusual in the sense that it can be cleanly split into Parts 1 and 2. The first part is simply kick-@ss Rock and Rolling Stones at their very best, music they were BORN to play. In fact, the first two seconds of the opening guitar riff amazingly gives it away: you know something powerful is about to hit you between the buttons. Part 2 takes a dramatic turn into a jazz-funk-soul-rock fusion jam that is reminiscent of something off Santana's ABRAXAS. Bobby Keys and his incomparable sax steals the show here.<br /><br />\\"Wild Horses\\" is simply the best romantic ballad the Stones have ever written. Mick's vocals are heartfelt, aching, and at once emotional to the core. It is a great example of beautiful \\"Soft Stones,\\" in the same vein of As Tears Go By from the '60s, but much more powerful. For those who really love this type of Stones ballad, there is only one other tune that comes very close to Wild Horses, and that is \\"Winter\\" from the `73 Goats Head album.<br /><br />\\"You Gotta Move\\" is what should have happened to that silly farce, as already mentioned, to Exile on Main Street where it belongs. As traditional copy-cats of the Beatles, this tune seems like Mick and the boys were out to match the ridiculous \\"You Know My Name (look up the number),\\" which by the way, featured the Stones' Brian Jones on saxophone.<br /><br />\\"Bitch\\" is Jagger with a mean streak, \\"feeling so tired, can't understand it; just had a fortnight's sleep.\\" A bit reminiscent of \\"Stupid Girl\\" from AFTERMATH, where he sang about how \\"I'm sick and tired and I really have my doubts; I've tried and tried but it never really works out.\\" It's a great tune with lots of sexy saxophone by Keyes.<br /><br />\\"I Got The Blues\\" is an outstanding recording, with Billy Preston's Hammond reverberating throughout like some gospel-influenced, southern spiritual. Jagger even sings \\"Every night you've been away, I've sat down and I have prayed...\\" His vocals here are very intense and emotional, especially with his screaming climax, \\"I'm gonna tear my hair out just for you; If you don't believe what I'm saying...at 3 o'clock in the morning, babe, well, I'm singing my song for you.\\" The incredible thing about this tune is it receives virtually no air play. Yet when people who are just discovering the Stones' classic era hear this song they are blown away by its raw \\"blues power.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sister Morphine\\" is possibly the weakest song on this album (with the exception of \\"You Gotta Move,\\" already dismissed as an EXILE filler).  It's lyrics seem contrived, as if Jagger-Richards feel compelled to chronicle the excesses of mind-bending drugs during the Psychedelic Sixties: \\"...the scream of ambulances... I'm trying to score...this shot will be my last...Cousin Cocaine...in the morning I'll be dead...white sheets stained red\\"....etc. In retrospect, the song's lyrics DID capture the fate of giants who had only recently fallen: Hendrix, Joplin, and of course, the founder of the Rolling Stones himself, Brian Jones. Appropriately, the melody and beat invoke a melancholy, depressing context.<br /><br />\\"Dead Flowers\\" could have been lifted straight from Beggars Banquet, an album loaded with country-flavored tunes. Nevertheless, the song works here, with a catchy beat and infectious chorus, even with Jagger's fake English Dixie-drawl. The main knock against it is yet another reference to hard drugs: \\"I'll be in my basement room, with a needle and a spoon.\\" Other than that, the song has kind of a happy-go-lucky feel to it, but could have complemented the tunes on EXILE quite nicely.<br /><br />The last song, \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is a great closer for Sticky Fingers. Now here is a gorgeous, dreamlike voyage into the heavens. It opens with a sound reminiscent of something from the Orient. Then is slowly drifts into a mysterious and surrealistic fantasy, in large part due to Paul Buckmaster's incredible string arrangements. If any song from the album could be characterized as \\"exquisite,\\" this is it. Along with other classic tunes from this era, Moonlight Mile showcases the Rolling Stones at their absolute creative peak.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Sticky Fingers represents the Mt. Everest of the entire Stones collection; no other album has reached this height before or since.

1582701709|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the book as well as benefitted from it.  The purchasing process was easy.  The book arrived quickly in the condition described.  I would purchase from them again.  Overall, I was extremely happy with the process!
0439023483|4.0|When I first began reading this book I was shocked at the blatant plagiarism of Koushin Takami's \\"Battle Royale.\\" The book has almost an exact replica of the storyline, and as \\"Battle Royale\\" is one of my favorite stories, I was upset. But for some reason I was still unable to put this book down. It was thrilling, suspenseful, and I really found myself liking and cheering on the protagonist, Katniss. Eventually the book begins to distinguish itself as its own story, and this is where I began to really enjoy \\"Hunger Games.\\"    There were still many shocking similarities to \\"Battle Royale\\" and I even felt that it stole the idea of a town with a lottery system for choosing human sacrifices from Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery.\\" I just want to make it clear that this book is in no way original, and at times the reader may feel as if they have heard the story before. Despite this I still recommend this book. It does have its strong points. For one it is more of a young adult version of Battle Royale which expands the book's potential audience. Battle Royale has some extremely adult content and themes and although I love the story, I was unable to share it with my 14 year old sister. Although as soon as I finished Hunger Games I lent it to her. It also does have enough distinguishing features to make it its own story, and a good one at that. At the end of book one I found myself wanting more. I definitely plan on buying Part 2, and would tell anyone looking for a fast paced, suspenseful book, to definitely give Hunger Games a read.
B001R3ZA4U|1.0|Been watching for every season and finally felt like they are off in la la land with that plot and about 1/3 of the dialog. It's like everybody is on drugs or something. The acting was frankly horible from everyone from Clark to Tess. It felt like some kids from highschool ran a video production project with about as much depth. So bumbed.
1400082773|5.0|I read this book with great interest. First, from a curiousity standpoint; how does he see Kenya and does he understand it's complexity. Another perspective that i looked into was his obsession to find himself in his father. I'm Kenyan and know what a father means to one if absent. My dad died when i was eleven and i explored him alot-still do. My mother kept him fresh in our minds and i've concluded that the absent parent becomes the focal point of a young boy. Men,as many may disagree, will seek their father to relate to and will yearn and seek that figure,if they don't find him appealing when they find him, they become what they hope he was. I was enthralled that he is able to explain Kenyan issues i'm familiar with and places i've trod with such precision. Very titillating.
1579125549|5.0|This is a great learning tool to anyone from a rookie to a master.  The book teaches you how to read the whole board instead of just looking at making a move you may regret.  I was having trouble with my end game where I was only able to mate with back rank mates.  The book has taught me to use all pieces to mate.  I was told this would be a great book to learn different aspects of the game by the 2003 Louisiana State Champion (Alvin Dominique) and he was ever so right!!! A+ tool!!!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This 5 disc set is amazing. The behind the scenes feature \\"Dangerous Days\\" is my favorite part of the set. Just wish it was in HD.
B0013USZHG|4.0|It is a nice CD. It is a collection of exuberant music that is not often heard. I enjoyed it and have played it a few times since I purchased it. The musicianship is fundamentally sincere but lacks a bit professional polish. On the positive side it has freshness and youthful enthusiasm that is delightful. I would recommend it. I have given it a four star rating strictly in light of my earlier comments.
B000063Y8F|5.0|This product is great - easy to clean and sturdy. Showed up much more swiftly than originally promised.  Very satisfied.
B001JEDR6U|5.0|This, and a couple of previous editions that I own, are the most powerful writing references I've ever used. I keep one at work, one at home, and bought copies for my wife and son.<br /><br />I first read the little book almost 30 years ago while in school. I continue to use it regularly to settle those nagging little usage issues that plague me from time to time. Has the knowledge made me a better writer? Yes, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.<br /><br />If you could only have one writing reference on your shelf, this would be the one.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll ever be able to adopt Prof. Strunk's word, \\"forcible\\", but I'll continue to think about it. Happy writing!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I imagine most purchasers of this dvd collection have already seen this version, and love it.  The 120-page companion book is fun to read, and has lots of details and pictures.    My only complaint is the way the dvds themselves are held into their book.  The discs are each slipped halfway down their thin paperboard sleeves, and attached by a foam-type center knob to the insides of the dvd folder.  It is difficult to pry the discs off the rubber knob and at the same time be careful not to rip the sides of the thin paperboard sleeves.  The discs really are a pain to get out.  They are easy enough to get back in, but then you are unlikely to rip the sides putting them in like you are in the removal.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog is a great piece of art that truly invokes all emotions.  The music made me go out and buy the CD.  I bought the DVD as gifts for all of my friends and family who are also Joss Whedon fans.  They love it too!!  I highly recommend it to all!!

6305907145|2.0|Ugh, this movie does not deserve the same title as the Jane Austen novel. Well, yes, the characters have the same names, but that's about it. I don't know where on earth this screenplay came from, but it's not Mansfield Park. If you enjoyed Austen's book, don't waste your time on this movie.

B001BR5F4C|5.0|The movies I currently have on Blu-ray are Iron Man, Kill Bill, The Dark Knight, and Wall-E, and Kill Bill is the second best in video quality on the list, second only to Wall-E.<br /><br />Kill Bill was my first Blu-ray purchase (which is funny because the first DVD I bought was my favorite movie at the time, The Matrix, and Kill Bill is my new favorite movie), and I am really impressed with it. Aside from the lack of special features, it's just incredible. The video transfer is a lot better than what the DVDs were at an output of 1080p and the audio is crystal clear at uncompressed, lossless PCM 5.1. I doubled over with shock when I saw the opening scene of the Vernita Green chapter because of how wonderfully vibrant the colors are. It really made me feel like I was back in the theater again, even though my TV is only 40\\". If you love Kill Bill, then this is pretty much a must-own. While I don't think you should dump all your DVDs for Blu-ray discs, you should know that there's an appreciable difference in quality if you have the TV for it and the visual qualities of the movie are Blu-ray worthy (like Kill Bill). I know that not many people think there's a difference, but you'd be amazed how quickly you turn into a videophile when you see a movie like this in Blu-ray.<br /><br />As for the movie itself: the only Tarantino movie better than Kill Bill is Pulp Fiction, but I prefer Kill Bill because it has such an awesome mix of heartfelt moments, great music, over-the-top action scenes, and memorable dialogue. You have to go into Vol. 1 expecting lots of blood and unnecessary violence and appreciate that it's a homage. Vol. 1 is just a lot of fun and the cinematography is always spot-on. Then Vol. 2 comes around and brings you more of the story you may have thought was missing along with a lot of smart lines and even more interesting characters than the first. The two together are a symphony of what I love about cinema. I know that few people share my love of this movie, but I think that it's a movie worth seeing at least once, if not several times.ink that it's a movie worth seeing at least once, if not several times.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|just by searching for highly rated blu-ray films, I came across this BBC series.  I didn't get disappointed.  it is shown in a dramatically and thrilling way, how our earth looks like.  my kids love to watch it over and over again.    and this is my reference movie for my HD-TV, if I get guests and want to have something on the TV.    definately a MUST HAVE blu-ray for a reasonable price on amazon.
B000P7V45S|4.0|Obviously if there is enough mentioning of unimpressive remastering, they had to have gotten something wrong. Yes, there are some really well done passages that bring to light spectacular new dimension previously buried in the mix, but that is more the exception then the rule. There is just a certain detachment that prevents truly melding to the mostly awe-inspiring material, leaving a final product shiny in certain spots, though coldly balanced in muted tones. Having said that, if I were to hear it for the first time without any preconceived notions I would still be blown away, if slightly less then what the album is fully capable of achieving.
031606792X|4.0|I loved the first 3 books, who wouldn't?  But after reading a few reviews on this site about Breaking Dawn I was skeptical going into it.  I loved the first few chapters of the 4th book but after reading last chapter of Bella's first narration I was flabbergasted.  How could Stephenie do this to us, her faithful readers?  But I was committed to the book so I kept reading.  I didn't really like Jacob's part in this and how Bella couldn't let him go.  Once I finished the book, though, I saw the reason behind the craziness and I just about agreed with it.  I know that some people have problems with how the book ended so neatly w/o hardly any bloodshed but to me I liked it, I like it when my beloved characters can get out all right and get on with their beautiful lives.  So in the end and afer rereading it a few times I have discovered that I do like it although Twilight will be my favorite of the four.

1932100660|5.0|This book will change how you see meat and dairy products.  I thought I would have a difficult time becoming a vegetarian because I used to love to eat porterhouse steak and BBQ chicken during the summer.  Well, I'm just a little more than 1/3 through reading this book and can't put it down.  I don't want meat and can't believe I've eaten it so long.  My goodness.  Ignorance is such bliss.    I would recommend this book to ALL parents, people with a history or family history of breast cancer, people with a history or family history of heart disease, diabetes, ....etc.  All of the diseases you get appear to be so connected with the way we eat.  It almost makes me feel like a bad parent now knowing I've fed my kids so much poultry, beef and seafood.    I can't wait to get home from work and begin reading some more of this book.    I plan to read it again after I'm done and I've bought the audio version for my husband to listen to since he's not into reading.  I plan on listening to that too over and over again.    People...wake up.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This TV series was very well made. Very authentic shoot and 90% true to the historical concept of the story. I made some online checking after watching the movie and the stories seems to be true. I do wish that the series was longer and the characters were more reviewed in depth. Overall, i think that this is a must have for all WWII collectors (especially in blue ray).
B000MRA6AK|4.0|... moreover, there's a better alternative on LP with cleaner sound (I'll get to that in a moment), and that's why I can't give this remastered CD five stars.  The performances, on the other hand, are timeless, incomparable, and classic -- if you're ANY kind of jazz fan, this belongs in your permanent music library.    At The Pershing (recorded here in Chicago) has been so influential on so many jazz artists, but more than that, it is just SO easy to listen to, bright, inventive, engaging, hypnotic.  It draws you in and holds you right on through the last cut.  Long one of my most valued jazz recordings, it includes what is probably the definitive version of \\"Poinciana,\\" which Jamal made forever his own with this performance.    But like I said, there's a better alternative on VINYL, if you can find it:  Sun Set: Live At The Pershing Vol 1 & 2 / At The Blackhawk, a 2-LP set by Chess of the original Argo 1958 and 1961 recordings.  Unlike the folks who put out this \\"Complete Live At The Pershing Lounge\\" CD, Chess got a good master somewhere -- and the sound quality of the LP set does justice to the performances, which are just completely enchanting.  I used to own this LP set and played it to death for years, over and over until I lost it in a building fire (luckily, I'd made a cassette tape copy that survived, which I played until *that* wore out and self-destructed).  I can still remember most of Poinciana bar by bar in my head and never tire of it.    [...]    I cannot imagine that anyone in his right mind who has a copy of the 2-LP Sun Set would ever part with it -- but if you DO see a copy on vinyl in reasonably good shape, snatch it up quickly!!!  You'll be glad you did: this is the best that Ahmad Jamal has *ever* played, and I love it still.  So will you.    Barring that, I guess you'll just have to settle for this second-best CD -- but it's still VERRRRRY much worth having.  Even badly remastered Ahmad Jamal is still a joy!
B000002UAX|5.0|Let's see, what can I say that hasn't been said already!? I'm really not sure, so I'll just speak for myself. I grew up a child of the 80's, and in that time I (like many youngsters my age) grew up on either hard core metal, or pop songs. I myself, loved the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM).     Now, buying the metal magazines, I would always read how the BEATLES inspired just about every band out there (from the heaviest of metal, and so on...), and in particular \\"The White Album\\", due to it's melody and song structure. Seeing this, I decided to purchase the disc (s')(actually, I recieved them as a gift from my sister Christine) and see for myself. The lyrics tell stories that take you into a world unto it's own, with each guitar track played to perfection. I hear these melodies in almost every band out there.     BOTTOM LINE - If you're a new Beatles fan, buy the White Album first, then consider the RED and BLUE Greatest Hits Discs which cover their entire career. You'll be hooked, I promise you. Special thanks to my sister Christine, for turning me into a fan.    I would give it six stars if I could...
B00005O3VC|5.0|How can you pass up a movie with a killer rabbit, a black knight with delusions of immortality, Tim the enchanter, a holy hand grenade...

B000UJCALI|5.0|This extreme thriller is a remake of Stephen King's book. Jack Nicholson at his best. One of my favorite movies. Absolutely amazing. 10 out of 10.
6305014140|5.0|As a non-anime kinda guy, I never would have expected a movie like this to be so darn good. It's got an entirely different feel than other products of its genre - specifically, a great plot that doesn't require a strong Dungeons and Dragons background to understand.    It's got some really strong thematic elements, such as:  - A reluctant hero  - A femme fetal  - Seemingly impossible odds  - A great finale    Ninja Scroll's strength comes from a solid plot, great character dialog, strong character arcs (both leads) and clever directing. Unlike other movies of this genre, this film does not rely entirely on spectacular animation; in fact, there's a good chance you'll forget your even watching an animation at all.    Still not convinced? Consider how popular ninjas have become. Buying another movie with the word \\"Ninja\\" in the title could make you more popular. Just a thought.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|well i did just write something like a 300 word review and it was deleted. so here's my new one. Requiem= an absolutely amazing movie. It's the best drug movie out there. If you liked either Trainspotting or Pi, watch this. If you liked Requiem, you should like either of those. By watching this movie you'll learn more about yourself and hopefully feel better about your life. Make sure though that you are at least of age because the themes in this movie are very provocative and possibly offending. So just watch it.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I think this is a great circuit training type of workout video.  It consists of 3 workouts, <25 minutes long each.  Each workout is a series of strength (3 minutes), cardio (2 minutes), and an abs workout (1 minute), repeated 3 times in the workout, with a warm-up and cool down period.  I find each level challenging but they definitely get progressively more difficult as you advance to the next level.  I often combine levels to get in a longer workout.  Great workout overall only the music gets a bit annoying the more often you do the video.  Jillian does a great job at encouraging you to continue with the exercises even when you feel like you're ready to die.
B001GAOY5U|3.0|The blu-ray version appears to have very average 3d affects. I did not see this in the movie theatre, so I have no comparison to the 3d theatre release.    I would not recommend this if you are buying it for the 3d.  For the story itself, it's not bad. Good performance by all the actors  definitely a good kids movie. Music score is quite good.    Feature set on the blu-ray is limited compared to some other blu-rays I have seen. I rented this through netflix
B0013FYTA8|1.0|good god, ive heardd 3 of their songs on the radio and sampled the rest just to make sure i wasnt wrong (and i wasnt)    bands like this are why i cant listen to the radio any more, its bad enough that most rock stations have been playing the same rock hits for the past 25 yrs, but TOAD has to be the most bland, watered down, talentless load of crap ive heard in a long time     boring radio-rock bands have been slowly but surly killing rock for as long as i can remember, and TOAD seems determined to bring about a swift, if not merciful death to the genre (i do like rock mind you)    R.I.P Rock
B001F7MSFM|4.0|The real problem with Hellboy 2 isn't what you'd think, because it avoids the standard superhero movie pitfalls brilliantly.  In fact, it avoids said pitfalls in exactly the same way as the first movie did, by copying several scenes from it.    Hellboy having relationship troubles?  Check.  Fight with huge, tentacled monster that comes up through the ground?  Check.  Prickly boss that turns out to be cooler than we thought in the end?  Check.  Characters giving their all for love, and calling back loved ones from the brink of death?  It's in there.    Though there's also plenty of original material here, it's sadly underdeveloped.  The new villain and his rather unconventional relationship with his sister got short shrift.  Also, when the public turns against Hellboy and his teammates, their reaction is given very little attention.     However, the movie is hardly a total loss.  Hellboy is as cool and funny as ever, and in this go-round we get more of Abe Sapien's lovably dorky personality for him to bounce off of.  The battle scenes are awesome, exciting and original with interesting effects and concepts that mixed fairy tales with more modern sci-fi.  And even though a lot of scenes weren't exactly unique, they were still well done and well executed.    Overall, this movie is more than worth buying.  The main characters are some of the most fun and memorable in modern movies--not just superhero movies--and the action scenes aren't like anything you've seen before.  Enjoy it, and let's all hope that for the third movie, Del Toro comes up with some different ideas.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|First of all, when you are writing a follow up to an album like St. Anger, chances are it can't possibly get any worse. St. Anger was, without a doubt, one of the worst albums ever. So the fact this is better doesn't say much.    As for the actual music, this IS NOT THRASH. They haven't written a thrash album in nearly 21 years. Anyone who says that clearly needs to reacquaint themselves with what thrash is and what it sounds like. This is heavy metal at best, and borders upon plain rock at some points. Regardless, it sounds forced, like they are trying far harder than they should need to.     As usual the drumming is (mostly) passable and competent, but is pretty poor and uninspired (which is no chance for Lars, as he's never been particularly good.    The lyrics as well range from pretty horrible to fairly decent. Lines like \\"Love is a four letter word\\" and  \\"almost like your endless fight/cursed, the day is long/realize you don't belong\\" are nothing short of pathetic. Really Metallica? When did oyu hire Fall Out Boy to pen your lyrics? Are you going to go slit your wrist now too?    I was both excited and intrigued to hear that they would return to writing an instrumental. Sadly, it is a bloated and frankly, boring filler track, certainly nothing up to par with the ones they used to be able to write.    The best part of this album is by far the soloing of the great Kirk Hammett. And, although the solos he produces are quite good, some of them carry on far too long for their own good and become simply boring near the end.    Ultimately though, whether or no you like this depends, as other reviewers have mentioned, on what your 'fan' status is with Metallica. If you are the true-blue thrash fan and think 'Ride the Lightning\\" was their last truly great album, you'll hate this. If you are like me and think \\"...And Justice For all\\" and \\"Metallica\\" were 'ok' you might be able to listen to this and find it mediocre at best. It is heavier than either \\"Load\\" or \\"Reload,\\"making this an iffy listen for fans of those two. And if you were a fan of \\"St. Anger\\" you have no concept of what good music is so it doesn't actually matter to anyone what you think of this album.    Metallica should realize that their glory days are long, long gone and that they need to take the hint and retire rather than force and album like they did with \\"Death Magnetic.\\"    This earns 2 stars simply because \\"St. Anger\\" was much worse and some moments are decent, especially the Hammett solos.

B001MW0IY8|5.0|THE CRYING LIGHT is my first album by Antony and the Johnsons. I had never heard of Antony Hegarty until this year in an issue of Rolling Stone magazine and a slew of music/entertainment related magazines. Well curiosity killed this cat. After hearing samples of THE CRYING LIGHT and liked what I heard, I bought a copy. What first drew me to the music was Antony's distinct vocals which is somewhere between Marlene Dietrich and Boy George. I love how his vocals can go deep to high pitched within a few notes in one song. I really can't find the right words to describe Antony and the Johnson's music other than it is jazz-infused pop. The overall mood of the album is subdued but never boring. \\"Another World\\" is one of my personal favorite songs on the album with its haunting lyrics and melodies. \\"Daylight and the Sun\\" is another favorite. For me whenever I listen to this particular track, I envision the song as a soundtrack to an old silent film. I have been listening to THE CRYING LIGHT all day long and I have yet to find one song that I did not like. Rarely do I buy into the hype by mainstream music magazines like RS but they were right on target with Antony and the Johnsons.
045122499X|2.0|This book has been a huge disappointment. I remember \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" with a great deal enjoyment but this book is just too filled with \\"You gotta be kidding.\\", \\"Ah Geez.\\", \\"Give me a break.\\" moments. In trying to be politically correct Follett rewrites womens' history and consistently injects Muslim adoration.     This the last Follett book I buy.

B000ASATZ8|3.0|I really liked this movie. it was funny and kind of dorky but it was alot of fun to watch. All the ingredients for a good old fashioned sci fi movie. It has action as Kevin B. and Fred W. make a good cominic duo and add Fred G. and Reba M. as the survivalists. If u don't own u should and if by some odd chance u have missed it on sunday afternoons u should watch it.

B000J0NIIW|4.0|I did a lot of research on different sweepers before I made a decision on purchasing one.  I just had tile floors put in my entire house except for the bedrooms a few months ago.  I wanted something to make sweeping the tile floors much easier than my old broom and dust pan.  While researching sweepers, I was informed of the possible battery issue.  I have taken the precautionary actions recommended--remove the battery from the sweeper when it is not in use, completely drain the battery before charging it again & don't leave it on the charger for too long (I usually put it on the charger overnight & then take it off in the morning).  The sweeper does a really good job of picking things up.  I use it every 1-2 days and so far have not had any issues.  I am very happy with it.

1892005034|3.0|I think there are some valuable insights and tools in Nonviolent Communication, and I'm very heartened to see a yearning growing among people, the desire to be able to talk to and listen to each other more fully, freely and openly. At the same time, for someone who wants to learn to talk to others (and themselves, as well!) in a more open and less defensive way, in a way that makes it easier for people to speak openly to each other, I find Sharon Ellison's book, Taking the War Out of Our Words: Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a much clearer, more complete and more effective paradigm and method for a non-defensive model of communication than Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication.  [[ASIN:0982051824 Taking The War Out Of Our Words (2009 Edition)]]<br /><br />I have found value in Rosenberg's lists of feelings and, in peripheral ways, in some of his exercises, among other things. However, while one of the stated aims of the process is to eliminate judgement and criticism, I respond to some of his dialogue as if there is judgement hidden within it. I also find his methods rather cumbersome.<br /><br />Taking the War Out of Our Words gives me a substantially different, much more positive experience. In the presence of Ellison's writing - explanation, description, exercises, examples, and so on - I find myself relaxing, and feeling safe even while I confront and acknowledge the ways in which I myself act defensively. Her book is very rich in detailed examples, and alive with individual voices. (It also has a wonderful index to the examples, so you can follow them from one part of the book to another.) I find encouragement and acceptance, as well as simple, clear steps I can immediately begin to apply to the way I say things. It has been my experience that these small changes often make a rapid difference.<br /><br />Ellison's process speaks more strongly to me than Rosenberg's, and I find it more gentle as well as clearer. I believe that her framework is simultaneously both more radical and simpler than Marshall Rosenberg's. To me, Rosenberg's system nibbles at the edges of our difficulties in communicating with each other, where Sharon Ellison's sweeps the rubble out of the center and starts rebuilding the structures of our communication, but in a way that makes an intuitive kind of sense.<br /><br />Ellison examines and identifies the fundamental structures of our languages (not only English, but many other languages as well) which, it seems, almost inevitably cause defensiveness between us, even when we don't mean them to. I find her tools profoundly practical and useful, and I find it easy to begin applying them; and even though the process of becoming significantly less defensive is a long one, and not very easy, the encouraging experience of little successes, here and there, helps keep me going. It also seems to me that achieving the very smallest changes, working with everyday issues, is in the end what creates the deepest shift.<br /><br />Despite my own preference for Sharon Ellison's paradigm and tools, I would not want to discourage anyone from trying Rosenberg's program. At the same time, I would encourage anyone who experiences any difficulty in applying his system not to give up on the hope of learning a more peaceable and open way of communication, but to have a look at Ellison's book and see if you find it more helpful.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I had never heard of the movie, so it was wonderful to turn it on and discover what a gem of a film it is.

B000286RNY|5.0|I know that Stephen Chow has a large body of work but being an American this was the first film I got to see.  I couldn't have been blown away more. I liken it to movies like Groundhog Day or even Office Space, you didn't think they would be as good as they were.  This movie is really fun and it sucks you in.  Personally I like this better than Kung Fu Hustle the concept itself is more interesting and the outrageous characters seem more down to earth.

I laugh till I cry, every time I read it (and I must have read it a dozen times by now).       If you've never read anything by Gerald Durrell, and if you enjoy stories of young boys growing up in an extraordinary environment, with a delightful cast of his family and other memorable characters,  READ THIS!
159448385X|5.0|When I read the Kite Runner I thought Khaled Hosseini could only go downwards from here but I was dead wrong. This book describes the characters and the sequence of their lives in perfect form. It does not read and spell everything and allows for you you think and draw inferences, so you're never bored. It made me feel like I was a part of the book, like I knew them all personally. Hosseini is a brilliant writer, I can't wait for his next book to come out. I strongly suggest you only read when you have time to spare cause you'll have great difficulty putting this book down.
0876304420|5.0|Steve Gilligan is a remarkable healer (although he probably wouldn't choose that label himself) and teacher and Therapeutic Trances lays out the principles and practice of creating rapport, accepting and utilizing the patient's worldview and symptoms, and joining with the patient in order to create a hypnotic environment in which true healing can take place.<br /><br />The one thing that strikes me as slightly challenging about Therapeutic Trances is the academic tone of the book. That said, this is an indispensable manual for understanding Ericksonian hypnosis from someone who started studying with Erickson at age 19.<br /><br />Therapeutic Trances is not an easy read, but what you learn in the pages will probably change not only your practice but the way you see the world. A great book by a master practitioner and compassionate teacher.

I have to admit that I never really felt compassion for John.  I thought he was too driven and far too apathetic toward the needs of his sons.  After reading this I have to admit, my animosity toward him has softened a bit.  This is a must have for any fan of Supernatural.  It is a quick and informative read that makes you look and the show and its characters with a different eye.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Dire Straits, and have recently started listening to Mark Knopfler's albums. The Golden Heart album is as good if not better than any of Dire Straits' releases, although the music is of course somewhat more mellow than the rock bank. Shangri-La is the second of MK's albums that I've purchased and it ranks close to Golden Heart in pure listening pleasure. Needless to say, I'm sold on Knopfler. With 14 songs and over 60 minutes of great music you get a lot for your money. Postcards From Paraguay, 5:15 A.M., and The Trawlerman's Song are my favorites, but all 14 of the songs are good.  As a songwriter, I think Knopfler is as good as Lennon/McCartney, Elton John, or Paul Simon, but like Dire Straits, he's underrated and unappreciated.
1907590331|5.0|George and Lennie are drifters, moving from rural property to rural property, they go wherever work takes them. They stay for as long as their luck lasts, doing whatever the current job demands, but come what may George and Lennie stick together. George is small, fast to loose his temper and smart. Lennie is big, always affable and dim-witted. Lennie needs George to look after him, and George sometimes wishes that he was able to live life free and easy, free to gamble and booze his money away. Lennie's slow wit often gets him into trouble in the rough and tumble, male world of the rural society. Now \\"a few miles south of Soledad\\" George and Lennie are about to start a new job. Before they enter the property the two camp out overnight so George can enjoy the scenery. This proves to be the calm before the storm as the two are about to experience life-changing events.<br /><br />This is a short book, being just under 100 pages, but it contains much to be thought about. Steinbeck describes in detail the harsh way men choose to live. He notes how, in this environment, some men rise to become leaders, being hero-worshiped in such a way that their word becomes almost gospel in the minds of other men. But Stienbeck, through the friendship of George and Lennie, also notes that there is another, more caring way for men to live. Of course even those who follow a philosophy of caring live in the real world of struggle in which circumstances are not easy to resolve, and Steinbeck is well aware of this. Steinbeck's beliefs are informed by his knowledge of Christianity, but one does not have to slavishly follow that religion to agree with what he is saying. This book was first published in 1937, but is contains ideas that have finally flourished in the New Age Men's movement of the late Twentieth Century.<br /><br />This book is stylistically interesting. Steinbeck deliberately wrote his prose in a way which imitates plays (drama). Events take place in a set 'scene' and characters enter, interact and leave. Dialogue, rather than action, is emphasized. The author, indeed, later wrote a theater version of this story. He did the same thing with the book _The Moon is Down_. Through Steinbecks skillfully woven dialogue we gain a good understanding of his main characters and Lennie is one of his most poignant creations. The climaxes of this tale, and there are more than one, are also memorable.<br /><br />John Steinbeck is of course a famous author and this is one of his most well known novels. I am glad to say I did not find it in the least disappointing and I am very happy to award it five stars.enter, interact and leave. Dialogue, rather than action, is emphasized.

0380713802|1.0|i found this book to be such a downer.  almost every new location he visits there's always something wrong.  it might be the locals are mean, some parts of the cities are dreary and could be so much more beautiful, the trains run too slow, god forbid a local that can't help him because he doesn't speak english, or things are just too expensive.   waaaah, waaaaah, waaaaaah.  you know what?  how about trying to find the positive things when you travel and write about those?  use the negative things that happen as anecdotes but not the focus.  i've been to many of those places he wrote about and have really great memories and i don't focus on the negative.  so what, florence can be hot and crowded in the summer, but is that what i want to remember?  no!  i want to remember seeing the duomo for the first time or walking the boboli gardens.  why do i want to read about someone bitching and complaining about how traveling can sometimes be work and things don't always go the way we want.  that's part of traveling.  he should feel lucky to even have the privilege to travel and probably be paid for it at the same time!  the book is in the recycle bin.

0452289963|3.0|This is a good book for those who want a western perspective on age old ideas into inquiry of the self and mans search for the divine.    The Source of these ideas is from the Well spring of Hindu Thought (Santana Dharma) explored in depth by many other teachers such as Ramana Maharishi and Paramahansa Yogananda.    It brings out the fanatics who see the wellspring of the divine in only one form, theirs - so when reading the reviews, take religious bigotry and narrow minded agenda's into account. If you happen to be one of those folks, don't bother... walk the walk and not the talk.

B001AU8ZLK|5.0|My daughter is a fan of Coldplay, but I've never paid too much attention to her music until I accidentally heard this in our home Theater/Stereo system.     I was surprised that this CD had such an impact on me, ( being primarily a classic rock fan )but after listening to it a few times I've found that Coldplay reflects emotion and thoughtfulness that I honestly thought was lost on most if not all of the more recent groups making money in the music industry these days.     I now own my own copy of this CD, and a few other recordings by Coldplay. Finding that most of their music fit in very well in my Classic Rock collection, and if given half a chance would recommend it with praise to any of my friends.
B000YPUFA6|5.0|The 3rd installment in one of the movies that brought back the Dead films.  This is true if you go back  many  years ago to the George Romero days no one has made a Zombie film for many years.  Then The Resident evil Trilogy started it back again.  In this 3rd installment Alice seems all grown up and ready to kick some Zombie butt.  The Resident Evil movies have all broken many zombie rules.  Alot of older zombie movies were always in the dark or so but now Resident Evil Extinction changes zombie rules again by fighting zombie's in the day light and in the dessert of all place's and in which the earth is covered in.  Awesome times and Milla at her best.  A 4th Resident Evil is in the mind of Paul W. Anderson director of all Resident Evil movies and Husband of Milla Jovovich who also wants to finish the series in a big bang but not sure if Sony wants that also, So will see.   I myself cant get enough of it and would love another installment.  Seeing it in Blu Ray just shows great detail and the time it took to make these zombie's look the best on the big screen in years that I have ever seen. JRod
B000059HAI|5.0|This is perhaps the best war movie ever made, about one of modern history's most important events.  Being historically accurate, it is an excellent way to learn about the beginnings of WWII from the perspective of either Japan or the U.S., without any bias. It has important relevance to the world situation toady because it was a war over resources, mainly oil and rubber, which Japan vitally needed for their booming industry. (Japan became a great industrial power while the rest of the world was mired in the Great Depression). The film gives good coverage to the U.S. embargo against Japan, [which was in response to Japanese aggression in Malaya, China, the Dutch East Indies and French Indo-China] and to the Japanese diplomatic efforts in trying to avoid the [increasingly restrictive list of items added to the] embargo.      Despite providing many political and strategic details, this movie is filled with action and suspense.  The special effects are excellent and add to the realism without being surreal.    The Japanese actors were filmed in Japan, speaking Japanese with English subtitles. The Japanese actors' performance was excellent and the film was very popular in Japan.    This film is a gem and should be required viewing for high school history students, who can learn much about history in a thoroughly entertaining way.  History buffs, scholars and movie fans in general should enjoy seeing this.     My thanks to everyone involved with the production for preserving and portraying this piece of history in such a commendable manner.
B000UR9QGW|5.0|What can I say.  Bruce Campbell makes this series of films come alive.  Owning all 3.  Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, and a bunch of Bruce Campbell collectable's that people admire in my Theater Room.  Ive own the VHS copy then the DVD copy and Now the Blu Ray copy and the picture is awesome.  This scary and slap stick comedy will make a feel funny and scared at the same time. Bruce's talks about a possible Evil Dead 4 but a script still isnt in the cards, but if Sam Raimi has anything to say is that if this happens the cabin must be destroyed.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Yes, that's right.  This may very well be his best solo album.  Never has McCartney been more free, loose, and creative and developed an album worth of songs in which all of them are incredible and sound nothing like each other.  His vocals?  Just listen to the opening track.  I challenge you to find another 66 year-old alive today who can sing like that.  It is arguably his hardest rocking song since Monkberry Moon Delight off of his 1971 album Ram.  The music?  There are great rockers as well as awesome, more subdued tracks.  McCartney plays all the instruments on the album, including lead guitar and drums, and plays them so well that you almost have to wonder why there was a need for George and Ringo in the Beatles other than to have musicians with whom to perform live.  Highlights off of this album include \\"Nothing too much...,\\" \\"Two Magpies,\\" \\"Sing the Changes,\\" \\"Highway\\"...you know what?  I can't list the highlights because the entire album is one big highlight.  Yes this album is that good!  It should be the 2008 album of the year!  Get it ASAP!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an excellent video for those who don't have much time to work out.  It really does replace hours of half hearted gym work.  I love the fact that it's only 20 mins, but an intense 20 mins which is over before you know it.  The levels are no walk in the park!  I rotate the workouts during the week and still do not find level 1 super easy after a month of using the dvd.
B00151HZME|5.0|I wasn't even trying to get into new music this year, but this jumped out at me from a Pitchfork review.  After playing it all the way through twice, my girlfriend and I were hooked; our friends have beent the same way.  If you like a little mellow, 80's style pop, you can't go wrong with M83.  Amazing live show as well.  Left Thanksgiving dinner early to see 'em and weren't disappointed.

015206396X|5.0|Katsa is Graced, meaning that she is especially, exceptionally talented. Her Grace isn't an everyday thing, like really knowing how to wash dishes better than anyone else or even being able to produce exquisite art; Katsa is Graced at fighting and can kill people even when outnumbered by dozens of armed men. She serves her king by enforcing his edicts--and collecting his debts. Everything starts to get complicated when she realizes that she doesn't want to be someone's killing machine, and that by losing herself to the king's will, she's truly losing herself. And that's not even the epic adventure part! This is a strong fantasy story for teen and adult readers with a little romance and a lot of action.
B000669GAI|5.0|The Greatest Hits double cd by Pearl Jam titled Rear View Mirror is just incredible. I am enjoying it immensely. I turn 58 yrs old next Friday and have always had an ear for talent, and these guys got me through the 90's. Thanks, Pearl Jam! Wish i had the lyric sheet though. bill
0525951113|5.0|As the first book in a series, this book is top notch. The writing and plot are excellent, the characters are interesting and the plot is grandiose but still surprisingly believable. This book's probably not for everyone though, the same technical details which make the plot so engrossing would probably just stagger or bore less tech-savvy readers. This book isn't a cliffhanger but the ending lacks finality, this is understandable as the first of several in a series, but with the sequels still at least a year off, those who like this book will be left wishing for more.    Bottom line, if you like techno-thrillers, this is one is excellent, but if you don't know what a tcp/ip stack is, allot of what makes this book so good will probably escape you.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is hands down the funniest show to hit TV in ages - and while funniest for geeks, non-geeks can appreciate the human interactions and humorous social situations. The series starts out funny and just gets funnier as it continues.
B000EULJLU|5.0|...after the release.  I saw them play this in concert 8 times, including once at City Center in Manhattan, May '06 (first tour - they really only played 3 songs from 10K days#, and once in Jesolo, Italy #I happened to be on vacation in Venice!).    Anyway - I have been a Tool fan since about 1996, and have listened hard core since then.  This album is hands down their best work.  It is a masterpiece.
0930289234|5.0|This book is one of the greatest NOVELS ever written.  5 stars doesn't give it justice, it is worth the money, worth the time, and worth the read.

B00005LELD|4.0|This is a must have for the 50mm 1.4 lens.  I leave it on all the time and it pretty much stays out of the way when I don't need it.  It's so nice to be able to just pop it open as I need it.  The only big problem I have is that when it's folded closed you can't really use the manual focus ring because it's mostly covered by the hood.  It's not the biggest deal in the world, but it would be nice to be able to just leave it folded sometimes.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural is one of my all-time favorite shows! I cannot recommend it enough. You just have to see it. I managed to get this season at $14.99, but the disks were scratched. Amazon was great about replacing it right away. Unfortunately, the second set was scratched as well, and Amazon could not replace that one. However, they refunded me promptly and gave me credit for the inconvenience. I ended up getting the third season as a gift for Christmas. I really appreciated the way Amazon tried to make things right for me, though, and would not hesitate to shop here again.

0920668364|4.0|Love You Forever is a bedtime story that any child will enjoy.  It follows a very loving and caring mother who sneaks into her sons room first as a infant, as a toddler, nine years old, as a teenager, and although he no longer lives in the same house as a grown man.  When she comes into the room at night she rocks him back and forth and sings; \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.  She does this until she becomes an old woman, and her son returns the message to her, as well as his very own newborn daughter.  Every picture shows the story line, and a child will soon catch the obvious animal that lurks on each page.  This story is bound to bring togetherness for the family at bedtime.
0765348276|5.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" by John Scalzi<br /><br />The distant future; John Perry did 2 things on his 75th birthday. He visited his wife's grave and signed up for the army. The Colonial Defense Forces are the Earths new cutting edge military. They have all the latest military bells and whistles but they don't share any of them with Earth. The CDF keeps a tight grip on all of it's technoligical advances as well as all interstellar colozination. In fact they control all space travel, both coming and going. What the Colonial Defense Forces does is a bit of a mystery but the word is that they are constantly at war with Alien races across the galaxy for the ever coveted inhabitable planet. The CDF has found a new group to try and recruit which includes seniors age 75+. No one is sure how or why but apparently the CDF has figured out a way to return youth and vitality to a human and that alone is worth the price of admission for many to sign up and leave Earth behind forever. With all of his worldly possessions accounted for John Perry signs up for the ride of his life...<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\" is the second book I have read of John Scalzi's with \\"[[ASIN:0765348284 The Android's Dream]]\\" being the first and both were enjoyable from cover to cover. Scalzi has something of an easy going writing style with that manages to insert just the right amount of description, actions and humor to keep you turning pages. Both books were truly enjoyable.<br /><br />The Good: I always enjoy Scalzi's prose. Scalzi creates interesting characters and an interesting world full of unique takes on technological progress. His writing gives his characters a very real feel to them which makes them enjoyable to read. The overall plot of the story worked well and combined with all other elements made for a great read.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: Although this is Scalzi's first published work he delivers like an old pro. Give \\"Old Mans War\\" a try!

B001LMRCP2|3.0|I love Coldplay and knowing that they were coming out with an EP. I decided to buy the regular CD with the extended play. I love most of the songs here and it did add to the Viva La Vida version. The only problem I got here is the remix with rapper Jay-Z on Lost+. I thought the song lost (no pun intend) it's meaning and became a joke. I honestly thought Jay-Z is trying to hard to get a new fan base by attaching his name to popular bands. It's like when he did an extended play with Linkin Park, who at the time was doing well in their career (and still is). I would of given this 5 out of 5 stars if it weren't for Jay-Z who \\"guest\\" starred on the EP.    I like the fact that this band is starting to feel comfortable in their own skin...And trying new things and still bring in old material. Well done, Coldplay!
B001QB9H10|1.0|Transporter 3's lead writer (Luc Besson) has a thing for redheads.<br /><br />I came to this conclusion after watching Transporter 3.  I'm a big fan of Besson's science fiction foray, [[ASIN:B0006GVJE4 The Fifth Element]], and all I could think as I watched the slinky, thickly accented Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) was how Transporter 3 would have been so much better if it had been Milla Jovovich in the role.<br /><br />That I was distracted by the stiff Rudakova's acting is a testament to how much the film insists on zooming in on her, letting her drone on and on in her broken English, and the endless patience that Frank Martin (Jason Statham) seems to have for what amounts to a rich brat in a miniskirt and heels.<br /><br />Oh right, the plot.  So anyway, Martin is a wheelman who does jobs with certain rules. These are all meant to ensure success in Martin's job as a wheelman.  By the time we reach Transporter 3, every one of those rules has been broken.<br /><br />And that's the problem.  The rules made Martin interesting. In Transporter 3, Martin has become a walking parody of himself, fetishized by the director to strip away (literally) everything likable about him, only to replace it with beefcake shots of Statham with his shirt off, whip-cut fight scenes that don't let us see his martial arts prowess, and aggravating supporting characters whom the Martin we know from the first movie would have left on the curb.<br /><br />The gimmick here is that Martin can't just run away from his job because a super-advanced device is connected to his wrist that will blow him up if he is more than 75 feet away from the car. For reasons that only make sense to movie villains, Martin is forced to drive Valentina to a variety of locations, during which they track him constantly.<br /><br />That's right, the bad guys track Martin's every move.  In fact, the movie is obsessed with keeping Martin in the car to the point that the entire universe seems hell bent on keeping him in it. Even the laws of physics are in on this cruel joke, which helpfully bends its laws to allow Frank to do ridiculous things like drive his car on two wheels, float it to the surface using air pressure from its tires alone, and land it on a moving train.<br /><br />The generic villain Johnson (Robert Knepper) is a victim of the So Bads.  As in, he's So Bad that:<br />... he kidnaps drunk college girls!<br />... he shoots his own men when they asks stupid questions!<br />... he's helping sneak toxic waste into Europe!<br /><br />That's right, uber-villains can now hit a new low: they're not just mean to you, they're mean to the environment!<br /><br />The movie just spirals from there.  Valentina, patently unlikable, somehow seduces Martin, who doesn't show the least bit of interest in her.  Given that the ransom picture of Valentina shows her in a schoolgirl's uniform, there's at least a ten-year difference between her and Martin.  Ick.<br /><br />There are so many logic fallacies that you have to wonder if Besson's just mocking his audience. Statham as Europe's answer to the Kung Fu martial artist is just plain awesome -- I loved him in [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]] and was willing to forgive the silliness of [[ASIN:B000BTITKS Transporter 2]] -- but this is too much.

0345495004|1.0|I feel ripped off by this nonsense. I've studied FLW & his architecture. I looked forward to reading this.  They were both fascinating people but this was handled like a dime novel. What a disappointment. Total Drivel & a pathetic waste of time!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It's wonderful that The Clash's \\"London Calling\\" CD has become an essential purchase for so many rock fans. And deservedly so. While leafing through Amazon's feature \\"customers who bought this item also bought...\\", I saw it's on the same must-have checklist as \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", and \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". Pretty heady company, and not exactly a foregone conclusion when originally released.    By the time \\"London Calling\\" came out, the Clash had outgrown their punk origins. They sounded more like a mainstream rock band, albeit one with extraordinary power, passion, conviction and purpose. What also separated them from the mainstream (and punk) scene of the day was their willingness to experiment with worldbeats and music as varied as ska, reggae and dub. This aspect would reach full flower on \\"Sandinista!\\" the following year.    I'd summarize their career like this: the debut album \\"The Clash\\" (1977) is a punk classic; \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\" and the EP \\"Black Market Clash\\" are relatively strong with many fine moments; \\"London Calling\\" is a flat-out masterpiece; \\"Sandinista!\\" is a massive, sprawling undertaking with hits and misses; \\"Combat Rock\\" is great; \\"Cut The Crap\\" is dismal.    \\"London Calling\\" benefitted greatly from the oversight of producer Guy Stevens (Mott the Hoople, Free) - a legendary British D.J., consultant to the stars (Rolling Stones, Who), and record company executive (most notably with Island). It's fair to say he was instrumental in both turning them loose, and reigning them in. Without his involvement on the follow-up, the band gave in to excess. Presumably the Clash invited him on board because Mick Jones was a charter member of the Mott fan club as a young man, and wanted his stamp put on it. Smart move.    The result is the perfect balance between their early punk and their later experimentalism. Nineteen splendid tracks. When issued on vinyl, this was a 2-record set - and I'd say the best 2-record set of all time. Many peoplewould point to double discs by the Beatles, Elton John, Prince, etc. - and they could make a persuasive case - but I think they all have their weak spots. \\"London Calling\\", on the other hand, is flawless - and stands alone at the head of the pack.    P.S. - Two final notes: this was released in England in December 1979, and issued stateside January 1980. It was therefore the last great classic of the 70's. When numerous rock mags overlooked this and named \\"London Calling\\" the \\"best album of the 80's\\" - they wrongly cheated Prince out of the top slot for \\"Purple Rain\\". And lastly: God bless Joe Strummer, wherever you are.
0312383320|4.0|This is a Between-the-Numbers book, not a great work of literature.  It's not meant to be deep or abiding, it's meant to be fun, entertaining, breezy, and distracting. It is all of that.  That's what I want from Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum.<br /><br />The adventure in this story, like all the other stories featuring Stephanie and Diesel, is improbable, and races along at breakneck speed.  It's a quick read, as are most Plum novels, but that's one of the things I like in them: I'm not making a week-long comittment to the book.<br /><br />Overall, the story is entertaining.  Loved Elmer the Fire Farter.  Well, I loved everyone else's reaction to him.  As Morelli points out, all guys really do wish they could fart fire, and that's what makes it funny.<br /><br />This is not a creepy book, nor a scary book. It's not meant to enlighten or educate and it doesn't offer any deep, abiding truths nor any illuminating new concepts. It's a good time, and that's what it's meant to be.  If you are a Plum fan, this book is worth the few hours it will take to read it, although considering what it is, it may be in your best interests to wait for the paperback before purchasing as I'm not sure anything this light and goofy is worth the cost of a hardback.
B000MGBRHC|5.0|A friend of mine in Europe gave me a link to a youtube video of their song, Garden's Tale.  Wow!  It was a great song, and one the strength of that one song, I bought the album; and I was not disappointed.  This is a great collection of songs.  Volbeat is hard to define - they are just not \\"a danish metal band\\" - their sound can't be that easily categorized.  Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devils songs really do express a multitude of genres.  If you read about them, you'll hear that they say their influences range from rockabilly to Metallica, and Elvis.  At first read you'd think their music would be a horrible melange of sounds; but they make it completely work.  Volbeat isn't afraid to throw some change-ups in their lineup, but really there isn't a single song on this album that I don't like.  They are all good.  If I have one complaint is that after listening to this album I went out and bought their other two, but had to pay a premium as their are not available direct from Amazon.

0061706620|5.0|As a dedicated Supernatural fan [...], this was a great book! I looked forward to the release for months and I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. I was constantly finding details that were consistant with the show, such as the first line, \\"I went to Missouri and I learned the truth,\\" and references to Cassie Robinson (the girl that Dean fell for and dumped him), and getting dates, places, and names accurately. Of course, scouring my memory for details of the show that they noted in the book, and there were really very few errors. This was great, especially because The Supernatural Book of Monsters, Ghosts, Demons and Ghouls disappointed me because of the numerous errors, not to mention the fact that it didn't seem to be able to make up its mind on who was narrating the book. The John Winchester Journal also had many accurate references to real-life occurances, such as Joseph Figlock and quotes and sections from many well-known grimoires. This one is definitely five stars!
B00005NB8K|5.0|If you were there and can remember being there then you can relate to this movie. If you were not there then it won't make a lot of sense. The late 60's and early 70's were a crazy time and this movie shows that to the extreme. Val Kilmer does an outstanding job of portraying Morrison and Oliver Stone did a great job of setting the mood of rock and roll during those years. I think Jim would approve....maybe!
076535618X|5.0|To get the most out of THE LAST COLONY, you should read [[ASIN:1596061308 Old Man's War]] first, and then THE GHOST BRIGADES, both very excellent novels, and which, between them, introduce you to Scalzi's universe and bring you up to date in it.  This is important, because unlike the relatively static universes of other series, such as that of Asimov's FOUNDATION or Weber's Honorverse, Scalzi's universe continues to develop with each novel.  (It may not in the next one, ZOE'S TALE which I am looking forward to reading soon.)    John Perry returns from OMW and Jane Sagan from OMW and GB, and Zoe from GB, along with several other old friends and some new ones.  Like the other two before it, LC is a real page-turner, difficult to put down and leaving you eager to read more Scalzi.    But since John Scalzi can't write them as fast as we can read them, I can recommend another, and very different 'Last Colony.'  David Weber has given us OFF ARMAGEDDON REEF and its sequels, BY SCHISM RENT ASUNDER and BY HERESIES DISTRESSED which are also great fun.  Buy them all, and enjoy!    [...]
B00197POXG|3.0|I purchased this product in lieu of keeping all of the video tapes I had (for space reasons).  It comes in a compact case which I like.  However, it is difficult sometimes to access the DVD I want with so many of them crammed into a small space.  Also, the front and back of the case are glued on and one side was coming off and I had to glue it back on again.  After reading other people's reviews before purchasing the product, I was wary of the sound quality.  I have had some problems after only watching the first 3 DVD's with them skipping or not starting up correctly.  After ejecting the DVD and re-starting it, the problem seems to go away.  I really wish they had close captioning on these DVD's though.

This is the film that carved out the SF niche that has become the blockbuster series of end-of-the-world adventures that should really make you think about that computer you're typing on right now.    Pull the plug on your PC before it's too late, but order 'The Terminator' before you do!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Pursuit of Happynes\\". I thought that it was a good movie, that was very simple to enjoy. It is about a man who, against all odds, makes a name for himself in the world. It was one of those movies that is just plain frustrating. Things just continued to go from bad to worse. All the while, the acting was extremely convincing. There is not much to say about this great movie, so I will keep this review short. I think that everyone can get something out of this movie. You will not regret watching this movie, several times.
B001AACEP8|3.0|Overall the album is pretty good with a mix of rock style songs and dance-style music.  Although, buyer beware because a number of songs that have what I guess somebody deemed offensive words scratched out radio-edit style.  I find it rather annoying and unnecessary but ultimately disappointing given there is no indication here that these songs are the \\"Clean\\" or \\"Radio Edit\\" versions.
1401300529|1.0|This is not a book recounting the history of the Korean War. It is much more akin to a lawyer's brief; it argues the author's often biased point of view without providing any contrasting facts which might not support his view of events. Moreover, the book is badly disorganized, beginning with the Chinese crossing the Yalu River, an event which occurred after many months of war up and down the penisula. But it is the unbalanced story he tells that is so infuriating. If you want a knowledgeable, balance view of history, buy a book by an historian.

B000002H4Q|5.0|The Cure-Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me ****1/2<br /><br />Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is easily the Cures most ambitious and adventurous album to date. In fact it might be the Cures only ambitious and adventurous album to date. In Robert Smith's long and lets be honest sometimes dull career, Kiss Me (x3) was really the only time he ever tried to look on the bright side of things. Clearly he never stayed happy and used his amazing 'this mood will self-destruct in 10...9...8' ability to take what should have been the happiest album of the Cures career and turn it into possibly one of the three saddest albums ever recorded. Not that there is anything wrong with that because really would any of us buy into Smith making a totally happy album...no probably not.<br /><br />Ambitious, and adventurous, right...right...right. Horns! A horn section, and not just any run of the mill horn section, not a horn machine from the 1980's (no save that for the drum machine sounding drums) but a real life, good sounding horn section. During 'Torture' the horns are introduced to the audience subtly as to give the effect of was that for real and then you think they are gone. But they are reintroduced through the entire album like a bridge repeated through an entire Pete Townsend record.<br /><br />Dance music....hum? For the cure, or big mistake? well neither but somehow they work. 'Why Can't I Be You?' somehow by chance became one of the biggest dance floor anthems of the late 1980's. Can you believe that? But don't be fooled by the cheerful melodies, and the abrasive brass section. No, this is one of the darkest and ominous tracks on the album. Lyrically it is almost disturbing, but a brilliant move on Smiths part none the less.<br /><br />But what is best album Kiss Me is the wide range in which the album appeals to. The slow drown of the semi-title track which opens the album to the middle eastern sitar flavoured 'If Only Tonight We Could Sleep' or the mega-hit and all time greatest cure track 'Just Like Heaven.' Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me is a near perfect record and considering the year in which it was released that is quite the feet.ss Me Kiss Me is a near perfect record and considering the year in which it was released that is quite the feet.

B0012Q732O|2.0|This film is the perfect example of how ALL the best moments were shown during the two to three minute trailer for the film. Looking for a awesome showdown between man and a sabretooth tiger? Don't look here for it. Looking for awesome fights between man and mammoths? Nope, not here either. What you will find is a drawn out, pretty boring scene that includes giant angry chickens and a lame plot with enough holes to drive a mack truck through. I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through this \\"film\\" a second time.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. If you like swashbuckling, seafaring adventure, this can't be beat. Russell Crowe is great as Captain Jack Aubrey and is assisted by a very good supporting cast. This movie is set during England's war with France in 1805. It is about a smaller British warships' attempt to elude and eventually capture a much larger warship of Napolean's Navy. If you are a fan of this type of movie, don't miss this one.
0316017922|5.0|This is a good book and well worth reading.  I listened to the audio edition read by the author.    The author looks at extremely successful individuals and successful groups and asks what hidden advantage did these people have available to them.  He does not minimize their talent.  He acknowledges that without ability and hard work it is rare for any individual to  succeed.  The focus is to what other hidden factors were involved that made the difference.  He also looks at some who have failed.    With groups such as Canadian hockey players, statistical analysis disclosed the hidden factor which was date-of-birth creating an age-differential within groups of children born within one year of each other.  I will not go into the details but would suggest the evidence seems irrefutable.    There were many more examples and it appears from some other reviews that many of these examples have threatened some sacred cows.  Many people like to think that when they succeed in life it was due only to their efforts and that when others fail it is all their fault.  To contend otherwise, as this book does, is threatening.  It goes contrary to the political philosophy in some circles in America that we all get exactly what we deserve in life --- that the luck of being in the right place at the right time plays no part.    This book is a simplified distillation of extremely detailed and published studies of the groups done by mathematicians, scientists and even large corporations like Boeing.  It is an entertaining easy read because the author does not dive into the statistics or minutia of these studies but instead goes to the human side.  The material is believable because it is built on a strong foundation.    This book picks at another politically incorrect issue. We don't like to think that, as children, we are shaped by our culture to such an extent that we may fail.  It is disconcerting to think that a nation's culture and language could cause its pilots to be unsafe.  Whyare pilots from this nation forbidden to speak their native language in flight even on their own national airline?  Read the book and you will find out.    You will also find out why one slave auction in Jamaica over 200 years ago made a profound difference in this author's life.  This is a very entertaining book with a deeper message.
B000H6H81Q|5.0|My son has about 70 or 80 of these figurines.  Models is probably more apt to describe these toys because most of them are very detailed and well made.  Solid dense plastic like all the other Schleich animals and products.  Beware a 4 year old hurling this thing is dangerous and could cause some serious damage, they weigh a ton.  Fantastic toys, He loves to match his animals up to his various movies. This one goes good for the kid who likes the movie Ice Age.  Well worth the money for a quality toy.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth. I was so sure that no sequel could be as good. The four vs. five star reviews for the two books seemed to bear that out. Then I read it and realized I loved it just as much as the first  book. I found myself slowing down in the middle, hoping to make it last longer, knowing how much I would miss these people when the book ended. I hope there are more in this genre coming down the road soon, as I proved to myself that I can love books written in this time period and still want more.
142720599X|5.0|Let me first say that Janet Evanovich at her worst is quite often more entertaining than many other authors at their best.  Several of her last books seemed to lack the \\"joi de vivre\\" that some of her earlier novels had, but with \\"Plum Spooky\\" she is back in rare form.  I laughed my way through the book, enjoying every minute of Stephanie's newest adventures.  This is the perfect book for a bad day, a rainy day, a day when you need a little laughter in your life.

Fans of the best of Minette Walters and Ruth Rendell should not miss Sophie Hannah!
B00005JOA0|5.0|I almost gave up on this BBC drama. It started out slow, Mrs. Graham (Fitzgerald) appeared to be an unsympathetic character with a prickly attitude who is not only a loner but also ridiculously overprotective of her son. It was hard to watch Fitzgerald in any scene-her actions were so overly dramatic it seemed the actress didn't try to make Mrs. Graham feminine or even likable--that is, until we're allowed to read her journal. What follows is a three-part series, chronicling Mrs. Graham's horrible sham of a marriage to an alcoholic misogynist expertly played by Rupert Graves. Without giving away too much of the plot, each scene intensifies the brutality of Graham's marriage: the verbal abuse, marital rape, and adultery she experiences allthewhile trying to shield her son from his fathers' sadistic behavior. It's a disturbing story about domestic violence but also the strength of virtue.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I've seen this movie many times over. Now I have it on blu ray and I am truly impressed by the richness of color, and the sound. In addition to being a first class movie, it is now a true delight to the eyes and ears. Very thankful for the blu ray version. A must addition to your blu ray collection.
B000VAUFZ4|3.0|I liked the movie so I read the book. The book is strange and philosophical and much less concrete than the movie. For now I'm going to chalk it up to being some German thing.    The story follows Bastian, an awkward bookworm of about 11. He visits a book store and finds a book called, \\"The Neverending Story\\" He knows that he must have the book and so he steals it and locks himself into the attic of his school to hide from the law and read. The story he is reading is printed in red and green, just like the book we are reading. Gradually Bastian notices that characters in the story react to things he does and realizes that the fate of the fictional (or not so fictional) world he is reading about hangs on his actions. This is the first half of the book. It plays with breaking the fourth wall.    In the second half of the world the fourth wall is broken. Bastian is in the world of ideas. He can trade memories for wishes that come true as he wishes them. So this explores identity. The world of Fantastica is like a medieval painting. Gargoyles etc come from here and there. Anywhere you look archetypes are playing out morals and ideas. But when you step back and look at the whole picture you see that there are only these small thoughts and scenes. Anyone of them is more planned out than is the picture as a whole. This didn't work for me in book form. By the end of the book I didn't care what happened to any of the characters.    I think that the approach here is very much a love it, hate it one. I don't even know that you would know if the book is for you from reading the first few chapters. For me monotony set in about a third of the way through. It is very tenuous and has philosophical aspirations. If you saw the movie and liked it, that is no guarantee of liking the book. My recommendation is to read this only if someone who knows you has pointed you toward it.

B000MVNAXQ|5.0|Stardust tells the story of people mixing with the fairy world circa 1830's England. In the village of Wall there is a gate that is guarded and has been guarded continuously for centuries, because the gate is an entrance to the world of Fairy. Every nine years a fairy market is held on the other side of the gate. At the begining of Stardust, Dunstan Thorne from the village of Wall falls in love with and sexes a fairy girl. Nine months later a baby in a basket is pushed through the gate with a nametag labeled Tristan Thorne.<br /><br />Tristan grows up unaware of his parentage. He and half the village are in love with the very beautiful Victoria Forester. One night as he walks her home he begs for a kiss. She refuses. They see a shooting star and on a whim Victoria promises Tristan any request including marriage if he brings her the fallen star.... which landed on the other side of the wall. It is clear (to us) that Victoria is only joking with Tristan, but 17 year old Tristan takes the quest very seriously. So Tristan sets off on his journey into fairy land.<br /><br />Hence flows the rest of the story as Tristan finds the star, which or rather who turns out to be a young looking and ageless woman, and trys to bring her back to Victoria while protecting her from other interested parties with less picturesque plans.<br /><br />Stardust is a cute little fairy story. Tristan's naievety and kind heart carry him through his brushes with the strange world he finds on the other side of the wall. Things end happily if not in the way anyone expected.<br /><br />Stardust is a fairy tale for adults, and caters to Gaiman fans. Some of the characters overlap Sandman and other comic books. But Stardust takes place in a selfcontained world and the story flows well, so not having read a whole bunch of comics won't keep you from following the story and enjoying it.<br /><br />I recommend Stardust. It is a sweet little fairy story.
B0014KD46W|5.0|I agree with the other reviews that state that this cd reminds them of Winwood's early days. Although some songs do seem a bit repetitious, each is enjoyable in it's own way. Winwood's voice seems deeper and raspier but I think is an improvement. If you are a Winwood fan you won't be disappointed in your purchase.
B001QRYT58|4.0|The seven songs on \\"Deluxe EP\\" by Duffy aren't quite as strong as those that appear on her stellar ROCKFERRY, but they are certainly great examples of the modern soul sound.  The standout here is definitely the Burt Bacharach tune \\"Please Stay,\\" featuring Duffy's charged vocals at their finest; the Duffy original \\"Breaking My Own Heart\\" follows a close second.  \\"Rain On Your Parade\\" sounds like it could have been a James Bond theme song from the seventies (I mean that as a compliment), and \\"Stop\\" will have you sashaying your hips (even if you're a guy...yes, I did it, and I'm proud of it).  \\"Fool For You\\" is a bit cliched, but with Duffy's vocals, it's a fine tune. All of the songs here (including the \\"Mercy\\" remix, of course) are themed: a heart breaking, a soul recovering...except for the final track, \\"Enough Love,\\" which is a bit too kitschy to be enjoyable.  It's a shame, really, that the EP ends on such a positive note; we like Duffy best when she's unhappy.  Or, if she feels compelled to sing happy songs, at least make them ones that aren't as sappy as \\"Enough Love.\\"<br /><br />Combining the passion of soul, the rhythm of Motown, all of it sung in a voice that is uniquely her own, Duffy represents a welcomed breath of fresh air in the contemporary pop world.  I myself am proof of this: I rarely listen to popular records anymore, but when I first heard \\"Mercy,\\" I took notice.  Of course, I did the same with Amy Winehouse, and have since come to regret it...but nobody's perfect.  And Duffy is definitely a more talented artist: she manages to live in the songs she sings/writes.  In my humble opinion, that is the sign of a true musical artist.

B0014I4KIK|4.0|I don't pay much attention to pop music, aside from what plays over the radio where I work (and even then, I keep the radio tuned to a station that also plays copious amounts of Springsteen and Zeppelin).  I heard \\"Mercy,\\" of course; I think I even remember seeing the video once, when flipping through the channels on my TV.  And every time \\"Mercy\\" would come on, I would listen.  I finally got around to getting the whole album (we've all made that mistake before, buying the album a bit too early).  Naturally, I wasn't let down.<br /><br />What ROCKFERRY lacks in originality, it makes up for in genuine talent.  Granted, the album isn't AIMING for originality; Duffy and her producers deftly blend Motown, soul, and contemporary pop music into what can only be described as a sonic delight.  The melodies are familiar, but also purely enjoyable.  The lyrics (thanks to Duffy, who co-wrote every tune here) are strong.  The \\"wall of sound\\" (once loved, then reviled, and now loved again) is perfect; in fact, if there's a flaw here, it's that the instrumentation comes off as TOO perfect.  It should be troubled and flawed, just like Duffy's vocals.<br /><br />That's what drives this album of course: Duffy herself, not just her writing, but her vocals.  She is one hell of a singer; she manages to live in the songs, something few pop vocalists rarely do these days.  The title track opens the album on a high note: when she breaks into the screamed vocals near the end of the song, shivers run down the spine.  The same thing happens on \\"Warwick Avenue.\\"  And it continues.  Sure, some songs stand out more than others (in a rare feat, \\"Mercy,\\" the hit single, is actually one of the strongest tunes here), but they are all enjoyable, delectable little nuggets of musical integrity.  It's an homage to the past firmly rooted in the present, and powered by those amazing vocals.  Duffy's popularity may last, it may not; in the music business, pure talent does not guarantee financial success.  But whether her next album does as well or not, we can rest assured that Duffy is an extremely talented singer/songwriter, who has something to say, and an incredible voice to say it with.next album does as well or not, we can rest assured that Duffy is an extremely talented singer/songwriter, who has something to say, and an incredible voice to say it with.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|As a guy that prides himself on never crying during a movie, I came darn close during this film. I can't really explain it, but this movie moves you. Maybe it's the universality of it all, the characters, or the humanness of it all, even where humanity seems to be only a shell of itself. Some say it's a story that warns us about our environment, being a kid-friendly version of 'An Inconvenient Truth,\\" but it's more than that, because this movie is more about what makes us human.<br /><br />You see, around the year 2103, Fred Willard is the president of a company that's achieved global domination, but this world is quickly on the environmental downturn, so he sends humanity off on a five-year cruise, which as the scope of the problem worsens, quickly becomes 700 years. So around the year 2803, long after many of robots sent to clean the know global garbage dump known as Earth have broken down and gone silent, Wall-E is still diligently doing his job as if he had started yesterday. But even though he stacks haunting skyscrapers of garbage up, Wall-E is inquisitive about his world, picking up the various items that interest him, one of these being an old video tape that managed to survive, which depicts the companionship he longs for. But even with all this underlying sadness, there is hope for all with the arrival of EVE. Make no mistake it, in terms of quality, the first half hour of this movie could be the best EVER in filmmaking. All achieved with very little use of words, letting the emotions speak for themselves.<br /><br />But don't think the rest of the movie is dull, because while different, it certainly is good also. Let me also praise the stunning visuals, which look even better in Blu-Ray, the music, Ben Burtt, and director Andrew Stanton, who is so far the best talent in Hollywood today.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not sure if I'm ready to call this the best animated film of all time, but it certainly is topping my list of best film of 2008, for now. Even with all the hype, Wall-E is an underrated movie for the whole family that provokes thought, and shows us a little of what it means to be human, without being one himself.an underrated movie for the whole family that provokes thought, and shows us a little of what it means to be human, without being one himself.
B00003CX5P|5.0|We'd been looking locally, without luck, to complete our Star Wars collection of 6 - the old and the new in one set - and I was grateful to find this one, the last needed to complete the set, on Amazon.com.  I won't \\"rate\\" the movie itself - we're Star Wars fans and love every one of the movies in it's own way -- but will say I like dealing with Amazon.com in general.  Things largely ship when scheduled, and you get a timely notice if there are delays.  \\"Stuff\\" in general is what the write-up says it is and arrives in good condition....  This DVD \\"Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace\\" was no exception.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|Maybe it was the reviews, or those horrid ads, but somehow I figured this movie was going to be terrible, and gave it 15 minutes. But against all expectations, not only did I get through the movie, but it was pretty good. Granted, it is a bit formulamatic, predictable, and some of the jokes fell flat, but it succeeded where you'd least expect. In fact, it was sweet, engaging, it did have some great jokes, but also good performances and a soundtrack that anchors it all.<br /><br />It mostly rides on the concept of missing out on your dream by *this* much, leaving you with only a bunch of 'what-ifs.' In this case, it's a rocker who missed his chance on being part of one of the biggest groups in the world. A deleted scene with former-Beatle Pete Best anchors in this fact, and the concept actually is quite interesting in of itself. Add to that themes of moving on, maturity, and following your dreams, and you're hooked.<br /><br />Another thing that is surprising is characterization, as you see this motley crew who make up a band develop and mature through their journey on the road to stardom. Rainn Wilson, Emma Stone and even Christina Applegate are great in their roles, and bring something extra to their characters that probably wouldn't have been there otherwise. Teddy Geiger is also a good actor, playing an emoish kid who through his journey develops into a sunny pop/rock artist. And this is where the soundtrack comes in, because even though it doesn't sound all that great by itself, it sounds pretty impressive within the movie.<br /><br />Overall, you should at least check it out as a rental, and come into the movie with an open mind. You might just like what you hear and see in this underrated flick. Granted, it's not amazing, but it is worth a watch, and your support. Dwight can't stay in his cubicle forever...

B0000025T6|1.0|Without a doubt, if Bruce Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\",were to be looped and played in the depths of hell, all of Satan's victims would scream for God's mercy.<br />In \\"Nebraska\\", too many of Springsteen's songs play at a tempo not suitable for a man with limited singing ability. Without a catchy melody, or any accompaniment, the slow and depressing songs make you cringe with every note and new verse. It's like listening to fingernails raking a chalkboard.<br />Clint Eastwood said, \\"A man has to know his limitations.\\" Springsteen should have watched the movie. His scratchy and washed-out voice is not able to deliver on its own. If you've ever listened to Springsteen's, \\"Mary, My Queen of Arkansas,\\" you'll know what I mean. That song came from his second album. Had a good friend advised him then, Springsteen wouldn't have put us through Nebraska.<br />(As an aside, with as big as he is, Clarence Clemons needs to be the enforcer in the group. Any time the, \\"Boss,\\" tries to sing on his own the big man should whack him on the side of his head with his sax.)<br />Put aside the dull and banal rythms and you have to ask yourself, once you listen to the bleak lyrics, why any one would want to listen to such an album? It's like looking at carnage after a train wreck. After getting through it, I sweated, convinced myself I was suicidal, and made sure my Xanax pills were with me at all times. If you seek music that is uplifting, this is antithetical to anything you've ever listened to before.<br />\\"Nebraska,\\" is all gloom and doom. It's dark without hope. The darlings of the left have tried to prop up the album as some type of historic ground breaking work of art. Tell me where? That's nothing but a payback for all of Springsteen's political activist work. Somehow, without the aid of an education, the Jersey wharf rat learned quickly how to further his career through his associations.<br />With this album, if you strip away your bias for him, you can't help but hope and pray Springsteen gets some voice lessons or never reads another Steinbeck novel.<br />A melancholy lyric coughed out by an overreaching singer is a lethal combination.lessons or never reads another Steinbeck novel.

B001CTA1S4|5.0|At Saint Nicholas Church School, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Streep) is the principal.  She is an old-school nun who sees sin just about everywhere she looks.  Sister James (Adams) is a new and impressionable nun who is very idealistic.  When she sees something that may be inappropriate between Father Brendan Flynn (Hoffman), a progressive priest, and a student, she confides in Sister Aloysius.  Sister Aloysius then takes on Father Flynn, who professes his innocence.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" is an intense drama with amazing performances.  Streep, Hoffman, Adams, and Davis (as the boy's mother) all deliver Oscar nominated performances.  Those nominations are all well deserved.  The story works so well because of the doubt that is present.  Did Father Flynn act inappropriately? Or is Sister Aloysius just on a witch hunt, seeing what she wants to see?  The movie forces the viewer to think and come to their own conclusions.  This is a great film, and is definitely worth seeing.

0684865130|1.0|I read this a few years ago as it was on a list of the best novels of the 20th century. Awful! While there are a few parts that are humorous, I thought the book as a whole was horribly tedious. If a student wrote a paper/essay like this he/she would get batted across the head. Verbosity reigns supreme in Heller's work, with tedium a close second. The attempts at humor are feeble. I suppose in the interest of being well-read it might behoove some to read it...certainly not for enjoyment. A shame really, because the basic premise is interesting and, yes, thought provoking. Perhaps I am in the minority, but I don't understand all the hype.
B000002H6C|5.0|Like the title says, this is the last great album they recorded, albeit the recording was Bass Guitar shy! The songs, however, leave a mark on the metal industry that is rarely touched. The lyrics and the music are simply phenomenal. So many reviews have been done before, so if you want more music like this, see Iron Maiden, Iced Earth, Nevermore, Opeth, and the list goes on. I just wish the radio stations would play more bands like these, and not just at midnight on a Friday night, after the majority have spent all week at work, and have such busy lives with our families.

When I first started this DVD I had trouble even getting through the level one workout and now I fly through it! I'm a little nervous about trying levels two and three, but I really feel like this DVD will make a big difference in the long run :) I feel like I've become a spokesperson for this DVD...I talk about it all the time at work and I've already gotten two of the other girls I work with to buy it!

B0000CEB4V|5.0|You have Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Jeff Lynn, Eric Clapton, Gary B. from Procol Harem, Andy Fairweather-Lowe, Klaus Voorman, Joe Brown and a host of other killer musicians performing George Harrison songs. Need I say more? By the time Billy preston gets through with \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", if you don't have tears in your eyes, I would say you're not human. It's really a Video you just have to see and hear.
B00127RAJY|4.0|There are three of us doing the video as a group and we LOVE it.  It is just enough that you are able to do it and quite enough if that is all you have time to do that day!  We like the 20 minute intervals and the different levels. Great video.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I loved this movie.  It has everything: adventure, comedy, action, treason, magic... and it is a great story.   I loved the song from Wizard of Oz and how it is a theme for this movie.      I don't know if this story really happened, but it is a great story.  If it didn't happen, I'm glad somebody wrote it, and it happens on the screen.  Apparently the mistreatment of Australian natives and the arrogance of the Australian Government to rip half-breed children away from their aborigine parents really happened.  According to the movie, the Australian Government apologized for the mistreatment of its aborigines many years after it occurred.    I cried the first time I saw this movie.  I love it when a movie is so good that it can make me cry.  This movie made me cry several times.  So I went to see it again, to see if the first time I saw it it was really so good.  It was really so good.      So I went to see it again a third time, and a fourth time, and I think a fifth time, too.  And I cry each time. And I can't get over it, I cry each time I see the movie.      I love Nicole Kidman.  I wish I could kiss her, she is so great.  She steals the show.  And Hugh Jackman... he is also so great he steals the show.  And the little boy is fantastic... he is magic... he steals the show too.  And King George... he steals the show, just standing there... A show where 4 actors steal the show, that's a show!      I am going to place my order now for the Blu-Ray of this movie.  It won't be released until next month, but I want to order it now.  I don't have many movies in Blu-Ray, but I have a small collection of Blu-Rays of the very special movies I love, like Big Fish, Phantom of the Opera, Finding Neverland, Across the Universe... and now without any doubt, Australia.      I really loved this movie.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is for sure the best album this band has ever made and quite possibly the best ever. It's been 8 long years since this album came out and I haven't heard anything that sounds even somewhat like it. This album combines humor and nonsense with serious political ideas and views. It is amazing because it is so radically different from anything made before then. It not only has the hits Toxicity and Chop Suey, but also the melodic Ariels, and crazy quick songs like X, Jet Pilot, and Shimmy. I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!
0399229191|5.0|Farm animals and repitition--what more could you ask for?  A raised up spider web, that's what!  It's grey, and sort of bumps out on each page.  After I showed the bumpy web to my 19month old, he showed me that all the gray stuff was bumped out (the fly, etc.) how fun.  Of course, there is a spider web, and a fly.  It's subtle, but of course, the fly is on every page, then is caught in the web, then is gone.  But, that is the way these things work, and they don't actually show the fly getting eaten.

B000002K9N|5.0|\\"You see the show? And the men answered, 'Yeah, That Sinatra...he really put on a show.' Which may not be the best sum up in the world, but then you can't expect, much more from someone who's just been through 90 minutes with the best singing man in town.\\" ~ Stan Cornyn ~<br /><br />\\"How did all these people get in my room?\\" asked Ol' Blue Eyes as he opens this fabulous live concert and starts singing \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and ended the song with \\"And don't tell your Papa.\\"<br /><br />Frank Sinatra performing in a live concert with Count Basie and his Orchestra conducted by a fine arranger/orchestrator Quincy Jones whom Sinatra described as \\"a very talented man and one of the brightest stars in the composing business\\" is one of the best things that ever happened to the Chairman's illustrious musical career. He was such a terrific stage performer who did not leave his audience bored and yawning. He kept them alive, focused and responsive while entertaining them with his wit and exceptional performances.<br /><br />\\"Sinatra At The Sands\\" is one of the best concerts in the history of live recordings that I wholeheartedly recommend for your listening enjoyment. Listening to it is like being physically present in that grand concert. The sound quality is top-notch. For a live concert, Sinatra's performances are nothing short of splendid, Quincy Jones' chart works are the best, Count Basie and his Orchestra's playing is sublime, and his long-time pianist Bill Miller's accompaniments are outstanding. All of these are the very reasons why this is one of the most sought-after Sinatra recordings of all-time, and a must-have to any Sinatra aficionado. Thank you to a very kind and selfless friend for this precious CD that I enjoy listening to every so often. (I can't thank you enough).<br /><br />If I have to single out a stand out performance, it would be \\"Don't Worry 'Bout Me\\" which he described as \\"one of the Great American standards of our repertoire in this nation.\\" Here, he suddenly became the Serious Sinatra rendering the song the way it should be sung and making it the most emotional highlight from this concert. Another round of applause was heard and someone shouted, \\"Bravo!\\" And he ended with...\\"Thank you...it's a marvelous song, a really great standard.\\" He first recorded this achingly beautiful song under the orchestration of Gordon Jenkins in one of his concept albums, [[ASIN:B00005UMTD Where Are You?]]<br /><br />\\"All Of Me\\" is purely instrumental where you can truly appreciate Count Basie and His Orchestra's distinctive sound. It was executed astoundingly with the Big Band splendor and it elicited rounds of applause from the audience.<br /><br />Sinatra's performance on \\"Angel Eyes\\" is also remarkable. These are his words before singing this song...\\"You're a delightful audience, ladies and gentlemen. I thank you and I hope it doesn't come as a shock, but I'm through!\\" So true with the last line of this song.....\\"Excuse me while I disappear.\\"atra rendering the song the way it should be sung and making it the most emotional highlight from this concert.

B0013ND30M|5.0|My all-time favorite Disney movie on DVD!!!  This version is so colorful and the sound quality is excellent, compared to our VHS tape of the same movie.  I'm glad there are people out there who feel it's important to keep these movies on the shelves for future generations to enjoy!  You'd never guess it was made so long ago.  Up against Wall-E and Madagascar, these Disney classics still hold their own.

0553381687|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is the lead novel in a series that includes Clash of Kings, Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows.  The next novel, A Dance with Dragons, should be out in 2009 or 10.<br /><br />This is my favorite fantasy series.  I rate it very highly.  Marin creates believable characters.  Sometimes the good guys do ridiculously stupid things and sometimes the bad guys do horrific stuff but you understand why even if you don't approve.  You never get the impression that something happens simply because the plot demands it.  He likes surprises; he kills off characters (including the one I thought was going to be the hero) with both verve and aplomb.  He redeemed someone who seemed to be the most evil character in the series.  The plot is fascinating and complex, but it's worth reading not only for that but also to try to figure out what Martin will do next.<br /><br />The series is set on the obligatory feudal planet; most of the action takes place in Westeros.  The first family we meet are the Starks, who live in the cold north (the seasons are longer than ours).  A huge wall made of ice marks the territory of the Night Watch.  Their job is to keep the Others who live beyond it from attacking Westeros itself.  Most of the first three books track the children of that family (ranging in age from about 3 to teenagers) as the government of Westeros begins to lose control and various claimants appear for the throne.  One thing I like about the series is that, especially in Clash of Kings, we see what it takes to rule this land.  So often in fantasy we see the competition for the throne without seeing what it actually takes to govern.<br /><br />Martin has created several religions for this series.  There is, as in Tolkien, the sense that \\"modern\\" events are hugely influenced by things that happened in the past.  Lyanna Stark vanished about 14 years ago shortly before she was to wed Robert Baratheon, who in his fury unseated the Targaryen dynasty that had ruled Westeros for so long. Many people still believe that the Targaryen Crown Prince kidnapped her and few know what happened to her. This caused a war whose effects are still very much felt in Westeros.<br /><br />Unknown to most of the characters, there is a surviving Targaryen:  Daenerys.  Her family originally came to power because they had dragons and could control them.  Dany has dragons--indeed, their return to this world seems to have awakened more magic.  She's still young, but she hopes to retake her family's throne.<br /><br />The series also has humor and wit.  So often, in my experience, fantasy fiction doesn't.<br /><br />I have to warn you:  this is addictive stuff.  But it's GOOD addictive stuff.  Check it out.  And when you've read all the books published so far, there's a board of fans waiting to discuss it with you online..

B00111YM5G|2.0|I didn't expect much from this movie. It was weird and it was shot in a really weird way. It was straight to DVD but I thought I would give it a shot and bought it. I must say it was entertaining but I don't think that it is for everybody and I am not sure that everybody would like it as much as I did. If the story hadn't had some of the suprises it did I probably would have rated it a 1 but it was interesting enough and unpredictable enough for me to actually recommend it to some sci-fi fans and fans of other movies about archangels and that type of genre.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Lost makes a big comeback in this abbreviated 4th season. In fact, the story line seems to have benefitted by having only thirteen episodes to tell it. Where the preceding season seemed to meander a bit and sometimes lose its narrative focus, here many of the dangling threads from Season 3 are gracefully resolved and the expansion of the settings from the island to the offshore freighter produce a consistently strong series of episodes.<br /><br />Don't miss \\"The Constant,\\" in which the Desmond Hume character assumes center stage and the actor playing him gives an Emmy-worthy performance. From there on the narrative gathers momentum and does something virtually impossible: make Linus a sympathetic character. The season finale episodes \\"There's No Place Like Home (Pt. 1 & 2),\\" are a match for anything the cast and crew have ever done on this series. Part 2 in particular is riveting. In fact, it's one of the best things I have ever seen on television, period. An awful lot of story lines get resolved in eighty minutes, yet every primary character in that episode takes on almost mythic dimensions. The finale is cinematic in its sweep and its eventfulness, in the best possible way.<br /><br />I have to single out Michael Emerson as a tremendous actor, who never chews the scenery but effortlessly commands the screen, along with some of the supporting actors, such as Jeremy Davies (Faraday), Jeff Fahey (Lepidus, the copter pilot) and the superb Kevin Durand (Keamy), who add complexity and depth to the story line and are all sensational. But Season 4 really begins and ends with Ian Cusick (Desmond), whose devastating phone call in \\"The Constant\\" and his emotional reunion in the finale provide the emotional arc of the season and point the way forward to Season 5.<br /><br />This is some of the best television going. The BluRay version is also sensational in quality. The whole thing is not to be missed. For me, this is one of the great series in television history.<br /><br />Only one thing: something has to be done about Jack's beard.to be done about Jack's beard.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|This is a very good movie. I loved the casting and also loved the realism. Ridley Scott is at the top of his game (when isn't he) and so is Crowe and DiCaprio. This is a tense thriller but for the most part it is a really good realistic action movie. I will buy it, recommend it and watch it again.

Mr. Hazlitt cuts through the political rhetoric to help normal citizens (such as myself) understand these issues.  In the book he talks a great deal about taking a full view of how economic policies can effect not just the industry they are regulating, but the broader effect on the whole economy.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|\\"The Edge\\" is a great, on the edge-of-your-seat bear attack movie, at par with \\"Man In the Wilderness\\" and \\"Night of the Grizzly\\".  If this does not give you nightmares, nothing will.  Anthony Hopkins & Alec Baldwin are at their best.  The wilderness shots are breathtaking and humbling.  It is a struggle of mind over matter and shows how the determination to survive is powerful for both human and beast.

I miss the Harry Potter books and even though I knew they had to come to an end, I really wish there were more of them coming.  I can only hope JK Rowling will write more books like this.  At least it brings us back to the wizarding world even if it isnt to Hogwarts.
0812979184|4.0|Imagine you are a turkey being fed comfortably on one of those mass production turkey farms. You may well assume that the good food, good company, and pleasant surroundings will go on forever.  If you are a quant-savvy turkey, you might even gobble together a mathematical model that predicts good times well into the future, beyond not just Thanksgiving, but past Christmas and New Years as well.  Suddenly in November, unexpectedly, with life-changing consequences...things change.  You just didn't see it coming.  Pass the cranberry sauce.<br /><br />Financial planners, economists and other more sophisticated turkeys don't see it coming either, argues author Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  His book highlights the danger of the unexpected.  The unexpected will happen even if we have a comfortable model predicting only minor changes.  After such a \\"black swan\\" catches us by surprise, we use our flawed hindsight to decide how we could have predicted the disaster using a better model.  We are kidding ourselves, insists Taleb.  We need better strategies to live in a world where truly random, unpredictable events occur.  He goes to some trouble in this book, and his previous [[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]], to educate us.<br /><br />The flawed basis of many formal models is \\"the great intellectual fraud\\" of the bell curve.  We learn that highly constrained variables like height and weight cluster around an average and that extreme variations from the average are unlikely.  We just aren't going to meet anybody that's half a foot or half a mile tall.  These \\"Mediocristan\\" models are fine until we misapply their assumptions to unconstrained \\"Extremistan\\" phenomena like stock values, book sales and such.  We are slow to see this problem.  We persistently commit the \\"Ludic Fallacy,\\" clinging to our formal models because they seem more real to us than the messy, real-world events they are meant to explain.  Taleb illustrates this point with examples ranging from the events of 9/11 to the \\"off model\\" problems that cost casinos money.  S. I. Hyakawa warned us in the early `70s that \\"the map is not the territory,\\" but we haven't learned.<br /><br />Taleb also warns us of the narrative fallacy based on our love of stories.  We feel we understand something when we can tell a story about why it happened--even after the fact, with only part of the relevant information.  When musicians achieve fame and dramatic financial success, we backtrack through their histories, explaining success by what we see along the path.  We don't see the hidden cemetery of failed garage bands and starving artists who did all the same things to no avail.  Because we believe this artificial story, we don't have to face the role of randomness in success or failure.  Or consider its impact on our own plans.<br /><br />Taleb offers some suggestions--though fewer than I'd hoped for.  He advises us to be open to positive black swans and guard against negative ones.  Lending money at interest, for example, opens us only to a high impact negative.  This worst case is that the borrower will go bankrupt and we won't get our money back.  But the very best outcome is that the loan will be simply repaid.  If the borrower's entrepreneurial effort is wildly, off-the-scale successful, the lender doesn't get any more than this.  An investor, on the other hand, suffers the same risk of loss, but participates fully in an \\"Extemistan\\" success.  Readers are left to ponder the implications--and perhaps to hire Taleb as an investment consultant.<br /><br />Although Taleb does not venture there, some of his ideas are useful in applied psychology.  Personnel tests, for example, rely on the principle of \\"behavioral consistency,\\" assuming that our past actions best predict our future actions.  If someone is a poor performer, the safe bet is that this person will perform poorly in future employment.  This may be fit a general model, but employers--and psychologists who advise them--might consider whether we commit Taleb's fallacies.  Are we so comfortable with are general predictive models, with our stories about how people \\"are,\\" that we close ourselves to possible change?  Wouldn't it be better to seek the occasional \\"gray swan\\" of improvement and hire the flawed job applicant?  The author has convinced me that this is worth considering.  My time reading this book was well spent.<br /><br />One final note:  The author's condescending tone has been mentioned by other reviewers.  It's there all right.  Yes, he is condescending.  Yes, he sneers at his fellow financial analysts.  Yes, his citations veer into name dropping.  And, yes, he finds ways to not-so-subtly complement himself as he praises Benoit Mandelbrot.  But none of this matters.  Taleb's message is valuable.  I recommend you ignore his tone--or perhaps even be entertained by it. Stay on task and learn something about the nature of randomness and prediction.ight consider whether we commit Taleb's fallacies.

B001LXIDVS|4.0|Although I don't love it as much as the first two, it's still pretty good! It takes place right after the second ended. Marty is stuck back in 1955 and needs Doc's help to get back to his time. They find the DeLorean in an old mine shaft and fix it up. Marty then finds Doc's tombstone that says that he died in 1885! So, Marty takes the DeLorean goes goes back further in time to save Doc from being shot by Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Doc saves Clara Clayton and they slowly begin to fall in love. Doc and Marty get the DeLorean ready to be pushed by a train to go back to the future, but Doc wants to stay because he loves Clara. Will Marty make it back to 1985? Will Doc stay with Clara? Will Doc be shot by Buford Tannen? If you want the answers, I highly recommend BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III!!!

B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wether you buy one disc, or three, with WALL-E you get the point. This is a movie with a great experience behind it.In this case I bought the Three disc set because it seemed like a very cool collection, and the Digital copy would go well on my Ipod. Well, I definitely got great Value.  WALL-E as a story travels over time, through space, across the stars, and right into your heart.Apart from the Marvelous story that I am sure you must know the gist of by reading the summaries here, the Disc one Features has the fun of Burn-E. The Laughter of Presto. The Fabulous deleted scenes that are so fun you ask why they were deleted but never mind, its on the DVDs. Wall-Es tour of the Universe is a definite ride and a half. The Sound scape secrets are more than you could imagine. And to top it all off, there is a Commentary , wow, so much.  But Wait, Says Billy, theres More:    Disc 2 has so much that its hard to fit it into one day. The Documentary about Pixar that shows the heart and soul behind WALL-E and surprise, at least for me, there is Steve  Jobs. Wall-Es Treasures and trinkets is possibly the best selection of bits edited together since a Monty Python Sletch. The Collection of the Bots, kind of a compendium of who is who on the ship is just hilarious. And the Making of Featurettes just go on and on.  Disc 3 has the Digital copy and its great.  So much fun for such a Great price. This is a gem, and I have hardly scratched the surface of the DVD set.( So to speak ).  ENJOY !!
1594200823|5.0|The book presents much new information that make the readers rethink the way they shop, eat and deal with food. The author presents his arguments in a neutral way as an average American who want to enjoy and benefit from the food he eats. Additionally, the author doesnt dictate wisedom as he leaves siginificant size of the discussion for the readers reflections and opinions.    The writing style is awesome as it merges the arts of scientific research, investigative journalism and novel writing. Such compinations make the reading enjoyable, benefecial and focused.
B001C08RHA|1.0|\\"Iron-Head\\" only has great special-effects. The film has a weak script; for example; Robert Downey Jr. leaves secret robot plans and later, parts out in the open for the pursuing enemy to find. His assistant Gwyneth Paltrow threatens to quit when he readies violence to stop the bad guys who are killing innocent people.     I would still have given 3-stars for the great special-effects, except the film tells teenagers and children, who we know are watching, to have sex with strangers. Robert Downey Jr. has sex with a woman he has just met that afternoon, whom he does not know; on top of one another, in bed, in the middle of the night; with Robert Downey Jr. in the process of undressing. This film was accompanied by children's comic-books, little-kid-size Halloween-costumes, and Iron-Head action-figures; showing younger children are targeted. What boy would not be thrilled to see a flying robot-suit. I am sure we will see Robert Downey Jr. promoting sexual-immorality in Iron-Head-2. Nowhere do we see Robert Downey Jr. show a change of heart. He fights the bad guys only because they attack him first. Real heroes do not make comic-book-hero films for kids that glorify having sex outside of marriage and with people you do not know.

0385495323|5.0|I've been developing an interest in physics as well as cryptography.  I was turned on to Singh's The Code Book simply because it mentioned quantum physics in the title, a happy intersection between my two new hobby subjects.  Soon after cracking it open, I realized that I'd picked up one of my favorite books in the past few years.<br /><br />Singh does a great job of laying out the history of cryptography (code writing) and cryptanalysis (code breaking, essentially) as well as explaining the logic behind each of the codes he discusses.  It's a fascinating history that builds and builds upon itself, making it clear to the reader how the cryptography readily available to him/her now was born.  All the while, Singh's explanation of the thought behind the codes is clear enough for a non-math major to quickly grasp (i.e. myself).<br /><br />I admit that the subject matter was right up my alley and this might not be the case for everyone, but I feel Singh's ability to weave a narrative into a convoluted subject (as it would be) is excellent and warrants a pick up.  The history is sturdy enough to support just about any reader and the analysis of the logic is clear and simple to latch on to, even as it delves into some deeper details.<br /><br />In all, this was a great read and I'd highly recommend picking it up.

B000UR9T82|5.0|The Spider-Man trilogy has enthralled audiences and made comic book fanboys like myself so happy to see our beloved webslinger on the big screen. Here, we have the (so far) definitive Blu Ray release of the trilogy. We have Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man 3. All in all, it's a 4 disc set. Now, since it's in high definition, we can expect perfect picture and sound right? In this case, oh yes. The Spider-Man trilogy is a perfect showcase of the richness and power of high definition video and the capabilities of the Blu Ray format. It's sad to say that there are only a handful of Blu Ray releases that actually look great and this set is no exception.<br /><br />First off, the video presentation is superb. I watched the films on my Sony BD-S350 Blu Ray player in 1080p (HDMI) on my new Toshiba Regza 42\\" television with a Bose 5.1 surround sound system, just for reference. Spidey 1 is presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio with part 2 and 3 in 2.40:1 ratio. The films are filled with special effects and the 1080p transfer delivers the goods. Definition and depth be clearly seen in the actor's faces and even their clothes. You can really see the depth of the fibers in Mary Jane's green sweater at the laboratory field trip, it's that good. Flesh tones and black levels are fantastic and the films feel alive. If you thought the DVDs looked good, you'll see them as obsolete upon viewing the Blu Ray versions. DVDs do not do any justice to the films. The scenes of Spidey swinging through New York just look amazing and Venom in part 3 just looks fantastic. All in all, this is a MUST BUY for Spidey fans and just to show off your fancy Blu Ray player.<br /><br />The audio is presented in PCM tracks and actually sounds better if not as good as TrueHD audio encode. The 5.1 mix is superb and allows great clarity of the voices, action, and music.

Even if you don't like part 3 ( I actually liked it for the action and effects), it's still enjoyable and you'll want to watch it when it looks this good. This is definitely a perfect way to show off Blu Ray, other than a nice CG animated movie or another special effects-ladened movie. Movie and comic fans alike will enjoy this box set and plus, it's the only way to get part 1 and 2 on Blu Ray.

1416594884|5.0|I still await the book of le Carre that displays his dotage and slip-of- his-art. \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" is not that book.    le Carre still weaves the most intricate webs of intrigue, realistic character development, and poetic prose of any writer I know. His latest work is a testament to his continued proof of adaptability to the present world which can still be based on and alluded to the Cold War era.     If any criticism of this book, it is the political undertones, so deftly inserted into the story that the reader might not recognize them. le Carre is accomplished in this technique, also, and his eloquence always supersedes his political innuendo.    Anone who has experienced the joy of reading John le Carre through the years will rejoice in this book.  The old spy-master still has it.    Bill Pollock

B000MQ54OY|4.0|This was a great family movie that we all enjoyed. It was fun, yet sentimental as well. Happy Feet is a great movie for the family to watch.
0316017922|5.0|Highly recommended. Another great book by Malcolm Gladwell. Every chapter makes you take a step back and ponder the implications for society as a whole. The book weaves elegantly from hockey to Bill Gates; rice farming in Asia to the KIPP school in The Bronx; the plantations of Jamaica to the halls of the great M&A law firms in New York. Reading this book, like Blink and The Tipping Point, will definitely change your perspective and broaden your thinking.
1932100660|5.0|This is truly a monumental book which upsets all the normal diet and nutrition concepts. This is a not-to-be-missed book for everyone interested in improving their health through nutrition. The scientific evidence of this incredible study is irrefutable. The information in this book will compel you to make changes in your life away from the rich, western diet to a more sensible approach to nutrition that is plant-based. While the concept is challenging for many to adopt, it is truly the inconvenient truth that will save your life.
B0000256KE|5.0|This is Roxy Music's best album, but \\"If There is Something\\" from the first album is their best song.  But let's clear something up now.  I have never understood the appeal of \\"Do the Strand\\".  After listening to Roxy Music for 30 years I can now bartely tolerate \\"Do the Strand\\" and \\"Virginia Plain\\" but they are really gimmick songs with no soul to them.  Other than \\"Do the Strand\\", the only other bad song on this album is \\"The Bogus Man\\".  It is unbearable.  The live version on \\"Viva\\" is much better if you must listen to \\"The Bogus Man\\".  At the same time, the live version of \\"If There is Something\\" on \\"Viva\\" is outstanding - the best non-bootleg Roxy recording and the best rock and roll song of all time.  The only thing better is the poorly recorded 12 minute version off the BBC tapes.  But back to \\"For Your Pleasure\\".  The title song is about how you go to hell for the pleasure you experience in life.  I have never heard anyone else figure this out, but listen to the end of the song as the flames rise to consume the man amid the stange shouts - and then comes the strange questioning \\"don't ask why\\".  Don't as what, don't ask why you go to hell for your pleasure.  You will find a lot of religous references throughout Roxy's work.  The best song on this album might be the very under rated \\"Grey Lagoons\\" - great song.  Love \\"Strictly Confidential\\" too.  If you are a mindless dolt who can not understand the concept of a \\"life of the mind\\" you will not like the first two Roxy albums.  Most American's are seemingly dim wits who are throughly brainwashed by the mass media.  They don't understand the past and can't face the future (which is pretty bleak thanks to the liberalism that has ruined the US since FDR turned the country over to his puppet masters).  Anyway, it's not that [genetic] American's are stupid, they have just turned off the philosophical thought process in their brain and therefore will not survive the rough and tumble future.  But while we wait for ourdemise, those of us that can still think might as well listen to Roxy Music.  One last point, I recently gave an old copy of \\"Roxy Music\\" (with a skipping \\"Bitter's End) to fellow at work who facies himself to be quite an intellectual.  I told him that \\"If There is Something\\" is the greatest rock and roll song of all time.  I haven't heard a word from him on the subject.  If you can't appreciate that song, can you think at all?  But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" is the greatest song of all time.  After all, they didn't have Roxy Music performing at the Super Bowl.  I think Roxy Music performing their early stuff would have stunned the audience into silence.
0307394549|3.0|This is a great collection of cookie recipes and is organized well with pretty pictures for many of the cookies.  My complaint is the binding.  The first copy I received fell apart the first time I looked at it.  Amazon replaced it at no cost to me.  I am much more careful with this copy but I don't think it will hold to the test of time.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  I own other papper backs that are thicker and they are fine.  Anyway, I think this book would be better if it were hardcovered or spiral bound.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I had seen the movie and bought it because I loved it so much in the theatre.  It is wonderful even the second and third time I watched it.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I was very pleased with the dvd set and how quickly it was processed : )
B00021R7CG|2.0|The topic is interesting and could well have been explored more in movies, but: The acting is really bad. Are the actors instructed in a way to make them under-perform? The psychology is absolutely not-believable. The stage sets smell \\"cheap\\" long way. And the technical details sound just wrong, or are obviously wrong and under-researched. - I felt I was watching a movie from the seventies.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|I thought this film was fantastic - aesthetically, in script, in casting, and in storyline. Yes, the film is a bit slow and winding, and No, it does not give into a fantasy-happy American ending. That's the best part. Penelope Cruz was beautiful and quite funny at times. If nothing more, this film made me open my eyes to the ways of love and lust, as well as made me want to visit Espana as soon as possible.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was one of this lost souls who used to say \\"what is the big fuss with this Firefly series?\\" When I started watching the series I was entertained but just that, but after I had watched all the episodes I felt like a dear friend had left me. Not many things do that to a human soul. This is a very special kind of show. If you havent seen the series you are missing out big time.

B00116GHMM|5.0|I recently received a turntable as a gift, so I was excited to buy a new vinyl record for my collection.    The vinyl record itself is heavy, it's not labeled as 180 gram vinyl, but it's heavier than the other records in my collection.  Heavier vinyl is more durable, and some people claim that it sounds better.    The vinyl mix is supposedly \\"enhanced\\", and in general it sounds amazing, sounds much better than a tinny, pirated MP3 from a torrent (shh!).  On certain songs, like \\"Kids\\" (last song on Side 1), the bass is pounding away, and it sounds a little distorted, and the vocals are fuzzy-sounding.    The inner sleeve has glossy artwork (lots of concentric circles on one side, and lyrics printed on the other side). (\\"Glossy\\" compared to the typical paper-y inner sleeve).    Buyer beware, a sticker on the outside says \\"Includes code for free MP3 download of this album\\".  Yes, there is a code with the album, but the offer for the free download ended on 1/23/09 (it's February 10th, during the writing of this review).  The expiration date should be on the outside of the album, to avoid getting people's hopes up. Or better yet, there shouldn't be an expiration date at all.    In my opinion, Oracular Spectacular is one of the best albums of 2008, the melodies are catchy, beats are great, it's just awesome synth-pop. I'm reluctant on calling it \\"indie\\" cause this is MGMT's release on Columbia, but it has indie aesthetics. I'd give 5 stars for the album, but 4 stars for the vinyl version of the album.  It would be a great addition to any vinyl record collection!
B0000009SI|5.0|I was a high school freshman in '76 at a private boarding school when I first heard a monstrously bizarre sonic carnival. A sophomore dorm mate was playing a \\"Weasels Ripped My Flesh\\" record, and it drew me like an absurd intoxicating incense. Who is that? WHAT is that? I was amazed, awestruck, stunned, confused, frightened, and even giddy. I listened to the whole side, then the other, while I clutched the cover intently studying it for clues to the secret of its quixotic allure. When it ended my buddy informed me confidently that he possessed another one that he was sure would Really sizzle my cranium. \\"Apostrophe\\" surged into me like the purest melodic opiate. For you see, the disquieting mysteries that \\"Weasels\\" had so brazenly vexed me with were then soulfully, sweetly, snidely assuaged by \\"Apostrophe.\\" I was hearing answers to questions I never, ever could have conceived of till then. Oh sure, we had been regularly tickling and pickling our minds with various molecular additives, as was the custom of the day, but here was sumthin' else. \\"Apostrophe\\" became my symphonic declaration of independence. In a matter of minutes I had been released from a life of musical bondage, and led to the promised land of infinite possibility. It was a sublime, cosmic, epic birth into a glorious realm of riotously joyous opportunity. Yeah, exactly like that...
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is ala a guilty pleasure of mine that I do not mind owning up to. I have a Dexter marathon going on each night at my house right now. I have showtime and caught the show in the middle of season 3 and I absolutely loved it. So now I have ordered season 1& 2 to get caught up on Dexter's predelections.    It is a very clever show. Michael C. Hall is both sinister and sexy all at the same time and we can justify Dex a little because he only kills the bad guys and he never kills on asumption he has to have downright proof that the bad guy has committed a crime that has led to an innocent person or persons death. And his line of work makes retrieving proof very easy.    I like watching this complex, empty shell of a guy fit in like a chamelian to satisfy his carnal urges. This is definately must see TV!

0307454894|5.0|The Reader is one of the most haunting books I have read in quite a long time. As someone who reads 2-4 books a month, this book stopped me in my tracks. The questions raised by the author are difficult, if not impossible to answer; therefore, making them stay with you, turning them over and over in your mind. The question of \\"collective guilt\\" is very interesting. Additionally, the main character, Hanna Schmitz, is complex in her simplicity. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who is a serious reader.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Just got done watching this, and thought it was great. A very accurate representation of Marine life, with all the good and bad things that go on. Highly recommended (along with 'Carrier').

B000002KGU|5.0|Rumours is forty minutes and thirty seconds long and was released on February 4, 1977. Rumours reached #1 in three different categories and stay at #1 for over thirty weeks. Here are the categories and the length at them: U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart (31 Weeks), U.S. Record World (33 Weeks), and U.S. Cashbox (35 Weeks). Rumours has since gone 19x Platinum and won a Grammy Award in 1978 for Album of the Year-1978. Also Rumours charted four singles as well. By far this is Fleetwood Mac greatest work. The entire artist wrote songs for the album. During the making of this album, all five band members were going through divorces. So the song on the album represents the personal struggles each one is going through. This album deserves an AAA+++.

0060899220|1.0|By all accounts, this guy isn't much of a chef.  Despite his fervent desire to be \\"one of us\\", he ain't.  He's not much of a writer either.  His words are forced, his scenarios are false, and he relies on stereotypes to support his portrayal of being somebody he's not.  I couldn't care less that he's stupid enough to put herion into his veins.  He's just another loser who wants to justify his inability to excel by somehow \\"identifying\\" with the rest of the people who really do work hard to put out a decent meal.    Skip this nonsense.  Look toward successful chefs for insight, whose words are few and far between.  Bourdain is a fake.  He's just cashing in on the FoodTV craze while at the same time condemning it.  Fraud.

B000002J1O|5.0|Probably (with Lamb) the definitive pre-pop (pre-singing Phil) Genesis.  This album (yes, I am old enough to have bought the original on vinyl) is truly a masterpiece of progressive rock.  A \\"must-have\\" to complete any collection of progressive rock or, for that matter, any collection of 70's music.  For those who are not collectors, this album is an absolute listening pleasure.  Melody, pretty keyboard work, spectacular imagery, hard edged structural, well, music, combine to make this a cd you'll want to play over and over again.  You may even find places to sing along.
0375842209|4.0|This book was recommended to me as \\"a fantastic read\\", so I took it to Florida for my \\"vacation read\\".  After the first chapter, I thought about putting the book down to pick up one that I could get into faster.  I am so glad that I did not.  Once, I got use to Death talking, and use to the manner of writing, it was just as I heard, amazing.  It made me think, it made sense, and it introduced me to a new author.  This will not be the last book by Mr. Zusak that I read, in fact, I am now getting ready to read \\"I Am Messenger\\".  Give it a chance, and enjoy!!
B00164IV9G|5.0|I went with my best friend of 22 years.  It was like watching a movie of our lives in our single days.  We laughed out loud at all the stupid and embarrassing things the characters did and said in the movie - the very same things we said and did back in the day.  We sat by the phone waiting for it to ring, picked it up to make sure it was working, spent an eternity over drinks analyzing and picking apart everything the guy who never called said.  I think it was spot on.  I would not, however, recommend this as a dating movie - this is one for the girls' night out.  Enjoy, ladies!
141690977X|1.0|He's Just Not That Into You is over two hours of people talking. There's no action and no musical montages. Just 130 minutes of voices whining about love, relationships, and the lack thereof.Sadly, every conversation, every attempt at interpersonal insight, is buffered by the inherent unbelievability of the emotions being offered. This is a film where thirtysomethings act like adolescents, where man/woman interaction is illustrated in seventh grade compatibility test responses. Sure, a little dab of truth occasionally comes spitting out of these well-coiffed and decaffeinated mouths, but we have to wait so long for the genuineness that the fiction becomes all the more obvious.    This is a story where we barely care for anyone. In fact, one character in particular -- the flighty ditz, main character -- grates on our nerves like polished nails on a cinematic chalkboard. Goodwin's Gigi has a stalker-like sensibility, matched with an inhuman level of naiveté, that causes her every action to resonate like tinfoil on one's fillings. She even makes the morose, self-absorbed angst of Connelly's Janine and Aniston's Beth, seem semi-tolerable. We don't really see the storylines progress so much as merely turn the page to the next episode of idiocy.    In fact, it's the underlying sentiment that ultimately derails \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\". Every single female character is portrayed as stupid, illogical, borderline psychotic, and desperate for a man to complete her sense of self. Unless you've spent your entire adult life in isolation, or literally think that men are from Mars, this movie will blindside your intelligence. People, especially those of the female persuasion, are definitely smarter than the way they are portrayed here. Any adult will find this movie insulting.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is going to be a short review, since what can I say that hasn't been said in the 2700 other positive reviews. After watching Serenity, I had to see what Firefly was like. Wow, what an addicting show. This show just has something that many shows will never have, but I can't quite put my finger on it. I guess I would have to say heart. I can't believe a show like this gets only 14 episodes while other series don't end soon enough. Now I have to watch a mere 14 episodes over and over again. Everything about this boxed set is awesome just because of the show itself. I can't believe I haven't seen this show sooner. I finally know what all the commotion was about with this show being killed long before it should have. Fox I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul!
0316017922|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book, as I had heard much about the author and was expecting a lot.    The book reads like a collection of interesting anecdotes rather than the structured and well-reasoned argument I believe Gladwell was attempting. Although these anecdotes do start to build a context for a hypothesis to develop from, it never develops properly during the course of the book - this is particularly noticable at the end where the author completely fails to tie up any kind of conclusions and instead leaves us with yet another anecdote.    The book also makes a heavy use of statistics to make it's point. It actually reads like Freakonomic Part 2 - a collection of interesting stories and statistics loosely based on the theme of success. I say 'loosely' because the author loses his way with theme as well - a large section of the book is about the causes of airline accidents. This has little to do with success, except to make the point that if where you come seems affects your chances of crashing an aeroplane (which he argues it does), then it could also affect your changes of being successful.    Overall a great disappointment, and unfortunately reading it was one of those rare occassions whereby the investment made in buying and reading the book was much more than what I got out of it.
055358894X|5.0|Most fantasy isn't very good, and a very small portion of what is worth reading isn't worth purchasing, but Scott Lynch has really created a fantastic book in The Lies of Locke Lamora. A humorous tale of a band of rogues and the well-described city they inhabit, this novel starts off as self-satisfied as its hero and is easy to write off. Given time, however, it becomes apparent that Lynch isn't arrogant; he's merely confident, and the story gets better as it goes, all the way through the rousing climax. The characters in this book leap out of the page, and the recommendation from master author George R. R. Martin is well-placed. If you're tired of sorcerors and knights and kings and their kingdoms, give Locke Lamora a chance. It's like Perdido Street Station but without the deadly seriousness.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I had gotten another mobile as a gift and the toys fell off and hit my son in his face. I returned and bought this one instead! The music is really nice.

B001AKTZPK|5.0|Another great album from one of the best rock bands ever. The album features the two classic hits \\"Down On The Corner\\" and \\"Fortunate Son\\". The album has quite a country feel on many of the tracks, and contains a bluesy classic called \\"Feelin' Blue\\", which in my opinion is a track that doesn't get the attention that it should.   Once again the extra tracks are not real interesting, but who cares?
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I figured since everyone else has given a review about the DVD itself, I am just going to praise this movie. Because of this movie I found Firefly. Yeah, I know it's a little backwards, but it worked for me. If we can't have any more Firefly at least they gave us a movie. If you liked Firefly, you'll like this movie. Of course, in two hours they can't cover everything, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to accept. I watched this once and then saw the 14 episodes of Firefly and I have to say I am hooked. This movie is worth watching repeatedly. Don't just listen me, read the other 1300 reviews that really liked this movie. This movie was worth every penny. Buy, Buy, Buy.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|Being a Playstation fan since PS1, I had been accustomed to the old \\"button\\" style triggers from PS1 and PS2. I never really liked the trigger on the PS3 controller, but got used to hitting them with my middle fingers. I tried these out and they DO help prevent slipping quite a bit. However, the extra height of these triggers now prevents me from hitting them with my middle fingers; instead, I have to use my index fingers. I think after a bit more use I should be able to adjust to them.     As others have said, the build quality is superb and they snap on and stay on very well. Due to the low price, I highly recommend any PS3 fan to give this a try!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This is an excellent album.  His voice (as well as the album in general) is very raw and very powerful.  The lyrics of many of the songs are excellent as well.  You can't listen to this album and not feel the emotion he conveys through the music.  There is nothing out of the ordinary here, no crazy electronic generated sounds, just a guy on his guitar with some great background sax and trumpet in some songs.  I love acoustic music and this album is one of my favourites.  The melodies are pretty simple but unforgettable.  Just an all around great indy album; I highly recommend it.
0307346617|5.0|In a follow up to the Zombie Survival Guide, World War Z explores my favorite part of the original Survival Guide which was the \\"real\\" historical accounts of zombie encounters.    World War Z explores the various stages of the Zombie Apocalypse written in the aftermath of a total, all out, global war against the undead. Across various countries the undead scourage nearly destroyed humanity and WWZ explores how it happened, what we did about it, how we prevailed, and the future rebuilding of America and the world.     Something you need to understand going into this. It is a work of FICTION. Yes that much should be obvious but many coorelations have been drawn between this book and real life political climates. Don't be swayed or fooled into thinking that this book is a thinly veiled political manifesto. Even if it was intended as such it certainly doesn't read that way. It's entertaining, \\"real,\\" and well-written.    The book is divided into sections dealing with the initial stages of the outbreak when very few people realized what was happening, the buildup where slowly the truth was becoming evident, the \\"Great Panic\\" and ensuing all out war, and the aftermath and rebuilding of the world. It tells the tale from the perspectives of a diverse array of people of all sizes, shapes, and colors from the streets of America to the mountains of India, and the oceans of the Pacific. There are parts of the book that seem outlandish and extreme just as there are parts that seem frighteningly realistic.     One of my favorite accounts is by a Japanese submarine officer and how he and the rest of his crew survived at sea after deserting the Navy to save their family and loved ones. The story is gripping, chilling, and very personal.     One of the better storys also concerns the US Army's \\"last stand\\" at Yonkers, NY and how the Army was vastly unprepared for a war against the dead when all of their strategies and tactics were developed for use against the living.     There's alot of information, a lot of fun, and a lot of research contained in this book and I highly reccomend it to anyone who read and enjoyed the Zombie Survival Guide as well as Zombie fans all over.
B00007LTIB|5.0|El que escuche por 1era ves este disco se dara cuenta que se trata de un albun distinto a los anteriores a pesar que tiene un formato similar al Close to the Edge. Este debe ser una de las canciones que sencillamente me encantan y en esta se conjugan los coros de Anderson, los bajos escalofriantes de Squire, una percusion fenomenal (que por raos hace olvidar que no esta Bruford), los sintetizadores de Moraz y los destellos de Howe, llenos de imaginacion, creatividad enso&ntilde;acion y lo que se te ocurra. Tanto es asi que no creo q nadie puede dejar de escuchar esta cancion sin sentirse abrumado por tanta belleza y a la ves potencia arrasadora, (algo q es muy propio del rock progresivo de los 70) y que en algun momento se sintetizo como el tirunfo de la vida sobre la muerte.<br /><br />Anderson con su voz fuerte y a la ves aguda nos demuestra tanto en estudio como en vivo que es la voz inalcansable de este estilo de musica, alcanzando en conjunto un caracter epico nunca antes tan desarrollado por Yes. Los coros son muy dramaticos, visto sobre todo en pasajes en los que se quedan solos. La guitarra de Howe y los teclados de Moraz refuerzan los pasajes solistas cuando no esta Anderson, casi a modo de concerto grosso.<br /><br />Apartir del minuto 8, la cancion alcanza dimensiones epicas inabarcables, con un ritmo dinamico se superponen la guitarra y los teclados casi en una batalla campal en donde el bajo y la bateria tan poco se quedan atras, llegando nuevamente a sentir que es un duelo de titanes y a la vez muy armonico. A partir del minuto 10, el ritmo cambia, aunque no el tiempo, dandole un caracter aun mas grave en donde los efectos de todos los instrumentos se mezclan con el rapido ritmo de bateria acabando en un caos de sonidos, muy parecido a una conflagracion musical.<br /><br />A partir del minuto 12, la tension instrumental, alcanza una especie de pseudo-muerte lenta enunciada con el teclado y asi se logra bajar el nivel del pasaje anterior para llegar a un medio tiempo en donde el \\"feeling\\" se deja ver en los instrumentos solistas, sobre todo en la guitarra que es la que mas sobresale.<br /><br />En el minuto 15 donde, y luego de todo ese \\"Caos\\", se entra en unos acordes de sintetizador que daran paso a una secuencia de acordes de Howe que luego repetira Anderson en donde despues de la tempestad vuelve la calma. Un rayo de optimismo esperanzador parece asomar en los ultimos 8 minutos que son sencillamente indescriptibles, con tada la sensibilidad de Howe y su guitarra, llevando la batuta en momentos de una manera admirable.<br /><br />Jon Anderson dijo \\"Se trata de una cancion sobre la guerra, la escena de una batalla. Pero nuestra intencion no era denunciar la guerra, ni tratar de explicarla, sino que se trataba de una descripcion emocional; que termina con una expresion de resignacion, con un dejo, como diciendo: 'Siempre tendremos que pasar por todo esto?'. Yo compuse la melodia pensando en la guerra y se la toque al resto del grupo en un piano. Por eso mientras hacia: 'tanan - tanan - tanantanan - tanantanannnn', todos me miraban como si estuviera loco...\\" La musica, en si, describe una humanidad al borde del caos, pero finaliza con la calma, con el triunfo de la vida sobre la muerte, con Jon cantando la bella \\"Soon\\" (editada como simple).\\"feeling\\" se deja ver en los instrumentos solistas, sobre todo en la guitarra que es la que mas sobresale.

B000O59AFC|4.0|Finally the version we have been waiting for. All the DVD versions were really poor transfers. There is much to be said about the screwy screen version of super TV series.<br /> However my focus is mainly on the quality of the Blu Ray transfer which is quite good. The picture is crisp and sound is excellent . Some cool special features, wish they had the music video for the film. Overall a good buy if you want to see how Blu Ray works on old movies.
B00000FC5H|4.0|CD is terrific. It's not just Earth, Wind and Fire, but like I captioned above, it is so hot, it's raging hot. GREAT!

B001P5HI4A|5.0|The YENTL (DIRECTOR'S EXTENDED EDITION) 2-DVD SET is what a DVD set should be.<br /><br />A dream production that Barbra Streisand carried around for years, based in part on a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer [[ASIN:0374293473 Yentl the Yeshiva Boy]], which she dedicated to her father. When the movie came out in 1983, Streisand became one of the few celebs (if not the first) to star, direct, produce and sing in one film.<br /><br />The story is about a woman who disguises herself as a boy to study the Talmud and takes place during the turn of the last century in Europe, where women were forbidden to learn or read scholarly books. Yentl changes her name to Anschel, cuts her hair and dresses like a man, and then gets tangled up in a three-way love affair that really challenges the notion of what is love and gender.<br /><br />At its heart--both in the film and in reality--YENTL is really about hope and awakenings and the pursuit of a dream, not to mention the challenging of rules and ideals that are unjust. Amy Irving and Mandy Patinkin deliver stellar performances. And of course, all would not be right without Barbra Streisand's creative vision and direction.<br /><br />=============== DVD 1 ================<br />** INTRO ** Barbra introduces the movie and the inclusion of additional footage added to the extended version and explains why the scenes were cut.<br /><br />** MOVIE ** Option to play either the extended director's cut (which includes added deleted scenes) and the theatrical version.<br /><br />** ADDITIONAL DELETED SCENES ** Those not included in the extended cut<br /><br />=============== DVD 2 ================<br /><br />** INTRO ** (3:00-minutes) Barbra explains the process of directing etc.<br /><br />** DIRECTOR'S REEL ** (6:50-minutes) This shows unedited footage of the actors during a scene as the director pushes to get the right emotional response.<br /><br />** AMATEUR VIDEO OF REHEARSALS FOR MUSICAL NUMBERS **<br />This is very interesting to watch as it shows the amount of preparation Streisand did before going into the actual production of the movie.

B00007KWHN|5.0|Tomo un respiro muuuuuy profundo, me recuesto pensativo y voy girando sobre m&iacute; mismo, tonteando, meditando, retrasando lo m&aacute;s que se pueda el momento. Qu&eacute; momento. Revisar a Yes. Quiz&aacute; les suene exagerado a algunos, pero considero que esto es lo m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil que me tocar&aacute; escribir en la p&aacute;gina; este es el momento que quer&iacute;a que nunca llegase, que postergu&eacute; durante tanto tiempo. Pero ten&iacute;a que llegar. Maldici&oacute;n.<br /><br />&iquest;Por qu&eacute; tanto capricho y tanta alharaca? Ver&aacute;n, Yes es una banda que ME LIMA LA CABEZA, y no lo digo ni en el buen sentido ni en el malo. Lo digo en un sentido neutro. Siento que es m&aacute;s de lo que puedo absorber, siento que, no importa todo lo que escuche, no puedo formarme una opini&oacute;n definitiva. A veces escucho a Yes y pienso: \\"qu&eacute; tipos geniales, que visi&oacute;n, que originalidad, que locura\\", y otras veces pienso: \\"que tremendos in&uacute;tiles buenos para nada\\". A veces creo que estoy ante la mism&iacute;sima cumbre del rock progresivo, otras veces tengo ganas de agarrar todos sus discos, pisotearlos y echarlos a la hoguera. Soy, para decirlo de alguna manera, la arena donde deliberan en peque&ntilde;a escala el amor y el odio apasionado que el p&uacute;blico general expresa con respecto a esta banda. Porque es as&iacute;: a Yes se lo ama con locura o se lo odia con sim&eacute;trica pasi&oacute;n. Como que no hay t&eacute;rmino medio. Ni siquiera yo soy el t&eacute;rmino medio; por momentos los amo con locura, y por momentos simplemente no puedo soportarlos. Esta maldita banda me vuelve ESQUIZOFR&Eacute;NICO.<br /><br />La sensaci&oacute;n que hasta ahora he exprimentado con Yes es la de una tremenda FRUSTRACI&Oacute;N. Es como si de pronto me mojaran la oreja con peque&ntilde;os mordiscos de sublime calidad; ah&iacute; me restriego las manos y pienso \\"Waw! esto va a estar bueno\\", pero despu&eacute;s los tipos disparan para cualquier lado inesperado, dej&aacute;ndome exhausto, desorientado, con la sensaci&oacute;n de que no he recibido todo lo que mi organismo necesita y que en su lugar me han vendido una sarta de delirios incre&iacute;blemente rebuscados sin punto de partida ni de llegada. La m&uacute;sica de Yes es enfermiza, ca&oacute;tica, desordenada. No s&eacute;, simplemente no s&eacute;. Nunca jam&aacute;s le dir&iacute;a a nadie que Yes est&aacute; entre mis grupos favoritos, pero despu&eacute;s vuelvo a sus discos y recuerdo que Fragile es excelente, que Close To The Edge es una obra &uacute;nica y exuberante, que The Yes Album es completamente maravilloso. Y entonces &iquest;COMO ES POSIBLE? &iquest;C&oacute;mo es posible que los &aacute;lbumes me fascinen tanto pero siempre tenga un dejo de rencor en la boca al hablar de esta banda? No tengo una respuesta demasiado coherente. Y es por esto es que tanta FIACA me daba ponerme a trabajar en estas rese&ntilde;as. &iquest;C&oacute;mo les explico a mis queridos lectores las sensaciones encontradas, ambiguas, que me provocan Jon Anderson y su pandilla de enfermos pretenciosos incurables?<br /><br />Tratar&eacute; de hacerlo lo mejor que se pueda, pero no esperen demasiado orden. Estas revisiones ser&aacute;n an&aacute;logas a la m&uacute;sica de Yes; ser&aacute;n un pasticho de reflexiones que se dispersan para cualquier parte y nunca encuentran un lugar d&oacute;nde encajar. Es mi forma de vengarme (JA!). Bien, basta solamente un somero repaso informativo para concluir que, t&eacute;cnicamente hablando, Yes es la banda m&aacute;s impresionante que jam&aacute;s haya pisado los p&aacute;ramos del Planeta Tierra. &iquest;Chris Squire? Un bajista de la reput&iacute;sima madre que pod&iacute;a hacer virtualmente TODO con cuatro cuerditas de mierda; &iquest;Steve Howe? un guitarrista virtuoso, cl&aacute;sico, compositor sublime de intrincadas melod&iacute;as ac&uacute;sticas que un guitarrista com&uacute;n no podr&iacute;a ni SO&Ntilde;AR con tocar; &iquest;Rick Wakeman? Un pianista fuera de serie, un lun&aacute;tico que pon&iacute;a la mano sobre el teclado y ya sonaban cascadas de inimaginadas sensaciones; &iquest;Bill Bruford? Un grosso, el Beethoven de la bater&iacute;a, un tipo que tira cualquier cantidad de estructuras, improvisaciones, toqueteos sin perder el ritmo una puta vez. &iquest;Jon Anderson? Ahhh, no me gusta realmente mucho, pero el flaco no tocaba nada, as&iacute; que no cuenta. Y solamente estoy hablando de la formaci&oacute;n cl&aacute;sica. &iexcl;Estamos ante un maldito DREAM TEAM de la m&uacute;sica! Mi lista de m&uacute;sicos preferidos incluye A TODOS ELLOS. &iexcl;&iexcl;Y Yes no est&aacute; entre mis bandas favoritas!!<br /><br />Pero bueno, ah&iacute; est&aacute; el problema. Es un DREAM TEAM. Es casi un supergrupo, un conglomerado de grandes estrellas concientes de esa condici&oacute;n, y lo que hacen permanentemente destella virtuosismo por tonelada, pero pocas, muy pocas veces terminan de armar una unidad musical verdaderamente arm&oacute;nica, convincente de principio a fin. La m&uacute;sica de Yes suena como una violenta y permanente batalla entre los instrumentistas, cada uno tratando simult&aacute;neamente de demostrar que es el mejor, que puede cortarse solo, que puede hacer las cosas BIEN complicadas si se lo propone. Est&aacute; bien, ese es el estilo y ciertamente los flacos suenan como ninguna otra banda lo ha hecho jam&aacute;s, pero lo cierto es que en raras ocasiones esa tremenda complejidad que son capaces de lograr se traduce en valor de entretenimiento o placer genuino. Muchas veces se acercan, pero casi NUNCA logran poner mi persona en el &eacute;xtasis abosoluto que logran otros grupos de rock progresivo como Genesis o King Crimson.<br /><br />Es el concepto de lo que yo siempre llamo \\"virtuosismo vac&iacute;o\\", esa m&uacute;sica que me provoca decir: \\"Bien, b&aacute;rbaro, sos un capo tocando, &iquest;Pero pod&eacute;s hacer que adem&aacute;s de complicado suene INTERESANTE?\\". En realidad, hay muchos pasajes musicales de Yes que son interesantes en serio (no son Steve Vai, por suerte), pero tambi&eacute;n hay muchos, demasiados, en los cuales parece que lo &uacute;nico que quieren es irse al carajo con la complejidad y si sale algo interesante de escuchar o no, es solo cuesti&oacute;n de suerte. Muchas veces Yes termina sonando como una sucesi&oacute;n de garabatos virtuosos ESTUPIDOS que no van a ning&uacute;n lado; fuerzan la m&aacute;quina, se quieren hacer los capos y terminan sonando FEO y TORPE. A veces amenazan con tener una buena idea pero no terminan de desarrollarla y saltan de golpe con cualquier otra cosa inesperada que no suena del todo bien. Otras veces se extienden demasiado tiempo sobre ideas musicales que no valen nada y que solo irritan. Alguno dir&aacute;: \\"Claro, pero es avantgarde puro, experimentalismo m&aacute;ximo\\"... Y yo digo: puede ser, pero la cosa no termina de cerrar una sensaci&oacute;n de vanguardismo experimental muy convincente como pasa, por ejemplo, con el Pink Floyd temprano o The Velvet Underground. Simplemente parece m&uacute;sica que quiere cautivar pero que FALLA. Para m&iacute; el rock progresivo es un g&eacute;nero que ante todo estimula la imaginaci&oacute;n, estimula el arte, estimula el deseo art&iacute;stico que las personas tenemos dentro... Yes muchas veces se queda corto en este sentido; muchos de sus pasajes simplemente no me seducen, se me hacen est&eacute;riles, se me hacen vac&iacute;os y me dejan insatisfecho.<br /><br />Pero me detendr&eacute; porque ya estoy dando una imagen negativa de la banda cuando en realidad me gustan, cuando en realidad disfruto sus mejores discos como cualquier otro. Solo quer&iacute;a decir que con demasiada frecuencia sus virtuosismos me hacen sentir un vac&iacute;o que me duerme el cerebro, pero cuando Yes llega a ser bueno es MUUUUY bueno. Yes, si se lo propone, puede ser atmosf&eacute;rico, puede ser mel&oacute;dico,puede ser creativo, puede patear todos los culos que se les ocurra. Sus mejores discos est&aacute;n bien construidos, ah&iacute; la banda s&iacute; funciona como un reloj aceitado de partes que se complementan. La coda de Starship Trooper, la intro de Heart Of The Sunrise, el intermezzo de South Side Of The Sky. Eso s&iacute; que es impresionante, tanto como los mejores momentos de King Crimson o Genesis. Y adem&aacute;s los tipos son ORIGINALES. O sea, &iquest;D&oacute;nde m&aacute;s pod&eacute;s encontrar algo que suene as&iacute;? &iquest;As&iacute; como? NO MAN! No se puede describir. El estilo de estos tipos es algo que o se escucha realmente o ni se intuye. Las canciones de Yes tienen una din&aacute;mica impresionante; cambian permanentemente, no siguen ning&uacute;n patr&oacute;n fijo. Todo el tiempo te asaltan con algo nuevo. Mezclan estilos, rockean con &oacute;rganos pesados, densos y guitarras ac&uacute;sticas, sacan riffs el&eacute;ctricos totalmente heterodoxos que se hunden en una nube de voces arremolinadas, echan cortinas INFLADAS de sintetizadores en el medio, y sobre todo este pasticho est&aacute;n las letras de Jon Anderson que son UNA LOCURA PRETENCIOSA SIN SENTIDO ALGUNO. Estos tipos son RAROS. Son MUUUUY RAROS. Son excelentes cuando quieren. Son unos completos hincha-pelotas cuando quieren. A veces en un nivel lo que escuch&aacute;s parece absolutamente genial, en otro nivel como que le falta algo y en otro nivel te corroe los test&iacute;culos. Por eso, por eso es dif&iacute;cil abordarlos y dar un juicio definitivo. Si no te gustan los excesos grandilocuentes, no son para vos, desde ya te lo digo. Es prog rock, pero no se parecen ni a Genesis ni a King Crimson ni a nadie. Son Yes.<br /><br />Y como son Yes y nada m&aacute;s, el amor o el odio por esta banda pasa por una cuesti&oacute;n de estilo. De si te gusta o no te gusta el estilo. Personalmente me gusta, pero no llego a SENTIRLO al 100%. Me fascina a veces, me aburre a veces. Es as&iacute;, es una cuesti&oacute;n de piel. Puedo intentar desmenuzarlos, analizarlos parte por parte, pero eventualmente no le voy a poder negar JAMAS al fan de Yes que su m&uacute;sica no es EXCELENTE (cosa que s&iacute; le podr&iacute;a negar al fan de Metallica, por lo menos con mayor convicci&oacute;n) como no le voy a poder negar al es&eacute;ptico que Yes es una p&eacute;rdida de tiempo. El caso de Yes es tan aberrante, tan diferente, que es dif&iacute;cil medirlos con la misma vara que se mide a otros grupos. Algo as&iacute; como ocurre con Queen; es como que tienen su propio universo de las cosas, un universo que no tiene ning&uacute;n correlato en el resto del rock. Y as&iacute;, Tales From Topographic Oceans puede ser una obra maestra o un completo fracaso. No seduce como, por ejemplo, Wish You Were Here, &iquest;Pero acaso QUIERE seducir como Wish You Were Here? &iquest;O m&aacute;s bien quiere ser un manifiesto lun&aacute;tico totalmente rompecocos, an&aacute;rquico, de otro planeta? Es dif&iacute;cil. Revisar y sacar conclusiones sobre Yes es dif&iacute;cil. Dir&eacute; que mezclan de una manera inextrincable partes de virtuosismo muy vac&iacute;o, muy retorcido y muy feo, y partes de genio progresivo supremo que no pod&eacute;s juzgar ni comparar en base a nada que hayas escuchado antes. Amarlos, odiarlos, cada uno har&aacute; lo que le salga de adentro.inesperada que no suena del todo bien.

B000HEVZ6W|4.0|Once again after experimenting with the Blu Ray transfer I am really happy with the excellent quality. I am checking films which I own on dvd previously where the picture quality has somewhat downgraded over the years.<br />The picture is really superb as the blues and the yellows in this film are lovely to look at. Something I never understood on dvd was how poorly both colour tones tend to look on dvd or cable. The sound was a bit on the quiet side mostly becuase this is a drama/thriller and it was a bit hard to understand certain words.<br />A good buy and must have for Sci Fi fans.

0316143472|4.0|I've read some things by David Sedaris that have made me laugh so hard that if I didn't clench my legs together as tight as I could, I would have peed.  This is not one of those books.  Sedaris recounts several stories in this book that take place in his later adult life, no longer telling of his hilarious, if not disfunctional, youth.  It's not as if his life isn't funny as he's grown up, it's just not AS funny.  This book definitely contains some wonderful gems that had me chuckling out loud, and Sedaris is certainly still just as kooky as he was as a child, but instead of the usual five stars that I would give any work by Sedaris, this book gets four.

This is probably one of the funniest and most well written web videos out there.    The fact that it only costs [...] bucks on Amazon and you get the amazing extras makes it all the more worthwhile.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I cannot believe my ears!!  This is not the music of a musical icon 'hanging on'.  This is creative and challenging.  Paul reinvents himself here and blows away anyone that might be competing with him.  One of the best things I've heard in years.
B000001ZSF|5.0|I bought this album a few months back and, to put it simply it's been in my CD player almost constantly. Like Oxygene and Equinoxe, Chronologie fits together as one single piece of music divided into eight parts, each as different as possible from the one before it. I read reviews on Amazon, mostly favorable, one of which remarks that this CD would serve as an excellent soundtrack to a work of fiction, be it a story, film or video game. I can definitely understand and agree with his comments. In fact much of Jarre's music sounds to me like good material to use in video games. Chronologie in particular has, for me at least, a sound very fitting to, say, a Castlevania style game. Not necessarily creepy but certainly grand and, in its way, prophetic. Part one is a triumphant opening through and through. Track two puts me in mind of an intense battle, either between two powerful individuals or two massive armies. Track three is a quiet, almost dreamy sounding one, though not without its grandure. Just take a listen to the electric guitar about halfway through. Things pick up for most of the rest of the album, part four being particularly danceable. I also understand that Jarre set himself up with some new synthes for this album, but having no knowledge of synthesizers myself I couldn't identify them. But this album in particular has got me intrigued by the idea of learning to compose myself. I'm actually considering, thanks to this and the six other Jarre albums I own, buying a small collection of synthes of my own if and when finances permit, and making a hobby of it. Certainly I probably wouldn't be able to afford any of the synthes Jarre uses but I've seen some good ones at fairly reasonable prices.    This album is often haled as Jarre's last truly great album, and I must say I agree. I loved Oxygen 7-13, but it didn't quite capture the same brilliance of the prior Oxygene, nor of Chronologie, which in my opinion is just about as close as any of Jarre's later albumsever ccame to the greatness of Oxygene and Equinoxe. Needless to say I wholeheartedly recommend this album to any fan of Electronica, or even anybody who's just looking for a new and intensive listening experience. I'm not a big fan of electronica myself and yet I loved Jarre's early work.
0525951113|4.0|Daniel Suarez really proves to be an up and coming niche with this entry. It centers around a mysterious and destructive force that's utilizing the limitless expanse of the internet to unleash an high-tech murdering spree.<br /><br />The characters are very bold and well defined. They can be a bit predictable at times. For instance the gruff detective investigating the murders is very easy to liken to dozens of other such characters on TV, in movies, and in other literature. Other characters; however, provide a very vibrant and original presence in the book. They also display the author's level of knowledge on the subject.<br /><br />You'll aslo find that the world and corporations Suarez envisioned are very well defined. It has a feel not unlike the movie Lawnmower Man. Between the characters and the environment, I wouldn't be surprised if we see future appearances in Suarez's future works (assuming there will be more based on the response to Daemon).<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Daemon is for everyone. It does draw a pretty clear reader demographic amongst those who \\"know\\" the web, networking, or hacking. It doesn't exclusively exclude anyone, but you may find yourself a little lost by the minor details. Suarez does a decent job of bridging the concepts to the masses but there are just some aspects of the subject matter that doesn't naturally fall into the dialect or reveal.<br /><br />I've seen other mentions of the weak ending, but I think this is something you'll find amongst many new authors. It really seems that a riveting finale is a more senior achievement for writers and story tellers. Don't be scared away by the poor reviews of the end. It could have been stronger but definitely fits.<br /><br />Also available in Kindle edition which is a plus owners. The Kindle format of the book doesn't differ from the printed copy that I noted.<br /><br />To wrap up, my biggest complaints would be that it has a rather niche appeal and doesn't have the touch of an experienced author. Definitely worth a read though, especially for tech enthusiasts.especially for tech enthusiasts.

1591841992|2.0|The idea of using more visual elements to communicate is a good one and this book encourages everyone to discover their innate ability to create communicative images. Unfortunately, the book uses too many pages to communicate the point and seems to be written at too low an intellectual level. The author is taking simple but powerful concepts and trying to expand them rather than make the point and move one. For me, this lost my attention and interest. Shame because the concept is great. I don't care how many pages a book has but how many ideas and insights it delivers....
1439102813|4.0|In this book the author has set a very difficult task for herself and mostly she accomplishes it. If there's a problem it's that the writing rarely becomes sufficiently  compelling to make the reader feel that we really know what it is like to have Alzheimer's. The most convincing part is the opening of the narrative when Alice first discovers she has Alzheimer's. I have to admit it's a difficult  book to write because Alzheimer's is a disease that forces people to become increasingly disengaged from those around them (so there is a kind of internal contradiction that probably isn't resolvable).<br /><br />I got this book because my father was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This book was helpful in expanding my understanding of this debilitating ailment and helped me to broaden my compassion for those afflicted with this troubling and mysterious disease.

It's useful because it gives you a framework to identify and analyze the relationship between evidence and conclusion.<br /><br />The book gives you some questions to ask yourself about any Logic Game or Logical Reasoning stimulus.<br /><br />When to read it: Before you begin studying or when you need a break.
0143038419|5.0|There are so many things in life that are about timing; I find that connecting to a book is one of them.  If I had read this book years ago, it would have been just a nice summer read.  In terms of where I am in my life, looking for peace, this book has been inspiring. Gilbert put words to feelings and thoughts that I never knew how to express myself.  I am no writer. I will reread this book in a few years and see how many highlighted expressions and thoughts still resonate with me.  One of the best books I have ever and too marked up to let anyone borrow it.

I read one of your reviews and the writer was complaining about her status as a Professor at Harvard like she was \\"showing off\\", that gent just didn't get it, her career was such a big part of her life that how could she not mention it in many scenarios...    Loved it, a must read.
0679809015|5.0|Both of my kids (now 4 and 6) absolutely loved this book - my 6 year old in particular read it over and over and over and over (and over). Its' small size makes it great for little hands, though as others have noted it will take a little bit of work with the fine motor skills to get the flaps open. I always gave the flaps a little nudge to open them for my kids when they were to little to get them open.<br /><br />This is now a standard gift for all our friends and family members when they have a new baby.
1563894696|3.0|A spiritual successor to The Dark Knight, and Year One stories by Frank Miller, Batman The Long Halloween does do a decent job of telling a serial story spread over a year, but ultimately fails. Interesting in light of the recent Chris Nolan movies, because it provides the background story for Harvey Dent/Two Face, yet it is not nearly as satisfying as the Frank Miller stories, simply because it lacks the serious nature and cohesion of those stories. This was originally a serial. It is very obvious. The story is not written as a whole, as The Dark Knight is, but rather as a bunch of mini series written to correspond with holidays. Interesting at the time, I am sure, but as a graphic novel it loses the appeal. Not bad, not particularly good. Good artwork, and very lengthy, but as an actual story, it is weak. Take it or leave it.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I would recommend this DVD series to anyone that has a Interest in Documentaries and i can safely say you haven't seen anything like this before, the amount of detail this is out of this world and the high production values make this a must have for anyone with a slight interest in the world that surronds us. Buy this and I guarentee you wont be disappointed!

0920668364|1.0|We received this book as a baby shower gift for our son, who is now 6. I distinctly remember sitting down to read this book to him when he was just an infant. It is sweet to staart, but as I went along through both son and mother getting older, I could see where it was headed...and it wasn't somewhere I wanted to go. It was creepy enough when the mom picks up the teenage son at night, but when she puts a ladder on top of her car and drives across town to crawl in his window to \\"hold\\" him? Too much! And I get that it's a fact of life that mothers die at some point, but I really don't want that as part of a book for my infant/toddler child. I know others see this as a \\"must-have\\" book, but I'd say it's a \\"must stay away\\" book instead.
1401207529|4.0|It is great to see this, and get the background for the Chris Nolan Batman movies. It also does a decent job of telling the Batman origin story. It is not quite as strong as The Dark Knight (also by Frank Miller) but is still a must for any Batman graphic novel fan.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|This is an outstanding movie with genuinely charming characters. Rene Zellweger makes Potter her own and shows in her performance to be a head above the rest. Ewan McGregor does an ok with his usual charm in playing her shy suitor. This was a magnificent movie that had no bad language, explosions, car crashes, and relied totally on the story and character. Watching Beatrix develop from a withdrawn spinister into an self-governing woman in love. True love grows by inches and this is what was shown here, so when the kiss came it was powerful and had meaning.     This is really not a guy's movie. I loved it!

0452287022|2.0|This is something that I would read if I have a long wait in the doctor's office. The plot is interesting enough, but everything is lopsided and flat. There is not any real back stories to the characters themselves. A lot of things are based on local market gossip with almost no explination. What really bothered me is that Griet sounds more educated than she really is. She is barely semi-literate. It says in the book that all she knows is only to write her name and read her prayer book. She cannot read somebody else's hand writing or printed words in anything else. That really bothered me. We don't really get to know her family in depth and that was a big plot hole.
0670020478|1.0|The premise:  Find success stories of those who were criticized early in life by those who did not recognize their talents.  The plan:  Work backwards and say, \\"Wow!  They did it anyway.\\"    What an obtuse bore.  I saw this guy interviewed on Huckabee, too, and thought that the book would rate with a Malcolm Gladwell read.  Not even close.  There are few facts and longwinded observations that trek into the all too obvious.  I'm 53 pages in and feel like I haven't made it past the introduction.  It's a tedious read--one that would be assigned in an education class.  Not as bad as \\"Hooked on Books,\\" but it belongs on the same shelf.  It's no surprise to me that the author is an educator.      Blah. Blah. Blah.    What a serious disappointment.
0141030933|5.0|I first ran across Pat Barker when I read her newer book, Life Class, also a study of war, and an equally excellent book. Regeneration did not disappoint me. It is simply first-rate writing, about what war does to men, how it can wear them down, kill them on the inside, even when their bodies may remain whole. Barker's use of real people in fictional form makes Regeneration even more meaningful to the serious student of human nature and the awful effects of the violent and terrifying environment that is war, whether it's happening in 1917, 1950, 1970 or 2009. The poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, tragic figures I studied in college more than forty years ago, become real flesh and tortured idealistic people in Barker's hands. The central figure, Dr William Rivers, comes equally alive several decades after his death, as he contemplates the horrors of prolonged exposure to combat and trench warfare as well as the father-son relationship. Barker looks unflinchingly at the way war changes people and lives, with her finely wrought scenes of damanged men and women seeking solace and attempting furtive sexual congress in dark doorways and against moss-covered tombstones in country churchyards. It is not often that a woman writer gets inside men's heads and portrays them so accurately. I cannot recommend this book highly enough and will definitely seek out and read the other two books from the Regeneration trilogy. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY and LOVE, WAR & POLIO
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|So i don't understand that people don't like this movie because the storyline wasn't \\"as great as they thought.\\" This movie is about a monster that comes out of the sea and attacks NYC. Plain and simple, its fun, and different. I loved the way they filmed it. To me it did add a touch of realism as compared to other movies. Don't get caught up with what other people say if you haven't seen the movie. Just remember to have a open mind and remember its A MOVIE ABOUT MONSTERS.<br /><br />JJ Abrams did good on this and hopefully he will work his magic again on Star Trek
B00004XMV6|5.0|Fantastic movie. A real classic! Mickey and Kim at their finest. Starts off flirtatious and fun, ends up being dark. Very intense film.
0071120009|4.0|This book along with the digital upgrade still came out to be cheaper than buying the book from a university bookstore.  This book also happens to be huuuuuge so the digital upgrade is very convenient, although the amazon reader still has several kinks.
0486409511|1.0|This book (As many others ) do not teach the true forms of the letters used in the early 19th century. There are lot of cute swirls and many other things but for a person who has study Engrosser's Script (Copperplate) and has seen the examplars done by the great masters of calligraphy, this book will teach you Mrs. Winter's personal approach to the letters (which I respect) but as a calligraphy lover and as a person trying to keep this beautiful art alive I can only suggest you try the books written by masters.... like the Zanerian Manual. Once you have mastered the script taught in the Zanerian Manual you can easily duplicate most hands, including the one on this book.

0783240236|4.0|Made in the mid-Sixties, this film has no backing music and is shot mainly in the town of Bodega Bay, California.  Melanie Daniels (Tippy Hedren) is the daughter of the publisher of \\"one of the larger newspapers in San Francisco\\" and carries, along with her two surprise lovebirds, a sense of entitlement. Mitch (Rod Taylor) is a self-assured lawyer who lives with his widowed mother and young sister in Bodega Bay.     For some reason these characters are annoying from the get-go.  Melanie is precious about her entitlement, and Mitch is a little too smirky and cold.   As the horrific action progresses, we see these characters gain humanity.  This is the only lift in this film. This film is masterfully filmed.  The early scene of Melanie in the boat, in the middle of the bay, is especially memorable.      Hitchcock seemed to select the location, set up the characters, and then let the mechanics roll like a well-oiled machine. As smoothly as Melanie's sports car. But he inserts his trademark sadism in this movie.  People are targeted as individuals.  It is almost the mass that wins -- the mass of birds gathering along the coast. It is almost the fear of the individual that Hitchcock evokes.    The townspeople are afraid (superstitiously so) of Melanie, the gilded stranger who is so unlike them.  Melanie is hinted at being a bit stunted emotionally from not having known her mother. Mitch is hinted at having had affairs he drops because of his controlling mother. The person behind the facade, the things people hide -- these are the things that Hitchcock nags at, pokes his viewers with, and in his vision, these things are ominous.      At the end there is some assurance that \\"the military will be involved.\\"  Only a mass of anonymous men can fight the anonymous birds.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It's difficult to write anything new here, but I had to join the praises.  This show is an absolute breathtaking masterpiece.  I have NO idea how they put this thing together so brilliantly, but EVERYTHING about the show works.  I am a huge fan of shows like the sopranos, six feet under, etc., but this one tops them all.      As all have mentioned, the acting, writing, directing are all genius, and the show really works because it creates a family for the entire seven seaons.  In watching the show from start to finish, you notice that the same reporters are always present, the same small, bit players are all there.  The dedication that is shown really demonstrates that the cast knew they were a part of something special.  All of the small players crackle on the screen, and regulars are truly breathtaking.      You just watch this show and want the world to be run the way they portray the white house.  This is a show that should be required watching for every child in this country, and a wonderful show to feature to up and coming democracies, come to think of it.  Go out there and buy this incredible work of art.
B001DHE9KG|5.0|This DVD is a real treat!  The MET's production of Puccini's LA BOHEME is magnificient, perfectly sung, staged and video-recorded for DVD. As a set designer, I found the special backstage segments between the acts, absolutely fascinating - a glimpse of the mechanisms that move those lovely (and huge) Franco Zeffirelli sets.  The DVD picture quality is great, even under the actual theatrical lighting.  I totally recommend.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|It's just fun and entertaining. I loved the characters and they are well cast.    I saw it at the theatre then bought the dvd and enjoyed even more the second time.
B0018CVQFM|3.0|CSNY underachiever releases his retro. Give him props for just getting on with it while Neil farts around with technological constipation. Still, all in a mass here, you get the warts with the gems, and a lot of dross in between. Nash's strongest suit are his vocal contributions to the others. On his own as a songwriter he never really moved beyond the bubblegum and simple pop of the Hollies. Agreed, he's had his moments, most of which involve David Crosby's creative influence. The first three Crosby Nash records were terrific, as was Songs for Beginners. But this is also the guy who has some genuine howlers to his credit. The second solo record should never have been printed. Looking back, the CSNY Looking Forward was a disaster smeared largely by Nash's untuneful warblings, and twenty first century solo efforts have been instantly forgettable.  And that's a shame because Nash certainly has his heart in the right place, stands for th right things and comes across as a very thoughtful and contemplative guy. To paraphrase a song title by Ol Shakey, he should leave the driving to them. Ringo wasn't a songwriter either, but he did matter. And for the record, nobody needs to hear \\"Teach Your Children\\" or \\"Our House\\" ever again. No wonder Mitchell left him. They are cloying and dimly conceived adolescent drivel. Nash doesn't even look like he's enjoying them anymore anyway. So stop. And that goes for the rest of you. These two songs and \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" should carry a fatwa with them. That's enough.  So, if you still jones for the man who put teh soft into soft rock, this should satisfy the most saccharine addicted. It is all remastered and sounds amazingly present, but that only serves to underscore that what's on offer here are largely empty calories.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have done Debbie Siebers Slim in Six which was a good workout but focused too much on the thighs. Jillian's dvd is a great cardio workout. I do feel that there should be more abs, and more specification on what weight to use (3lb, 5lb etc...) I hate waiting on the intro to finish, and I add a lot more stretching when I am done with the workout. Other then those little flaws this gives an excellent overall workout routine, that will get you in shape. It seems really hard at first, but after a few days your endurance will be way up!
B0000039QA|4.0|First things first, before we dig in to the music itself, ive been reading through the reviews for this album and I honestly cannot believe how ignorant a lot of these \\"critics\\" come across, they read like they're 14 year olds trying to impress their friends. No im not saying you have to like this album, in fact for the longest time I wasnt all that impressed with it either, I would have a said a 3/5 would have done it justice, but when your whole review is spent bashing BIG and talking about how \\"2pac is teh greatest evar!\\" then we have a problem. I have a news flash for you, 2pac is no where near the greatest mc, neither is BIG, if you think either of them is as talented as the likes of Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap or Pharoahe Monch then you're fooling yourself. Both of them were extremely talented artist though and, believe it or not, its ok to like both of them, grow up people.    On to the album, ive spent enough time rambling so i'll try to keep this somewhat short and simple. This album is what today is considered a Hop Hop classic, I myself would agree with that even if I dont think the album is \\"Perfect\\". A Few annoying beats and shamefully shallow songs hold this back from greatness, as do a few weak guest spots from Diddy (no hate to Diddy, he's just not a very talented mc, ghostwriters or not).    The good things though really push this album to greatness, some wonderfully dark production that sets the perfect backdrop for BIG to paint his mafia style pictures over, some very ill flows that are always changing and evolving as the song moves along, and very diverse subject matter that should have a little something for everyone. Looking for a track to vibe too? Check Notorious Thugs, want some Raw New York Rhyming? look no further then the Preemo laced \\"Kick in the Door\\" (with BIG's subtle diss to Jeru the Damaja of course), or hell maybe you just wanna kick it with some friends and party, throw on \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\\" and let loose.     Overall Ilove this album, its grown on me the older I got, when I was younger and going through my whole \\"rebellious, I hate anything that sounds pop or mainstream\\" phase I couldnt stand this, but being older now and being able to enjoy all music has really opened my eyes to how great this is, its a shame he never got to follow this up, I would have loved to hear more of his story telling abilities, one of the only mc's to rival the legendary Slick Rick in my opinion. anyways check the album out, go in with an open mind, and discover what a truly rewarding experience it can be.
B000QGEB12|5.0|Awesome fun!  The characters are larger than life.  The plot is nicely woven together.  Fairly violent at times, so be careful if you have children viewers around.

This ain't Rockferry and it contains like only 1 song (albeit a good one) on Rockferry.  I swear Amazon switched album art.  ;)  Actually the album you get with the download says Rockferry.  Misleading!    Ah well I got in for $.99.  Still for others about to pay $6 or whatever, make sure what you really want isn't her Rockferry album.
068987474X|4.0|but of course we remain in denial and make excuses. I enjoyed the book, and I knew that there would be lots of scenarios in it that I would know first hand. It helps when you have a guy telling you the truth..and I believe he is, I have some male friends who agree. If you are wondering where your relationship is going, or why he doesn't call. He's just not into you. So the moral of the story..leave and find someone who is.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Elbow is a major hit in the UK and Australia but not here in the states.  Our loss!!  However, as this CD is passed around it most likely will climb the charts and the hearts.      The Seldom Seen Kid CD speaks to today's generation but could easily entice the older generations of the '60's - '80's as it did me. (I hear a touch of Alan Parsons Project -Beatles  - Chicago - and difinitely a bit of Leonard Cohen). BUT . . .Elbow is their own creation with their own sound.    Their sound is different but strangely familiar.  Each tune takes you on a journey of sound with an interesting message.  It's true that there really is not one bad song on the CD.  It's a journey.  An exhilarating journey!  Spread the word on this one.  Everyone who has heard it has been delightfully surprised.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I have been a fan of this Genesis era since I first heard Firth of Fifth back in the day.  This set really brings the music to life.<br /><br />The first DVD I listened to was \\"The Lamb\\".  There is a point in \\"Fly on a Windshield\\" where there is silence, and then the band comes crashing in with a sort of eastern-sounding drone.  When I heard that moment in surround, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.<br /><br />Even though all of the discs are incredible, the \\"Lamb\\" disc is worth the price of the whole set.  As the DVD plays, the actual background slides used in the original concerts are shown on the screen.<br /><br />Buy now!!!
031606792X|5.0|I personally thought these books were great, with that said...I have had enough of all the whining about how ppl expected more from the last book! Hello, for entertainment purposes only & written from the view of a teen! Of course there are things that make you go 'Ugh!, did I really just read that!' (remember, teen views) but its balanced well thru Edwards more mature character. What is really childish is everyone pretending to be the author or editor, whichever applies. If you dont like it, do the ADULT thing and give the book(s) to someone who does!  These books have passed thru many fingers in the tiny town I reside, all of us pushing 40+! Everyone here who has had the pleasure of reading them all have the same initial response...'Wow!' followed by 'Is there more? When will the movie be out?' And now, the news of the partial rough draft (Midnight Sun) on Meyer's site is spreading like wild fire...I cant speak for others but I read for the pure enjoyment of it. I like a good story and these books grabbed my attention, could not stop reading til there was nothing left to read, rough draft included! Would I like to see more along these lines - Of course I would! Would I like to see a more adult theme - Again, Yes! But I cannot bad mouth these books in any way, shape or form because I was quite entertained as I read them and as they pass from hand to hand around our small town they have generated a lot of talk (some of us have read all there is to read, and some not) those of us who have read everything talk quietly amongst ourselves, so as not to blow it for others, avoiding questions that would give things away to those not finished yet...I find it irritating that ppl feel the need to complain about an ending that did not suit their ideals, blowing the story wide open all over the net for others. Like it, dont like it - fine! It is your right to say so, either way. What you have no right to do is sit around and bad mouth someone elses hard work and time spent, ruining things for everyone else. Its inconsiderate and rude!

0913866156|3.0|This is a beautiful deck, but make no mistake, it was created to promote Aleister Crowley's religion, Thelema (Greek for \\"will\\"). These cards are the \\"gateway drug\\" of choice for Crowleyans who WILL try to recruit you given half a chance. They truly believe Thelema is the hope and salvation of all mankind. The group is hierarchical in structure and teaches that the \\"elect,\\" those at the top, will reign over the masses (who are only fit to serve) in the aeon (age) of Horus. They've been saying this since 1904 and still no Thelemic revolution, but it's gonna happen, honest.
B000000W5F|5.0|\\"Tatoo You\\" is one of those albums that seems to divide Stones fans as opposed to say \\"Let it Bleed\\" that we all agree on. I'm on the side of the fence that loves this album.    I never knew until years later after its' release that this collection of songs comes from different sessions and time periods. Perhaps thats what makes this album so interesting. It starts out with the monster hit \\"Start Me Up\\" which of course now you've head a bizillion times and still like it but just remember how amazing it was when you were first hearing it! It kicks off side one which had all the rockers on it, two of which flat out rock in \\"Hang Fire\\" and \\"Neighbors\\". These songs have mick using his rough rock voice and are a blast! \\"Slave\\" is a groove song that while pretty lengthy you just don't seem to get tired of. \\"Black Limousine\\" has harmonica in it and another great vocal by Mick that push this song to greatness. \\"Little T&A\\" is my favorite Keith fast song next to \\"Happy\\"   Side 2 (if this was an LP) is the slow side with one of the best overall batch of slow songs included on one album of any the Stones albums. \\"Worried About You\\",\\"Tops\\",\\"Heaven\\",\\"No Use In Crying\\" and of course \\"Waiting on a Friend\\" are all fantastic songs and all unique which makes them easy to listen to over and over. I really don't know which one of these songs is my favorite but that's what makes a great album because in my mind there is not a bad song on this album. One of the things I also like about this cd is that the sound of the guitars on some of these songs almost give it a \\"new wave\\" type of sound and really had a different sound then a lot of what was going on musically at the time. I will mention that this cd will always have a special place in my heart because it was the first Stones album I ever bought.

0743455967|5.0|Loved it. In fact, I'm still loving it because I keep referring to Stephen King's On Writing for reminders, tips, and examples of good and bad writing. Divided into three sections, the first one is about King's earlier life and how his experiences formed him as a writer.  While I enjoyed reading about his childhood and adolescence, especially his many antics, I particularly appreciated learning about his progression as a writer. Like other beginning writers, he had his share of rejection slips and instead of being embarrassed by them, he hung them on a nail. Fortunately for us, the young King kept plugging away at his craft, and later some of these slips had notes scrawled across them, thus encouraging him to continue his efforts.<br /><br />In the second section of the book, King stresses that writers are formed, not made, and says that while it's impossible to make a competent writer out of bad one, it is possible to make a good one out of a merely competent one...that is, if the person is dedicated, willing to work hard, and has timely help. He encourages would-be writers to have a toolbox and to put vocabulary and grammar on the top.  I'll evermore be cautious about using passive voice after his strong admonition against this weak, circuitous, and frequently tortuous verb tense.  I'll also never, never, never again write Thomas' bike instead of Thomas's bike. See what I mean about the tips??<br /><br />The third and final part of On Writing is actually a postscript about King's nearly fatal accident and his recovery afterward, both physical and otherwise.  Throughout the book, he talks about his wife Tabby and how essential their relationship is to his success. In the postscript, he reminds the reader of this as he tells of how she rigged up a space for him to begin writing again. \\"She got me positioned at the table, kissed me on the temple, and then left me there to find out if I had anything left to say. It turned out I did.\\"<br /><br />Go ahead.  Buy a copy of this combination autobiography and instruction and start reading. King says, \\"Reading is the creative center of a writer's life,\\" and this superb book on writing is well worth reading.biography and instruction and start reading. King says, \\"Reading is the creative center of a writer's life,\\" and this superb book on writing is well worth reading.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I'd expected the DualShock 3 to either have problems with SixAxis tilt functionality, or be a lot heavier, simply because they had to cram more technology into the same piece of plastic.  Instead, it turns out that everything works great:  the vibration comes through on any game I've played, PS2 or PS3, and yet the battery life still seems to be about the same as for a non-DualShock 3 wireless controller.  The controller is very lightweight, and the \\"rumble\\" effects are not jarring.  It also uses the same USB cable to charge with that the standard PS3 controllers use.<br /><br />Last but not least, SixAxis functionality works just fine--I tested it out on games like Heavenly Sword, where you spend long periods trying to hone the angle of an arrow or the tilt of a cannonball.  At this point if you're buying a controller, it doesn't make any sense *not* to go ahead and get the DualShock 3.
B001GCUNVM|1.0|Most reviews of this movie speak in superlatives, even the major newspapers. I must differ. For me, this praise shows how far we have fallen as a culture. We seem to no longer remember or appreciate movies with subtlety, intelligence, beauty, wit, grace, a good script, or good photography. None of these are in evidence in \\"The Wrestler\\". Instead we are given endless, overly long scenes of seedy behavior and places. It's geared to the lowest common denominator, as so many movies are today.   (Those who buy jeans with holes and dirt already manufactured in will probably think the movie is \\"cool\\"). Regarding the protagonist, we should know by now if one leads a life full of stupidity and bad decisions, the outcome will not be positive. So I won't dignify the movie with learned analysis, as so many misguidedly have. Captain Obvious could have written the script-predictable and trite all the way. Even the production quality of the movie was poor, with a grainy and shaky image (at least as I saw it in the theater; I haven't seen the DVD, so I can't speak to that). There have been many prize-fighter movies which had great dramatic quality, but this is not one of them. For example, \\"Champion\\", staring Kirk Douglas, was one such movie among others. I would rate that 4-5 stars.

Unfortunately we are very limited by our perceptions, and our willingness and ability to quantify.

B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it's just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general. But I can't put this ahead of Master Of Puppets.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The DS3 controller is nice, but it doesn't handle like a 360 controller.  If you have not yet gotten to hold and play with a xbox360.  Otherwise this is the best controller you can get for the PS3.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|This album was not a disappointment at all for me.<br /><br />I adored the first album: the pop-folksy feel, the sense of humor, the candid lyrics--all with catchy upbeat tunes!<br /><br />Don't quite have the new one memorized but it lives up to all my hopes and surpassed them in some noted cases (like \\"Him\\"!) She's a little more grown up and a little more produced in this album, but it's never too much. She retained the sense of humor and happy feeling. I love it!
B000AP04MO|4.0|This movie is absolutely spectacular.  Consider it the \\"indie film\\" of it's time, as it was created in 1967, but filmed in a non-linear fashion.  The story follows a couple by the names of Mark and Joanna Wallace through a series of trips to the South of France with one another.      The best part about the whole film is the fact that it feels so real.  The banter between the couple is witty, fresh, and relatable.  I highly recommend it.  Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn have great chemistry.
B001BVRNPW|5.0|Since I've seen this movie on dvd I can just tell you that I really love it, so I wanted to own it on BLU. Since there is no planned release in Germany and the Stargate movie BLU and SG-Continuum BLU were region free, I hoped it would be the same here. But it isn't.    The Ark of Truth is region-A ONLY! German codebound players and Playstation 3 won't play it at all. It would be nice from Amazon to include the Blu-Ray region code in future product descriptions.
0316017922|5.0|It's a quick read with fascinating information about the various and surprising factors that create \\"outlier\\" or huge success.  It's not what we've come to believe - personal effort, bootstrapping, persistence, etc.  The core of success can come from very different sources, like your birthdate for example, although not for astrological, reasons.  There are also the circumstances - personal,cultural and historical - and other particular forces and nuances that can contribute to any one individual's success.    Those who are raised to succeed by these forces, however, do play a role in being prepared and seizing the opportunities.  Had a Joe Flom or a Bill Gates made another decision at the point of opportunnity, we may never have heard of them or may be talking about someone else.  This is where the book also lends a somwhat fatalistic or deterministic sense to its message: if you weren't born at a particular time or the beneficiary of a particualr trend, the you somehow lost out.  But that just can't be true, and there are so many ways in which others can succeed and at so many other levels.  If Bill Gates is at the top of the computer geek wealth pyramidm, there is plenty of room at the levels below.    This is a book that should be read and understood by the A-Rod's and other self-absorbed superstars of the world, who are not self-made successes only but successes made, in some way or another, by their circumstances.  At the same time, readers should take into account the lack of balance in presentation, as other revieweres have pointed out, and the overwhelming reliance on anecdote and apparently biased selection of case studies.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|While there seems to be a lot of rallying support for \\"the new Bond\\", I can't say that I'm with that group at all.  Casino Royale was \\"ok\\" and certainly 1000% better than the Woody Allen/Peter Sellers sham, but compared with more traditional Bond movies, I felt it left a great deal to be desired.    First there was the tragic demise of a well established timeline.  This could have been easily avoided by simply adding that the \\"previous\\" Bond had retired (or been killed) and that the new agent was simply replacing his predecessor, the way \\"M\\" and \\"Q\\" had been replaced as the actors portraying them aged and/or passed away. To \\"re-envision\\" such a well established franchise completely without paying tribute to that which has come before was simply a mistake.    Then there is Daniel Craig's less than impressive portrayal of one of the most well known \\"action heros\\" of all time.  Let's face it here...whether you are a fan of the books or the movies, when someone mentions the name \\"James Bond\\", it provokes a certain mental image.  Regardless of who has portrayed Bond in the past, there is an image of a suave, sophisticated individual usually wearing a tux, drinking a vodka martini (shaken, not stirred).  The image certainly includes having a beautiful woman on his arm, fancy gadgets to help him out of a tight spot and that attitude that \\"laughs in the face of danger\\"...usually accompanied by a \\"pithy come back\\".  With the introduction of Daniel Craig in Casino Royal, gone is the tongue in cheek humor that typically accompanies the James Bond persona.  To me this was a tragic mistake as it is simply a part of who James Bond is.  In the Bond movie \\"Golden Eye\\" for example, there is a scene where Bond (portrayed excellently by Piece Brosnan) crashes a tank he is driving in a chase scene (wonderful in it's own right!).  The camera zoom's in on Bond as he pauses, straightens his tie then continues with the chase.  Truly a wonderful moment of humor to say the least!  There areno such \\"moments\\" with this new Bond...he is simply a man with a bad attitude and \\"a chip on his shoulder\\" who's out to prove himself against the world.  With Craig's portrayal, the character of James Bond could have just as easily been a disgruntled shoe salesman who's forced to smell stinky, fat feet day in and day out.   I'm sorry to say but Craig does a very poor job of \\"filling the shoes\\" of his predecessors.     To use a food analogy, if you make spaghetti sauce without any spices what so ever, all you end up with is tomato soup.  Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is watery tomato soup at best.  While Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan (and even Dalton and Lazenby) all brought something new and unique to the role, they all managed to maintain the principle character that is \\"Bond\\".  Here particularly, Craig falls abominably. While it is a ok action film with a fairly average plot (save the world...yawn), there is nothing in Craig's portrayal that really says \\"James Bond\\" in any way.  The character names could have been easily changed and very simply, it would not have effected this movie at all (and probably would have been for the better).       Gone too are the wonderful gadgets that are so iconic of James Bond movies.  While a good story line is certainly the greatest success of any film let alone \\"Bond\\", high tech gadgetry is something that most loyal fans have come to expect (for example the submarine Lotus in \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\"...priceless!).  When watching James Bond using many of these devices, one can easily hear Q's words of wisdom saying \\"Grow up 007!\\".  Such things are now apparently a part of the distant past.  Apparently all a modern secret agent needs any more to defend himself against the evils of the world is his ever loyal and faithful cell phone.    For the sake of fairness, I will add that there have certainly been other Bond \\"flops\\".  Connery's \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\", Moore's \\"Man With The Golden Gun\\" and \\"Moonraker\\" and Brosnan's \\"Die Another Day\\".  I guess even the best of Bonds are entitled to having a bad run.  That said, it appears that this may not be a one time event due to the fact that the producers seem to want to take Bond in a new (and horrifying) direction.  We loyal Bond fans can certainly hope but none of us should hold our breath for too long either.     Final Thoughts...  For those who are looking for an average action film with the proverbial explosions and car chases and an otherwise average plot, you will probably be satisfied with \\"Casino Royal\\".  However for those like me who are long time fans of the James Bond franchise and all that it represents, you will probably be sorely disappointed.  In and of itself it was an \\"ok\\" movie but it certainly wasn't \\"Bond\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  It would have been better to simply change the character names and call this film something else and just let the Bond franchise rest until something better and more appropriate came along.

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|What garbage!  I got this version of the DVD for the Special Features, you know the stuff where they talk about how they made things, the cars, the suit, the sound and music, the stunts, costume, all that stuff.  Well, this version just didn't have that.  They had like 12 min of the making of!  That's it.  Music, Bat suit, and Bat pod.  Then the rest was an IMAX aspect ratio of some of the scenes in the movie, THE MOVIE THAT IS ON THE DISK ONE.  Why do I need to see those scenes again?  Then the rest of disk two is fake news stories called Gotham Tonight or something.  I figured that they just didn't make these features that I wanted to see, which I find hard to believe because they pretty much knew that it was going to be a big movie judging from the success of the first one, so where is the making of stuff?  (Not on this version so save yourself the trouble of looking here.)  So I start talking to my friend, and he has all the special features that I would like to see, but they are on Blue Ray.  WHAT A RIP OFF!  I did not pay the extra money for that.  I realize that the term \\"Special Features\\" is a pretty loose in definition, but they knew the stuff that I wanted to see, so they put that on the blue ray and gave me a bunch of trash.

630021463X|5.0|With just 4 words William Shatner placed himself in upper echelon of comedic timing and set the true tone of this hilarious feature film.<br /><br />While not a great \\"Star Trek movie\\" in the traditional sense, The Voyage Home provides wonderful character moments and drama without resorting to formulaic conventions of the series. The last few minutes also provide great closure to the lingering plot threads from the 2 previous films that is very satisfying.<br /><br />The other plus for the film is the fact that it shows that you can have action/adventure without a villain or violence, just tension and anticipation. This really is family entertainment and it's no surprise it was so popular.
0812580346|3.0|Just finished reading thought was a pretty good and easy read.. As a futurist, missed a few things about 2009 such as the use of video tape. Most modern high tech and high security installations now use digital for secrity survalance.. However he did call it right on who the Pope would be... one of the news digest bits at the beginning of one of the chapters mentions the pope as being Pope Benedict XVI, who became pope in 2005 about 6 years after he wrote the book...
B000P12LWY|3.0|I generally like the HBO and Showtime series, and I really enjoy gritty, historical settings, but I just finished the first season and I feel mostly bored by it.  The occasion outdoor shots are magnificent, but mostly we're indoors in the court, which seems like a small, and very obvious, set.  It gets repetitive and claustrophobic that every quarter of an hour or so, somebody arrives, we get the camera shot from the balcony onto the set, the same old minstrel music plays, the extras wave their fans and do the obvious stagey whispers to each other, and someone walks in, and we wait to see if young Henry will be happy or irritated. Henry is played as mercurial, but it's a constant one note performance, and like everyone else (except for one of his friends, a handsome womanizer whom he elevates to nobility), we really don't care for any of the characters.  Sam Neill is the only one who tries to vary his lines, but he doesn't have a lot to work with, as his character, too, is two-dimensional.  A lot of people obviously like the show, based on reviews here, but I kept waiting for something other than a belabored plot twist, to make me care about the characters or what might happen next.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Converting all of my LP's to digital thanks to this machine. It is so easy and don't know why some people cannot listen to the music as it is being recorded. If you set up your Audio to use the USB turntable as the sound input and your computer speaker system as the output BEFORE you turn on the Sony software then there will be no problem listening to the LP. Would definitely recommend this product for price, ease of use and quality.

0307269752|3.0|The best thing about this book is the girl with the dragon tattoo.  Lisbeth is a fascinating character, who's been through so much in her young life and has been left damaged, but brilliant, tough, but vulnerable.  The sections of the book in which she appeared are the best and the ones I looked forward to the most. I like how she still had mystery about her even at the end of the book, with all of our questions about her not answered and our curiosity not completely satisfied.<br /><br />I do have to admit that the Swedish place names and character names took a lot of getting used to. I guess I haven't read a book set authentically in Sweden before. But I loved the setting---it made this book even more interesting and different.<br /><br />The author does a good job tying all the things together, although all of the characters in the Vander family can get confusing--in spite of the chart. This is an entertaining, interesting read that can be hard to put down.
6304819935|5.0|This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.    There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.    My main complaint is that there are not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!    Whatever,  I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campbell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times over but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campbell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence, as mainly a tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. At least that's the way I saw it.    Now that's out on Blu-Ray, I have to check it out again.

0790729601|4.0|A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?    One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. \\"Eraser\\" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.    This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!    The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining.
B00005JPO1|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005JPO1 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] declares to the world that Indiana Jones is back and in good form.  While one may be put off by the reviews that claimed that Indy had gone science fiction, the science fiction content of this new film is minimal and the movie, as a whole, is an action-adventure tale not unlike the previous three movies.  The desire of the filmmakers to replicate the look and feel of the new film even compelled them to record in the action on analog film.  The extra DVD is full of production diaries and other documentaries on the film making process.

B00000F169|3.0|[[ASIN:B00000F169 Dark Star]] was a 1974 student film by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon.  Because it is student film, the special effects were pretty amateurish, even by the standards of the 1970's.  What this film lacks in special effects is more than made up by the quality of the writing.  The character Sgt. Pinback, played by Dan O'Bannon, is one of the most memorable characters in all of media science fiction.  Late in the film, the philosophical consequences of phenomenology are explored by an artificial intelligence that interacts with the crew of the ship.
0743297334|5.0|I hope no one finds this offensive but just remember that I really like Hemingway's writing style. That being said, to be as pithy as possible, this book and my modern day translation of the meaning of the story \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is the same as our modern day saying \\"Same old $hit\\". The story at first brought out my empathy for Jake(aka Hemingway)who is essentially writing about his messed up life. Unbelievable! The most beautiful and wealthy people have the most dysfunctional lives. The book left me feeling a little disgusted at the end. Not that is wasn't good or well written but that the moral was that some people never learn how to get their lives in order. Oh Well. I guess for some of us, thats life!
B000063UR1|4.0|[[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]] is an excellent example of the environmental science fiction film of the 1970's.  While I remembered the film being run on television in the late 1970's, it was great seeing it on DVD again, and the DVD special features about the making of Silent Running were also good.

Frances zu Vichy.(an organ which though quite modern has fallen into hopeless disrepair since these recordings were made in the early 90's.)the recordings are perfectly miked(good reverb) drawing in all the brilliance and sparkle of the positiv flutes and the wonderous raspiness of the posaunes. Ulrik Sprang-Hanssen's effort in these recordings is flawless & delightful. the discs are divided up into the six seasons of the liturgical church year.i have one major issue with this set,however,there are NO notes,registrations,just brief data recording when and where they were recorded.anyway,it's fun to look up the organs and compositons on Google while listening.the Aubertine in Vichy has quite a story.5 starz even sans the booklet.this is excellent Baroque Organ on real Baroque organs,played by a master intrepeter.

B001O2MBOQ|2.0|BUYER BEWARE!! This is the first Blu-ray disc which  is supposed to play in regions A,B, and C, but it did not play on either one of my SONY Blu-ray players which have up to date firmwares. I believe the problem is that the standard and Hi-def content was encoded at 25 frames per second which is considered PAL, and will NOT play on U.S. Blu-ray players. I am returning my copy to AMAZON, and I hope they become  aware of this incompatibility issue, and can replace these with compatible discs.This is a fabulous film which deserves to be watched in HIGH DEFINITION.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|If you liked the movie & you liked the soundtrack, then you have to get  this. Vangelis has done a excellent job on this one. The bonus material  and the 3rd CD BR 25 with new ideas are all excellent.
B000002J2D|4.0|I credit Genesis with being the ONLY band who could elevate what was obviously a minor work into the stratosphere like this.
031606792X|5.0|I ordered this book through Amazon.com and recieved it within three days. No hassle, no fuss. My daughter loved this book. She already read the first part of the series and was very anxious to get this latest book, and she loved it.
B000P7V46C|4.0|4 1/2    I find that W&W onward can accompany the win-some-loose-most remastering better, since improving technology allowed for a cleaner, clearer and more balanced sound then some of more statically methodical re-recordings from before '76. ATTWT continues to refine creeping pop sensibilities and consciously step away from the epics (although the micro-epic is still ever-present) while still retaining a powerfully intoxicating edge, and a scary consistency despite everything your early-leaning, Gabriel-era tendencies tell you... fueled primarily, and refreshingly by Banks.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have never actually seen the Broadway show, but it's something that I plan to do in the future when the opportunity presents itself because this music is just too good, and the story is imaginative, and witty. I used to hate musicals before I listened to Wicked, and now I've opened my eyes up to a lot of the possibilities that musicals have, and have begun to explore them more deeply, and found myself enjoying them greatly.    Song by Song:  1. No One Mourns The Wicked- 10/10- This song is excellent. I think it shows in the first song that the whole musical is going to be amazing, and it really sets the stage. Kristen's vocals are great on this, and so are the lyrics.  2. Dear Old Shiz- 4/10- It's not very long, and not important, so that's why I gave it a four. I feel like this song could be incorporated into another song just as easily and no one would notice. But I do love Kristen's one run in this near the end.  3. The Wizard And I- 8/10- This one took me a while to get used to, but once I really listened to the lyrics I really started to love it, and Idina has amazing vocals near the end.  4. What Is This Feeling?- 10/10- I loved this song from the beginning. It's catchy, and Idina and Kristen have such great chemistry here, and it enhnaces the song so much.  5. Something Bad- 8/10- I actually really really like this song, but I think it took a little bit of time to warm up too, but when Dr. Dillamond starts making goat songs it just makes the song,  6. Dancing Through Life-10/10- This song is absolutely excellent. One of the best, it's very long, and I love the singing by Michelle Federer (Nessarose), and the guy who plays Boq. The whole cast begins to sing in this one, and it's just an incredibly fun song.  7. Popular- 10/10- This was probably my very favorite song when I first started listening to the cd, and it just gets better the number of times you hear it. The lyrics are hilarious.  8. I'm Not That Girl- 10/10 - this song is heartbreaking, but amazing, a solo by Idina that really shows a lot of excellent emotion from her.   9. One Short Day- 6/10 - I don't like this song as much as the others, but it is upbeat, and it shows a different side of Glinda and Elphaba's relationship so it's a necessary song.  10. A Sentimental Man- 7/10 - This one too took a while to warm up to, but the lyrics are good, and joel grey is an excellent singer.  11. Defying Gravity- 10/10 - if I was going to defy the scale and give it more I would. Idina's vocals are breathtaking, and shocking on this song, and honestly it makes me a little jealous that she can sing so good. Absolutely amazing, it gives me chills every time i hear it.  12. Thank Goodness- 9/10- I haven't always liked this song, but it gets better every time I listen to it, and Kristen is hilarious on this one.  13. Wonderful- 9/10 - this song gets better and better as I hear it, and joel grey is actually quite fun, and a great singer. His lines come off very comical, and you really understand a lot more about his character throught his song.  14. I'm Not That Girl (reprise)-7/10- Short, but necessary, and goood vocals from Kristen.  15. As Long As You're Mine- 10/10 - the vocals are absoltely excellent on this song, and it's one of the ones that really makes me feel the emotion and sadness of Elphaba's life. The vocals are excellent.  16. No Good Deed-10/10- I absolutely love this song. you really feel Elphaba's pain once again, and it's just a pleasure to listen to.  17. March of the Witch Hunters- 9/10 - I love this song. It's very short, but it really gets you into the marching spirit.  18. For Good-10/10- Both Idina and Kristen are excellent on this song. Very emotional, probably the most emotional song on the cd, and the vocals are excellent, as well as the music is well written, as are the lyrics. It's the song you would cry at if you were going to.  19. Finale- 8/10 - a good ending for the musical, not particularly fun to listen to, but it fits very well.    anyways, if you like musicals, or if you don't - buy this cd. you won't be dissapointed :)
B00005S6K6|3.0|I like the people in the movie, It has a happy ending, but getting there is many times just slow.  Its a good movie, but you really have to want to stick with it.  I recommend it for a rainy afternoon, when you're on a movie marathon.
0679721037|5.0|I agree with some of the comments about the one-sided-ness of this book.  However, Mr. Hersey was telling the story of six people in Hiroshima.  The context of the war is implied.  The context of the reasons for dropping the A-Bomb on Hiroshima, is implied.  This story, I believe, is an attempt to let us see the consequences of that fateful day, through the eyes of those that lived it.  I have also read Iris Chang's \\"The Rape of Nanking.\\"  I've read other books that detail the atrocities of both the Japanese AND the Nazis.  This book, \\"Hiroshima\\" is a unique glimpse into the lives of the residents of Hiroshima.
B0000255AR|3.0|I bought this album becoming hopeful that i would hear an ALL ORIGINAL KISS album (like Rock and Roll Over), and as it turns out the original members played on only 3 tracks. The remaining tracks are quite good, but lack the \\"swagger\\" and \\"charisma\\" of Ace and Peter's contributions. For that, it becomes just another KISS record to me. I suppose that's what makes Alive! such a great recording.     This most especially holds true for Peter Criss. Anyone who has doubts to the man's capability and timing should listen to Into The Void, or 100,000 years on ALIVE! That is (for me) one the the first (and best) heavy metal drum solos of all time.     Believe it (3)!

B000AGTPUU|5.0|This dvd had to replace the previous Polar Express DVD.  My 2 year old watches this movie at least twice a day!  We have one at the grandparents home and one at our home.  My son will recite lines from the movie!
B000002LOE|2.0|Wow I hadn't thought about this album for awhile and decided to take a look at what people had said about it over the years.  I'm shocked by all the positive reviews.  I think it's god awful from a band I really loved at one point.  The songs are trite, the production is made for pop sensibilities and the band had lost it's edge.  Now you want REM at their peak?  My choice would be Reckoning or Fables of the Reconstruction.  this one doesn't come close.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|I though it was very entertaining and being a girls girl I can appreciate the relationship between the actresses. I am not saying is Oscar worthy but I will definetly recomend it as a chick flick :)  The delivery scene was hysterical (at least to me since I'm expecting myself).
6305428387|5.0|Ilike this movie a lot because John Candy is funny. It has a very good story line good for the whole family.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I got it very prompt, a very good deal, so far in very good condition, (I haven't watch all of the cds yet) the price was right.
B000B7TLT8|5.0|Love The Crow and love the PSP.  What more do I have to say...oh yeah--love the price!
032147404X|5.0|Great read for amateur digital photo enthusiast. Lots of good information presented in a very readable format.
B000P7V45S|5.0|I bought this disk along with the 1970-1975 boxed set. I will probably go back and buy \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" too. I have been a Genesis fan since 1975, when, get this, my mother brought home \\"Genesis:Live\\" from the library! \\"Haven't you heard of these guys, dear?\\"  I will never be able to repay her. Since then, I've always loved the band with Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett. The first few albums where Phil Collins took over front-man duties were good (\\"Trick\\" and \\"Wind\\" being the best), but once Steve Hackett left the band, to me, their writing style became more \\"pop\\", and I haven't bought a Genesis album since \\"Duke\\".    That said, I am quite delighted with this new release of \\"Trick of the Tail\\". Oh, I must say that, as of this writing, I have not listened to the CD yet, only the DVD in Surround. I will assume (possibly incorrectly?) that the CD sounds as good, as far as overall mix, as the DVD but minus the surround.    I've read other reviews of this and other new Genesis disks and don't understand why some folks don't like it. (\\"I don't need to hear every stinkin' note Steve Hackett ever plucked\\" or words to that effect) It makes me wonder if their system was properly calibrated. To me it all sounds GLORIOUS!  Hearing some of my life-long favorite music in such wonderful detail is breath-taking. \\"Entangled\\", especially the last part, just washes over you with the finger-picked 12-strings, mellotron and synth, then jolts you with the downbeat of \\"Squonk\\".     I really appreciate the DTS 96Khz/24-bit version, you can just about hear Phil breathe in-between phrases, and you get a little more \\"space\\" around the instruments. And this allows you to hear things in each instrument that you may have never noticed before.    But what I really REALLY appreciate is the inclusion of some concert footage from the 1976 tour with my other fave drummer, Bill Bruford! I didn't get to see this tour and was really bummed about not getting to see Bruford playing with Phil, and now, IHAVE! Rapture! 8^) And the band interviews are fascinating for a Genesis geek, very insightful. Each album has an interview talking about the album at hand, fun stuff!     If you like this album in vinyl, you'll love it in DTS 96/24, and if you like \\"early Genesis\\" I HIGHLY recommend getting the 70-75 boxed set. I never got to see them with Peter, and several of the disks in the box include performance videos (mostly from European TV) of the band with him in full glory, masks costumes and all! HEAVEN!! Ever seen them perform \\"Suppers Ready\\" with Peter? Neither had I! Now I have TWO versions! I finally have a sense of what they were like back then, and to me, that is something rare and special.
B00004SZWD|5.0|A masterpiece in the world of music. The CD is a wonderful smooth sound you will never forget. This is what music is support sound like.
B000YAA68C|1.0|I was very excited to see this film because I had read - and loved - the novel by Cecelia Ahern. The novel tells a charming and bittersweet story of a young Irish widow (living in Ireland) and her journey to build a new life after her husband dies of a brain tumor. The title, the character names and the device of the letters are practically the only elements of that story that remain in the film.<br /><br />To begin with, the story is relocated to New York which did nothing to enhance its appeal. Americans also enjoy movies set in other locales (remember Circle of Friends, Notting Hill, Chocolat, etc.). Also, the casting of Swank did not seem to fit the Holly character portrayed in the book. For that matter, the character written for the film did not match the more spirited and likable widow of the book. Overall the screenplay was poorly written and the extensive rewriting made what had been an uplifting story more of a gloomy movie. In fact, the movie has a pervasive feeling of gloom (as opposed to grief). In the book, Holly and her husband had been happy together, though this does not come through as clearly in the movie. While Holly had not been as fulfilled in her work, she seemed to have been a happy person. Again, the movie Holly was quite different. I was actually relieved when it was over.<br /><br />Given the glowing reviews others have posted, perhaps the movie is only terribly disappointing to those familiar with the novel. If you have read and enjoyed the book, be prepared to see an entirely different version of the story if you decide to purchase this film. You might want to Netflix it first.
B001AKJ97O|5.0|I love Adele!!!! She is so amazing and talented! I have followed her from the days when she only had a few demos on her MySpace! So to see her grow this much and become more and more famous makes me so happy! This album is spectacular and one of my favorites for sure!    Bottom Line: Buy this amazing album and discover the amazingly talented and beautiful Adele!!! :)
B0016MOWP0|4.0|I'm reviewing the Blu-Ray, not the movie.    It's a decent transfer. Looks about as good as you would expect from an early 90s film. Maybe a little better. Sounds good too. Recommended if you like this movie.    One thing to note is that this is 2.35:1 widescreen, which is what was shown in theaters. However, since it was shot on non-anamorphic Super 35, it's vertically cropped from the 4:3 TV/VHS version, so although you are seeing what you would have seen in theaters (and I'm guessing what was on the DVD release), and you are seeing a little bit more on the sides, you might notice that the frame is cropped from your VHS copy. But that's not a big deal, and is typical for films shot on Super 35.
0525951113|3.0|As others have said here, this book has a strong beginning. It then abandons a main character in mid-game, so to speak. In the end, other main characters are just suspended or left to literally drift away or simply lifted off stage in a helicopter with no explanation as to what happens/happened next. The climax isn't, and the wrap-up is weak and then, as an afterthought, the author adds text that seems to beg for a sequel.    This book has a number of wonder reviews on the back by people not otherwise known for their critiques of books. That should say everything one needs to know, but let me provide this further note: this book is like taking a wonderful Sunday drive that ends up with a flat tire ten miles from the closest service station. It is an entertaining read, just don't expect a satisfying conclusion.    Don't get me wrong. I will buy other books by Mr. Suarez and I look forward to his next novel(s). I'm just saving my rave reviews for his next works, which I'm sure will be much better and more accomplished.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This is what Enya is all about. After the disaster that was Amarantine (let's be honest here, that one only contained three really good tracks) And Winter Came doesn't contain a single weak entry and several brilliant tracks. Beautiful songs, great arrangements, flawless sound (nothing new there, even Amarantine sounded great) AND a hint of something new, for once: a guitar solo on My, My, Time Flies, and a really good one, too.    Welcome back, Enya. I knew you hadn't lost it
B001LPWGE6|4.0|I would agree with most of the positive reviews but had one issue (beyond the box opening trick).  The box indicates that the English audio is DTS-HD Master Audio and the only other english version appears to be analog stereo.  The movie intro comes up in 5.1 on my Panasonic DMP-BD35K player, but dropped out when the movie proper started (using the Toslink).  Quite startling.  My older processor is able to handle the Dolby 5.1 PCM but doesn't decode DTS or DTS HD Master audio.  TV speakers worked via HDMI audio and the player RCA analog out worked - which is how we watched it.  This detail not clear on the Amazon site, but is on the box fine print.  A new processor with the newer high def audio capabilities and HDMI switching is moving up the priority list...(or maybe a step-up player that also decodes) or maybe I've missed something along the way.  Thought it merited mentioning however.
0811806405|3.0|This is almost two books in one.  One is classical guitar building one is steel string.  As a book I used in the shop, the duality made it hard to follow.  The authors also assume you already have woodworking skills and tools.  For a beginner there are better and easier ways to do things.   Many of the techniques and materials suggested are outdated.    That being said, this is the most thorough step by step book available.  I bet this book would have been great, when it was first written.  There is a huge amount of information out there, on updated techniques, especially jigs and fixtures for the beginner, they just aren't in one place.    If someone doesn't beat me to it, I might write a book on this subject, because a current, and complete how-to for beginners does not exist.    All that being said, you should buy this book, but you also need to get several others as well as consulting internet sources and forumns.

B00005JPKE|1.0|Completely revisionist history.  Pure fictional garbage sold to the mindless masses as truth - look at all the positive reviews.  These people foolishly pour accolades upon this film as if it was a historical documentary.  Ridiculous!  The Japanese committed countless horrific atrocities against most of Asia and were without honor and integrity in the way they treated POW's.  They made the Germans seem merciful and tame in comparison.  Just ask any WW II vet.      The Japanese, even to this day are in denial of the truth and re-write their grammar school textbooks, omitting the atrocities and painting themselves as defenders and war heroes instead of the imperialist instigators that they truly were - thanks Clint for helping them to continue perpetuating the lies by making this movie.  Most Japanese even deny that the Rape of Nanking ever occurred - one of the most detestable acts of genocide ever committed.  Raping women, even pregnant women and then bayoneting them and the unborn babies to death.  Whatever horrific act you can imagine, the Japanese committed it and then some.  Just google Unit 731 if you don't believe me.  All of this is in stark contrast to Germans, who very adamantly teach their kids about the Holocaust and why it was wrong in hopes that something like that will never happen again.  The Japanese just want to white wash history and have no interest in perpetuating the truth.    This movie is an inane melodramatic tall tale, but far worse than that, it is a horrible slap in the face of all the American and allied soldiers that defended our freedom and justice.      ***In reply to J. Thompson***    I'm both shocked and bewildered that a \\"teacher\\" could be so naive and ignorant. A simple google search would yield a wealth of articles about Japan's revisionist tendencies toward their own history. You do know what google is, right? No, I'm not talking about blogs, or small time publications, but major newspapers. Here is just a sampling to get you started...    [...]
B000V4UFZK|2.0|I'm sorry to say that this is probably one of the lamest horror films I've ever seen.  If you're a casual movie-goer, the dumbed-down, cheap scares might be to your liking, but for horror-lovers, I reccomend staying away.  For one thing, Spielberg is not a horror movie director, and it shows.  There is no sense of style, pacing, or atmosphere to the film.  In fact, only a pointless gore scene halfway through and a few cheap jump scenes throughout could justify this as a horror movie.  Actually, for me the most frightening part was that Tobe Hooper, the mastermind behind 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' was involved in the making of 'Poltergeist.'  For another thing, it's hard to fear the movie's antagonists when they are not only continuously relied on for laughs, but also lack any sort of mystery or menace.      All in all, this is a horror film for people who don't like horror films.  If you've seen masterpieces such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', '[rec]', 'Halloween', 'The Thing', 'The Sixth Sense', or even (dare I say it?) 'The Blair Witch Project', however, you'll probably be bored.  Poltergeist feels like a popcorn family movie that had a few scenes added to market it as horror.  The effect, I'm afraid, is not good.  Don't waste your time.
B00005CDNK|1.0|If those guys were trying to get rid of & bury Abba they succeeded with this album.  I've read it was their last & it should have been.  Cover is very dark & gloomy & the music doesn't have the joy that Abba had.  I was very disappointed.
B000NJMJGG|1.0|Movie never played. I put dvd in pc and opened it and found a bunch of files that had no program for. Movie didnt play and picture on DVD looked very suspicious. The wrapper did not have a hologram on it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Rarely does a short get as much of my respect as DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG. The sheer imagination of mixing pop culture references with a musical, adding a good-guy villain, a wicked sense of humor, and a fantastic surprise ending, make this one of the best TV comedies I've ever seen. Brilliantly acted, hysterical (truly laugh out loud!), and with a highly polished film style and technique, the exploits of Dr. Horrible and his arch nemesis The Hammer are an instant classic.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We got this game for our 10 year old daughter who is difficult to buy for, not being interested in Bratz, etc.  Our whole family loves to play.  The adults are challenged, and so are the 10, 8, and 6 year olds.  I love how it teaches strategy and helps kids learn to plan ahead for themselves and anticipate the moves others might make.  Even our younger kids, ages 4 and 2, are entertained watching us because of the bright colors and interesting designs that are made on the board during play.      It really is easy to learn how to play.  A bonus is that there are no batteries and it promotes family interaction.  Even one of our kids who hates to lose enjoys playing because he can find success in placing some of the more difficult pieces.    One of the pieces did break in two shortly after we got it.  We carefully super-glued it  back together, and have enjoyed it trouble-free since then.  Overall, a great buy.  I would definitely get this game as a gift for our friends.
0743243153|5.0|You really can't go wrong with Scott Peck. Every concept is a dosis of spiritual growth from the perspective of a man who combines intelligence, insight and psychiatric experience with a spiritual background. He is a Christian but does not shove Christial ideals down our throats. He communicates spiritual truths and it all makes alot of sense. I found this book to be uplifting and a massive inspiration. I send my hearty thanks to the auther.
0743455967|5.0|Steven King shared his expertise on the craft of writing in his book, \\"ON Writing\\". Mr. King is a teacher, humble in his presentation and even self-defacing when a point was made that would help one write better books. His book \\"On Writing\\" solidifies the fact that Steven King is a premier writer of books in our time. He passes his experience on to others with clarity and humor, showing examples that instruct.<br />An extra, at the end of a good tutorial, is a piece that tells of his being hit by a van while walking down a lonely road in Maine.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|The acting, story lines, and overall drama are terrific in this fourth installment of the Lost series.  The episodes have great impact when you are able to watch several together, without commmercial interruptions.  My only disappointment was that the writer's strike limited the number of episodes available in this set.
1592402038|4.0|Who ever would have thought punctuation could be so funny (or controversial)?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and I'm glad I read it. It surprised me how much I know about punctuation; where did I learn that? I'm certain I was absent most of high school. I did learn a thing or two (like the difference between who's and whose ... who knew?) But I think the tricky areas of punctuation will still remain tricky for me. Also, I'm an abuser of the eplipsis, and will probably stay that way.<br /><br />Truss's sense of humor is quite keen; the humor alone made the book worth reading.<br /><br />Plus, my new-found understanding of the semi-colon ....<br /><br />(p.s. semi-colons seem a bit pretentious, don't they?)
