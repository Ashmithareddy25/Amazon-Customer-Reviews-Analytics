B00008H2LB|5.0|I absolutely love this album, and I listen to it almost all the time.  If you're wondering whether or not to buy it, then I have some advice for you: BUY IT!  People may think it's short, but I thought that the length was fine.  The songs are awesome, just like the ones in &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;.  In this album Linkin Park all these different elements into the songs, and it gives it a great sound.  Buy it and listen to it to see for yourself!
B00008I8IF|4.0|My first taste of this fantastic band was &quot;Blue&quot; back in the mid-90s when it was their only song getting airplay.  I bought &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot;, and then each subsequent disc as well as the few before it.  I now own the lot. <br />What I love about this band is the sheer talent its members have brought to each CD, even though I have not liked them all equally well.  I like my Jayhawks with a taste of country, a dash of pop, and a dollop of melancholy--when they aren't rocking the house, as they did during their appearance in Louisville a few summers back--the best live music I have ever experienced, bar none.<br />&quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; is a tilt back towards the group's country roots, with the latter few songs a bit too much country for me (as was &quot;Blue Earth&quot; back in 1989).  But &quot;Stumbling Through the Dark&quot; (can you hear the Byrds?), &quot;Tailspin&quot;, &quot;Save It For A Rainy Day&quot;,  &quot;The Eyes of Sarah Jane&quot;, and &quot;One Man's Problem&quot; are every bit as good as any of the Jayhawks classics from &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; or &quot;TTGG&quot;.<br />In short, if you have enjoyed any Jayhawks in the past, buy this CD.  There is something here for everyone, with musicianship and songwriting that is world class even when the songs themselves don't quite fall into your favorite &quot;genre&quot; category.  These guys are simply superb.
B00006RINF|5.0|I am a predominately hip hop/r&b/Alternative listener and I overheard the song \\"swamped\\" and I loved it.  I borrowed the album and I have yet to stop listening to it.  I went and bought a copy and I've been to 2 shows.  They are Awesome!!!  I can honestly say that If I was on a deserted Island with only one album for the rest of my life it would be COMALIES!!!
B00006RCNW|5.0|this is the best show ive seen on tv in a long time!! every episode keeps you watching until the very end. i would recommend this to anybody, especially if you enjoy shows like nypd blue and law and order!!
B00006AFUR|5.0|if you love tool or orgy you will glorify this band, they have an incredibly original sound, and jared leto is just amazing on vocals, if you are pondering on wether or not you should buy this, ponder no more, you will not be disappointed, unless you have no taste in good music what so ever.
B000001IQH|5.0|When I first listened to Rancid's self-titled cd, it was way too hardcore for me and I wrote them off.  On their next cd, they weren't as hardcore and even scored a video on MTV with &quot;Salvation&quot;.  Then came &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;.  Wow.  It blew me away.  Every song on this cd is great.  If you want a comparision, I liken this to the Clash's &quot;London Calling&quot;.  It's not the groundbreaking cd that &quot;London Calling&quot; was, but the variety of music is great.  Tim Armstrong has a great &quot;Strummer-like&quot; voice.  <br />If you like this cd and don't have the Clash's &quot;London Calling&quot; you need to get that cd as well.  It's one of the greatest punk/rock cd's ever created.
0783110871|4.0|This is a pretty good movie. Ray Liotta is totally over the top and Lauren Holly is not that good. The action is not that bad it kinda cool. But if you want a good air disaster film see &quot;Air Force One&quot; and stay away from &quot;Turbulences&quot; two sequels: &quot;Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying&quot; and &quot;Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal&quot; The 1st is enough!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is the best selling album of all time, and its reeditioning is nothing short of incredible, this is Mr. Jackson's greatest album, and one of my personal favourites<BR>1. Wanna be startin' somethin': An amazing track which I love, and which I always listen to<BR>2. Baby be mine:  a wonderful song probably few peole see to its full extent, I personally love this softish song<BR>3. The girl is mine: A wonderful song, and a great duet.<BR>4. Thriller: An amazing song, which I love, specially the rap by Vincent Price, a wonderful rythmn and beat<BR>5. Beat it: Great rock and roll and great song<BR>6.

0316666343|1.0|I was sold by the back of the book comparing this to 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  Whoever wrote that review has obviously not read the Harper Lee book.  This is the only book I remember reading half of and putting it down and never picking it up again.  I just couldn't get into the story or relate to any of it's characters.<br />Everyone is different and no doubt millions will love this book, but it certainly wasn't for me.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is the best Cd ever made! Dude Ranch, Cheshire Cat, and Take off are all outstanding albums. However, Enema of the State is much better!...The songs are high-quality work!<br />Dumpweed: 10/10 A mind-boggling song. Outstanding guitar riffs!<BR>Don't Leave me: 8.5/10 A good song, not the best.<BR>Aliens Exist: 10/10 Probably Tom's favorite song (his obsession with aliens)<BR>Going away to College: 9/10 Great Song!<BR>What's my age Again: 9.5/10 Fantastic song!<BR>Dysentery Gary: Best song ever Made!

B00005QY5Y|4.0|Overall a highly enjoyable CD. Adams' singing is as always raw and emotional, without being overdone, but I fear the music lags behind at times. &quot;Nobody Girl&quot; is a terrific song - but it's five minutes too long. I think Adams was trying too hard to live up to his new reputation as a critical darling when he cut this track at roughly eight minutes. Someone needs to tell him it's ok to write a three minute pop or country song - you can still stir people's hearts and minds. Ditto for &quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues:&quot; Adams is trying to be someone he's not, here. He's more Neil Young than Bruce Springsteen, but he goes in the wrong direction here; the backing vocals have a Tina Turner vibe, and they don't belong on this record.<br />&quot;New York, New York,&quot; &quot;Firecracker,&quot; &quot;Sylvia Plath,&quot; &quot;Harder Now That It's Over,&quot; and the final track, the &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Blvd.&quot; showcase Adams' strengths: he writes exeptionally good, straightforward and accessible rock songs about love and life. His combination of energetic rock and slow, rolling ballads is refreshing, enjoyable, and completely unpretentious.<br />While more polished or produced than his previous work or live performance, still recommended listening for fans of Ryan Adams' (considerable) musical and lyrical abilities.
6302902010|5.0|I remember seeing this movie with Sidney Portier and Sammy Davis Jr. I enjoyed it very much and all my children were rocked to sleep to 'Summertime'. It ain't necessarily so, was probably sung no where else in town except in my house. I'd like to be able to get THAT movie.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This movie is a favorite of mine, though I do not give it the five star rating, because it is not perfect by any means.  I read this book and the books that followed because of this movie.  While it does not follow the book exactly (the whole thing with Louis's brother, Lestat's father, Lestat in Paris) it does an excellent job.  There are lots of little things that make me truly love this movie that Queen of the Damned forgot about.  There is the part where Louis is sitting staring into the candle while Lestat throws grapes at him, out of the entire movie this scene is probably the best when it comes to showing the relationship between these characters.  There is also the part where Louis is burning down the house and Lestat breaks through the window and they fight to which Lestat responds \\"Shut up, Louis!\\"<br />Claudia is amazing.  While in the books she is younger than six, here she is about 12, but the fact is you could never find a six year old child with that type of range.  Her performance is amazing and truly portrays Claudia as the amazing and disturbing character she is.<br />Armand is the most disappointing, while Antonio takes a noble stab, his appearances is almost the total opposite of Armand.  Armand is short, has auburn hair, and is very young being about 16 or 17.<br />Christian Slater does an excellent job as Daniel Molloy (the reporter).  The end, however, is a tad bit aggravating to those fans of the book. Needless to say, there is no part in the car with Lestat. (I will admit, this is a part I enjoy, but far from the book.)<br />Many of the women I know who enjoy this movie are in it mainly for the top stars and any excuse to watch them.  If you are watching it for this reason you may be disappointed as both are in quite a good deal of make-up, which may or may not add to your appreciation of their looks.  If you are coming in strictly with a huge love for the books you might also be disappointed.  Things as I have mentioned have been changed orcut entirely.  However, if you come into this movie strictly because you want to watch a good vampire movie than this is a good one for you.  While not the typical vampire action movie (if you are looking for that, watch Blade) it is more thinking and gives a better idea of what it might actually be like to live as a vampire.  If you are looking for more fun, less thought, and wild music watch Queen of the Damned.  What you think of this movie is all a matter of what you are looking for.  <br />This movie is unashamedly dark.  If you are not a fan of dark and depressing movies do NOT see this because you will not enjoy it.  However, if you have an appreciation for the dark things of life and story lines this is probably the movie for you.<br />(This is my first review of anything, so be kind!)
B00005A46T|3.0|Though I dont ordinaraly listen to 'nu metal' I just couldnt ignore all the hype about these guys.  I found this album mildly entertaining, the energy is incredible, but there is a lack of quallity tracks on this album.  Not true metal, but not bad...
B000002J1F|5.0|Unlike many of the other reviewers, I am a very new Yes listener, even though I am in my mid 30s. Last summer a friend of mine called me up because he had been given 2 tickets to a yes concert in St Louis, and had noone to go with him. I think the only Yes song I knew was &quot;Roundabout&quot;, but having nothing to do that night, I went along. Listening to the radio station that was promoting the concert that afternoon, I also learned that the band's lineup was more or less the &quot;classic&quot; lineup with the return of Rick Wakeman on keyboards. I listened to a brief history of the band, with their ups and downs and almost constant lineup changes. I began to get interested in finding out more. Then the concert started at 8 o'clock. I was totally blown away by the musicianship of these five fiftysomething rock musicians. They opened the concert with Heart of the Sunrise, and I was immediately hooked. The next day I ordered Fragile, and just about wore out the CD playing it. I discovered how much I liked and appreciated YES and other progressive rock. It was a bit of a revelation to me because I did not realize that there were rock bands out there making this kind of music. Progressive rock isn't &quot;cool&quot; with the youth of the 90s and 00s, so I guess it just never gets played on the radio. Since that concert a year ago I have gone on to listen to many of Yes' albums and have been thoroughly impressed. Will you like Yes?  You will if you appreciate great musicianship and epic songs with outstanding instrumental sections. If all you want to listen to is the 3 minute offerings of cookie cutter top 40 artists or the insipid repetitive meaningless beat of rap, Yes is not for you. But if you are looking for something a little more complex and deeper, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This should have won \\"Best Picture\\" of 2002 or 2003 for that matter! Daniel Day Lewis was brilliant,the scene with him telling the police commissner of a dead rabbit hanging on a fence stays with me to this day, I mean how would you make a dead rabbit on a fence sound intriging? Well, you would do it the way Danial Day Lewis does it. Martin Scorsese can tell a story better then most men and his directing is even better! If you missed the movie when it was released, then buy the DVD, if you saw the movie, buy the DVD. I have been waiting like a kid for Christmas waiting for this movie, it's kind of nice to have Christmas in July
B000002LN9|4.0|This is an excellent compilation taken from 24 night run at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1990.  This is a great CD for hardcore Clapton fans or for the unfamiliar music lover.  The sound quality is top notch and the whole band is in fine form.<br />Disc one- Badge is a great opener with a cathcy little piano riff that will bring a smile to your face and get your head boppin.  White Room and Sunshine kick as usual although a little more soloing from Clapton and few other insturments would of been appreciated.  A fun Watch Yourself and interesting Edge round out an overall solid disc that you will leave in your player for a long while <br />Disc two- Pretending is my favorite song on the whole album and this song prooves that Clapton hasn't lost contrary to what some of his fans think.  He still has the ability and the drive/energy, he just displays less often which is a little unfortuante.  Both Bad and Old Love are good follow ups and the rest finish suit nicely.<br />Bottom Line: a great two disc set.  If you are new to Clapton than go with Crossroads 2 instead but if you don't want shell out a 50 than you might want to consider 24 nights although there are decent Clapton offerings for the rookies that might be better.
B00005JMC6|5.0|In line with \\"Bend It like Beckham\\" and \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\", brilliant works about girls of color in the Anglophone diaspora are being made that are worth every ounce of praise they receive.  This film has broad-based appeal because every woman or girl who has ever been told she is not worthy due to her gender will relate to the main character here.  Further, tomboys and sensitive guys will relate to the main character's tribulations over \\"not acting right\\" again based on rigid societal restrictions.  Interestingly, this movie says nothing about the white or \\"Pakeha\\" New Zealanders.  In the US, there is no film besides \\"Smoke Signals\\" where Native Americans just deal with each other.  Natives are almost always only portrayed dealing with white colonial contacts.  \\"Whale Rider\\" recognizes that indigenous people have interesting stories to tell outside of their contact with non-Natives.  This film made New Zealand look as beautiful as everyone says it is.  After seeing this movie, \\"Once Were Warriors,\\" \\"Utu\\", and even the Maoris in \\"Star Wars II,\\"  I totally wish I could see more films with Maoris or read more books about Maori culture.  I welcome any recommendations from amazon readers.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Even though they're very different bands, Wilco has done something The Strokes could not. Wilco made a hyped CD, and has lived up to all the adulation it received. While I am very far from a scholarly music fan (though I often pretend to be one), and thus do not own 200+ CD's and cannot make intellectual insights about music, I still say that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of the best CD's I have ever had the pleasure of listening to.<BR>     Initially, however, I was not very impressed with YHF. I had been wooed by the catchy, pop-flavors of Summerteeth, and found Yankee Hotel Foxtrot a difficult listen. The tunes didn't possess the instant appeal of Summerteeh songs such as \\"Shot in the Arm,\\" \\"Candyfloss,\\" \\"Summerteeth,\\" or \\"I'm always in Love.\\" They weren't something I could throw in my CD player and listen to while I made my bed or did the other daily drudgery about my house. The songs from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot required me to sit down and \\"listen\\" to the music in order to appreciate their greatness. Of course, initially I was impatient. I felt I didn't have the time to sit at my desk, headphones on, lyric book open, taking in all the sounds and moods of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. However, as time grew on, and the strenuous workload of AP classes was assuaged, I found myself willing and able to sit down and really listen to the music. And as time grew, I realized what a wonderful CD I had in my possession. <BR>     The first track, \\"I am trying to Break Your Heart\\" is a slow-but-complex song about love, loss, and regret. What makes this track so wonderful are the electronical \\"pings\\" and \\"beeps\\" that softly float about the song, making us feel that we are right on the street with a drunken Tweedy, \\"American Aquarium Drinkers\\" ourselves. The poetic lyrics such as \\"Disposable Dixie Cup Drinker\\" and \\"Bible black pre-dawn\\" show us that Jeff Tweedy (and Jay Bennett?) are not only effective songwriters, but talented lyricists.<BR>     The track, \\"Radio Cure\\" is a relatively slow and slightly brooding song, that redeems a relatively mediocre song with an extremely catchy chorus. However, the real tracks await in the later half of the CD.<BR>     I am still debating as to whether \\"Jesus etc.\\" is the best song on the album. If it's not the best, it certainly comes close. The violin effect, Tweedy's pained, cracking voice, and beautiful lyrics come together to form the perfect amalgam needed for a brilliant song. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is a catchy, light tune with a touch of melancholy (\\"I miss the innocence I've known/ Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned...\\"). <BR>     The last two tracks of the album make it shine, with the poetic \\"Poor Places,\\" and the heartbreaking \\"Reservations.\\" The endings of both songs also are filled with strange sound effects played ever so subtly that one must really keep a keen ear in order to here them (much less make out what they are).<BR>     I've gone on long enough. In closing, I would like to say that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an absolutely brilliant CD that has lived up to it's hype completely, and it's greatness should not be ignored. This CD is a proverbial \\"diamond in the rough\\"; a wonderful CD full of great music in a desert of commercialism, mediocre songs, and repetition. I am begging you to buy it. You will be pleasantly surprised.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The characters, the lines, the music. I love this show. Non-stop laughs. I'll list some key parts of the movie to let you know if the comedy is your flavor.<BR>-mentions a porno movie named \\"Log Jammin'\\" and shows a clip from it(yes it has wah-wah guitar).<BR>-a Hispanic pedophile bowler (and snappy dresser) named Jesus.<BR>-\\"this is what happens when you f**k another man in the a**, Larry.\\"<BR>-\\"shut the f**k up Donnie.\\"<BR>-\\"Let me tell you something, bendeco. You pull any of your crazy s**t with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away form you and stick it up your a** and pull the f**ning trigger til it goes click\\".<BR>The people who gave this movie 1 star are either Carrot Top fans or they didn't watch the movie. I've seen it probably 10 times. I don't normally watch movies more than once. It gets funnier and funnier every time.  Very gratuitous use of the \\"F\\" word.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I don't think it's possible to truthfully say anything bad about Andrew W.K. As stated many times before, he is quite possibly the savior of rock and roll. This album is completely different in that it screams in the face of everything that is wrong with rock music today, all with a simple message: to party-- hard. Andrew W.K. is a band for everyone. Just because it is devoid of \\"deep meanings\\" doesn't mean it can't kick [booty]. It's more wholesome than most bands out there today, while still rocking your socks off. Just for that, it rises above anything else modern rock has to offer.
B00004W52U|5.0|Scroll through the 50+ reviews and see that almsot everyone has given this five stars. why read another review? I have no answer for that.<BR>I got this Cd because I heard the majority of these tunes whilst seeing the H-street crew tear up the streets. Matt Hensley in particular carving a fullpipe and lipsliding the edge to the unequalled mind fusing power of 'knowledge'. At 15 I was so stoaked on these songs that I recorded the 5 or 6 on offer stright off the TV. I kept the tape until this year (at 27) when I got the CD. <BR>Take Warning...Take Warning!
B00005MP58|5.0|The book was a great commentary on British society, well written and entertaining. This film version of the novel is this as well as a lush epic of the relationship between two people separated by their standing in society but brought together by love in the end. <BR>The casting was fabulous - each character is brilliant in their role. The best and worst of each family member is displayed. A father who loves his family but is careless in taking care of them. A mother who loves her daughters but whose dramatic personality causes endless embarrassments. One serious, beautiful sister, another (Jennifer Ehle) not as serious and not as beautiful, and two younger sisters who are young and silly. Colin Firth is exceptional as Darcy. He is cold, contemptuous and haughty but every now and then we see a look or expression that shows us Darcy's inner character. Jennifer Ehle is also fabulous as she makes Elizabeth fun, intelligent and caring. <BR>I've seen this movie many times on A&E and finally broke down and bought the DVD's. What was fabulous to see were several scenes that didn't make it to air on A&E - it was a great treat!
6305265488|5.0|I have watched this movie many times.  I has everything except it should be much longer.  I classify the movie as drama although some parts are funny.  At times you will be angry at the treatment of Danielle (Cinderella)from her stepmother, sister, and even the Prince.  However, justice prevails and the ending leaves you feeling good.
B00000K31Q|5.0|While it is Shakespeare (one big reason why I love it so much), it is also a great family movie.  Its modern, funny, has a great soundtrack and wonderful actors.  <BR>In the newest version of The Taming of the Shrew by the great Bard, we see Kat as a high school student.  She is rebelling against her circumstances - a mother who abandoned the family, an over-protective father, a guy who used and dumped her.  Patrick, another original character, is paid to date Kat so Kat's little sister (Bianca) can also start to date.  And, of course, in a wild twist of events Kat finds what Patrick is doing.  Only now he has begun to really like her.  But she hates him now.  Meanwhile, Bianca is also having her own romantic troubles.<BR>Definitely worth the watch, this is good for adults and kids!  And who knows, it might just make a Shakespeare fan of you!
B00008PX8P|2.0|I still remember the day in high school when Paul Warhoff started raving about the new Yardbirds, or Led Zeppelin.  He absolutely loved Jimmy Page.  An excellent guitarist, Paul learned and played every Page song perfectly by summer.  Another friend, Craig Phillips, also played guitar and Page.  Summers were fantastic; surf all day and go to the Frost house(it was kind of a Brady Bunch family of hippy teenagers) to rock out with Zeppelin every afternoon and night.  So, naturally, disappointed with the &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; I jumped at the chance to see more, and, perhaps, better Zeppelin.  Sadly, it isn't the case.  The band plays too loud, too sloppy, and the rhythms that blast off on record are lost.  I got bored watching this thing, and I turned it off.  It does have moments.  Zeppelin will always be one of my favorite bands, but this DVD is not worth the money.
0385509456|5.0|Some books you read and enjoy because they keep you entertained while you are reading them, but then you put them back on the shelf and essentially forget them.  More rarely, you read a book that stays with you long after you have finished it.  This book is one of those rare ones, and it is one of the best novels I have read in months or even years.  If you are hesitating to buy it because you aren't interested in autism, I would encourage you to try it anyway.  The narration by an autistic teenager does indeed give the book a unique perspective, but it is by no means only a \\"book about autism.\\"  Instead, the novel grapples with themes relevant to anybody's life, such as love, family duty, betrayal, and trust.<br />Having said that, I will acknowledge that the author has accomplished a tremendous writing feat in adopting the perspective of a boy with autism, and I admire his writing style enormously.  Somehow he is able to evoke strong emotional reactions in the reader while narrating events in a dispassionate, \\"just the facts\\" style devoid of any affect: Christopher writes of his mother's death in exactly the same tone as he does the death of a neighbor's dog. Yet somehow this style works--when Christopher notes that \\"there were tears running down Father's face,\\" the reader knows that this calm observation has no emotional impact for Christopher, but the reader grasps the context and feels like crying, too.<br />Another aspect of this novel I admired greatly is that Haddon does not romanticize or sugarcoat the world of special needs individuals.  According to the biographical material, Haddon has been a teacher of students with developmental disorders, and his description of the abilities and traits of a teenager with autism ring true.  Unlike most Hollywood portrayals of autism (think \\"Rainman,\\" which was exceedingly unrealistic), the character of Christopher displays not only the unique gifts but also the tremendous parenting challenges associated with autism.  He is a math whiz, but he also frequently wets himself, and when he is overwhelmed in public places, he groans or screams until taken away. While there is no tidy happy ending to this story --like any autistic person, Christopher will not experience a miraculous \\"cure\\"-- the reader nonetheless ends up with a sincere admiration for Chistopher's strength and courage, as well as that of Christopher's family.e is a math whiz, but he also frequently wets himself, and when he is overwhelmed in public places, he groans or screams until taken away.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is amazing! It is like watching a Zep concert from the best seat in the house. Some of the video footage isn't top quality because in a review in Guitar One magazine Jimmy Page told the magazine that they included bootleg footage alongside the official footage. My two favorite songs are the extended version of Dazed and Confused and Moby Dick. Jimmy Page and John Bohnam are extremely talented. Get this DVD
B00000J2PH|5.0|I was 14 years old when \\"Tapestry\\" was released.  \\"It's Too Late\\" was the  song given air time by radio stations who then discovered, as did everyone else ,that almost every \\"cut\\"  on this album was a hit. Everyone I knew at that time either owned a copy of \\"Tapestry\\" or wanted to.  In the years since, I have talked to many other people my age and older who felt the same way. Carole King wrote many hits for others, a few she performs herself on this album. \\"Natural Woman\\" and \\"Will You Still Love Me Tommorrow?\\" were songs written by King and made into huge hits by other people.     Not to take away from those people, especially Aretha, I still prefer Carole King's versions.  I have always considered \\"Tapestry\\" to be one of the very few \\"perfect\\" albums released.  I am not a music critic or can I truly explain what I mean by saying \\"a perfect album\\". I can only say that it is one of the very few albums I have heard that made me wonder how the artist could possibly follow it with anything as good in the future.  Maybe \\"classic\\" is a better word. The fact that this album was released at the time when other artists such as Elton John, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, etc. were just beginning their careers makes this quite an accomplishment in my eyes.  I would believe that the music is so special to me because it was part of \\"my time\\". I have found this  not be so.  A song from \\"Tapestry\\" titled \\"Where You Lead\\" is used during the opening of the TV show \\"Gilmore Girls\\". I have a 7 year old daughter who is too young to stay up late enough to watch this show, but insists on seeing the opening only to hear this song. While I like many kinds of music, I am delighted that we can share \\"our\\" music with our kids and have them enjoy it also. Whether you grew up with the music from this  album or are hearing it for the first time, it is truly one of the best  .

I read it in two days - couldn't put it down!  I also found it interesting because so many real-life things are mentioned - paintings by Great Masters and famous churches, whose pictures I could look up on the Internet and see more clearly what was described in the book.

I was pleasantly surprised to find accurate and informative information within the confines of a work of fiction.  This book will teach the reader all they never knew about our history, and perhaps give a new perspective!
B00008LOS1|4.0|Once again, MCA re-releases &quot;Who's Next&quot;, and once again, MCA misses the opportunity to finally put out the 'definitive' &quot;Who's Next&quot; compilation.<br />Much like the 1995 re-release, the 'bonus tracks' are a major disappointment to say the least. The accompanying booklet goes into great depth discussing the additional songs recorded during the 'Lifehouse Sessions' that were omitted, so then why aren't any of them included here? Where's &quot;Let's See Action&quot;, &quot;Join Together&quot;, &quot;Put The Money Down&quot;, &quot;Time Is Passing&quot;, &quot;Too Much Of Anything&quot;, and the definitive take of &quot;Pure And Easy&quot; (from the obscure 'Odds and Sods')?<br />Instead the consumer is treated to mostly redundant 'alternate take' versions of songs already included on &quot;Who's Next&quot;. They might be interesting to hear once or twice, but the 'bonus track' space would have been much better served by including the titles listed above...and would have once and for all reconstructed &quot;Who's Next&quot; close to the original &quot;Lifehouse&quot; as was originally designed.<br />However, if you're a fan of The Who &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; and &quot;Live At The Isle Of Wight&quot;, the second disk is a real treat. The sound quality is excellent, The Who play great, and you get rare 'live' renditions of songs from &quot;Who's Next&quot; that don't show up anywhere else.  Disk 2 is reason enough to purchase this set.<br />Who knows (no pun intended), perhaps there will be yet another re-release of this classic album. And maybe next time it will include the missing 'Lifehouse' songs. For now, disk 2 will have to do as compensation. lr**<br />June 22, 2003<br />Seattle,WA
0316666343|5.0|To find all the right words to describe this book would be near impossible.  Eloquently written, it tells of Susie Salmon, who is brutally raped and murdered.  She follows the lives of her friends and family, along with her cruel murderer, trying to send signals and find peace with her death.  Everyone should read this book and experience the emotions it creates.
B00005B36H|3.0|This is a pretty neat album, one for music lovers of the world.  Tool have a pretty keen musical sense, too; I wish them luck in the future!!!
0385504209|5.0|I began reading this book at 10am on a Sunday morning, and did not put it down until I was done at 10pm that night.  A 'page turner' hardly begins to describe this story.  As an avid student of the Old Religion and how it was incorporated into today's modern religions, this book enthralled me.<br />The characters are full, and each one is developed to where you don't feel like you were cheated from knowing them.  It's fast paced but yet easy to follow.  I borrowed this book from a friend, but I'm definately going to buy it so I can read it again and catch anything that I may have missed the first time around!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Yes, I have heard it all regarding John Mayer and his &quot;similarities&quot; to Dave Matthews...  &quot;Dave Matthews Lite&quot;, &quot;Son of Dave&quot;, etc....  I am a very big Dave fan and a John Mayer fan.  Here's what I think:  Night and Day.  So they both have bands and they play acoustic guitars.  That's where the similarity ends.  <br />John Mayer has a very unique ability to paint pictures of his thoughts.  As I listen to his lyrics, I see what he says; clearer than any other artist has ever been able to do for me.  Along with that, his voice is soothing and his guitar playing is by far the BEST of anyone out there today. The album may not demonstrate that skill as well as his live performances, but this CD is a &quot;must-have&quot; for anyone who enjoys a CD that can be played from beginning to end.  And when I say I have played this CD over and over, every day (minus a few around Christmas), I'm not lying.
B00005MP58|5.0|The BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is one of the finest adaptations of any written work I have ever seen.  Wherever possible, the original language from the novel was used, which gives the film an authentic aura that adds considerably to its appeal. The casting was quite good, as even minor characters were fleshed out in a believable, entertaining, and true-to-the-book manner. Even the BBC's minor additions to the story (such as Mr. Darcy venting his romantic frustrations in a fencing lesson) are in the spirit of the novel.  I have to say that Colin Firth nailed the part of Darcy. I can't imagine anyone having the nerve to play Mr. Darcy again, as his performance is so keenly in tune to the literary character--so enigmatic and aloof yet strangely charismatic--that anyone who makes another attempt will surely be put to shame. I especially love his abrupt entrances and exits, they say so much about Darcy without his having to actually speak. (And oh his eyes! don't get me started...) This is a great movie that I would watch again and again (in fact I do, while simultaneously reading the book. I might add that I'm beginning to talk like them sometimes...:)
0156012197|5.0|The little prince is a translated version of la petit prince or the french oringinal version. Even though it says it is for younger kids I absolutly love the book to death. There are a few things to know about the author before you read this book. The author is the character telling the story in the book. He was in real life a polit  and he crashes in the sahara desert in the book where he meets the little prince. Its a great story for all ages young or elderly! But the best part is that a year later (in his real life) on a mission in the sahara desert (he was a polit for the navy/milatary) he couldn't fly because of injuries from former crashes. But he begged so he flew over the Sahara desert and was never seen again. So did he crash on purpose to follow the book or did it just happen by quensidence?
1565847032|5.0|Editors Peter Mitchell and John Schoeffel have done an incredible job. Taking material from dozens of talks given by Chomsky throughout the 1990's, they have put together a highly readable compendium of its author's wide-ranging interests. Moreover, they have meticulously footnoted the text, citing plenty of sources and thus giving the book the academic rigour that most interview volumes usually lack (the footnotes are available for free at [website]). Whether you are new to Chomsky's ideas, or and old fan of the man who the New York Times calls \\"arguably the most important intellectual alive\\", _Understanding_Power_ is definetely a must have.
0790729628|3.0|I was mesmerized by this film when I saw it in its original theatrical release.  The visuals -- though not &quot;spectacular&quot; by today's standards -- are still immensely impactful in their tone.  The story is very intelligent and still compelling.  <br />After hearing much about the director's cut, I was momentarily persuaded into thinking that Harrison Ford's voiceover was indeed corny and superfluous.  Well, I saw the movie again a few days ago (in the Director's Cut), and I have to disagree.  The voiceover narration that's present in the original version helps move the pace along.  A lot.  And there are specific key scenes where the narration adds a lot more depth than if it wasn't there.  To me the wisdom of the pivotal climactic scene, and how it is comprehended by Deckart is what sets this film apart from anything like it.  As it is now, he just gets a funny, knowing look, and then it cuts to the conclusion.  The full meaning of Roy Batty's actions are quickly overlooked, given the momentum of the scenes that preceded his speech.  You need that bit of self reflection along with the smirk, Harrison.<br />Yes, I know it's still film noir without the voiceover, but this movie needs it.  I want the original version on DVD, too.  And this makes it the second movie I've seen where the Director's Cut hasn't lived up to the hype.  3 stars for this version.  5 stars for the movie in general.
0385504209|2.0|While The Da Vinci Code IS a page-turner and the premise seems promising, even fascinating, this book is really just a beach or airplane novel disguised as high art. The mingling of some fact with a lot of fiction will leave most with more questions than answers, or worse the belief that much of what Brown passes off as legitimate undisputed theology is actually the truth. If you're still interested in reading it, the good news is that you can do it in an evening or two and move onto something better!<br />PS I completely agree with the reviewer who complained about the publisher's review spoiler; many reader reviewers do this as well and I, too, think Amazon should effect a policy against this practice.
B00008LDPU|5.0|These 9 shorts are excellent background material for the Matrix movies. Some of them are very important, if one wants to fully understand reloaded, as they tell the stories that were only briefly mentioned, and also let you know who that annoying kid was that greeted them when they first got to zion.<br />The animation is first-rate, done by some of the top anime houses around. If you think animation is for children, then you definitely need to see this to show you what the medium can do for a story.<br />An excellent set of stories, pay attention to the ratings, there is as much violence in these as there are in the movies.
B00008O0WN|2.0|After watching this film I went back and watched First Contact and was amazed by how much more energy and snappy dialog it had.  To me this film felt full of plot holes and was tired.  Tired especially in its use of old formulae:  a threat to Earth, an outgunned Enterprise (they sure did better against the Borg!), the insipid weepiness of Deanna Troi, an alien device for Picard to figure out and defuse before it goes off (has anyone kept track of how many times he has done this?), the inability of the crew--Data this time, in the wedding scene--to quit singing and dancing and get off Broadway altogether...<br />And some parts were just silly.  The pronged metal thing that just happened to be on the Scimitar's bridge for Picard to use against his alter ego.  Another android, seemingly out of nowhere, found by chance in time for an insidious agenda.  Half the crew departing without even a heartfelt goodbye.  And a dune buggy with a phaser rifle and big tires:  this is the best the 24th Century can do in terms of new equipment?  Did Starfleet HQ move to Baja?<br />The film did have its strong points.  The bad guy could be whiny but was eloquent in places.  The exploration of cloning and individuality was timely, if limited.  Patrick Stewart is great in just about everything he appears in, even if he did scream too much in Moby Dick.  Same with Brent Spiner.<br />I've been watching STNG since its inception, and if this is indeed the last film, then perhaps it needs to be, although a more dramatically crafted finale--like \\"All Good Things\\"--would have let the show depart the stage with a bang rather than a whimper.  After watching the film twice I told myself that perhaps a lack of closure said something essential and good about the series itself.  But in the end, I didn't believe it.
0312979479|4.0|Christie begins with a not-anything-special-but-it's-good sort of story line. Nothing an avid reader hasn't seen before. (I imagine Ellen Raskin got the idea of the Westing Game from this story). We are introduced to Indian Island, once owned by an American millionaire (yes, the story is British), who has sold his estate-on-the-island-- it's the hit of the news, and everyone wants to be there. Problem?--nobody knows exactly who has bought it. Rumors are flying and facts are few.<br />In the meantime, 10 different people, all with various backgrounds are contacted in various ways, none connected directly with the new owner of Indian Island. Reluctantly and happily and angrilly, our guests come to the island and get to know each other during the boat ride. The shock comes after they arrive. It seems that Mr. Owens, the supposed owner of the estate, has not arrived. In fact, it does seem that he does not arrive for the entire duration of their stay!<br />The guests are surprised, but carry on normally, some planning to go back home on the morrow, when the boat comes to the island. When the guests go to their rooms, they see a plaque on the hearth, the grotesque poem of the Indian boys (10, then 9, then 8, and etc, all dying in grotesque ways). They think nothing of this, some even fond of the old rhyme they knew as chidlren. Nor do they think anything strange of the 10 Indian figures placed on the dining table.<br />The real shock comes when suddenly, during a quiet time, a recording booms aloud, stating each of our tenants, and a murder(s) they have committed. Naturally this angers/confuses/arouses suspicion/guilt from our tenants, and they demand explanations. It doesn't help when a guest dies, then another, then another, then another.....all like the ways described in the grotesque poem on the plaque.<br />After the third or fourth death, the remaining guests decide that the murderer (they came to the conclusion that it was a murder), was one of them!!<br />The conclusion is awesome, bringing you to the edge of your chair, with suspense ringing in the air. I can almost guarantee you will be shocked.<br />Can you find the murderer before it's too late?nclusion is awesome, bringing you to the edge of your chair, with suspense ringing in the air. I can almost guarantee you will be shocked. <br />Can you find the murderer before it's too late?
078322608X|5.0|What makes this film so great is in the details.  The cartoons that comes on in the background.  The ingenious meshing of Hitchcock dialog in the theater scene.  Just to mention a very few.  And the intelligent premise that someone actually coming to us from the future would very likely be treated as insane and institutionalized in our present, rather than hailed as a hero.<br />I always considered Brad Pitt as a just a &quot;face,&quot; but this movie proves otherwise.  His performance eclipses that of Bruce Willis, even though this is considered the start of Willis' more serious acting endeavors.<br />Worth mentioning:  Included in the DVD, there's a significant documentary entitled &quot;The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys.&quot;  It's more than the usual &quot;Making Of. . .&quot; press-kit documentaries that are thrown in with other movie DVD's, and worth watching/sitting-through.  It shows the agonizing process of film making in general, even for someone like Gilliam.
B00005QIPH|5.0|A simple, straightforward C.D.  You can slip this one into your player and enjoy from start to finish.  If you're into Iggy Pop, The Ramones or New York Dolls, you will enjoy this c.d.  It isn't the most original album in the world, but the music kicks butt and that, after all, is the most important thing.  Try it, it's great at a party!!!  So just enjoy it.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Okay, I saw the movie before reading the book. Loved the movie so much that I ran out to get the book only to find that the plot-lines went down separate paths right after the second page. Sure, there are similarities, and the fact is, both the movie and the book are excellent. As long as you don't try to make one follow the other.<br />I am glad that I bought the DVD, this is an excellent movie. It is fun to watch it over again. The sound on this movie is one of the best edits ever.
B000002N2P|5.0|First of all I would like to start off by saying to all of you ignorant people out there that Green Day is not &quot;pop punk&quot; and they are not &quot;sellouts&quot;.  A real sellout would have changed their music to sell more albums but &quot;Dookie&quot; is the same exact music that Green Day had been playing during their punk days.  They may not be punk, but they aren't pop punk.  Music shouldn't be put into categories like that.  Anyways, about this album, I recommend it to everybody on the entire planet.  It is my personal favorite of all the Green Day CDs.  I also think that this album is the best showcase of how great a lyricist Billie Joe Armstrong is.  The best songs on this album are &quot;Armatage Shanks&quot; &quot;Babs Uvula Who?&quot; &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; and &quot;Stuck With Me&quot;.  I think everyone should get this album, especially Green Day fans.
B00008XEP5|3.0|It's nice the have the original mixes and all, but this has obviously been mastered from damaged tapes. It's particularly apparent on Am I Evil; the high end whooshes up and down like a cassette that was left out in the sun. I'm not crazy about the \\"white album\\" cover \\"art\\", either.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Whatever your personal preference, whatever you think of the Stones then/now, this DVD is a must-own in so many ways.  As a documentary (perhaps the antithesis of Woodstock: The Movie), or as a concert film, Criterion have done a great job in restoring this movie.<br />There are some problems inherent in the source tape, but if the picture (while quite sharp for its age) isn't as good as a million other DVDs out there, it's still much better than its earlier incarnations both on the big screen and later on video.<br />They've included still photographs (no big deal), and a pretty good commentary track, along with a (mostly) complete radio broadcast from KSAN the day after Altamont that's quite interesting.  Some grainy backstage footage of Mick, Ike & Tina Turner, and a restorative featurette showing the difference between the old film and the digital transfer.<br />But the real star of this movie is the sound.  If you've got surround, crank up the volume and enjoy the Stones from the best sounding period in their entire career before decay set in.
B000002NIW|5.0|Deftones, of the best bands out there right now. this album is the best of the best when it comes to nu-metal. Deftones actually do not have class for themselves. they have so much versatility, from the melodic &quot;mascara&quot; to the heavy and raw &quot;headup&quot; to the ear shout screams of chino in &quot;my own summer'. the track realy sticks out in this album has to be &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (far away)&quot;. the song is not as havy as the rest of the album but its very rythmic and it is a great track. its th pinnacle of the record. <BR>All in all, this is an AMAZING record. i highyl recomned it if u wanna know what REAL nu-metal is....
B00008LOS1|5.0|Although I'm mainly a classical and jazz buff, there's still a lot of popular and especially rock music that I like.<br />Like the mythical Phoenix bird, which arose from its own ashes, this album has emerged in several different versions (although how can you improve on perfection?). Pete Townshend has privately released a version of the album based on his ambitious Lifehouse project, and Steve Hoffmann at MCA also issued one. But the original album was the one that shook the rock world and virtually redefined rock 'n roll back in the early 70's.<br />The best thing about this release is the six tracks that weren't included in the original album. Several songs from the live performance at the Young Vic theater were included that didn't make it into the original album. They also claim it's the first time since the original album that the original masters were used, although Steve Hoffmann at MCA also claimed that he used the original masters in his CD, which is still available in Canada. (I was just in Canada recently and forgot to pick it up). :-)<br />Anyway, even if you already have the other albums, this one is still worth picking up for the songs that aren't on any of the other versions. There are some technical details in terms of the sound quality that I won't bore you with, but if you're interested check out Bradley Olson's detailed discussion of these points.
0553573403|5.0|I received the Song of Ice and Fire series as a gift.  I love fantasy books and it is main type I read, but at first glance I wasn't really interested in reading A Game of Thrones.  In my spare time I needed a book to read so I just thought, &quot;what the hell, I'll read the first couple of chapters to see how I like it&quot;.  To my surprise, I didn't put the series down until I completed all three books, and the books became several of my favorites.  The characters are all unique and all equally interesting.  The twists and turns made it unpredictable and kept me captivated. I can hardly wait for A Feast for Crows.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Having only recently seen the orignal cut of this movie, then picking up the Redux version of it, I can't help but rave about the techncal accomplishments, not the mention the superb editing job done on the DVD.<br />None of the addes scenes detract much from the film, and they add a little bit more balance to certain segments--the French Plantation scene being perhaps the most jarring.  I was mostly amazed while watching it that I didn't find the extra length had me looking at my watch.<br />This would actually be a 6-star rating if only they would have included the superb documentary \\"Hearts Of Darkness\\", which is as good as the film itself, really.  It's also missing a commentary track, which is a sin, but Coppola would have his work stand for itself, and thankfully, this is a film that does exactly that.
B000002BE9|5.0|Contrary to the belief of a few of the previous reviewers *glowers* it is obvious to the individual with a discerning ear for music that Apple's first album is a lyrical and melodic masterpiece.  Her lyrics are not &quot;okay&quot;; for anyone who can take a good metaphor, they are poetry in and of themselves.  When coupled with Fiona's haunting, sultry piano pieces, that poetry gains a new dimension.  My personal favourite is &quot;Slow Like Honey&quot;, which embodies the essence of romance and seduction from the perspective of a highly self-confident and strong-willed young woman.  This album is worth its price, I guarantee it.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I was lucky enough to see QUEEN at Madison Square Garden in 1980 and 1982 so I know what they did live. The Wembley Show is 100 times above what I saw. By this time in 1986 QUEEN played to over 8 million people (2 million alone on the 1986 Magic Tour)and Freddie developed and perfected the stadium front man persona. Freddie and the band (Brian, Roger and John) are in fighting trim on this tour. You can tell how each of them know what the next guy is going to do. The corwd sings and participates in every part of the show (Love of My Life, Radio GA GA, Bohemian Rhapsody etc...) Definity worth buying this DVD. The extras are also interesting (rehersals for the Magic Tour, back stage footage etc...) Go and get this DVD
B0000541AM|3.0|Based on seeing &quot;The Warriors&quot; on Joe Bob Briggs' &quot;Monster Vision&quot;, I know for a fact that there is extra/deleted scenes lurking around that need to be restored, or put on as extras. Its disappointing that such an incredible film receives no extras on the DVD edition. This should be looked into.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Regardless of personal preference as to which half of the movie they prefer, the excellence of the first half is enough to earn the majority of the accolades (although the second half is equally well done; it's merely not as interesting).<br />Obviously Lee Ermey is the standout of the film with his portrayal of the sadistic drill instructor, but those early scenes verge on comedy, which only makes the film more effective as a piece of cinematic history.  Not to take anything away from Apocalypse Now, or Deer Hunter, but each film is vastly different from each other, and cannot be rightfully compared in the same way.<br />Like most people, I do prefer the first half of the film, but considering the technical achievement of the second half (reproducing the Vietnam war in London), I have to give even marks all around.<br />Mark this as a 'guy film' par excellence due to its phenomenal screenplay, battle scenes, and testosterone imbalance.  But it's still a keeper for all time, and good for as many repeat viewings as you like.
B000059T1E|5.0|After thirty years, worth another listen. Just fine music, full of intricacies, energy and fusion. Appeals to a broad range of tastes and evokes memories of a simpler time and college life.
B00008DDXL|5.0|I think that this Movie is awesome. I love the story and the plot
1559409002|5.0|This is a really fantastic movie. The tone is very spooky and the cinematography is great, as well as the haunting organ score. What struck me most is that the lead actress, Candace Hilligoss, is a dead ringer for Gwyneth Paltrow; the resemblance is both physical and in her mannerisms. Any Paltrow fans would appreciate seeing this. It's freaky! I am surprised Hilligoss didn't make other movies; she's a great actress and perfect for the role. The abandoned pavilion location (Saltair Resort) is fascinating. The history of the location is as spooky and interesting as the movie itself! I highly recommend this movie for fans of atmospheric scary films.
B000096I9G|3.0|I didn't have any expectations buying this DVD, as a huge Cure fan I would buy it whether it's good or bad anyway. Overall I would rate performances as very uneven and mostly plain. First the music. I agree with earlier comment, the keyboard is off on few songs, but the biggest difference to me is the guitar of Perry Bamonte, or lack of. The Cure just doesn't sound the same without Porl on Pornography and Disintegration sets, so it is up to Robert and Simon to carry the load. Strangely, the riffs still sounded muffed, which might be the effect of trying to level the sound for all the instruments and vocals throughout the DVD. The quality of video is superb, although it would be nice to shoot it in a widescreen format for wider angles especially to capture close-ups. Pornography set suffers from poor video editing where shots are very short and constantly changing, I am guessing caused by flashed of bright lights, contrasting with very dark backdrop. The stage setting, lights, special effects as always nicely complement the music.<BR>As I said at the beginning, buying this DVD I didn't have any expectations, although I always end up discovering something new. So far, after listening to this DVD quite a few times, I haven't stumbled upon it yet, which in a sense, is disappointing.
B000050IE6|5.0|this is one of my favorite cds. the best 2 songs are The Moor and Moonlapse Vertigo.the moor is the better of the two though.<BR>I think that if you just started listening to opeth you should buy still life before any of their others. and overall still life is one of my favorite cds and opeth is one of my favorite bands.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Just when you thought movies based on comic books were preordained to suck, along comes Spider-Man. Helmed by one of my favorite directors in Sam Raimi(whom also wrote and directed the Evil Dead films; check them out), Spider-Man makes for a great movie.<br />Tobey Maguire is genius casting. In the lead role, Maguire lets you empathize and sympathize with Peter Parker, which is missing from many other comic-based films. Willem Dafoe chews up the scenery as Norman Osborn AKA the Green Goblin. He makes for a great adversary. Stuck in the middle are Kirston Dunst(Mary Jane, the main girl in Peter's life) and James Franco(Harry Osborn, son of Norman and Peter's best friend), both of whom provide great supporting parts.<br />What makes Spider-Man succeed, is that the script(Well written by David Koepp) and Raimi's touch take the time to develop the characters and make you actually care about them. (Not too many comic-movies can make that claim) They're layered, so that when they cry, you cry with them. Not that this film is nothing but sappy, there's plenty of action to satisfy popcorn nuts. Some may complain that CGI Spider-Man doesn't look real, but I thought it looked just fine.<br />Everything about this movie is top-notch, and there's only more to love with the DVD, considering the huge load of extras. If you're not a Spidey fan going in, you will be coming out.
0395299179|4.0|This isn't the beautifully told saga of Lord Of The Rings or even the epic, coherent mythology of The Silmarillion.  As the title implies, it's a collection of fragments. Some are remarkably detailed, beautiful narratives of the episodes which were only summarized in the huge history of The Simarillion.  My personal favourites among these are the longer versions of the Lay of Luthien and Beren, and the Song of the Children of Hurin.<br />But the highlight for most will probably be the final scene you'll ever read of Gandalf and the Hobbits, whiling away some time in Minas Tirith after the war of the Ring.  This was intended as an additional chapter of Lord of the Rings, but was finally left out.  It's worth getting the book just to read it.
B000060MMI|5.0|Flogging Molly is the band that got me interested in punk. I wasn't really into it, and my friend was having me listen to a Warped Tour Cd that had &quot;What's Left of the Flag&quot; on it. After I heard that I made him play it again I think 10 or 11 times. I instantly went out and bought this album, and eventually got all three albums and went to a live concert. If you ever get a chance to, these guys are a must live. Best Concert I have ever been to. This album is my personal favorite, and almost every song is fantastic, it's an album that you have no need to push &quot;shuffle&quot; on, just sit back and listen. That is, if you can sit still, it's almost impossible. The music just makes you want to grab a Guiness and pick a fight. If you have an open mind, or enjoy punk or celtic music, this is a must. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!
0156027321|5.0|By any standard, such a masterful telling that it simply renders inconsequential any naive or preconceived notions of &quot;belief&quot; or &quot;disbelief&quot; save for their willing suspension upon entering the circle of wonder. Pi indeed. This man can write and he without fear trods down the taboos and trespasses the zones of any number of those great unthoughts and unsaids that are the bane of contemporary letters. As if thought no longer could move with love or questions with wonder and trust. This is not a sea story though it takes place at sea. This is a living, fearless riposte to the central dogma. It's the finest, most unnervingly alive fiction I've read in the last ten years. The voice is all.  If you could actually love a story between two covers, this might be one.  Read it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Episode 1 pales in comparison to the original trilogy. The CGI is well done, but someone forgot to tell Mr. Lucas that this is a movie, not a video game. The acting is bad. Jake Lloyd as Anakin, really annoyed me. I also can't forget Jar Jar(shudder).<br />The only good things about this movie are 1.) The pod race and 2.) The lightsaber duel at the end.<br />It's only because of the overall DVD package, that this movie got a rating of 3. Without the extras, that would only leave you the movie, itself. Lets just say that Episode 1, by itself, is worth just that, a 1. Thank goodness for DVD.
B000000W5L|5.0|Look, I'm only 15 and this came out long before my time, but it is definately one of my favorite albums...<br />Exile on Main Street was recorded during the summer of 1971 in the basement of a chateau that Keith Richards rented in France.  An unlikely place for the ultimate Stones album to be born.<br />If you get into the right frame of mind, listening to this album is a religious experience.  The sound quality is decidedly low-fi, but for once Mick takes a back seat and his voice becomes just another instrument in the murky mix. This makes the music just sound so great and laid back, but unfortunately at the same time most of the excellent lyrics are rendered unintelligible.<br />There is not a single bad song on this album, which is a lot more than i can say for any albums that come out these days. The more you listen to it all the way through the better it sounds.<br />My favorites off of Exile are \\"Rocks Off\\", \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Sweet Black Angel\\", \\"Torn and Frayed\\", \\"Loving Cup\\", the Keith Richards classic \\"Happy\\", \\"Shine a Light\\", and \\"Soul Survivor\\".  But all the other songs are excellent too.<br />This album was the pinnacle of the Stones' artistry and emotion. Every album they have released since has more or less gotten worse than the one before.  But then again nobody makes records like this anymore, so they should get the credit for at least once being the best band in the world.<br />Play this record enough and it will change your life.
B000096I9G|5.0|The Cure \\"Trilogy\\" DVD is \\"Just Like Heaven\\" for Cure fans! To hear three landmark albums played in their running order and played so well is amazing. Moments frozen in time from three decades. So many of these songs never made it to a traditional tour stage that to hear them now is treat. Interesting too is the older Cure material played by a newer version of the line-up... fascinating.    The performance is straight ahead music... these are my words and they mean something to me! Robert Smith as always is the focal point of the whole concert... and he is older just like the rest of us and a tad heavier too.    The wonderful aspect is that the words, sounds, and songs hold up... the passion and emotion is there on songs 20 years old and songs 2 years old. What a tour de force.    The encore set offers a stand-out rocking performance of \\"The Kiss\\" and just as the show kicks off with a haunting version of \\"100 Years\\", \\"The Kiss\\" sends the viewer/listener on their way with a blow to the mind.... awsome.    There is a glut of Cure music available but if you own more than one Cure CD then  Cure fans you  need this... Older, wiser, better...
B00005JKN9|5.0|DVD (and movies for adults) doesn't get much better than this!  Director and actors at the top of their game and an interesting tale too.  Great costumes, music, etc., AND DVD extras too.  What more could one ask for?
B00008OWZC|5.0|Some bootlegs captured the energy and power of Led Zeppelin, while others sounded good, only to record them on a sloppy night.  This recording, cleaned up and remixed by Jimmy Page, guitarist, main composer, and producer, sounds clear and gorgeous, culled from two nights in Long Beach, at a moment of great creativity.  It shows them &quot;tight, but loose&quot; a description by Page about what he was after.  Along with the amazing DVD, it reestablishes their credentials as perhaps the greatest rock band ever.
B00003CXA3|5.0|This DVD is a great collection of film and features that make it worth buying a DVD player. While you may and seen the movie over and over again, the documentaries that come with the DVD are thrilling as well. One feature lets you listening to the voice over of the director who talks about how he did the scenes while you watches the film. After listening to him, you understand much better all the details included in the film. The second CD has a BBC and a special docu about the background of the  movie. I find it very interesting how careful the interviews with various participants of the film making (producer, director, actors) were cutted. The director Fridkin is a outgoing, very direct character while Hackham is just the opposite of what he played in the film. These docus proof that this was indeed a milestone in filmmaking.
B000084T18|4.0|ok this cd is good, but u gotta kill that radio that u have. they only play 21 questions and in da club and the edits make them sound really stupid.  if u can buy the un-edited, edited music doesn't sound good and you don't know the words.  50 is ok but he mumbles 2 much and is hard 2 understand at times.  y he diss' on other rappers isn't cool, if u need 2 diss on some1 just 2 make music u shouldn't even b in the biz, he's orginal but he'll go pop just like the rest of them over time.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck doesn't let you down. I'll never get tired of his eclectic sound. This album is a bit mellow all the way through, but in no way am I disappointed!
B00005JLF5|3.0|With the sixth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) in production and pre-production for both Star Trek Generations and Star Trek: Voyager in the works, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine somehow made it though all that chaos and on to the (small) screen. <br />DS9's debut is an average one. This first season formally introduces all of the characters, but is too short and the episodes are too verbose with dialogue to make it truly great season. <br />Good action episodes include:<br />1) EMISSARY - The 90-minute pilot introduces all of the characters and some of their backstory, as well as create a mysterious atmosphere for the show. But what really grabs people from the start is the first 5 minutes, where we see the Borg/Federation battle at Wolf 359. Powered by great special effects, (covincing enough for a feature film) this is the best part of the whole season.<BR>2) CAPTIVE PURSUIT - A great action episode, with O'Brien helping an alien creature named Tosk escape people who are \\"hunting\\" him. This is the first episode in which we see intruders in the station and the inner workings of the space staion (vent shafts, access pipes, etc.)<BR>3) BATTLE LINES - Another great action episode, where Kira, Sisko, Bashir, and Kai Opaka crash on a planet where two rival clans are fighting and it is impossible to die. Good acting by Nana Visitor in this one.<br />Good character-driven episodes:<br />1) A MAN ALONE; VORTEX - Great Odo episodes. More great ones would follow with 3rd season's \\"The Search\\" being the payoff.<BR>2) PAST PROLOGUE - A great Kira epidode. It fills in some of her troubled backstory and shows that she's tough.<BR>3) THE PASSENGER - A good Bashir epidode. Finally gives Alenxander Siddig the opportunity to be a villain.<BR>4) THE NAGUS - A funny Quark epidode that introduces the hilarious Grand Nagus Zek and shows the workings of Ferengi politics. <br />All of the other epidoes are mediocre and don't establish anything important. The season ender IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPHETS is fairly good, but only from the point of view that it's setting the stage for the second season's show-stopping opening trilogy (The Homecoming, The Circle, The Siege).<br />All in all, this season introduces all of the characters pretty well, as well as the station itself. It also sets up some of the sub-plots and minor characters that would make appearances in later seasons. But the second, third, and fourth seasons far surpass this one. I would only get this set it you're compeltely unfamiliar with DS9 or must OWN EVERY SINGLE SEASON of Star Trek. <br />1993; Roughly 20 hours; Contains mild sci-fi action violence and brief language.
B000005JAX|4.0|The songwriter of Depeche Mode decided to enter the Sam Therapy Studios in London the same year his band was producing their most selling album up to date (Violator). The result: these six songs correctly performed by Martin, where Compulsion, In a manner of speaking and Never turn your back on mother earth are the highlights of the EP. If you like Depeche Mode, you should have this cd in your collection, that's my recommendation.
B00007BK2N|4.0|Folks who don't listen to alternative music (and I mean REAL alternative music, not the nu-metal garbage that's been promoted as alternative over the last few years) may not realize it, but since the late 1970s, the city of Manchester, England has been home to one of the most amazing music scenes in the world. 24 Hour Party People is a fascinating dramatized look at this incredibly influential scene.  The story starts with the Sex Pistols' first show in Manchester.  Only 42 people attended, but most of them went on to either start bands or otherwise help get things going.<br />The narrative center of the movie is one man who attended that concert, Tony Wilson.  A local TV personality, Cambridge journalism graduate (he occsionally mentions this as he struggles to be taken seriously), punk rock advocate, promoter, and manager, Wilson was also the nominal head of Factory Records, which released extremely influential postpunk records by Joy Division, and later, New Order.  Wilson and his New Order partners also opened the Hacienda club, which gave birth to the \\"Madchester\\" rave culture of the late 80s and early 90s. The notoriously drug-addled and self-destructive Happy Mondays are shown in all their glory as they emerge from this scene under Wilson's \\"guidance\\" (as the movie shows, trying to manage the Mondays was roughly like trying to clean up a massive oil spill with a paper towel).<br />Though Wilson is a fascinating character in his own right, the heart of the movie is the bands, their music, and the machinations of the music industry.  Wilson himself was far more interested in being a sort of \\"sponsor of the arts\\" than in making money, and the movie gleefully shows one business failure after another.  Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis tragically hangs himself on the eve of the band's first American tour.  New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" becomes the biggest selling 12\\" single of all time, but they lose 5 pence for every copy they sell because of the artistic but costly packaging.  The Hacienda is massively popular but makes no money, for the drug of choice is Ecstasy, not alcohol.<br />Through it all, the movie does an excellent job of hewing to a narrow path between mockumentary and drama, irony and sincerity, humor and sensitivity. The results are impressive: this is one of the best movies I have seen about music in a particular time and place.  The acting is generally excellent, especially Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson and Sean Harris giving an uncanny performance as Ian Curtis.  My only complaint is that the movie lacks depth.  We don't learn very much about most of the characters other than Wilson, and such seminal bands as the Smiths and the Stone Roses don't even appear.  That's a pretty minor complaint, though, given the enormous breadth and influence of the Manchester scene.
B00009TB5G|2.0|The coming out on DVD of an extended edition of \\"The Two Towers\\" gives me a chance to air some of my thoughts regarding Peter Jackson's adaptational techniques before they are buried under several hundred other (probably rave) reviews.  And though, like these other reviewers, I too appreciate the hard-work, dedication, and expert craftsmanship that have gone into making this version of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" the most stunning yet to appear on film, I do not think history will be kind to it in the end.<br />This is not b/c I am a Tolkien purist, or do not understand the fundamental differences between literature and film.  I generally liked \\"Fellowship\\", and fully approved of the changes made to the story whenever they served the interests of narrative or pacing.  My only complaint with it was that it often felt too much like an action movie, with no pauses to build tension, mood, or atmosphere as the characters went from one battle (or chase) to the other.  Sadly, these genre tendencies have only been exaggerated in the second film, and have taken it over to such an extent that even fundamental plot points have been altered just to better fit the zig-zag rising action pattern of most action movies.  This explains not only major changes (the battle with the Wargs, Aragorn's \\"death\\"), but also minor ones (Gandalf's warning that retreating to Helm's Deep only created a trap; Merry & Pippin having to \\"trick\\" Treebeard into intervening).  In most action films, everything the heroes achieve until the final confrontation either have mixed results, or are a choice between evils, as this ratchets up the tension.  \\"The Two Towers\\" slavishly follows this formula, hence the deviations from text which have so infuriated some Tolkien fans.<br />Such changes as were made I would be willing to endure and more if they produced a film that still kept the dignity and moral seriousness of the books; as is, though, I think what's been created is a medieval version of \\"Independence Day\\", and fans will, in the end, turn just as savagely on this film as they did on that other one.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD is too awesome to explain with words. It can keep you relaxed late at night or you can headbang to it with all your friends. My friends and I mimic Jimmy on the solos. I definatly recommend it. It was worth ever dollar of the [$] i payed for it.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Adding to the already great hit, the fellowship of the ring comes the platinum set of the two towers. This should be the best way ever to watch this movie. This is a must add to your collection. The main reason is it adds 45 minutes of never seen before footage into the movie, not including the 5 hours of bonus material! I cant wait. It will be a great thing to see before the release of the return of the king
B000002JEV|5.0|I still prefer this to \\"How the West was Won\\" - superior sound recording (if a little quiet on the audience side).  This is a devastating band ascending its peak.  A must-have.<br /><br />What you should get this for: Disc 1's live set.  The blistering version of Commmunication Breakdown and I Can't Quit You Babe from 1969 are my favourite renditions in Zep's generally improvised approach to their live songs.  On Disc 2, Heartbreaker from 1971 is as good as it gets.  And the ferocity of Robert Plant's voice nearly bursts the microphones on Since I've Been Loving You and Black Dog.<br /><br />The rest of Disc 1 is radio stuff - ie. versions created for radio.  They're nice but not essential. The only track which improves on the studio version is perhaps \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" - which is a much closer rendition to how the live versions would turn out.<br /><br />A nice companion to the new DVD release.
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix is a curiosity and it serves to highlight clearly the Wachowski brother's committment to this project. A series of short (each about ten minutes) animated adventures set in the world of the Matrix movies, The Animatrix explores the themes and possibilities of the movies using different techniques from CGI to traditional Anime.<br />As a fan of CGI the two standout pieces for me were \\"Last Flight of the Osiris\\" and \\"Matriculated\\". \\"Last Flight of the Osiris\\" (from the team responsible for \\"Final Fantasy\\") is jaw dropping state of the art hyper-real CGI. It is obvious that much of the Matrix Reloaded was produced in this way. The opening scene is absolutely delicious as two very attractive CGI characters disrobe eachother in a virtual martial arts sword fight. The piece goes on to illustrate a link between the first two movies in the Matrix trilogy.<br />But the one that really got me was \\"Matriculated\\". An astounding blend of CGI and handrawn animation this film really explores the possibilities of the medium and the results are mind-blowing, and quite psychadelic in places. A curious story about a group of humans who attempt to convert machines to their cause, \\"Matriculated\\" really pushes the boundaries. For hardcore fans it is worth owning the DVD for these two pieces alone, however the other pieces are excellent too, using more standard animation techniques to tell their stories. Those with a passing interest in the Matrix movies will probably be happier just renting The Animatrix.<br />If you are unfamiliar with Anime it is worth noting that it often contains strong violence and sexual material, and the Animatrix is no exception. One scene in particular depicted violence against a robot made to look like a human woman and I found this quite uncomfortable to watch.<br />After watching The Animatrix I am left feeling confident that despite the unexpected success of the first Matrix movie, the Wachowski brothers are committed to bringing the Matrix tothe World with integrity. A lot of people have been disappointed in the second movie, but seen in the context of an action packed comic book sci-fi saga it all makes sense, and its really working for me. It is not going to be to everyone's taste, but this is to the directors' credit, not to their detriment.
B00005JLF5|5.0|This was of course, the most watched of all the Star Trek franchises and the most critically acclaimed as well, winning an Emmy and the respect of many non-trek audiences. While I'm writing this, rumors abound in Paramount and ST circles that Avery Brooks will be the next big-screen Capt. Many say this is some of the best TV ever to be had. If you missed it the first time around, prepare to be astounded ...<br /><br />The complete first season includes 20 episodes:<br /><br />01. Emissary (1): Stardate: 46379.1 3 years after the devastation of WOLF 359, the Borg attack upon the Federation, Cmdr. Sisko is attached to DS9 with some great inter-change between a man he hates ... Capt. Jean Luc Picard.<br /><br />02. Emissary (2): Stardate: 46392.7 On a distant outpost at the edge of the final frontier, an untested crew embarks on an unprecedented journey. A nice wrap to the two-part debut of the Star Trek franchise's greatest achievement.<br /><br />03. Past Prologue: Stardate: 46397.3 A reunion with a member of the Bajoran underground forces Kira to choose between her people and her duty as a Federation officer. The fiery Nana Visitor gets another haircut and is rebellious as ever. Magnificent beginnings to her character.<br /><br />04. A Man Alone: Stardate: 46421.5 Security Chief Odo's character is questioned when he is implicated in the murder of a shady Bajoran. An interesting episode that sees the creation of Keiko's school and a lynching for Odo.<br /><br />05. Babel: Stardate: 46423.7 A mysterious epidemic sweeps over Deep Space Nine, and Kira must find an antidote. So much for the universal translator. A good story to build upon what we know of Bajor.<br /><br />06. Captive Pursuit: Stardate: 46477.5 O'Brien and the rest of the officers of Deep Space Nine learn that other beings do not respect life as much as they do. Clearly an homage to the old Star Trek series style of storytelling. This was a brilliant episode.<br /><br />07. Q-Less: Stardate: 46531.2 Q and Vash introduce themselves to the crew of Deep Space Nine, while the officers struggle to save the station from imminent destruction. What a shame that John DeLancie as Q was treated with such disdain in this series, as he was one of the most interesting characters from the Next Gen series.<br /><br />08. Dax: Stardate: 46910.1 Curzon Dax, Jadzia's former Trill identity, is accused of murder. A great episode for Rene Auberjonois, a throw back to the Original Series style of writing. Worth while.<br /><br />09. The Passenger: Stardate: 46570.8 The crew's efforts to thwart a hijack scheme are complicated when a sinister alien criminal hides his consciousness within the brain of someone aboard the station. A good Episode for Sid, some of the first counter-play between his future real-life wife and himself, Nana Visitor.<br /><br />10. Move Along Home: Stardate: 46612.4 Quark's attempt at deception toward a newly-encountered alien race places the space station's senior officers in a labyrinth of danger. A fascinating episode that finds \\"The Hawk\\" singing for his life. Voted most memorable by a lot of ST fans.<br /><br />11. The Nagus: Stardate: 46657.0 Quark is suddenly named leader of the Ferengi financial empire, and discovers that he's not only popular  he's now a target for death. Fantastically acted by Armin Shimerman, who helps the series take off by breathing real life into an overlooked race of people from Next Gen.<br /><br />12. Vortex: Stardate: 46689.6 An alien criminal from the other side of the wormhole tempts Odo by telling the shape-shifter he can put the changeling in contact with others like himself. This is the beginning of the Changeling myth that becomes larger in the story line later. A must see. A great performance from Rene Auberjonois.<br /><br />13. Battle Lines: Stardate: 46715.2 Sisko, Kira, and Bashir and Kai Opaka are stranded on a war-torn world where it is impossible for the combatants to die. While this is moderately entertaining, it ispivotal for the former plot-lines to come and a must see.<br /><br />14. The Storyteller: Stardate: 46729.1 Against his will, O'Brien becomes spiritual leader of a Bajoran village and the only one who can save them from a destructive energy force. An interesting episode where Bashir and O'Brian become better friends.<br /><br />15. Progress: Stardate: 46844.3 A stubborn old Bajoran farmer forces Kira to take a good look at how much she has changed since her alliance with the Federation. Played remarkably by Brian Keith. This is also the famed Yamok Sauce episode where Jake and Nog team up for an acquisition.<br /><br />16. If Wishes Were Horses: Stardate: 46853.2 When members of the station find their fantasies coming to life, it becomes the prelude to a very real danger which threatens everyone. Sisko realizes the ruse of an elaborate first-contact at the close.<br /><br />17. The Forsaken: Stardate: 46925.1 While an alien entity wreaks havoc with the station's computer, the irrepressible Lwaxana Troi falls in love with Odo. This is perhaps the best of the Lwaxana Troi episodes from both series.<br /><br />18. Dramatis Personnae: Stardate: 46922.3 Odo is caught in the middle when an alien influence pits Kira against Sisko in a deadly struggle for control of the station while all of the Humanoids have become infected with a viral history of a dead planet. Good episode, but a bit nerve wracking.<br /><br />19. Duet: Stardate: Stardate: 46933.4 Kira discovers that a Cardassian visiting the station could actually be a notorious war criminal. An amazing episode that highlights the Cardassian culture and is really brought to life by the acting of Harris Yulin. This is hands down the best episode of Season 1, and it's a real tear-jerker as well.<br /><br />20. In the Hands of the Prophets: Stardate: 46951.7 An assassination / political manipulation plot thickens between Vedek Winn and Vedek Bariel which builds during season 2. A well crafted episode that centers around the storyline of Bajor and Keiko's school.<br /><br />* All Stardates can be verified through the Star Trek / DS9 Mission Logs database.gainst his will, O'Brien becomes spiritual leader of a Bajoran village and the only one who can save them from a destructive energy force.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|i love this movie so much...it has lots of blood and gore in it.  i think it's alot better than the 1st one...unfortunately none of mae friends believe me. humph...well, they had just better c the movie.  those mutant vampires were really creepy...when they feed on a victim it look'd like it hurt...i'm sure glad that wasn't me...ANYWAYS...this is a regular guy kind of movie...i'm not a guy though...so, look who's talkin. huh, too many of mae gurlfriends like lovey dovey chic flix...I HATE THEM!!!!!! give me a bloody action packed movie anyday. i'm sorry if this review doesn't make sense.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I didn't buy this cd when it first came out probably due to the provocative nature of the first video.  I happened to come across it at a listening station at a local bookstore and gave it a listen and was surprised at the quality of songs on this cd.  A couple of my favorites include infatuation and impossible.
B00008DDXB|4.0|I thought that this movie stayed pretty true to the book. Of course, most books are better than the movie, and this is no exception and that is why I gave this movie 4 stars.<br />I love the characters, and it is so wonderful to actually see things on the screen. It was so great that all the characters from the first movie were also in this one. I do think that some of the images might be too graphic for younger kids, especially the final &quot;fight/battle&quot; scene. All in all, it's another great edition to the Harry Potter movie series!
B00005JKPF|3.0|I did like x2 it was good, but not good enough, A lot of people are hyped up about this film so much mainly because of the sound,<BR>costumes and \\"special fx\\". Yes it was great i love that but there are lots of flaws & bad direction. The director & hollywood should know this by now. When your taking a story from a comic book or any book you should have someone who is professional in adapting stories from books. They know that they should have got someone who is familiar with the legacy of the x-men and is an excellent writer instead of getting a director who has never seen or read the xmen books or watched the animation. The phoenix came waaaaaaaaaaayy too soon in the comic the phoenix didn't come until decades later & it happened in space. What happen to storms blue eyes? The main thing is is that the story revolved around wolverine too much. They made cyclops a punk in this movie when we all know that cyclops is 1 of the most powerful mutants. In the comics cyclops kicks [tail] all around the place. Even \\"James Marsden\\"(cyclops) told the director to make cyclops fight more in this film. This Movie is good food without the spices & seasoning added. The best thing in this film was \\"NightCrawler\\" & \\"Mystique. The plot is a little uneven & there's something missing.
0792101448|5.0|I was going to say that this is the greatest of the spaghetti westerns but truthfully, this movie is bigger than that. Every single thing about is incredible. The theme, the filming and the music is almost operatic. The casting of Henry Fonda as one of the most vicious villains ever seen in a movie was brilliant. Fonda tears into the role. Claudia Cardinale never looked as gorgeous again and Jason Robards, as the movie's wise man takes what could've been just a supporting character and makes him a hero. Finally, there's Charles Bronson, playing a  man with no name, a man with only one thing to live for. When the camera leans in for a close up of Bronson's eyes they are cold, empty and seemingly dead. The only time he allows them to light up is when he looks at Claudia and when he and Fonda finally have their little chat. Every time I watch this film I see something that I never noticed before.  It's great.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|About A Boy is a very realistic movie with a strong tug on the heartstrings.  Hugh Grant plays a believable slightly slimy single guy who just skates through life not caring about much else besides his material possessions and an occasional roll in the hay.  Not having to work hard at anything in his entire life, he devises a plan to meet needy single mothers at a single parents group.  His plan takes an unexpected turn when he unintentionally befriends a misfit 12-year-old boy who is looking for a new husband for his depressed mother. <br />This has a lot of humor along with the serious theme.  I feel it is realistic because it shows life and people are not always perfect, things don't always work out the way you plan and life as a child is not always happy.<br />I would recommend this movie highly to own, it's a keeper.  The PG-13 rating is appropriate for some upsetting moments.
B00007GZVV|5.0|I love deep movies and this one is by far the deepest movie I've ever seen. I've watched it dozens of times and still manage to find something different each time that makes me love it more.
0451167716|5.0|I saw the movie first, and it become one of my favorites. Out of summer boredom i decided to read the book. It is one of the best book i've ever read. it provides much more information on the characters seen in the movie. Characters are brought to life that you barely notice in the movie, such as Johnny Fontane, and Lucy Marcini(the girl at Connie's wedding that Sonny cheats with). Mario Puzo really took the time to develope each character. All of the many characters are 3 dimensional, and have a unique personality. I have never read a book this involved in the story. It is very intriging,and well developed. The Godfather is a true classic. Anyone who loves the movie will find a new appreciation for it by reading Mario Puzo's masterpiece.
6302787068|5.0|Robin Williams is perfectly cast as the Genie in a memorable stand out performance. Very funny and romantic.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Gangs Of New York is a good movie, but it's boring inthe middle, yhey just talk, thats is why it gets 4 stars...But I recommend you to se it!
0060920084|5.0|I laughed so many times reading this book, it hurt my belly. I recognized many people just like the ones I grew up with back home.<BR>  This look at the foibles of small town America will have you rolling on the floor.... and sharing with your friends the devastating slices of life he so ably portrays.<BR>    Get this book for no other reason than to lend it to your best (open-minded) friends.
B000068TPN|2.0|I'll start off by saying I didn't dislike this movie as much as I thought I would. A few characters, particularly the narrator, are redeemable on more than just a stereotypical war hero level, and there's even a nice little scene where Mel writes a letter to a fallen NVA soldier, who must have been at least part human since he wrote stuff in a diary.<br />The film has potential as a compelling war movie, and there are brief sparks of this throughout. The majority of the execution falls flat.<br />Let's run through the list of stereotypes: we've got good ol' Mel, trying his gosh-darndest to not leave a single man behind; Mel's hard-ass SOB veteran major who's killed oodles of foreigners in other wars; the idealistic, loving, and coincidentally totally hot war wives; not one, but TWO naive youngsters with a future ahead of them and newborns at home who die (oops, did I give something away?); and of course, plenty of practically immobile Asians to gun down whenever slow-motion shots of American soldiers won't suffice. <br />At its best, the film starkly depicts the horrors of war; at its worst (which it leans towards for the majority), it's merely a by-product of sappy post 9/11 sentiments.<br />Good enough story, bad execution, cliches by the barrelful. Ho hum.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Some reviewers have said a person has to listen to a Radiohead Album multiple times to really understand the medium and the message. My CD only recently arrived in the mail, so this is an early review.<br />Lyrics like \\"Go tell the king that the sky is falling in when it is not. Maybe not,\\" along with pensive music, and of course the title, offer us some perspective for these trying times in the U.S., and around the world.  September 11 was tragic, but our longer term response may be more tragic in a widespread sense---some misguided and damaging foreign adventures. I hope not, but who knows? And threats to our basic civil liberties at home. We all want security and freedom from fear, but at what price?<br />Radiohead may indeed be the first band to show us a roadmap (like the cover) as we work our way through this new century. It is a world music band and offers much food for thought.<br />I first heard Radiohead just before Sept. 11 on a 10 hour flight back from England. It was the featured group on one of the in-flight audio channels, with music and discussion. Since then I have been hooked, and hooked on a band far different than I have ever followed.<br />So take a look and listen to this new CD.  And together maybe we can find a true roadmap out of our current troubles.<br />Peace
B00005JMC6|5.0|This is a thoroughly satisfying but very, very unusual movie.  Set in Auckland, New Zealand, in the present among members of a Maori tribe struggling to find a new leader, the movie is primarily about acceptance and rejection, and the difficulty of meeting expectations.  The central character is an eleven-year-old girl, Pai, marvelously portrayed by newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Life starts off badly for her, with her mother dying in childbirth giving birth to Pai and her twin brother, who is stillborn.  Her father more or less deserts her, partly because of the pain of losing his wife and son, but partly because of the strained relations with his father Koro, who was convinced that the infant boy would become the new leader of their tribe.<br />Pai wants to take a place of leadership within her tribe, but is prevented by her rigidly traditional grandfather.  Although smart and respectful of her ancestors and the traditional ways and beliefs, she is denied any potential role because of her gender.  The film focuses both on her attempt to fulfill the role she feels calling out to her, and her attempt to win the affection and acceptance of her grandfather, whom she loves despite his hostility.<br />This is a beautiful film, and the climax is as satisfying as one could hope.  One must allow oneself to become a bit of a believer in things mystical and magical, else the film won't work at crucial moments.<br />The film is populated with complete unknowns, except for Cliff Curtis, who plays Pai's father.  He has appeared in a large number of big budget Hollywood films, frequently as heavies, including THREE KINGS, COLLATERAL DAMAGE, and TRAINING DAY.  Just about everyone does an excellent job, though Keisha Castle-Hughes and Rawiri Paratene as Koro stand out.<br />Although many of the houses are inexpensive looking and even in some instances mildly dilapidated, nothing can disguise the extreme physical beauty of the locale.  With a large bay and sandy beach facing the ocean, and striking, magnificent mountains ascending behind the houses, the location is strikingly beautiful.<br />This is not always an easy film to watch.  Some of the scenes in which various individuals are expressing their feelings can be very hard to take, and Rawiri Paratene can express anger that is extremely realistic.  Nonetheless, this film as a whole is one that deals with the possibility of healing, of acceptance, and of learning to expand the boundaries of one's conception of the world.  I recommend it highly.he ocean, and striking, magnificent mountains ascending behind the houses, the location is strikingly beautiful.<br />This is not always an easy film to watch.

0812548094|1.0|Who is writing these reviews?  Have they read any OTHER fantasy?  Have they read Jordan, Martin, Tolkien?  Have they read King's Dark Tower series?<br />This book &quot;borrows&quot; so much material from Jordan it's almost ridiculous.  This, in itself, is inexcusable, but even worse the story is terrible.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The cinematography was amazing, and so was the acting. The Two Towers was jam packed with action, thrills, and surprises! The scenes that were done digitally were nearly seamless, and the places like Isengard, and Helms Deep were done superbly! This movie has tons of great music clips like Gollum's song, and the music from Helms Deep. This movie is totally amazing and I can name none which I liked better!
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie is AWESOME.  Much better than anything out there, especially Matrix Reloaded.  GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You wont regret it!

The theory pages do not waste my time and do not insult my intellegence. The reference pages get to the point.<br />VB programmers with no C experience will find this book very accesable.
B000002L5P|5.0|Did anyone do catchy, depressing, british pop/rock before the Smiths?   Morissey, unlike many of the songwriters in the music industry, is a real and well educated poet (true, many of his lyrics are ad-libed). Johnny Marr has an uncanny knack for really cool riffs.  This band is tight and, although most of their albums have more than their fair share of good songs, this first album is especially good...their best.
B00005K9LM|3.0|I give this album 3 stars because it isn't one of Judas Priest's best efforts. The inclusion of the two small tracks, \\"Heavy Duty\\" and \\"Defenders of the Faith,\\" makes this release somewhat weaker then their previous releases. DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH also lacks any really popular tracks from the band, although that might be a good thing. It doesn't contain any radio staples such as \\"Living After Midnight\\" from BRITISH STEEL or \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" from SCREAMING FOR VENGENCE. Regardless, this album is still a solid effort.<br /> DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH has songs that still rock. \\"Freewheel Burning\\" kicks off the album in a similar fashion as \\"Rapid Fire\\" from BRITISH STEEL. \\"Jawbreaker\\" has great guitar work from Downing that pulls the song into a frenzy. \\"Rock Hard, Ride Free\\" is my favorite track with it's mid-paced beat and excellent guitar solo at the bridge. It was actually written for HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (KILLING MACHINE) under a different title, but was re-written and used for this album. \\"The Sentinal\\" starts out slow then kicks into a catchy rocker that provides a good follow-up to \\"Rock Hard, Ride Free.\\" Ironically, this was the first Judas Priest album I bought, and I was rather impressed. DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH may not be as strong as other records by Judas Priest, but it still stands as a hard and solid example of what 80's metal is all about.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Here's my two cents on the disjointed/odd nature of the short films.  I think it's best to view this collection as like a &quot;special feature&quot; of &quot;deleted scenes&quot; from the Matrix trilogy, things that fans might want to see afterwards, but aren't quite good enough for, or don't fit into, the movies.  I for one like seeing deleted scenes from movies I really like, and I think this DVD is best for people who have a more active interest in the world of the Matrix.
0553212737|4.0|Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you.
B000002NBY|5.0|I'm not a big fan of soft rock, but ever since discovering Paul Simon, surprisingly, when I was six or seven, I fell in love with the music, and overtime, I fell in love with the lyrics.  Simon's cerebral lyrics, catchy beats, and delightfully quirky observations on human nature and his own life make for transcendent pop, as one reviewer of this album called it.  Just one last thing: it's artists like Paul Simon and James Taylor who make soft rock good and tasteful, not like this Michael Bolton or Mariah Carey {stuff}.  <br />Anyway, \\"Graceland\\" is brilliant, just brilliant, an intoxicating fusion of excellent lyrics, poppy melodies, and exotic South African rhythms and instruments.  This album couldn't have been released at a better time than 1986, when apartheid was in full bloom in South Africa.  It just blasts the principle, and it feels good, and even now, it's tremendously influential.  Now, let's go song by song and do a critique:<br />\\"Boy in the Bubble\\"-The opening track kicks off the album with a bang.  Simon's angry lyrics combined with his gentle, low-key voice to illustrate a thought-provoking tale of the bitter irony between the First World and the Third World.  The accordion and rhythms make a perfect melody for the mood of the lyrics.<br />\\"Graceland\\"-The title track is very catchy, about (you guessed it), a trip to Graceland.  Simon's lyrics make you think of taking a long car trip.  Perfect song for a long car trip!<br />\\"I Know What I Know\\"-Clever, witty lyrics combine with exotic guitar tuning and somewhat silly African chants.  Great fun.<br />\\"Gumboots\\"-This is the funniest song on the album.  Simon's witty observations of life in the city and crazy happenings combine with a somewhat Tejano-sounding melody.<br />Heck, it goes on like this.  Just listen to the whole album!  What more can a guy say?  If you want a cerebral, sophisticated, earthy edge to your soft rock, pick this up right away.  Eat your heart out, Michael Bolton!
B00007GZVR|5.0|This is one of those laugh until you fall on the floor funny comedies. One of the most overlooked great films of the 1990's. Next to Fargo Joel and Ethan's best movie in my humble opinion.
B0000542DJ|5.0|This film is capable of far more than simply entertaining it's viewers for a few hours. For me, this film evoked one of the strongest emotional reactions I've ever had to a movie. This film will leave you in a cognitive, and perhaps even betrayed, state of mind. <br />First, I would like to point out that I am fully aware that this film is not entirely factual. I understand that some liberties were taken with the way that the historical events actually unfolded, but that doesn't mean that it's completely false. While this movie is a work of fiction, there is a great deal of true information that accompanies the aforementioned fiction. From what I understand, Stone did not intend this film to be taken as entirely factual, but instead for the viewer to get the overall message that it's important not to believe everything the government tells you just because it's what the government tells you. As the character Jim Garrison says in the movie (I'm paraphrasing here), all it takes is a few corrupt individuals with power to perpetuate a massive lie. I think that this is something that all would do well to remember for the next time the government, or any one else for that matter, proposes a questionable story, such as the non sense one shooter/magic bullet theory.<br />Now that the history vs. fiction aspect is out of the way, onto the movie itself. I can honestly say that this is one of the most solid movies I've ever seen. From direction, to acting, to writing, to editing, this movie is absolutely remarkable. I personally believe it to be Oliver Stone's finest cinematic offering to date, with Natural Born Killers coming in at an extremely close second. <br />The film features an ensemble cast who all turn in fantastic performances, especially Gary Oldman and Kevin Costner. Costner's portrayal of Jim Garrison is entertaining and wholly believable. Gary Oldman also gives a fantastic performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, he truly manages to capture the character. The rest of the cast is also very good. Micheal Rooker, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and Donald Sutherland all provide great supporting performances. Donald Sutherland is terrific as Garrison's CIA insider source. His speech he gives while walking in the park is one of the finest points in the movies. I also liked John Candy's performance as Jim's friend from law school who had been asked to be Oswald's attorney. He was one character I don't think we saw enough of.<br />Stone's direction here is also incredible. He does a marvelous job at depicting society's reaction to the assassination of JFK. Many are saddened by the loss while others are thrilled by the idea of removing a \\"Castro sympathizer\\" from the highest office in the country. Stone is also very adept at 'taking the viewer along for the ride', for lack of a better phrase. The deeper into the conspiracy Garrison goes, the deeper you go and I at least felt as though I were there every step of the way, until the final courtroom seen where the viewer is put more in the position of the jury than in the position Garrison.<br />The editing in this film is remarkable as well. Splicing of black and white footage into the film as well as the use of 35 mm footage is genious. I can't imagine the amount of time and work that must've gone into the editing process of this movie. I think that's it's probably the best I've ever seen.<br />The writing is also phenomenal. The script is very well researched and the dialog is very absorbing. The conversations are informational, but not to the point that they become boring. I think the writers managed to strike a nice balance in that respect.<br />But even with all that aside, even without the great editing, directing, and writing, the film still works on a personal level. The JFK era may be well before my time, but I can still identify with Garrison's quest for justice and truth. I think that Garrison's desire for honesty is the real universal message hear, and I think that it's something all viewers will be able to identify with. The need for truth is something that humanity will always have, and I think that through that need this film will live on for a very long time.

B00008WG3U|1.0|I just wish they would keep their political ideals out of there music.  I think their music is great but I can't stand their views on many things.  They'd be much better if they stuck to what they do best...making punk music, not preaching politics!

B00005QIPH|5.0|When I first got the CD I had no clue who they were. But after listening to it over and over I realized it really was amazing. All the songs flow perfectly and you can't find a crappy song on the album, which is something even the Velvet Underground couldn't accomplish. After such a stunning debut, I look forward to the next album of theirs' coming out.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is the best concert DVD available today - bar none. If you enjoy concert videos, you don't want to be without this set in your collection. The sound is sensational and the enhancment/restoration of all the 24 - 33 year old footage is remarkable. The only way this set could have been made better is if it were filmed and recorded today. It's simply a &quot;Whole Lotta Fun.&quot; <br />One technical problem - Has anyone who owns this DVD noticed a problem with the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack on the Albert Hall disc? There's severe distortion. It's particularly noticable during &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; on the harmonica. The Stereo PCM and DTS tracks are perfect. The problem is only with the Dolby 5.1. I haven't heard or read anything about this problem. Wondering if I got a copy from a bad pressing (I had returned it for another copy. Same problem). I'm trying to find out if the DVD company is aware of this and offering replacements. Anyway this disc is GREAT!

B00006ZXSK|5.0|My best friend first recommended this movie to me back in 1998 and at first I thought the premise sounded lame, but I ended up LOVING it since I forgot how much I love Drew Barrymore, esp. when she plays roles that make her look pretty and glam! Also, i normally don't find guys with long hair attractive but Dougray Scott is so endearing as the prince . . . Anjelica Huston is perfect as the wonderfully cold and cruel stepmother.<br />The director did an amazing job of updating this fairy tale, sort of making it a girl power flick, where the damsel in distress rescues herself many times!. . . I highly, highly, highly recommend!
0156027321|5.0|A recommendation at an airport bookstore along with the paragraph on the book's back caused me to purchase this book.  I absolutely devoured the book as Pi devoured any edible substance on his journey. Delightful to read yet deep enough to say it is not fluff!  I recommend highly and am passing along to 4 people at work that want to read this fun  and enlightening summer novel.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you have a Dolby Digital system, this is the DVD for you.  The concert audio is flawless.  The remix into 5.1 and DTS is superb.  The video is good and the presentation is good but the AUDIO is the unbelievable.  The 1970 show at the Royal Albert Hall just jams.<br />I can't get over how good it sounds.  The extras are great. If you a Zep fan BUY THIS and play it on a good Dolby digital system.

The Two Towers soundtrack matches the unique and magical quality about the movie while giving listeners a new experience.  It's perfect for fans of the books and/or movies, people who love instrumental music, or anyone searching for something different.  Some of my favorite tracks include: Foundations of Stone, The Uruk-hai, Helm's Deep, Breath of Life, Forth Eorlingas, and Isengard Unleashed.  The cd ends off on an eerie note with \\"Gollum's Song\\".  I highly recommend this cd!! You won't regret it!!!
B00006690G|5.0|one year after buying the eminem show, one year after playing it for two months straight and getting burned out on it, i look back and realize it was one of the greatest albums i had ever heard.  before i overplayed it, i felt it was, bar none, the greatest rap album of all time.  after playing it too much, i began thinking that maybe nas' 'illmatic,' the roots' 'things fall apart,' or even eminem's own 'slim shady LP' were better.<br />however, when i think about how much i loved this CD for those few months, i realize that this is my favorite record of all time (despite what my other reviews say).  not only is eminem a master of lyricism; he rides the beat better then ANYONE i have EVER heard.<br />i disagree with many song-by-song reviews on here (did someone actually say 'soldier' was a bad song?  are you crazy?!?), so i'm going to do one myself.  lyrical ability and meaning come first to me, with beats second; if you feel the same way, hopefully these will help you.<br />1. Curtains Up  <BR>-skit. kinda a neat way to start the CD though.  the music, for lack of a better word, is pretty haunting.<br />2. White America  <BR>-eminem takes a stab at racism and the government in this song with a hard beat that em flows perfectly too.  powerful song that accomplishes what it was meant to.  8/10.<br />3. Business  <BR>-catchy hook, catchy beat, so-so lyrics.  ('how can one chandra be so levi?' sounds good and makes you chuckle, but doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense).  7/10.<br />4. Cleanin Out My Closet  <br />-flawless, angry song with lyrics pointed mainly to slim's mother.  very, very powerful.  you can feel his hate. 10/10.<br />5. Square Dance  <BR>-very, very catchy song with a few disses to canibus thrown in for  good measure.  great flow, good lyrics, great beat.  9/10.<br />6. The Kiss  <BR>-skit, leading into....<BR>      <BR>7. Soldier <BR>-wow.  is eminem the reincarnation of pac?  if this track is any indication, then the answer is yes.  eminem soundsso much like a lyrically suped-up tupac that it is scary.   another flawless song. (... know i'll never be marshall again.') 10/10. <BR>      <BR>8. Say Goodbye Hollywood   <BR>-incredibly deep song, as eminem wonders if it was worth it to become a huge rap star.  ('i sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back')  good lyrics, great flow, catchy hook.  8/10.     <br />9. Drips <BR>-underrated, but still probably the worst track on the album (which doesn't mean it is bad.  far from it).  personally, i love obie's style because he is so unpredictable.  he says a line, and makes it so you are 100% sure what the next line will be, and then will flip it on you.  ('now im frustrated cause my ... was unprotected / and dr. wesley tellin me i...'  every time i hear this song, i am sure obie will finish by saying ' got infected' but instead he says 'really got that ...') 6/10.<BR>       <BR>10. Without Me        <BR>-sure you have heard this one.  catchy, INSANE flow.  8/10.<br />11. Paul Rosenberg     <br />-skit.<BR>   <BR>12. Sing For the Moment      <BR>-quite possibly the greatest rock/rap song ever created.  amazing lyrics and sampling parts of aerosmith's 'dream on.'  contains the deepest line i have ever heard by a rapper: 'entertainment is changin, intertwining with gangsters /<BR>in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum.'  another flawless song.  10/10<BR>  <BR>13. Superman     <BR>-catchy, but too vanilla ice-like for my tastes.  6/10.<BR>   <BR>14. Hailie's Song  <BR>-one of the more heartfelt songs i have ever heard.  nearly brings a tear to my eye whenever he says 'it all makes sense when i look into her eyes.'  first two verses are sung, last is spit (amazingly so, i might add).  yet another perfect song.  10/10.<BR>      <BR>15. Steve Berman    <BR>-skit.    <br />16. When the Music Stops    <BR>-lyrically great song with d12, although loses a point for bizarres verse.  then again, proof's is good enough to bring it back up.  8/10.<br />17. Say What You Say<BR>-slightly disappointing dre/slim collab dissing JD.  certainly not as good as either of the two collabs on dre's CD.  7/10.<br />18. 'Till I Collapse  <BR>-WOW.  eminem kills it.  nate dogg kills it.  talk about a pump-you-up song.  again, this is flawless.  be warned, this song might make you get up from your computer and go do something.  10/10.<BR>      <BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy     <BR>-the first two verses are funny.  the hook is sweet.  the final verse is the best verse on the CD.  'more pain inside of my brain then in the eyes of a little girl on a plane, aimed at the world trade.'  just typing that gave me chills.  not a perfect song, but the third verse is perfect (notice how the beat changes during this verse).  9/10.<br />   <BR>20. Curtains Close  <BR>-hilarious closing skit with...you guessed it...ken kaniff, singing his own laugh-out-loud version of without me.  'guess who's back....back again....ken is back....tell some men.  rub my back, rub my back, rub my back....'<br />seriously, if you are a rap fan, you MUST have this CD.  rakim (you know, God) said this is the greatest rap album he has ever heard.  definitely cop this.
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5's debut &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is an soulfully astounding mix of rock, r &amp; b, jazz and funk. The band is constantly in a groove of super-funky rhythm, whether it be the album's stomping opener &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; to the slower, jazz-tinged vibe of &quot;Sunday Morning.&quot; Frontman Adam Levine's powerful voice and suave lyrics complement the immense rhythm of the band nicely. However, many tracks sound very crowded and irritatingly over-produced, like too many musical ideas were squeezed into limited sonic space. Auxiliary guitar riffs and extra vocal overdubs seem to swoop in from nowhere, and many of the track's intros seem more like the musical score to a horror film. Whichever the case, Maroon 5 displays much talent and musical sensibility, but bad production choices. The album is well worth your listen, however.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have to say one thing to people out there.  STOP COMPARING CHICAGO AND MOULIN ROUGE!  They are two completely different movies. Chicago is traditional in it's form, and uses the very distinct Fosse dance moves to heat up the screen.  Moulin Rouge uses pop songs along with a classic love story while turning it inside out using modern movie making techniques.  <br />I have to say one thing about Chicago.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was so hot in this movie, I am very suprised that the screen didn't burst into flames every time she was on it.  The film's All That Jazz opening is so impressive, it's hard to put into words.  I really liked the part when Velma whips around on \\"all...that...\\" and it turns into Roxie to complete the line, \\"JAZZ!\\" as part of her day dream.  Then, as the number continued, Roxie and Fred's movements imitated those being preformed on stage by Velma and the dancers.  It was a good idea from whoever had it.  <br />Also, Rob Marshall was the right guy to direct this stuff.  I honestly don't think anyone could have done a better job then he did on Chicago.  And, please, don't compare Rob to Baz!  Both were the right men to direct each movie they made.  <br />Some people are complaining that the movie's main characters are all murders or money hungry slimebags.  Well, it is what the original play Chicago was about, and I thought this would be obvious; It is a musical song and dance romp, not meant to be taken so seriously.  <br />Finally, I am sure a lot of people who see Chicago will enjoy it.  To those who don't, at least admire the excellent craftsmanship that went into it.
0385504209|5.0|This book captured me from the first page.  Intelligent and fast pace, it took me one day to finish this book.  I simply could not put it down.  Consequently, I went out and purchased Angels & Demons, another Dan Brown book - finished it in 2 days.  His thrilling stories suck you in and I must say that I THOUGHT I'd figured the story out many times, only to be corrected in the final pages.  I whole-heartedly recommend this book!
B00008YLV2|1.0|There are war movies I would like to watch again, such as Pearl Habor. But I definitely do not want to watch this movie the second time. It taxed my patience even during the first viewing. For it is very  poorly conceived as a movie: no characterization, no plot, no structure. As such, it is terribly boring. All one gets to see, for more than two hours, is brutality, blood, violence. Josh Hartnett is a talented actor, but he does not even  have a chance to show his talent, for, like war itself, this movie does not allow people to emerge as individuals, and this hurts the point of the movie, which is &quot;fighting for the man next to you.&quot; Great war movies do not just exhibit shooting, bombing, running and shouting. They show the audience who the soldiers are--not as machines, but as individuals, as human beings. This movie fails to do that, and for this reason, it fails to be moving.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Let me start off by saying that Spider-Man was/is my all-time favorite comic book superhero. I was actually infuriated when I saw the first teaser trailer back in early 2001. Why? Because I didn't think I could bear to see the mutilation of another comic hero, ala Batman and Superman. When it came out, I saw it with much hesitation.<BR>I was not disappointed at all. Probably the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation out there, and one of the best action/adventure movies that has graced the silver screen. One of the reasons this movie has such a wide appeal, is that Spider-Man is the most human of all superheroes. He's plagued by the same obstacles in life that we all are. Peter Parker is a nerd in high school, broken family, loves a girl that is (or seems to be) unattainable. He struggles to fit in just like the rest of us do. He's human, and uses all his resources unselfishly in trying to help others. <BR>And this is why Spider-Man does and will succeed as a movie franchise. If they stick to the comic books, Peter has some of his greatest challenges ahead. He struggles to win the affections of Mary-Jane (even though she knows who he REALLY is,) problems at work, struggles to find a job and make ends meet, not to mention some of Spider-Man's greatest villians and battles lie ahead (which eventually destroy his marriage to Mary Jane.) Look forward to Doctor Octopus, the return of Goblin, and my personal fave- Venom!<BR>Here's to hoping that our favorite Web-Head will enjoy a long and entertaining movie career.

B0000640S2|5.0|John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is in a prison for the events of the previous movie (see FIRST BLOOD), when his mentor, Col. Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) comes to see him about a mission back to Vietnam, where he has a pardon coming if he accepts. Rambo accepts and finds out the specifics: It seems that the government's looking for American MIA's in Vietnam that are still being held there. Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier), Rambo's superior on this mission, tells him two things: Take only photographs of the MIAs, and do not engage the enemy. Begrudingly, Rambo begins his mission, and not only takes photographs of the MIAs, but brings one with him. When Murdock hears about this, he orders the chopper supposed to fly Rambo back to pull out. Murdock was hoping for nobody. Rambo, betrayed by his own government, must now help the MIAs, with the help of Co (Julia Nickson), a renegade Vietnamese agent, get out of Vietnam. Of course there is opposition: The Russian army and the Vietnamese army.<br />The sequel had all but one thing. It had the action, dialogue quality, action, drama, and did I mention action? The only thing missing: the thriller quality of its predecessor. Still, a good film before rambo became completely superhuman in the next sequel, Rambo III (1988). The DVD, like all others in the trilogy, has excellent video and audio quality. The features start off with an good commentary by director George Cosmatos. He talks about the making of the movie, among other things. Next up is a documentary called \\"We Get to Win This Time: The Rambo Phenomenon\\", which focuses on elemenst of the film, like the Cold War era, why the Russians wre used, shooting in Mexico, and how James Cameron wrote the original screenplay (and Sly tweaked it) when the movie was still called \\"First Blood II: The Mission\\". Then you get your production notes, theatrical trailer, and either a video release trailer or TV spot (The quality of the second one makes it either one) All in all, a solidDVD release for any action fan.<br />RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II<BR>(1985, R)<BR>John J.

B000000OQF|5.0|This is a must have for any rock n' roll fan! Simply brilliant! Slash's guitar work is at its best on this one. And the rest of the band is tight too! I would also reccomend &quot;Use Your Illusion 1 &amp; 2&quot;.
B00008DDXC|4.0|While there were many things that were missing from this movie that were included in the book, you will not notice their lack. As far as following the main storyline of the novel and the dialogue, it is an excellent carry over.<br />If you enjoyed the novels or the first film, then this is a must see.
B00008LDPU|5.0|After reading some reviews it seems that fans of the Matrix either loved the Animatrix or hated it. If you're expecting these short animes to resemble anything like the Matrix then perhaps its not for you. But if you have an open mind to explore different visions and perspectives of the Matrix then you're in for a real treat.<br />This project after all was the brainchild of the brothers Wachowski who presented several of the original stories to be animated and who had the final say in which stories made the final cut. What I do like is that they allowed these top-notch anime producers to have lots of freedom is the way the stories were expressed and some of the producers created the most original stories of their own. Fans of Ninja Scroll, Aeon Flux, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop will not be dissapointed with this collection. It is a wonderful way to sample works from anime producers with vastly different styles and original storytelling. <br />\\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" \\"Renaissance\\" and \\"Program\\" are to me the most true to the Matrix. For originality in stories my favorites are: Kid's Story, Beyond, World Record, and Matriculated. For animated sequences that had me in awe are World Record (highly stylized), and A Detective's Story (effectively done in black and white). <br />And don't miss the Director's interviews and commentaries. This was my favorite part of the DVD offering. These interviews add so much more depth to the animes as the each producer guides the viewer in his unique vision and development of the storyboards. To me its ironic that these masters of anime are so unanimated in the way they describe their work! Rather, their interviews are refreshingly humble and down-to-earth, so unlike their Western-counterparts.<br />This DVD has me seeking out other works from these master anime producers.
0385504209|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who wants an ingenious yet easier read, with short chapters, and is perfect for people who enjoy both thinking and discovering. This is probably the best book I have ever read in my life.<br />It was a wonderful story, intriguing, mysterious and captivating. I cannot wait to someday visit Europe to see the works cited in the book. I found the citing to be accurate and perfect for the story. I learned a lot about Da Vinci works just by reading this. Further, through reading this book I looked more at my religious views.<br />The voice of the characters is strong, and all of them are believable, people that could be found anywhere. I thought that the way the main characters worked together was inspiring, and that the strength they had together was magical. The people involved in the mystery are all unique and yet recognizable. Everyone's role is distinct, yet they mesh easily.<br />This story was perfect because of the puzzles, symbols, legend, and art. Fascinating, absorbing and riveting, anyone can read and love this book; historians, puzzlers, conspiracy nuts, the average joe. Of course, that is just my teenage opinion; I could be wrong.

B0000019PA|5.0|Two different, completely unrelated friends of mine recommended this album as one of their all time favorites. I was told by one that it was the only cd that as she listened to the beginning of the first track, she instantly knew that she would love the entire album. Indeed, Neutral Milk Hotel is genius. I finally got &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; and listened to it on repeat for a long time. The songs put forth are melodic, layered, and beautiful. The variety in this album is splendid; the flow is perfect. I am amazed at the talent and skill in blending different instruments (acoustic to horns to bagpipes)and sounds to create such a complete effect.<BR>I still have the title track stuck in my head. And if you're not one to believe in love at first listen, this will certainly grow to be a favorite after only a short time.
0385504209|4.0|I read &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; years ago, and liked it so much that I toured the Languedoc region of France, so I was very familiar with the theme of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.  I  noticed that Jacques Sauniere shares the same surname as the priest of Rennes-le-Chateau---not a coincidence, I'm sure.  Brown has written an engrossing novel, but his style is more pulp than poetic, and the characters, for all their collective expertise,  are a bit slow on the uptake.  That said, I really enjoyed the book, and it's nice to see the Goddess get her due on the New York Times Best Seller list.
0316666343|5.0|This book I finished in less then one day!  It made me feel every emotion the people in the storyline were feeling.  It ran from happy to sad!  I felt everything from being a child, teen, adult,sister, daughter,mother!!!!  I only wish I had another book to follow it.  It was beautiful and as I write this,just remembering brings a tear to my eye.  I am giving my best friend this book to read.  Highly recommended!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Too many people who have reviewed Lateralus on this site have been far too much time comparing this album with past Tool endeavors, especially Aenema. What would you have them do: never evolve? never progress? never experiment and conquer new ground? These guys are pure artists; they're not some hacks who are content to put out the same nonsense album after album. They are out to make music that is interactive and challening, both for them as artists/musicians and to us as listeners/fans. <br />Clearly, this is a brilliantly written, produced, and performed album, and in my opinion, it is Tool's greatest work to date. It is less formatted and more experimental - musically and lyrically - and most fans are put off by experimentality, which is an attitude reflected by many of the reviews here. Most people don't like to get used to something new; they like their bands neatly packaged and understood without thinking. Tool isn't that kind of band. Their music demands interaction and though. If you're looking for a static band content to put the same [stuff] out over and over again, try Slipknot, Korn, Limp Bizkit or any other one of the phony, mass-marketed, and nauseating groups out there; but don't expect Tool to sink to that level.
1400031354|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining, this series has me definitely hooked. I have all but one. Keep them coming Alex!
B00005JLRT|5.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek since early childhood, and I was sad in VI when we finally said goodbye to Kirk and Co.  And I admit, it took me awhile  (Season 3 of TNG: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;)to warm-up to the TNG gang.  With this film, I would have to say that it is the finest film to feature TNG, and I am sad to see them go as well. I am not a fan of the other series, so this is an ending for me as well.  Thank God for DVD's, so I can revisit friends whenever I want to. Nemesis truly looks like a film and not an extended TV show: dark, edgy, and although predictable, somewhat magical.  The Enterprise E (my favorite part of the TNG films) looks as mighty as ever, and I am glad that they finally showed what she can do. The characters are alive and well, and I feel that this film was badly underrated.  If you are a fan like me, just enjoy it and take it for what it is worth.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you call yourself a Zeppelin fan, you owe it to yourself to view these DVD's.  The song selection is great, sampling everything from the thrashing Immigrant Song to the acoustic Going to California.  The production is simply amazing, from the track selection menus (just like a CD!) to the amazing quality of the sound and video footage.  The Earl's Court songs could have been filmed at an MTV Unplugged special within the last couple years.<br />Zeppelin is a live band.  I've never seen them live, being born in '76.  My previous experience with Zeppelin was limited to albums and the &quot;Song Remains The Same&quot; video.  These DVD's are like seeing Zeppelin as they were meant to be.
B00005JMC6|5.0|An unusual strength of this film is that though it's a film for adults it's also a movie to take children to.  They may not understand all of it, but they'll understand enough.  And you may discover things about those children, too, from their reaction to this film. But this film will move you, even if you don't have any children (even borrowed ones), to bring along.<br />Don't let me put you off, if \\"child-friendly movie\\" sounds to you like something with a Robin-Williams-voiceover from the lowest pits of Hollywood hell.  I feel that way about most movies \\"suitable for children\\". But this is something else; an emotionally honest, intense, and (I'm sorry; I'm not much good at this) life-enhancing film.  <br />This is not a children's movie in any ordinary sense: there is absolutely no pandering, no cuteness, and no cheap manipulation.  Nobody hurts another person in a clever and amusing way and milks applause by putting up one fist triumphantly and saying, \\"YESS!!\\"; and though the cast is not white, no-one looks at the camera and says, \\"Well, shee-it!\\", by way of comic relief; and no-one ... well, you get my drift.  In short, this film respects its cast, its story and its audience; it respects childhood and it respects age; and so it earns your respect.  <br />Here is a human story, about age and loss, youth and finding a way; and the preservation of an ancient way of life by allowing traditions to change and adapt.  In structure it's a fairy tale.  Koro, an elder of the Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti people, a Maori tribal group on the beautiful and isolated East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand, is concerned that younger leaders should be appearing.  But his own two sons have rejected that path; one to become an amiable dope-smoker with nothing in the way of ambition, the other to leave his home and people to make a career as an artist in Germany.  <br />His only mokopuna, or younger descendent, is his granddaughter Pai.  Pai shows over and again that she meets allthe ancient tests of leadership, but Koro cannot see it, because she doesn't meet one of his criteria: she is a girl.  <br />The story is predictable, in its way, as any European tale about a younger son who becomes a clever tailor and marries the princess.  It's not Pai's eventual ascension to her rightful place that fascinates and involves, but the process; her own understanding that she has more to give than she knew, and that she has a duty to give it, and the slow realisation of those around her that she is someone special.  And the pain, on both sides, caused by her grandfather Koro's failure to see what he needs to see, the truth that stares him in the face.  <br />The pain the child and the old (not very old) man cause each other is intense, and sometimes unbearably moving to watch.  One scene where Pai makes a speech in honour of her grandfather Koro at a school cultural night, and realises that Koro refuses to come to listen to her, will certainly have you in tears, and the people around you. And yet this emotion comes naturally from the characters, who have earned your sympathy. There is no shallow Spielbergian audience-manipulation here. <br />But Pai also hurts Koro.  The chief of Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti should have the power to call the whales, who have an ancient relationship with the Whangara people, whose ancestor Paikea rode to New Zealand on a whale.  And Koro is driven in despair to calling on the whales, only to have his despair deepen with the realisation that he cannot make the whales answer.  But when Pai calls, and the whales come, she only brings disaster; they beach themselves, and even with the efforts of the whole people to rescue them and return them to the sea, some of them die.  The arrival of the whales is a remarkable scene, involving computer imaging every bit as remarkable, but more subtle, as that in _Lord of the Rings_.  <br />The acting in this film is extraordinary; veteran actor Rawiri Paratane dominates the screen as Koro, a tough and uncompromising character who is very easy to hate.  But at the same time Paratene lets us know that Koro loves his granddaughter Pai, and that some of his toughness is because he believes it is in the interest of his people's future.  While 11-year old Keisha Castle-Hughes, as Pai, doesn't just dominate the screen; she lights it up.  Many superlatives have been directed at Castle-Hughes' performance, as a first-time actor.  She deserves all of them.  The rest of the cast are also superb, especially Cliff Curtis as Pai's father, who has abandoned much, though not all, of his Maori heritage, and Vicki Haughton as Pai's grandmother, Koro's wife, who heroically puts up with (mostly) Koro's stubborn blindness.  The other performances are also spot on, especially the non-actors. A highlight is the trio of older women, who make a splendidly rude joke about Pai's idealistic insistence that smoking is \\"bad for their womanly properties\\". The film is often very funny, sometimes quite earthy.   <br />Director Nicki Caro makes an impressive debut.  The score by Lisa Gerrard is another highlight.  I should also give credit to New Zealand, not only for its wild beauty, but for being a part of the world where indigenous people and newer arrivals have fought but also forged a way of living together, one that may be unique. There are things about the telling of this story, in the cooperation of the film crew and the people of Whangara, that have almost as much emotional resonance as the story on the screen.  New Zealanders have taken this film to their hearts because it says something about the people they are, and they're proud of that.  They're quite right to be.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon
0345410025|5.0|If I were to recommend a book for getting a great introduction to increasing memory, I would recommend this book. A classic in the field. In this book are techniques for memorizing numbers, faces, learning music, absentmindedness, sports, stock market, reading, speeches, long-digit numbers, playing cards, appointments, weekly/monthly mind calendars, and more.<br />All these techniques do work. Although, having tried many of these techniques there are newer improvements to be seen elsewhere, mostly in newer memory books. However, the amount of techniques, and Harry's ways for using them are tried-and-tested, creative, and do work! Kudos Harry for your many memory books!<br />Why I like about memory books is they should be proactive. I merely try the techniques and see if they work, and that is what I have done with many memory books. That is why I do like this classic book. Although some of the techniques have been improved upon now, this does not degrade this book; I see it as an improvement upon it. What I like about this book is the everyday use of Harry's techniques. He shows how he has used them in everyday use. He doesn't give much memory theory behind them he just basically explains and then shows the techniques for how they apply to everyday life.<br />One of the improvement areas would be Harry's technique for remembering numbers; it's called the Phonetic System. This outdated system is now replaced with merely associating every number with your own picture, for example mine are: 00 = bicycle, 3 = camel, 89 = confetti, etc.<br />But most of the other techniques in the book are tested and very valuable. Harry's chapter 23 on reading is a fine one, rather short but to the point. Harry walks us through a short paragraph of Tanzam Railway in Zambia, and shows us how he uses vivid pictures linking the different sentences, and words together. A rather slow approach at first visualizing almost every word. I have discovered newer research, and with my own practice you can visualize vividly and read logically at the same time, akin to left and right brain reading at the same time. Other books have mentioned this type of reading. Harry does not seem to employ speed reading of any sort, (or even recommend it) I would imagine speed reading and Harry's style can be used together. I personally see no conflict here.<br />Harry's example in his reading chapter (23) does work, I would recommend trying it for yourself. Also Harry states in the chapter: \\"the first few times you apply the systems to technical reading material, they will slow down your reading rate. On the other hand, you won't have to spend time going over the material again and again. And as you apply the system, you see that you'll eventually be reading close to your normal reading speed--and reading the material only once. And as your proficiency increases, so will your \\"normal\\" reading speed.<br />Harry's chapter 22: Music for beginners is another nice chapter. I always say \\"Why didn't I think of that\\" because of the simplicity of the technique. After reading the chapter, you may see learning music completely different, and very easy too. Why wasn't I taught this way? Harry's later chapters are built upon some of his opening chapters because of the techniques he specifically uses. Harry's beginning techniques are used in later chapters.<br />Learning Foreign languages seems to be one of Harry's strong points as well. He uses a substitute word game to link foreign words to words you already know. An outstanding technique for learning languages. In His video (below) he also shows this method.<br />If interested in learning languages please check out the rather unknown author Michael Gruneberg, books: \\"Spanish by Association, or \\"French by Association.\\" Audio & book series. The same association techniques Harry Lorayne uses are used in \\"Spanish by Association\\". I have used the audio version of \\"Spanish by Association\\" with tremendous effectiveness. HIGHLY recommended.<br/>Harry also has a very good, but scarce video called \\"Memory power: secrets to remembering names & faces\\". A lengthy video where Harry talks about memory systems and shows off his prowess as a user of them. The video is mainly about remembering names & faces but other areas are talked about. I find this video a great refresher course when I need to brush up on my PEG. Harry also talks about foreign languages and gives some examples. Highly recommended video, but not highly available.<br />Well a lot more could be said but that's about it for me. I do recommend other memory books before reading The Memory Book, but Harry's book is very useful and full of techniques, and is up in my Top 4 or 5 of suggested reading for memory books. A classic, and what a price! :-)
1558908374|5.0|This is a live action movie for the 1961 animated movie with the same expect for the animated movie was titled One Hundred and One Dalmatians. This one is title 101 Dalmatians, which makes it easy to write. The first ran about 80 minutes, and this one runs about 103 minutes. In the animated movie, Curuella De Vil and Anita were school mates, and here Cruella DeVille is Anita's boss. In the animated movie Roger worked as a songwriter, but in this movie, he is a video game disigner, who can't win the approval of a boy (Zohren Weiss), and he can't come up with a good villian for his games. As the movie opens, we meet Roger (Jeff Dianels), and his dalmatian Pongo, who takes walks around London. And we meet Anita (Joelyn Richardson) who works as a fashion designer for Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close). Cruella De Vil asks Anita to step in her office, and makes one change to Anita's drawing, to create a fur coat, and amits that she loves and lives for fur. One day Roger is out on a walk with Pongo, and all of a sudden, he finds another dalmatian and falls in love with this dalamtian. And he keeps running so fast, until he loses his owner, and the bike crashes into a park bench, which causes Roger to go falling into a pond. When he gets out, he goes off looking for Pogno, and mistakes Anita's dog for her own, (Anita's dog is calle Percy), they meet, and all a sudden, Anita ends up heaving her dog chaing after Pondgo, and she ends up into the pond, and wet like Roger. They go to Roger's house, where they discover a problem, their dogs has fallen in love, and both will be heart broken, when Anita and her dogs has to leave, and meaning to ask Anita if she would like another cup of tea, he says &quot;Would you like another cup of marriage?&quot; And before you know, they become husband a wife.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've always loved music. Up until the day i bought &quot;Lateralus&quot; i thought i had a pretty good concept of music in a formal kind of way. This cd just blew me away. Its so good i honestly cant say enough about it. It took every thing i liked, intoduced me to a whole lot more i never knew about and put it all together et VOILA!! You have Lateralus. This album has so much depth you'll never tire of it. There's always something to go back and find or even re-discover. I bought this cd on the strength of a reveiw. I'd never heard Tool before and if YOU haven't then buy this album NOW! I promise you'll never regret it and if you do i will happily get into any argument that you might have.
B00005ALNQ|4.0|I think this is one of Gere's overlooked films.  He is very athletic and agile in this movie.  The only thing he could've improved was his English accent, which tended to wax and wane throughout the movie.  He was far better in this than Kevin Costner was playing Robin Hood with a midwest accent.  Another good Gere historical movie was Somersby with Jodie Foster.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Well, most of the world is still waiting for this classic trilogy to be released on DVD, and will likely be waiting for a few more years.  Until then, we have to content ourselves with this VHS Special Edition release.  The DVD release will mark my 4th purchase of the trilogy, and I have to admit that I don't regret buying these movies 3 times already one bit.  They are just that good.<br />This epic tale of the saga between good and evil is every bit as entertaining as it was 25 years ago, though the new added scenes (for the most part) have not improved the films much.  Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and especially Yoda and Darth Vader have become household names thanks to this great trilogy.  As far as epic scope and storytelling grandeur, there are few movies that can rival the Star Wars trilogy.<br />George Lucas forever revolutionized the film industry with his release of Star Wars: a New Hope (in 1977).  Every so often, a film is released that forever changes the world of cinema, and Star Wars was such a film.  This movie, along with its sequels The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (all 3 included in this release), was very deservant of all the credit it received.  Say what you will about the new films--there are very few people who don't have a special place in their hearts for the original Star Wars trilogy.
B000002TQV|5.0|the bends is the kind of album that i can listen from start to finish, and if you knew me, that's quite an accomplishment. The Bends was the album after the mega hit \\"Creep\\" from 1993's Pablo Honey. Most RH fans will agree with me when I say that The Bends is light years ahead of Pablo Honey. My friend underrates this album so much because there isn't as much experimentation as the later albums so he dismisses it. Well, it really doesn't matter because the songwriting is just as brilliant as the later albums imho, and I'm not the kind of Radiohead fan that likes only some RH, I like it ALL with the exception of Pablo Honey because it was before they found their niche. Buy The Bends. Despite of what my friend says, you will not be even close to disappointed.
0790733226|5.0|I loved this movie, because it made me think. Jodie Foster is great to watch and Matthew McConaughey does some of his better acting, in my opinion.<br />The true sci/fi buffs seem to not like this movie, but I found it an enjoyable experience. It made my family think and that's a true sign of quality entertainment!
0684857219|4.0|Arnold deserves full credit for his career, bodybuilding and movies. This book is great inspiration and instruction based on what Arnold did to become the best. He writes as though if you do the work you too can achieve, very positive and motivating.<br />However following his routines will not really be suitable for those not genetically gifted, as he was (by his own admition). Also the exercise section needs more explaination for proper form, and some of the exercises are quite bad for your body (eg squats with heels raised).<br />Yes read/buy it, but also read other sources for more info on what will work for you. Books by Stuart McRobert are a must for any trainee.

IT HAS TO GROW ON YOU.

0446605409|5.0|Nelson DeMille is the only author in America whose work I will buy in hardback sight unseen. He is the only author whose work I will read over and over again and seemingly enjoy more each time. This one has it all: DeMille's alter-ego engaging wit in the flesh of detective John Corey and a tremendous plot that involves murder, a fascinating treasure hunt that dredges up the history of Captain Kidd and a very plausible end-of-the-world terrorist scenario. DeMille also creates some of the best villains in fiction. I can't decide who I wanted to dismember more: Frederick Tobin or Paul Stevens. This is absolutely a great read that was funny, engaging, suspensful and ended up being a great history lesson along the way. Take it on vacation and you may not want to leave the room.
B00008BRB5|5.0|The Police's fifth, last and best album.  Every Police album surpassed the previous, until they reached their pinnacle - Synchronicity.  <br />On their early albums they sometimes tried to be too clever with the lyrics, ending up coming across as pretentious, while the music was good, but sometimes just didn't seem to flow properly.  \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", their fourth album, is the first album where they got it all together, and Synchronicity builds on this.  That said, their first three albums were not bad at all, all worthy of at least three stars, and perhaps even four.<br />Synchronicity strikes the perfect balance: tight yet creative, finely crafted, yet with enough rawness to not feel over-produced.  Andy Summers' guitaring was never as silky and crafted, Stewart Copeland's drumming never as powerful, or timing as efficient.  Sting's bass was just perfect - pronounced and confident, yet not overbearing.  His vocals were superb, as always.<br />The radio-hits \\"Every breath you take\\", \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Wrapped around your finger\\" are clearly great songs, the former especially, but the hidden gem is \\"Synchronicity I\\".  \\"Walking in your footsteps\\" is another great and under-rated Police track.<br />It was ironic that relations between the band members were at their worst during the making of this album, if the documentaries are to be believed.  They seemed to get better the more they fought!  Maybe the duress brought out the best in them, like when Fleetwood Mac made Rumours.<br />Sad to consider that this was their last album, just when they hit their peak.  Imagine the music they would have made if they could have stayed together for a few more years...well, we'll never know.  Especially as Sting's solo stuff is no indication of what might have been, being rather boring and pretentious and falling well short of The Police in quality.
0688163173|1.0|Have read all of Lehane's stuff - this one was baddd !!!! Surprised his publisher went ahead with the project. Will think more than twice before buying his next one.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I went into seeing this movie with a poor attitude, considering that most movie they claim now a days, funny, are really poor in plot and usually never make me laugh. I found this movie to be funny and had me rolling on the floor a couple of times, I would recommend this to people that are sick of funny movies, not being so funny afterall.
B00005JMC6|5.0|This was the best film at the 2003 Seattle Film Festival, and very deserving of the award.  You will feel magic, inspiration and beauty all at once.  This is one film that will trespass your conscience, your being, and your heart.  You don't realize it as you're watching it, but in the end, you will be glad that it did.
B000060P79|4.0|Every so often a band comes along with a debut album that's better than expected.  Simple Plan's &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; is one of those albums.  Despite the somewhat juvenile lyrics, the songs on this album are filled with catchy melodies, great guitar riffs, and surpisingly harmonious vocals.<br />Simple Plan makes two things very clear on this album.  One is that they are young kids writing about what it's like to be young kids.  The second is that they are a guitar band, as evidenced by the layers upon layers of guitars featured on nearly every track.  It says a lot about a band when they can make a debut album that sounds raw and unpolished.  It says even more when this raw and unpolished sound works.<br />Adults might have a hard time relating to the lyrics of many of the album's tracks.  &quot;One Day&quot; is a call for freedom from one's parents...being able to do what you want &quot;one day&quot;.  &quot;Perfect&quot;, an album highlight, is a somewhat dismal tune describing a strained relationship between a father and son.  The lyrics on this tune are surprisingly insightful, however, and the melodic chorus further enhances this track.  Other songs like &quot;Grow Up&quot; and &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; also express juvenile sentiments, while &quot;My Alien&quot; is a comical song about dating an alien who's &quot;not your typical girlfriend&quot;.  <br />Adults will best be able to relate to the songs that deal with desire and heartache.  &quot;Addicted&quot;, one of the album's best tracks, is about trying to overcome someone you're addicted to.  This song has been receiving a decent amount of radio airplay, and rightfully so.  The soaring chorus and intense guitar riffs make this track seem head and shoulders above conventional, sappy &quot;power ballads&quot;.  &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; is another catchy tune about longing for that special someone.<br />Simple Plan has managed to create a debut album from which many establishedbands could take a lesson.  In an era of overproduced albums, it's refreshing to see a new band release a pure guitar pop album that doesn't sound like it's been reworked 100 times to get that &quot;special sound&quot;.  The members of Simple Plan aren't pretending to be something they're not...they're just singing about what they feel as young men growing up in today's society.  In doing so they have created one of the best debut albums in recent years.
B00005JLTR|3.0|Considering her reputation as a perfectionist, I'm surprised that Streisand let the many mistakes in this film get past her. Fans who have the soundtrack will catch how Streisand messes up the lyrics in the finale, but presses on anyway. In the scene where she wrestles in the mud with Kris (in her expensive white outfit), she has mud on the back of her outfit before they even get down in the dirt.  Jon Peters is shown in the background of one of the concert scenes. And the \\"concert tour\\" takes place almost entirely on the same stage - at least she changed outfits a few times.<br />All in all, I still enjoy this movie once in a while. It reminds me of how over-the-top the 1970's were.
0066214122|1.0|By this stage anyone who picks up a Crichton novel should be well prepared for the formula: new technology full of hope & promise, unprincipled scientists/techno-freaks out to make a buck regardless of risk, ponderous hero who always intuits that \\"something isn't quite right here\\", technology runs amok, scary chase scene, hero wins out in spite of all odds, cautionary message bashing science & technology in wrap-up. I don't mind formulas when I am looking for an escapist novel & in the past Crichton has managed to throw in enough character development & believable science to keep me reading. Alas, PREY seems to have been written on the back of an airline safety card while stuck in a holding pattern over San Jose.  The characters are tissue thin, the dialog is unbelievable, and even the monster (a cloud of self-programming nano-particles that are supposed to be the Pentagon's next super spy camera but of course have ideas of their own) fails to grab our attention. I suppose that I should be grateful that we are spared much of the pseudo-philosophizing & gratuitous chaos-theory invocations that kept creeping into Crichton's 90's novels (we do get gratuitous fractals in PREY, but they are blessedly less obvious) but he still hates science & scientists & perhaps it is time to look for other villains? The pity is that nano-technology and self-organizing computer networks are indeed exciting & potentially scary new frontiers in technology & I feel that Crichton COULD have made an excellent novel around them (witness for instance his still provocative book on psycho-surgery: TERMINAL MAN, which even a quarter of a century later makes one pause & ponder. Here he simply doesn't have his mind on the job & resorts to what amount to B-horror movie cliches in place of real character or situation development. Ugh.
B000068TPN|2.0|i saw we were soldiers once - forgot about it within 10 min - never saw it again. BORING WAR MOVIE. saving private ryan and full metal jacket were way better than this one.
B00006HBUA|1.0|I took my kids to see this movie thinking that it's PG and it's Scooby so it should be alright. OH MAN, WAS I WRONG!!! I don't like the way the Sarah Michelle Gellar turned Dafney into Buffy. (She must have gotten her charactors confused.) I also detest the way that they made Scrappy Doo into a preverted foul mouthed villian. I was thoroughly disgusted with the part showing Scrappy Doo urinating on Dafney \\"marking his territory.\\" The list goes on and on and on of all the things I didn't like in this movie, but I'm limited on space. The only charactors that I liked were Shaggy and Vilma, Scooby's animation and voice could have been done much better.  Overall I don't recommend this movie for children of any age and recommend it only for adults with a sick sense of humor.
B00003CXZ3|3.0|they decide to reverse everything and make a story that goes backwards and all of a sudden its a masterpiece? the story was interesting and had me anxious to see what was going to happen next because i was hoping to expect a better ending than what it was- the ending was a disapointment and the repetition of all the scenes was annoying. the people on here said ( u have to watch it a few times to really to get ) - trust me ive had enough - i understood it first time and i dont think i can sit through another 2 plus hours of watching him do same thing over n over again . i give it 3 stars because some parts were good and the concept was interesting. it was as if they put u in his shoes and u had to figure out the story yourself - but like i said the repetition was tolerable for the first 45 min then it got old and annoying but still i was interested in following the story so i could see what happened at the end but in the last 25 min of the film i just wanted it to end and like i said i wasnt happy with the ending - didnt think it was anything great. ok movie to have in collection and i might watch it again .
B000092ZYY|5.0|I foolishly, hastily reviewed this the day it came out, after one listen, and thought it dreadful at the time. Well, how wrong was I...This is an outstanding collection of music. Fourteen songs in all (56 minutes), and only one (The Gloaming- the shortest song on the cd) is less than captivating. The remainder represent Radiohead pulling together and drawing on all their strengths. Each song is distinct, the sounds/melodies/song structures rather varied. Backdrifts, Go to Sleep, A Wolf at the Door are personal favorites; and this collection of songs is so, so deep, that There There (the first single) appears as just another song. It's hard to imagine, as others have written here, that if you started to listen to Radiohead @ OK Computer, and have liked what they've done since then, that you can't but like what they've just released. Absolutely essential listening- these guys are on some roll...finally, this cd has Copy Control technology which prevents one from burning a copy of it, as well as making a copy onto a cassette (believe it or not).
B000021YQV|5.0|After most of the day pounding Avril Lavigne and the Backstreet Boys on other reviews, I come upon one of my personal favorite bands: SOAD.  Not only to they exhibit the randomness appropriate in good metal, but they make enough since to make yourself think too hard about the song.  Songs like \\"Bounce\\" if not thought about is just another random song.  If thought about it is a funny song making fun of group orgies.  Songs like \\"Science\\" are abviously poking fun at those stupid scientists that think they can explain everything.  Though they are anything but a Christian group, they have the dignity to put actual Biblical references in their song Chop Suey.  Their final song, Aerials, when thought about is obvious that it is talking about how fame is easily gained but more easily lost, shown more in the music video.  I only gave SOAD a 5 just cuz Amazon won't let you put 10.
B000001GOZ|5.0|Just by listening to the first few bars of the first movement and one feels that Boulez really knows what he's doing with this symphony! The sheer strength and passion of this performance is evident since the very beginning! Boulez attention to detail reminded me of Klemperer's in Mahler's second, and I love it!<br />The Wiener Philharmoniker sounds amazing, playing beautifully thru every movement of this symphony! The wind section is awesome!<br />I own Szell's version too, and I also love the way he conducts this work, but it was always frustrating for me to hear the evidence that that was a live recording, especially at some rather crucial slow, quiet moments. In Boulez version this just doesn't happen since it is not a live recording, thus the power of both loud and quiet moments is never marred by unwanted sounds!<br />To put it simply: I love this performance!!!
B00005YTFG|5.0|I have to say first, My mom and dad saw the movie first , and they really didn't like it. I think it was because The music was more up to date like form David Bowie to \\" We can be heores\\", Also That Queen's song\\"The Show Must Go On\\". I have to say with all honestly ,I had to watch it on HBO more times then I can count. I fell in love with it. I had to go out and buy it. I have to rate this a 10. I love it!!!!! I bought the Special Edition Moulin Rouge DVD. Oh yes I didn't know that Nicole Kidman could sing, She made the movie worth watching, also Ewan McGregor was also A great singer The two of them just make the show. I just was she didn't die at the end!<BR>Melissa J. Lopez
B00005JLKB|4.0|\\"Smallville\\" is the teen drama that puts a new spin on the Superman mythology, following the adventures of a teenage Clark Kent as he discovers his roots and learns to hone his powers.  Lois Lane, the Daily Planet, and Metropolis are still off in the future for the budding Superman, but one-day nemesis Lex Luthor becomes a part of Clark's life early on when Clark saves him in the pilot episode and, in an interesting twist, the two become friends.  Although not yet a criminal mastermind, Lex's darker tendencies do surface from time to time, showing us the gradual progression toward his destiny.  Also along for the ride is Lana Lang, Clark's high school crush, and parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider of \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\" and Annette O' Toole, who played a grown-up Lana in \\"Superman III\\").<br />The pilot episode dazzles with a look at Clark's arrival on Earth in the midst of a meteor shower.  (The meteors, of course, are laden with Kryptonite, which can not only hurt Clark but also have some unexpected results on the people of Smallville.)  After the pilot, though, the show is hit-and-miss for most of season one with a lot of episodes taking on an \\"X-Files\\" vein, featuring a different Kryptonite-produced \\"freak\\" every weak with little emphasis on developing Clark's story (a mistake that wasn't repeated so grievously in season two).  Still, \\"Smallville\\" happily marries sci-fi, teen angst, and a comic book legend in a clever show that often packs an emotional wallop and mixes in hip new music in a way that isn't contrived but, instead, adds to the experience.<br />In short, it's a show that's definitely worth checking out.  If you do purchase the season one DVD set and are a little disappointed by some of the episodes, take comfort in the knowledge that the show really doesn't find its footing until season two.
B00009V7RF|5.0|The new Black Eyed Peas album is probably one of the best albums to come out this year. It's also one of the funkiest albums that you can listen to over and over again and have a ball. It contains some of the funkiest and energetic songs I've heard in quite some time. Besides the powerful first single Where is the Love? featuring Justin Timberlake, there are numerous tracks worth mentioning. Most notably the party anthem of the year Let's Get Retarded, Smells Like Funk which sounds like it has a sample of Puttin on the Ritz. The best tracks are left to the newest member of BEP, Stacy \\"Fergie\\" Ferguson. Her stunning, soulful, and powerful vocals bring each track to life. Such as Shut Up and the best song on the album, her solo effort Fly Away. This girl has got the goods and she needs to have a solo album soon!

0385495323|4.0|I haven't read all this book, just the chapter on linear b.  After having read the other two books on the decipherment of linear b, I thought this book added something and clarified some things.  It made it clear for me finally, how the chart of symbols which appeared to share consonants or vowels was begun and developed, and then how the initial foray into actual translation with names of towns unlocked the power of the chart.  Each book on this story has its own value, including this one.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix, without a doubt, is one of the most amazing films out to this day.  While some might view it no more than a cool comic book adaptation, it is much more than that.  The Matrix taps into some of the most difficult questions of existence such as pleasure vs. morality, reality vs. perception.  It is a grandiose twist of the idea of dream skepticism, which aims to entertain wast audience appealing to teens as well as adults.  The Matrix has already became part of our (Western) culture.  I have heard many of my friends refer to the Matrix while talking about unrelated ideas.  This great film will be remembered for a long time.
B000002O51|5.0|Boston's stellar debut album may have overshadowed their subsequent work, but Third Stage is truly a magnificent album and one of the greatest &quot;concept&quot; albums of all time.<br />Much of this CD is softer than Boston's previous efforts but it's still definitely hardcore rock 'n' roll.  &quot;Amanda&quot; is easily one of the best rock ballads of all-time.  The songs flow beautifully and the album's concept is epitomized in the spectacular instrumental &quot;The Launch&quot; and the smooth segue into &quot;Cool the Engines&quot;.<br />My personal favorite on the album is the energetic and uplifting, but often overlooked &quot;I Think I Like It&quot;.<br />Boston's music is a rising, thrusting, spiritual uplifting - befitting the great Ayn Rand heroes Howard Roark and John Galt.  And &quot;Third Stage&quot; is perhaps Boston's best work.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Animatrix is a welcome twist in the Matrix series.  Those of us who are the true fans of Matrix world will find this series of episodes to be a creative elaboration on the concept of the Matrix universe.  It could also be a device used by Warchovski's to keep our hunger to see Matrix Revolutions at bay.<br />  While some episodes are free standing, Kid's Story and Final Flight of Osiris are intimately linked to the events of the Matrix: Reloaded.  Those of us who loved the Matrix have to admit; the idea of machines creating an artificial reality is a great one.  Warchowski's were not the first ones to come up with the idea of dream skepticism but their execution of it makes for a fascinating concept. <br /> The idea of the Matrix is filled with mystery, danger, fear, and much of unknown and unexplored.  <BR>The use of the animation was a great idea to address some of the plot holes of the Matrix series as well as to create more entertainment for those of us who want to see Matrix without Keanu Revees.  What makes Animatrix a good DVD is that it incorporates nine wholly different stories and styles of presentation.  While some will dislike particular episode or episodes most of us will walk away with at least one element or a story as profoundly touching.  In other words, you might not like all, but at least something here.<br />    Two episodes in the Animatrix are especially worthy of note. They are Matriculated and Program.  Even though both of these episodes do not seem to appeal to general liking they are particularly profound and entertaining.  Matriculated is very abstract piece and unlike some other episodes its message is not spoon feed directly to the audience.  The visual imagery was stunning and memorable and was intended to make us come up with our own interpretations of what seemed bizarre.  Perhaps Matriculated yields a hint at what will happen in Matrix Revolutions.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I got the Lord of the Rings: FotR Platinum Series Extended Edition. It is just awesome. All of the extra footage really helps with the story line. It helps slow things down so they're easier to understand for those who haven't read the books. Plus, the extras helps you understand the work that went into making these great movies. They did a great job of converting these great books into movies. Of course it's not going to be exactly like the books. Movies never are... ever. So anyway, I look forward to getting this edition of the DVD. My family is already bent on buying the regular edition of it so I'll be able to see the extras in that as well as this one. I can't wait until November! (Not to mention December when The Return of the King comes to theaters!)
0156027321|5.0|Martell's wonderful book is equally enjoyable as a robust survivor story as it is a metaphor for religious suspension of disbelief. The concise chapters - 21,22 particularly but all of them ultimately - bend this simple tale into a glorious ride across the Pacific. Water imagery abounds, and is perhaps the only slightly forced aspect of the book, but hell, the story involves a kid on a boat at sea, so we'll forgive Martell for this. In fact, there is significance in almost everything: the culinary references, the town of Pondicherry, Pi Patel's own name and its various forms, the stories both real and invented, and the individual animals and their characteristics. This is a deceptively rich text, and you'll probably only realise this at the end, when you'll sit where you are for a few minutes and contemplate your perception of the world, God, truth and fiction. A worthy winner of the Booker, and an author to watch in the future.
B00004SAIQ|5.0|I have owned about 8 versions of this ranging from 2 cassettes to 2 LPs and one CD.  It is literally a masterpiece!
0316666343|5.0|The lovely bones is one of the best books i have ever read. Its descriptions and portrayals of life are awesome. At the end of the book i was literally left speechless. Even after i finished the book i couldnt stop reading it. Everything i saw would remind me of the book and i was constantly thinking about it. I loved this book!
B00001U0DP|5.0|Contrary to what all the hullabaloo was about concerning the degradation of the Holocaust that many people accused Roberto Begnini of, this movie is simply a touching story about a man and his son trying to survive the Holocaust.  Roberto's character, Guido, is taken along with his son Giusue to Auschwitz on what happens to be Giusue's 5th birthday.  Because the boy is so young, Guido makes every effort to try to hide the real horrors of their experience from Giusue by telling him it's all a game and everyone gets points for doing things.  He then goes on to tell the boy that the first person to get 1,000 points wins the game and gets a real tank as first prize.  This helps Giusue cope to a point, because Guido has to keep the story about the game going.  The movie is a real tear-jerker, but it has lighter scenes to help it seem not so completely depressing.  The concentration camp scenes were actually filmed at Auschwitz.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see Roberto Begnini at his pinnacle.
B00005QFE5|5.0|THE ROAD HOME is one of the  best movies I have seen in a long time!  It is about a village girl who falls in love with a school teacher in the days of arranged marriages.  Then he gets taken away by the government.  My brief synopsis doesn't do the movie justice though.  Don't let it deter you from buying this film!<br />THE ROAD HOME is such a beautiful love story, but a tear-jerker, so some guys may not like it.  However, it is clean enough for the whole family.  Definitely a \\"Girls' Night Out\\" film, though.  My friends love it and we're planning to watch it again during our next get together.  I highly reccommend it!!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Well, this, the second album by Jack Johnson, is just as fun as the first. He's back with his beutiful guitar and voice and he has no trouble making you relax. This CD(along with his first) make me think of summer when ever I listen to it, and when it is summer, it feels like paradise. I think this is a must buy for people who liked his first CD, or people who are fans of Ben Harper. <BR>P.S. The album cover looks wicked!
B00009TB5G|5.0|A truly remarkable achievement. As both a Lord Of The Rings purist and a fan of the movies, the extra features on this DVD are well worth investigating. For the sceptics out there who have yet to be convinced about the incredible achievement of transferring the book into movie format, this DVD may not convice you entirely, but it will certainly open your eyes to immense amount of work involved in the process.<br />Whilst the 30 minutes added onto the 'Fellowship - Extended Edition' may have left you feeling a little starved of exciting extra footage, the 43 minutes added to 'The Two Towers' brings a new dimension to the movie.<br />One to satisfy both the purist and the movie buff.
B000001E7L|5.0|I love this album!  This is my favorite &quot;Cranberries&quot; album; songs like &quot;Zombie&quot; and &quot;Ode to my Family&quot; make it timeless.  While many of my CD's have come and gone, most to the used CD store, this one has stayed.  This is classic Cranberries.  It will always have a place in my changer.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce's first solo effort is solid, individualistic and well produced. The single with Sean Paul, 'Baby Boy' could probably grow on you but it will not jump out and grab the way a 'collabo' between these two heavy hitters ought to. The other songs are mature and ought to appeal to a lot of people. She steers clear of the Bling nonsense that dominates a lot of her contemporaries' music. Which is good because her cover of 50's 'In Da Club' (Not on this CD) is all about clothes and spending. Dangerously in Love, however, is full of R&amp;B substance. 'Yes', and 'That's how you like it(feat. Jay Z)' stand out. Both are laid back tracks, that are really fresh.<BR>Her growth is more than apparent. The only knock I would put on this CD is that there isn't much that bumps here, by that I mean there are few party tracks on the CD but that is probably more intentional than mistake. There is a good share of excellent slow songs. Dangerously in Love is more than an R &amp; B CD which may trouble some of her core fans, but ought to earn her many more in the process. In short, get it!!
B000002H6C|4.0|Bob Rock molded these guys into shape in the late '80s, much like Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange did with Def Leppard.  I often wish that Mutt Lange would have produced an album in the '80s with Metallica, in fact, as I think the results would have been stupendous.  But Bob Rock did a good job on this one, much better than his lame work with Motley Crue.  Motley Crue stink, but these guys are the real fizzle on the dizzle - as Snoop Doggy Dogg would boast.  If it hadn't have been for Bob Rock, Metallica would have been just a bunch of nobody losers from San Francisco. <br />It's hard to argue with masterpieces like \\"One\\" and \\"To Live is to Die.\\"  Metallica created a symphony of metal on this record that hasn't been created before or since, except for a few Megadeath records.  Megadeath were probably a step above Metallica in terms of songwriting and showmanship, but what the hey.  On this album, Hetfield growls menacingly, the drums click, and the guitars wail with scary abandon - it's all here!!<br />Best of all, the boys from Metallica spout off about social injustice on this record, of which there was a lot of in 1988.  <br />You've heard the rest, but now it's time to check out the best.<br />Thanks....
B000099T2L|4.0|When I heard that Beyonce was doing a solo project, I just knew that it was going to be a bunch of mess.  Knew it in my heart.  <BR>  Imagine my surprise to hear this album.  Although very ballad-heavy, it is obvious that Beyonce still loves a great up-tempo beat (and the rock-feel of 'hip hop star').  Her collaborations with other artists (Missy, Jay-Z, Big Boi, Sean Paul, LUTHER!) are impressive and show a depth and maturity that you probably would not have imagined the young lady having.<BR>  Beyonce once said in an interview that she wanted to make the album seem timeless. Several of the tracks have a very 70's &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot; feel to them (Gift from Virgo), but she shows her range and talent throughout the album.  &quot;Baby Boy&quot; with Sean Paul will become a favorite easily.  Even if you dont like her lyrics (which, by the way, have come a long way from &quot;Bootylicious&quot;), you'll love her  ever-hypnotic beats.  <BR>  I am extremely impressed.  Beyonce clearly demonstrates her vocal and writing ability on this album.  This collection of songs will easily take you for a ride inside of her head--and heart.  Definitely worth looking into.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|This is a great collection but is missing 3 crucial songs: &quot;I don't Care Anymore,&quot; &quot;I Missed Again&quot; and &quot;Don't Lose My Number&quot; (most unfortunate since this is one of my favorite solo songs from him). Hopefully, a 2nd collection will eventually come out or they will release a 2-cd collection someday that corrects this problem.
B00007E8V4|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS JUST TOO GOOD FOR BEING A LEFTOVER SONGS ALBUM,HOW COULD THIS SONGS HAVE BEEN REJECTED? THEY'RE GREAT,EVERY SONG IS AMAZING AND WILL STICK INTO YOUR HEAD,MY FAVORITE IS &quot;HIGHWAY SONG&quot; WHICH IS ONE OF THE COOLEST SONG OF SYSTEM,THE CHORUS IS JUST WONDEFULLY AWESOME.<br />AFTER A WHILE MAYBE IT GETS OLD BUT IF U STOP LISTENING FOR A WHILE,YOU'LL FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT AGAIN,GET IT RIGHT NOW!
B00005JLIU|4.0|Julie Andrews.  Carol Channing.  Mary Tyler Moore.  Beatrice Lillie.  What a cast!<br />THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE (TMM) is a hoot.  Director George Roy Hill keeps the pace fast and the mood light.  He has Julie Andrews look into the camera often for funny effect.  Usually a silent movie card is flashed onscreen when she does this, telling the audience Millie's thoughts (&quot;Her beads hang straight.&quot;)<br />The characters are broadly drawn, which makes the movie fun.  Beatrice Lillie is the arch-villainess, and her severe makeup and beehive hairdo are hilarious.  Mary Tyler Moore strikes the right chord as the virginal Miss Dorothy.<br />There are several highlights for me: The opening number when Millie changes from 'plain Jane' to 'thoroughly modern'; any time a character has to dance in the tempermental elevator to make it go up or down; &quot;Jazz Baby&quot; with Carol Channing.<br />About the disc:  The print of TMM doesn't look that good.  The movie was released in 1967, so it's over 35 years old.  Some of the special-effects shots (even the wipes and transition scenes) look grainy.  The colors could be more vibrant.  This is probably the best print in existence, still one wishes the quality were better.  The sound tended to 'peak' in sections too.<br />TMM fans will be happy to know that the overture and intermission music have been restored.<br />TMM is a funny, entertaining, old-fashioned film with great performances.  Julie Andrews seems to be having a great time vamping it up.  Enjoy it!
B000060P79|3.0|Some of the songs (read, the singles, and a couple others) rock, but the others are slightly disappointing and it's tough to stick out the full cd without getting bored
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce has proven that she is a super star.  This was a great project and it shows her talents as a singer, writer, and producer. This is a definite must have. This is a joint that you can put in and let it play straight through.  GO GET IT.
1573228737|2.0|I suppose the problem is that &quot;Fingersmith&quot; was such an incredible book, I was expecting the same from &quot;Affinity.&quot; It just isn't as good a book, and could have used some massive editing. The story was fascinating, but the ending seemed tacked on and artificial.
B000002H97|5.0|This is metallica's best album...that is, besides \\"master of puppets\\"...it displays pure genius when it comes to heavy, powerful kick-butt speed metal!  No matter how old this album gets, it will continue to live on as one of the best in history of music.  If you like rock, metal, or even punk music i guarantee you will love this cd.  They are my favorite band and will continue to be so even though their new album is nu-metal.  The solos can't get better and all of the instruments flow perfectly together.  As a musician, i rate this album 5 stars, and if you like it you should check out Leigh Williams!! (LEIGH WILLIAMS, ABSOLUTE ZERO <--check out his web site!)  you should also check out \\"master of puppets\\"...masterpiece!!
B000002L7R|4.0|His psychedelic album! And it's a good one. Has the standouts &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; and &quot;Pop Life&quot;, plus the gospel-influenced &quot;The Ladder&quot;, and &quot;Temptation&quot;, featuring a conversation between Prince and God himself. It's a good album, with great songs, and it's worth checking out, even if it is weak in spots.
B00008S2VG|3.0|If you can get past a few jarring electronic head-scratchers (\\"I'm So Stupid\\", \\"X-Static Process\\"), American Life actually turns out to be an OK album. Not her best work, but certainly not her worst either. While the album misfires immediately with the aggressively cynical title track (with a taunting rap), it recovers with a handful of songs that are catchy, melodic, and introspective -- the Madonna songs that most of us favor. \\"Hollywood\\" jaunts enticingly through the dangers of fame, while \\"Love Profusion\\" explores the mysteries of an all-consuming passion. The songs about hope and salvation work out the best and humanize the cold wall of production that overpowers much of this body of work. The gospel-flavored \\"Nothing Fails\\" (with choir in tow) is empowering, while the acoustic \\"Intervention\\" offers unconditional love and support. The only track on the album, however, recalling the artist's old school influences that inspired classics \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" is the groovy \\"Mother and Father,\\" which boasts a memorable bass line.
B000002KLP|5.0|An early Prince masterpiece, setting the stage for the many great albums to come. Has the classics \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"When U Were Mine\\", but is great the whole way through. Must Buy!
B0000714B5|5.0|Conrad Rooks makes a sincere effort to adapt the Herman Hesse classic to screen and succeeds to a great extent.  He pays much attention to Hesse's story and avoids taking away its soul.<br />Siddhartha, a Brahmin's son leaves home in search of himself. He joins the sadhus and is not content, he meets the Buddha but even the great teacher cannot quench his thirst, he crosses the river to find Kamala, a beautiful courtesan. While his life as an ascetic is one extreme, his life with Kamala is another.  Still discontent he crosses back the river to find the answers long evading him, by the banks of it.<br />The story is set in the time of Buddha so best efforts are made to keep the setting authentic. The camera captures the landscape of India in its true form as Siddhartha travels with the sadhus.<br />Rooks employed well known film stars of Indian cinema in his movie.  Shashi Kapoor as Siddhartha and Simi Grewal as Kamala put in a sincere performances.  They both look the part.<br />Although many emotions are lost in the transition of a book to a film, this movie is an honest attempt of the filmmaker to translate the classic to this medium.
B000005H7D|5.0|This album never gets old.  This was one of the first jazz cd's I got when I started into jazz many years ago and the music is still as powerful everytime I listen to it.  The musician line up is amazing and the music really gets you moving.  A great cd to start out with if you are just getting into jazz.
B00005JM03|5.0|Gripping presentation, tight plot, and fantastic artists make this movie a worthy watch.  It keeps you glued to your seats throughout.<br />Its payback time for Norton when he leaves his partners in crime for dead to be the sole reaper of the benefits. Wahlberg, the organizer, orchestrates a perfect plan to bring his hard earned (no, not really his) gold back into his own safe with the help of his very own safe cracker, Theron.<br />Edward Norton does a great job as the negative character.  Donald Sutherland makes his presence felt in his brief role.  Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron have chemistry. And the Mini Cooper steals the show.<br />All thriller fans and others, check it out.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the best cd purchase I have ever made. You know how some cd's you buy and a couple tracks are really good, but the rest just [...]. Not here. Every song is amazing. My favorite is Whisper. I absolutely love the song, and the latin (or whatever it is) at the end just adds to the haunting quality the song already has. Definitely check out this cd. It's well worth it.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is exactly what I expected from Beyonce's first solo attempt and more.  She really did it with this one.  From slow downtempo ballads to midtempo grooves to hard-hittin' bangers, she has the whole package here.  Her voice and lyrical content are right on the money.  Definitely a cd that can be played from beginning to end.
B00000K3G8|4.0|Nitpicking first.  The packaging on the disc indicates that it contains &quot;all the songs from the classic movie + seven previously unreleased tracks&quot;.  What should have been written is that the disc contains all of the songs from the original album (which by the way did not have much to do with the actual movie soundtrack except the songs had the same names - more about this later).  Not all of the songs on this disc are the same version that are part of the movie.  Having made a cassette tape from the movie soundtrack I recognize that the versions of &quot;Take Me To The River&quot; is different.  I could tell because there are no band intros on this new disc.  &quot;This Must Be The Place&quot; is missing a vital &quot;uh-huh&quot; by David Byrne.  Also, a few great songs are missing most notably a great version of &quot;Cities&quot;, &quot;Big Business&quot; and &quot;I Zimbra&quot;.  I don't understand why they did not make a two disc set and us gave the whole thing.  They also could have skipped the Tom Tom Club song as well.  I'm assuming that everyone already knows that the original album had songs with the same names but was not actually the soundtrack.  There were different versions of many of the songs probably from other nites of the Stop Making Sense Tour<br />That being said.  This is some great music.  From the opening to &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; (acoustic) to &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot;.  The Heads were a great band.  Listening (and singing along) brings back the images of one of the great concert movies ever made.  The entire band is at the top of their powers and David Byrne's circumlocutions (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean) come right through the disc.<br />Still, I wish they would have been more honest in their labeling.  That is the reason for four stars instead of five.
B000092ZYX|3.0|What is that I hear? A fake mellotron? xylophone? Warped out effects? Is this another progressive rock band scratching out a living trying to sound like a post-punk, alternative electronic culmination of Radiohead albums are rolled into one? <br />Of course not. Radiohead are \\"WAY\\" cooler than that. <br />There are a couple of songs that I really dig and thus the three star rating. Sail to the Moon which by the way sounds more like Progressive rock than Alternative Rock if you guys want to get really technical. Also Sit Down, Sit Up as well as Go to Sleep.<br />The rest of the album is ZERO. Just hypnotic trance music. I believe Depeche Mode and Magma have done this stuff in the past. If nobody is going to credit these bands, why should I praise Radiohead? <br />Let's not get carried away fellas. This is Radiohead cleverly saying they are something they are clearly not. As one reviewer put it, Paradoxical Pop. If that is how these guys should be praised, my mistake. <br />The real rock bands that can blow this band right out of the water is clearly Porcupine Tree and Opeth, not to mention a living breathing organism for over thirty years by the name of King Crimson. <br />It is \\"O.K.\\" Radiohead. As long as your sheep continue to follow, should you make interesting if not deceiving progressive rock...  <br />What about Porcupine Tree, Trans Am, Tortoise?
B00006BTCA|5.0|Everybody's comparing it to everything. Just shut up and listen. Best alternative stuff I've heard in eons. Wow.
B00004SZWD|5.0|It's now been over 27 years and I STILL want to hear this album! It's more poigant now then ever. Just one listen to \\"Love's in need of love today\\",and if that don't stir you, check your pulse! The whole album is one of joy, desperation, hope, love and eternal promise that mankind can still pull it off and get it together, if only mankind could \\"see\\" through the ... at what's really important. This album is among the top 5 in my collection of more than 800. Thank you Stevie Wonder.Check it out. You won't be sorry.
0684833395|5.0|I started Catch-22 3 times in my life.  2 of the times ended halfway through because life just wouldn't have it.  But finally i had the summer off and i decided, ok FIRST BOOK this summer will be Catch-22, i'm going to finish it if it kills me.  And i finally did.  It was absolutely amazing.  I saw my own world changing after reading the novel for two weeks.  The way i thought the way i talked, my views on what a coward and what a brave person is.  It was really great.  <br />Joseph Heller is absolutely a genius. He created a world, much like our own with it's own hypocracies and jaded/curupt leading figures.  And then there was Yossarian, I fell in love with him falling in love with every girl he laid eyes on.  His amiable persona and his great questions and ideas and etc.<br />Definately one of my favorite books now.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is what I LOVE about the Matrix: when you think you've got it all figured out, you'll read a review from someone else putting a whole new twist on the story, making you discover aspects of it you didn't quite catch before. I can personally spend hours happily reading all the reviews connected to any Matrix product, always fascinated at the power it has to make people think. As a fanatic of anything Matrix, I wanted to get this DVD even though I must state that I was not an anime fan to begin with and didn't expect to like all the material. Well, I was proven wrong.<br />True, not all 9 shorts are of equal quality, each one with its own animation and storytelling style. Whether you'll prefer one over the other really depends on your personal tastes. In my case, I have my favorites but must admit that each piece, even the ones which I feel are weaker, have some redeeming qualities which make up for their shortcomings.<br />\\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" is without a doubt my personal favorite. This story could easily have been a part of Reloaded but since that movie was quite long to begin with, it was a very good idea to include it here instead. From the creators of \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\\", the animation all in CGI is even better this time around, with a few years of technological progress. Some of the characters are so well done that they almost feel human, especially the male lead Thadeus. The story is erotic, chilling and moving at the same time. A must see.<br />\\"The second Renaissance Part I&II\\" is my second favorite with a backstory to how the machines have come to enslave humans. I love the new spin this has put on the story where we discover that the machines are not as totally evil as we had previously thought. Quite violent and disturbing with images that will stay with you for a long time afterwards. Not for the squirmish and definitely not for kids.<br />I also have to mention \\"Matriculated\\". I really loved it even though I saw that quite a few reviewers didn't seem to agree. It is the most abstract short here with a lot of psychedelic and very colorful imagery which is a big part of why I loved it. I also appreciated the reversal story where a robot is immerged into a virtual world created by the minds of several humans so they can entice him to join them in their resistance against the machines. The animation style was very much to my liking and I really loved the robot who ends becoming quite likable, therefore complicating the Matrix story even more, adding a very interesting spin to the mix.<br />\\"Program\\", \\"Beyond\\", \\"Kid's story\\" and \\"A Detective's story\\" are engaging as well with different animation styles and stories I liked in various degrees. Only \\"World Record\\" is, in my opinion, not as strong as the others and I found myself not really connecting to its very unusual animation technique nor its somewhat static plot, even though it is still worth seeing.<br />The extras are also noteworthy and I found myself captivated by the different directors and various crew members explaining how they came to craft these shorts with a lot of patience and dedication. Finally, for me the ultimate proof that this DVD is a must resides in the fact that after viewing it, I got the urge to seek out some classics in the Japanese Anime world, even though I really wasn't a big fan of it before. The Wachowsky brothers succeeded in my case to convert an anime neophyte into a fan. No small feat.<br />Any Matrix fan has got to see this. And remember, one element which is very important in the Matrix world is to retain the freedom to make up your own mind and form your own opinion. Don't let any negative reviews keep you from seeing this. And once you've watched, write a review and put your own spin on it!few reviewers didn't seem to agree.

B000099T2L|3.0|It's a mixture of hip-hop beats and really awesome slow jams. My definite favourite (as from the moment I first heard it) is 'Be with you' and has a 70's feel to it and so is 'Work it out' and I think these beats really suite Beyonce and my close second fav's are 'Speechless' and 'Me, myself and I'. The first single 'Crazy Inlove' has a different and confusing beat and I don't like it. I also don't like 'That's how you like it' also with Jay-Z (Okay I'm not a fan!), and 'Yes' is also whack. 'Hip-hop star' and 'Baby boi' are nice and they'll probably be the follow up singles. I like 'Naughty girl', 'Signs', 'The closer I get to you' (with Luther) and obviously the title track (even from the days of the Survivor album). Overall I think it's a good enough effort but not awesome.
B0000028MA|4.0|i bought this album to remind me of my pearl jam days and grunge days... i do love most of the tracks on this album... especially pearl jam... but only 4 stars because i am not a big fan of soundgarden... and chris cornell's wailing gets to me... other than that... love the album....
B000099T2L|1.0|This album is totally garbage. I bought it the second it came out. I like tracks 1, 10, the song with Missy, and Speechlesss. The rest of the songs are so wack they REALLY cancel out the prettty good songs.
B000002AZ8|5.0|i just love pearl jam... eddie vedder sings like no one else... although vitalogy doesn't have the grip of ten or the crunch of VS.... tracks like &quot;nothingman&quot; and &quot;tremor christ&quot; will leave you feeling something....
B000099T2L|5.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF SUMMER 2003 BEST ALBUM. I BOUGHT IT TODAY @ 8 AM AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I FINALY HAVE IT IN MY HANDS. I THINK THAT THIS TIME BEYONCE IS GOING TO ROCK WITH HER SOLO ALBUM. I LOVE DESTINY'S CHILD AND NOW THAT THEIR SOLO ALBUM HAS COME OUT I HAD TO BUY THEM ALL. I HAVE ALL THE DC ALBUMS PLUS COPILATIONS AND SINGLES AS WELL. AND NOW I HAVE THEIR SOLO ALBUM. I CANT WAIT TO HEAR THEM SING IN DESTINY'S CHILD AGAIN. MISS U SO MUCH DC SO PLEASE LET THE WORLD NOW THAT U R STILL DC NO MATTER WHAT. GOOD LUCK ALWAYS TO MICHELLE, KELLY AND BEYONCE AS WELL AS THE OTHER 3 GIRLS THAT LEFT DC. GOOD LUCK ALWAYS. LOVE UR #1 FAN<BR>IGNACIO ALCALA.
B000001FA4|5.0|Their is a lot to be said about this masterpiece, that being said one should look no further with u2 that this record, it is simply an album on its own. This record has opened caverns in my mind that i never knew existed. Its melancholy is unsurpassable, its beauty intense and the fact that some songs(if not most)were recorded right off the floor just go to show that something magical was happening with these guys in 1985.If not for Pop and Achtung  Baby this would have been the last great record in this bands career.
B00005JLWN|4.0|the movie itself have a very powerful and deep meaning to it.  It was meant for the audience to think about their feelings that they take for granted.  To persude the audience to think in an odd way.  to proclaim to that world is not based on what you see or do, but on what you feel.<br />I have not seen Far...heit 451, so i have no right to make any comparsion, but I have seen the Matrix, and the Matrix Reload.  Compared between the two movie, each has it ups and downs.  The Matix is very deep and complix,  its fights are based on the speed of the character.  Because the Neo (the main character) is supernaturally faster than the nake eye can see.  the movie gives u a slow motion point of view.  On the other hand, John Preston (the main character of Equilibrium) is not superfast,but he is fast.  Not too fast, that you need a slow motion point of view, but fast.  His accuarties is very...
B00009V7T2|5.0|When you first pop in this album it seem's like such odd ball music. You might even get the feeling that it just sounds like noise. By second listen you find some amazing riffs. By third listen you find some amazing structor in the songs. By fourth and fivth etc you realize how amazing this album is.<br />people often wonder what the mars volta sound like. To be honest it's hard to discribe. Some would say fugazi meats prog rock. But don't let the prog rock scare you. It is about time a band makes music that progresses. <br />One of the highlights of the album is roulette dares. Catchy yet not, loud yet soft. Though it may sound like a discription of many other bands that do that, trust me, there is something different about this band, and especially the album. As the song builds up you feel the intencity and the strain in the songs. It is very rare that an album can do this.<br />The last song Take the veil cerpin taxt shows off the unqiue vocals of cedric, and their version of &quot;the wall of sound&quot;, which instead of just combining sound now its sound and energy. Energy is a pig part of this album, Maybe that's what has been missing from music lately. You can almost imagine omar and cedric really get into the music as you hear the songs, which is probably the biggest pay off of this album.<br />Another interesting point about this album is the fact that it is on a major. And it is a good thing, An album like this you want many many people to hear because this is a revoultionary album for music on a mainstream level. There is only a few albums in the past 10 years or so that can capture what music is all about...this is one of them.
B00003CXXM|1.0|Story is ok, but nothing original, and acting is bottom horrible.  Damon has no personality whatsoever on screen.
0393057658|5.0|If you have ever read Bill James or Rob Neyer, this book is definately for you, for everyone else, this book will make you take a second look at the game.  <BR>As Michale Lewis takes a look at the Oakland A's organization, we are privy to many different inside the game conversations.  The reader quickly learns how it is that the A's have been able to succeed while others say they can't, by looking at the game differently.  This different look has grown in recent years and will continue to grow as the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Boston Red Sox now have GM's with a strong SABR based analysis of prospects.<BR>I highly reccomend this book for all baseball lovers.
B00004YA66|5.0|The premise of this movie is absolutely fascinating!  In 1999, John Sullivan, a lonely and bitter 36 year old, starts playing with his dad's old ham radio during a Northern lights display and somehow happens to get in touch with his dad (who died 30 years earlier) in 1969, a time of innocence and the age of the Amazin' Mets.  As John and his dad start to change the past, they also alter future events in both good and bad ways.  Can they put things right before they lose their special connection for good?<br />The idea is unique and stays so throughout.  The underrated and execellent drama/thriller is well written and acted.  The movies deals with several interesting issues, is exciting without falling to the typical thriller antics and is touching without being maudlin.  Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen.  All those who had even a small part in this movie should be proud of the wonderful movie they helped make.  I recommend this movie in the highest terms.
B000099T2L|2.0|For once, i actually listened to the cd at the record store before i decided to buy. I was so thankful i did. One word describes this cd....WHACK! Its sad to see this cd is going to sell millions and millions only because its a big star like Beyonce. Nothing new here. Its a sleeper.
B000089RVX|5.0|She has a good voice, and it's nice to listen to something different for a while! Here's a quick review:<br /> Going Under: 10/10 Great start, fast paced and love the chorus, probably next single<br /> Bring Me to Life: 10/10 Everyone's heard this, great, with Paul Mccoy!<br /> Everbody's Fool: 10/10 One of my favourites!<br /> My Immortal: 9/10 She's not the greatest slow song singer, but it's alot better then the other one, she put her heart into it, so good for her! <br /> Haunted: 10/10 I love this song, especially the chorus, nifty!<br /> Tourniquet: 11/10 My absolute favourite off the album, a punk song, different from what they were playing before.<br /> Imaginary: 9.5/10 Good, but not the greatest! <br /> Taking Over Me: 10/10 Another one of my favourites, love it!!<br /> Hello: 6.5/10 A great melody, just not suited for her!<br /> Holding My Last Breath: 10.5/10 It's a sad song, makes me want to cry sometimes, I love it, it's a beautiful song!! It's pretty fast, not slow.<br /> Whisper: 10/10 Great for the last song, but that saying at the end of the song gets annoying, don't listen to it fully, otherwise, you'll be completely sick of that saying at the end! Otherwise, it has a great chorus and a strong beat, I love it!!<br /> Evanescence is one of a kind! It's good seeing a girl sing more of rock/metal music, getting sick of the guys singing all the time. Girls tend have better voices anyway! It's a great cd, get it today!
B00004U2G1|2.0|I love this album by Boston.  I bought it in SACD format, but it's nothing like the other SACD's I bought.  It only plays out of 2 speakers and my sub.  It sounds &quot;okay&quot;, but I was pretty disappointed.  Nothing comes out of the center channel and the rear speakers.  What's with that?
B000099T2L|5.0|This is what we have all been waitin for...the debt CD of the lead singer in the group Destiny's Child.  We've seen her say \\"No No No\\" and ask her man can he pay her bills, from telephone bills to the automo-BILLs.She wanted her man to say her name, and he was a bug a boo.  But when she got fed up she left her man @ home and went to tha club and got \\"Jumpin Jumpin\\" She came out on top because she is a \\"Survivor.\\" Then she got very \\"Bootylicious.\\"With  all of the good things happening, she still let \\" Emotion\\" take her over. Then she starred in Austin Powers: Goldmember.  We saw her \\"WorkIt Out.\\"  Now she is Dangerously In Love! This is not what some people may think.  They may think...\\"O well, Its just Beyonce, the girl from DC-3.  Her music will be the same as the group's music....THINK AGAIN! This is really different from anything I've heard her do. You have some songs that get you crunk and some songs that just make you think, and some love making songs. Basically its a little sumthin 4 everyone.  Lemme show you how i would rate these joints.<br />1. Crazy In Love (9/10)- Its the first single off of the album. At 1st i wasnt feelin it, but when homegirl did that booty dance i was like WHOA!  And it took a while to feel this one cuz its not like any or everything you hear everyday.<br />2. Naughty Girl (10/10)- This was supposed to be the 1st single.  But she re-thought it out and said Crazy in love would be better.  This has like an Arabian Jamaican feel to it.  Real club banger fa tha ladies.<br />3.Baby Boy Featuring Sean Paul (10/10)- Need i say more? If Sean Paul' on a track, we all know what the deal is. Tha man did tha damn thang. Its hot. Its OFF GLASS FA SHO. The beat is OOOO LAWDY!!!HOT! So far, i am having no dislikes about this album.<br />4. Hip Hop Star feat Big Boi of OutKast (9/10)- Well, 1st off, unless you are a fan of OutKast, you wont feel this one.  It has a tight ass beat, and she comes in with them vocals and it makes you bounce, then big boi laces it with his rhymes, makes it tighter.  HOLLA!<br />5. Be With You (9/10)- This song is such  laid back type of song you just chill on and look out your window wit a wine cooler in your hand.  Lyrics are kool (basically every lyric on this album is excellent\\"<br />6. Me Myself and I (9/10)- Lyrics are very catchy, again a laid back type of song with ya wine in ya hand.  Sounds sorta like Be with you. Im feelin it.  MAY I REMIND YOU THAT I AM HAVING NO COMPLAINTS RIGHT NOW.<br />7. Yes (20/10)- THIS IS THA $H1T RIGHT HERE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE.  I mean, all of them are my favorites, but this one is like WHOA! That beat and then she lacin it with them vocals.  The lyrics say that basically she said yes to her man's momma, yes to him when he asked could they date, but he asked for the cooter and she said no, and he acted so unratefully say that she moved too slow.

1878424319|2.0|This is a good book.  I decided to pop a 2 star down just to balance out all of the exaggerration votes thrown up for this teeny tiny book.  Take a look at the dimensions of this book.  All it says is to always tell the truth, always try as hard as you can, to never take anything personal, and don't make assumptions.  This book is the type that you read and it inspires you to behave a little differently for a day or two, but is entirely forgettable beyond that point.  I think that for the same amount of money you can get a book that is 4 times bigger and actually has something to digest.  This book didn't change me at all. A good book is one that you can't help but remember; I kind of wish I could forget buying this little money maker.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce Giselle Knowles, showcased her writing skills, her vocals, parts that she has not shown the world.  This CD is worth 10 stars.  It is on the same level as Aaliyah's Aaliyah CD.  Her collaborations are perfect.  Missy Elliot did a good song, Signs.  And the Luther duet, Closer I Get To You, was sung much better by these two than Donnie And Roberta.  Her ballads, and her uptempo songs balance out with giving u enough of both.  Speechless, to me that is the best song on the album, its sexy and it is just the ....    All in All, this is a CD for 03 & 04.  U did ur thang Beyonce.  Im so happy 4 u.  U representin Texas.  Bee~

0142004235|5.0|I first read this book 38 years ago and the characters in this book remain as vivid as the California landscape that Steinbeck masterfully details.  Who can forget Cathy's innocent-faced evil, Adam Trask's flawed goodness, Lee's dual identity as undeucated coolie in public and intellectual in private, Cal's pain at being rejected by his father, Kate's murderous duplicity or Samuel's strength in friendship?  The dry foothills of California's Salinas Valley, the rough side of Salinas (the town where Steinbeck grew up), Monterey, even San Francisco's Chinatown are lovingly detailed in this portrait of the California of Steinbeck's early years.  Members of the Steinbeck family including John make cameo appearances in the book, although a reader would need to have that fact pointed out. Curiously Steinbeck allows no motivation for Cathy's (Kate's) evil- she appears to be simply bad seed, whereas Caleb's greatest sins are seen as understandable reaction to Adam's failings as a father.  But is Caleb doomed to evil?  As Adam says on his dathbed, \\"Timshel\\", \\"Thou mayest\\" triumph over evil.
037542217X|5.0|&quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot; is the fourth novel in Alexander McCall Smith's spectacularly successful series about a lady detective in Botswana. Precious Ramotswe is facing new challenges. A rival detective agency opens up nearby, and Mma. Ramotswe is worried about the competition. The two orphans whom she and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni adopted are having problems. In addition, Mma. Ramotswe is worried about her assistant, Mma. Makutsi, who cannot seem to find a husband.<br />However, Mma. Ramotswe is an optimistic person by nature and she tries to set aside her worries.  One way to forget her troubles is to take on new clients.  Mma. Ramotswe accepts the case of a woman who suspects that her husband is being unfaithful.  Another client is a wealthy man who wants Mma. Ramotswe to find two women whom he had wronged in the past. He wishes to apologize to them and make amends for his bad behavior.<br />As in his earlier books, Smith's writing is sweet, funny, understated and touching. Mma. Ramotswe again displays her keen insight into human nature and her empathy for those who are in pain. &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot; is written simply but it is never simplistic. This novel will delight Alexander McCall Smith's fans, and it will make readers of this series impatient for the next installment.
B00000253N|1.0|Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen should have stuck to writting the lyrics/songs and letting others do the singing.  Although Bruce is a total phoney (he likes to write songs about rough times at the same time being a multi-millionaire), Bob Dylan at least made an important contribution to the folk/rock movement.<br />So many-an album by Dylan is ruined by his whining/whaling/screeching/yelping and nostril-itis.   If you want to get rid of the rats and cockroaches in your house, forget about buying spray or getting an exterminator.  Simply put on a Bob Dylan album at full blast and watch the rodents and roaches run out of the house in all directions as fast as they can.<br />If you want to check out Dylan, check out the legends that have covered some of his tunes (ie, Joan Baez, Jimmy Hendrix, etc..).  How anyone can like listening to this gibberish is beyond me.
038572179X|5.0|Not only is this a tightly-wound, suspenseful novel, it is also a brilliant realization of the power of fiction to create reality.  Also amazing is the ability of this middle-age man to plumb the depths of a creative and psychologically complex pre-adolscent girl, Briony.  Briony sins--there's no other word for it--and must atone for the wreckage she's caused.  How this reckoning unfolds is at the heart of this powerful post-modern morality tale.
B000002JNG|3.0|Manic Nirvana is the no surprises, no frills album of Robert Plant's solo career.  His first four releases all were considerably diverse musically, but on Manic Nirvana, Plant decides to go back to the basics with an updated Zep approach.  Certainly the least adventurous of the lot, Manic still manages a good deal of buoyancy and texture in places.  The best selections are where he decides to stretch out a bit from the norm, such as the dramatic snare drum led ballad &quot;Anniversary&quot; and the quiet accoustic &quot;Liar's Dance.&quot; Generally, the last half of the album (where both the aforesaid mentioned songs appear) impresses more than side one.  The best from that half is the emotional &quot;I Cried,&quot;  with the majority of the rest being unremarkable radio styled hard rock.  Plant seems to be trying to please everyone here, from the Zep fans of old to those who were entertained by the experimentation of Shaken N' Stirred.  Problem is, technology got in the way of what could have been some his finest hard rockers since Zep.  All said, not bad... just a bit tough to pinpoint.

0375414053|3.0|Because of my unconsummated love for Allison Pearson's husband, the brilliant New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane, I had to read this book, hoping for insights into her marriage and husband.  As I'd expect, she is whip-smart and funny, just as he is.<BR>But my boy Anthony is concise, while wife is a bit verbose.  The edge of her humor dulled a bit as she stretched what should be a thin novel to over 300 pages.  Case in point: did she have to include two scenes in which Kate \\"distresses\\" store-bought baked goods in attempt to pass them off as her own?<br />And, like most readers, I found it hard not to respond by saying it's not hard to do it when you've got a full-time nanny, a cleaning lady, and wads o' cash!
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie was without question the most brilliant, moving, deep, inspiring, and honest movie I have ever seen.  It's meaning and lesson goes so deep that sadly, many people (esp. those who gave it a bad review) were lost as to what it's meaning is.  While I'll state again that this movie is amazing and my all time favorite, I have to warn that if you are interested in watching a movie simply for thoughtless enjoyment- this is not your type of movie.  While it does have a lot of humor, it is more intellectual and far from the slap-stick comedy commonly presented today.  This is a truly enlightening film and brilliantly done, but it is not for everyone, though I recommend you see it before you rule it out as &quot;over rated&quot; or &quot;not your type of movie&quot;.  I think that this movie also can not be fully comprehended with just one viewing, so I suggest that if you didn't get it the first time and are not completely turned off, watch it again.  It is well worth the time spent!

B00003CWTI|3.0|Overall I have to agree with another reviewer above (Richard).<BR>I saw the 1st half hour of this film at a friend's house, and bought the DVD on that premise:<br />I think the introduction and the first 5-10 minutes of Magnolia are fantastic. But then the characters are introduced...<br />Earl (Jason Robards) is tragic and likeable enough- but doesn't have enough screentime to be even vaguely important to the plot.<br />Earl's wife (Julianne Moore) is gorgeous as ever, but her character again doesn't seem to affect the plot much.<br />Earl's male nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) gives one of the better performances of the film, and he is probably the most likeable and engaging character of them all.<br />Tom Cruise's chraracter, Frank T J Mackey is so shallow and unlikeable up until right at the end (I won't give the plot away - don't worry!) that I began to skip the parts with him in.<br />The Cop (John C Reilly) is convincing enough as the clumsy cop he plays and another likeable character, but again, as pointed out by Richard - his fascination with the character played by Melora Walters is a little unrealistic.<br />Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) puts in a fine performance as the young prodigy forced into the limelight, and is another likeable character.<br />Quiz-kid Donnie Smith (William H Macy) is strangely likeable even through his irritating self-loathing and well-played by reliable Macy, but seems a little remote from the rest of the (supposedly) inter-linked plot except for some slight coincidences.<br />Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is quite a balanced character - providing one the films twists near the end, and is well played.<br />Jimmy's estranged cokehead daughter is played convincingly by Melora Walters, but her relationship with John C Reilly's cop (mentioned earlier) is very unlikely.<br />Overall - all the actors actual performances AS their characters are very good, as are the direction, score and screenplay. However, the actual plot and characters are the deciding factor in my giving this film 3/5 stars.<br />The film does of course, have many good points, including, as mentioned, it's introduction and it's score.
B000001FMX|5.0|...Most especially if you're a fan of punk or glam rock. The New York Dolls to me are category-less, but their songs are timeless anthems that every punk rock fan should know. Dee Dee Ramone (of the Ramones) and Johnny Thunders were close associates. The Dolls were sparking up new bands around New York for years. They grew to be one of the most inspirational groups of all time. But besides the impact they would have on other bands, the New York Dolls' sound is magnificent. The songs \\"Trash\\" and \\"Personality Crisis\\" and \\"Pills\\" can't be missed.

B00000294R|5.0|After reading everyone else's reviews, I disagree with most people's choice of favorites on this album.  The Kid Capri beat and the beat of No Endz No Skinz are weak (but L can do no wrong on the mic).  The rest of the album has some of the tightest beats, thick ass bass, jazzed out but rough at the same time...Big L is a legend.  I wish his posthumous release had been executed properly by those in charge of it.  It too is a must have just because L is a god, but this release entirely changed me, and was all I could listen to for months.
B000002UAX|2.0|The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper in 1967, and Abbey Road and Let It Be were both recorded in 1969.  In between, in 1968, this 30 SONG COMPILATION was released, and much of it appears to be cleaning out the vault.<br />There are 13-14 songs that comprise a great album (led by Back in the USSR), but to get it you have to wade through the 16-17 songs that are mediocre.  The so-called diversity of the musical styles here doesn't help.  Anyone who disagrees is wearing Beatles-style rose colored glasses.

B00009V7T2|5.0|WOW, i bought this album just a few hours ago(first day this was available to buy) and wow. i understand why every other review on magazines give it a 5/5.

0312983867|3.0|I've read all of the Stephanie Plum books and this one was my least favorite. I found it rambling and silly. There was not any real mystery or intrigue-just more of the same-the perils of Plum. It's time for some changes.
0553103547|5.0|Having toiled through countless unimaginative imitators of Tolkein, I had despaired of ever reading heroic fantasy again, that might capture some breath of the heroic, or of the fantastic. George R.R. Martin does so, and he does so wonderfully. Each character is masterfully wrought, so that even unsympathetic villains are sympathetically portrayed: their follies and virtues are just like life. The supernatural elements in the early part of the tale are few, as they should be, but eerie, as they should be: the grandeur of the icy Wall that stretches across the dark wilderness of the North, beyond which inhuman Others, ice-bears, brigands, savage wolves, and unclean spirits dwell is not easily forgotten. But even in lesser scenes, where, for example, Jon Snow, the bastard son of Lord Stark, finds the orphaned pups of dire wolves, are richly redolent of myth. The reward of mercy is that the great wolves act, more than once, as protectors of the children who raised them.<br />Having toiled also through tales pretending to tell of court intrigue and do not, I rejoice that George R.R. Martin does for true what other books only play at. The intrigue here is knotted as a labyrinth, done as it should be, with real stakes in the wager, and real blood shed.<br />I have toiled also through tales pretending to be set in the ancient world, or in fairyland, and finding the inhabitance of those fair and far and mythic places no different (and no more interesting) than Southern Californians, complete with modern concerns, cant, and slogans: feminists in fairyland, democrats in the dark ages. Say what you will, but bastards and cripples were not treated kindly in the ruder ages of the world, and it refreshing to see a portrayal of the cruel days when men lived by swordplay not prettified by modern pieties.<br />I am a lawyer by trade, so when a medieval Lord, when declaring a knight traitor, \\"attaints\\" his blood, I know then that the author has done his homework, and knows something of the period in which he sets his tale.<br />Vividly drawn, intricate, and compelling are all words too weak to praise this book properly. All I can say, after so many dreadful \\"epics\\", is that at last here is one worthy of the name: at last! At last! At last!the period in which he sets his tale. <BR>Vividly drawn, intricate, and compelling are all words too weak to praise this book properly.

0393057658|5.0|As an avid baseball fan, avid Seattle Mariner's fan, and avid Oakland Athletic's hater, I am in complete awe of this book. While I don't agree with every one of Billy Beane's philosophy's, so much of it makes sense.  When you break it down, it's hard to dispute that it works for him. If every team used his thoughts would it work? Probably not, but that's the beauty of Billy and his team of computer nerds, they made a new way of thinking in baseball work.<br />Even if you're not a baseball fan, this book is a fabulous read. While he does go into great detail about many aspects of the game a casual observer wouldn't understand, he does it with such grace and elegance that it doesn't get the least bit heavy handed. Micheal Lewis is a master at turning in something that may seem dry to some, and making it a personal, touching story, with fabulous characters and incredible plot development. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It will be talked about for the next few decades for sure, if not beyond.
B00009V7T2|4.0|The songs are longer (average 5-6 minutes) and full of atmospheric guitars and vocals. The singing is good. Full of new sounds like uh jazz stuff mixed with rock. <BR>Between the ex-members of At The Drive In I think both Sparta and Mars Volta are doing well for themselves. Sparta is more radio friendly while Mars Volta is experimenting, both are good but not as good as ATDI.
B00000099Y|4.0|This album ranks in the upper echelon of all progressive-rock releases. Ever.  Words do not describe my reaction to this masterpiece upon every listen.  It is (not to sound too contrived) an emotional rollercoaster.  I write this review not so much to preach to the choir, nor to convert the naysayers--I simply ask that every one give it a listen.  I don't normally waste the time to review albums, and I am not pretentious.  I do not believe that this music is for every one.  Some will not like Tool.  This is inevitable.  I equate this point to the large demographic in America that is too afraid to exercise.  The same line of reasoning, I believe, is effected.<br />All the same, I think it should be prescribed to those who dismiss Aenima as shallow and uncalculated to take a second listen.  And a third.  I do not believe that this album was constructed with profit or recognition in mind.  It is simply as art is to the artist--uncompromised and not easy to translate.  Some songs require repeated listening so that they can be partially deconstructed by the listener--these songs are not user-friendly, and I find that to be what is most intriguing about them.  [this is even more blatantly apparent on Tool's next release, Lateralus]<br />Layers and textures abound on Aenima.  I do not pretend to be a great purveyor of musical wisdom or prowess, but I do know that each individual member of Tool contributes in a way that is unique to his instrument.  Danny Carey's drumming continually sets what I believe should be the ever-rising standard in metal.  The pounding pulse of the rhythm section is what originally drew me to this band--the sound is comprehensive, all-encompassing, and unforgiving.<br />Danny Carey is the wind in the sails of Tool.  But Adam Jones has created an extensive catalog of fuzzy licks and pulsating rhythms that can only be described as the band's sails themselves.  Without Jones' lone guitar juggernaut the music would not flourish.  And, in keeping with this shallow analogy, Justin Chancellor's bass comprises the ship's rudder.  His relentless lines complement the overall sound wonderfully, giving the band its tireless grooves and, ultimately, changing its direction within the songs.<BR>Without Keenan's mix of masterful belting and pitiful whispering, however, the ship would go nowhere.  He is undeniably the ship's captain.  Although the entire band contributes pretty evenly across the board, Keenan's vocals are what give each song its individually unique stamp.  His lyrics, though, are what open the band to varied translations and criticism.<br />\\"Eulogy\\" is probably the best song on the album.  But I say this with the firm knowledge that it is dismissed as tiresome, repetitive, and contrived.  The lyrics might offend some, as well they should, but the possibility of mistranslation is fundamental in understanding how the populace might receive a song with such lyrics as \\"to ascend you must die...you must be crucified for your sins and your lies...\\"  Though in my mind the lyrics are a wonderful sample of the vaguely apparent sarcasm in many of Tool's best pieces, they have seemingly been cemented by some on the right as those of a converted hot-head.  But, although it does not specifically mention Jesus Christ, the song surely and inevitably does turn fundamentalists against the band, dismissing its sentiment as more of a cheesy take on popular religion.  I simply do not subscribe to the lyrics.  They do not tell a story--rather, they set a mood.<br />Tool is not taylor-made listening, nor are they manufactured as accessible, and that is part of the larger picture of what sets them apart from the rest of mainstream rock.  The band has contructed an image that is three-part neo-political nightmare, bizaare freak show, and dark gothic underworldlings. They do enjoy a large fan base, and this is due in part to the mystique.  Album packaging and on-stage antics have helped to craft this image.  But the focus is always on the music, as it should be.
B000002542|5.0|The musicianship on this production is enough to warrant any price. Many times in history , fads or whims lead people to ignore what is black and white.  The milestone is the trade between Greg and Neil throughout this entire cd. You will hear what evolved as the musicians parted ways with Carlos Santana. And the influence of that endevor. You will hear the tightest progressions. and most ctreative hooks and melodic lines in this release. Really smart guitar and keyboard leads are exchanged in the very most impressive manor.  The key board players like Greg Rollie make the structure of the music complex,, yet , catchy and melodic.

I like the five tornado scenes. <BR>Even when things like cows, houses, cars, and trees are flying around makes the movie more exciting. The characters in the movie are okay for their roles only I don't get why the tornado catchers problems and marriages have to do with the movie. I found the beggining sad when the little girl lost her dad because of the twister. The reason for chasing the twister is so the tornado chasers can improve the tornado warning system.<BR>The movie went by smoothly and I still enjoy it. I would recommend renting it before buying.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is definitely worth buying. I didn't like her first cd at all (Too Teenybopish) but after hearing her sing a couple of songs live on MTV, I thought &quot;oh what the heck&quot;!  So I bought it...the best decision I ever made!  I love this CD...to this day I still listen to it and I am moved by her amazing voice!  My favorites are &quot;Walk Away&quot;, &quot;Infatuation&quot;, &quot;Fighter&quot;, &quot;The Voice Within&quot; (amazaing), &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot;, heck...I like the whole CD and to me that says alot.  Never have I had a CD with all the songs on them great songs!  GET THIS CD!!
6304030983|4.0|I first saw this movie at the movie theatres when I was 7. Now I am 14 and I still like this movie. It is about a board game, when you play it real things from the jungle come to life from the game. Four characters must finish the game to make everything from the game go away. I am very impressed with the way the animals and the effects looked. The actors did an excellent job especially Bonnie Hunt and Robin Williams. The movie went by smoothly. I enjoyed the movie a lot. The movie may be a little dark because my little sister was scared the first time she saw it. Everytime she watches it more she gets less scared. I don't know why. I recommend this movie to anybody!
B00005QDW1|2.0|One quick complaint . . . when did No Doubt become Gwen Stefani and her backup band? Am I the only person really annoyed that everyone seems to have forgotten Stefani is only 1/4 of the group?<br />As for this album, I can't say I'm all that impressed. These lyrics would be pathetic for a band's debut, but that this album was released after the greatness that was Return of Saturn is beyond sad. Case in point: \\"Hey girl save the liar, can't you see his pants on fire?\\" from \\"Detective\\".<br />I've noticed that most of the songs on Rock Steady have a minimum number of lyrics that are repeated over and over throughout the song (hello \\"Hey Baby\\"). Even as a brainless party album, this CD barely gets by. There are a few decent songs: \\"Hella Good,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and \\"Making Out\\" come to mind. \\"Running\\" just gets irritating after about five listens. And what the hell is with the middle of \\"Underneath it All\\"? No Doubt is the only band I know of that can have an absolutely great song on their hands and then screw up the middle of it (see also \\"Home Now\\" off Return of Saturn).<br />I would not get this album if you're new to No Doubt. I'd start with the classic Tragic Kingdom or the phenomenal Return of Saturn. Buy this one only if you're looking to complete your collection.

But in this one he just running around desroying everything in Manhattan,New York. The movie would have been better if Godzilla was fighting a monster. I added this movie one star because I like the effects on Godzilla and there are only three scenes on this movie I like. The one when Godzilla was just entering the city. Near the end when Godzilla's eggs were hatching and the babies were roaming the building chasing the four main characters.Godzilla got trapped on the Brooklyn bridge and he got shot four times(I think). This movie had only a couple of good scenes but overall it wasn't that good throughout the movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|After I bought Coldplay's debut, Parachutes, I was lukewarm about them. There were some great songs on it, but I didn't understand what people thought was so amazing about it. The songs tended to have the same beat and generally the same sound to them. I didn't think Coldplay was right in receiving all the attention and being touted as the new great British band when other awesome bands, like Travis or the Doves, were standing in the background.  After buying A Rush of Blood to the Head, however, I was blown away. The songs on this album are very distinctive from each other, both in melodies and lyrics. Already we can hear Coldplay evolving and maturing as a band. Standout tracks include: &quot;Politik,&quot; &quot;Green Eyes&quot; (which sounds like it could have been on Parachutes), &quot;The Scientist,&quot; &quot;Clocks,&quot; and the title track.<br />On a final note, I just caught Coldplay's live show. If you ever have the chance to see them live, you should definitely take it. It was one of the best concerts I've ever been to (and Chris Martin's voice is as beautiful in person as it is on their CDs).
B00000J7JO|3.0|When I first listened to this album I thought it was brilliant. I immediately bought a copy and put it on. After a few listens, however, I began to feel a little tired, a bit bored...and even a little let down. Musically, all the songs on the album are great. But there's something lacking. The whole album just seems too formulaic. Most of the songs sound way too similar (something that we could never accuse thier earlier albums of doing) and its almost as if the production was too clean and polished. Blood Sugar was the kind of album that forced you to pay attention and say &quot;WOW&quot;. I don'tthink Californication does this at all. I dont expect that we will see a true revival of  the ground breaking, genre bending band that was RHCP. Rather, as in Californication, we will hear good yet somewhat listless and unadventerous music.

0783225792|5.0|This movie seems to have everything a great story requires: a colorful setting, fascinating characters, an action-filled plot sustained by a multiple of tensions and conflicts, and all manner of revelations about the uses and abuses of power in the casino world of Las Vegas. What makes this movie especially interesting to me is the sub texture of individual characters (especially those played by DeNiro and Stone) who seem to be torn between various addictions and the demands of those addictions on the heart and mind. I almost (not quite) feel sympathy for DeNiro's character (\\"Ace\\" Rothstein) who manifests all of the requisite skills of an effective CEO amidst all the corruption he accepts and thereby condones. He wants to be a loving, devoted husband and father. Except for his feelings for the character played by Stone (Ginger McKenna), he is the absolute realist. The life he offers to her is one which, from the moment he proposes marriage, she is reluctantly willing but ultimately unable to accept. The characters played by Pesci (Nicky Santoro) and Woods (Lester Diamond) are most representative of an underworld culture of crime and corruption, addiction, violence, greed, glamor, and self-interest. The first half of the movie is essentially a documentary on the casino world, crisply and (when necessary) brutally managed by those controlled by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. The fictional narrative becomes dominant in the second half as the mob eventually loses its control and most of the characters lose their lives. Corruption exists at all levels of this world, varying only in terms of degree of access to the hundreds of millions of dollars processed each day. Meanwhile, conventioneers and tourists pour through the casinos, unaware of the human darkness concealed by the sparkling lights.
B00005JKN9|3.0|THE GANGS OF NEW YORK features camera-shy performer Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting in what is probably his best role to date. Day-Lewis, who doesn't make many movies, is smart enough to be selective in this era of empty-headed movies. My hat is off to him. A brutal performance. A performance nightmares are made of. A great performance. Unfortunately, Day-Lewis is almost the only saving grace in Martin Scorsese's 3-hour blood-bath. Spending north of $100 million, Scorsese took several years to complete this drama about the New York draft riots in 1863. The costumes, the look of the town, even the violence is very effective. But as the film proceeds the violence piles up. The streets are running red with blood. While 'the butcher' is always a fascinating character to watch, nobody else is as watchable. Leonardo DiCaprio, who seeks the death of 'the butcher' for murdering his father (nicely played by Liam Neeson in a cameo), is sadly miscast here. Or maybe anybody would be when compared to the monumental acting talents of Day-Lewis. No fault of DiCaprio. Cameron Diaz is terribly wasted. Scorsese has made a 'man's film', and it would seem there is little use for women, including Diaz. It is always good to see Henry Thomas' career be given a boost with a large role. He plays Jonny, DiCaprio's friend, and a loyal follower of Cutting's. A strong performance, and this young man is still learning his craft. He'll only get better. But all of these actor's abilities pale in comparison to Day-Lewis. Again, no fault of Scorsese here. His primary fault is losing himself in the violence, in the blood, in the tragic events that unfold throughout the film. Three hours of grisly death is hard to stomach. And with so little humor in the film, it's not a wonder why there are people who either love the film or hate it. As for me, I appreciated the scope of the film. I understood what Scorsese was trying to do. But somewhere in the making of the epic, the director lost his way, his focus. Day-Lewis displays an actor's clinic with his performance. This is the main reason why you should see the movie. There are some other fine moments as well. Afterall, Scorsese is Scorsese. The film in a lesser director's hands would have churned out a piece of cheese. Still, even great directors sometimes lose their way. For Scorsese, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK was one time he did.
0790729725|5.0|This film is based on a book written by Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy) as was Casino based on another of his books (Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas). Both were directed by Scorcese and two of the major characters in both films are portrayed by DeNiro (\\"Ace\\" Rothstein and Jimmy Conway) and Joe Pesci (Nicky Santoro and Tommy DeVito). For me, these are the only significant similarities between the two film classics. True, Scorcese effectively employs a number of documentary techniques in both (especially during the first half of Casino) but the setting of GoodFellas is essentially a neighborhood whereas Casino examines the gambling culture of Las Vegas, represented by the Tangiers which is owned by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. Moreover, the character Henry Hill (portrayed as an adult by Ray Liotta) is used as a device by which to explain rites of passage into the local crime world whereas the focal point of Casino is Rothstein as he becomes (in effect) the COO of a major casino and quickly establishes total local control of its operations, then (for various reasons) makes personal decisions which eventually place him and his absentee bosses in harm's way. One of the several reasons I admire Scorcese so much is his talent (indeed genius) for creating so-called \\"minor\\" but nonetheless memorable, indeed unforgettable characters. For example, Paul Cicero (portrayed by Paul Sorvino) in this film, a character which may have had some influence on the creation of another character, Tony Soprano. Cicero embodies menace precisely because his personality is so understated. His selective use of a paternalistic posture (reminiscent of Johnny Friendly's, a less-subtle character played by Lee J. Cobb in On the Waterfront) belies his absolute determination to sustain absolute control over his crime operations. Comparisons and contrasts of this film with Casino are probably inevitable. I think both are classics but for different reasons. The former is anchored in local experience, somewhat \\"small-time\\" crime if you will, whereas the latter examines the culture of an entire industry in which the scale and impact of crime are far greater. (The same point could be made about Godfather I and Godfather II, although I much prefer to view them in a chronological sequence.) Even in Casino, however, Scorcese constantly locks in on two or three characters in a specific situation. He is at his best when dramatizing the dynamics of verbal and physical violence in small scale (e.g. Raging Bull and The Gangs of New York). In my opinion, like Tolstoy, Scorcese's vision may be \\"epic\\" in certain films but the impact of his art is best measured in quite human terms...scene by scene, juxtaposing statement and response, action and reaction.erience, somewhat \\"small-time\\" crime if you will, whereas the latter examines the culture of an entire industry in which the scale and impact of crime are far greater.

B000008GEF|5.0|Living In The Material Word is, to me, the musical essence of what George Harrison was all about. Unfortunately, it also provided a handful of ammunition to Harrison's detractors and inaugurated George's status as a musical pi&ntilde;ata for the critics. Rolling Stone did give it a good review, though.<br />George was definitely on a role during this time, and Living In The Material World was a commercial blockbuster. But LITMW was quickly forgotten, which was (and is) undeserved. Some of Harrison's most beguiling melodies and his most soulful slide playing are present on this masterpiece, and his often-criticized vocals are in great shape. But it would be a mistake to assume that \\"Living In...\\" makes for an immediately infectious listening experience; many of the best songs require repeated listening to be fully appreciated. Frankly, it took me a few years to fully appreciate the beauty & mastery of these songs.<br />\\"Give Me Love\\" is the song here that everybody knows. Criticized in some quarters for being \\"preachy\\" and redundant, it actually boasts an attractive melody and some inspired guitar work.<br />\\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" is the sole diatribe on LITMW. Apparently aimed at Paul McCartney, it's not as nasty as Lennon's \\"How Do You Sleep\\" or as goofy as Ringo's \\"Early 1970\\". The dobro work on the tune is excellent, and George really doesn't come across as vindictive, merely resigned.<br />\\"The Light That Has Lighted The World\\" is one of those tunes that took me forever to appreciate. To those who don't like introspective tunes, it comes across as dull as dishwater. But if one relaxes & allows the Zen-like melody some room to breathe, it can be very therapeutic.<br />\\"Don't Let Me Wait To Long\\" is the most Beatle-esque tune on here. Why George didn't release it as a single is beyond me, as this shining example of polished pop would have definitely made the top-ten.<br />\\"Who Can See It\\" is truly a gorgeous song. With some incredible singing and a majestic melody, this piece is truly a highlight of Harrison's career. A beautiful song.<br />The title track is an eccentric hybrid of rowdy romp & mystical confessional. I'm not really big on \\"rock sax\\", but it works in this context. The \\"spiritual sky\\" refrains are lovely, and George's voice is really strong on this one.<br />\\"The Lord Loves The One..\\" is a funky song that leads the way to Dark Horse & 33 1/3. The lyrics are perhaps a teeny bit hectoring and Bible-beating (or Bhagavad-Gita-beating, if you will), but I'm sure that the believers would happily sing along. The rest of us agnostics can enjoy the fantastic guitar work.<br />\\"Be Here Now\\" is another one of those songs on here that people seem to love or loathe. If you're into Fairport Convention folk, you'll love this. The musical atmosphere is of gentle calm & reflection, and the piece absolutely radiates warmth & grace.<br />\\"Try Some, By Some\\" is a return to the Phil Spector sound world of All Things Must Pass. The production seems jarring compared to the low-key sound of the rest of the album, and, to be honest, I have to wonder why George included it. The song isn't bad by any means, but it's definitely LITMW's sore thumb.<br /><br />\\"The Day The World Gets 'Round\\" is a melodic protest song that bemoans man's inhumanity to man. George caught a lot of flack for this tune's lyrics, and they can come across as pretty self-righteous. I really don't think that they were intended to sound that way. Frankly, George was entitled to his feelings since it took his Bangla Desh benefit concert to finally make people aware of the appalling poverty of underdeveloped nations.<br />\\"That Is All\\" is a gorgeous song that forms the perfect eulogy for George's life. With chiming guitars and a soaring vocal performance, this is the jewell in the crown of Harrison's career. A great performance!<br />I hope Capitol gets around quickly to remastering this masterpiece soon, as well as the rest of George's catalogue.dy, this piece is truly a highlight of Harrison's career.

6304698682|5.0|The situation is familiar enough, previously dramatized in another film, Shane (1953): A stranger appears and becomes involved with good people who are being tormented by a powerful adversary as they struggle to eke out a living as miners camped along a river. Eastwood has duly acknowledged several similarities with Shane while explaining that he wanted to create his own version and commissioned a script based on that basic situation. As for the film's title, as she was reading the Bible with her mother (a widow, played by Carrie Snodgrass), Megan Wheeler (played by Sydney Penny), comes upon this passage: \\"And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was death, and hell followed him.\\" Soon after, a lone horseman (Clint Eastwood) dressed as a preacher, rides into camp. His name is never revealed, nor is his background, but the miners soon realize that the Preacher is probably much handier with a gun than he is with holy scripture. Of course, the confrontation with LaHood and his hired gunmen (led by a man named Stockburn) is inevitable. There is a vague but inescapable implication that the Preacher may have once ridden with Stockburn. There is no doubt that they once knew each other.<br /><br />To his credit, Eastwood underplays any Biblical implications. In fact, most of the action occurs slowly. Opportunities to develop a sub plot are rejected, probably because Eastwood wants to sustain the focus on the conflict between decency and mendacity. Although the widow is obviously \\"taken\\" with the Preacher and he feels at least some attraction to her (as was also the case with Shane and Marion Starret), the Preacher rides off as the film ends, as does Shane. Hull Barret is Joe Starret's counterpart. Both are willing but neither is equal to the challenge of saving their friends from oppression. Shane and the Preacher become involved because they care about the good folks, of course, but also because (it is implied) their destiny is to confront and eliminate evil, then depart. Stockburn is a contract laborer, as is Jack Wilson in Shane. Literally, a hired gun. Nothing personal, although Stockburn (as portrayed by John Russell)  seems to me somewhat world-weary whereas Wilson still seems to enjoy killing whomever he must to complete an assignment.<br /><br />One final point: I have admired as well as enjoyed the development of Eastwood's skills as a director over several decades, beginning with Play Misty for Me (1971). I think there is much greater diversity in his selection and presentation of material as a director than there is as an actor. Some have characterized this as a \\"noir film\\" and in certain respects it is. The somber tone he establishes and then sustains in Pale Rider (1985) may well have contributed to the effectiveness of a comparable tone in later films, notably Unforgiven (1992). I am eager to see what new challenges he takes on in films yet to be directed but I am equally eager to see relationships of those films with earlier works such as this.hen depart.

0385509456|2.0|I'm still scratching my head over this one.  The writing is lovely, and the autistic narrator's voice is fresh, believable, engaging.  So why squander such a fully realized voice in a tired minimal plot populated by poorly drawn characters?  The father, for instance, is key here, but all the author can think of for him to say is variations on, &quot;Oh, [fill in expletive], Christopher.&quot;  The mother and neighbors are also ciphers....and don't tell me this is because of the narrator's unreliable perceptions.  Banal dialogue is banal dialogue whether or not it's being rendered by an unreliable narrator.  Basically, this novel is a case of an author putting a huge amount of work into creating one fine character and his unique voice, and then deciding he didn't need to do any work on other parts of the book.  And the voice is done so well, it's almost worth reading.  Almost.

0380789035|3.0|.. this would be that book. Unfortunately, I already own every other Gaiman work, so this was rather of a retread for me. Just about all of the ideas incorporated into American Gods have already been used elsewhere in his ouvre. The thing is, since most Americans aren't too familiar with graphic novels/comics, they've never read his more prominent work, the mythological excavation/eulogy The Sandman. Neither, apparently, have they read his collaboration with Terry Prachett of several years ago, which tackled the Christian Apocalypse with entertaining aplomb, or the short story \\"Murder Mysteries\\" which covers no less than Creation and the Fall itself. The absence of Christian imagery was almost the only innovation here, considering the way his prose works have been so positively dripping with it. While I don't expect or want Gaiman to abandon his mytho-religious obsessions, it's really too bad that he has to recycle ideas into novel form to get any appreciation for them.<br />Terry Prachett didn't invent the \\"Small Gods\\" concept, incidentally. It's a well-worn idea. See also Tom Robbins' \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\", or the fabulous pulp novel \\"God-Stalk\\" by P.C. Hodgell.<br />Anyway, since the plot has been well described, I will conclude by noting that while there are many terrific set pieces in this novel, they don't quite form a strong whole. Perhaps Gaiman is too enured to episodic storytelling, after years of comics and television series (in which both Stardust and Neverwhere, respectively, debuted). This may also explain his strange reluctance to describe the physical characteristics of his characters. I think Gaiman's a gifted writer who will go far, I just don't think this book is quite up to his level of craft. I almost wish he could move back to Britain and so end the futile and somewhat pretentious task of diagnosing the modern American psyche. His writerly temperment, eloquently dry, sensibly romantic, is more suited to the elder statesman England than the rowdy teenaged America, which hasn't yet settled into itself enough to be definitively defined.teenaged America, which hasn't yet settled into itself enough to be definitively defined.

I've read many books on autism but rarely would I recommend them to someone who was not involved, somehow, with autism.  This book is a great read that anyone would enjoy.  I was spellbound and read it cover to cover in a weekend.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  It is absolutely fascinating.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I've waited for for a long time for the release of The Mars Volta album. And  it was definitely well worth the wait. For those that actually care to listen you really should. It has the intensity of the two founding members former band At The Drive-In with many other musical elements that make this such a great album. If you're a ATDI fan I'd compare this album to Vaya and Relationship in Command pushed to a whole new level. The album is progressive rock but it doesn't suck. There is a awesome new version of \\"Cut The City\\" (now called \\"Cicatriz Esp\\") with new guitar parts from John Frushante of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Flea also plays bass on this cd too. A great ensemble of musicians if you ask me. There are just too many great things to say about this album. Just buy it!

B00008LDPU|4.0|I'll have to admit that this was a stroke of brilliant genius that would undoubtedly be a great seller.  You combine many of the traditional elements that fan-boys hold dear in one package and offer something in addition: CGI, cell animation, manga, the Matrix universe as a common theme, comic-book-like stories, good writing, and most importantly a solid background on what the casual movie watcher may miss--backgrounds and origins of plotlines discussed in the Matrix and Matrix Reloaded.<br />What awaits you and your friends are 9 well thought out and clever short anime movies.  Ranging from 5-15 minutes each, the varying styles of animation here should please just about every anime palette.<br />What I found amongst this DVD's highlighted shorts were:<br />1) The Second Renaissance parts 1 &amp; 2: A great traditional cell film with an awesome backgrounds story that really lays the foundation of events that lead up to the formation of The Matrix.<br />2) Detective Story: A throwback to B&amp;W film noir, the Detective Story does well in developing Trinity in Matrix lore while giving the viewer a taste of pulp movies of the 40's.<br />3) Final Flight of the Osiris: All CG, but a parallel story of another awakened crew running from Sentinels.  The CG work here was phenomenal and really made the Matrix 'hero' universe seem bigger than just Neo and his crew.<br />4) Beyond: A beautifully animated story clearly grounded in Japanese tones unveils the fact that there are some people (notably children) who awaken within the matrix and discover a 'magical zone' in which their dreams come true...but the viewer will discover it is an area within the matrix that is suffering from an internal glitch.  Very deep and a thinking man's short.<br />A requisite documentary adds to the value of the DVD, but it was expected and nothing super special.<br />Animated menu's are always nice, but I found these ones a tad busy and a little overdone.<br />A trailer to a video game that has gotten a lack-luster reviews is not what I call a DVD bonus enhancement.

B00008DDXC|3.0|As someone who, unlike most of my fellow reviewers, actually LIKED the first movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I admit I was disappointed by this movie.   Let's face it: a movie will never be the story the book was, and I suppose this movie is perfect--for people who didn't read the books.<br />My biggest disappointment was how dark this movie was in comparison with the first.  The book wasn't like that-there were so many extraordinarily funny moments in the book, which were reduced in this movie to just a couple sound bites that really failed to do justice to the overall sentiment of the book.  And while many scenes, in spite of differing in small ways from the book's description, were positively perfect (I offer the dueling training scene in defense of this claim), other scenes seemed to favor excitement over accuracy.  In the Quidditch scene, for example, Malfoy is able to keep pace with Harry through some exceptionally difficult flying, and yet, wasn't Malfoy supposed to have made a fool of himself out there on the field?<br />Even if you didn't read the book, while you may enjoy the fast-pace of the movie, you just might find that despite its exceptional length, many of the important discussions were too rushed to the point of almost incomprehensibility (consider Harry's meeting with Tom Riddle at the end).  <BR>As for casting, I loved everyone, as usual.  Beware: Harry and Ron's voices have very much deepened, though you'll grow used to this during the course of the movie.  Lockhart could not have been better cast!  <br />It's worth watching, and I own the DVD-but just make sure you keep your expectations low while you're watching it.

Forget about whether she did or did not write the songs, or whether she can or cannot play.<br />The fact is, this is a strong debut CD, with very little filler.  While some of the lyrics sound like they were written by a 16 year-old (lending support to the argument that she did at least HELP to write the songs), it does not overshadow the fact that the playing is tight and the hooks are catchy.  She handles the ballads and the up-tempo material with equal skill.<br />View this for what it is...a very good POP disc that you should not feel ashamed to own.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.

B000002J03|5.0|Well, this is just 9 songs of pure perfection. This is also Zeppelin's best work, although many people think otherwise. Granted, Led Zepp IV was the FM behemoth and Zeppelin I was the one to start it all, but popularity and being first do not hold up when compared to Led Zeppelin II. This album has the perfect mix of blues/rock/metal that all of the bands other releases can't match up to. The entire album flows together so well, nothing is out of place. One reviewer said that \\"Thank You\\" didn't fit in to the album too well, I don't see how anyone could think that. The song itself is one of the most emotional songs they came out with, and it is just so beautiful. Zeppelin II \\"is\\" all emotion, and that is what makes it so great. Love seemed to be be fueling the inspration for this album, and it shows. That isn't what makes this album so great though, it's the fact that all the band mates were right on with each other. Plant's vocals, Page's guitars, and Bohnam & Jones' rythym came together so seamlessly on this album... it's incredible. I'm amazed that four people could get together and create such a wonderfull piece of work. The music world has yet to put out anything that can be on the same level as this album. Then again, the music world has yet to match the excellence of Led Zeppelin. I could go on for hours about how good this album is, but I don't want to ramble on for too much longer. If you're a die hard Zeppelin fan then I'm sure you agree with me, and if you're a new-comer to the Zeppelin phenomenon, then this is the album to start with.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I think this a great album everyone should own, But I think White blood cells is much better. Buy one of them. The White stripes are a wonderful duo. Everyone should own one of there albums.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Based upon the real-life experience of artist Julio Venegas, an artist and close friend of TMV's founders Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez (previously of At the Drive-In fame), the album imagines a coma-stricken protagonist who drifts through both the positive and negative realms of his own consciousness, only to eventually wake up and commit suicide. <br />The aural equivalent of being struck by lightning, TMV infuse classic rock such as Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd with intense Fugazi-esque hardcore, while adding salsa and latin influences into the mix. Imagine Dark Side of the Moon on speed ('Haunt of Roulette Dares'), climatic Zeppelin sexuality in bloom ('Drunkship of Lanterns'), with Early Santana coming in to jam along ('Cicatriz, Take the veil Cerpin Taxt'), while Alec Empire sprinkles distorted, jangled noise beats and samples on top, and a gorgeous IMAX print of '2001: A Space Odyssey' plays in front of it all. This is, simply put, the best rock album I've heard in ages, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who is drawn to intense, energetic, passionate and visceral music. This is an album that tells a story, paints a cereberal and emotional landscape, while remaining unencumbered by a label or definitive genre. It merges musics and bridges ideas with the kind of fresh vitality and exuberance that the world hasn't heard since... well, since the early 90s, simply put. While it might not make a huge commercial splash (and maybe that's not such a bad thing), it certainly provides a beacon of light, a bit of hope for the future of expressive rock music.
0452282152|5.0|A talented but lazy portrait painter in 17th century Holland realizes he needs a helper but is reluctant to hire anyone, lest his secret color formulas be discovered.  His ambitious mother-in-law, who lives with his ever-growing family, decides his wife could use another maid/laundress.  So the painter, a local known as Vermeer, hires a young girl of 14. The daughter of a blinded unemployed tile painter, she brings a treasure trove of skills with her.  Only no one may know she helps the master.<br />The painter's struggles of getting a painting right, coupled with his daily distractions of his ever pregnant jealous wife, sneaky mother-in-law and nearly a dozen children  provide the reader with a glimpse of how life was conducted in a Dutch manor house of the 1600's.  Told from the maid's point of view, a young girl is sent away from her family to live her life in servitude to the painter.  She proves herself in more ways than one.  Love, deceit, art history and romance make this book a keeper. <BR>I wish it was another two hundred pages!
B000099T2L|3.0|I am a fan of Destiny child's music and some of the girls solo acts, but this was a little disappointing.  This is the first day I had the cd and maybe it will grow on me, but there really is no body to this album.  One thing that threw me was Beyonce's decision to write more about sex on this album.  She is a beautiful young woman, but each song was about oooooooooh......touch me here and oooooooooooooh the way you make me feel when you.......oooooooooooh how do you like this ......I can be your nasty girl tonight.  I know sex sales but, it got old pretty quick.  I am giving this album 3 stars because Beyonce is a very talented young woman and I know that this is only the beginning of her solo career.  She was very involved with this album and that is an endeavor for a young artist like her.  I also give props to her for keeping it in the family(her Mom is the stylist and her Dad is an executive producer).  If you are interested in buying the album, go on and support the sista, but be sure to listen to it first.
B000084T18|3.0|To Sinsiter and Jazzm, your lack of experience with hip-hop culture keeps you from enjoying this album. Your musical tastes are fine with me, but reviewing an album with a metal fan perspective makes your reviews sound ridiculous. The fact that one hip-hop artist has been shot more than the next one is irrelevant to the music. Besides, focusing on commercial artists such as Puff Daddy in order to compare to 50 Cent proves that you do not have enough knowledge about hip-hop artists in the underground to feel as though you know the genere's basic content and music. KRS-One, The Roots, Cannibal Ox, Talib Kweli, GZA, many more you don't know of. Sinister, the dramatic impersonation of a rap fan is unacceptable. Especially when it sounds more like Limp Bizkit than anything. Jazz, in order to review this album, you need to acutally listen with an open mind. Until you have done that, you have no right to make any comment (positive or negitive) about \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\". Of course, rap may not be your type of music (which you have already proven), so with that, I do not recommend this to fans of metal. <br />50 Cent is not a good rapper, in fact, his lyrics are some of the most godawful stuff I've ever heard. It's the production that carries this album, and the guest appearences as well. That sums up the album.<br />I will repeat myself, if you are primarily a metalhead, you are not going to like this. If you are one of these metalheads, have listened to \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" with an open-mind, then you have the right to make any opinion you want about it. But don't waste your time writing unresearched garbage.<br />If you like this album, I would also recommend Mase's \\"Double Up\\", Fabolous's \\"Ghetto Fabolous\\" and (for more healthy listening) KRS-One's \\"The Sneak Attack\\".<br />Overall: 3 stars
B000002GA8|4.0|I loved this album, but then again, I love Wakeman's work. If you are a fan of ostentacious progressive rock - as I am - you should love this album. It may seem a bit over the top to some listeners, but if you really love music, and give it a chance, I really believe the stuff will grow on you.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is really good!  Been a true fan of Beyonce and Destiny's Child since the beginning.  Her album shows that sista girl has grown up.  LOL  Here's my comments and ratings for each song.<br />- Crazy in Love (10/10) great song for her debut<BR>- Naughty Girl (9/10) cool<BR>- Baby Boy (10/10) nice song with Sean Paul<BR>- Hip Hop Star (7/10) it's ok<BR>- Be with you (9/10) nice slow jam<BR>- Me, Myself and I (9/10) <BR>- Yes (10/10) pretty nice beat<BR>- Signs (10/10) Missy knows how to do it!  <BR>- Speechless (6/10) really slow and drawn out, cool though<BR>- That's How You Like It (8/10) its ok,<BR>- The Closer I get to you (9/10) great collaboration with the legendary Luther Vandross<BR>- Dangerously in Love 2 (8/10) should have left the original version from last DC album, love the song though.<BR>- Gift From Virgo (8/10) cool ending<BR>- Daddy - Bonus Track (9/10) nice tribute to her dad.<br />Overall it's a good album.  Even if you're a Beyonce hater, just accept that she's a great writer and producer.  She's really good.  Great work!!  Hope it helps
B00005RIKD|5.0|I always enjoy relaxing music like always.  Listening t  Sting to  &quot;All this Time &quot;  was splendid and superb!   Always always will listen to relaxing and mellow music of saxophone musics.  They hit the &quot;right nerve&quot;  to unwind me down at the end of a long hectic day or during a hectic day.  bye,  flustered.
B0000A36J5|5.0|This collector's edition gift set of \\"The Two Towers\\" will be similar in quality to the gift set produced for \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  It will include the 4 disc Platinum series extended DVD (anamorphic widescreen with DTS, four commentaries, and hours of other extras), a collectible sculpture of Gollum from Weta/Sideshow, and a special bonus 5th DVD from Weta focusing entirely on the development and creation of CGI Gollum for the film.  This all comes in special packaging featuring the artwork of Alan Lee.
B00005RIKD|5.0|I totally enjoy the Sax part. Totally relaxing.  My nerves are shot and go down the drain listening to this fine quality good music or yes, music ,  no singing involved.  I am totally enveloped into this superb music.  bye,  flustered.   keep up the good music!!!!
B000002TQV|4.0|The Bends is deservedly regarded as one of the greatest albums of the past decade. Thom's vocals are just gut-wrenching, and all the many different aural pleasures that are fused together on The Bends render a truely classic recording. In my opinion, Radiohead's most alluring aspect is not their incredible ingenuity or their ethereal musicianship. I believe Radiohead is Radiohead because of candor. Thom sings about what he believes in, and it comes off so free of pretention and so full of vehemence and meaning that you can't help but empathize. Sincere music fans who appreciate brilliant musicianship and deep, thoughtful lyrics can't go wrong with getting a Radiohead album.
0060194995|5.0|As a lawyer and writer born before the first edition of this book was published, I'm embarrassed to say I never read To Kill a Mockingbird until the fortieth anniversary edition came out (even my fifteen-year-old had read it). But I'm glad I waited. I don't think I would have enjoyed or appreciated it nearly as much in my youth. What a treat! <br />The book starts slowly, but draws the reader in by the end of the first chapter. Without exception, the characters are intriguing. Scout, the young girl who narrates the story, is a particularly compelling and sympathetic character. Author Harper Lee gives her a youthful perspective without patronizing. <br />The story is enlightening and entertaining. It accomplishes these dual feats with minimal moralizing. A few passages did make me cringe, such as the \\"enlightened\\" neighbor's there-but-for-the-grace-of-God thankfulness that she wasn't born black. But I suspect those passages reflect the views of the period, and are as instructive as the story itself.<br />No need to say the writing is masterful; the Pulitzer Prize gives away that little secret. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Atticus Finch is called out to confront a rabid dog. It's as chilling and suspenseful as anything in today's movies -- without the gore and unnecessary violence. <br />To Kill a Mockingbird reflects the best and worst of American sensibilities in the twentieth century. We would do well to remember its lessons in the twenty-first.<br />Harper Lee was right in insisting against a long introduction to the fortieth anniversary edition; this American classic stands on its own.
0736041850|5.0|&quot;Strength Training Anatomy&quot; covers all the exercises for every significant muscle group in the body with color illustrations showing proper form and which muscles are used with each exercise. It also covers free weights and most of the more popular Nautilus/Hammer machines. For many exercises, it also includes the subtle variations that can be done with certain exercises (for example, using a wide/narrow grip or stance) and tells how the muscles being worked are differently impacted by these variations.<br />Note that this book does not provide a workout or diet plan. It's main purpose is to serve as an illustrated reference guide so you can map out which muscle groups you'd like to target with which exercises. If you actually need a roadmap to setting up a routine, I'd personally recommend &quot;Weight Training Workouts that Work&quot; by Orvis or some other lifting guide in addition to this book. But the Delavier book is a great reference and can give some ideas of different lifts to try if you find yourself growing bored with your current routine.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I really don't like The Strokes. I don't like the fact that the receive so much attention because of their &quot;cool factor&quot; and not really because of their musical abilities. The long, seemingly unwashed hair, All-star sneakers, torn blue jeans, leather jackets, and smug grins...a shudder runs down my spine. It would make me very happy to see them get some sense smacked into their pseudo-hipster heads. However, as much as I hate these posers, I can't argue with this CD. It's good. Don't expect this album to contain complex, revolutionary music, because you won't find it. You will find, however, some very catchy, very good little diddies that are great when you just want to groove. <BR>Granted, about every song on this album is very simple and very similar, but distinct and lively enough to make them very good as well. &quot;The Modern Age,&quot; &quot;Last Nite,&quot; and of course &quot;Someday,&quot; are some of the better songs I've heard recently. There really isn't a throwaway on this album--if a song's not &quot;good&quot; it's decent enough  to listen to. If you just want some simple songs to listen to while driving or some other tedious task that can be livened with music, I would suggest this album. Don't believe the hype, but don't ignore the band either, even if they are a bunch of softy posers who have probably never worked for anything in their overpriveleged lives.
B00007KWHP|5.0|A great album by one of the best rock bands of all time. A masterpiece. Beautiful and timeless. For anyone interested in expanding their mind, and/ or music awareness this is the rock album to start with. I have the 1990's remaster and am very happy with it. I do understand that as time rolls on there will be better technology to enhance albums. I am however not rich and there are so many remastered Cd's coming out that I can't decide what to get. This might be one in the near future but for now the music speaks for itself. Actually, this is one of those album where you could play an old beat up record and it would blow away 99% of the music coming out today. If you don't have it, pick it up, get the headphones out and be prepared for a stellar journey of musical genius.
B000002NJS|5.0|This CD was not only a musical change but a emotional change for Madonna as well. Most of the tracks lyrics and beats are very techno. She made four videos from this album. Ray of Light won her a grammy.
B00005JKZV|1.0|This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Tolken's The Lord of the Rings.  I've never been so disappointed in my life.
0792839749|1.0|Do NOT purchase this wonderful and immensly satsifying movie on DVD! It's ONLY available in Pan-and-Scan, the worst sort of way to view a movie in it's purest! Buy the new and improved anniversary edition DVD which, aside from all the usual bells 'n' whistles, is in the letterboxed format and THE only way to truly enjoy this movie.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta live up to the hype that has been brewing from the moment At the Drive In split. There is a sense of freedom and raw energy in this album that keeps you thinking how talented these guys are. This is a must have for any Inie rock fan. I wont be surprised if these guys become huge. Just to add you must see their show they'll blow you away.
B000002I25|5.0|First imagine a quartet with Bach on keyboards, a clever poet taking vocals, an acid-crazed flamenco bluesman on guitar, and a jazz drummer. Now imagine this quartet hitting some kind of insane sexual/ecstatic peak in 1967. There you have it. If you've never heard it, do. If you have, listen to it again and appreciate a peak the rock genre only reached on five or six occasions.<br />One thing I sorely miss in today's rock are lyrics that make you think--this album's got those up the wazoo.  The modest frontman's got a great sultry voice that can Bend in ways that make even banal lyrics mystic and suggestive, and it's even better on the intelligent lines.  This forgotten, underappreciated frontman was a master of well-chosen details.  Well, another thing I miss in today's rock is long songs that suck you in, take you to another world, that you can get up and walk around in, see the sights and smell the odors of so to speak.  \\"The Doors\\" has at least two such songs.  \\"Light My Fire\\" is a stoned fireworks show.  If you don't start air-keyboarding to the organ solo, you ain't got a pulse.  \\"The End\\" is an entire universe that exists only within the words and music of this one song.  The best example of abstract poetry I have ever heard, and great 60s-style sexual innuendo all over it.  The above-mentioned acid-crazed guitarist plays minimalist sitar-esque lines that put efficient shivers in my spine.  A lesson to today's guitar-bashers: Five seconds of well-chosen silence trumps three minutes of uninterrupted sonic assault, any day of the week.<br />One thing you have to wonder--what would The Doors' music impart today if the frontman had been ugly?
038572179X|2.0|This was my first Ian McEwan book and it was such a slow read for me. Ian describes EVERYTHING in too much detail for my taste. I was impatient to get on with the story. I realize this descriptiveness is what appeals to others. I wouldn't recommend this book.
0131101633|3.0|This book is a good reference manual for C programming, but it <BR>should not be the book from which you learn C. I tried, but as<BR>a result, I find it very frustrating writing simple programs. I'd call it &quot;C For Geniuses&quot; or &quot;C For Those Who Already Know C&quot;. I agree that I've eventually found everything I've needed to know in this book, but the problem can be digging it out. Everything is distilled down into as little space as possible, and very often, programs are used as examples to explain a particular point. I don't appreciate having to plow through some code to figure out how to use pointers or whatever. I need more description, such as, for example, why pointers can be cast to &quot;void&quot; and back without losing information; this is just stated in a single sentence and shown in a fairly complicated program. That isn't good enough for me. I need this information at a more basic, descriptive level. Anyhow, since I'm clearly a dummy when it comes to programming, I've ordered C For Dummies. Maybe that's what I need to get the most out of not only C, but out of this book as well.
B000002H6C|5.0|&quot;...And Justice For All&quot; follows the same structural pattern as &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; and &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot;: side one consists of the fast opener, epic title track, sludgy slower third tune, and the powerful ballad. Side two invariably ends with a combination of a long instrumental and another fast thrasher.  Yep, the good old days.<br />Buy this album.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat contains two of the greatest actors that the world has ever known, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro. These two alone make the movie buy worthy. The plot, acting, I loved everything about this movie. If you haven't seen it, I suggest that you do.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Well, I'd like to give it 4.5 stars but I can't so I'll go with 5 since it's so great.. I love every song but there are maybe 1 or 2 that aren't the best. So here goes!<br />Foreword (8/10) not a 10 outta 10 cause it's just an intro but it goes really well into Don't Stay, I didn't even know they were seperate until I looked at the back and saw that this is a song of it's own... kinda...<br />Don't Stay (9/10) I LOVE the beginning of the song, the guitars and the... thing that you spin and scratch.. it sounds great! But Chester's singing in this song is [...]! cept for the chorus part.<br />Somewhere I Belong (9/10) Gotta love the video, most of the video is good except for the part where it's obvious it's only a cardboard picture of chester falling on the bed.. The song is awesome but I think they over did it a little... I want to heal.. I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed.. just a little too much.<br />Lying from you (9/10) Awesome song!! Words fit together well, but the part where chester is singing and then has to practically belch out the first word of the chorus.. it sounds worse when it's live, but really great song!<br />Hit The Floor (7/10) This is one of the songs that I didn't really like that much, sounds like a good song to scream to though.<br />Easier to run (9/10) The beginning chords are nice, then the song starts out at the chorus which I didn't like very much but the verses and the choruses after that are beautiful.<br />Faint (10/10) I heard this one first cause my friend told me this was his favorite, and it instantly drew me in.. a good song to work out to. Perfect!<br />Figure (10/10) My second favorite! The beginning is just right to slightly move to, then it gets a little heavier and you move a little more to it. <br />Breaking The Habit (10/10) My favorite! I love this song, I would some day love to recompose it and sing this song myself. This song can be concieved many ways, and the other night I got a realisation ofwhat this song means to me, its gorgeous.<br />From the inside (8/10) this is a weird song, sometimes I love it, and sometimes I dont. at the moment it's another one of the songs I dont like too much, kind of sounds like they forced this one together.. wasn't meant to be!!<br />Nobody is Listening (8/10) this is a really really different song, I think most people would like it because of the base lines but not too sure.<br />Session (10/10) this song is on the matrix soundtrack! and it's great, a good song to play at a rave (never been to one but..) it's just instrumentals which is a nice change.<br />Numb (10/10) My second favorite song also.. Chester has a really beautiful voice, and it shows very well in this song it's a great way to end the CD. A good song to cry to when needed, a good song to relate to.
B00005JLPK|3.0|First off,this is a DVD review not a film commentary.<BR>This DVD release was a disappointment. I loved the film. It had great acting, beautiful cinematography, well written and well... it was just plain good. I say the DVD was disappointing for numerous reasons. First of it appears that the two disc set is offering you a lot of additional information. What it is actually offering is a lot of fluff. The extras contain absolutely nothing about the real life character that the film was about. The only information we get about the real Frida was a quick walkthrough of the Blue house. It would have been nice to get even a brief photo documentary highlighting her life. Another thing I was hoping to see on the DVD release was an art gallery of Frida's work.  You would figure that a film about the artist would at least show her work on the DVD release. To me the extras were more about stroking the filmmaker's egos on a job well done than to honor the person the film was about.<BR> This release is also a huge slap in the face to Spanish speaking buyers. Frida was a Mexican Icon, yet Miramax felt that the DVD release didn't need a Spanish language track. The release is only in English and French. Now does it make sense to honor Frida and neglect her native language on the DVD? I find it insulting, and I am not even Mexican.  <BR> To get down to it, the DVD is beautifully packaged but it is only a gilded wrapping.  I expected more from a two-disc set than what I got. This release definitely does not do honor to the person from whose life they are profiting from. Don't get me wrong the film alone is worth picking up the DVD. But why should I have to pay for an extra disc that essentially is nothing more than the filmmakers patting themselves on the back?<BR>   If your going to buy it get it for the movie, not the supplements.
B000065V3M|5.0|I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan and even though ED WOOD is not my favorite movie or Johnny movie..I still love it. Mainly because it is his best acting performance to date. He is amazing in this...he is gold. Untouchable. You don't even know it's him. Wow. See it!!!
B000002H33|5.0|This is the pinicale of Metallica, there other albums (not the new junk) are very good also, but this is the best Metallica could do, if you say you are a metal fan and don't own this ablum, go buy it NOW!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I enjoyed the whole collection. Each, in their own right, was a great piece of cinamatography. The only thing that I don't understand is how some people could call godfather 3 the worse. It ended the trilogy, and the way it ended, it was an emotionaly cinamatic moment.(If you haven't seen the movie don't read this last part.)  At the end, everyone thought that they were going to kill Mike, but instead they killed his daughter, who would have expected that to happen. And the, it shows him sitting alone in Sicily and he dies. his first wife was murdered in Sicily and so was his daughter. This left him alone, he died without anyone by his side. If that isn't an epic moment when he falls off of the chair, then I don't know what is.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Mars Volta is awesome. I am not a fan of the heavy music, and this is HEAVY. The song writing is very intellegent. the music changes tempo every minute, and the band is tight on the changes also. Rick Ruebens production on this is the best. They are a very original band. Check it out.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an amaziningly refreshing sound, the words are full of depth and soul, and the music is fabulous, could listen to it endlessly.  For true music afficianados, enjoy...
B00008S2VG|4.0|I am a loyal fan of Madonna and have been for about 20 years. Mostly I love her for her style and love her as an entertainer.  I always look forward to anything new she releases and with \\"American Life\\" she didn't disappoint me, actually she rarely disappoints me.  Don't get me wrong I can be really critical about what she puts out there but as a true fan I still love her for it.  The album is really groovy in an interesting way, funny that but you do have to listen to it a few times to truely appreciate it.  With everything she does it always takes me a while to get into it, so I never judge it straight away.  And it is a shame that people out there are missing the point with this album.<BR>So after a few listens I can honestly say that this a good album, not a great one like \\"Like a Prayer\\" and Ray of Light\\" but would be her third best album ever released.<BR>The highlights are the commercial sounding tunes such as \\"Hollywood\\" \\"Love Profusion\\", \\"Intervention\\" and my personal favourite \\"Nothing Fails\\" I personally think if this song gets enough airplay on radio it could be another number 1 hit for her.  Everytime I hear \\"Nothing fails\\" I think of her love for Guy \\"it was not a chance meeting, feel my heart beating, YOUR THE ONE!!  Really this album is quite different to her others and is full of love songs.  <BR>If you are a true madonna fan aged over 25 what are you waiting for go and buy a copy (because you can't download one hahaha) you will not be disappointed.<BR>Madonna, you are still the bombdigity!!!
B000099T2L|3.0|The long-awaited solo debut from Destiny's Child's lead singer Beyonce Knowles is a great collection of uptempo dance tracks with hot beats and slow, sweet ballads. I'm not really feelin' her first single, &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; but the other tracks are awesome. With help from music artists such as Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, and Luther Vandross, this album is sizzling and electrifying..and a definite chart-topper!
B00008DDXC|4.0|The second installment in the Harry Potter Series is this DVD adapted from the book of the same name.  Most people know the story of Harry Potter- he is an orphan boy whose parents were killed by an evil wizard when he was just a baby.  Harry finds out he is a wizard also and is taken to wizard school.  Hogwarts is being terrorized by a mysterious monster who lives in the chamber of secrets and harry must do find out how to save his friends who have been petrified by the monster.  This is a simplied plot but the beauty of this DVD is many.<br />1.  Faithfulness to the book- Harry potter fans will not be disappointed.  The scenes in this book are awesome, bringing to life the unique world of HP.<br />2.  Lots of DVD extras- including a brief synopsis of Year one, spellcasting, extra scenes etc<br />3.  Crazy enchanting characters- like Dobby the house elf,<br />This DVD seemed geared for kids, but adult fans of the series will enjoy this film adaptation- but as always, the book is better--read the book first!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Its a total throwback to classic bands such as Pink Floyd, Santana, and Led Zepplin, fused with the abrasive style of playing that you would expect from any band involving Omae and Cedric. This cd is also very jam oriented, with a lot of areas open for improvisation. Its definately not as structured as the songs of tremulant ep. In short, this cd is amazing and one of the best cds of 2003.
0316666343|1.0|The book was disjointed, cliched, and maudlin.  Sebold writes like a one-dimensional Alice Hoffman.  I couldn't wait to get through the stupid thing.
B00003CXIP|4.0|I thought that this was a great moving about children coming of age and learning about the difficulties of adult life. It has some deep and meaningful themes and to truly understand the film you would need to watch it more than once. But it still is a great movie if you want some cheap laughs. All the characters are excellently portrayed which makes all the events believable. The film very easy to watch and you aren't forced to cringe at the attempts of humour committed by the cast. I believe the settings and the storyline play an important part in this movie and even though I had to watch this movie in an English class I would still watch it again. The camera angles and screen play help to accentuate the authentic feel of this extremely well made movie.
B000089RVX|5.0|Nearly every song is a hit in it's own right. Bring me to life is an infectious blend of rock and powerful vocals where as hello is a emotional song. Fallen is a truly steller album which totally deserves it's No.1 spot in the charts. Fallen is a must have...BUY!!!
B00004STPT|5.0|A film of such enormity and power needed a musical score to rival that of Morricone's great works.  It is very hard to say whether the film would be as good with a lesser score, but even without the film, the soundtrack is a superb piece of standalone music. Ridley Scott uses his visual tricks and palette to create films that are beautifully aesthetic.  Zimmer parallels Scott in the musical domain with sonic images and sketches.  Like Scott you witness vignettes that are different in style to the backdrop of the music (the way that Holst is mixed with North African themes is similar to the way that Scott mixed 1930s retro with science fiction in Bladerunner). Such oddities make the music that much more interesting and provide both style and substance.  The closing tracks co-penned by Lisa Gerrard (of Dead Can Dance fame) are the type that send shivers down your spine for their simple beauty and I will often just play these - I am only disappointed that they are so brief. Needless to say that I enjoyed the film but I am not often moved to buy the soundtrack, but this time I had the soundtrack within days of seeing this great film.  An epic film of a genre we rarely see these days and a score that more than does it credit.  Well done Mr Scott, Mr Zimmer et al.
6302820448|5.0|One of the most clever comedies out there. I bought this movie simply because it is one of those clean comedies that is funny and sends a good message. It is the type of movie that you can watch, then put on the shelf awhile, and then watch again at a later time. This movie did not get a lot of attention when it came out, but I think this might be Bill Murray's funniest role because it captures the very nature of his cynicism that he is accustomed to producing in movies. It also stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot. <br />Bill Murray plays a meteorologist that gets stuck reliving the same day over and over again. At first he thinks he's going nuts, but eventually becomes accustomed to this day, and tweaks each &quot;new&quot; day a little differently until he figures out how to &quot;solve&quot; his problems and attitude on life.  <br />This movie also makes you, as a viewer, think a little bit about how you would handle such a situation. Are there things we take for granted? What would you correct in your own life if you had to live the same day over and over again? Great story and plot idea, and this movie is suitable for any age level.
0140177396|5.0|there is a scene in this book that has affected the way I look at life ever since reading it.  the lesson steinbeck would like readers to understand is displayed in the early scene where a worker's dog must be put to death.  the man loves his dog and faithful companion like no one else on this earth, and when the dog is so old he is suffering all the time, the man is too weak to carry out the painful deed of killing his best friend to ease his suffering.  the man has someone else take the dog out to a field to shoot him, and he feels guilty because his best friend had to look into a stranger's eyes while meeting his death.  he failed to uphold his responsibility to the dog- who was unfailingly faithful to him.  <BR>this lesson is echoed in the final climactic scene in the novel between two men:  one who must prevent the suffering of his completely faithful and innocent companion.  this man, though, faces his responsibilities with strength, and steinbeck would like people to understand this concept of morality.  i do - the lesson was not lost on me, and i appreciate and adhere to this lesson everyday...  if taken with thoughtfulness, this is a highly recommended American classic.
B00005JKPG|5.0|I never had anything to do with X-Men comics or cartoons and I only liked the first one.  But this one was INCREDIBLE and I am now a huge fan of both movies!  Unlike the disappointing Hulk (bad movie) and even the fragile Spider-man story, X-Men brigs true human issues to the big screen and almost can be taken out of the comic book genre because it seems so much more than that.  Don't waste your money on mindless ridiculous movies like Hulk, instead get a movie that you know you will enjoy.  THe interaction between the characters is great.  Each has something great to do.  Women take a fornt seat as Storm, Jean Grey, and Mystique are the major stars of the movie.  Wolverine and Magneto play awesome roles and although Professor X's role may be smaller than in the first, it is much more important to the story of the film.  The new X-Men just get cooler and cooler, bringing Nightcrawler, Deathstrike, Iceman, and Pyro to the scene.  Also, Rogue and Cyclops are back, although with smaller roles, they have their moments.  The action in non-stop and fantastic from Wolverine's rage on the school invasion to Storm and Jean piloting the X jet away from incoming missles.  THe opening scene with Nightcrawler is not easily forgotten and shows Bryan Singer's true talent.  The nemesis is fantastic and seeing the X-Men together in a fragile relationship is a joy to watch.  Get this movie!  Get X-Men 1 too!  Its a saga you won't want to miss!
B000002NIW|5.0|There's really no other words to describe this album other than Amazing or Unbelievable. Its definetly the Deftones best work to date although the other 3 albums are amazing as well. The production is perfect, Terry Date who has recorded with Pantera and countless others really finds the Deftones at their finest moment. \\"Mx\\" is probably my favorite song of all time, again, production is perfect, Chino's melodies are as sexy as Carmen Electra making out with Pamela Lee, and Steph's guitar riffs will blow you away and the sweet serenading between Chino and Drummer Abe Cunningham's wife in the chorus will make you want to grab any girl and bring her to the bathroom for a quickie. Definetly a stellar song. Even the secret track is awesome. <br />A must have for anyone who enjoys music, This album turned me onto metal and hardcore back in 1997 and I haven't looked back since.

0066620996|2.0|It was an easy read, but you can only take little from this book.  I know a lot of people put a lot of stock in this book and attempt to model organizations after this teaching, so I decided to read it.  I was let down quite a bit.  Most of the highlights were obvious(i.e. surround yourself with good people, grow a company slowly), and a lot of them I didn't agree with.  I felt like most of the time they would have an idea and mold their research findings to support their preconceived notions.  As I read the book I kept shaking my head and thinking that their findings could be the result of other factors that weren't touched on.  This book was not worth the read.  They obviousely had business ideas and principles, then set out to find research that would support it, and discard any that wouldn't support it.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Kim Hughes hit the review square on the head (Nice one ;0). Queens is one of few rocking without allegiance. They each play their instruments, and they make it do things most &quot;rock&quot; bands have forgotten how to do. This cd, along with everything back to Beaver, Kyuss, and that whole incestual posse of musicians is breathing a breathe of fresh air back into things. Not for everyone, but one of those cds that will definetly grow on the right people.
0385507755|4.0|I found Frey's style to be refreshing, unconventional, and straightforward.  <BR>     There are inconsistencies in this book, however, that detract from the sense that I am reading raw truth.  Minute details are recounted with vivid imagery--yet one can't help but wonder how Frey's memory has stayed so firmly intact after the toxic amount of chemicals he claims to have put into his body.  It is as though he wished to portray himself as the single worst case of addiction in the history of man, to form his words so that any other severe case of addiction would pale in comparison to his, at any cost, and with extensive help of a thesaurus.<BR>     Overall, his story is believable.  I would give this book to any naieve person who think drugs and alcohol are glamourous.  I honestly think twice now before I mix a drink--this book has haunted me long after the last page.
B000000SHJ|3.0|Boxed sets of Beethoven -- whether symphonies, piano sonatas, or, as here, string quartets -- are a mixed bag. No one artist or group has the capacity to handle all of Beethoven's broad spectrum of expression equally well, so no one artist performs each of the pieces equally well. On the plus side, a truly great artist or group will give us a consistent lens on the pieces, a point of view which illuminates what others miss. The Vermeer are a well-disciplined group with an almost uncanny ability to sound like a single player. They are intelligent musicians, especially strong in conveying the logic and architecture of the piece, and they are meticulous and technically flawless. They have excellent command of dynamic range and tonal shading. And Shmuel Ashkenasy sounds passionate enough.  If this were the only complete set of the Beethoven quartets, it would be a superior effort.  But there is something missing.  For all the apparent passion, there is a detached, uninvolved quality about these performances. Some of this may be the sound: Teldec's recording is detailed, with the requisite wide dynamic range, but it is also tight, airless, and unflattering. Curiously, the recording sounds \\"flat\\" at lower volumes and only takes on life with the volume cranked up a bit. But I suspect it is also a problem with the group itself.  One problem is that the uniformity of tone works against them, creating a surface sheen that suggest lack of depth.  Even the beautifully-proportioned phrasing, especially evident in the late quartets, is sometimes just too beautiful, and lacking that extra, probing quality that gives Beethoven's late works their spiritual power. <br />Given the Vermeer's strength in conveying musical structure, the early quartets ought to be strong, and while they are well-played, there is an almost humorless, dour quality about them. The first Rasumovsky quartet is a big disappointment, as well played as it is, and the slow movement in particular, for all its obvious passionate sound, is unaffecting and seems to lack emotional depth.  The other middle quartets are well played, but only op 95 rises to an intensity of emotional expression that got me really involved.  Similar problems occur in the late quartets, although these, as a group, the best of the set.  Op. 132 starts off well, but the slow movement just doesn't breathe. The Vermeer's penchant for a nearly vibrato-less sound in softer dynamics works well, but the pacing is somewhat wooden and there is no space left between the phrases. The best performances are the op 131, where the Vermeer's understanding of musical structure makes for a beautifully-proportioned reading  (although even here, however, the scherzo seems to lack humor and bite); op 130, which is ravishingly played, each phrase beautifully balanced and seamlessly integrated into the musical structure, but, again, just that little bit removed; and op 135, which may be the best performance of them all -- seamless, flowing, and just plain beautiful.  <br />Overall, the difficulties the Vermeer have with the Beethoven quartets is one which I frequently associate with Karajan, whose performances can sound extraordinary on first hearing but don't stand up on rehearing because of that emphasis on gorgeous playing and a homogenized sound, no matter what the music requires, and a tendancy to stand a bit aloof.  Some may find themselves in harmony with this; I find myself wanting more.<br />If you have heard only these performances, and if you appreciate dedicated and beautiful playing, they would be satisfying. However, there is a whole world of emotional and spiritual depth here that the Vermeer misses, and other performances, particularly by the Talich, Quartetto Italiano, Emerson, Lindsay, and (if you can bear the intonation problems -- I can't) Vegh Quartets, go that extra distance and bring us into Beethoven's spiritual world of music. All in all, a well-played and earnest effort but ultimately a disappointment. You can do better, and, I suspect, so can the Vermeer.
0385504209|3.0|This was a fun summer page-turner novel - quite suspenseful.  It was griping, partially because of the suspense and plot developments - but maybe mostly because of the fascinating things I learned, page after page, about history.  I mean surprising and maybe shocking history!  In fact this book is EXTREMELY provocative, especially for Christians ... if you take it seriously.  Much in the book is about real-life organizations, events, facts, etc., but I'm highly skeptical of a number of aspects of it.  The entertaining thing is trying to figure out what is true and what is fanciful, conspiracy-theory type creative thinking.  Though this book was fun, fascinating and educational, I have to add the negative side:  the WRITING is TERRIBLE.  I found it laughable in quite a few parts!!  It's SO terse, with NO inner character development, and NO emotion.  An example is the grade-school-level effort at developing romance between two of the characters - this consisted of only about 5 sentences out of 454 pages!  I know not to expect much writing syle in this genre, but this was really bad.  Still a fun read, though!
0783211856|3.0|I read that Dancer in the Dark Danish director Lars von Trier was blamed by American critics for setting his movie in the US while he'd never set a foot there. Well, this is pretty much the feeling a European gets when watching this live reconstitution of WW2 in Germany for CNN. All these German officers speaking English and acting SO American... Like \\"John Wayne vs Hitler\\"...<BR>I must admit I'm a little unfair: Mr Spielberg did make an effort here. He's trying to recreate some of Visconti's magic (see \\"the Damned\\"), and to set aside much of his Hollywoodness. The result is not quite convincing to me. Don't misunderstand me: this is not an anti-American charge at all: American cinema has been and still is one of the best in the world, and I'm a great consumer of it; but an American movie is never better than when it's set in the US...<BR>I also agree with the reviewer below who stressed how 'inappropriate' it is to produce such conventionnal emotional effects with such tragic historical events...
B00005JKHZ|4.0|Barry Newman found a fan with Vaninshing Point, but there is another film by him that also has excellent stunt work ( and an early appearance of Ben Kingsley) that was made at about the  same time. Check out FEAR IS THE KEY...Newman wears the same blue denim outfit and attitude...and the plot makes sense! These movies are perfect for fans of either one.
B000002N2Z|5.0|Deftones' Adrenaline....quite possibly couldve been the start of a up and coming genre called nu-metal. i rememeber when the Deftones first played Root and Bored at the Roxy in L.A. b4 they releasd the album. i think this album so influencial that w/o this album or the band period, alot of the new bands that are coming in wouldnt be around. i know i wouldnt be playing drum if i didnt hear Abe Cunningham bashing away on the drums in the opening track &quot;Bored&quot;.<br />OK, now to the album. this album is raw, agressive, heavy and at the same time melodic. the opening track &quot;bored' is one of the greatest opening tracks to an album. its up there w/ the likes of Korn's 'Blind'. i think the heavy hitters on the album are Bored, Minus Blindfold, NoseBleed, Root, 7 words, and Engine #9. Root has one of the mosty famous Deftones riffs ever. and Deftones have a way to make a simple, and plain riff sounds awesome (example: Bored)<br />This is an amazing album, probably Deftones' best along w/ ATF. if u have listened to other Deftones tuff and never listened to this album...listen w/ open ears and an open mind. youll be amazed.....
B00005AQGH|5.0|This album was the last that we would hear from Tupac while he was alive.  Although released after his death, his presence was more than felt on this one.  With his combination of prophecy (Blasphemy, Hail Mary), political and social issues (just like daddy, white man's world) and of course battling and anger which is what was expected on here (bomb first, life of an outlaw, against all odds).  This album is filled with hits and also leads on many people to still think he is alive to increase the shock value.  His brilliant use of the metaphor comes on \\"Me and my Girlfriend\\" where he lays down a track about his gun (the girlfriend) and how it will help him survive.  He fires diss rhymes like Mussolini from the balcony on Against all odds and Bomb First where he mentions Nas, Biggie, and Mobb Deep. The Outlaws drop in for the tracks Hail Mary and Life of an Outlaw and help 2pac along with getting his point across.  I especially love the intro because it sets the tone for an extremely dark and gritty album.  This shows you how serious tupac was about the situation and how it affected him.  He still finds time to include more of his political stands on White Man's World.  Also finds time to include a track for the clubs in Toss it Up, one of my favorite tracks.  This classic does not miss by anyone's standards.  This is the last great tupac album that we will ever experience.  If you want real tupac, do not pick up anything after this album.  With the exception of one released album, \\"Until the End of Time\\", they falter badly and are not the real tupac.  This is the real deal.
B00005JKN9|5.0|In regards to the \\"issue\\" of the Director's Cut DVD: Months before Gangs of New York was released in theatres, Martin Scorsese said in several interviews, \\"The version that is screened in theatres is the 'director's cut', and therefore will be no such version released on DVD.\\" In otherwords, what comes on the DVD IS how Scorsese intended it.
0142004235|5.0|A classic in ever sense of the word.  A bit biography and a bit cathartic release, this novel is fantastic.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Deliverance is definitely the heaviest album Opeth has produced, and it's also one of their best.  Peter Lindgren's guitar sounds totally different; it's much heavier, and the sound variation between the electric and acoustic guitars is far more noticeable than in previous albums.  It's not quite as good as Morningrise, but they'll probably never top that one, and this will do good enough to tie for second with Still Life.  The first two songs are the best, but each of the five full-length tracks is of the high standard that we've come to expect from Opeth.  The interlude is pretty good as well.  The drumming is mind-blowing; Lopez really made a name for himself here if he hadn't already.  As far as vocals, well Mikael Akerfeldt has yet to disappoint.  Opeth truly deserves their honorary title of \\"metal's most brilliant band,\\" and they prove that with Deliverance.

B00000DLUV|5.0|This is a sequel to the 2 LP-2 CD set,HERE AT LAST which was recorded in 1976 while the Brothers Gibb promoted their CHILDREN OF THE WORLD album. This live set contains some songs that are on the first live set. They are \\"Jive Talkin'\\",\\"Lonely Days\\",\\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\",\\"You Should Be Dancing\\",\\"Words\\",\\"To Love Somebody\\" and the complete version of \\"Nights On Broadway\\". Also \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\". I would have loved to attend this concert at Las Vegas,Nevada's MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on November 14,1997. This concert lacked the Boneroo Horns,the brass band that had worked with the Bee Gees for many years. The association between the Bee Gees and the brass band might have by this time dissolved. Those are the horns heard in \\"You Should Be Dancing\\". Here,we hear the songs made famous by Barbra Streisand,Dionne Warwick,Kenny Rogers with Dolly Parton,Frankie Valli,Celine Dion and the Bee Gees' late brother Andy. They are,\\"Guilty\\",\\"Heartbreaker\\",\\"Islands In the Stream\\",\\"Grease\\"(Barry's personally penned tune),\\"Immortality\\", and \\"Our Love\\". Except for \\"Guilty\\" and \\"Grease\\",the Bee Gees have recorded their own versions of those songs. But \\"Our Love\\" was recorded for 1979's BEE GEES GREATEST. \\"Our Love\\" is the only song in which we hear the vocals of all four Gibb Brothers(Andy's hit song with the vocals of the other three Gibbs added). This was the only US concert they did while promoting the STILL WATERS album. We hear from that album,\\"Alone\\" and \\"Closer Than Close\\". Maurice Gibb sings lead vocals in the latter. Barry's son Steven participated in this concert. Maurice introduced him to the audience in the VHS video and DVD(not heard on the CD and cassette). Olivia Newton-John even attended this concert. And probably on free admission. A must for all Bee Gees fans.
B000002GQK|5.0|This is probably my favorite collection of Moody Blues songs, although it's the one that's gotten the most flack for its perhaps overly-ambitious approach. I think it's also the most innovative and adventurous of all their albums, with the song-cycle theme over-arching the great individual tracks and tying them all together into one organic whole. Some of the most beautiful Moody Blues songs are here--Procession, The Story in Your Eyes, and One More Time to Live. Whether it succeeds or not in its greater aspirations--such as the attempt to encapsulate the entire history of mankind in one 50-minute album--this is still a great collection of many of the Moody Blues' greatest songs.
B00006RINF|5.0|I listened to some early Lacuna Coil samples, and I didn't like them at first. But that was early Lacuna Coil (which I've grown to like), back in their doom metal days. I bought this on impulse, and I love it. The instrumentals (double guitars!) are very well-executed and orchestrated for a consistent yet powerful sound, while both vocalists only add to the maelstrom. For someone who has never heard of these freaky Italians, the best way I can describe them would be to say they've got a style of their own. Don't listen to the folks that say they sound like The Gathering or Evanescence or whoever. <br />As great as it is, the album does suffer from a severe lyrical shortfall. Now, when I listen to metal, I couldn't care less about the lyrics (I'm a devout Christian who listens to black metal, if that says anything), but for people who are more critical of lyrics, don't expect anything brilliant. The songs basically talk about how empty life is, hence the band's name, which means \\"empty spiral.\\" The lyrics are bland and repetitive, and sometimes make no sense at all, which indicates a step backwards from earlier albums. But if you don't mind that, you're in for the ride of your life with this. Don't let the cover art fool you!<br />...
0060955775|5.0|veronika was a beautiful young woman with every thing going her way she could have any man she wanted...and infact she was having them too..she was all that a person could think in her age ...so why did she want to die? well because she had every thing. she decides that she has done every thing in life that makes it worth living for....and from now on each day of her life will just be a repetition of the earlier experiences. so she takes an over dose and wait for death to take her. but that would not make very good reading, not to mention it would only last one chapter...so she doesnt die..and this is precisely where the story begins. She is saved and she goes to a mental hospital where she is told she has but three weeks left to live. so this book looks at her last moments in this world, and it looks at the different ideals behind being mad and what people think. paul coelho uses not only Vernika's story but tells you the stories of other patients putting plenty of plot into it. it certainly changed my opinion of mad people. this is a definet read it has changed my life and made me think in a better way about life. Madness it seems is really worth it. what are you waiting for ...dont be a madman..go buy it now!

B00006690G|5.0|i think it is sweet that he wrote a song for (Hailie) his daughter
B000005S0E|5.0|the first song by the cure i became aware of, was 'caterpillar'.  i was a teenager and saw it on an australian video show when it was released.  i was smitten instantly, &amp; later bought the album 'the top', my first cure album.  it remains my favourite of the cure albums, and it still provides the same sense of doom, passion, love, curiosity, weirdness, and most of all humour, that it always has.  it was the first cure album to pull together all the cure's stylistic ideas that had previously been mostly on separate albums.  this was fairly radical at the time, with the metallic 'shake dog shake'; folk pop 'caterpillar'; gothgloom 'the top' &amp; 'the wailing wall; the naive and euphoric 'dressing up'; the disturbed and punky 'give me it'; the loony 'bananafishbones' &amp; 'birdmad girl'; and the paranoid 'piggy in the mirror' (one of my personal favourites).  in fact it is difficult to categorize and pinpoint this album at all, as it seems to succeed in finding the gaps between musical genres, emotions and themes, with a twisted humour so deadpan it might be madness.  the confidence of the next few albums would have been impossible without 'the top' - definately their most experimental, risky and groundbreaking album.  absolutely nuts.<BR>  <BR>&quot;oh i could be a polar bear - but it's impossible.&quot;
B000099T2L|5.0|Finally the Long Awaited Solo Album of Destinys Special Child is Here; and it is well worth the wait that fans have had to undergo for the past year.<br />Dangerously in Love shows a more mature Beyonce as she breaks away from the Pop/R&amp;B Hybrid that has defined Destiny's Child's sound over the past years. The singer experiments with soulful ballads and catchy tunes that demonstrate her rich vocals and sultry sounds. The duet with Luther Vandross proves to the skeptic that indeed Beyonce has what it takes to be called a &quot;Diva&quot; of music; in the years to come we can only expect her to grow more and perfect her craft.<br />The Album actually includes 17 tracks (03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Work it Out and Daddy being the extra and bonous tracks) there is also a Special Limited Edition Album which has another track entitled &quot;I Can't Take No More&quot;. The Album sees her pairing with rumoured boyfriend Jay-Z three times, as well as a quashi duet with Jamaican Reggae Star Sean Paul on the track Baby Boy; the singer even sings in the Jamaican Dialect called Patois.<br />It is obvious that alot of work went into the album to make Beyonce's sound more mature and R&amp;B classical, however, this is too obvious on a few tracks where she sounds as if she just does it to show off. Thats the one fault I found with the album.<br />The standout tracks are:<BR>1. Dangerously in Love<BR>2. Crazy in Love<BR>3. The Closer I get to you<BR>4. Work it Out<BR>5. 03 Bonnie and Clyde.<br />The Album is new so some songs will need to creep up on the listener.<br />Beyonce proves along with Christina Aguilera, Pink, Alicia Keys, etc. That they can be Feminine, Beautiful and talented at the same time. Hats Off ladies.<br />Pave the way into the New Age of Music!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce did what alot of group members are trying to do, branching out to work on solo projects. The only difference is she did it successfully. This is an Amazing CD, each song is different from the next. From R&B Ballads to Hip Hop Club Songs, it's incredible<br />1.Crazy In Love-Great Choice for first single, this is a song that grows on you, the more you listen to it, the more you like it<br />2.Naughty Girl-This will no doubt be a single of the album, this is such an amazing song, this is definantly radio and club friendly<br />3.Baby Boy-This song is w/ Sean Paul, and it's got an hip-hop feel w/a little bit slower vibe, and the background is kind of arabic. Great Song<br />4.Hip Hop Star-Incredible. This song is like a female version of nelly, this could definanlty be a single.<br />5.Be with you-This is a slower song, with a beat in the main chorus which you will definantly recognize because the beat was on another famous song a few years back.<br />6.Me, Myself And I-Feel Good Song,Great is all I can say<br />7.Yes-This is an amazing song, this is something you could picture destinys child doing. Its a little bit slower, but the lyrics are great.<br />8.Signs-This song is about different star signs, the lyrics are catchy how she put them together.<br />9.Speechless- This is a true R&B Ballad<br />10.That's How You Like It-This is a great song w/ Jay-Z, it has an upbeat feel to it, it's a fun song with a childlike quality to it.<br />11.The Closer I Get To You-This is a beautiful duet, not much more can be said for this song that that.<br />12.Dangerously In Love 2-This is exact same lyrics as Dangerously In Love Part One, The only difference is a little bit of change in beat, and this type it's just Beyonce. Better than the first.<br />13.Beyonce Interlude-Short, Simple Interlude that is Nice<br />14.Gift From Virgo-This is a really great song, it's the last known one on the album and it's a slow song with a beat that picks up every now and then<br />BONUS-Daddy-This is a bonus track, written about, ofcourse her Dad, it's a really beautiful song, and the lyrics are moving<br />All in All, *****5 Stars, I'd give it 10 if I Could, And on a Personal note, out of all the solo cd's from the girls, this one would definantly have to be my favorite. Oh, and it's Enhanced some.
B000092ZYX|5.0|By far a great album, but to be expected from such an original and fantastic band as Radiohead.  You keep this one on repeat the whole way through;  the songs blend into one another so that you don't even realize when one's ended and the next has begun.  Masterful techno sounds mix with the easy piano notes, making a wonderfully ecclectic sound to keep each hearing just as enthralling as the first time.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is incredible, and a classic, the first, and definately the best G&R ever put out, if you don't have it get it!
0316666343|2.0|The Lovely Bones did not hold my interest.  I found it a struggle to finish this book.  It was difficult to identify with the protagonist (heroine?), Susie, and, for that matter, with any of the other characters.  <br />Yes, this is a terrible thing that happened to her, being murdered by a serial rapist/murderer.  This sorry fellow, the murderer, was apparently abused by his own mother: Does that explain the etiology of his behavior?  Well, in any case, he gets his due in the end: slain by a deadly icicle (I wouldn't kid about this).<br />But meanwhile, because the law can't catch the perpetrator, maybe, Susie is more or less in limbo, still watching her family, classmates, and the perpetrator, from somewhere above.  What she sees is, well, not that exciting.  Probably, this book would appeal more to sensitive people, in that it resembles poetry somewhat, a kind of dancing around to get the point across.<br />As for the metaphysics, the living on after death, returning to earth as a spirit and actually inhabiting another person's body, briefly, this should appeal to those who believe in an afterlife.  Yet, it's not exactly a Christian metaphysic, in this book.  The metaphysic seems to fall rather between the cracks of organized religions, and maybe could be described more as a \\"New Age\\" metaphysic.<br />It seems right, that a person who is murdered whose murderer is still running around loose should watch from above until he himself dies, by one means or another.  But is this really God's way?  Or the way of the Universe, whatever Force is out there behind it all?  It seems unlikely, because of all the senseless murders and other deaths that seem to go apparently unrequited.<br />Maybe the key word here is \\"apparently.\\"  Maybe, as in the Christian metaphysic, it all comes out in the wash, at the Second Coming.  But if not, well, I did finish the book: That's something, isn't it?      <br />Diximus.
B00007JRI6|5.0|Wad up B? Go 'head and do yo thing, I really loved how in depth you are with your music, and I just wanted to congradulate you on what you've worked so hard for. Stay cute and (share some of that booty gurl, you know some of us are lacking in that area.)lol. <BR>          B.C. Rockford, Illinois
B00005JLEU|5.0|the environments in the movie are great and the movie tells a great love story.  Though it is an animation, adults will enjoy the love story because it is about true love and not some silly romantic comedy type of love story.<br />The story is great and I laughed several times and gaped in awe other times.  I missed the first 20 or so minutes of the movie but after the movie was finished, I understood what happened in the beginning.  Is that a spoiler?  I must stop now.
B00009XITQ|5.0|The DVD has not yet come out yet, but this movie is the best.  The soundtrack is awesome and I also give that 5 stars.  I saw this movie about two months ago and I can't wait to buy the DVD.  This movie is really sweet and here's why.  Daphnie never had a father as he became royalty over in London.  So when she is 17, she goes over there to meet him.  He takes her in and she is being herself.  Soon after, he becomes embarassed and she then has to dress like all the other girls (which are very ugly clothes).  The ending is a happy one and pretty perdictable.  Go out and at least rent this one, because it's a keeper!

B00005JKLZ|3.0|When I first saw this movie I was totally disappointed. Being a George Pal 1960s classic fan I just could not relate to this movie and I thought that there were too many obscure and not believable events and contradictions in the new 2002 film. I recently bought the dvd of this movie and watched it carefully, listening to the dialogue and also to the commentaries. I understand the movie better now and it does make more sense, however it still suffers from major contradictions and holes. I really want to like this movie but I am stretching my judgement already. The deleted scene would have helped somewhat but it was cut out. Overall: Poor to Fair (Good if you have a six pack before watching this). The DVD picture and sound quality are very good.
B000099T2L|5.0|I heard Beyonce's album a week or so before it came out. I don't know how any could think that Beyonce's album is not a masterpiece. I wasn't disappointed in the least bit, it's a wonderful album. It's great!<br />But there are some things I should warn you about. Beyonce's album is probably not what you're expecting. Most people are expecting something shallow with hot beats and it's not that at all.<br />It's actually a deep, thought-provoking album that will take a lot of listening to. Even huge Beyonce fans who have heard the album say that they do not like it, but I'll be the first to say that the album is a treat. The lyrics and the productions are masterpieces. They are masterfully put together and immaculately crafted. Beyonce flexes her artistic muscle with pride on this album.<br />The issues that she talks about on the LP are different as well. She talks about experiences of ending relationships because her man thinks she's \\"taking it too slow\\" (on \\"Yes\\"), she talks about being somewhat of the badgirl on \\"Naughty Girl,\\" and she stays crazy in love on tracks such as \\"Baby Boy\\" (featuring Sean Paul), \\"That's How I Like It,\\" and \\"Be With You.\\"<br />Beyonce's album isn't full of crap. She also keeps it sexy on tracks like \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Signs,\\" a tribute to all the zodiac signs and how many different ways she's in love with each of them. Beyonce does get down and dirty on \\"Hip Hop Star\\" (featuring Big Boi & Sleepy Brown), one of the few extreme beats that she has on the album.<br />Crazy In Love (featuring Jay-Z) - 5/5<BR>Naughty Girl - 4/5<BR>Baby Boy (featuring Sean Paul) - 5/5<BR>Hip Hop Star (featuring Big Boi & Sleepy Brown) - 4/5<BR>Be With You - 5/5<BR>Me, Myself & I - 5/5<BR>Yes - 4/5<BR>Signs (featuring Missy Elliott) - 5/5 (Dope!)<BR>Speechless - 4/5 (Beautiful piece.)<BR>That's How You Like It (featuring Jay-Z) - 4/5<BR>The Closer I Get To You (duet with Luther Vandross) - 4/5<BR>Dangerously In Love 2 - 5/5<BR>Beyonce Interlude - 5/5 (Very sexy!)<BR>Gift From Virgo - 5/5 (I love this!)<BR>*BONUS TRACK* Daddy - 4/5<br />Well, that's my review of Beyonce's album. But you make the decision. All I have to say is, don't sleep on it.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This album set the stage for a revolution in Jazz music. One that was very much needed in the late 60's. The invention of this new musical form was indeed a challenge to traditional jazz artists and listeners alike. This album also signalled Miles' movement away from bebop and into a whole new musical journey. As noted in some of the reviews on Amazon.com with this recording, some people just didn't like the change in Miles. Those who want to listen to Miles should start with his early recordings and then hear him evolve as some may be disappointed with this. I found it was a change for the better.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  In the rock genre, I don't see how you could top it.  It has everything you could ask of a true masterpiece - epic classics, haunting ballads, bluesy pyrotechnics, successful experiments.  If I had to go to the proverbial desert island, this would be the album I would take.  It is one of the main reasons I started playing guitar.  Perhaps no other band in the history of rock is able to sustain such an incredibly wide, versatile gradient of sound - from the heavy, infectious blues of the opening tracks, Custard Pie and The Rover (a very underrated tune, almost like brilliant garage band rock) to the acoustic melancholy of Bron-Yr-Aur to the wistful beauty of Ten Years Gone.  The first side of what was originally released as a double album is quite simply perfect.  Following the first 2 tunes is In My Time of Dying, an incomparable blues prayer workout with probably the most mind-blowing electric slide guitar work you will ever hear, accompanied by Plant's plaintive, spiritual wails pleading to be taken to the promised land when he's all through.  Bonham's drumming is, as always, thunderous and apocalyptic, and really drives this one along.  Houses of the Holy (misplaced by name, since this was the title of the last album released) is another catchy, almost playful straight-ahead rocker, while Trampled Underfoot is one of the true triumphs in the Zep catalog, and as close to hard-core funk as you will ever find the band.  Jonesy's staccato synth playing turns this burning, sex-laced pile-driver into a rock song that is almost danceable; you just can't help but move around to it.  The album's magnum opus is Kashmir, a 7+ minute song influenced very heavily by Indian and Eastern music, and which is quite simply breathtaking in its scope.  The sonic backdrop is expansive, the lyrics are vintage Plant (mystical and scenic), and the guitar / synth (pseudo-strings) interplay is spellbinding.  This is one of those tunes which really takes you away, transports you.  It stands as one of the high points in all of rock.  Bron-Yr_Aur is the acoustic highlight on the album, and harkens back to Page's more folky days from Zep III.  The second side is more experimental, and feels more like a hodge-podge of odds and ends in some places, but with Zeppelin, even that can turn into another classic album side.  In the Light continues with the dark, mystical feeling evoked in Kashmir, with a haunting, almost Pink Floydian keyboard part leading the way in the intro.  Great guitar part, great vocal performance.  Ten Years Gone is another high point, and really helps to establish Zeppelin in the rock pantheon as far as versatility and sheer brilliance.  The guitar parts are aching and evocative, progressing from lurking and foreboding to almost anthemic in the chorus.  I love the lyrics in particular on this one, describing a la Stairway to Heaven the choices we all make in life and how fleeting is the passage of time.  The album jolts and bounces through Night Flight, a lively loose tune in which the band really sounds like they're enjoying themselves at the height of their success, and barrels into The Wonton Song, another very underrated, powerful rocker.  Some of the guitar work in the breaks on this one is mystifying - Page is a peerlessly creative guitarist.  Down By the Seaside is a pretty little tune, much more laid back and relaxed than most of them Zep did.  Towards the end of the set, Black Country Woman is a raunchy, bluesy (yet acoustic) stomp that (I think) they recorded outside, and Boogie With Stu (with Ian Stewart from Stones fame) is a fine piano driven tune which once again can get you up and dancing.  Despite all their innovation and success, give Zeppelin credit for staying true to their roots - blues, rockabilly, you hear all of them on this one.  The album closes out with Sick Again, another powerful (dare I say almost grungey before grunge?) scorcher which is a fitting end to a powerful album.  In short, Physical Graffitti has no holes or lapses, no throwaway songs, and IMHO is the best rock album ever made, amidst a catalog of inspired, brilliant Zeppelin albums.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica are definetly the best heavy metal band ever.I own every album,but this has to be my favorite one.So what if it isn't thrash,it is awesome.Cliff is a better bassist than Jason,but his playing is awesome here.Here is my song review:<br />1.Enter Sandman-10/10-A classic.Most people think this is the best song here,but I prefer Sad But True.The video is WAY overplayed,but is their best video.Awesome solo.<BR>2.Sad But True-10/10-The best Metallica song of all time.Unfortuneately,Kid Rock butchered this into \\"American Bad Ass\\".The lyrics are very meaningful.<BR>3.Holier Than Thou-10/10-The heaviest song here.A great song to listen to when you are angry.The strongest solo on the album.<BR>4.The Unforgiven-10/10-An awesome song.Metallica's best ballad.Great acoustic intro,and a great Eric Clapton style solo.Lyrics don't make sense,though.<BR>5.Wherever I May Roam-10/10-An awesome  song about a vagabond.Features a long,but awesome solo.<BR>6.Don't Tread On Me-9/10-Cool song.Lyrics are VERY dumb.Sounds like a blues song.James' vocals are hard to understand in the chorus.<BR>7.Through The Never-9/10-Great song.I have no idea what the lyrics mean.Mind-blowing drums in the chorus.Great solo.<BR>8.Nothing Else Matters-10/10-An awesome song.This was Metallica's first love song.It also was the first song to feature strings.<BR>9.Of Wolf And Man-10/10An awesome song.Jason lets out some cool screams in the chorus.The S& M version is awful.Same with Sad But True.<BR>10.The God That Failed-8/10-A pretty good song in memory of James'mother.Not as slow as Unforgiven or Nothing Else Matters,but slower than the rest.<BR>11.My Friend Of Misery-8/10-My least favorit song here.Not bad though.<BR>12.The Struggle Within-9/10-Great song.Just what a metallica album closer should sond like.<BR>This is the best metal album ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKN9|5.0|There's too much detail to get into for this movie. The plot is simple enough, but the story is drawn out so meticulously and shown so beautifully, it needs to be seen to be fully appreciated. The acting is amazing. The sets are just incredible. How great is it to see a movie that looks so amazing, yet is not completely done up on CGI!<br />Scorcese's best work in years - If not ever!
B000002N2Z|5.0|I have found that with most bands their debut cd is their best.  The reasons for this are probably because they have less production, are less worried about trying to break into the mainstream and they've had their entire lives up to that point to write the music.  Now technically I cannot say that Adrenaline is Deftones best album since I do not own Around the Fur (the one that most seem to call their best), but I do own White Pony.  Now don't get me wrong, White Pony is an incredible album, but personally I enjoy this one more.<BR>This is an incredibly heavy album, although that is not always something desired, since it is done much too much these days.  But Deftones manage to do it much better than any other band I have heard.  With Chino Moreno's emotional and abstract lyrics, Abe Cunningham's precise beats and the deadly and incredibly heavy combination of Stephen Carpenter's guitar and Chi Cheng's bass.<BR>If you feel the need to buy a heavy metal album I strongly suggest that you get Adrenaline by Deftones.<br />Other great heavy metal albums: Master of Puppets-Metallica, Korn-Korn, Darkside of the Spoon-Ministry, White Pony-Deftones

B000000WCX|4.0|By C.S.<BR>  <BR> David Bowie has been a clear cut case and point of an artist who is in the game for the long haul- to make good music and not compromise personal creativity for commercial gain.<BR> On \\"Earthling\\" he has put forth a collection that is a musical bag of treats.<BR>Bowie is backed by a gorgeous group of musicians, headed by co- producer Reeves Gabriel on synths and guitars, Mike Garson on piano, Zach Alford on live drumsand loops, and Gail Ann Dorsey on bass.<BR> <BR>\\"Little Wonder\\" is case and point of the ensemble working in striking unison with it's funky, warm, bass- led breakdown and guitar driven quick- tempo version of the same at the latter stages of the track. The approach of using both programmed and live drums in the same arrangement works well on quyite a few numbers here, and Bowie's eccentricity also surfaces on the quirky \\"Looking For Satellites\\",where technology beautifully co- exists with crisp guitars, and the politically charged \\"Seven Years In Tibet\\", with it's Nine Inch Nails like intro,spooky keyboards that create the feeling the listener is entrapped in a funky haunted house, and the accompanying dark vocals by Bowie,\\"are you okay you've been shot in the head. Im holding your brains the old lady said\\"<BR>  <BR>The volume and energy level rise a couple more decibels on \\"Dead Man Walking\\",a track mired in a layered wall of bassy,spacey synths,intense tempo breaks, and world- class bass playing from Dorsey, and \\"The Last Thing You Should Do\\", where a repeat menu  punchy bass-lines and heavy guitars layered beautifully against futuristic synths,exploit the precision with which Bowie and his running mates are able to incorporate all of the weapons effectively. <BR> With the exception of \\"the single \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\" and \\"Law\\"(Earthling On Fire) which are a over- produced failures by the slightest of margins, \\"Earthling\\" is a near picture perfect portrait of songs<BR> If nothing else,the way this record was mixed where each instrument pushes it's way to the forefront without overwhelming the other, makes a very attractive listening experience, with strong material to match. <BR>  An album of supreme quality, \\"Earthling\\" gets a four star rating.<br /> C.S.<BR> 6-26-03
0553213105|1.0|And I was very disappointed with 'Pride and Prejudice', which I read by choice. It did not offer anything I would expect from a good book: surprise, pleasure (intellectual as well as emotional), humor (the character of Mr. Bennet being an exception), new ideas or meaningful information. After finishing the book I ran to a bookstore and traded it for a second-hand copy of 'A House for Mr. Biswas'. Maybe this time...
B000099T2L|3.0|I like the cd. The cd is ok.The songs are all alright. Especially the ones with Jay-Z in them.I love him so much and think his voice is just so.....I don't know.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A was the first time I had ever heard anything by Radiohead, and I must say I find it amazing. I had heard that Radiohead was a kind of alt/prog rock band, so I went into Kid A expecting some radio-worthy, borderline pop tracks. I couldn't have been more wrong. What I got was a twisted realm of nightmares that you can't wake up from and a wasteland of the mind. There is some seriously dark ambient music on this album. Parts of it have been compared to The Aphex Twin, and I think that's a fair comparison. This album still gives me chills, especially Everything In Its Right Place and the title track. The National Anthem is one of the best tracks on the album, going from dissonant horns and saxophones to a sheer wall of noise. Talk about exhilirating. Fans of The Aphex Twin and harsh/dark ambient will surely find a small place of solace in Kid A, a place to call home. And unlike The Aphex Twin, who mixes in the occasional light, almost happy piece such as Analogue Bubblebath I, Kid A is relentless in its pessimism. The feeling even stretches into the bizzare (but incredibly awesome) artwork that coems with the album. I haven't listened to any other Radiohead music, but I think this album is great. My only gripe was the track most people seem to like, Optimistic. I didn't think it fit in very well, though it's not a bad song, so to speak. All in all, if you want to hear something completely different from almost anything you've ever heard, and you have an open mind, go for it. Otherwise, maybe settle for something a little more mainstream.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I am an avid Joy Division fan and yes, there are some heavy Joy Division influences to be found in Interpol's music. That is absolutely a complement. I am not saying Interpol sounds just like Joy Division, but there are some strong similarities in more than one song (listen to Leif Erikson closely). The overall emotional appeal of each is completley different however, but this album from Interpol should really be judged on its own merit. It is a terrific album and they are a terrific band.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I have been in a few musicals and this is one that I really hope to do someday. GET THIS CD. The funniest song ever is Class (it should have been in the movie.) Everytime I listen to it I laugh so hard. They sound interestingly good together. The rap with Macy should be burned right off of the CD. Both the CD and the DVD are going to be huge so get the Special Limited Edition of both the CD and DVD if you can.
0451169514|5.0|This is a very good book, the best Stephen King novel I've read. Even though it's a horror book it contains so much more than only horror. It's a book about friendship, growing up, fellowship and overcoming your fears. I think that's what makes the book so great. &quot;It&quot; could have been just another horror book but various things make it outstanding. I would almost call &quot;It&quot; a beatiful book because it really touches you; The characters, their friendship and their fight together. Unlike many other horror books, this one really focus on it's characters and their development. It's really just one thing that bothers me when it comes to this book and it's something that happens in the end of the book, involving Beverly and the other guys. If you've read it, you know what I'm talking about. That part was totally unnecessary and in my opinion, should never have been in the book. Except for that, the book is extremely well-written and definately worth reading.
B000099T2L|3.0|I do recommend buying this CD, but a lot of the songs, like more than half, or those slow,love,melody songs that's kinda boring.  There are like 5 that are the hip hop type like \\"Crazy In Love\\", but the rest are just kinda boring.  It's still a good CD if you're into those songs. lol.  I was just expecting more songs that you can dance to. Plus \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" is NOTHING different than it's first song.  It's the exact same song. I think there may be one extra beat to it, but you can't tell.  I think it was just a cheap excuse just to put it on the album to get more recognition.  Anyway, get this album!
6305280762|5.0|I found &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; to be an extremely entertaining movie.  I really liked it.  This film has an incredible cast, and a suspenseful, occasionally terrifying story.  Many people get burned and killed in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, so it's not for kids.  It's also quite long, so prepare yourself for that.  The cinematography is great, and the picture quality on this DVD is razor sharp.  Unfortunately, the only extras are a trailer and brief biographical information on the main stars.  No making-of documentaries or commentary during the movie.
B000099T2L|4.0|You should definitely pick up this album.  Recenlty, solo artists who have left their groups to be solo, their albums are kina hurtin' without the group.  But not this one.  Beyonce really knows how to work her self!
B00006CXSS|5.0|You have to see this series.  war truly brings out the best and the worst in mankind.
0915811774|5.0|This is a book that shows us how to find the answers within oneself.  Why do we feel stressed?  How do we alleviate it?  How can we feel more joy, instead of feeling neutral or numb?  Why do certain people treat us the way we do and how can we deal with it?  And most important, how can we bring more love in to our lives and in to our relationships.  All these topics are explored in Soul Love.  The ones who have the most abundance in their lives are the ones who love themself in a deep, intimate way and this book uses guided meditations to bring that out of the reader.  This book is not for everyone.  If you don't believe that your soul exists, or don't have the desire to open up to something that could elevate your level of human understanding and if you don't believe in God, angels or spirits this book is not for you.  The non-secular people should stick to 'Dr. Phil'or your basic psychological self help books.  But for those who do believe, your life will change from the moment you begin reading.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I had this.  I threw it away.  That's how bad it is.  It's entertaining, well choreographed, but it's just plain awful.  Soldiers cluster up, people are running everywhere screaming and firing wildly, there was clearly almost no consultation from a military historian or combat specialist.....<br />or one of any worth.<br />the movie is garbage!  terrible.  it's a shame to waste the audience's time with a poker faced so-called &quot;actor&quot; such as nick coppola and not try to actually develop a story around the native american radio-men OR the actual events in Saipan!!<br /> John Woo's DP makes a beautiful movie, some battle scenes are huge and awesome in their scope, but there is no redeeming content, no reason to watch the movie.  it's a mindless running-screaming-shooting movie, with little historical basis.<br />Do NOT give MGM anything for this poor effort!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is a great comeback for Radiohead. Not that Kid A and Amnesiac were not great, but I think most fans have been waiting for more of the guitars and style that made OK Computer great. Hail to the Thief combines the experimentation of Kid A &amp; Amnesiac with the listenability and structure of The Bends and OK Computer. I don't believe this is a love-it-at-first-listen album. It took me 5 listens before I &quot;got it&quot;. That is how the best albums usually are. Every style of Radiohead (to this point!) is represented here. Every track is good in it's own way- there are no garbage songs. It's hard to pick highlights, but &quot;2+2=5&quot;, &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Where I end and you Begin&quot;, and &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; are the very best. Enjoy, and see them live if you can!
B00005JKWJ|3.0|Nice special effects, utterly forgettable everything else.  It's important to point out, though, although the CG is &quot;nice&quot;.. that dosen't make it &quot;over-used&quot;.. ahem.
0312263120|3.0|I read this book after reading Da Vinci Code (which is one of the most entertaining book I have read in recent years), and I must say that Digital Fortress doesn't come close.  Not by a mile. Understandably, this is one of Brown's earlier works.  But the bottom line is this book lacks the complexities and element of surprise (and profounding plot) found in Da Vinci Code.
B000069I1H|1.0|Guys, know when to quit.  It makes money, but it's shameful.  It's also not that funny!  This is the kind of numbingly stupid movie that deniro seems to like to make these days.  Unfortunate, because i know he can do better.  God-awful.
B000063DI9|5.0|Out of all the Iron Maiden albums I own, its safe to say that this is my absolute favorite.  At the time of the album's release, the band reached the height of the career, and then went downhill after Adrian Smith left.  Sythesizers are used in sections, and add an atmospheric quality to the album.  7th Son of a 7th Son is one of those albums where every song is top quality.  It starts with \\"Moonchild,\\" a energetic song, and ends with \\"Only the Good Die Young,\\" another powerful track.  Inbetween are Maiden's finest songs.  If I had to pick one overall \\"best\\" song, it would have to be \\"The Clairvoyant.\\"  The bass intro is outstanding, and the rest of the song has a happy, almost upbeat melody to it.<br />If you want the absolute best Iron Maiden album, this would be the one.  Although most will say that The Number of the Beast was their greatest, I believe that 7th Son of a 7th Son is nearly flawless.
B00009V7T2|5.0|good lord...this is great music-period.  every song evolves nicely and each listen builds upon the last.  at the drive in? no.  much much better.  Sparta who? who cares, we have the mars volta.
0446677450|2.0|A lot of rah-rah, not a lot of substance.<br />I give it 2 stars only because I think it may have some motivational value.  In terms of practical advice its value is minimal.<br />You should also be aware that there is a lot of skepticism about this author and the claims he makes.  Do some investigation and you'll likely be unsettled.
B000001DV2|3.0|Five years after their blockuster release, HYSTERIA, Def Leppard released ADRENALIZE which contains little resemblance. It's obvious that Def Leppard is getting more pop with each release. ADRENALIZE, releasesd 11 years ago, (was it really that long ago?), is no doubt a lighter record then the previous HYSTERIA, or PYROMANIA before that. While the songs lack the bite of the earlier releases, they still are worth a listen. The album is dedicated to their late guitar player, Steve Clark, who passed away from alcohol poisoning in January of 1991. Ironically, Clark wrote or co-wrote half of the tracks here.     The opening track is really fun. \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" is an anthem for the whole album itself. \\"Heaven Is\\" is a fast-paced ballad written by Clark. \\"Make Love Like a Man\\" is another catchy track that is highly underrated. It's my favorite track on the album. \\"Tonight\\" is a nice ballad, and \\"White Lightening\\" is a sorrowful, errie number that is by far the longest track on the album. The later took me awhile to get used to, but it as grown on me. \\"Stand Up(Kick Love Into Motion) is low-key rocker, and \\"Personal Property\\" is a fast track that picks things up. \\"Tear It Down\\" is probably the heaviest track on the album, if that really amounts to much. I believe that one, and a few more of these tracks were originally B-sides from the HYSTERIA album. So, this album is somewhat of a rehashing of leftover tracks, and would pave the way for the RETRO-ACTIVE record the following year. Overall, ADRENALIZE is a fun album, and will please a hard rock fan.
0440236738|5.0|The plot twists like a tornado ... all the way to the final page.  Just when you think you've figured it out, bam!!! you have to figure it all out again.  I can guarantee you won't know good from evil until the absolute emotional end.  I have read them all:  Grisham, Baldacci, Leonard, etc. and this is the first time I finish a book and run to my computer to write a review.  Will Klein will drive you a bit crazy but the story more than makes up for it with the heroics of the most unexpected characters in this wonderful tale.
0440236738|5.0|I only guessed correctly once through the entire book.  I don't know how many times towards the end of the book I thought that everything had been explained and I was wrong almost every single time up until the very last page.  This is true SUSPENSE!
B00006F2TV|4.0|I never saw this movie in the theatre, and I never rented it until usterday. Truth be told, I thought it would be stupid, nothing but a bunch of hype. But I did rent, and I sat down and watched it, and when it was over, I said, \\"Wow! That was pretty cool!\\" The special effects were cool, and it was well directed. The acting was pretty good, and they didn't kill the plot from the comic books.<br />The story, which probably everyone know, is a high schooler who is about to graduate, get bit by a geneticly engineered \\"super spider\\". The super spider's powers are transferred into Peter Parker. So, over night, he turns from a weak geek, into a strong man. He doesn't need his glasses anymore, either. Bit by bit he descovers his powers, climbing on walls, jumping really far, extra strong, shooting webs, and sensing danger. So he creates a ... costume, and goes wrestling for three minutes for 3000 dollars. But the guy only gives him a hundred because he pinned him in two, not three. Then a robber comes and steals the money and Peter lets him go. Then later, his Uncle Ben is shot by the same robber, so he devotes himself to fighting crime, and also he got a cool costume.<br />Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a scientist takes a human body enhancer that is suposed to increase strength by 800%. But the enhancer isn't ready, and he suffers from the side effects, anger, aggression, and insanity. So he has kind of a split personality, one good, one bad. So he steals a high tech glider and creates a costume and becomes the Green Goblin. At the end Spider-Man and the Green Goblin have a show down, which is pretty cool.<br />So all in all, it is a pretty cool action movie, with cool special effects, and they didn't ruin this movie, like they did with Daredevil, which was really stupid. So as comic book movies go, this is at the top with X-Men. So if you haven't seen it, and you think it will be stupid, go give it a try, actually, it was pretty cool.
B000060P79|1.0|Awful. Terrible. Preppy. Not punk, not rock. Hey, these guys don't even deserve to be called pop. It's that bad. Every single person that says this is the \\"greatest band ever\\" has obviously never heard Nirvana, The Beatles or the Foo Fighters. Every single song sounds just like the one before it and is terrible. Do not buy this album! You are only fueling the mainstream pop monster! We must destroy it before it takes over! Do yourself, and music, a favor and buy Nevermind by Nirvana, any Beatles album, or any Foo Fighters album. But do not buy this trash. There is only one thing an album like this is good for. FIRE STARTER!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Clocks just may be one of the greatest songs ever written.  Simply put, this albums is just a phenomenal piece of work, essential to any music lover's collection.
0792151712|3.0|I, too, like a much earlier poster read the book A Night To Remember.  This was a truly touching book.  It broke down the entire tragedy.  I found it particularly sad that the band kept playing, trying to keep the people calm.  I think what did it was the ship being \\"unsinkable even by God.\\"  Don't test the Master!!  <br />I also saw a movie w/Clifton Webb from the 50s.  Far superior to Titanic.  I think Titanic's biggest problem was that the love story dominated the ENTIRE THREE HOURS!!  That is just too long.  My first time seeing it was at a sleepover and I fell asleep. I just didn't feel up to watching the second tape.  We all went to sleep and woke up the next morning and finished it.<br />I am not down for overly sappy stories.  Especially when it's fiction added to tragedy.  I don't think the actual tragedy was held high enough in this flick.  <br />My fellow reviewers have done a good job of getting the point across already.  If you want to see a real Titanic story, see teh Clifton Webb version.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005221L|5.0|Definitive.  Genre defining.  Awesome.  It is freakin' great
B00009V7T2|5.0|I can't believe the quality of this album. Please do yourself a favor and buy this album, don't download it.  It's astonishing. Comparisons abound, easiest to start with is obviously At the Drive In, the members can't shake their past and I don't know why they'd want to. On subsequent listens one hears Jeff Buckley, Led Zeppelin, early Santana, Pink Floyd, Failure, and even the Flaming Lips coming through as influences. The songs are intricate and structured but still catchy as hell. Worth every penny.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Words can not explain this album's concepts on why this is one of the greatest albums to hit shore since Radiohead's OK Computer. First off, I'd like to agree with magazines such as NME, SPIN, MAXIM, BLENDER, AP, etc etc. who gave DE-loused in the Comatorium what it deserves. I'm very upset with Rollingstone magazine who gave it just an average rating(3/5) which is the only review I've read and seen that gave this album what it doesn't deserve. This album can really be loved by anyone who love's music. This album surpasses any album thats came out this year (including Radiohead's Hail To The Thieves!!!) De-loused intertwines every beautiful aspect on life and every possilble horrorful tradgy any of us has been through. This album will not be repeated in anyone's lifetime. No album will come close to this one as being the soundtrack of our lives.
0671027344|5.0|This book is a very honest book about a boy named Charlie.  The whole book is his thoughts about the world around him.  It is as if a diary, but so much more.  <BR>  <BR>The one the thing the reader can get from this book is a relationship with Charlie.  The reader can relate to so many of the thoughts and actions that Charlie is faced with.  I believe this book is a great book for anyone who ever looks at someone and wonders \\"What are they thinking?\\"  This is what Charlie thinks.<BR>  <BR>This book is my favorite book.  I hope it becomes yours.
B00008DDRX|4.0|If you want a movie, this will disappoint. If you want a racing documentary, this will disappoint. But...if you will open your eyes and take a few deep breaths, you'll see something crossing reality and fiction with unusual success. I read that the studio suits wanted McQueen to flesh out the relationship angle more, kind of like that racing soap opera, Grand Prix of a few years earlier. Good for McQueen because he created a classic with his stubborn purity for the sport. Its good because its real--as real as a movie can get. At some point into the film's first viewing there's a little voice going, &quot;what the heck is this?&quot; The answer might be its a docufictionary or a fictiomentary. There's sort of a story, but its mostly about the racing. The people are just these fleshy things that drive the cars really fast. McQueen has two great moments-both while he's sitting around. The first one is waiting for the race to begin, and boy, do you get the feeling of butterflies in the stomach watching him wait. The second is when he's been pulled out of the race and then is called to go back in. You realize that he's like a dead body returning to the land of the living. Driving the car is life to him: full-bodied, technicolor life. Nothing else really matters. I remember hearing about Steve McQueen racing at LeMans about the time this film was made and how he was driving his Porsche with a broken foot. Unfortunately,if this movie were remade today, it would be spoiled with cg animation and other special effects (and curse his soul, Marky Mark!) The wrecks and spills are real, not Hollywood enhanced. So thanks, Steve, you really did something remarkable here.
B00006879E|4.0|this cd is awesome--definately one of my favorites.  and as good is as this cd is, their live performances are even better.  i caught them opening for john mayer last fall and just saw them with jason mraz and they were amazing!  i recommend that any fan of the album checks out their live show so they can see just how awesome maroon5 is!!

0440224764|5.0|In my opinion, this is the most entiticng Grisham novel I've read.  Non stop action that will keep you gripping the book until the last page.  Its one of those that keeps getting better chapter-by-chapter!! I've read the book three times!!<br />The depth of the characters, the intelligent written plot, and how the events unfold is absolutely stunning!  It makes you believe that anything is possible in this world.<br />I learned a great deal from this book, I enjoyed the Patrick Lanigan character so much that I actually took it a step further.  I designed and completed a full psychological profile of Patrick Lanigan.  In other words, through his behavior in the story, I analyzed his personality traits and characteristics;  the decisions he made throughout the story, his approach to problems was very unique.  After completing all that, I superimposed his character onto my professional life.  Whenever I encountered a difficult decision, I would look at Patrick's Psych Profile and I would say, if I was Patrick Lanigan what decision would I choose!  And I am very delighted with the choices I made.  In a way, The Partner gave me new insight on decision-making.<br />I highly recommend this book.<br />Enjoy it.

B00008CLOA|1.0|Wow....I am a fan of Wizard of Oz and he CLEARLY copied this as &quot;his&quot; soundtrack to the film...You can believe what you want but I really dis-like this cd!
B000002JSP|5.0|This is not the band in its physical prime.  Plant's voice is strained, and Page seems to have (permanently) lost something in his fleet fingers.  While Bonham is as good as ever, I get the sense that more tracks than normal are being overdubbed.  Page has a difficult time making sessions the way he used to, his presence isn't what it used to be.  Also, with the death in Plant's family and the move in England towards synth rock (which was to swallow bands like Queen whole, with Robert somewhat following suit in his solo career), synthesizers are put on display on this album in a way they never had been before.  So, there are problems with this record.  But this is no ordinary band. There is no rock band, ever, that matched the cohesion and individualized skill at each position, as this one.  The Doors, the Allmans, the Jimi Hendrix Experience ... there's a lot of great things I could say about them, obviously, but for the total performance from each person in this band, I think it was the tightest and most cohesive.  And they were strong enough to accommodate the forces moving against them.  For Plant's gravelly, weakened voices, there is strengthened insight and poetry.  He can still notes, but it sounds strained, and I find myself rooting for him,  One thread of Zep's songwriting always had JPJ coming up with principle ideas and Jimmy elaborating, e.g. Black Dog, No Quarter.  So, it's a winning strategy, and it works here.  For Page's loss of performing standards, he begins using a device called a B-Bender, which bends his B string and gives his performances a country-music flavor - which he'd always had, but now even more pronounced.  JPJ's synthesizer work is majestic.  So, the totality is something that in some way pales, and in other ways reigns supreme.  It's perhaps worth noting that over the years, I've come to value this more than its predecessor, Presence.  I had once had Presence as my favorite, for its tight guitar playing and bluesy lyrics.  It's stillgreat of course, but In Through The Out Door is a richer listening experience for me now.  In fact, ironically, there's nothing quite like it from them for feeling like the dumps, than this and .. their first album.
B00005JLKB|5.0|My husband has been a fan of this show since it's beginning.  Since I am not a fan of television, it took him awhile but he finally persuaded me to watch one episode with him a couple of months ago and I've been hooked ever since.  I have been anticipating the release of this DVD collection so that I can see what I have missed of this wonderful show.  When there is so much nonsense on television, it is refreshing to find a treasure like Smallville.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I was a big Madonna fan. I went to her concerts, I bought her CD's, and life was good. Then came this CD and the burning question, how could such a talented, insightful artist change her style to this awful sounding mess? Granted I should have seen it coming with her brilliant rendition of \\"American Pie\\" but yet I still believed that some good still existed in the universe. Her fans that loved her first albums are now casualties in her efforts to explore a new type of music that somehow seems to escape me. The bottom line here folks is if you like her older albums you are going to hate this one.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Well, I don't agree with the band politically, but, I have to say they are very good at making the best music. We all know we can disagree, but I don't let that in my way of liking maybe the best band since Pink Floyd. I know, I know, people have been comparing them for years. But, they are the real deal, and they produce and come out with the best records of the year. Even if they have an off album, they still come out with top notice music for that year. Now, they might hate Bush, and I voted for him, but I still listen to their music. They RULE! HAIL TO THE THEIF (I WISH THEY MENT GORE) but this album rocks.
B00005JLZN|2.0|The Life of David Gale revolves around hot-to-trot reporter Bitzy Bloom (why the screenwritter chose that name out of every other name in the world I will never know.) Bitzy (Kate Winslet) is to interview former college professer and well known death row abolitionist David Gale (Kevin Spacey). Ironically enough he is on death row for the rape and murder of one of his colleges/friends played by Laura Linney.<BR>Now, Bisty has three days to figure out if Davids story of being framed is true, and who the real culprit is.<BR>SOUNDS ORIGINAL AND INTRUIGING EH? NOT REALLY.<BR>This was a big suprise especially from director Alan Parker who has brought us classics like Angel Heart and Midnight Express.<BR>Where the movie failed is where 2/3 of thrillers these days do, comming up with an original plotline without the overuse of cliches and wannabe twists. This movie is full of both.<BR>While Kevin Spacey underplays the role and delivers a rock solid performance, Titanic chick Kate Winselt overacts to the point of no return. This makes the film even more unbeliveable. <BR>Laura Linney delivers a belivable and moving performance as the over-zelick death row abolitionist who will stop at nothing to prove a cause. Unfortunatly neither Spacey or Linney's performances can save a screenplay that uses the \\"out of service\\" cell phone cliche and is expected to be taken seriously. <BR>I understand what The Life of David Gale was trying to deliver in terms of its message on death row and capital punishment, but it did not need to be delivered to us in a package marked cliche.
0312983867|5.0|So, there I was, 45 mintues on the Elliptical machine at the gym, laughing so hard I almost fell off the machine! Not only did I laugh, but I couldn't put the book down.  When my usual 45 minutes were up I actually locked my legs into a stretch position so I could finish the next chapter.  <br />Okay, so this is the first Stephanie Plum story I have read and I had no idea what I was in store for me as I read.  I picked it up after reading \\"Monkeewrench\\" by P.J. Traci.  P.J.T.'s excellent novel was put into the same class as Evanovich - so of course I had to read one of her novel.  <br />If you are looking for a great read - light, thrilling, funny, and a real page turner - this IS a one to lose yourself in!  The characters are well developed, endearing, and down right hysterical.  I finished this book in a week (closer to a total of about six hours when you deduct time for work, sleeping, eating, showering, and all other daily activities during which one cannot read).  No need to have read the first seven in order to \\"get it\\" with this one.  Ms. Evanovich does an excellent job bringing the reader up to speed with the characters. While there are some inside jokes that will leave you craving more information, you do not need the first ones to get the gist. <br />I finished this book last night (06/23/03) and am aldready going through withdrawl until I can get my hands on the first 7 books. Get this book and enjoy it!  You won't regret it!
B00005JLRT|2.0|The film is okay. Certainly not the best STNG film, but it works.   The main thing I was disappointed in was the commentary on the DVD. Ultimate bore. The director is the only one providing commentary. It's quite apparent that he forgets that he's supposed to be providing any commentary. I frequently wondered if he stepped out for coffee. The film volume is not returned during his long pauses, either. Which leaves you with nothing to listen to. Also, he didn't need to whisper. He's not in a crowded theater. The secret to a good commentary track is to have more than one person providing the commentary. They can work off eachother and it becomes far more interesting. They totally missed the boat on this one.
B00005JLIU|5.0|JULIE ANDREWS IS JUST JUST JUST SMASHING in this odd, but charming little vehicle ~ elegantly restored in all it's campy Glory!<br />Great sound, great print!  [Odd that the Trailer is in full screen and rather dated ...]<br />However, the plot [!] has neither rhyme nor reason, and the concept just borders on being brilliant - giving 'birth' to the New musical decades later ..... but IT is utterly charming!<br />Mary Tyler Moore is the 'Virgin with a Purpose' , James Fox is the snappy 'Blonde-Boy-Toy' - perfectly matched with Miss Andrews [who is also in addition to being vocally perfect - is an excellent - straight-on comiedienne].  John Gavin as the hunky 'Boss' bordered by Beatrice Lillie as Mrs. Mears, complete with lethal chop-sticks!  Not forgetting Carol Channing who ignites the screen with her unique  and still robust flair for  entertainment [and the occasional gem!]<br />Gowns are superb by Jean Louis [Golden Age of Tinseltown here!!]<br />Not to be missed for sheer fun!<br />Bravo to the restoring team!
B0000062GE|5.0|I think that they have A lot more talent than some of the more popular bands out there like say linkin park and cold.Most fans of Marilyn Manson and Nine inch nails should like thid album.
B00005JLYU|2.0|The original \\"Charlie's Angels\\" was a goofy, tongue-in-cheek adventure that pitted critics in two camps: Those who could accept the sweet, fun trio of Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lio for who they were and what the movie made them to be, and those who saw an empty, stupid, pointless, constantly-winking-at-itself motion picture that existed for no better reason than to wink. <br />In round one, I went with the girls. <br />In round two, I'm leaning toward Charlie's Party Poopers. <br />Director McG's aptly titled creation, \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" needed less skit and more skirt. McG opted for the skit, realized in endless, one-after-another action setpieces that, in this already drenched-with-CGI climate, are not likely to stand out. There is nothing here to make one rethink the list of the summer's best stunts; nothing up McG's sleeve matches the active virtuosity of \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" or the opener in \\"X2\\" or the desert battle in \\"Hulk.\\" In fact, McG is still employing the stop-the-frame, bullet-time CGI that \\"The Matrix\\" has moved past. <br />There's is an arrogance at work in McG's approach, as well, that echoes, sadly, Michael Bay, a kind of impending pressure that if you don't find this mayhem abosolutely stunning, if you can't appreciate the various shades of red, blue and pink splashed across the screen, than you're a stiff. In the wake of the big, unexpected success of the first film, McG, along with producer Barrymore and everyone else that cheerfully poured their talents into this mess, clearly thought they had stumbled upon a kitschy, T&A version of James Bond or something. <br />How else to explain the opening sequence, the one you've seen in the trailers, that bears the mark of \\"this is one of our long line of trademark boffo opening sequences!\\" How else to explain the plot, an ominous piece of goods about two rings that reveal the identities of every person in the FBi Witness Protection program? And how else to explain the dead-in-the-water return of Demi Moore, who never had much fun in her movies in the first place (I do not recall the woman laughing...ever). The \\"fun\\" is the same \\"fun\\" from the first movie. The same boyfriends even come back. And Bosley, now played by Bernie Mac, is the same flat, straight man from the first picture.<br />I have to admit it takes a little effort to refuse bubble gum this sweet. But harmless as the movie may be, it is tedious, and very empty, and it seems to demand that no one acknowledge that it has flaws that can be fairly attributed to \\"fun\\" movies. As if to prove that emptiness can never be proverbial, McG keeps cutting and shooting and making his actors mug, all in an effort to prevent and mask over the dead air. But the dead air is still there, underneath, and it's a deadlier kind, because it hints at the sound of fury, signifying just what you think it does.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is A great cd if you are looking for some real rap/rock and not Limp Bizkit or Linkin park...then I suggest you invest in this cd.
0688163173|4.0|To sum it all up, this book started out strong, got boring, then finished with a bang! As I read it, I was finding myself getting annoyed with the constant flashbacks to the wife, but in the end it became clear. This was a good and quick read and would have gotten 3 stars if not for the strong finish.
0060987464|5.0|This is Mansons auto biography detailing some of the events that made him into the All american antichrist that christians love to hate.And well being A very well written book some of the stories are pretty distgusting.Probably not for kids under 13.It was kinda funny actually I did this book as a A book report for language arts and literature and when the class heard who I was reporting on they were shocked.Just goes to show how ignorant people can be.Anyway A great book well worth your money.
0385504209|5.0|I wasn't so sure about this book when I was contemplating getting it. I had never read any of Dan Brown's novels and I assumed it was going to be another 'run of the mill' mystery, but I was incredibly surprised! This was such an original and thought out and researched work that the factual elements alone kept me reading. But when you add in the actual story, I couldn't read it fast enough. If you are looking for something more in a novel than your typical Grisham, Patterson, Connelly, etc etc etc books, you've got to give this one a shot.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is when Marilyn went glam rock sort of David Bowie meets nine inch nails.And while some fans did not like this cd I think he made A wise decision with this one.the best tracks are great big white world,the dope show,mechanical animals and the lasttwo on the cd the last day on earth and coma white.
B000002J1F|3.0|Many people revere Fragile by Yes as the groups crowning achievement. I do admit Roundabout is a stunning piece of music. In addition, there are other notable moments such as the compelling Southside of the Sky,Wakeman's delightful Cans and Brahms the pretty acoustic number Mood For A Day, and the radio friendly Long Distane Runaround.<br />However, there are way too many filler pieces. We Have Heaven is just plain annoying with Jon Anderson's repetitive vocals. Five Per Cent For Nothing has potential but 35 seconds does not a song make. This song surely could have been ellabroated into a three minute jam while the slightly overlong Heart Of The Sunrise should have definitely been cut down. Chris Squire's The Fish is a bit on the drab side.<br />The good does slightly outweigh the bad. However, I definitely prefer The Yes Album to this inconsistent release.
B000001Y2U|4.0|Antichrist superstar the album that made him A household name is A great album the music the great lyrics everything is wonderfull my only complaint is the singing which isn't as good or clear as say it is on Holy Wood or Mechanical animals.Despite this Antichrist Superstar is A great Album that really penitrates all the problems with ones life.Best songs irresponsible hate anthem,the beautiful people(a song you have probably heard)touriquet,mister superstar,antichrist superstar,1996,the reflecting god and the man that you fear.
0140386335|5.0|I found The Neverending Story to be a magnificent read.  Firstly the reason I read the book was because I like many had watched the movie.  Reading it afterwards I was able to appreciate the movie but the book was so much better.  Things you had never thought of, Falkor was done wrong in the movie.  Basically... very basically the movie is much like the book... but only covers half of the story... if even that.<br />The best thing I found to be in the book is my attachment to the characters.  I normally don't get emotionally involved in a book... let alone attached to its characters.  I found myself glued to the book for hours at a time, yelling because things didn't go as they should have.  I couldn't put it down.<br />One thing I found interesting is Bastian started to irritate me around the middle of the book, which only served to make it that much more interesting.  One word: Grograman.  If there is one part that appeals to me its the part of the story that irritated me the most.  I won't spoil it for people whom haven't read the story, but that was the part that irritated me most of all yet I find it to be one of the best.<br />For those who watched the movie and wanted to know more about Bastian, Atreyu, Falkor, Gmork and the Childlike Empress this book does it.  Bastian actually has more of a purpose to reading The Neverending Story.  Instead of following the movies plot where Bastian wins and gets billions of wishes to make his life better, he gets something much better.<br />If you want a book you can't put down, with lots of imagination, easily remembered characters, and magnificent lines/meaning.  This is definitely a book to read.  There is so much hidden and apparent meaning in this book I'm sure everyone will find an aspect of it they like.  Instead of one hero you have a vast party of heros to choose from, each one a hero for different reasons.<br />If I would have read the book before watching the movie, I'm sure I would have been picking out flaws the entire time because it would be so fun.  There is enough difference between the two that if you seen the movie, you MUST read the book.  If you are just reading the book then you shouldn't be disappointed.laws the entire time because it would be so fun.  There is enough difference between the two that if you seen the movie, you MUST read the book.  If you are just reading the book then you shouldn't be disappointed.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is without A doubt Nine Inch Nails heaviest cd.While only having eight songs it is well worth the price.All the songs on Halo 5 are great!As A note to the reader if you do not enjoy one Nine Inch Nails cd there is still A good chance that you will enjoy A nother one as no two of Trents albums are alike.
0385335482|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much I couldn't put it down. It is a quick read and an enjoyable one. The other two are worth buying and reading. Sophie Kinsella is a great writer with so much humor and wit and her character Becky Bloomwood is funny and smart. Loved the book. I give the other 2 books a 5 star rating!!!<br />GO and READ it now!
B000059XUO|4.0|I'm not a wonderful reviewer, but I just want to say that I loved the movie.  The movie allows a gothic industrial feel that makes the viewer feel depressed.  Sitting there, I didn't know whether to get an adrenaline rush or put my head between two pillows and cry.  It made a great effect to the movie.  This movie  has stood the test of time.
B000002G60|5.0|It was by chance that I overheard a song off this CD in a movie and was surprised to see Suzanne Vega in the credits -it was so different from the her style from the 80s which I had never liked. I decided to give this CD a try and have absolutely fallen in love with this sexy, sophisticated version of Suzanne Vega.<br />The influence of Mitchell Froom is obvious with music emanating from cool, lounge-yish tunes to hints of smooth jazzy Brazilian rythms. The melding of the music and lyrics is pure pleasure to the senses. I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer that felt the songs sounded too similar to each other - each song had its own character and this is why I still haven't tired of playing it over and over again.
B0000648WZ|3.0|While this is an enjoyable action flick for occassional scifi fans, its a great disappointment to Heinlein's fans. The movie completely misses the political and military points about responsibility, priviledge and power that Heinlein was trying to make about human society. More important, where's the powered combat suit?? Let's hope when SciFi channel is done with Battlestar Gallatica, they'd be willing to take on Starship Troopers, since their Dune was far more faithful to Herbert than the movie.
0743455967|5.0|Best selling author Stephen King has taken a foray in the world of non-fiction and has written a brief guide on how to be a better writer. King's book begins with a autobiography describing the events in his life that led him to writing and how his &quot;career&quot; as a writer evolved from writing for his mother, to selling short stories to magazines, to writing best-selling novels. King deals candidly with his own personal demons and his personal relationships. The next portion of the book is King's guide on how to be a better writer. In it he offers everything from how to write better dialogue, to tips on description, to the best environment to write in. The next section of the book was added on in the wake of the author being struck by a van. Just like the rest of the book, King does not pull any punches describing the accident or his recovery. Most importantly he relates the accident to his writing and the reader goes away with the feeling that if King can go back to writing after his accident surely we can make it through our first book.<br />I've read quite a few books on how to become a better writer (I'm an aspiring author myself, and I'm going to be honest, I'm not very good. I'm not going to try and tell you I'm writing the next great American novel because I'm not) and most are written by authors with one novel to their credit and I can almost guarantee its one you have never heard of. This is a book written by a man who has sold more novels that almost anyone else. I'm willing to bet that if you go up to anyone the street and ask them to name five Stephen King books off the top of their head they can do it. That alone makes this book worth buying. Kings candor in speaking about his early life and the accident with the van also help keep the readers interest and make this more then just another how-to-write book. The section that deals with writing is also very good. You have to accept some of King's tips, he obviously know what he's doing. This sectionchanged my perspective about how-to-write.<br />If you are an author or a fan with more then a passing interest in Stephen King I would advise you to pick up this book. This book offers an overview of how a man becomes a best-selling author and a valueable how-to on writing.
B00005OBSD|5.0|I have just received this new remastered version and it is absolutely fantastic! The sound quality is excellent, especially considering that it was recorded in the late sixties. The drums have been cleaned up and the guitars / vocals subtly tweaked. The bonus tracks are great especially 'Visions of Hell' and 'Woman by the sea' which later was released as 'Remember' on the Fire and Water album. I'm going to replace my existing Free CDs with these new remasters!
B00005JM03|5.0|I have not seen a movie this good in awhile.  I found it completely entertaining and 100% enjoyable.  The cast and crew did a great job and so did the Mini Coopers.  Very cool stunts with the cars, very good thieves, and very good heist(s).  This is a movie I will see many times while it is in theatres, I will buy it and I will watch it many times more.  Go see it!
B000002MY3|5.0|I was serving as a Peace Corps HIV/AIDs Volunteer in Southern Africa towards the end of my two year assignment when this album was released.  I had heard of it from the Voice of America's count down, but had never actually heard a cut.  I bought it while vacationing in South Africa just to see what the fuss was about.<br />Wow.<br />It was a Relevation.  Just blew me out of the water.  Every single song was a jewel and almost every song I could relate to; One Hand in My Pocket in particular captured the contrasts I felt of being a young priviledged American living for an extended period of time in the developing world, trying to make inroads against the tide of the epidemic.  I made amazing friends and lost some as well.  It was was a wonderous and devastating exeperience.  In fact, this album is so ingrained in me as a part of that time, I haven't been able to listen to it since I returned.  It hurts too much.<br />Must be a strange strange thing to write a piece of work that so many people connect to.<br />To quote Alanis's next album:  &quot;Thank you.&quot;
0684800713|4.0|It is very hard to argue that Hemingway's writing style is not simple perfection, and his books are always enjoyable, but (and maybe it's me) I always have a bit of a hard time relating to his characters. They always seem to be wealthy gamesmen traveling the world safari hunting, or fishing, or (in the case of this book) a little of both. Should every reader be able to relate to every character in every book? I doubt it, so I would still urge anyone to pick this one up, but you may find that the characters seem a little distant and hard to sympathize with, in many cases. It's about an American newspaper man living in Europe and his wealthy, or once-wealthy, friends as they travel to Spain to fish, drink, watch the running of the bulls, drink, enjoy the bullfights, drink, screw, drink, and fight. It's a short book -- give this one a try.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Old school hip-hop revived using real instruments and very basic mixes. It's St-Jean Baptiste here in Quebec so I was lucky to find this CD in a opened local CD store in my town. Just by cover, you could tell that there was a big change, BEP has expended a lot they musical horizon. This time a lot more trumpet is being used to give a more dominant sound and there's as plenty of bass for old Black Eyed Peas enthousiasts. They addition of pop singer Fergie gives them are sound that should be more appreciated than on Fronting The Back or Bridging The Gap. Most titles given to the song really give us a good idea of the song's mood, it's highly emotional and integer, just like jamming session. There's better guitar than on the previous CDs but on a negative side, the melody doesn't very too much in a song and it can get repetitive. I just heard it one time but I'll give my appreciation on all songs another time... for those who aren't sure about the BEP-Papa Roach collaboration, well it turned out really nice!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|It's easy to see why. This new up-and-coming band has truly created a masterpiece with Fallen. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that these guys are an average Linkin Park [...]. Although many reviewers (cough, Rolling Stone, cough) and some customers have said that that is what they are, with their gimmick being a hot chick singing instead of a guy. Honestly, I have no idea how people came to this conclusion. What Linkin Park does is they take a beat, change it into a set of power chords that assault your ears for the choruses, and add a mixture of singing and rapping for the lyrics.<BR>      That is definitely not what Evanescence does. They do something nearly impossible for me to describe without thinking (and its the first day of my summer vacation, so I don't want to do that). But they definitely do something amazing, and I think it has to do with the epic and visceral sound they produce. This isn't just singer, a guitarist or two, a bass player, and a drummer (although that is the basic quartet that makes up Evanescence). Instead, Evanescence seems to have an entire orchestra to back it up that takes every song to the epic and great scale they are all on. Combine this this with Amy Lee's great, beautiful, surreal, and sometimes haunting voice and lyrics, and you have a timeless rock album that is introducing the world to what will surely be one of the greatest rock bands ever if they can keep this kind of quality consistent.
B000089CJI|5.0|A great cd!! Highly recommended!! Tracks 1,2, and 4 are the best in my opinion. District Sleeps Alone Tonite absolutely one of the most poignant but still upbeat songs!
0004704746|5.0|This is an edition of the complete works of Shakespeare that I keep next to my bed. No heavier than a large fashion magazine and absolutely readable, it is my favorite. The glossary is useful, the commentary is brief, and the cover folds back for comfortable beach reading. This edition brings Shakespeare into focus as an intimate whose work and life and suffering are not in any way distant from ours. Given the genius of the work, this particular edition encourages an easier relationship because the book itself is so easy to use.(When no one's around, pull it out and read a speech or two aloud) An excellent any-occasion gift that will be used and appreciated, especially by students, because it is so very convenient!
078401213X|3.0|Being a mathematical person myself (I have a Masters degree in Statistics) I was intrigued by the premise of the movie but in the end I was left with more questions than answers and was left dangling.  The plot includes too much of the mathematical detail (and medical detail, listing all the drugs Cohen was taking!), often coming across as nurdy.<br />The solution seemed too straightforward and practical, with many details lacking here (unlike in the build-up).  I thought the final mix might include emotions, basically a more relationship-centric argument, especially as the plot did allude to the potential for something to happen between Cohen and his neighbour, but this didn't come up at all.<br />This all said, Darren Aronofsky is clearly a very talented director.  His use of the black&white medium and close-up camera shots in Pi were a stroke of genius - it certainly helped one get into Cohen's mind.  Requiem for a Dream is an outstanding movie but Pi fails to deliver because he took on a very weighty and complex subject in his first attempt at a motion picture.  The problem lies in the screenplay (which he co-wrote), and not his direction, however.<br />It is interesting to note Aronofsky's use of some of the effects that he would later use in Requiem for a Dream, especially the fast-forward pill-popping sequence which was always worth a chuckle in both movies (in a dark sort of way).
B000050XEI|5.0|I love Enya's music. So much so, ONLY TIME was the processional at my wedding. Enya has a rich, soothing voice with a style unique to her. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is an ideal example of her uncompromising attention to detail and pursuit of perfection of her musical artistry. The album is a combination of happy, dark, reflective, mystical, upbeat and ethereal styling. How can one artist accomplish this? That is what defines Enya.<br />ONLY TIME is the song that stands out most in my mind. The original version on this album (as opposed to the remix) is contemplative, yet somehow reassuring. It brings the message of having faith and hope. &quot;Who can say if your love grows as your heart chose? Only Time.&quot; As a side note, Enya is donating the total royalty earnings from sales of the ONLY TIME single to the Uniform Firefighters Association's Widows' and Children's Fund. &quot;My hope is that, in some small way, these funds can help to alleviate the concerns facing the families in the aftermath of 9-11, and other families of fire fighters who have been affected by a tragic loss of life,&quot; Enya said. &quot;My thanks go out to the UFA for all their efforts in helping these families.&quot;<br />A heart as beautiful as her music.<br />&quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; is the dark, mysterious song on this album. It combines latin lyrics (Summer Time) with a deliberate, slow beat. It is an interesting counterpoint to &quot;Wild Child&quot; which is definitely upbeat and more modern in style.<br />Throughout all the songs, one thing remains obvious. It's Enya. 100% Enya. She has a rather unique approach to vocals - they are almost all Enya. Enya records multiple tracks for the same recording, doing the vocals in perfect harmony. It is a shame Enya does not perform live, much. She is one superstar who has managed to avoid much of her adoring public.<br />I won't bore you by repeating my accolades for the remaining songs on the album; I think they are all wonderful.<br />Yes, I am an Enya fan - for life!an Enya fan - for life!
B000068OSK|4.0|...and they got even better, with \\"De Stijl\\", especially, and \\"Elephant\\".<br />Good garage-blues-rock, with a scaled-down sound (just guitar and drums).  Reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's first two albums, and you can't get a much bigger compliment than that.  Gets better with each listen, as good albums should.  <br />The only gripe I have is that there is a degree of \\"sameness\\" between the tracks - they could have done better by trimming a few tracks off the album, and maybe worked on introducing some more variety.<br />The best tracks are \\"Stop breaking down\\" (a cover of the Robert Johnson classic, though for the definitive version listen to the Rolling Stones' version on \\"Exile on Main Street\\"), \\"Suzy Lee\\" and \\"Sugar never tasted so good\\".
0380789019|3.0|The beginning of Gaiman's story had me hooked.  I was intrigued with the idea of a mystical parallel existence, and became immediately interested in the female protagonist (Door) and her story.  As soon as the story takes us into London Below, however, it became a bit choppy, losing its initial momentum.<br />The world of London Below is a somewhat interesting fantasy realm, where rats are intelligent and the origins of some of London's place names are revealed in a \\"punny\\" way (e.g. there really is an earl's court at Earls Court).  Space itself seems to operate under different rules in London Below, making for some creative travels between the city rooftops and unimaginable depths.  Within this world, a story unfolds that ranges between interesting and unbelievable, never quite engaging me completely, but never causing me to stop reading.<br />Many of the characters are quite interesting, Door, Croup and Vandemar, and de Carabas among them.  Richard Mayhew, the male protagonist, is a bit of a disappointment though.  As pointed out by other reviewers, his reactions to the extraordinary things that are happening to him are so low-key as to be unbelievable.  Perhaps the author's intent was to show that a man living in the U.K. can be so beaten into conformity by society that he is incapable of reaction.  But if this is the case, it makes Mayhew simply one more tongue-in-cheek aspect of Gaiman's London Below, and hardly a realistic main character.<br />All in all, I found Neverwhere \\"okay\\".  Certainly not as well written as American Gods, which I would recommend you read instead.  Either way, you might read this book to kill time, but keep your expectations in check.
B00004XONN|1.0|Sure, it must have been hard to follow up two of the greatest albums of all time, The Bends and OK Computer, with anything like those in quality, but they could at least have tried.  Kid A is absolute rubbish, full of synthetic sounds and incoherent, and when they are discernable, pointless, lyrics.<br />If Radiohead wanted to experiment with new directions before settling back to what they do best - good, tight, guitar-filled emotionally charged rock - they should have just kept it to themselves, instead of releasing it and conning us loyal fans into paying good money for c**p like Kid A.<br />In the history of music there have been worse albums made, though not many, but there has never been a worse album made by so talented a band.
B000005RZ4|5.0|I was stationed in England in 1987 with the Air Force and saw these guys in a club. Very cool show. Smooth, layered, jazzy, thoughtful lyrics, very talented musicians. Buy the album, you will really enjoy them. Wet, Wet, Wet is a band from the same era and musical style, although a little more poppy.
B00005B4GU|1.0|The rubbish Radiohead started creating with Kid A continues on Amnesiac.  Once again full of synthetic sounds and incoherent, and when they are discernible, pointless, lyrics.<br />Amnesiac is marginally better than Kid A (0.2 stars versus Kid A's zero) due to glimpses of the form they showed on The Bends and OK Computer, most apparent on the track \\"I might be wrong\\".  There were no such favours on Kid A.<br />Hopefully, OK Computer hasn't done to Radiohead what The Joshua Tree did to U2.  After the commercial and critical acclaim achieved by The Joshua Tree, U2 thought they could release anything and it would work.  So after the Joshua Tree U2 produced only rubbish, passing it off as deep intellectual rock when in fact they were just trying to show off how clever and cryptic they could be, ending up producing pretentious, boring pop and ripping off their loyal fans.
B000099T2L|5.0|At only 21 years, Beyonce Knowles has already set a name not only in the recording industry but in Hollywood too. And to set the lasting effect of her name, she releases a sensuous, beautiful new album DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE. With various producers on the album such as Missy Elliot and The Neptunes, DANGEROUSLY puts a vibe that catapults Beyonce on top of the R&amp;B throne. Guest artists Jay-Z (twice), Sean Paul, and even Luther Vandross gives this album sure heavy rotation in stereo systems. Songs like &quot;Signs,&quot; &quot;Speechless,&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot; brings the natural harmony out from the beautiful artist. Basically, for all those who like a real R&amp;B album, the middle tracks are essential for romantic moods. Expect more to come from Beyonce since this album forecasts a promising future musically for this beautiful Virgo from Houston, TX.

0156027321|5.0|Two stories are told about how a teenage boy survived many months in a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean before finally making it to safety.  The first of those stories occupies 99% of the book.  The second story is dragged out of him by investigators, and is told at the very end.  Obviously, the second story is the true one, and it is absurd for reviewers to claim that they don't know which is true.  The second story will shock you and make you sad, and it will make you understand why the boy had to construct the other story.  I don't want to spoil it so you will have to read the book to find out what happens.  The one thing I can tell you without hurting your enjoyment of the book is that it is excellent and will stay with you like few stories will.  I don't give out five stars lightly.
B00004TDRD|5.0|When director Steven Spielberg set out to create the motion picture &quot;Jaws&quot;, he had no idea how much trouble the film would cause him nor just how incredible, exciting, and important it would eventually become.  <br />The film ventures into the world of Amity Island, which is feverishly awaiting its July 4th holiday weekend to create quite a business for the town.  But when a flesh-eating Great White shark enters the town's beaches, it is up to the town sherriff (Roy Scheider in perhaps his best performance outside of &quot;The French Connection&quot;), a geeky graduate scientist (the always admirable Richard Dreyfuss), and the town fish gamer (played by Robert Shaw, the film's best performance by far) to save the day. <br />Spielberg plays the tension like a sneaky household cat ready to pounce on a silly toy.  He knows exactly when his temptations will take over and when he will strike, but the audience is left to guess in fear as the shark terrorizes the small island.  What makes &quot;Jaws&quot; so great is not just the fine soundtrack by John Williams, the special effects and the lovable shark machine &quot;Bruce&quot;, but the fact that it allows the childish fears in all of us to creep up on us and still make the hair on our necks tingle.<br />Spielberg would later create even more popular and elaborate masterpieces such as &quot;E.T&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, but for those who truly enjoy film and its impact on an audience, &quot;Jaws&quot; can certainly bite with the best of them.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I've been a dedicated Green Day fan since 1992 when Kerplunk came out. I've enjoyed watching them evolve over the years. I think they are doing a teriffic job!<br />I am also glad to see that they are releasing material that they want to play. They released this album not giving a [hoot] if it would sell big, just like thier last 2 albums, Insomniac and Nimrod; both a step away from the multi-platinum selling Dookie.<br />The new punkers now-a-days don't give Green Day the credit they deserve, since they have revived and shaped the new punk rock music they listen to today. They went back to thier roots with Insomniac (a great album). I remember seeing the 3 of them of MTV one day (MTV [is bad] these days), and Mike was saying (In reference to \\"Nimrod\\"): \\"We've been waiting our whole lives to make this music, so if nobody buys it... well, we got 3 guys right here who will buy it and listen to it.\\" How can you not give this great band props with an attitude like that.<br />The terrific ballad \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\\" seemed to free them even more as punk rockers, leaving the gate wide open for thier new release \\"Warning\\". This carefully constructed 12 track studio album is filled with infectious lyrics, and beautiful insturmentation. I love every track on this 12 song album.<br />Some of the best tracks include:<br />  01. Warning **<br />  02. Blood, Sex, And Booze **<br />  03. Church On Sunday<br />  04. Fashion Victim<br />  05. Castaway<br />  06. Misery **<br />  07. Deadbeat Holiday<br />  08. Hold On<br />  09. Jackass<br />  10. Waiting **<br />  11. Minority **<br />  12. Macy's Day Parade **<br />Thanks for reading. It's all about Green Day man!
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was a fan of Led Zepplin's during some of the band's best years, and more than two decades later I can vividly remember sitting around with friends and lamenting that the group had never released a real top-quality live album.<br />Finally, we have one.<br />My musical tastes have changed more than a little since the days I passed listening to Houses of the Holy and Led Zepplin II when I should have been studying my algebra notes. I picked up How The West Was Won on whim at an airport music store, hoping to enjoy a little nostalgia when I returned home. But what I got was far more than that: this CD may be one of the most enjoyable classic rock recordings ever made. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are at their best here, with the kind of bold, bluesy and energetic intensity that inspired two generations of musicians. The editing is good, with little dead time between tunes, and diversity of styles from this single set make what is a fairly pricey item seem like a bargain.<br />Until I bought this CD, I had not listened to a Led Zepplin recording in years, but once I started listening to this it made me feel like it is the collection I had been waiting for all along. Well done ... I just wish it had come out a long time ago.
0385509456|5.0|A remarkable book, offering a remarkable journey through the mind of an exceptional character. The book's hero and narrator, Christopher Boone, could easily have become precious or irritating, but Mr. Haddon strikes a difficult balance. Christopher is wonderfully sympathetic--I suffered with him throughout his difficult and courageous journey to London--but he's also tremendously hard for others to fathom. I highly recommend this book.
B000002U9W|5.0|This album cover has hung in every living room I've lived in over the past 20 years. It symbolizes a highly creative period in music, when vinyl became a playground for great art, both aural and visual. Hence music tailored for one whole side of a record was a Pink Floyd trademark in those days. From the same class as 'Ummagumma', 'Meddle', 'More', 'Relics' and 'Obscured by Clouds', 'Atom Heart Mother' is a must for those into music with less attitude and more musicality. Heck, this was even required listening for classical music students in the Seventies.. Lend it your ears now if you haven't done so yet.
B00009TB5G|5.0|It has been a long time since I've seen Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers in a theater and now I can't wait to get the DVD!  I do find The Two Towers to be better than the first part, The Fellowship of the Ring, because of the much increased action and comedy sequences.  The Two Towers focuses on group of characters throughout the movie so you get to know characters like Pippin and Merry a lot better.  ....So here is the thing,  The special extended edition is coming out again just like before.  All of the documentaries and material on Disc 3 and 4 seems like it will easily match the material on the FotR Disc 3 and 4 of the extended edition and the extended ed. of FotR including the extra materials was extremely awesome by the way.  The difference is that FotR had about 30 minutes of added footage.  TTT's Extended Edition will have over 40 minutes of added footage.  Woohooo.  Hey,  Longer is a lot better when you are talking about LotR because I can never get enough of it.  It is too bad that the extended edition won't come out for another 4-ish months, but until then... I can watch the theatrical edition dvd that I am also getting.  <br />     I find that buying both the theatrical and extended edition is needed in this case with The Two Towers.  The theatrical edition will first of all hold you off until you get the extended edition.  Also,  The theatrical edition has \\"The Long and the Short of It\\" which is Sean Astin's short film made while shooting LotR (I really want to see this).... It has a few tv documentaries.... It has a preview of the Extended Ed. dvd AND a 10 minute preview of Return of the King!!!  It also has some short featurettes that were featured on the website and other stuff like music videos and trailers.  Guess what.... The Extended Edition has none of that stuff that I just said.... So it is like you are getting totally new stuff on the Extended Edition... The ext. ed. is like an entirely new movie almost with the hours of GREAT special features and documentaries you get that you will not have ever seen even if you get the theatrical version.  I suggest to people that you buy both so that you don't miss out on things like the Sean Astin film... If you only have enough money to buy one, then definitely buy the Extended Edition......<br />The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is proving to be my favorite movie of all time.  I hope that others will find out about it, rent it, or see it in theaters and enjoy it as much as I do.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Does Bjiork have a twin brother? If so, He's joined up with Led Zeppelin and they've taken a serious acid trip! The former singer and guitarist of &quot;At The Drive In&quot; lead this band but drummer, Jon Theodore almost steals the show with his latin-Keith Moon vibe. A very creative album with great playing and singing, I had to play it over again after hearing it for the first time because it blew by like a raging tornado. Get it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta have managed an impressive feat with their first full-length CD: music that will appeal to listeners from just about every genre imaginable. You will hear and read comparisons to Rush, Santana, punk and thrash, latin folk music, Radiohead, and many others, and all of those comparisons, while totally viable, are somewhat incomplete simply because they fail to take into account the full range of massive talent evident in this recording. Even the spastic thrash of ATDI reappears at certain points in the disc, but only breifly and with great effect. <br />We have been treated to some amazing music in 2003, including the blood brothers, Radiohead and now The Mars Volta. Don't miss adding this piece of brilliance to your music collection.

You will hear and read comparisons to Rush, Santana, punk and thrash, latin folk music, Radiohead, and many others, and all of those comparisons, while totally viable, are somewhat incomplete simply because they fail to take into account the full range of massive talent evident in this recording. Even the spastic thrash of ATDI reappears at certain points in the disc, but only breifly and with great effect. <br />We have been treated to some amazing music in 2003, including the blood brothers, Radiohead and now The Mars Volta. Don't miss adding this piece of brilliance to your music collection.
B000099T2L|5.0|This is a great debut album by a truly talented woman. The first four songs are wonderful, infectious pop with a touch of hip hop. Beyonce also exceeds while singing ballads, showing emotion and soul without resorting to the vocal acrobatics of people like Cristina Aguilera. She can sing R&B, she can rock, she can perform hip-hop. This is an album people from 12-55 can enjoy.  If you''ve given up on today's Top 40, this is a record to renew hope. Get it today!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever, and I can say it's not a chick flick.  This was directed by the say person who directed &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; and there are similarities.  There are a few actors that are the same and the characters are just as odd and interesting as in &quot;The City of Lost Children,&quot; which is also a good movie.  Amelie is a feel good movie and I've seen it quite a few times.  This is a must see, and it's on my TOP 10.
B00005JLK1|1.0|good lord what a horrible movie.  You have no sympathy for the characters and no explanation or background as to how they react.  Don't even bother renting this it is plain garbage.
B000001GPX|5.0|If someone was a beginning classical music listener and only wanted ONE CD, this is what I would recommend.  This recording very aptly demonstrates the power, emotion and passion that is &quot;classical music.&quot;  I can think of very few other recordings that capture both the technique and the musicality/style of a piece as effectively as this (though there are a few, see Mravinsky's Tchaik 4,5,6 with the Leningrad Phil for example).<br />As has been uttered scores of times above, this is the ultimate, quintessential, definitive Beethoven 5 and 7.  While this may not seem like something new, consider the source: someone who has, in the past, not been a huge Kleiber fan.  I own/have heard several other Kleiber recordings including the highly regarded Brahms 4/Vienna SO and have not particularly cared for his musical vision.  This, however, is different.  This recording absolutely embodies Beethoven's writing, his personality and the intensity with which HE conducted his own music.<br />This is absolutely, positively a MUST HAVE for your classical collection.
B00009L1TA|1.0|how low can Travolta sink.  Basic is just another agonizing nail in his coffin.  This movie rates near Battle field earthfor it's ability to grate on your nerves.<br />Rent it with a lot of friends and split the cost.  A dollar is all it is worth to see this mess.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.A.T.U. is an awesome group and they put out great songs on this album, \\"200Km/H in the Wrong Lane\\". With all the buzz and scandal sworming around t.A.T.u., the content of their music seems to be lost on most people. However, they provide catchy, danceable songs that more people should know. The Russian versions on this album are great to listen to, too. I totally recommend this album to anyone looking for something a little different than typical American pop. Go t.A.T.u.!!!!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce's CD is so good!  This CD will turn a non Destiny's Child/Beyonce Fan into a Beyonce Fan!  There is a song on there for everybody.  Each song has a great beat and beautiful lyrics. The CD has some uptempo songs like \\"Crazy In Love\\" but for the most part Beyonce has some incredible slow jams on there.  My personal favorite is \\"Speechless\\".  Like I said there is a song on there for everybody.  Trust me, you will love this CD!  It is and will be in heavy rotation on my cd player!  So what are you waiting for? Hurry up and buy this CD!
B000099T2L|5.0|We all know  Beyonce Knowles.  She is the lead singer in Destiny's Child.  She is here to prove to the world that she is 21 and able to do what ever she feels, from making love to clubbin with her girls.  I purchased this album. I have been waiting for her to break loose and make her own CD since last summer when she did work it out.

ALBUM OF THE YEAR, she will get nominated for a grammy, trust me. Haters, lay off Bee now, she done did it again , but this time she got her own album, andits hotter than hot.  Beyonce, do your thing and no matter what people say about you, you know that you got it all from looks to talents to a wonderful heart.  I reccommend this album to anyone.  Much love, shout out to all of Bainbridge GA, aka Port City... HOLLA BACQ!
B0000942LT|5.0|Staind has always been a band that has evolved on every CD. and thats what this CD is, more mature music. 14 shades of grey is one of the best albums by staind. it's better then Dysfunction but not quite as good as Break The Cycle.&quot;Price To Play&quot; shows that staind can still rock as hard as any band.but songs such as &quot;Zoe Jane&quot; shows the lyrically maturity of Aaron and other songs such as &quot;Layne&quot; shows maturity as a whole. while paying tribute to the late vocalist of Alice In Chains. So my advice to you is buy this album if you liked Break The Cycle and you're hardcore staind fan. but for those who are Dysfunction and Tormented metalheads, then i suggest another album &quot;year of the spider&quot;by Cold.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I don't know about this.  No James Cameron.  No Linda Hamilton.  Essentially the same plot as T2.  Besides, since all the terminator parts were destroyed at the end of T2, how was Skynet invented?  I suspect we're in for some incomprehensible time-travel mumbo-jumbo, an Arnold terminator that cries, and some female cyborg breast shots.  Will they shoot bullets, a la Austin Powers fem-bots?
6304493681|5.0|Along with Akira, this ranks as my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation is incredible. Very detailed with excellent use of CG. Also, the character design is also very good, not quite like any other anime I've seen. The plot revolves around the cyborg Motoko and a mysterious hacker. It gets quite complex, with all kinds of political machinations, so it may take a few viewings to understand.
B00003Q43A|1.0|Rarely has so much money been wasted on a movie production. That is, if your yardstick for money well spent is the quality of the final product. But if you measure by return-on-investment, well, that's another matter. And by all accounts, Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich raked in big bucks with this film, and continue to do so with the video release. Really, I wonder why so many are taken in by this piece of garbage. Okay, I've set the tone: I'm not mincing words.<br />What this box office blockbuster gives us is a silly, shabbily-told story, moronic dialogue, annoying, unfunny jokes that keep repeating, characters with about as much depth as cardboard cutouts, and the worst acting this side of Ed Wood-- all dressed up in spectacular special effects. Oh sure, it's all in the spirit of retro sci-fi fun, but I contend that a 1996 movie should be judged by 1996 standards. And when you see so many glaring lapses in basic storytelling in a big-budget Hollywood production, you really can't be very forgiving.<br />An Air Force fighter plane outraces an alien spacecraft thousands of years more advanced. The First Lady survives her helicpoter being blown to bits, and emerges with just a few scratches and bruises. The girlfriend of one of the heroes just happens to find said First Lady in the wreckage of the destroyed city. Later, said hero, an Air Force pilot, also conveniently locates said girlfriend mere moments after landing his chopper in the city. <br />In the first place, what was the point of the First Lady surviving, only to succumb to internal injuries later? So she could deliver her stupid line, \\"Liar\\" one more time when her husband tells her she'll be fine?<br />Wait, there's more. A bunch of civilians with limited flying experience -- including a drunken old cropduster, complete with bottle in hand -- undergo a quickie training course in how to fly fighter planes, and then go off to fight the aliens in their spacecraft. And guess who emerges the biggest hero? Yougot it, the old drunk. Meanwhile, earlier-mentioned Air Force pilot has somehow managed to learn how to fly an alien craft. (\\"Excuse me, sir, I've seen these things in action, I know their maneuvering capabilities.\\" Yeah, right, so it's that simple.) Later, he outmaneuvers the far-advanced and presumably far-more-skilled alien pilots flying their own spacecrafts. And he does this in the mothership, which should be unfamiliar to him and familiar to them.<br />This is one of the highest-grossing films of all time? Cripes, no wonder scientists are looking for intelligent life on other planets. There's obviously not enough of that here.
0385507755|5.0|Like a drug, this book is hard to put down, as has been said by others.  I am only on page 170, I don't care how the book \\"comes out,\\" I don't care if some of the characters are exaggerated.  I like this book because of the excruciatingly slow revelation of health dawning in a sick individual, like a slow intermittent drip of clean water into a bucket of filthy water.  If you have a friend in recovery, this book would be a good gift.  <BR>I do have one question. Why doesn't  Hazelden permit NOVACAINE, which doesn't pass through the blood/brain barrier, to be used for patients' painful dental procedures??  It would have helped some.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Amongst the numerous all-time favorite classics of mines, 1988's \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" stands out brightly against almost every other all-time favorite movie of mines. The reason \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" stands out in this case is not only is it fun, but brilliantly joins together two separate worlds, the real world, and the toon universe in such a brilliant way, there's no way one can resist loving every moment of this classic.<br />The plot revolves around a humorless and even cold-hearted ACME detective named Eddie Valiant (Played by Bob Hoskins) who is on a case to investigate the murder of toon president Marvin Acme and also the killing of his brother by a `toon' which has embittered Eddie against associating with the toon world. Unfortunately for him, much to Valiant's disgust, he is sought after for help by a toon who is one the run, being considered the prime suspect but the truth is, a criminal crime lord named Judge Doom (Played by Christopher Lloyd) is the one who is responsible for the murders of Marvin Acme and also of Eddie's brother and not only that, Doom is on a spree to take over toon town, destroy the `caf&eacute; district' and replace it with a super freeway, jammed with smog-generating traffic, & lined with gas stations, billboards, and giant strip malls `as far as the eye can see'. Now with the help of the twitchy Roger Rabbit, Detective Valiant is now on the case to foil the evil Judge Dooms plans, and save both the `real' world, and the toon universe from his malicious ambitions.<br />I just don't know where to begin to explain the high level of brilliant casting and great plot that propels this already great movie to unforgettable classic status. Each of the two separate worlds, the `real' world, and the toon world, are just in a chaotic state of fun as Roger Rabbit and his sidekick/nemesis team up in their fight against their common enemy Judge Doom and his `toon' thugs and to find out who is/was responsible for the murders of Marvin Acme and Eddie Valiant's brother. From here, it's an incredibly wild and often hilarious ride as they go on their mission to stop Doom from being able to take over the toon world and build his `superfreeway' and urban sprawl `as far as the eye can see' and turning the toon world into a giant, smog-ridden suburb.<br />Christopher Lloyd's eccentric personality reaches it's peak with his awesome and chillingly funny role as the main villain Judge Doom.<br />From what I'm guessing is that those who were involved in the making of this classic went through painstakingly hard work, drawing over 840, 000 animation cels to create the characters and then they were eventually incorporated into the live action shoots and voila! You have a brilliant yet laugh-inducing classic. I don't know about you but the crew must have had lots of fun making this movie. In the end, it all results in an amazing and extremely hilarious classic for the ages. \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is one of the best movies that 1988 produced. Not only does it bring lots and lots of laughs but combines the humor with a mix of brainless but intelligent dialogue and outstanding storylines.and Eddie Valiant's brother.

0471603864|5.0|Griffiths' book provides an ideal introduction to particle physics for the undergraduate who is desperate to find a comprehensive treatment that is truly understandable. I was greatly disappointed by Griffiths' books on electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, but he really hit the mark on this one. There is the usual introductory material on the Standard Model, relativistic kinematics, symmetries and bound states, but his presentations of QED, Feynman calculus, decays and interactions are clearly written and geared for the student who has been frustrated by the obtuseness of other so-called introductory texts. His exposition on gauge theories, the Yang-Mills field and the Higgs mechanism is elementary but enlightening and even entertaining. <br />Griffiths' sly wit is in great evidence in this text, and this is one of the reasons why it is so enjoyable. Although he displays a similar witty vein in his other texts, it just doesn't succeed as it does for this book. If you want to be able to calculate particle decay rates and interaction cross sections and have fun doing it, Griffiths' book is an excellent investment.
B000067JBN|4.0|I would have rated this one only 3 stars, if not for the potent charisma of Orlando Jones, who is quickly coming into his own as an actor.  This is a decent story based on a classic adventure.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, though, but didn't there seem to be an extraordinary amount of Guy Pearce close-ups?  I think he's good-looking and all, but man-oh-man, it was as if the camera crew had a crush on him or something!  Samantha Mumba did an unremarkable job in her (granted) very limited role.  I'm okay with this for the kids--it does, after all, have that remarkable H.G. Wells foundation, which has never been a bad thing.
B000006045|5.0|I adore this group and especially this album.  I got it the day it was released (as I have with their recent album.)  I have since played this so much and let friends borrow it so often that I have had to purchased it 3 times (no, I don't have a CD burner yet.)  I think it is a great album for relaxing, background to parties and especially love-making.  They have yet to dissapoint me with anything.  Too good for words!
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book, it was meaningful to me. I believe it to be a true story. I too, must turn this into a discussion forum. I found parts of it humorous, though some may not have. And the point of this is to let all of you who overlooked the ending, as my mother did, know that perhaps we can't so easily guess which story is true.I'm worried now about spoiling the ending for those who have yet to read the book...so if you dont want it spoiled, stop reading this! Now at the end Pi tells a second story, do you find it peculiar that the first story had so much more detail? I know i never pay that close attention when events occur in my life, and yet everything symbolized everything else. Pi, himself said: &quot; The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it to be, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn't that make life a story?&quot;<BR>He could have very well interpreted the last story into the first because the last was so terrible. Then again who knows the working of a young man's mind? <BR>Also i would like to add that i do and will forever believe in God, and it is because not only do I have faith but because I am a woman of science. Proof is about you, every effect has a cause, eh? well if God didn't start the motion then who did?<br />I will never know what story is true..i hope its the one with animals though.I know this may have no relavence to anyone out there, but i hope it intrigues you to buy the book.( not a bad argument coming from a 14-year old though ;) )
B00000K19E|5.0|First: awesome film and DVD.<BR>There isn't really anything bad I can say about this DVD.  Of course, extra scenes not included in the theatrical release would have been nice, but oh well.  If there is any drawback at all it is this : one of the primary special features goes overboard in giving a synopsis of the plot and explaining what the matrix is.  Normally, people watch the special features after having seen the movie.  And if you've seen the movie already, you should certainly know all about the plot and what the matrix is.  So this feature comes off as very redundant, even patronizing.<BR>On the other hand, there is a very good music-only ( the score and the contributions by musical groups ) track of the film.<BR>I find that many people exaggerate their original impressions of this film when discussing Reloaded.  They act as though they all gave the first film a four-star rating when it came out, and they imply Reloaded doesn't hold up.  Unfortunately, this is an example of what could be called &quot;retroactive continuity&quot;: it didn't go down like that.  The quality of this film was only fully recognized after the fact.<BR>Also, even though it sounds like an unlikely statement, some airheads watch these films without fully understanding what's going on - like not knowing when characters are in the matrix and when they're not.  Test it.
B000099T2L|5.0|Well, first of all I love Beyonce and this Cd is different from anything you've ever heard! Her range has gotten higher and the sound is different. I love her!!! This Cd is tight.
B00005OWEG|5.0|OK, this is unquestionably a great film.  However, a lot of people seem to have a problem with the added scenes.  This is the version which has an advanced transfer and 50 or so minutes of added footage interleaved into the film ( not relegated to a deleted-scenes feature ).<BR>I am not one of those people who feel that the added scenes detract from the movie.  Sure, the theatrical version is tighter.<BR>But we're talking about a long Odyssey-like journey into the heart of darkness.  A little more weirdness along the way, including a French plantation sequence that doesn't seem to fit, just adds to the bizarre nature of the story.  If I'm REALLY into a film ( like this one ) my vote is always for an extended edition.  Of course, the interleaved extra footage in Fellowship of the Ring is much better, but it's nice to have the best possible transfer of Apocalypse Now as well as the extra footage.  I had some trouble getting the color to come out right at first, but that may have been partly due to my TV settings.  One thing about Paramount discs: for some reason they tend to involve scenes in which characters' faces are bathed in bright yellow light, and the print can look overwhelmed by the yellow light in such instances.<BR>If you're a fan of the Matrix you might be interested in seeing Larry Fishburne's first movie role, at a younger age.<BR>Also: Sheen, Duvall, and Brando are great.<BR>Harrison Ford's name appears on the front of the DVD box even though he's only in one scene.  But that's because he's Harrison Ford and you're not.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb has the guts to hold unpopular ideas on luck in life and in the markets. I happen to like to help those whom fate did not privilege and to think that those who became hotshots have been rather lucky. Taleb has the guts to tell them so. <BR>I am behind you!!!
0790729628|4.0|This is a seminal film, one of the original cyberpunk influences ( Gibson's Night City is seen here ) and a classic science fiction story with great effects for its time.  One could write a book of scholarly essays about the literary and symbolic connotations of the plot ( I know because somebody did write such a book, called Retrofitting Blade Runner, and it's at my house right now ).<br />There are some good things about this DVD.  The main thing is that the background seems to have been deliberately lightened somewhat from the tape version.  Maybe I had a bad copy or something, but to my recollection the VHS tape of this film is way too dark, to the point where you can't really see much in the street scenes.<br />Unfortunately, the DVD transfer has a major problem.  Even though the interior of each camera shot looks fine ( seemingly high-definition in places ), when the frame changes, there's an effect as though you're watching somebody quickly change slides in a projector.  It's frustrating and it makes you feel like you're watching a bootlegged version of the film.  It's like there's an unnecessary barrier between yourself and the clear version of the film.  And I really feel that the purpose of a DVD is to recreate the theatrical feel of a movie.<br />Does anyone know why this happens on certain Warner DVDs?  In defense of Warner, many of their DVDs are fine ( such as the cartoon of Lord of the Rings and their flagship \\"Matrix\\" offerings, for example ).  But it's really important to many people that a Special Edition of this film is due to come out, which ( we all presume ) will fix the transfer.<br />If you're reading all the reviews, you'll notice that some people pine away after the droning Harrison Ford voice-overs that were excised from the Director's Cut.  Ridley Scott is including the theatrical version in the Special Edition, because apparently he likes the voice-overs too.  In my opinion the removal of the voice-overs was a HUGE improvement.  They don't usually add anything and were placed in there originally so that people could follow the plot - which holds up very well without them.  It's much better to just sit back and take in the scenery and the Vangelis score when Ford is flying around in the police car.  Not every scene in a film needs to have somebody TALKING.<br />One final word: my 4 rating, by way of explanation, means that I give the movie a 5 on its own merits, but the DVD transfer brings the score down to a 4.  If I felt that the rating reflected on the DVD transfer only, it would be lower.ally add anything and were placed in there originally so that people could follow the plot - which holds up very well without them.

0142004235|5.0|What a fun book.  Steinbeck creates memorable characters in a sweeping soap opera.  If Oprah gets more people to read this one then more power to her.  Don't even think about watching the movie instead of reading the novel.  The movie leaves out all of the juicy stuff.
B000001GQY|5.0|I've just bought this incredible album! First of all, I think that it is a great value to have both of these highly rated performances in just one album at such a modest price! And to have the beautiful Fantasies (op.116) as a coupling is an added bonus!<br />These are among the grandest piano concertos ever written, thus both have been an essential pair within the piano concerto repertoire for a long time. Emil Gilels plays beautifully both of them. The passion and authority of these interpretations are beyond compare! Eugene Jochum and the Berliner Philharmoniker support him all the way with great orchestral sound and immense strength! The highly dramatic orchestral introduction of the first piano concerto is simply amazing, a brief and effective sample of things to come!<br />The remastering is quite good too, although at times I felt that the strings sounded a bit thin, especially in the second concerto.<br />All in all, I think that this is a great opportunity to have both of these fabulous concertos paired in one very desirable, and unexpensive album! Highly rated by both the Penguin and Gramophone guides, among others! Don't hesitate and buy it!
B000002E5J|2.0|ok a lot of 2 star reviews and 1 star reviews...but I am going to simply express my opinion- from my POV this is not Shakira's best work. Yes, I am aware it was her first record released worldwide. Yes, I'm aware of the hits Estoy Aqui, Antologia, Un Poco de Amor, Donde Estas Corazon and Pies Descalzos. But in my opinion, I just didn't find a lot to like on this album. Perhaps a lot of it has to do with the fact that she was younger and sounds a little less mature than on her other two albums(yes, I prefer Laundry Service over this one. So sue me) Starting with Estoy Aqui, it comes from her heart. She sounds very sweet on it. And I like the words. But not the music. I'd rate it with a 3 out of 5 stars. Next, Antologia. I know it's weird, I liked Moscas en la Casa, but not this one. I think it's because she sounded more mature on Moscas en la Casa. I'm not saying she sounds like a baby or like she's whining, she just sounds....different. 2 stars If you think I'm just gonna say bad things about this album, you're wrong! I LOVE Un Poco de Amor She uses a cool reggae beat and has a backup singer joining her. SHe even speaks in English for about 3 seconds! 5 stars Next is Quiero....uuugh. It just doesn't work for me. Sorry, Shakira. 1 star. Te Necesito is next. I kind of like it, I don't hate it like I hate Quiero or Pienso en Ti it's kind of slow and mellow, very relaxing. 3 stars. Vuelve is track 6, and here she is rockin'! I like this song, even though it wasn't a hit, and is one of the only songs on this album I like. 5 stars. I also like Te Espero Sentada, kind of in between a fast and a slow song and Pies Descalzos, Suenos Blancos, and award them 4 and 5 stars, respectively. Next is my least favorite song on the album, Pienso en Ti. It's way too slow and just...uuugh. 1 star At least it's short-only 2:27. Next is Donde Estas Corazon? I didn't like it, except for the one sort of rap part-2.5 stars. Finally, Se Quiere, Se Mata. About abortion, this song is totally rocking and closes triumphantly which was (for me, at least) a disappointing album. <br />Overall Grade:B-<BR>So, if you want Shakira back when she was innocent, pick this disc up. However, I'd recommend Donde Estan Los Ladrones? or Laundry Service anyday.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Some people here are making the review of the VHS Live at Wembley'86, but this is the DVD and for the first time in the history of Queen we have the FULL CONCERT, and what a venue.

Disc 1 contains the entire Saturday gig (almost two hours) remastered in vivid DTS 5.1 or PCM Stereo. The second disc collects both contemporary and brand-new material, including new interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor. \\"A Beautiful Day\\" is a good documentary made at the time. More exciting is the wealth of unseen footage, both from the Friday night show and the band in rehearsal. There are \\"Queen Cam\\" views of each band member, and a photo gallery. Most poignant is a time-lapse short, \\"Wembley Towers\\", showing the philistine destruction of these national monuments. It's a fitting epitaph for this great live band<br />DVD Description<BR>Track Listing: <br />One Vision <BR>Tie Your Mother Down <BR>In the Lap of the Gods <BR>Seven Seas of Rhye <BR>Tear it Up <BR>A Kind of Magic <BR>Under Pressure <BR>Another Ones Bites the Dust <BR>Who Wants to Live Forever <BR>I Want to Break Free <BR>Impromptu <BR>Brighton Rock Solo <BR>Now I'm Here <BR>Love of My Life <BR>Is This the World We Created <BR>(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care <BR>Hello Mary Lou <BR>Tutti Frutti <BR>Gimme Some Lovin' <BR>Bohemian Rhapsody <BR>Hammer to Fall <BR>Crazy Little Thing Called Love/8 Big Spender <BR>Radio Ga Ga <BR>We Will Rock You <BR>Friends Will Be Friends <BR>We are the Champions <BR>God Save the Queen<br />IN THE SECOND DVD the best is the Multi-camara angle GREAT<br />So good times ahead will wait for you if you buy this DVD<BR>MUSIC MAKES OUR DREAMS BETTER AND BIGGER, so keep listenig good music and be happy, till next time. <br />PS my appolagies for the english mistakes...but i tried my best.<BR>now go listen to RADIOHEAD, BEN HARPER, PINK FLOYD;LED ZEPPELIN,REM, METALLICA,NIRVANA, MILES DAVIDS, JIMI HENDRIX,BLUR,NINE INCH NAILS,D. MATTHEWS,JEFF BUCKEY,JOY DIVISION, ALANIS,AIMEE MAN and of course QUEEN because music brings the people togheter and the world a better place.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Radiohead are dull, boring, and overrated. Some songs are good but overall, this album seems like a chore to sit through. Certainly not an essential.
B0000931OG|5.0|I think Blur's new album Think Tank is their best yet.  It is an album where Damon does not have to collaborate with Graham's metal side.  The album is 100% Damon.  Which is evident in the way the songs are written with the same poppy sound mixed with a new funky sound influenced from a lot of different world music type styles.  The songs are very well structured with the great choruses that Damon is known for.  Each song has very well written progressions both musically and vocally.    <br />Guitar, Bass, Drums, and Keyboards are in this album as the other Blur albums.  However, now a lot of added percussion and world beat instruments are added.  <br />The album takes a few listens to appreciate.  At first listen I liked it, but did not fully appreciate it until I forced myself to listen to it more.  I then started to realize all of the cool instruments, and building progressions of both sound and mood this cd encompasses.<br />It is currently spinning on my cd every day since I purchased it, along with the Cure's last album Bloodflowers.<br />There are still a couple fast punky songs reminiscent of \\"Song 2\\".  They would be \\"Crazy Beat\\", and the short and limited lyrics of \\"We've got a file on you\\".<br />Then there are a few cool ballads that Damon is so good at.  These would be \\"Sweet Song\\" and \\"Battery in your Leg\\". <br />Also there were a lot of funky songs, where there is just a cool drum beat sort of hip hop, jazz, or reggae style, a cool bass line, drum beat or guitar riff, or some other cool instrument that makes each track very groovy and danceable.  Listen to the cd just to see how many instruments are in what appears to be a basic song.  After a few listens I regarded the tracks more as compositions than just songs. <br />These groovy songs would be \\"Ambulance\\", (\\"Out of Time\\" and \\"Caravan\\") which sort of are borderline ballads with funk added, \\"Good Song\\", &quot;On the way to the club\\", Damon almost raps on \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" my personal favorite because of the funky music and the soul sounding lyrics, \\"Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club\\", \\"Jets\\", and \\"Gene by Gene\\".<br />BTW, I saw them live about 2 weeks ago in Phoenix, and they played the whole album along with old songs.  They did not disappoint!  Blur is the best live band that I have had the pleasure of seeing.
B00004XONN|1.0|The rest of this album is just simply too boring to sit through. But then, I never really did like Radiohead too much.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Seeing Cher 4 times this past year in concert was more than a thrill. Having this DVD to remember it is a dream come true.
B000005JA8|5.0|This is a legendary album, one of my favorites. Every true Beefheart fan: give 5 stars! This low average is not enough!
0425170349|4.0|I read this book a few years ago when it came out and I thought it was a great read.  To be honest, this was the first Tom Clancy novel that I had ever read and I was not disappointed.  Because of this, however, I do not have a point of reference to compare to any of his other fiction work.<br />Clancy is a great story teller and the plot of the book was interesting and creative.  For me, it was a difficult book to put down and I found myself constantly wanting to read further (which is unusual for me). :P  Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|3.0|I'd have to agree that a lot of people need to give her a break. I really don't care if she's a &quot;poser&quot; or whatever some people claim, I care more about that she doesn't seem to be the brightest person in the world. And yes, she's manufactured, but so is 1/2 the pop industry and even some of the rest of the entertainment industry. Sure she can hardly play guitar, the lyrics really aren't too deep, but I must say I enjoyed the album. I especially enjoyed &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;. As a person, I'm not too sure I'd enjoy hanging out with her. But I didn't mind her album too much. Give it a try.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The ATDI boys plus some very talented and twisted cohorts (including the notorious Flea from RHCP) have managed to put out something that really breaks the mold. Can't really categorize it-just when you think it's hardcore, it's suddenly spins you into a psychedelic freeform daze. The more I listen to it, the more complex layers are revealed. And I have listened to it over &amp; over &amp; over again already. Even the songs that are remakes from the old EP are totally different. I will refrain from over hyping the album or making a bunch of comparisons. I'm done.<br />Point is: the album is amazing. Go out and buy it. Now.
B000002UDB|5.0|Everyone talks about Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt.Pepper or the White Album as the Beatle's magnum opus. Wrong. With EIGHT of their BEST songs on one album, Magical Mystery is the best and since the Beatles are the greatest(by virtue of writing more great songs in 7 years than any 4 other bands have written in 20) that makes this the GREATEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED. Concept shmoncept, I don't need no stinking concept.
B000089RVX|2.0|People are over rating them as a band. People are now trying to promote any band that has somehting new or different. I simply look at the music, i pay no attention to the fact that this is a nu-metal band with a female singer... and I see them as being similar to all of the other nu-metal linkin park type bands out there. However, I believe that Linkin Park are better than this band.<br />I'm sure many will disagree, but if you enjoy music that doesn't just use a head banging beat and catchy chorus to gain a fanbase... I do not believe you should pay attention to this band.<br />Overall, though, they aren't terrible, I just believe that they have gotten very over rated.
B000096I9G|5.0|And an update...<br />MTV reports that \\"Seminal goth-pop band the Cure will re-release their first five albums with lots of bonus material in May. Three Imaginary Boys (1979), Boys Don't Cry (1980), Seventeen Seconds (1980), Faith (1981) and Pornography (1982) have all been digitally remastered, and none of the expanded tracks will duplicate songs from their recently released box set, Join the Dots: B-sides and Rarities, 1978-2001. Additional Cure reissues will be released later in the year.\\"<br />I've been waiting forever.<br />Inside the case, it lists that the albums Pornography, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, Disintegration and Bloodflowers will all be remastered and rereleased in 2004. Since this represents parts of 1982-2000, I can only assume that they are planning a MASSIVE rerelease of absolutely everything in The Cure's back catalog. They were on Elektra in the states...Could that mean that Rhino is doing the reissues? If so, I'm imagining that they will give each album the double disc treatment (as they did with Elvis Costello) and include EVERYTHING!! Here's to hoping for good things in 2004! B-Sides B-Sides B-Sides (and finally a complete Kiss Me with Hey You!)!!
B00009RDG9|5.0|Who cares about the critics?They dont speak for the movie viewer. Im going to keep this as simple as possible, this movie IS AWESOME. Director William Friedkin gives us this film about the clash between teacher and student in THE HUNTED. What grabs me (other than the film) is the flawless direction of the knife fight scenes which the depict the Phillipine knife fighting art of SAYOC KALI.This is best depiction of the fighting art itself in American Cinema. My hats off to the superb Benicio del Toro and Tommy Lee for pulling off memorable intense, bloody, sharp fighting scenes. I thought it was sort of unique the way Friedkin chose not to put music during the fighting scenes between Aaron Hallum(del Toro) and L.T. (Tommy Lee) for one reason.   <br />1. This is where Hallum was taught how to kill with bare hands and weapons. The forest, nature itself was his classroom and his hunting ground for humans, the sounds of nature make the scenes more realistic,ominous and deadly.<br />Overall, THE HUNTED is a classic William Friedkin brutal slugfest. A Fine tribute to the action genre as well as the Phillipine fighting art.
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book and can't say enough.  Anyone who loves history and solving puzzles is in for a treat!
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil was such a cool movie.  The DVD come out July 29th.  Everybody buy it!  I saw it in theatres and it was one of the best comic book movies I ever saw.  So, buy it!
0316666343|4.0|This book was very good, but not for the faint of heart.  I lent the book to a friend and she was very disturbed by its nature.
B0000640SA|1.0|This movie just plain stinks.  No, you don't have to be an intelect to follow the story line.  You simply must be from Pluto to understand why the heck someone would go through all this trouble to make a movie this bad.  And when that moment comes and you finally get the point and understand how the timeline works and figure out what in the world is going on and you know the plot, you are left with only one single solitary clear thought - who cares.  I tried to watch this movie twice, neither time did I make it to the end.
B000099T2L|5.0|For those who have been waiting for this album to drop you need to go get it soon as you can. She's not only sexy she also have what it takes to be the young diva she is. If this album isn't a classic the next one will be.
B000099T2L|4.0|Here it is, the album we've all been waiting for. Hopefully this review will answer all your questions.<br />1. Is Beyoncé's album the best out of the 3 Destiny's Child members solo projects?<BR>YES<br />2. Is the sound of the album like any other previous DC stuff?<BR>Basically... NO<br />3. Is Beyoncé's solo version of \\"Dangerously In Love\\" (\\"Dangerously In Love 2\\") better than the DC version?<BR>In a word... NO<br />The Breakdown:<br />1. Crazy In Love feat. Jay-Z - 5/5<BR>We all love this song, it's on the radio, it's got trumpets and an old school Hip Hop vibe, the chemistry (in and out of the studio) with Jay-Z is great, we love it.<br />2. Naughty Girl 4/5<BR>A sexy midtempo Middle Eastern inspired track. A little reminiscent of \\"Kama Sutra\\" by Ruff Endz.<br />3. Baby Boy feat. Sean Paul - 3/5<BR>I'm not really feeling this one. Why does every R&B female (Beyoncé, Blu Cantrell [Breathe], Mya [Things Come And Go] off her new album \\"Moodring\\" coming out this July) feel the need to have Sean Paul on their album? What is he, the new black or something? This could be a popular radio/club song though, it just sounds like any R&B chick could've sung it.<br />4. Hip Hop Star feat.Big Boi and Big Boi and Sleepy Brown - 2/5<BR>I'm really not feeling this one either. I like the edgy rock vibe it has to it but like the previous track it doesn't showcase Beyoncé's writing skills and I'm feeling no chemistry between her and Big Boi.<br />5. Be With You - 6/5<BR>A sexy midtempo groove, the best song on the album, singlewothy.<br />6. Me Myself And I - 6/5<BR>It has the same vibe as the previous song but a little more inspirational.<br />7. Yes - 5/5<BR>Finally an, R&B song that deals with a new situation! I Won't give it away though.<br />8. Signs feat. Missy Elliott - 4/5<BR>A point off for weirdness and that part where they rewind the song, why was that needed? The song was perfect the way it was.<br />9. Speechless - 4.5/5<BR>Soulful, sexy, and midtempo.<br />10. That's How You Like It feat. Jay-Z - 4/5<BR>Nice, but it's no \\"Crazy In Love\\".<br />11. The Closer I Get To You feat. Luther Vandross 4.5/5<BR>We all know this song, a great duet, that gets faded out too early.<br />12. Dangerously In Love 2 - 3.5/5<BR>Okay, but it can't touch the original, there's a slight change in music and the vocals are resung but it lacks the beauty of the first one. I know that this song is close to Beyoncé's heart and she wanted to include it but she should have redone it accoustically and added that great ending she added to it on Saturday Night Live.<br />13. Beyoncé Interlude - (not rated or averaged)<BR>Beyoncé talking about some stuff.<br />14. Gift From Virgo - 4.5/5<BR>A beautiful song that's way too short.<br />15. Daddy (bonus track) - 5/5<BR>A touching beautiful song Beyoncé dedicates to her father. She should write a song about her Mama too for making all them clothes. :)<br />Well that's it. No \\"Work It Out\\" or \\"Can't Take It No More\\" as bonus tracks like alot of people thought. <br />Here's the final averaged grade: 4.357 <BR>That rounds out to 4
B00009V7T2|5.0|Being a big At the Drive-In fan, I was skeptical whether or not that 2/5 of the band could still create incredible music, but they have pulled it off nicely. Singer Cedric Bixler and guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez are the brain children behind The Mars Volta. A band that combines similar intensity to their previous band At The Drive-In but with a progressive kick. Influenced by many different genres of music including, blues, jazz, rock(progressive), salsa and more. This concept album begins simply enough with a keyboard intro into Inertiatic ESP, a progressive rock song that features the hard ATDI feel that so many people have grown to love. Not one song on this album feels the same as the previous track. All are quite different and equally amazing. There is even an amazing acoustic track, Televators, in which our story begins to end. This is a musically and lyrically incredible album from a band that hopefully will be around for years to come. The Mars Volta has the talent and capability to be around for years to come. Buy this album today. It is destined to at least become a cult classic. The Mars Volta has just revolutionized rock as we know it.

0780020685|4.0|Seven Samuri is a great movie, but it shows it's age.  Classic but not really standing well against time.  The action scenes are good if you don't pay attention to the details in what seems to be a lack of skill for these Samurai.  Many things are taken for granted and not explored, such as the skill of the Samurai and the plight of the farmers.  I am a modern movie goer and in an attempt to see where the movies of today were spawned from, I watched this movie.  I was disappointed on some levels, but impressed on others.  It isn't what you think, but it still gives you something you didn't think you would find.  If you think you can sit through a three and half hour movie that does not concern itself much with pace, you should watch it.
B00000055E|5.0|What you hear on the radio today isn't rap; it's pop.  Stupid junk that people throw together and put a bad beat on so 14-year-old girls can jump around and sing along with their \\"i'm so cool i have liquor\\" attitude and much-too-much-make-up!  Now, R U still down is a TIIIGHT CD that really shows old-school rap.  Although made in 97, it brings out some old-school flavour.  Listen to the CD during the day.  Nothing, you don't feel it.  Listen to it on a starry or stormy night driving home by youself and the CD automatically has new meaning and you feel Pac's meaning, you relate to the music.  I 100% recommend this, and wish people would buy awsome CDs like this one as apposed to blasting crap they hear on rap radio stations with ebonic accents so stupid you can't understand them talk about the weather.  Old rap 4 ever! This CD has turned my rap-hating-friends into rap fans of Tupac!! 100% recommended!!
B00005JLPK|1.0|IT IS VERY SAD TO SEE A MOVIE THAT DOES NOT BEGIN TO SHOW FRIDA KAHLO'S REAL INTENSITY. IT IS ALSO RIDICULOUS HOW A CREW AND CAST OF ACTOR WHO ARE MOST OF THEM SPANISH SPEAKING, MADE AN ENGLISH MOVIE WITH SPANISH ACCENT. IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. THIS MOVIE IS JUST A SHOWCASE FOR SALMA HAYEK AND HOW SHE LOOKS IN A COLORFUL BACKGROUND.
0064471837|5.0|wow this was my favorite out of this one and lirael. i haven't read the abhoresen but i cna't wait to read it. this book was spellbounding i loved. Before i actually got the book i had seen it in a bookstore previously and a person who worked there recommened it. i looked at and then read the back and was like yeah i'll read it but then later i decieded not to buy it. that was a big mistake becuz i had to wait forever to get it again. Dont pass it up! read it i loved it!!!
B00005S6K8|1.0|I must ask what the crew was thinking when they decided to remake a classic.  Honestly, how can you ever try to redo a film as great as the original Sabrina?  It is nearly impossible.  This version has such a horrible actess portraying Sabrina.  It is an insult to Audrey Hepburn!  To have someone that can't act and isn't at all attractive play a role you once played?  The horror!  I just can't believe they actually remade such a masterpiece.
B000060OFT|5.0|Alright. This movie receives a lot of mixed reviews, I've noticed. Rightly so, I think it's rather controversial, really. Nonetheless, it's among my favorite films of all time. It reeks of the contemporary, and yet manages to mask it's scent with dazzling visuals and stunning performances. DiCaprio's performance as Romeo takes the cake, as far as I'm concerned. Danes is an effective Juliet, convincing even, but DiCaprio and Perrineau as Mercutio are by far the best performances in the film. Perrineau portrays Mercutio's manic personality to near perfection. And while DiCaprio is almost too pasionate in his own role, it fits under the circumstances. His melodrama and frenetic behavior are what would be expected when thinking of a boy as young as Romeo was, and as allegedly in love. My favorite scene in this film is shortly after our two central characters &quot;meet.&quot; It takes place while they are frolicking around the Capulet's house, if you will, and are embracing and kissing in the elevator, dodging Juliet's mother and suitor, Paris. The chemistry is completely there, every moment of it is believable, and the euphoria that their characters are feeling, is reciprocal between them and the audience. Brilliance.
B00008DDHZ|3.0|It seems that Catholic tragedies are the only events which warrant the attention of filmmakers. The IRA, INLA, Real IRA and Continuity IRA are responsible for bloody monday, tuedsay, wednesday, thursday , friday, bloody Brighton, bloody Enniskillen (11 civilians murdered), bloody Warrington (two little children, ages 12 and 3 murdered), bloody Warrenpoint (18 soldiers), bloody Omagh (29 civilians), bloody Guilford (5 civilians), bloody Birmingham (21 civilians), bloody City (3 civilians including a 15 year old girl),bloody Harrods (five civilians), bloody Claudy (8 civilians)... There isn't enough space for me to list all of them, but the list goes on.<br />  The stastics say it all: In the whole course of the conflict Republican groups have killed far more people (2153) than the security forces (365) and Loyalists (1080) put together. In addition they deliberately target civilians (example: Harrods 1983, Omagh 1998) and have even forced civilians to become suicide bombers for them (Patsy Gillespie, Londonderry 1990).<br />  This film is lacking, not for its portrail of the events of the day which is done quite well, but for what it omits. For example, the very same year (1972) was Bloody Friday (22 IRA bombs murder 9 civilians). No mention is made of any of these other events in the film. Nor, by the way, is there any mention of the fact that the Catholic alienation was due mainly to policies of the Unionist parliament in Stormont and not the British government.<br />  So, in my opinion, see the film, but don't use it as your only source of information about the conflict.
B00005KFUM|5.0|On the dawn of the new album coming out in a couple of months, i will finally have another cd which will constantly be sat in my cd player.  The Origin of Symmetry has lasted well considering the amount of use it has had.  This album is awesome from start to finish but has songs which frankly blitz the high standards.  the tracks that stand out being Bliss, Hyper Music, New Born, and Plug in baby.  My personal favourite is Hyper Music as the guitar riff is so spectacular, you would see any axe player drool over bellamy's effortless talents.  He, you could say, would make most bands famous alone as his talents guitar and piano skills are highly enviable aswell as his marmite like voice.  however with the backing of the talents of chris Wolstenholme and Domonic Howard we have a band of superb musicians.  talking about the album, New Born and Bliss are the typical easygoing starts with powerful guitars coming in gradually, not dissimilar to the masterpieces of Muscle Museum and Sunburn from previous album Showbiz.  Then there is the breathtaking plug in baby.  That is that, this album is  amazing go and by it before the new one comes out, it is not too late!!!
067101756X|1.0|1st let me just say I firmly believe in the Roswell coverup. However, this book was an unbelievable disappointment.I would rate it negative 5 stars if I could!The author is either delusional/insane or purposely spreading disinformation for the government! While on the surface  first things appear good and the author gives many names and has done his homework on Roswell, Tesla, HARP and many other controversial issues..He rapidly discredits himself as taking person credit for just about every signifcant event in history for the last 50 years throughout the book. And I am not talking about Roswell secrets that destroys his credibility. But he claims to be the sole creator of  just about all history in the last 50 years non Roswell as well.   In fact, after reading the book I'm not sure there is a single invention, or political event in history in the last 50 years, legend or Fact Alien, Non Alien, political or otherwise that Corso doesn't personaly take credit for as being his originial idea and using his charisma to change the world. Which is extraodinary considering the fact according to him nobody ever knows he has the Roswell Secrets. So to the government agencies he is a run of the mill Leutinent colonel. In addition to claiming to being the keeper of some Roswell artifacts and sending it out to contractors, He goes on and actually takes credit for personally determining their use , envisioning their future applications and directly the scientists ..all out of his pentagon office out of a 2 door file cabinet.. While I can buy the idea of an office with roswell secret and covertly giving it it to scientists. I cannot buy one man looking through crash scraps in a file cabinet and scribbled notes, and successfully without any lab or real scientists helping him, reverse engineering all the secret artifacts and their alien function  and then  solely himself inventing new technology and applications for EVERYTHING??? PLEASE! It seems we don't have any scientists examining the roswell artifcats to thank for the marvels of the Computer, Laser, Star wars,night vison, thought projection, Stealth bomber, kevlar...It's all Corso's who he himself who comes up with all the ideas and directs the scientists on what to build what he determines..If thats not enough to convince you, he then takes credit for advising the Kennedy's, Hoover and a couple other presidents on many political matters that are totally NOT UFO related,\\" remember nobody knows of his roswell involvement, he is just a paper pusher at the pentagon. Then Corso claims to be soley responsible for giving the idea to Kennedy for putting the man on the moon, personally creating the Cuban Missle crisis by obtaining the photos and leaking them himself, and advising on Italy for the post war european rebuild of the economy. to add to these remarkable acheivements although no one knows he is the Roswell guy, everybody thinks he is some flunky lientent colonel. On several occassions Corco brags about walking in the front door challenging the head of the CIA, the ARPA organization, the Senate, Congress, all about NON-Alien issues!  and winning everytime. It seems Corso can overrun any  anybody organization in the US government..and remember all while nobody knows he is anything more than a lientent colonel..He doesn't even have the weight of the Roswell secrets known to this organization to back him up, Oh yes lets not forget he knows all about the CIA and they know nothing about him, and oh yeah I forgot it wasn't the CIA but Corso himself was also single handliy responsible for identifying the KGB infilitration in the CIA that needed to be cleaned up.Oh yeah Lets not forget his  personal moon base project that got cancelled, How he was at texas when they stored the Alien bodies after the crash and accidently stumbled upon them, how he had the secret Telsa files, has all the details on HARP, the Kenndy assassianation \\"but won't go inot that darkness\\" etc.. the book goes on and on itseems Corso has the answer to every mystery in one book and if that's not enough to swallow  Guess what he was responsible for ALL of it!  Oh yes and he only had the Roswell secrets for 3 years..    This is obviously either authorized disinformation, or an individual fantasy... either way it's a joke and insult to any reader with a below average intelligence or better.. I was serously waiting fro Corso to announce he was secretly God as well. Remember I firmly believe in the Roswell crash it's just this book was so over the top ridculous of tall tales than never end.. I was upset I wasted my time... Corso has got to be the most unreliable Roswell writer ever and his writing is wild BS..who knows maybe the roswell details or others are part true. in the book since he goes so far as to discredit himself with the other BS and we  may have a classic case of crediable information coming from a discredibile source... Either Corso A. was order to produce this...to try and discredit proving the roswell crash, B. he knows nothing about Roswell and is borderline insane. C. He knows something about Roswell and is borderline insane. Either way I wouldn't read this book looking to find anything new on roswell thats even remotely reliable.    If this is the best the government to come up with disinformation recently I have strong confidence we are close proving the Roswell coverup..really Corso and his book are a joke!    I've read and researched almost every UFO book publication out there.. Fianlly somebody with the guts to leak the truth! trouble is after reading the book I had to question what truth was in there at all.. Don't get me wrong I believe there was a crash at roswell and the governement is or trying to reverse the technology.. After reading the book I just don't believe either Corsovo really knows anything and is wildly self delusional or if he does know something he is just trying to spread disinformation. Why? first of all his boasting about everything aside fromUFO's CIA, Generals etc.. throw up a big BS meter. Secondly in additon to having the files, he also accidently saw the bodies back in 47 not authorized just accidently stumbled on them in an unguared warehouse while strolling around a base as a sargent..rather convinent no? then although he doesn't say how, but he knows all the secrets of HARP, bermuda triangle, BigFoot, the tooth fairy..etc... the list goes on and on... then in a final insult to your intelligence he single handedly claims to have reverse engineered and come up with a modern day use for every alien artifact.. rather good for a non- engineer looking at alien artifact in a file cabinent wouldn't you say? In fact by the end of the book in non UFO related topics, Corsovo ends up claiming to also have made several history changing decisons for several presidents, bullied the CIA, knows the secret to every myth and bedtime story, is single handled responsible for every piece of modern technology we have after 1950.. laser, computer, satellite, space shuttle, satellite, internet, etc..  One of these things I could buy but him being the sole originator of all of them? Presidents, CIA, Roswell,computers, laser, HARP.. and all but accident? Not by promotion or assignment.. and not given any real support or black ops project to help him carry them out?? him all by himself in a pentgon office with a file cabinet and his own brains? And then never given any credit? no promotion? for all secrets and influnce in the hisptry of man? why wasn't he made a general or head of the CIA?? just an adjunct coronel?? retired with that pay?? In fact, the BS is so bad across the board I have trouble even beliving this is government disinformation.. they have a history of screwups but even this level of BS fairy tale across the board is beyond them.. My personal belief is that Corsovo is old and self delusional...Save your money and buy a Roswell book from Stanton Friedman he at least tries to come up with a plausible truth andevidence about the Roswell crash adn government coverup
B00005JKN9|5.0|the story is very interesting, and learns us a lot about NY history. The actors acts very well, particularly Cameron Diaz, she's very stunning. It's not boring but sometimes it's a little bit too violent.<br />I very enjoyed it, buy it and the book too !!!!
B000069AUI|3.0|This album is terrible. Its not interesting, its just a somewhat poppier version of thier first album.  Poppier, but not catchy at all.  I hope that this album doesn't indicate whats to come from coldplay. Really, the first album is much better.
0679720200|4.0|the story is interesting, but it sometimes boring.<BR>it's about the absurdity of the life.<BR>read it in french , it's better.
1587990717|5.0|An witty, easy read for financiers and mathematicians, as well as the uninitiated.  Taleb turns the world on its head, or at least markets, in that we do not take account for the rare events - the so called black swans.  It is up to the reader to figure out how to benefit from the brilliant insights.
B000062Y98|5.0|Although this isn't as heavy as their others, it is more technical, and orcistrated - so if you are into progressive, (or of course power metal) you can't go wrong with this. People trash it for being less metal, and more operatic - but that doesn't mean it's not metal. I personally think this is one of the most classic CDs - and one of their best ... maybe some don't agree, but you can't deny it's greatness ... buy it.
0060278250|4.0|Garth Nix began this delightful series with Sabriel, followed by Lirael, and now finishes with Abhorsen. Finishing the story started in Lirael, Abhorsen highlights the journey of Abhorsen/Necromancer Lirael, Prince Sameth, Lirael's trusty dog, and the mysterious free-magic creature Mogget as they travel to battle the evil necromancer Hedge and his army of undead and prevent them from unleashing an evil the world hasn't seen in billions of years. The story begins slowly, but then shoots off. However, right at an exciting moment in the story, it changes tack and we begin hearing more about a different character. While supposedly a \\"good hook\\" to make you keep reading, I found these swift changes irritating, and I was hard pressed not to just skip ahead. Nix went into deep detail with some rather unimportant things, but neglected to explain some key events in enough detail to understand it. The story was rather flawed at points, seeming as if Nix had tired of writing the story and wanted to hurry up and finish it. However, while not as good as it's prequels, I found Lirael a worthy read and would highly recommend it to a fan of the series or of good fantasy.
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown is by far one of the best films ever made. Jacl Nicholson's character, Jack Gittes,is one of the most memorable characters ever to come out in film. The film is great and the Roman Pulanski does a magnifecent job of capturing 1937 L.A. The films Noir style is amazing and the characters and story are so full of believability you would think this is a documentery.<BR>   I think everyone who enjoys movies should purchase this DVD. It is by far the most amazing movie I have ever seen
B00005JKZV|5.0|I think it isn't necessary to add anything more about the movie itself. It's great, we all know that. The question is: is it worth it to buy this edition? Because there will be the extended edition, coming out in November. <BR>This is money talking. It's obvious that the idea is to get you to buy both editions. You're craving for this movie!! You've been waiting for it since it left the theatres, and you'll be out there, in the 26th of August, first thing in the morning, to get it. But then, when the extended edition comes out, you'll want to get it too, because it has all those extra scenes and features. What to do?<BR>I think that if you really liked the movie but don't want to spend a lot of money, it's better to rent it and then buy the extended edition. But note that in the \\"Fellowship\\" the extra scenes didn't really add anything to the movie. Excluding the hobbit's presentation, it was more a promotion of the beautiful New Zealand landscape. I'm hoping that, in \\"The Two Towers\\", the extra scenes will add more to the battle of Helm's Deep, or some new facts that weren't visualised in the theatre version. <BR>On the other hand, once you watch the extended version, that's it. The normal version is perfect if you want to review the movie, simply because it's shorter. <BR>In conclusion, if you're a hard-core fan and can afford it, buy both versions. But, having to choose, I would go for the extended edition, since you can always rent the normal version.
B00008G9JM|5.0|I bought A Passion Play on vinyl as soon as it was available in '73, having been blown away and forever hooked on Tull by Aqualung and Thick as a Brick the previous year.  Either you like it or you don't.  It's not your cup of tea if you are happy with the short top 40 stuff, but if you want to breathe deeply and take in every nuance of the music, then this is the good stuff! Darker and more spiritual than Thick as a Brick, while it will never surpass the former among my Tull favorites, it will always occupy the niche right below it.  This album will define you as a '70s rocker.  If you appreciate this, you either lived through the '70s or would have been at home there.  I played it over and over dozens of times after buying it, just to understand it.  Recommendation: If you haven't listened all the way through, allow a weekend and at least a case of beer (put your car keys away).
B00008G9JO|5.0|I think that some of the one star reviews here are written by the same person who obviously must be a &quot;heavy&quot; &quot;Heavy-Horses&quot;-hater. So, I simply had to write this review just to get the average rating for this masterpiece higher...
020530902X|5.0|Believe it or not, it's all here in this little gem of a book.  It teaches about the power of little words and being concise, concrete, and effective in your writing.  The writers of intelectual tomes would do themselves a favor if they would read the rules and the magnificent advice &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; has to offer.  Stephen King included.<br />If asked to sum it up, I would have to bow my head to the old Chinese adage about writing, &quot;Two words are better than four, and one word is better than two.&quot;  I'm sure you catch my drift.
B00005OW5V|4.0|Just when the critics thought Heep was gone ( the album \\"Conquest\\" was proof ), BAM they're back ! A new Heep came through in the early 80's with this album . They took a modern sound and combined it with the classic Heep sound ! Songs like \\"That's The Way That It Is \\" and \\" Chasing Shadows\\" propelled the new Heep back into radio and ( believe it or not ) MTV ! Buy it , enjoy it and crank it up !
B00005YXZH|5.0|Let me start by saying that I like Wilco....a lot.  As a person who loves music that mostly comes from the UK, Wilco is probably the best &quot;rock&quot; band right now (and probably has been for quite some time).  Jeff Tweedy's words read like poetry that sometimes is difficult to interpret but yet he leaves you feeling that you understand anyway.  When I first listened to YHF, I will admit that I didn't &quot;get it&quot; right away.  It took some time.  I just saw Wilco live for the first time last night and now I understand YHF more (or at least I think I do).  They did a lot of songs from YHF and it was phenomenal!  Maybe I needed to hear some of YHF in a live setting (which sounds pretty much like the album itself).  YHF is not a really easy listen but give it time and you may get a lot out of it.  I know I did. <BR>Wilco seems to be a band who just want to write and play.  They come across as being unpretentious, earnest and genuine.  Why they aren't more poular, I'll never know.  Summerteeth and YHF are probably the best albums, bar none, released in the past 10 years.  Yes, they're that good.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I seriously dont know where to begin, words simply cant express how freaking awesome this band is.  Every single track on this album is amazing, every single one! Tracks like Interiatic esp, drunkship of lanterns, eriatarka, roulette dares, and take the veil cerpin taxt send chills up your spine and detonate explosions of raw energy that is the same raw energy The Mars Volta emmits live. This is a sign of hope for true lovers of music.  It is a sign that The Mars Volta will not give into the pop culture norm, they will not be like their at the drive-in counter parts and play \\"catchy\\" emo music. They are beyond a  musical genre. They are on a whole other plane of musical existence. De-loused in the Comatorium is an amazing musical experience.  <BR>\\"Will you take my dying for granted now that i'm awake. They keep calling through the crawling underneath my skin my chalk outline will stalk these grounds... <BR>just as they have stalked me\\" - Cerpin Taxt.
0393317552|4.0|While accurate, the theories presented in this book is nothing new. Perhaps the first time published, though.<br />Nevertheless, it is still factual and a recommended read.<br />If you want something that will really knock your socks off go online and search for William James Sidis' &quot;The Tribes and States&quot; (unpublished). You'll get a lot of the same as in GG&amp;S, along with political and historical content.
B000099T2L|4.0|I've never been a Destiny's Child fan, and I got the cd because of the &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; single. So I had some reservations about this purchase in the beginning. But upon listening to it, all I can say now is......WOW ! This is off the chain. It's one of those rare cds that you buy where just about every song is good. I particularly like &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; duet she does with Luther Vandross. This is definetely a classic remake of the Roberta Flack/ Donnie Hathaway original version, which is hard to top I might add. This seems to be mainly a cd of mostly ballads and Beyonce pulls it off very well. In keeping this review short and sweet, I recommend this purchase. You won't be dissapointed
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the most intelligently written, fun books that I have read in recent times.  I could not put it down!  There were absolutely remarkable twists and turns.  The history, use of anagrams, mystery, and religious symbology were fascinating.  Dan Brown, you have found a fan!

0531002535|4.0|As a fairly unfamiliar person when it comes to Catholism I found this story most interesting and very well written. The flow from chapter to chapter was smooth. The story kept me interested enough to &quot;read an extra chapter before retiring&quot;, for example. I could put it down, but waited with anticipation to start reading again. Hulme did a good job, to say the least, and I think the editor did do. As a prior member of our Armed Forces I found the discipline of the Sisters' admirable. As a Christian I know there is nothing I can do to earn God's amazing grace. Which is what the book is about in large part: how can Sister Luke justify herself to God? Well, she can't; but no one can! That's why Jesus came into the world.
B000099T2L|3.0|For a first debut solo album, this is not a bad start at all.  I had to listen to it twice, to really start to enjoy some of the songs. Out of the 13 tracks (14 if you count interlude) I liked about 60% of it, making that 8 songs.  My favorites were 'Crazy In Love', 'Naughty Girl', and 'Signs'.  They all had great beats, and in 'Signs' Beyonce kinda sounds like Aaliyah. The featured artists really make this cd better, artists like Jay-Z and Sean Paul made the tracks sound awesome.<br />A few things I disliked was the fact that 50% of the tracks were slow tunes, some of them were good, but I really like the more upbeat tracks.  Also the track 'Dangerously in Love 2' is an exact re-play of the 'Dangerously in Love' off the Destiny's Child 'Survivor' album; I thought that was weak, it should have been at least a remix.  <br />All in all if you are a Destiny's Child fan, or just a R&B fan you will most likely enjoy this album.  After listening to it a second time I enjoyed it more.  But since I really only like about 60% of the cd I have to give it a 3.
6301404440|5.0|Cartoons coexisting with humans! Pretty cool to me. This movie made me laugh a lot. I saw all my favorite cartoon characters such as Dumbo, Bugs Buny, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Mickey, and Porky etc. It is a about a rabbit named Roger who is accused of murder. With the help of Eddie Valiant(Bob Hoskins) the murder case will be solved. This movie may be a little dark with the whole murder thing but it is a comedy I will never forget. Roger and Roger's wife Jessica made me laugh the most. If u want to see your favorite cartoons together or if u like mystery then I recommend this for u.

6302518393|4.0|I got this movie for Christmas back when I was 7 and fell in love with this movie. Now I am 14 and I stil love this movie. It is about this St. Bernard named Beethoven who finds a home. The kids and mother like Beethoven but the father doesn't. It also involves an evil veterinarian that kidnaps dogs and then does illegal experimentations on them. It may be a little dark for younger kids but it is heartwarming and funny. I think Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt did an excellent job with their roles as parents of 3 children. I wish I had a St. Bernard like Beethoven even though he drools and makes a mess in the house. I would recommend this movie to anybody. see it!!! and buy it!!!
B00005JMFR|5.0|I have seen Reloded manytimes and have my own theories. I dont think they are living inj a chain matrix, as its a common imagination, and would ruin the plot. We have to understand that machines dont have a sensory system like us, that even their vision is defined in a machine language. Thus the mind of the machine itself may be somehow connected to the matrix, which means when Neos physical form is sensored, its decoded to his residual self image within the mind of the machine, resulting in the anamoly. The sight of Neo and his actions in real world is decoded into the machine brain, and is converted into his residual self image inside the Sentinnels brain, and since Neos residual self image is an anamoly, it can crash the sentinnels, even if it means that Neo lacks any direct power in the real world? get it? <BR>Thats one Theory. the other is, the machines do not want to kill the anamoly, since the failure to get him into the source will result in a cataclysmic crash killing everyone plugged into the matrix. Eventhough the archetech didnt panic when neo went through the other door, the machines may not be prepared to take steps in the event all crops died. The test subjects died in the first two matrixes, but I believe that it was at a smaller scale and didnt involve billions of crops. If humans are extinct , machines may not have asn alternative energy source, and because of this, the higher order machines probably triggered some kind of a suicidal emp in those squiddys to deactivate them before they destroyed Neo, in which case it was a mere coincidence.  Enter the Matrix game has revealed the reason why Neo is in a coma. His mind is now seperated form the body and is in the source. The Squiddys somehow found a way to get his  mind seperated, and be loaded into the source. So is Smith, as we know he fell into a similar coma. Thats why Neo will confront smith in the source in revolutions, in my opinion.
B000092ZYX|4.0|It's really impossible not to like at least something on this album, even if one dislikes the direction they went in after OK Computer, when they began focusing on increasingly complicated electronic ornamentation. It isn't as cohesive a collection as Kid A, but they seem to be exploring all sides of what makes them such a great band: half of the songs on the album are jaw-droppers (We Suck Young Blood, I Will, and Wolf at the Door, to name a few) and nothing else will make you get up and have to skip a track, like Hunting Bears or Treefingers, indicating that the band has finally realized that tuneless instrumentals are never going to he listened to more than a few times by even the most ardent fan. I also think this is there most human collection of lyrics since The Bends: excessive political engagement is dangerous for any band, and anyone getting in the business of writing polemics will become irrelevant quickly, or their songs will just be puzzling within a few years - see for example a lot of late Clash. Anyway, the lyrics here show Thom dealing with more immediate and pressing concerns than the sorry state of the world, which needs more help than even the greatest album can provide. Worth your money, if you don't have it already.

B000000OSG|5.0|I wish I could give this album more than 5 stars. Use your ilusion II perfectly combines the youthful angst and decadence of appetite with a more mature, artisitc flavour. I think this album surpassed appetite for destruction. The complexity and depth of the music far surpasses Appetite. \\"Estranged\\" is the best Guns N Roses song ever made. My World is definitely the weak link. There's no real pointto the song but its atthe end of the album and its short, so no worries.

0151006903|3.0|I was a little apprehensive to begin Baudolino after having endured the disaster that is The Island of the Day Before, because I feared that Eco had decided to take his writing down a self indulgent road.  Fortunately, Baudolino is better than its predecessor.  Yet, while there is much to admire, its power as a story is undercut by some of the same flaws that crippled Eco's previous book.<br />One of the key strengths of Baudolino is the tremendous amount of historical detail which Eco has placed within its pages. He is one of the very few authors who can portray an encyclopedic knowledge of medieval practices, politics, and people in an entertaining manner.  Yet, Eco shows that he is not just an author who needs a historical basis to build a story.  His efforts into fantasy, as depicted during the title character's quest for Prester John, are as imaginative as those created by any other fantasy writer.  As a result of these efforts, the reader can easily imagine themselves in the world which Eco has created for this story.<br />Ironically, the book's primary weakness is inextricably tied to its strength.  Just like The Island of the Day Before, this weakness lies with an inadequate main character.  Unlike that earlier work's bland main character, Baudolino's title character is very well defined.  Unfortunately, that definition includes the denouement at the book's beginning that he is a self professed liar.  As a result of this confession, I kept wondering if what I was reading was a lie or the truth.  The confusion I felt was not appeased by the book's other characters.  Where the title character was sharply described, the supporting characters displayed very little personality.  The lack of insight provided by these other characters only served to feed the confusion that I was feeling about the story.  In the end, I grew tired trying to resolve the uncertainty I had about the veracity of Baudolino's tale.  Only when the book abandoned all pretense of being historical and delved strictly into fantasy did I find it to be enjoyable.  However, that point didn't occur until almost two-thirds of the way into the book.<br />There is much to recommend in Baudolino.  An intelligent story, witty dialogue, and a well-defined main character are strong points to the work.  But, by prominently displaying the main character's flaw, Eco undermined the power of his story.  Because of this action, many will find Baudolino to be an exercise in tedium instead of a soaring triumph of imagination.
038572179X|5.0|Love and Redemption are tried and true subjects for novels. However Ian McEwan's Atonement tells the story in an original, gripping manner. This book will get inside your head, and during the periods that you are forced to put it down, it will dredge up those times in your life that you made a mistake, and tried to make things right. Of course we can't make everything right all the time. Some things we can't ever fix--and here we are, with material for a novel. McEwan brings us characters in a disfunctional family in pre-war England. A big, terrible mistake by a naive young female family member changes everyone's lives, mostly for the worse. Years pass and the girl grows up and realizes just how big a mistake she has made, and sets out to make things right. This turns out to be dreadfully difficult. World War II has started. The rest of the family has their own problems. <br />The end holds a surprise; it is delightful. Can hearts, lives, and people that have been broken be made whole again? Once a huge mistake has been made, does honesty, sincerity and truthfullness win the day? Or can our actions haunt us with unreconciled acts and estrangement. McEwan gives us hints. The judgement is ours.<br />This is one of the best books of the last few years. If you like excellent, compelling writing, it will stick in your mind for a while after you're done.
B000089RVX|2.0|... but I've heard better!  The songs, while rocking and quite good, do just sound like variations on one theme.  I love &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; as a track, but having heard all the versions of it possible (with the &quot;rap&quot;, without the &quot;rap&quot;, accoustic, live, etc) I have to say that the song is only as good as it is because of Paul McCoy of 12 Stones.  That's a REALLY good album.  <br />Seriously, give 12 Stones a listen and I guarantee you'll agree with me on which Wind-Up band has more talent.  I'm not saying Evanescence are bad, the album's quite good for a first go, but as someone who has been reviewing CDs for some time and is themselves a musician, I can say this is not as good as it's hyped up to be.  It IS the best album of the year... but that isn't really saying a lot!
B000002L99|5.0|Don't get me wrong, \\"1984\\" and \\"Van Halen\\" are classic, and along with the other four Roth-era Van Halen albums they represent the most consistently high-quality body of work of any band I know. But \\"5150\\" just blew me away, and it wasn't solely because of the \\"supergroup\\" image created by hiring a new singer successful in his own right. This was the album where Van Halen really became DIVERSE for the first time. Sure, they had experimented with pop all along, but this was the one that truly had it ALL, from traditional VH power rockers only made better by a new singer (\\"Good Enough\\", \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\", \\"Summer Nights\\"), an ultra-catchy new-wavish first single (\\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\"), great emotional ballads (\\"Dreams\\", \\"Love Walks In\\"), a breakneck speed metal workout (\\"Get Up\\"), a soaring rocker (\\"5150\\"), and the funky experimentation on the autobiographical \\"Inside\\", the only song on the album which really doesn't work. <br />The diversity is what makes this album my favorite Van Halen album of all time, and in fact one of my favorite albums by ANYONE. That and the glossy production by Mick Jones (of Foreigner), who augments Alex Van Halen's traditionally treble-y drum sound (he and Charlie Watts have the most instantly-recognizable drumming in rock) with electronic lower-end drum fills which give the album a beefy sound they've never had before.
B00008H2LE|5.0|With their first CD Linkin Park were hailed as pioneers and they've just blown that out of the water with &quot;Meteora&quot;.  This CD builds on the first and takes what the band have learnt and shared to another level.<br />Meteora is an amazing album and the catchy riffs and thumping bass lines will have you, literally, jumping around your room.  This is another &quot;hit the road at a dangerously high speed and don't look back&quot; type album!<br />The wicked thing is the DVD.  It gives fans a real insight into the world of Linkin Park and the creative process.  It's really interesting to watch.<br />But yeah, the CD rocks, the DVD's cool!  Need I say more?
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes are being hyped as, among other things, the new Stooges, the new Velvet Underground, and \\"the future of rock n' roll\\".  I'm only vaguely familiar with the Stooges and the VU, but I can say that they remind me more of various 80's and 90's garage alternative bands - the Replacements, the Violent Femmes, the Lemonheads, the dB's, Jimmy Eat World, early Cure & R.E.M., etc.  That's not to say they're hopelessly derivative by any means, indeed this album is a breath of fresh air among all the stupid nu metal, rap-rock, teen pop, and hip-hop that inundates us all.    Melodic original tunes (if not terribly original in their style) that you can actually SING to, threadbare production (or at least it's recorded so we THINK it's stripped down), and a cool (if also somewhat hackneyed) image contribute to rock's Next Big Thing.  Can't wait for the new album later this year.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I can't stand how overrated this singer is. It seems that merchandising in music has reached the jazz genre, altough many would argue if this record even qualify as a jazz vocal cd. I am not going to say that Norah Jones is a bad singer, she is better than many prefabricated pop singers, but in no way is she better than contemporary vocal jazz singers like Holly Cole. If you want something new from the regular classics like Fitzgerald or Vaughan you are way better off buying a Holly Cole album. You won't regret it.

B000002U9W|4.0|I recently got this album even though I have been a Floyd's fan for quite a few years already, until I finally decided to get it.<br />I was warned about the title track of this album and while I was listening to it while driving back to my house from the store it did not appeal much to me as something special, but following my old tradition to get ready for albums with many recommendations<br />I got to my room and set all the ingredients for a perfect listen<br />Headphones,lights out, and a quiet environment, no mind altering substances used because I do believe a true good album should be listen with great concentration and maybe a couple of times but no drugs to enjoy it, first track AHT starts nice and the upbeat tune of the beggining sets the mood for a perfect adventure, those duets of Waters bass lines and Ricky's keyboard were truly nice , I was already hook to this song .listen so you will believe ,  I mostly liked  the Guitar parts of Gilmour as it feels so much soul on these guitar melodies, of course this is a lenghty song so abviously expect some parts were you might wonder what direction the guys are going but be patience and you will be rewarded as the last 7 minutes of the song are truly amazing especially that part of the confused- mixed sounds that will lead you back to the original and main melody ,the last guitar solo by gilmour which leads to the end is one of my all times favorites finales on any song by any artist.<br />\\"If\\"  its a laid back,folky song by Waters which is not bad but the same mood is used through the whole song and sometimes you wonder when are they going to take off and rock the lyrics are very nice , Summer of 68 is perhaps the best song of the 3 middle ones as wrights sings about a one night stand , I like the horns in the middle and ending of the song ,Fat Old sun , is another relax song but this time by Gilmour I really enjoy this one and averytime I listen I get into this peaceful feeling flowing along this beautiful slow melody , to my surprise Gilmour did break into a more upbeat part towards the end with a nice ending guitar solo, very nice.<br />And finally the song that according to many its the weakest one of the album, I could understand if some people have trouble putting up with Alan's atmosphere in the kitchen and the realistic sounds while enjoying breakfast in Los Angeles, despite the fact that this another multipart track, I do enjoy it and do not skip to the next or the end, it has some really nice passages during the beggining (especially) and the middle that will lead to a very satisfaying ending with all four guys rocking together to conclude the album with the sounds of waterdrops from a faucet.<br />If like me you are curious about this album and are not sure ,dont wait! if you've liked some other Floyd's material this will not disappoint ! go get it! Atom Heart Mother is a great album and if I did not give it a five start rating its because I'm very picky about giving the max, but this is definitely on my tops of all time albums and I do have a lot of albums!ody , to my surprise Gilmour did break into a more upbeat part towards the end with a nice ending guitar solo, very nice.<BR>And finally the song that according to many its the weakest one of the album, I could understand if some people have trouble putting up with Alan's atmosphere in the kitchen and the realistic sounds while enjoying breakfast in Los Angeles, despite the fact that this another multipart track, I do enjoy it and do not skip to the next or the end, it has some really nice passages during the beggining (especially) and the middle that will lead to a very satisfaying ending with all four guys rocking together to conclude the album with the sounds of waterdrops from a faucet.<BR>If like me you are curious about this album and are not sure ,dont wait! if you've liked some other Floyd's material this will not disappoint ! go get it!

1400034779|4.0|A very simple, easy to understand story about an African lady who becomes the first lady detective in the region. The story starts off a little slow, however, after the first 60 pages or so, it gains pace. Though, it is quite a peaceful read, really. Mma Ramotswe has been depicted as a very strong woman and yet there are instances in her life, when one can sense how weak she must have felt. Especially the time when she loses her baby. The story is set in Africa and it was quite interesting to me, just to imagine how it must be in Africa. (Would sure love to visit Africa sometime!) <br />There is quite a bit of humor in the story, which I didn't expect I would find--- pleasant humor! Obed's character is a very strong one too. Once again, a very simple character. I think the highlight of this story is simply its simplicity. A good read.
B000099T2L|1.0|This c.d. was so dissapointing. I am a big fan of Destiny's child, and bought Kelly Rowland's cd and Michelle's and loved them, but this c.d. was so bad. Crazy in Love sounds like the only decent song to listen to. I tried listening to this cd 3 times, but i can not stand it anymore.
B00005JG6R|5.0|This was simply... The most powerful anime film I've ever seen. Much better than Ninja Scroll or Mononoke! The action scenes were fantastic! One of the best storylines ever, and the plot is great too. <br />This is the story of a biker gang in the distant future of Tokyo. The motorcycle-chase scenes are groundbreaking! One of the bikers gets injured in a gang fight and gets picked up by the Army and experimented with... Project Akira! He then gets these amazing super-powers and... Well, you'll just have to watch the movie. This one is definitely in my top 10 films.
0783892675|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a completely unique novel in that Vonnegut uses his saterical touch to mock the creators and user of weapons of mass destruction.  It damns the scientific community for creating these weapons without thinking of the impact that they have on the world.  The weapons of chioce in this story is an element called Ice-9, which intantly freezes everything it comes in contact with.  When it is used it freezes the entire world slowly.  This novel makes one question the use, creation as well has the wisdom of thse weaons.  But does so with a sarcastic smirk.
B00005YTN5|1.0|This is a terrible reissue of one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  Instead of messing around with why the album itself is good or bad, I will just go right in to why the REISSUE is anything but essential.<br />The reissue starts with the album in stereo.  After that, there are a few NICO solo tracks.  NICO is great, and I love NICO, but her work needs to be appriciated on its own.  This would be like reissuing an album by the Who and adding Pete Townsend solo tracks.<br />After the NICO tracks, the Mono Singles begin.  After the mono singles, the mono album composes the second disc.  Listening to the album in mono is kind of neat, but why put the singles on there if they are already on the album in the mono mix.<br />In the end this is a waste of time and money.  Rather than spend thirty dollars on this pitiful two disc set, I would suggest buying the original version of the album and a NICO album.  This would cost roughly the Same amount of money but more worth the listeners while.
B00008O31H|4.0|In response to whoopy cats assessment that they sound like they listened to the White Stripes and thought it would be cool to kick out the bass player...Dude, there is no bass player in the White Stripes. You will only hear a bass on a few songs that is added in, but there is no bass player that is a part of the band. Learn your stuff before posting garbage like that.<br />This band is amazing for a duo. Don't knock them just because they don't live up to certain people's definition of punk. Yeah, it's much more bluesy, but you can't just call it blues without giving it another rock genre-edge, in this case.
0385504209|5.0|Hi! I thought this was a great book, it was a real eye-opener to those who had yet to learn about the origin of the church and whatnot. The book was very overwhelming for me, it challenged much of what I've been taught, but also opened quite a few doors. I'd recommend this book to anyone. Not only is it full of real information,  but it's fiction and tells of an awesome adventure story. A real page-tuner! Most people might take the time to write in about tiny details about certain paintings that do not allign correctly. I too have a corection to make! The character Robert Langdon claims one of his students came to him bearing The Lion King on DVD. Hardly possible! The Lion King isn't out on DVD yet, silly Dan Brown......
B00005R23S|5.0|i have been purchasing a lot of music dvd's but this one is the best so far. The sound is fantastic, on a good system it's like being there and I love the photography in particular the close ups. I went to see the this band during their &quot;the Rising&quot; tour, an unforgettable experience and this DVD brings it back to my living room. These guys are inspirational, ican't think of any other act that offers a performance more energetic than this, it's all genuine too, these guys are really enjoying themselves.<BR>Bruce is definitely THE BOSS and the E Street band are amazing.<BR>Highlights are Mansion on the Hill, Thunder Road and the final song: If I should Fall Behind, where various members of the band get to sing a part of the song; Clarence Clemons stands out with great saxophone playing and singing. This DVD offers great value as well, 2 discs with lots of songs, well worth buying!!
0156027321|4.0|When first reading this wonderfully modest book, I kept waiting for the appearance of bad writing, sentimentality, or sensationalism: all qualities of many current literary novels. But instead I found a kind of sweetness, despite the awesome presence of Thomas Parker and his desire to devour. Many other writers would have anthropomorphised the tiger, but Martel, smart man that he is, left the animal for what he is...an animal. But none the less relevant to Pi.<br />Pi's constant musings and his ironic and bizarre adventures could have become a Disney JUNGLE BOOK wanna-be. Instead Martel left us the chance to contemplate our own immortality and really come to grips with what might be a version of the meaning of life, after all. Devouring not withstanding, the tiger and his mate kept me connected throughout the entire book. I can almost imagine this being a book to read with the family.
B000099T2L|3.0|In my first review, I gave this cd 5 stars. But now I have to take back two. Why? Because compared to the hype she is getting, this album is not worth it. I really expected Beyonce to expanded R&B and give us a vibe that she gave off on \\"Work It Out\\". Instead, I realize that she compromised too much. As a result, all of the things that she claimed she was going to do with this album didn't not happened. She played it too safe. Plus, after only a few weeks of owning this album I am already sick of it. This is NOT a good sign. She can sing, but she needs to improve on her songwriting, production and stop all the collaborations, which is a sign of insecurity and a desperate attempt to make this album a multi-hit.<br />1. Crazy In Love (Feat. Jay-Z)-she could have done this song w/o Jay-Z, but the beat is hard and is a sample. <BR>2. Naughty Girl-sexy song. There's a sample of Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\".<BR>3. Baby Boy- (Feat. Sean Paul)- a reggae song that will get any party jumping. <BR>4. Hip Hop Star (Feat. Big Boi & Sleepy Brown)- a surprise because its more rock than r&b. <BR>5. Be With You- my favorite song on the album. Slow Jam with beats by two 70 r&b icons.Beyonce didn't come up with these beats.<BR>6. Me, Myself And I- this song features some of her best lyrics. She's talking about relying on herself when a relationship goes wrong. <BR>7. Yes- a C minus song.<BR>8. Signs (Feat. Missy Elliott)- my second favorite song...she talks about all the signs and how they relate to her sign (Virgo). <BR>9. Speechless- Beyonce really blows on this song. She reminds me of the 70's r&b singers on this song. <BR>10. That's How You Like It (Feat. Jay-Z)- another song with Jay-Z. Nothing to talk about.<BR>11. The Closer I Get To You (Duet With Luther Vandross)- no one should touch a classic, but Luther and Beyonce did nicely. Roberta and Donny is still the best,though.<BR>12. Dangerously In Love 2- this song is on DC's Survior album.  She should had put another song in its place. <BR>13. Beyoncé Interlude- she is just talking on this track. Nothing special, but a waste of space.<BR>14. Gift From Virgo-this track is less than 3 minutes, but its lame. Its like she trying to be 70s and hip-hop at the same time. The lyrics starts off nice and ends foolishly.<br />A hidden track is called Daddy. A tribute to her dad and very corny.<BR>An alright debut, but not worth the hype.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|On this cd is some monster sounding songs. Their sound and mixing are excellent. As for some saying that if you have the first two you already heard this, B.S...I always liked the band, but this album keeps my interest a lot longer then they did. However there is a generic Vodoo wannabe at the end, thats not so great. No matter what anyone says the choice is yours. If you like Godsmack you will love this.
6304711875|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time!  It has one of the most memorable scenes and performances in cinema history. The opening scene with Drew Barrymoore!!  This movie never gets old.  It is horror at it's finest.  It redefined the genre and put horror back into mainstream cinema!  I SCREAM with delight over this film!
B000092ZYX|3.0|Very amaturish programming. Just a whole bunch of wish washy songs that would be considered filler if it appeared on a good album. Diehards will give 5 stars for anything radiohead releases so dont trust reviews. It's ashame to see these great artists treading in an area where they are being swallowed whole by groups that have made this type of music for years and years and are so innovative. Radiohead now just follows then, always a few steps (years) behind.
B00005JLEU|5.0|When I first got this movie, my son didn't want to see it because it was about a girl.  He likes action and boy movies.  After we saw the movie with his friend.  He want to see it again the next day.  It's very entertaining and educational like Harry Potter.  We need more of this type of movie.  There are too much non-sense shows on TV.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I appreciated the movie more because of the fact that they didn't rely too much on CG effects (like spiderman). I can feel the actors very well and not those effects. It would be like watching a Pixar movie if they will be all digitalized.

0792163710|5.0|Out of curiosity, I began to draw up a list of similarities between this film and Pale Rider. After a few minutes, I concluded that the basic situation is the same: a stranger appears, becomes involved with the good folks, frees them from oppression by the bad folks, and then rides off. Also,  characters in Pale Rider (1985) have ancestral counterparts in the earlier Shane (1953): Shane/the Preacher, Joe Starrett/  Hull Barret, Joey Starrett/Megan Wheeler, Wilson/Stockburn, and Ryker/Coy LaHood. There are even a few similarities between Marion Starrett and Sarah Wheeler as well as between Chris and Club.  Then I asked myself, \\"So what?\\" Both are classics, each worthy of admiration for its own contributions to one of the most popular film genres, the western. With his film set amidst Wyoming's magnificent Grand Tetons, George Stevens establishes and then carefully develops the core conflict between the homesteaders and a cattleman/land baron, Rufus Ryker. When Ryker is unable to buy them out or drive them off, he hires Jack Wilson to goad them into gun fights they cannot win. Long before the climactic scene in Grafton's bar, we know that Shane must face Wilson. Moreover, Shane realizes that he can never \\"retire\\" from the life that has prepared him for that showdown. (Nor can the character portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider.) Some reviewers of this film have criticized the choice of Alan Ladd to play the lead role, noting his diminutive stature (5'5\\" or thereabouts) and limited acting ability. Obviously Stevens was obliged to use a stand-in for Ladd in a few scenes, notably the great brawl in Grafton's bar. As to Ladd's acting ability, I think it was adequate to the needs of the role he portrayed but the most memorable performance is Jack Palance's as Wilson. His use of body language to communicate menace is unforgettable. I also wish to comment on Van Heflin's often overlooked contributions as he portrayed a decent, loyal, trusting, and caring man. Joe Starrett embodies all of the virtues which -- in combination with a strong back -- must have been required of those who settled in the western territories. I cannot imagine anyone but Heflin in that role nor, for that matter, anyone but Ladd playing Shane.<br />NOTE: The rating is of the film itself; when this DVD is reissued, I hope the supplementary materials are significantly improved.t embodies all of the virtues which -- in combination with a strong back -- must have been required of those who settled in the western territories.

0783225857|5.0|When I ordered this DVD little did I know Gregory Peck would pass away just a week after I received it.<br />I had seen the movie before and read the book - ages ago when I was still in the Philippines.  But I watched it with &quot;new&quot; eyes - after 30+ years of living here in the USA. It is an amazing movie - a real classic - pure &amp; simple with a powerful message. I am glad it wasn't colorized! This is a wonderful, wonderful movie! Peck at his best!  That Oscar was well deserved!  And the bonuses are great too - especially - &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; - the making of TKAM. Go and get yourself a copy of this DVD!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This film deserves all of the praise it receives, especially given the fact that it is derived from a Broadway musical (1973) which was, in turn, derived from two non-musical films, Chicago (1927) and Roxie Hart (1943). I can think of few other works of high quality which have such a heritage. (Can you name five film sequels which are superior to the original?) Crisply directed by Rob Marshall with choreography devised by Bob Fosse, this film operates simultaneously (and seamlessly) on two different levels of narrative: a murder trial which requires the main characters to act and a musical revue which requires them to sing and dance. Thus, the film has a multi-dimensional \\"choreography\\" for which Marshall deserves special credit. Frankly, I was surprised by Gere's performance, especially by his footwork both when dancing and while defending Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger) in the courtroom. In my opinion, he deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. Among the targets of the film's social comments are the role of media in celebrity creation, how an adroit attorney such as Billy Flynn can manipulate the media to his clients' advantage, and how transient celebrity can be. Long ago, I recall my grandmother suggesting that \\"Today's news wraps tomorrow's fish.\\" In all respects, this is a film with Snap! Crackle! and Pop! Here is pure entertainment, worthy of favorable comparison with Singin' in the Rain which remains, nonetheless, my favorite film musical.
B00006F7S4|3.0|I found this album quite disappointing.  I'm a big fan of Beck's prior \\"soft\\" records (\\"One Foot in the Grave\\" and \\"Mutations\\"), but \\"Sea Change\\" lacks the idiosycratic touch that makes those others stand out.  What it provides instead is the only-too-clear portrait of an artist tired of lugging around the \\"Loser\\" baggage, always thought of as the weirdo/slacker prince -- some sort of alternative novelty act, like Weird Al meets Kurt Cobain.  I fully understand the desire to ditch that tag, to expand, to prove himself on the merits -- apart from the (sometimes forced) zaniness that dragged down \\"Midnite Vultures\\" and, at times, \\"Odelay.\\"  However, \\"Sea Change\\" doesn't have a personality to exchange for the one discarded -- there's just a curious void leftover.  Most of the songs on here are decent enough (I'll grant 3 stars for pleasantness), but coming from Beck -- who can and should give so much more -- they sound flat and tired.  In the end, Beck is trying too hard to sound \\"normal,\\" to appear \\"serious\\" and \\"musical,\\" and just ends up sounding like a pale imitation of the folk/blues singers he admires (which is pretty much the definition of 1970's singer/songwriters like James Taylor and Jackson Browne).
B000099T2L|4.0|Although I have never been the biggest Beyonce fan, I will say that I was eagerly anticipating buying this album.  I rushed out to buy it today, and have just recently listened to the album all the way through.  The album opens with the highly publicized single, \\"Crazy in Love,\\" and features guest appearances from Jay-Z, Sean Paul, Big Boi, Missy, and Luther Vandross.  I think the album is a nice edition to music lovers who enjoy catchy  rhythms and fun lyrics.
B00003CXBK|5.0|While Disney is regurgitating the same old formula year afer year and training us for the expected, what are the filmmakers doing over in Japan? They're simply turning out the most creative tales, jawdropping visuals and (especially in Miyazaki's films) the imaginitive UNexpected that animation has ever seen. After growing up spoon-fed with Disney, what I've seen of Miyazaki has effectively hit me over the head with a steel beam.    \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is absolutely an animated epic. I really think that \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (with their epic journeys, warring factions and unknown lands) had a strong influence on this film, and they give you a good idea of the general plot and feel. Then, throw in samurais and a big helping of Japanese myth (which really isn't any more objectionable to western religion than our own Mother Earth myth, if this is a concern for you). Beyond any feel or ingredients list, though, is an awesomely complex and creative storyline, the like of which I've never seen before in an animated film. I believe that this film is so good that it could easily stand being done in live action and could be huge on the scale of a LoTR movie (no joke). Princess Mononoke just \\"happens\\" to be done in animation.    Princess Mononoke really blew me away. I've never been a fan of Japanese animation, but I'm becoming a fan of Miyazaki. The difference is in the story and the creativity. I highly recommend Princess Mononoke to everyone, but especially to the average moviegoer who needs convincing to try it out. The only folks I'd like to warn are those who have a tendency to think or say \\"this is weird\\" 20 minutes into a film and give up on it. You have to have a little bit more of an open mind than Disney would like us to have. You'll be rewarded if you closely follow the film and have that open mind.
0812550706|5.0|I had no clue what this book was. I was searching for another good book that I would really enjoy. I stumbled upon Ender's Game and decided to read the customer reviews because I don't trust the editorial reviews. All of them were excellent reviews so I bought it.<br />I finished Ender's Game in about 7 days. I am a Michael Crichton fan and found this book to be not only fun and exciting with some really good surprises, but it was also an easy read. For that reason is probably why it is a commonly read book for Junior and High School students.<br />Read this! You will not be disappointed...I promise!
B00008X5J1|2.0|Amazon.com reviewers never cease to amaze me.  the worst of the trio is easily Gangs of New York. The plot was inventive but pulled off horribly. Why are Black folk running around NY helping out Irish blokes? Confusing to say the least....I challenge anyone to remember the ending (and care) about what happened to the central characters. I only gave it to stars cuz even tho she's kinda pale Cameron Diaz looks fun....Holla
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is sooo great! Beyonce really proves that she can do it on her own,and nonetheless,even better. This is one of the best debut's that came out all year! This cd reminds me of Destiny's Child's \\"The Writing's On The Wall\\" cd because you can listen to this cd all the way through without skipping a song.I have listened to every song except for \\"Gift From Virgo\\",and so far I am pleased. My Top 5 favorite tracks are:<BR>1.Crazy In Love<BR>2.Naughty Girl<BR>3.Signs<BR>4.Baby Boy<BR>5.Hip Hop Star<BR>Even the bonus track,\\"Daddy\\", is a good song. This cd is a must buy. I give this album a rating of A/A+
B000099T2L|4.0|Working in a music store you can easily get jaded pretty quickly on pop music. In my mind b4 it dropped, I already had an 'idea' of what this disc would sound like....and I'm glad I was wrong for once. Having written 97% of the Destiny's Child hits for the past six years (number one girl group of all time, it's truth, trust that, head to Billboard if ya dont believe me) I respected Ms. Knowles writing ability and her...uhm, physical attributes. The first single is dedicated and featuring her current beau, Sean Carter aka Jay-Z and the beat is FIRE... Baby Boy featuring Sean Paul is one of the tightest reggae meets R &amp; B mixes heard in a while, she actually utilizes S.P.'s unique talents to flow with her vocals equaling a song you wanna play really loud when you need some energy. Hip Hop Star is track 4 and Big Boi (from Outkast) and Dungeon Family crooner Sleepy Brown nail a track of Stanked up funk for 'Yonce LOL. How U Like It is another track featuring...guess who- JIGGA! He rips it tho, as usual. She even has a baby making rendition of the closer I get to you with LUTHER VANDROSS (Hold your head homey). The disc ends on a high note with Dangerously in Love pt. 2 the sequel (?) to a song that was first on Destiny's Child Survivor disc (I Swear, I only know that cuz I work at a music store...would somebody nicknamed Scarface know bout Destiny's Child any other way? I think not) and is a BLAZING track, so slow, so soulful, and so surprising. It's hot. Check it out you wont be dissappointed, and remember I'm not a Destiny's Child fan, but I copped this disc, so should you. Holla...

B00005V3Z4|4.0|has got something going for it. I think the movie hits the literary equivalent of the &quot;personal fallacy,&quot; wherein because something hits someone hard for personal reasons, they tend to rate it higher as &quot;art&quot; than it, perhaps, deserves. Well, I am one of the victims of the fallacy. While flawed, it has some genuinely beautiful moments and captures the strange and dreamlike world of some teenagers perfectly. For all of us who grew up feeling possibly border-line schizophrenic, its weirdness is like--oh, I don't know-- going back in time.
0142004235|1.0|This was one of the most boring books I have ever read.  I felt no empathy for any of the characters and the long, tedious descriptions of the scene were enough to put me to sleep.  I found the characters to be unmotivated and I was indifferent to the three families that are the focus of the book.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This record is amazing. The Mars Volta have managed to push the very boundaries of rock music into a new and exciting place. The musicianship is top notch; Jon Theodore, especially in my opinion, does an amazing job on drums. Flea appears on the record in top form, and Jon Frusciante lends a hand on &quot;Cicatriz Esp&quot;. The vocals are incredible, drawing a striking resemblance to Robert Plant except much more smooth and Natural. The remarkable thing about &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; is its handle on the ethereal ambience, high energy and and intriguingly complex rythms, and beautiful melodies mostly via the vocals. High points of the album include Inertiatic esp, Roulette Dares, Drunkship of Lanterns, Eriatarka, Cicatriz esp, and the beautifully meloncholic ballad Televators. Look for things that At the Drive In could only dream of doing, a blend of purity and complexity, angst and joy. It is truly fresh in terms of the musical monotany of today.
B000002GA8|4.0|This is one fun piece of music. If you are not into 1970s progressive rock, like Yes or King Crimsom or ELP, chances are that you won't like this album, either.  But who knows? Maybe you should give this piece of music a chance, especially if you enjoy classical music. I don't always enjoy fusions of Rock and Classical, but Wakeman makes it work here. His keyboard playing here is, I believe, at an all time peak. Yes, the music does have a 70s feel to it, but if you can get past that, you'll realize that it really is some great music.
0688163173|3.0|Shutter Island is such a major departure from Lehane's previous works that I had a hard time believing he wrote it.  Where is Lehane's Boston and the fabulous characters with which he populates it?  I guess he left them all on the mainland when the ferry departed to psych prison in the outer harbor.<br />Disappointment with Lehane's new approach aside, this was a good, but not great, read.  If you're truly a fan of Lehane's Boston you might want to stay away. If you enjoy psycho-thrillers, you'll likely enjoy this one.

SABRIEL IS A YOUNG WOMAN GOING TO THE OLD KINGDOM FOR THE FIRST TIME TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER FATHER WHO IS TRAPPED IN DEATH.  SHE MATURES BELIVABLEY THROUGHOUT THE BOOK, BATTLING THE DEAD AND SLOWLY FOLLOWING IN LOVE.

B000099T2L|5.0|This cd is amazing. It is good to have Beyonce come out by herdelf and show herr talent off.
B000002U3P|4.0|This is one of the finest soundtracks of the 90s, and in some ways, the music is better than the film it's supposed to represent!<br />With my one gripe out of the way starting now--why a cover of Blondie's \\"Atomic\\" that's so straight as to be original???--most of the tracks could find their way into a dance club at any given moment, or at least, booming out of somebody's convertible.<br />A great cross-section of 70s, 80s, and 90s dance music, but minus one star for releasing an unnecessary second disc when they could have taken the good stuff off of it and extended the length of this one.
B000099T2L|4.0|I was so excited about this album, having heard and loved Crazy in Love and Work it Out (from austin powers 3).  I expected an upbeat, funk-inspired, great-for-summer album, but the album is really very different than those two singles.  It is essentially a very musically eclectic concept album.  Nearly every song on the album is a love song (even the bonus track is about Beyonce's love for her daddy - though it sounds corny here, its a beautiful song).  <BR>Upon my first listen i was disappointed with the album's slow sound, but that was because i brought it to the gym and ultimately realized its not suitable for a workout.  Anyway, after hearing it again, i've decided, with the exception of SIGNS, which i think is just an uncreative, redundant total mess (im disappointed with missy elliott on that one!), the rest of the album is just really good music.  There are one or two up-tempos, but the rest is soulful and resonant (except SIGNS lol), which i expect will give some of the music more longevity.
B00008977N|4.0|After having read the reviews of this dvd I was at first a little worried whether I would be wasting my money buying this dvd. Some of the complaints are justified, such as the grainenees at times in the picture and the lack of bass which has been taken out of the audio mix in several songs, in particular Solsbury Hill. There are however improvements over the original in the audio, in that both guitar and keyboards are given more prominence than before. Some of the vocal parts have also been re-done and sound alot better, particulary on songs like Kiss That Frog and Sledgehammer. The highlight for me however is the audio mix on San Jacinto which blew me away the first time I heard it, as it was the song I would always fast foward on the video. All in all a great dvd well worth buying despite some minor complaints.

B00009V7T2|5.0|I never thought I would be glad that At The Drive-In broke up, but this album reaches new heights the ATDI never could. After listening to it(and the EP), it is clear why they did. Omar and Cedric were looking to push the boundries of music with raw energy, deep emotions, new sounds, and musical experimentation that have never been reached. It comes together in one of the most powerful albums ever recorded that will grab hold of you, shake you around, and have you questioning the very limits of sound.<br />It is obvious that Omar and Cedric were the driving forces behind ATDI that made them so innovative and infectious. Sparta's (the other half of ATDI's band) noble yet much less powerful and groundbreaking album is ATDI without the energy, force, rhythm, and originality that made them great. However, after the Tremulant EP that Mars Volta released I was worried that without the precision and technique of the other members of the band that their experiment might fall flat. They were mixing together many new sounds, but did not seem to have a cohesive idea of what they were trying to accomplish. But, all fears have been put to rest now as The Mars Volta truely has found their way and have put together an unbeleivable musical formula that doesn't seem like it can go wrong.<br />If you have not read up on the album yet, it is a concept album based upon a story written by Cedric about the life of Julio Venegas, a musician and drug abuser who committed suicide in 1996 but always \\"lived life to the fullest\\". It tells of a hero who tries to kill himself by overdosing on morphine only to wind up in a coma. He has fantistic dreams about the good and evil forces in himself and the world battling with each other. He awakens from a coma, but still chooses to die. It is a dark and powerful story that seems impossible to capture in music, but is even more incredible then what one who has not heard it could imagine.<br />It comes off seemlessly with stretches of intense, driving hardcore music; soulful, desperate interludes; deep, thought provoking, and gut-wrenching lyrics; experimental,feverish clips of music dashed in everywhere; incredible guitair solos; and sound fields layered enough to completely blow your mind. It accomplishes what few albums have ever been able to do, to take the listener on a journey to places they have never been before and that they will never forget.
B000099T2L|3.0|I expected so much better coming from Beyonce. I wasn't a big fan of hers at first but I love Crazy in Love cause it remains me so much of situations I've been through. And I'm thinking with all the artists featured on here I would like more songs on here then I do unfortunately I was disappointed but who knows maybe I'll get my 15.00 worth and  the album will grow on me.
0316666343|5.0|This book has truly inspired me to look a life differently.  I am 14 years old and although the book is geared to adults, I have not only read it twice, but I have recommended it to all my friends.  It is truly a page-turner.
6302424887|4.0|Roman Polanski takes on William Shakespeare in an interesting adaptation of the dark and morbid play 'Macbeth'.  The colors, costumes, and scenery seem appropriate for the bleak story.  A few problems though... Lady Macbeth does not seem as stong of a character and the famous speech at the end is weak.  See it if you are a Polanski fan.
0060005424|5.0|LIRAEL IS A DAUGHTER OF THE CLAYR THAT FEELS UTTERABLY ALONE AND NEGLECTED.  SHE IS WITHOUT THE SIGHT AND LOOKS DIFFRENT THAN ANY OTHER DAUGHER.

B00008OWZC|5.0|And it is stunningly exhibited in this 3-disc set.  Led Zeppelin was, first and foremost, a powerful and capable live band.  For people like me who know their live act only from the sub-par \\"The Song Remains The Same,\\" this set wipes the slate clean and reestablishes them as THE rock band of rock's first thirty years.  Jimmy Page utterly burns on guitar.  Robert Plant never sounded better, playing brilliantly off Page and just drippping with sexuality.  John Paul Jones keeps things moving and steady at once with his groovy bass and keyboards, and John Bonham.... whew... he is JOHN F**KIN' BONHAM, and we'll leave it at that.  \\"Dazed And Confused\\" takes you to strange lands, \\"Rock And Roll\\" rocks hard, and \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a jaw-dropping standout track; this is how Wagner would have played the blues.  The most fun track? \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp,\\" Plant's ode to his dog.  You can't call yourself a rock fan if you don't own this set - it IS rock.
B00009V7T2|4.0|I am a long time At the Drive in fan, and when I heard that they were splitting into two factions, I was stunned, yet excited.  Now I would get two bands with the influence of At the Drive in.  Sparta was the first to come out with their CD &quot;Wiretap Scars,&quot; and I thought it was hands down the best album of 2002.  It had some elements of ATDI but was much more melodic, and Jim Ward's voice was so much better than Cedric Bixler's voice ever was in ATDI.  After hearing this album, I couldn't wait to hear what creative turn that The Mars Volta would take with their new album.  I got this album yesterday and I'm sorry to say that it's nothing new.  The Mars Volta kept the two members of ATDI that were crazy.  They decided to keep their music loud and powerful with Cedric wailing at the top of his lungs.  The guitar sounds a little different from the riffs on &quot;Relationship of Command,&quot; and Cedric Bixler sings a lot more on this record, but for the most part, they are a carbon copy of ATDI.  If you liked At the Drive In, I recommend you check out this album.  If you can't stand Cedric Bixler's vocals, check out Sparta.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is probably the best album I've ever purchased.  I love the dynamics of going from soft and dreamy to hard and formidable. Amy Lee has a spine tingling voice that I rank up there with Annie Lennox and Sarah MacLauchlin (sp?)  I crank this up in my car and sing along to the top of my lungs.  I'm a fan from the first note.  Keep them coming.  I will be needing more of this in the future.
B00005OWEG|4.0|First off to the people complaining about the aspect ratio. It was filmed in 2.35 but framed on dvd for 2.0. The reason is because of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. He does not like to letterbox at the full 2.35 (see also Tucker:the man and his dream. Which he also shot for Coppola). Although I don't agree he was the artist so it was his decision along with Coppola. It is still better and you still see more than in full frame pan&scan. My problem is where are the extras. I would have liked the destruction of kurtz compound as a bonus like on the first disc. Where is the making of, or a documentary on the restoration? Where is Coppola with an audio commentary (Busy with the \\"Godfather\\" one I guess). It is still a masterpiece movie and the additional scenes are needed. It makes the film feel more complete. Despite the fact that there are no extras any fan of the movie or classic cinema should get this.
B000059XUO|5.0|No, I'm not kidding.  Yes, I'll stand by what I just wrote.  The Bard himself could've written a dark, tragic story like this.  <br />For the uninitiated:<br />Our story begins with the brutal murder of Eric Draven and the vicious rape of his fiance, Shelly Webster, who later dies after thirty hours of emergency surgery.  Detective Albrecht, the policeman assigned to the case, is determined to solve this crime.  In the distance, the city -- which is never named, by the way -- is burning from multiple fires, as the city's lowlifes celebrate another Devil's Night with rampant destruction and chaos.<br />One year later, Albrecht's been busted down to patrolman for refusing to stop investigating the Draven/Webster case.  Another Devil's Night is fast approaching.  And in the graveyard where Eric and Shelly were buried, a solitary crow lands on Eric's gravestone and taps it with its beak, as if knocking.<br />And Eric Draven lives again.<br />Eric has come back to avenge what happened to Shelly and himself, and now he's got the abilities to do it.  He heals from any injury within seconds.  He can feel the thoughts and sins of others.  Through it all, he's guided to the violent thugs responsible for it all by the same crow that greeted him when he awoke.  Not only that, but we know as much about this crow and what it's done to Eric as he himself does; which is to say, not a lot.  We don't know how this happened.  We don't know how any of it's possible.  We know Eric himself never asked for this, because he's just as mystified by his condition as we are.  <br />The sweeping panoramas of the city itself evoke a feeling of Blade Runner, but whereas Ridley Scott's movie was a neon-drenched postmodern future, this one reflects the urban blight and hopeless decay you'd see in present-day Detroit, Belgrade, or Baghdad.  In fact, this has to be the first color movie filmed in black-and-white I've ever seen.  <br />This movie is magnificent.  It's alternately dark, violent, and amusing by turns.  And Brandon Lee himself is a wonder; he's utterly convincing as an undead avenger equally consumed by rage and drowned by grief.  Neither Macbeth nor Hamlet could hold a candle to the character of Eric Draven, and it's a massive credit to Brandon Lee that he could pack so much into so few lines.  If not for his tragic death on-set, I firmly believe he would've gone on to even bigger and better things.<br />Although, what would've been better than this is hard to imagine.  And I can imagine quite a bit.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok Computer is definately Radiohead's Revolver. This recording is absolutely brilliant, start to finish. I honestly can not think of one bad thing to say about it. It's ethereal, beautiful, elegant and heartfelt. Those are only a few of the many ways one can describe this sui generis outing from one of the most ingenious bands of the 90s. Beginning with the remarkable Airbag, this cd gets started on a startlingly excellent sound that continues throughout the recording. The classic Paranoid Android has a disconcerting, schizophrenic vibe, but at the same time, it's elegant and beautiful. Subterranean Homesick Alien is wispy and removed, evoking standard elements of Radiohead's notable sound. Exit Music For A Film starts off at a troublesome, brooding pace and boils over into an exploding symphony of sound. Let down is a more gentle, fey-voiced song. Next up is the other classic Karma Police. KP is a melancholic Radiohead gem that I absolutely love. The brief but incisive Fitter Happier conjures up memories of 1984 for me. The song is spoken by a frightening robotic voice speaking of unsettling events with a tearful piano tinkling in the backround. Electioneering sounds like the name of the song. Weird and electronic. Climbing Up The Walls is another outstanding Radiohead song. More of the same ineffable Radiohead elements. No Surprises, in my opinion, is probably the third best song on here, behind Paranoid Android and Karma Police. No Surprises is a poignant, gentle ballad that is truely amazing. Lucky is more of the same excellence from Radiohead. The Tourist is a great closer that leaves the listener begging for more. In summation, I'd just like to reaffirm my love for Radiohead's music. Their music is really some of the greatest music ever made. This album in particular is really a classic and I recommend it to everyone.
B00009P1O2|4.0|Queen performed two sold out shows at London's Wembley Stadium in the summer of 1986 on what was to be their final tour. For the first time ever on home video, \\"Live at Wembley Stadium\\" (formerly known as \\"Live at Wembley '86\\") shows the concert in full.<br />Perhaps the finest stadium rock band the world has ever seen, Queen ran through many of their hits and little known gems to an enthusiastic crowd.<br /> The band knew what it took to successfully play major stadiums and give every fan their money's worth. Freddie's up and down the scales duet with the audience, Roger's rollicking drumming, etc, the band was essentially the best there was at the time.<br />It was interesting to see the performances that were edited out of the VHS release, namely the oldies medley. Seeing Freddie running around in a freshly stolen policeman's hat was a sight. Queen had something many rock bands today sorely lack, the ability to have fun.<br />\\"Live at Wembley Stadium\\" is presented in 1.33:1 full frame, which is something of a surprise considering the band decided to matt their previous DVD's to widescreen even though that wasn't their OAR (Original Aspect Ratio.) I'm pleased they're releasing the concert as how it was intended to be seen.<br />Picture quality is, for the most part, quite good, and this is likely the best it has ever looked. There is some pixelation to be found however (certainly noticeable during shots of Roger) but colors are vibrant (Freddie's yellow jacket almost bounces off your screen) and for a 10+ years old concert shot on videotape, the image looks fairly sharp. Outside of Pioneer's \\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"Live at Wembley Stadium\\" is the best looking Queen DVD on the market.<br />On the audio side, the DVD offers DTS 5.1 and PCM stereo tracks to choose from. Since I cannot listen to DTS, I cannot comment on it, but the uncompressed PCM track is wonderful, featuring great fidelity. Forget listening to the CD of this concert from now on, the PCM track bests itin every way.<br />The menus (on both discs) are animated and features soundclips from the show. Thankfully the design has been improved to the point to where the disc doesn't have to be accessed each time you highlight something from the menu (unlike the previous Queen DVD's.)<br />The second disc begins with newly filmed interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor, the band members give a great deal more insight into the two concerts, and with plenty of backstage footage edited in, it has it's own documentary feel to it.<br />Gavin Taylor (who directed the concert) and Gerry Stickells (Queen's longtime tour manager) are also interviewed, and while not as interesting as the band, they give the shows a bit more perspective which I welcomed.<br />\\"A Beautiful Day\\" is a more robust documentary on the Wembley concerts and was directed by \\"The Torpedo Twins.\\" You know what that means right? Footage we've all seen hundreds of times over, yay! Basically, if you've seen \\"The Magic Years\\", you've already seen \\"A Beautiful Day.\\" However, since that doc has been unavailable for years now, there is probably a good number of newer fans who've never seen the footage so perhaps it's not a total loss. There is a lot of interesting stuff in it, lots of backstage stuff, interviews with Elton John, etc, so it's definitely worthwhile if you've never seen the previous docs.<br />A tribute to Wembley Towers is a real waste of time in my book. Instead of seeing the actual tearing down of the stadium, we get a sped up look at crews removing the two small \\"towers\\" outside the stadium with only Brian and Roger narrating.<br />Disc 1 showcases the Saturday night concert at Wembley, but on disc 2 we get the highlights of Friday's show (which ended up being played to a rainsoaked crowd.) While the songs are the same, there are always little differences in how they're performed so it's worth a look.<br />The rehearsals are just that, Queen rehearsing for their massive Wembley gig on a smaller (though identical) stage. The band found this footage in a Queen fan's collection so naturally the audiovisual quality is less than average, in fact it looks like a bootlegged performance.<br />There is also an option to watch Queen using the multi-cam, which is to say you can watch Brian and only Brian performing by himself with no footage of the others (you can do this with Freddie, Roger or John as well if you so desire.) This option is available on four songs; \\"One Vision\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\", and \\"We Are The Champions.\\" As a Roger fan myself, I particularly enjoyed having him fill my screen for an entire song.<br />Rounding out the features is a picture gallery. Nothing terribly exciting here, I've never found this kind of feature interesting anyway.<br />Included in the DVD is a full color booklet filled with some great photos, but I would've liked to see some kind of essay from Queen archivist Greg Brooks to put the show in a historical perspective.<br />Overall, this is the best Queen DVD yet. The entire concert, looking and sounding better than ever (though I wish they'd include a Dolby Digital 5.1 sound mix since many cannot listen to DTS) and a generous helping of supplemental features make \\"Live at Wembley Stadium\\" the DVD to buy for your friends.
B000099T2L|4.0|The product gets four out of 5 stars. At first listen the album felt kinda odd because of its entirely different sound and feel to it but upon a further listen and understanding of where Ms. Knowles is coming from...one can easily see how she put that work in for this CD. The sounds are tight. Especially #1, 6,7,8,11. Grown up...yes. And she wants you to know that. Certain songs reveal a Beyonce the public has not been used to seeing and hearing (Interesting to see how she will demonstate the material of her album this upcoming summer for her tour). Because of the grown up feel to the album, Beyonce strives to reach a newer audience not necessarily DC listeners but falls in between Avant lyrics (freaky songs) and  something else. Right now I don't know how to feel about this direction Ms. Knowles is stepping in. I see a change in the formula they have been known for. We know she is the leading force behind the DC family and if this is where the group is headed we'll have to wait and see what the furture holds for DC3. As for right now, enjoy the hot tracks this album presents and rejoyce in its creative strengths. Beyonce, maybe you're trying to show your real side through your lyics or daring to be different. Either way, you may get the audience you intend to get....hopefully you won't loose the one that's had your back the whole time though...<BR>my 0.02
B000002O51|5.0|In my opinion, Third Stage was the turning point in the sound of Boston's music. While I listened to the album, I noticed some of the songs had the classic Boston theme, while others had similar sound to that in Walk On. Either way, I would recommend that any Boston fan get this album. The sound is so unique compared to other bands and would be a great addition to your CD collection. <br />To all of those who are starting to show interest in Boston, I would recommend you get their debut album Boston.
0140282033|5.0|Though the book appeared a few years ago, and the film version eclipsed it, it does furnish an amusing read, with a modicum of twists and turns and reasonably interesting characterization.  It conveys village life, for most of us an alien concept, and does have dramatic tension as well as character evolution.  It does transport you to a different world, but without extracting a large toll.  Certainly it is better than watching TV or for that matter, most films.
0375432302|5.0|My friends told me that this book was a must-read, and they were not lying. So what if the historical facts are slightly askew according to these other &quot;experts&quot; posting reviews. Who cares? If you want history, get an encyclopedia. For someone who wants an entertaining read with twists and turns, sometimes predictable but often not, buy this book.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|... one of the best soundtracks to come out in a LONG time. That being said, Eminem drops some great songs in \\"Lose Yourself\\" (you've heard it, you love it, what more can I say?) \\"8 Mile\\" (title track, great lyrics about his struggles to get here), \\"Rabbit Run\\" (a look inside the mind of a rapper, haunting piano loops) and his verse on Rap Game (listen for Em doing a bit of his verse in Pig Latin)... Love Me is one of my favorites featuring 50, Obie Trice, and of course Em. Obie drops some good lyrics, Em comes out great, and 50 does a hilarious job of dissing Murder Inc. (again) as well as some people whose names might surprise you. Obie Trice is decent on Adrenaline Rush... not good, not bad, just average. 50 Cent isn't much better on Places to Go... just another average song. 8 Miles & Runnin'... Freeway sucks, but Jay KILLS it here. Jay comes with some of the best lyrics I've heard him spit in a good minute. Definite favorite. Xzibit's Spitshine is average... expected better from the man who gave us \\"What You See Is What You Get\\". Macy Gray... out of place, not worth listening to. Wanksta... not really that good of a song. U Wanna Be Me... proabably the worst song on here. I'm a die-hard Nas fan, but what were you thinking? A mindless dis @ some unnamed people... could have been left off. Rap legend Rakim drops by with R.A.K.I.M... great lyrics by one of the best to ever drop... enough said. Young Zee... filler, but still some pretty funny lyrics. Gangstarr holds it down on Battle... the title is self-explanatory as he shows you he can battle with the best. Overall, a great soundtrack... could have been better, but still impressive nonetheless. Recommended...

It is about a ice-human killing machine who wants to feel.  But unlike other people Todd (Russell) grew up under millitary control that brainwashed him to be nothing more but a killer.  It is hard journey for Todd, he has to become human and in the process he will kick some serious butt.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce's album is very different from Destiny's Child. Her album is risky, yet it works! She is talking about more mature topics. Love--making love---dealing with her boyfriends kids even--lol. You will definetely relate to the songs on this record. Don't go into listening to this album biased, because you may not like Beyonce' personally.

0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is a raw adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. It follows the lifelong journey of an Irish-American mobster named Henry Hill. The movie starts with his childhood, growing up poor and his infatuation with the people that were feared and the people with the power-mobsters. Henry gets a job with the mobsters at the cabstand. His job is basically an apprenticeship with the leader Paulie Later in the film, Hil is all grown up and is a big time mobster. the adult Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta in the performance of his career. Liotta also does the voice overs throughout the movie. You are then introduced to some of his friends played by DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and his wife played by Soprano's star Lorraine Bracco. The great thing about this movie is how real it is. The mob movies that came before only focused on the good parts aboutmob life, but this film focuses on all aspects; the pressure from the hierarchy, the constant running away from the police, the conflict of interest between prison time r ratting out your friends. The film is directed by Martin Scorcese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) and is similar to the other two films in the sense that it is a character study on the rise and fall of a man. This film is truly one for the ages.
055357342X|5.0|I was impressed with the first two books in the series, but this is a whole new level. While Martin succeeded in developing an imaginative world set with conflict and anticipation, I have found that many authors fail when it comes time to go from set up to action (see Robert Jordan). Martin not only succeeds but improves. Jon Snow's character is engrossing.
0783226063|4.0|For once, I had not read the books for Dune and thus have to look at the movie expecting exposition and plot to explain itself.  Well, it doesn't.  The movie is long and intriguing, in fact the more I watch it, the more I want to watch it.  Why?  The bizarre costumes and convoluted story actually make the movie act as a strange narcotic.  <br />So many things are not explained, some can be infered, but much is lost.  Are the Harkonans cannibals?  Are they gay (not meaning to be derogatory-> there are no women), and so on.<br />To be true, when I watched the 3+ hour Japanese Laserdisc (japanese subtitles), much more is explained in the prologue, and the cut scenes.  And the few times the Sci-Fi channel played the uncut TV edition, again more is explained.  <br />Suffice it to say, this does not stand well on it's own.  It is fun and not to be missed, but reading Dune and Dune Messiah are prerequisites for seeing the film.

0671027344|3.0|Many of my friends told me about this book saying that it could not go without reading. I figured I would give it chance because I hadn't heard a bad review. I finished it in one afternoon and have to say that it lacked originality. I failed to find something life altering or any source of self revalation among the pages.<br />I have seen the \\"diary style\\" book many times before, such as \\"Go Ask Alice\\". The themes seemed to be extremely common among teen Stories. For Example, \\"Hi I'm Davey and I'm an alcoholic.\\"<br />In my opinion, it is a book that people who dont exactly read alot can refernce in order to appear that they are avid readers. Although you won't find the book in the young adult section, it is short and has a very vibrant cover in order to appeal to a younger crowd. Another thing I noticed was that it was endorsed by Mtv.<br />Don't get me wrong, I though it was a good book, just not great. I think that if you have the time and enjoy these kind of books you should definatly pick it up at the library. Just don't expect to finish the book with a new sense or a new outlook on life (although it may happen. everyone is different.)
B00006V9A0|5.0|Though I live seven seas away (India) from America, but this music God has my faith undivided.  This album is what I had been waiting for since long.  When the first song gets into your head, you strenghten your belief and thank this God for this bliss.  A recent survey has placed &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; as the most savoured song of recent times.  If only we could have more of this.
0394800389|5.0|Such a funny book, I still enjoy reading it more than 20 years later.  You have to read it out loud, its funnier that way.  Im reading it to my son now and he's enjoying it too.
B00005JLPK|3.0|Frida was a well made movie.  The cinematography was great, the acting was good, everything worked quite well.  What troubled me with this movie was my inability to connect with it.<br />I expected to be drawn into Frida's character and to be able to understand who she is and what her motivations are, but I found the film lacking that explantion of her character.<br />It became apparent to me that in order to fully enjoy this movie, you have to be familiar with the life and circumstances of Frida and you have to identify with her character prior to watching the film.<br />This was my mistake, as I watched the film, knowing little more about Frida than that she was a painter.  To me the film unfolded as a series of events in \\"someone's\\" life.  It was like watching the home videos of a stranger (well, that is overexaggerating quite a bit, but you get the point), it is just a few events in Frida's life that I had no connection with.<br />The one scene I could connect with was the death scene.  I felt more of the movie should have followed the same style as that scene.  While watching that scene, I finally felt involved in the movie, instead of being a spectator.  Frida lives an interesting life, but if I can't connect with her character, then I can't really enjoy the movie.<br />So, in conclusion, this is a well-crafted film, but it assumes that you are familiar with and have an interest in Frida, which I am not and do not.  So, don't be an idiot like me and use this movie as your introduction to Frida.  Do your homework on her first.
0736041850|5.0|Am not using the book for strength training. Use it instead as a reference for stretching, or, if injured, to see which muscles are involved. <br />The strength exercises are the same reliable ones we've been doing for years. Interesting to see what is happening beneath the surface.
B00005JLD4|3.0|The story is a little too remote to identify with, but that doesn't really matter.  You identify with the three girls instead of the story.<br />The movie moves along quite slowly for the first half, and is pretty boring, but once you learn to connect with the plight of these three girls who want nothing more than to go home, this film affects you on an instinctual level.<br />Excellent cinematography of the australian plains.  The tearful eyes of the girls draw a paternal/maternal instinct from you that connects you personally with the girls.  The rest of the movie doesn't really matter, it is all based on the emotion generated by the three girls' journey home.<br />Watch this film at least once.  It may seem boring, but it is ultimately a powerful film if you can connect with the lead characters.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This was a GREAT movie! I never watched a Star Trek Movie, so I thought I would find it boring, but it turned out to be awesome! Everything is explained at the start and even though you may get confused at the beginning, everything falls into place. Graphics are great! If you love a great plot that gets you thinking, this is the movie for you!
0156027321|5.0|There were times in this tragicomic book that I simply had to let go, let go of reason, let go of that voice that intrudes the mind when incongruence surfaces,  and place myself firmly in the hands of the author, and I did so willingly.  And yet I was totally unprepared for where Pi and Mr. Martel would take me.  Now if only I would let God do the same...Read this book...read this book....read this book.<br />I close with a great quote from Pi...&quot;Reason is excellent for getting food...but be excessively reasonable and you risk throwing out the universe with the bathwater.&quot;
B000099T2L|4.0|Wow what a album! I wasnt much of a fan of Destinys Child's music but I can honestly say this albumn is the best thing I've heard since Justified!!  <br />Buy It!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ok first off if you dont know what Hybrid Theory EP is LP's very first cd released in 99'.Anyways Meteora is by far one of the better cds of today. With rhymes that can make your head spin and music that could make the house bounce , yes it is that good, it is a must buy.Favorite songs would have to be Don't Stay, Easier to Run, and From the Inside. So quit reading and go buy it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Enough! I'm embarassed I ever owned this idiotic waste of a perfectly good disc. (Needless to say, I gave it away.) If anything, the one star could be for the fact that you could use it for a coaster. Okay, I admit sometime music can be great in its simplicity (Ramones, etc.) but this is just macho-white-boy posing over \\"phat rapp-meddle beetz\\". If this is metal, than Shania Twain is NYC hardcore. OH! And lets not forget the brilliant poetic lyrics: \\"Yo,...Fred Durst! Leeyemp BEEZkeet! Cumin' atcha NOW, punk!\\" Shakespeare this ain't. Stop calling this guy a hardcore vocalist: all he does is whine, whine, whine! And what gives with \\"My Generation\\"? This guy is like 35. As for dissing the great Trent Reznor...this little group of nothings don't even deserve to MENTION his name. NIN is a million times better than these guys will ever be. (Not that that's much of an accomplishment.) Mr. Durst is enough of an egomaniac as it is. So everyone, please stop buying his albums. Maybe then he'll realize his talent is actually in the negatives, and go away. Pick up a Tool album instead. Your ears (and brain) will thank you.
1559409010|5.0|There are wilder movies, faster movies, more profound movies, maybe even funnier movies -- and there are movies that are much simpler and more perfectly made. But I don't really know any other movie that I enjoyed equally well (but differently) as a 20-year-old and as a 40-year-old. It's the richest work of a smart, nutty and talented group. It's in a class of its own.
B00006690G|1.0|Completely dreadful! Am I the only teenager left in America that's not buying into this? I don't understand what the big deal is. This guy just squeaks and cusses over a beat that sounds like a bunch of kids messing around with a keyboard at your local Radio Shack. (Aerosmith should [take action against Eminem] for butchering their classic \\"Dream On\\".) As for the lyrics: am I supposed to be offended? Am I supposed to be scared? Am I supposed to feel sorry for this guy? Sorry, but I don't feel any of those. Rest assured his 15 minutes of fame are just about over.<br />Click \\"Helpful\\" if you agreed with everything I just said, or click \\"Not Helpful\\" if you don't wanna believe any of it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|well this was an album that was highly anticipated a year before it even came out. And you know what...they didn't dissapoint at all. this album is like Led Zeppelin with an At the drive in twist to it but far from sounding like at the drive in. i fell in love with this album from the moment the intro started. the only song i dont care for is televators (kinda boring and long) which brings me to my next point. the songs are very long. they give you a good 7-9 mins a song so your in for a ride here. id definatly recommend buying this album. cant wait to catch the live show
B000000OTY|5.0|PG puts on a very good live show, and this CD is a good representation of it. Contains \\"Red Rain\\" which is not on the Secret World DVD, however San Jacinto (one of the high-points IMHO) is not here. The sounds quality is mixed well: the bass if very prominate, but it doesn't drown out the more subtle musical parts.
B00009V7T2|5.0|At the Drive-In is a great band. Sparta is a great band, too. Also, De Facto sounds very good. But The Mars Volta is something beyound that: it's brilliant, it's pure innovation and creativity summed up.<br />After hearing the band's EPs, I was kind of amazed; it was a great sound, and it had lots of potential. But they managed to improve that which seemed impossible, releasing a masterpiece, probably the best disc of this year, so far. The music flows perfectly from track 1 to 10, with amazing guitars, astonishing vocals by Bixler and lots -- and I mean lots -- of perfect noisy introspections.<br />The melodies are devastating; if you hear any song before leaving home, you'll surely be singing it five minutes later for the rest of the day. And it's not that kind of ... music that keeps hammering your head -- it's VERY GOOD music.<br />Well, I don't think I can say anything more. All the songs are equally beautiful, there is no particular best songs, but if someone wants to listen to samples before buying, try Drunkship of Lanterns, Eriatarka or Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt, as they clearly show the feeling of The Mars Volta.<br />That's it. If you like music, buy it. If you like good music, buy it now. If you like EXCELLENT music, hear it, as I assume you've already bought it.
B000002UA0|5.0|Before Pink Floyd became a colossal rock band churning out one gargantuan epic after another, they were a psycehdelic band fronted by a crazy, erratic and creative lad named Syd Barrett. He wrote the majority of the songs,and his vision was an inevitable influence on the band, even after they achieved stardom. The band takes off on psychedelic tangents on Astronomy Domine, and interstellar Overdrive, but the sound of the band at this time is also very playful and somewhat puerile, on songs like the zany Bike, the Gnome, and Scarecrow. The band at this time also did some straightforward psychedelic rock on songs like Lucifer Sam. This album is great, but it sounds VERY different from Dark Sdie or any Floyd release since. When I first heard it, I wasn't convinced that it was a Pink Floyd album. Sadly this was Syd's only album with the band since his LSD addiction worsened his mental condition (I believe it was schizophrenia) to the point where he could not function in the band anymore. He was replaced by Dave Gilmour, but the essence that Syd gave o the band inspired them to achieve further success and explore their creativity to the fullest extent.
B00000DLUV|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD, but when I bought it, I thought I was getting 24 whole songs. I did not know that nine of those songs were going to be a medley because they are all listed separately.<BR>My only complaint is that I didn't get all the songs I was going to get, now I have to buy more CD's to get the full songs.

B000002MJ0|5.0|this is one of the most beautiful, sexy, and noisy albums i have ever heard.  i enjoy it significantly more than their \\"loveless\\" or any other album by anyone for that matter.  i don't really feel the need to describe in depth the album or compare it to anything.  i can only recomend that if you have even thought about getting the album to do so.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This is a wonderful reminder of what Maiden once was.  The tracks are nicely laid out and I recommend that you listen to the album in its entirety, in order, at least once.  While I do not think this album competes with several other Maiden albums (Somewhere In Time, Seventh Son) it is very good and has a few songs which bring us back to the great days of Maiden. Brave New World is an excellent track, Wicker Man is very strong, but Out Of The Silent Planet is everything a Maiden song should be...It is Somewhere in Time, Powerslave, and Seventh Son rolled into one exceptional tune. My only complaint with the album is the evidence of Dickensons limitations.  I like Dickinson but his voice appears to have taken a beating over the years. Don't misunderstand, Dickinson does not sound bad on this album, the album vocals tracks are simply written for an aging voice...in other words there are no exceptional operetic moments that we have come to associate with Dickinson era Maiden.  If you are a true Maiden fan, you already have this album, but if you are a passive fan, this is one of Maiden's best and deserves some attention...check it out.
B00006LLNU|3.0|seeing sigur ros live was one of the most moving experiences of my life, as cheesy as that sounds.  and despite the fact that i really haven't been listening to  it much lately, it is still the best concert i've been to.  the album though:  it is sigur ros.  this alubm is even more ambient than their previous, whatever that's called.  over seventy minutes of pretty, often repetitive sounds.  very cool, worth having.  excellent for certian moods or falling asleep to.
B000063DI9|5.0|I was one of the die hards who thought that Somewhere in Time and Powerslave were in a class untouchable by future Maiden albums.  I was wrong.  Seventh Son is exceptional.  The production quality is high, the lyrics are very good, the music is so strong but intricate and powerful.  Honestly, this album has no weak points.  If you don't own this album, I pity you.
B000005HNQ|4.0|I have mixed feelings about The Gathering.  I don't like Anneke's vocals that much because of the way she wails, but it's not that big of a deal.  Their music gets a bit repetitive at times, and there's nothing about this album that can keep my attention for the entirety of it.  The title track is excellent, and there are a few more that really stand out, but there are also those that aren't so good.  I won't adorn this piece with praise and glory, but I do recommend checking it out.  If you're one who likes vocals that dominate the music, then you'll love it.  I will say that Anneke sings in a very down-to-earth and appropriate manner, but seems to push it sometimes.  The music is very atmospheric; not necessarily gloomy (although it is in some places) but very sensual.  It just can't hold my attention very long.  But it may for others, so don't shy away.

B00005JLYU|3.0|The eagerly anticipated sequel to the hit Charlie Angels in 2000 returns with a big bang with a double whammy in fun and preposterous sass. Like a glossy MTV of an action-comedy, Natalie (Diaz),Alex (Lucy Liu) and Dylan (Barrymore) provide eye-popping stunts that segue from jumping out of planes, a motorcycle race and dishing out graceful acrobatics and kongfu. Never mind the flimsy plot of ferreting out the mastermind behind the theft of two rings secreting information of FBI witness program. This movie is a joyous celebration of the chemistry and girl power when the trio hams it up like the bestest of friends. Cameos includes the comically larcenous Matt LeBlanc, John Cleese, Crispin Glover as the returning Thin Man, Luke Wilson and ex-angel Jaclyn Smith. Snazzy costumes, retro-dances and an unexpected treat in the form of Demi Moore striking out her first appearance after a three-year hiatus as Madison the villain gets things pumped up with energy and zest. The girls are so infectiously fun that this sequel delivers top notch angel-delic entertainment.
B000099T2L|5.0|Well I've been waiting for this cd to come out for almost six months now. I bought it the first day it came out and I must say, I was very surprised. At first I wasn't feeling the slow tempos.  But when I listened to the cd again, and actually listened to the words, I fell dangerously in love with it! The only songs I can live without on the cd are \\"Me, myself, and I\\" and of course \\"Hip Hop Star\\" featuring big boi from outcast. otherwise, the album is flawless.  Beyonce has shown that she is a talented singer, writer, producer, actress and all around entertainer. A true Beyonce fan needs this album to complete their collection!
6305252521|5.0|Often, people questioned whether or not Jim Carrey was capable of pulling off anything else than playing a moron with a funny face. Most of these people were silenced when 'The Truman Show' came out. Carrey proves he's more than capable of firing cheap (but funny) jokes at the audience. In fact, he does a helluva job as an actor here. <br />Truman Burbank is your average Joe. A boring administrative job at a bank. A house with a fence and a wife. Nice friends. Or are they? Or in fact, is he? <br />As it turns out, Truman, while being a baby, has become the world's first 24/7 soap star. He was removed from the 'real world' and placed into a giant city-sized studio. He's the world's most-viewed person on the planet, and doesn't realize it. <br />His friends are in fact hired actors. His city is nothing but props. His wife married him for the sake of the show (And probably her wage and the marketing beneficials). So what _IS_ in fact real? <br />Well, Truman is. Truman's dream is to head off to the Fiji Islands some day. Within his own (very small) world, Truman's life is genuine. The life, dreams, and thoughts of a real man, wanting to escape this place of utter boredom. Not that it's so bad there, but there's a whole world to explore, right? <br />With and with, Truman starts to realise he's trapped in a carefully and closely directed world. Slowly, but surely, he catches on, and tests the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the people directing his life. <br />The script itself challenges the reader. With soap operas occupying a LOT of airspace, and 'reality' programs like 'Big Brother' and 'American Idols' becoming more-and-more popular, where will it end? We already deprived people from their dignity and privacy. What's the next step? Their life? <br />Is our thirst for genuine TV enough to force us into this scenario? Or would we rather have reality game shows where people are being slaughtered alive? (See The Running Man).
B000002L68|5.0|How do I review an unimpeachable classic?Well lets take a<BR>look at the artists past.Prince had previously been known for<BR>producing his own varried,minimalist elecrto-funk/rock with<BR>overt erotic/political lyrics,even on \\"1999\\".But on \\"Purple Rain\\"<BR>Prince allows the mass public to enjoy and/or get into his music<BR>without losing his artistic integrity.Side 1 is pretty seamless-<BR>the opening rocker \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" and his Apollonia duet in<BR>\\"Take Me With U\\" and his unique electro-funk jam \\"Computer Blue\\".<BR>The live' Darling Nikky\\" may delve into the lust of yore but<BR>then you get \\"When Doves Cry\\"-simply put the greatest pop creation without a bassline.The intense \\"I Would Die 4U\\" doesn't<BR>go very far in it's magnifisance while \\"Baby,I'm A Star\\" leads<BR>the Revolution through a major-legue workout.Then theres the<BR>closing tital cut,a brilliant,catchy hard rock ballad that serves<BR>to sum up the overall albums culmination of soul,funk,pop and rock of the past 25 years before this.Black aand white musicians<BR>of all those genres have attempted to do the same thing with<BR>popular music but largly without the multitalented capabilities<BR>of Prince never quite achieved the same feel or results.Unlike<BR>the movie,the \\"Purple Rain\\" album is simply breathtaking!

0739302043|4.0|Wonderful book for a long drive. Not too technical or complicated. Good pacing with several twists and turns. It kept us guessing to the very end. We put the first CD in the player and waited in the driveway after we got home to hear the ending.

B000099T2L|4.0|As the official introduction, to Destiny's Child baby diva Beyonce Knowles solo debut, \\"Crazy In Love\\" invaded radio and clubs with it's rolicking drums and funky horns making the best and catchiest pop/R&B single so far this year. With funk and swagger replacing the sass of DC, and a video to rival any of J-Lo's flesh fests, the statement was clear. Beyonce was growing up. The album continues in that mold with with highlights like<BR>\\"Speechless\\", a sumptuous groove that features a breathy Beyonce in full sex kitten mode, and \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" a quirky rock tinged groove in which she titilates with lines like \\"I dare you to undress me\\". Other uptempo groove like \\"Naughty Girl\\", \\"Baby Boy\\" with Sean Paul and \\"That's How You Like It\\" with Jay-Z, while not exactly templates of innovation are more than servicable as a bouncy summer soundtrack. Knowles wrote or co-wrote all but 3 of the 15 songs, and while her attempt to truly make this album \\"hers\\" is admirable she often proves to be her own worst enemy. \\"Yes\\" comes across as trite and amaturish, \\"Me, Myself and I\\" is a cliched statement of female self-reliance and the disk's bonus track, a tribute to her father is sachrine to the point of being virtually unlistenable. The Missy Elliot penned and produced \\"Signs\\" is an aural treat thanks to Elliots off kilter production and a promising concept (astrological signs). Unfortunetly the lyrics amount to little more than a repeated naming of the different signs.<BR>Overall Dangerously in Love proves to be an enjoyable listen, but not the classic debut that many were hoping for.
0345409671|1.0|This book in the begining starts well with David talking about his new experiences as a vampire, but then Lestat becomes so entrenched in narcissism and rhetoric that everything becomes bland and boring.<BR>Memnoch is utterly unbelievable, as well as heaven. The most despicable character is Dora, supposedly religous but yet lets Lestat lap up her menstrual blood and give her some weird kinky oral sex ( what is up with that? Geez enough senseless erotica) ...hardly a candidate for someone deeply religous.<BR>It seems that, that Rice is trying to find her beliefs in these characters...yet it's effects are ultimatly contradictory. For if we read Queen of the Damned we see an entirely pagan viewpoint...it seemed entirely out of character for them all to believe these religous \\" artifacts\\" , especially the sensible Maharet, who supposedly was an expert in matters of the spirit. It seems we are expected to believe that Maharet is all of a sudden judgemental and meddling, when in past experiences she was distanced and caring, her philosophy being not to intefere...<BR>While it is true that these vampiric beings are allowed to change their viewpoint, their change isnt entirely convincing. The writing also seems sophmoric in this book , as well as entirely judgemental.<BR>I didnt care about the characters, and wished that the more sensible ones like Louis and David were allowed more of a voice. And as someone religous I found the sexual innuendos with God and Christ going a little too far. Try actually getting the mythologies straight.<BR>If people find this as an answer to their spirituality then they have a really messed up point of view.  Spirituality is not something confined to carnal desires and of the flesh but rather transcends it.<br />Geez what happened to the wonderful Queen of the Damned and other masterpieces? She should stop being so in love with theories and actually write a story for a change. <BR>Come back Anne Rice, we need you.
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh can describe tails of drama, history, and common mathematical sense into a great book.  While most people take cryptography for granted, Singh provides historical and simple examples to illustrate it's importance to mathematics and history.  He details it's use in wars, especially World War 2, and commerce.  He even delves into the political ramifications of strong versus weak encryption when discussing PGP.<br />Singh also provides easy to understand ways on how encryption works and even more intriguing, how to break it.  He shows how all various encryption algorithms are done, and then how code breakers can decipher them, both in practical and historical consequences.<br />In the end, he even provides a challenge for would be decipherers out there.  Granted, it's already been solved, it's still education and exciting that he offered a considerable amount of money for this challenge....<br />All in all, it's a fascinating book that will capture anyone's imagination, even if they hate history or math.
B0000086D2|3.0|I loved the movie, but was disappointed when they did'nt use Stoney and the guys on the bus for \\"Countdown To Love\\" on the CD.<BR>Where can I find out who the members of Fire Inc. are? Nowhere Fast and TIWIMTBY are the Bomb ! I give the movie \\"5 stars\\" but the CD \\"3 stars\\" because I felt cheated that \\"Countdown To Love\\" was not even close to being as good as it was in the movie.
0451528018|3.0|A mysterious hound is haunting a family estate, and the new heir has employed Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to investigate the hound, find out the death of his relative, and save the heir's life.  Throughout the book, the neighbors, the townspeople, an escaped convict and are all suspects.<br />While not a large book, the Hound of the Baskervilles does trudge along at some points.  The someone antiquated language aside, it does delve into more detail and much more build up than a typical Holmes' short story does.  So while in a short story, the mystery would be solved in minutes, in this book, the mystery takes a while to come forth.  For example, in the beginning there is a mysterious person in a stagecoach following the heir.  The mystery is only solved at the end, but with all the other events that took place, the reader has already lost interest in that particular person.  I personally forgot about it, thus it did not intrigue me at all.<br />Also, in much of this book, Holmes is not even present.  The wit and mystery are substituted with settings and descriptions instead, not Doyle's strongest points.<br />While a classic mystery which is still good, it can come out as somewhat unsatisfying.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love the show SMALLVILLE! It has got to be one of the best shows that people aren't watching! At first I thought it looked weird, but it is very intriguing. The stories are all great and the characters are very complex. There is a surprise in every episode. The main character, Clark Kent, struggles with his identity because he has all these powers and he doesn't know why. The truth is, he's Superman! Everyone should watch this show because it's one of the best on the WB! ...
B000099T2L|5.0|I have to say that this CD is one of my favorites this summer. Beyonce has some great dance songs and some nice slow jams. Jay-z, Missy Elliot, Luther Vandross, Sean Paul, and Big Boi &amp; Sleepy Brown are featured in some songs. Here is a review of each track.<br />Crazy In Love(4/5) The first single from the album has a nice vibe with Jay-Z featured in it. <br />Naughty Girl(5/5) This song kicks major bootay! Beyonce can be my naught girl any day! The song has a cool beat.<br />Baby Boy(4/5) You cant understand Sean in some of his parts. Baby Boy you stay on my mind, baby boy you are sodamn fine. Nice dance song.<br />Hip Hop Star(4/5) This song has rock vibe and I never hear beyonce say Hip Hop Star in the whole song. It's still a great song.<br />Be With You(4/5) The first slow song on the CD. This has to be one of Beyonce's best slow songs. This is like a song you would play when you are with your boyfriend or girlfriend.<br />Me, Myself And I(4/5) This song sounds like a song Destiny's Child would sing. This is a good slow jam.<br />Yes(2/5) big NO! must be the worst song on the album. The music is kinda cool but the words are ummm...<br />Signs(4/5) This song has a good beat and the words may sound funny talking about virgo, leo and all the signs but it sounds nice.<br />Speechless(5/5) This song left me Speechless!! It reminds me alot of Aaliyah, Left Eye and all the people that have died, I dont know what it is but something reminds me of them.<br />That's How You Like It(5/5) This is yet ANOTHER song featuring Jay-Z this songs has a good dance feel, might do good as a single.<br />The Closer I Get To You(4/5) Nice love/ slow song. It's a remake of the Luther Vandross song and also features him.<br />Dangerously In Love 2(5/5) If you like the Destiny's Child versoin you'll like this one, its the same almost.<br />Beyoncé Interlude - Your love goes beyond what I can say, Love, Beyonce.<br />Gift From Virgo(3/5) I know shes a virgo but making a song about it is kinda dumb. 2nd Worst song on the album.<br />Overall the CD was pretty good :)
B00008H2LB|4.0|This cd was GREAT! I really don't know why &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; was chosen for their first video, compared to the other songs, that one's not so good. <br />Really catchy songs, and session can also be found in the Matrix Reloaded CD. As much as I like this one, I still think the first one's better.
B00004R7PB|5.0|This is such a genuine performance.  I've never heard anything like it.  It is Baroque truly the way baroque was meant to be heard.  I hope everyone gets a chance to hear it.
B00005A46T|5.0|I think that their booklet is like, the coolest thing! It's sort of see through...hard to explain, but it's the coolest thing ever!! The songs are awsome, but I think the only bad part of it, is that the lyrics for the last song on the cd...so you can't sing along while u'r cd's playing, and, that that perticular song lasts 15 minutes and about 5 seconds... It's creepy tho... If u'r a fan of SlipKnot, you must buy this one!!
B00008DDSC|4.0|First, let me get this off my chest: I would give this movie five stars except for one long, unnecessary scene near the end of the movie. (*SLIGT SPOILER*)<BR>You know that the main character's boyfriend and her newer love interest, her boss, would eventually meet one another, and that there may be some unpleasantness. That encounter was handled well, but rather than ending the scene shortly, there was a continuation that brought in other characters. This irritated me and seemed to hurt the quality of the movie. Still, I found the majority of the film fascinating and would recommend it. <br />The acting was great. I have enjoyed James Spader in other films, particularly WOLF and STARGATE. He is definitely a versatile actor! The actor, who played the main character's boyfriend, Jeremy Davies, was good in SOLARIS; I believe the guy is disturbed which may be a compliment to his acting? The movie of course would not work at all if not for the lead actress' character Lee, wonderfully played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. She is thoroughly convincing as a shy, troubled girl, sort of like the sad young woman in the movie LILI. I felt very sorry for her, even though I couldn't relate to whatever pain was causing her to inflict pain on herself. I enjoyed the way the story changed (for the better) and the &quot;relationship&quot; between Lee, and her new boss started to develop. Some of the &quot;kinky&quot; parts may have been unnecessary, but I was convinced by the end the two main characters had reached a &quot;real&quot; relationship based on love and understanding. With any passionate and loving couple, there must be a series of high and low points that make the bond worthwhile, and this movie was one of the few that shows some conflicts rather than just implying &quot;They lived happy ever after.&quot; All and all, I enjoyed this film and found it refreshing to the usual, predictable movies being mass-produced for our undemanding public. I rarely ever consider giving a movie five stars, so THE SECRETARY is special, for me anyway.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of thoses rare cd's where no matter how many times you play it, you just CAN'T get sick of it! This cd's great for anybody! There's rap, sort of metal, a DJ...man! Anybody could enjoy this one!
B00006RU5B|3.0|I was not disappointed with this CD however I expected just a bit more from what I had heard of it on radio.  It is not a bad CD but it is a 50/50 as far as really good music and acceptable music.  It does tend to grow on one as you listen to it several times but it was not an instant love of mine.  Overall it is good but not the best.
0152023984|5.0|the little prince is by far the best book i've ever read. every time i read it it touches me even more. it makes me realize that small things are the things that matter. it is a masterpiece that everyone should read or should have read.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This move is great on so many levels. If your into romance, it has it, if you like comedy, it's in there too, if your a fan of cult films, it is ONE!  This is so complex it it's simplicity, or is it the other way around?  I'm not sure, but thats pritty much what the movie is like, it makes sence but your not quite sure, so you need, not need, but want to go back for a reviewing.  It makes you think...<BR>In a good way
B000002X4T|5.0|The first indication that the dark-hued bubble that the Airplane had themselves and us in for the past two releases had finally broken, though there was still a healthy, many-hued core of righteous alienation to us all to draw from. It was very good to see some daybreak after a long, dark, night. The passion's still just as prevalent, from it the new plant has finally sprouted. What will it grow into? This CD is a stunning, enraptured look at what might have been, had everyone of us had been able to live as passionately, as expressively as this music called out for.<br />\\"We Can Be Together\\" Probably the closest thing to a genuine counterculture 'hymn' that hippie evangelism ever produced, the genuineness of this paean cannot be overlooked then or now.<br />\\"Good Shepherd\\" An old folksong, dredged from the bottom a couple of years before by the Lyman Family (an outgrowth of the Jim Kweskin Jug Band of the Cambridge and Greenwich Village folk scene) on their landmark cult album 'American Avatar - Love Comes Rolling Down'. Superimposed upon all that had come before in the Airplane's oeuvre, the music and lyrics speak volumes.<br />\\"The Farm\\" It's no secret why this song and \\"A Song For All Seasons\\" both sound a whole lot like the style of the Grateful Dead of the same time period - Jerry Garcia played all the steel guitar licks on both songs. I was bemused reading that one reviewer actually wrote that he thought this was a satire on the back-to-nature communes of the era. Hardly . . . the Airplane were trying to bring all sorts of folks together with their music, not heap abuse on people.<br />\\"Hey Frederick\\" - a reprise of the styles of the previous two albums, but Grace Slick's singing shows a softer side, for the first time intoning a mellower sound even though the lyrics are anything but. About halfway through, the Airplane stretch out as the song escalates into a lengthy jam band motif. Here the jagged motorcycle imagery here works to near perfection.<br />\\"Turn My Life Down\\" is a mellow but impassioned Balin-sung song replete with David Crosby's singing organ licks, which make this sound more like a Crosby, Stills and Nash tune than one would ever expect before hearing it. But at heart it recapitulates some songs from back in '66 (on pre-Slick 'Jefferson Airplane Takes Off') and prefigures others from 6-8 years later in the band's later incarnation of Jefferson Starship. It also provides a needed rest/punctuation from the general intensity of this section of the CD.<br />\\"Wooden Ships\\" JA offered their terrific version of Crosby's song. This is one amazing bit of musical and poetic storytelling, with almost biblical pretenses (e.g. Noah's Ark 1000 times over), more than adequately backed up by a solid and flawless performance by all parties. No bad blips on the screen here.<br />\\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" is one of their best songs ever. The melodic palette is particularly exquisite, and, along with the little changes of meter (an Airplane 'thing' on numerous of their songs albums 3-5) is altogether gripping. The lyrics rely heavily on surrealist images and quick choppy changes of level/focus, and fit in wonderfully with the music. The funny thing is the music somewhat hides them - it's sometimes hard to hear where the text is going or where it's gone. But this seems to add to the song's power/affect.<br />\\"A Song for All Seasons\\" One of the other reviewers really trashed this one. But once again . . . we were in the early glory days of country rock. Creedence Clearwater Revival, Buffalo Springfield, Crosby Stills and Nash, the Grateful Dead, the Youngbloods, Taj Mahal, the Band, and Bob Dylan were just some of the big guns devoting all or most of their energies to this genre, at this time in history. And numerous other bands were giving occasional nods in this direction. Once again, the flavoring(s) from Garcia's pedal steel guitar is a complete glory.<br />\\"Meadowlands\\" The Airplane's requisite psychedelic lollipop, a quick little bookmark to punctuate the proceedings: 'Baxters' had \\"A Small Package of Value\\", 'Crown' had \\"Chushingura\\". Each fits its way into the psychic climate of the given musical moment in a incisively expressive fashion.<br />\\"Volunteers\\" Probably their only bad-sounding song since before Grace had joined the band (just before \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\"). Of course in '69-'70 most of us didn't feel that way about it. Here they were sounding tough and hard, siding with revolution overtly; before they'd been busy probing their psyches and changing/elevating their consciousness, dragging us along with them as willing participants. On the album as a whole, they sought to pull and keep the troops together - the back-to-the-earth and the revolution folks, plus everyone else who wanted to \\"go ride the music\\" - there were LEGIONS of hippies and counter-culturalists aboard the metaphorical 'wooden ships'.<br />It takes all kinds - you can be sure there was a healthy assortment of fraternity/sorority brothers and sisters who were heavily and passionately involved - don't ever doubt that '69 was a divine, pan-cultural time. \\"We're the Volunteers of America!\\" Paul Revere and the Raiders gone a couple of steps beyond? The Salvation Army? Jokey, yes, but also metaphorically telling.<br />All in all, this album/CD made quite a statement; if you weren't alive then, try feeling it for what it is, and imagine what it had to do with getting us where we are today. And you just \\"go ride the music!\\"little bookmark to punctuate the proceedings: 'Baxters' had \\"A Small Package of Value\\", 'Crown' had \\"Chushingura\\".

B00005V3Z4|5.0|WARNING: DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE. IT IS NOT WORTH IT TO RUIN THIS MOVIE BY READING THIS REVIEW. This movie is obviously misunderstood by some of the lower life forms out there. This movie will draw you in and keep you interested if you have the ability to follow complex stories. You have a right not to like this movie. But when I watch this movie I see the story of a person who fell in love, and when the choice was presented before him that he could go on living or sacrifice himself to save the person he loved. Donnie chose to sacrifice himself. The story is one of true love. He sacrifices himself for no honor. The girl he loves does not even remember him after the act. This is the story of a true superhero who sacrifices all for the one he loves.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD is so cool i cant even stop listening to it. Its one of the Best CD's i have. and i would also recomend that u buy the dvd also. Thats Great too.
B000066O91|5.0|It's a really really good cd. I got it before I'd Do Anything was on the radio and I haven't stopped listening to it since. Don't judge the band on I'd Do Anything or Addicted. Even though those are both great songs, the rest on the cd are even better. SP is kind of a mix of Blink-182, Green Day and New Found Glory so if you're into any of those bands, check this one out.
B00006CXXU|5.0|What an excellent album!  What an excellent singer!  Miles away from her first effort, and I enjoyed that as well, Christina's diversity and range on Stripped is no less than phenomenal.  All of you turned off by her image - count me in - will be pursuaded by her music. So put the \\"Dirrty\\" side away and enjoy. <br />Was most impressed with the fact that she wrote and produced a few numbers on this record as well. <br />Fave songs?  An impossible question because the entire CD is a pure pleasure all the way through. Good job Christina!
630170648X|5.0|I was on a tour in Europe, when this movie was put in.  Instead of a much needed rest, I got a great laugh fo an hour or so.  Its a classic.  Worth the purchase price and a lot more!
B00000099Y|4.0|I looked through a great number of the reviews that there are for this album, and I honestly read the bad reviews more often than the good ones, because I want to see what those few people disliked about Ænima.  Very few of them give any reason for disliking it.  Those that do, I give you credit for at least taking the time to think it through.  I do understand why some of you do not like this album.  I have pictures in my head of telling my brother, whom is much older than me and grew up listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd and Leon Russell, to pick this up and give it a listen.  He would probably hate it and not listen to more than a few minutes.  That is simply a matter of what you listen to and what your ears can stand.  I have heard on radio news that we are making captured terrorist types listen to Metallica and Megadeth as a form of torture.  I can't understand this... (Unless they are referring to Load, Reload or Megadeth's last couple of albums.{Obviously torture for anyone})  I can think of nothing that I'd like better than to listen to Ride The Lightning and So Far, So Good...  So What back to back, except listening to Tool.  <BR>I actually was going to give the album 5 stars, but I figure that the lack of a star might get this read more.  I justify this by saying that if Undertow is my favorite Tool album, which it is, and it would be my standard for 5 stars, Ænima can be 4.  Also, -(ions) starts to make me batty if I listen to it all the way through.  We'll just say, I give this album a low 5 stars.  ;)<BR>So, I'll conclude this by saying, if you are a huge U2, or Bruce Springsteen fan, you might not like this.  If you are into Cher or Mariah Carrey, you might wanna let this slide by.  On the other hand, if you like heavy, blistering, scathing music that might shock you on your first listening, you might wanna give this a try...  And hey, if you like lighter stuff, you might wanna start with Lateralus.  (It's the lighter side of Tool, I'd say, but don't expectthe Partridge Family.)  A Perfect Circle might be a good intro to Maynard's vocal style too, but remember that they aren't really Tool.  They're good though.<BR>I hope this made things clearer for a few people.  I'll conclude by saying that I've made some generalizations about people that like certain kinds of music and I mean you no ill will.  You are certainly permitted to like what you wish, however, I'd say that everyone, even those that I discluded before might wanna try giving this album a few listens, just in case your tastes are improving.  (Sorry, had to get that jibe in there.)  I know many people whom hated many of the Beatles albums when they came out, only to end up loving them.  Same with Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and a few other of the greats.  This is bound to happen when a band is inventing the genre that they are playing in.  Thanks for reading my ranting!
B000092ZYX|3.0|I dont understand it when people talk about HTTT as a masterpiece when it does not even come close to some of their previous work. OKC was THE BEST album RADIOHEAD has released and nothing else they make will ever come close to that album. KID A and amnesiac were average and this is the category HTTT falls into. After the first listening I hated it and thought it was the worst album I have ever listened to, with the exception of THERE,THERE, but I decided to listen to it again and again.I liked it more each time I heard it but some songs are just weak and pointless.The strongest track by far is THERE,THERE which hypnotizes you with its beats and whisperings. I also liked Sit Down,Stand up because of the piano playing by Thom. Overall this album is another experiment by RadioHead which is very average and they should try going back to their roots and make an album similar to OKC, even though it will be a great challenge.
0345413377|2.0|Make no mistake; Pullman can write. His characters are interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed the romp throught the Universe represented by the Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife. I would give Pullman 5 stars for creativity and for fun and adventure. I would give him fewer stars for depth of characters created, but still would rank him highly.<br />Why, then, the 2 stars? <br />Pullman's whole purpose in writing these books, as far as I can tell, was to blame all of the world's problems on the evils of authoritarianism. OK, fair enough. But _any_ authoritarianism isn't good enough; for Pullman, there is only _one_ authoritarianism, and that's the authoritarianism of the Catholic church. <br />I won't go into the fact that Pullman's facts are wrong, and that his depiction of the Catholic church in Lyra's world is warped into the worst caricature of the worst abuses found in virtually any human institution. That's bad enough. But what really astounds me is that Pullman depicts, in the course of these three books, almost _all_ religions and philosophies other than Christianity and calls them good. At last count, I had seen instances of Paganism, Shamanism, Spiritualism, Agnosticism, Atheism, Scientism, and a watered down form of Buddhism. All these = good. Christiantiy, however = bad.<br />For an author who seems to say that what's wrong with the world is the narrow-mindedness, hypocrisy, and bigotry represented by his version of Catholicism, I find it highly ironic that his own narrow-mindedness, hypocrisy, and bigotry is so obvious in this third book. What started out as a fascinating journey becomes a trilogy with a MESSAGE. And that message is so heavy handed and so bruises the issues of good and evil raised that the entire trilogy ultimately becomes a big moral muddle. <br />I can't recommend the trilogy, even with its excellent writing and compelling story line. Even as a romp, it fizzles in the end, and apparently the big climax of the trilogy (pun intended) is the discovery that having premarital sex fixes all the ills in the Universe. <br />Gimme a break....
B00004U2G4|4.0|Any quitarist worth her salt will tell you that Beck is the only player who can rate with Hendrix in terms of raw talent (maybe Duane Allman slips in there as well).  This record is pure, unadorned blues/rock Beck and is essential listening for anyone serious about rock guitar.  This is not to slight Blow By Blow or Wired from the mid-70s fusion period, but as a *rock* player, this is Beck at his best.  Many have said that this album is the template for heavy rock, released slightly before the first Led Zeppelin album.  Nevermind who came first, this is the one to go to, guitar-wise.<BR>Album overall is three and one-half stars.  As a testament to quitar genius, it rates five.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Holy Frickin' Kermit Jesus! This is the greatest movie ever! Stephen Chow uses comedy and clever digital effects to make the most outstanding soccer-movie, love-story, kung-fu-film of all time! Stop whatever you're doing and see this movie RIGHT NOW. Even if you hate soccer you'll love this flick. From the title theme to the closing credits, this film is so ingenious and well put-together that the moment it ends you'll feel the urge to watch it again.<br />This may be the closest we've ever come to wearing-out an indestructable DVD. Prepare to buy another DVD player because you'll burn out the old one watching this over and over. vastly entertaining and with a hilarious ending, this film is worth every cent spent making it, and every cent buying it!
B00008S2VG|5.0|As far as I'm concerned Madonna is the best and she keeps getting better.  This cd seems to be very personal to her.  The songs are thought provoking and at the same time fun to dance to.
0689859368|5.0|My two sons and I loved this book!  I teach and am always looking for books that are age appropriate.  Harry Potter is high interest, but too difficult for most of my kids.  This will give those children what they want at their reading level!!!  This series definitely fills the void!
B00005JLF5|1.0|I've been enjoying all of the treks coming out on DVD so naturally I purchased the first three seasons of DS9.  I am finding the sets drab, the characters are all boring me as they strive to be such phoney &quot;demi god, perfection&quot; that I am struggling with my attention span.  Example: &quot;My darling I know that coming to DSP cost you your career as a botanist.  Please, I beg you to take our daughter and go on this expedition as a botanist.&quot;  She responds, &quot;I knew that I was giving up my career.&quot;  <br />This isn't entertainment.  This is so dull I can't see straight.<BR>I really did not want to spend 300 dollars in seasons, for somebodies socially progressive example of how we should all be behaving in our lives according to themselves.<br />If you want to wallow in socially progressive politics DS9 is for you.  Just remember the rest of us love the Klingons and follow their example.  The socialist ideal lessons on us were not absorbed or learned.  <br />So far as I am concerned the popularity of Star Trek was abused by someone with a hidden agenda and it is DS9.
B000099T2L|5.0|THIS CD IS AWESOME!  BEYONCE' HAS AN AMAZING VOICE AND NO ONE OUT THERE SOUNDS LIKE HER.  SHE HAS SOME AMAZING LYRICS AND MELODIES.  SOME CD'S YOU BUY YOU SKIP OVER SOME OF THE SONGS, BUT EACH AND EVERY SONG ON THIS CD COULD BE SINGLE.  I AM TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THIS CD AND I AM NOT BIASED BEING FROM HOUSTON.  CONGRATULATIONS B!  YOU DID YOUR THING!
B0000959N0|5.0|I love this movie.  Affleck made ma believer.  Colin Farrell is absolutely hilarious as Bullseye.  And Jennifer Garner has now officially cemented her status as the Sexiest Woman Alive!  I have read this comic since I was a teenager and feel that the filmmaker really captured the spirit of Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  Daredevil has always been one of the darker, more interesting characters and the movie shows this off with great aplomb.  The look and sound separation in this film was also excellent and will make for a great DVD to show off my home theater too.
B000001FHV|4.0|Great album that has a indie rock vibe in the songs &quot;Backwater&quot; and &quot;We Don't Exist.&quot; Also of note is the unlisted hidden track, &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; which is just a timeless classic. I can see this song being covered many times over and being passed on from generation to generation. True classic.
B00009V7T2|5.0|....seriously.   everything about this album and band resonates.  a true departure and evolution for all involved.  through this stunning effort:  omar has proven himself to be the true creative force of his previous band, and a far better guitarist/composer than the confines of that project allowed.  cedric is singing ....soaring...jon theodore is creating a whole new vocabulary for drummers to learn from.  ikey and michael(r.i.p.) are twisting and bending the sonority with deft fingers.  and flea is expressing a musicality that has long been missing at his day job.  the resultant effect is devestating.  not since the emergence of tool, has a rock band displayed this much emotive substance and depth.  do right for yourself.  be open.  buy this.  live with it.  learn.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i love this cd.  any fan of john mayer would know this is his best work yet.  with his light, jazzy beats and husky voice, it makes a perfect duet.  get yours today, you won't be disappointed!
B000092ZYX|5.0|\\"Hail to the Thief\\" is a compromise. No moment on the album better describes this point than the first opening seconds where Johnny Greenwood is plugging in his guitar. For some fans, this is a cause for rejoice. They feel that for the past two albums of Radiohead's career, guitars were too largely removed from the mix. They also feel that Radiohead is at their best as a guitar band, as this lead them to produce what they call \\"greatest album ever recorded,\\" even though it has currently only existed for six years. For another group of fans (clearly lesser in number), \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" were not difficult albums, but interesting and enthralling ones. Not knowing where Radiohead would go next was not seen as depressing, but exciting. Perhaps to lessen tensions between the two fan bases they have created, Radiohead seems to take the middle ground with \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" as they borrow stylings from both their guitar/piano-driven side and their more experimental side this time out. Don't get me wrong, \\"2+2=5\\" is great with its electric rock blast of a finale, but why is this the only side of Radiohead that some fans can enjoy? I feel it's time for some to move on, as this style is just not the full picture of the band's abilities anymore. I'm not saying their rocking side is better or worse, just that I feel they can now do other styles equally as well. I still enjoy songs like \\"The Gloaming\\" (gasp!), as they describe unpopular human emotions that I feel just as much as any other. Give all the songs a fair chance, as they are all growers that have emotional resonance and meet Radiohead's high standards, whether upbeat or not. \\"There There\\" is undeniably the biggest standout (possibly my favorite Radiohead song yet) and the melancholy of \\"I Will\\" and style mixing of \\"Myxomatosis\\" are also not to be missed. As for the political comments that some have made, I feel that the lyrics are still abstract enough to allow different interpretations (as in all great music)andI'm glad Radiohead don't feel the need to be overly-pushy with their personal views. Yorke seems to understand that in his position, giving concealed clues to his own standpoint is far wiser than being too explicit. Sept. 11 and its resulting war has worked to the band's advantage and only made their somber moods more appropriate, since most people can at least agree that the day that started it all was a great loss. In retrospect, we should have seen this abstract political theme coming in Radiohead's music, as \\"You and Whose Army\\" was rumored to be about Tony Blair and his \\"cronies.\\" I feel the most politically explicit song on the new album by far is \\"We Suck Young Blood.\\" Anyway, enough politics. I can only hope that this musical compromise by the band wins back at least some of the fans lost during \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" sessions, as I am still annoyed with the fairly popular negative consensus that those albums received from some fans. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" disproves the \\"emperor's new clothes\\" theory once and for all, as Radiohead prove to be equally comfortable in both of their stylings. If you, however, are still not comfortable with Radiohead having more than one dimension to their music, than please stop listening and complaining. Please find some lesser band to harp on. After all, disgruntled fans can always hail to the thieves instead, better known to the world as Coldplay.
0802130208|3.0|I've been struggling with this review for quite a while, trying very hard to take a stand on how I feel about this book.  It's a book beloved by so many people (my husband among them), yet it's reviled by probably equally as many.  I had a very hard time determining which side I was on.  I think I may be one of the very few sitting on the fence.<br />Toole's characterization of Ignatius is indeed a brilliant portrayal of a self-centered, lazy, cynical and repulsive man, but I had a hard time finding his exploits funny.  I've met people like Ignatius, and quite frankly, I want to get away from them, not indulge them as they attempt to skew the rest of the world their way.  I truly despised Ignatius, and couldn't wait to finish the book to be rid of him.<br />But, how can I fault an author who managed to evoke such a strong feeling of disgust from me?  That's obviously the result of some darn fine writing.  The story flows smoothly, combining Ignatius' misadventures with those of the other characters in a climactic conclusion that brought them all together an effectively amusing little tangle.  So here I sit on the fence - I don't want to meet Ignatius again any time soon, but I don't regret having spent a little time with him.
B00005QIPH|5.0|All of my reviews have been 5 stars, but for a reason. They are the albums that got bad reviews, even though they are ground-breaking and deserve the utmost respect. This album has done something rather wonderful. <br />Amist all of todays [bad] music, the Strokes come out with an album unlike any other. I recall going to my bookstore, looking up albums on this neat computer thing that you can listen to 30 second cuts of any song. So I come across the Strokes and figure I'll give it a listen. On just the first song I think it is a great, and I continue through and I figure, there is no way I'm leaving this store without it. So I buy it.<br />I'm figuring this band is from the 70's (sorry, I'm not up to date with today's music). So i feel like I should look it up on the internet, see their other albums. Suprise, its from 2001. This album has brought back the wonderful sounds of the past, and in it's own unique way, brought it back with a wonderful sound.<br />This is a wonderful album 50% based on what it has done and 50% on the wonderful sound. It is incredible, and after having it only 5 days, I've probably listened to it 10 times. Just listen to \\"Someday\\" and you're sure to become addicted.

B00005YXZH|5.0|I have about 500 reviews to be shadowed by, but if you do come to this one, let it be the last. This album by no means is a great album, but it is worth every penny. Take a couple listens. You'll soon like after playing it enough, you just have to get used to it.<br />There are a bunch of reviewers who tied in the hype of this album into their reviews, and that should not be a factor. If people think it is good or bad, why should you care? Not everybody is the same. Simply just download a few songs on Kazaa (preferrably Kamera or Jesus Etc.) and if you like it, buy it.<br />To me it is incredibly deserving, and by no means a rip-off of or anything similar to Pink Floyd (considering Pink Floyd is by far my favorite band). The tunes are soft, sweet, and meaningful. It's easy-listening. It's good for the car, work, or relaxing. If you want something thats upbeat, this isn't it. Just something that makes you think and wonder.<br />Don't worry about what other people think. Take the facts. It's easy-listening that has a meaning. Listen to pieces of the album, and if it's what your looking for get it. I know I'll never regret it.
B000063DFN|5.0|This was my very first album, which I decided to buy after hearing 2 Minutes to Midnight on GTA:VC.  But anyways, this is a truly great album, packed with very good songs, and not song is completely bad.  Bruce Dickinson's voice may a take a bit of getting used to (as with Dave Mustaine), but eventually it sounds great (such as in Rime of the Ancient Mariner).  The bass is also visible, which is something I rarely see in metal albums.<br />1. Aces High: Such a great opening riff to such a great song, and then the pre-verse riff is the best riff on the album.  The verse seems a bit lacking, as the music coordinates a bit too much with the vocals.  The pre-chorus is very good and thunderous, and the chorus is just plain great.  It also contains a good solo.<BR>Rating: A<br />2. 2 Minutes to Midnight: The song that got me into Iron Maiden, the main riff in the song is sweet, and in my opinion, Dickinson's voice sounds incredible in this song.  The chorus is great as well, and the soft part in the middle is great.<BR>Rating: A-<br />3. Losfer Words (Big 'Orra): An odd name, but a \\"bright\\" feeling to this song with some odd sounding riffs.  Good song, though.<BR>Rating: B<br />4. Flash of the Blade: While many Maiden fans love this song, I dislike it the most on the album.  The beginning is good, as it reminds me of In Flames' \\"Bullet Ride\\", but yet the rest of the song seems kinda bad to me.<BR>Rating: C<br />5. The Duellists: Better than the previous track, but still nothing too amazing.  It does contain a cool instrumental middle section.<BR>Rating: B+<br />6. Back In the Village: Talk about heavy duty!  The two opening riffs in the song are very fast and very good.  I also love the whole entire song altogether, a fast paced song, but the chorus needed a bit more.<BR>Rating: B+<br />7. Powerslave: A very good title track for a very good album.  The lyrics are very well thought out, and the music compliments them perfectly.  The pre-chorus riff is absolutely menacing!An overall great song.<BR>Rating: A<br />8. Rime of the Ancient Mariner: A very long song, and a super-epic, yet very good.  The only bad part about this song is the middle with just a bassline.  However, this song is not to be missed.<BR>Rating: A+<br />And to end that note, this whole album is not to be missed!
B000021XS0|5.0|The best way to listen to this CD is in the dark.  The music is so full and powerful throughout the entire play that visual stimulation only hinders it.  You must think of this as a play you wish to see.  Pay attention and value it for the masterful opera that it is, and this will easily become a favorite.
B00005RYL2|3.0|You can read the other reviews for a synopsis of the story and the movie, I am reviewing the quality of the latest release that recently came out with DTS. The video quality is mediocre at best.<BR>The graininess comes and goes and is mostly atributable to the quality of the source being used. This gets a 2-3 stars. The audio quality and use of DTS was nothing to write home about. The audio did seem to be at an awfully low level compared to other DTS discs that I have watched. I would give the audio 3-4 stars. For a gauge on my comparisons I would give the DTS version of Gladiator 5 stars all around.
B00005BF9Z|4.0|To begin with, I will like to point out that some of the songs in this album sound like children's music. Most of the lyrics lack the strong political commentary that appealed to many.  Secondly, the use of melodies from his past album makes you feel like he chooses to recycle something that was worth gold over coming up with something new.  This said, my favorite song of this album is &quot;Hommes&quot; which shares the melody with &quot;King of Bongo&quot;.  I think, however that the new lyrics are so good and new that it makes me forget of melodies of past albums. It is like listening to the melodies for the first time. I really enjoyed this CD.  Songs like Mr. Bobby and Me Gustas Tu have enough of what it takes to make them extraordinary pieces of music which provoke in your soul what good pieces of music are supposed to do.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce's debut album is amazing...Every single song is great.<BR> <BR>1.) Crazy in Love- 1st single...great upbeat song<BR>2.) Naughty Girl- sexy song..love it<BR>3.) Baby Boy- reggae type song with Sean Paul..love it<BR>4.) It's okay...really don't like big boi<BR>5.) I'd Rather Be...another sexy song...great<BR>6.) Me, Myself and I...I love this song...anthem for ladies who have dogs as boyfriends.<BR>7.) Yes...I love this song...another ballard<BR>8.) Signs...not the best song on the album...but it's ok<BR>9.) Speechless...another sexy song...love it<BR>10.) That's How I Like...I love this song...it's cute<BR>11.) The Closer I Get to U...an oldie but goodie :)<BR>12.) Dangerously In Love 2...I don't really understand the part 2...it's the original song with a slightly different beat.. but it's still a good song.<BR>13.)Beyonce Interlude...u really can;t rate an interlude<BR>14.)Gift from Virgo...in my opinion this is one of the best song's on the album...it's a touching song dedicated to her father...very sweet<br />All in all Beyonce's debut album is wonderful...she's an amazing singer/songwriter. I hope, as one of her many loyal fans, that she comes out with many more wonderful albums. I give this c.d. 10 fingers up (LOL, just a little joke)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When I saw the film previews I had no idea of what a good film this actually was.  I thought it was just going to be some silliness trying to pass itself off as grand indie art.  The thing is, this film really IS grand indie art!  I was quite shocked by the ways in which this film deviates from the normal formulaic storyline every other Hollywood movie falls into.<br />This is a film that can't be easily described, certainly not without ruining it.  I think that this film deserves at least one viewing, perhaps more.   Its definitely the kind of film you need to reserve discussion time for.<br />I am eagerly awaiting the Director's Cut to be released in theatres!
0316776963|3.0|This book is funny; however I definitely have read things far more comedic. I like the short story format, and some of the stories are great - however I did not read the first book, Naked, so perhaps I am slightly out of the loop. Despite the fact it isn't supremely funny there are some laugh out loud moments that make the book certainly worth your while.
B00008AWOD|5.0|This album is a positive leap forward for Placebo.  It sees the band adding a more smooth electronic element to numerous songs and sees more melody and edge than before.  Songs such as &quot;English Summer Rain&quot;, &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, &quot;Special Needs&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Yours&quot;, and &quot;Protect Me From What I Want&quot; are standouts in my opinion.  But the title track takes top honors...&quot;Sleeping With Ghosts&quot; is in my opinion the best Placebo song ever recorded, just ahead of &quot;Without You I'm Nothing&quot; which I rate second.  Once again, this album is definitely a positive turning point, I already anticipate album 5.
B000002L5I|4.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd is a great guitarist, no doubt, and that's ultimately the appeal of his music. If you do not like guitar-based music, you'd do well to stay away from this CD. It's basically only for fans of guitar-heavy blues rock. On that level, it's a success. The songs are adequate, but mostly forgettable, and serve as little more than a backdrop for Shepherd's guitar. The lyrics are sometimes painfully derivative, and pretty uninteresting overall. However, the music is so good that the lyrics hardly matter. Vocalist Noah Hunt has a good voice, and sings with conviction but the words he sings just seem to be empty words. The songs about love and women just seem kind of phony coming from such young guys.<br />The best songs are Slow Ride, Blue On Black (a rock radio favorite), Chase The Rainbow and Somehow, Somewhere, Someway. The Hendrix cover I Don't Live Today is also fun. <br />Trouble Is... is a fine album for fans of blues-rock. If you like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter and other bluesy guitarists, then I would recommend this CD as well as Kenny Wayne's debut, Ledbetter Heights.
0060005424|5.0|I came across this book by chance, tucked discreetly into a shelf at a local book fair. It sounded like a breezy, run-of-the-mill fantasy story when I first began it but I became so engrossed in what was happening that I finished it in less than 3 days. <br />The premise, as you probably have read, is that Lirael is desperate to recieve the Sight. Because no Clayr her age is without it she feels like an outcast. The desperation of Lirael is so sad and somehow a little disturbing. But eventually it helps her to discover more and more about herself. <br />Later you will see that Lirael is gradually growing into her position in life more and more due to the help of her aquaintance, the Disreputable Dog (who I should mention is absolutely hilarious and very blunt). <br />All around the descriptions are amazing, the premise is completely original, centered mainly around the coming of age of first Lirae, and then Sam (and of course there is always Mogget). And I highly suggest (if you are anything like me) that it's very interesting to read Lirael and then Sabriel. At least, that's what I did.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I pre-ordered Faceless eager to hear the lastest from Godsmack.  I have been a tremendous fan for many years and thought nothing could top the GODSMACK CD until AWAKE came out.  After hearing FACELESS, they have outdone themselves again.  The sounds and vocals from the title FACELESS to MAKE ME BELIEVE are just amazing!  I AM and RE-ALIGN are also awesome.  I can't forget SERENITY either!  I can't say enough about every song on this CD.  I listen to it over and over.  Their tremendous talent and knack for connecting with their listeners it what makes me a GODSMACK fan for life!!!
B00005TT77|3.0|Why do people insist that cover tunes should sound exactly like or &quot;in the same style&quot; as the original? Eddie Vedder hoarsely singing vocals over the same song isn't interesting at all. The Grandaddy cover of Revolution is what this album should be about, a clever interpretation of a great song. If you want to listen to Beatles songs sung just like John and Paul, then buy one of the 85,000 Beatles compliations already out there.
0684857219|5.0|I have been looking for a book like this for some time. It is chock full of an extraordinary amount of body building information. Nutrition, programs, competition, history and more all wrapped into an 800 page package. I am an amateur body builder and it has helped my training tremendously. I would recommend this to anyone weight training, at any skill level, as the book has helpful programs and hints for all levels of developement.<br />Training a muscle group three times a week (as stated by another reviewer) is not over training when you work up to it. Massive results require massive commitment and routine. Just don't jump into the advanced program if you have never lifted a barbell before. ;)
B00005JM03|3.0|The Italian Job is a remake of a British film of the same name.  I doubt there is a great deal here that is reminiscent of the original except the Minis.  That said, the actors in this film are quite obviously having a great time and it shows.  These actors are up to the task and then some.  Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sutherland, Seth Green, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Mos Def and a few others are here chewing up the scenery, milking the fun for all it's worth.<br />The plot is relatively simple:  Thieves who don't use guns steal 37 million in gold bricks - they get double crossed and have it stolen themselves - then they attempt to retrieve their ill-gotten gains.<br />What my synopsis doesn't tell you is there are all sorts of fun Bond-like devices and screwy situations that will keep you laughing and amazed at the same time.<br />Mark Wahlberg amazes me.  He earned my respect in Boogie Nights, but here he shows he's got longer legs to stretch as he tackles the straight man role in a comedic film.  He is really up to the task.<br />Seth Green is hilarious in his role, Norton, suitably creepy, Mos Def - unknown to me before - really a contender, and of course, Charlize Theron as the ingenue, is believable and engaging.<br />Nah, this film isn't great, but it's really good and it's almost good \\"clean\\" fun.  There is no sex, plenty of violence (but none graphic and none that is any worse than you'll find on TV), and only a few four letter words (to suitably secure a PG rating).<br />I think you'll have a blast watching this film.  I know I did.
B000099T2L|2.0|BEYONCE....COME ON NOW.   This cd is not what i expected at all.  the style is not like the beyonce we know from dc or we've heard on '03 bonnie and clyde. I am dissappointed.  The best song on the cd is Crazy in love.  I had hoped it would have been better than this.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Face it and admit it to yourself, Britney is here to stay. Her sound only gets better with each album, and with this album, is all good. There are no fillers here. I do wish however that \\"Before The Goodbye\\", \\"I Run Away\\", and \\"When I Found You\\" were featured on the American release, because they are amazing, stand-out tracks. Britney's voice is way too underrated. Her voice is perfect for the music she sings. She has a low, soulful voice that flows perfectly with R&B club tracks and soft, soulful ballads. The album starts out with three upbeat, dance tracks: \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\", and \\"Lonely\\". All of these songs are great and alot of fun. Next up is the ballad \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", which is probably the Britney song that has more meaning to it than anything she'd done before. Next up are \\"Boys\\" (another great Neptunes track), \\"Anticipating\\" (a midtemp disco song, alot of fun and very different), \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\" (for a pop cover of this song, very well done, Britney's voice sounds perfect), \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Let Me Be\\" (an awesome track about being proud to be who you are, I love this one). Next up is \\"Bombastic Love\\", a soft sounding uptempo ballad. I love the lyrics. Next is my favorite, \\"That's Where You Take Me\\". It has sweet lyrics, and Britney sounds so soulful on this track. The album ends with \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\". This track is a great dance track but it's average. Justin does add some to this one. So overall, out of all the pop albums, this is the one to own. Along with Stripped, pop music is being redefined as its own genre.
0783113943|5.0|Angelina Joile does a fantastic job on this movie and portrays the character very well.  Its almost like you know her.<br />This movie was emotional, as well as educational.  It shows how drugs can screw up your life so much, when she had such a promising career and life ahead of her.  I think it would be a really good movie for a recovered drug addict to watch.  I absolutly loved it and i would reccomend it to almost anyone.
0887307280|5.0|&quot;If you own a small business, or if you want to own a small business, this book is written for you.&quot; The central theme is that to be successful, a small business owner should structure their business as though it could be turned into a franchise -  like your business is a prototype for 5,000 more turn-key businesses just like it, which anyone could take over and operate according to your documented standards and procedures, and they'd almost be guaranteed a profit. Design a business that is itself a product that someone would want to buy because of its effective methods and working models. The author doesn't encourage actually selling or franchising your business, but states that a successful business worth selling or franchising would be so because of its easily-repeatable, income-generating potential. A key message in the book is that business owners should work ON their business, not just IN their business.

0930289234|4.0|This incredibly layered maxi-series (originally released monthly) caught on the new wave of pop-culture in which cultural icons were only fit to be destroyed.  For a generation of comics fans who couldn't stand to hear \\"truth, justice and the American way\\" one more time, \\"Watchmen\\" gave us the travails of two generations of costumed vigilantes long after they were broken by their experiences.  Among these is the Comedian, a smiling sadist whose calling card (the smiley button) becomes the series' icon.  Unlike most heroes forced into retirement by age, restrictive legislation and a society less tolerant of costumed white males, the Comedian goes to work for the police state.  The story begins with the Comedian's  mysterious murder (mysterious because his identity was supposedly secret), and examines its effects on the remaining heroes - most of whom are out of commission.  The Comedian's death provides both a mystery and a useful device for the surviving heroes to examine where their lives and their world went wrong.  (In the world of \\"Watchmen\\", advances in American technology allow for a world that can be safer and cleaner, but isn't; the advent of the superhero allows for a world that is safer and more respectful of the law, but doesn't; America's monopoly on superpower should make it more secure, instead, Nixon is still president when the novel begins, and the USSR and the US are set to go to war again).  Among the heroes is \\"Ozymandias\\", a genius who patterns himself after Alexander the Great; \\"Night-Owl\\" who relies on his own gadgetry and his knowledge of birds to fight crime; \\"Dr. Manhattan\\", a scientist altered by a nuclear experiment into a super-powered god for whom walls of time (and clothing) mean nothing; and darkest of all, Rorschach, a vigilante of few words whose mask conceals a reservoir fueled by violence.<br />Moore and Gibbons' story patterns these heroes on movie stars.  Promising in their youth, when crime is simple and most of the crooks wentbad simply to get in on the heroes' action, the first generation quickly turns to seed, and then turns on each other with their memoirs.  Life is hardly better for the arch-criminals, including an evil magician slowly dying of a cancer and loneliness.<br />\\"Watchmen\\" is a huge story - it was the story of the late 1980's (before the success of \\"Ninja Turtles\\" fueled a run on independent comics).  There was talk of a movie, and fans debated who should be cast.  In the end, it was for naught - the guys who scripted \\"Lord of the Rings\\" would have had their hands full trying to turn this complex story into a script.  \\"Watchmen\\" cuts across timelines to revisit many of the same moments again and again, creating multiple subplots that skew these moments in different ways (one key moment is the meeting between the Comedian and Lori Jupiter, the daughter of a former fellow hero.  We relive that instant both before and after learning of how the Comedian had raped Lori's mother).  \\"Watchmen\\" though dark, has a hidden bright side.  Because the past, present and future are all the same to Dr. Manhattan, he sees no point to trying to prevent an inevitable nuclear holocaust, yet even he is ultimately won over by the random miracles in which life is created and survived (there's got to be some reason why life manages to mature from a microscopic egg with everything going against it, and if we can't find out what that reason is, it's still worth protecting.)<br />Nowadays, it's fun to read because it's so obviously 1980's - its obsession with Vietnam (we didn't lose), Nixon, confrontation with the soviets and the end of western civilization make it less a story than a Time-Life infomercial.  Also, while revolutionary at the time, the deconstruction of heroes and heroism is hardly reason to be shocked today.  (The series debuted amid the \\"Iran-Contra\\" scandal, as well as after a surfeit of scandals among \\"televangelists\\", which eroded whatever popular trust in established figures Americans preserved after Watergate).  Ours is the generation of anti-heroes, Keyzer Soze, Clinton, Bush, Columbus and political correctness, Clint Eastwood in \\"Unforgiven\\" - we're much to smart to root for a bunch of old white males in masks.<br />Still, \\"Watchmen\\" is intricate and compelling.  You could probably read it in one sitting, though I prefer to space it out over a month - you're less likely to skim over its many intricacies.
006016848X|3.0|I liked what it was trying to tell you.  But I feel like he could have done an excellent job summing it up in 20 pages... or less.<br />He mentions at the end that you need to hear something 200 times before you really learn it.  Well, it seems like everything is repeated more than that.  After getting through half of it I found myself getting aggrivated with its redundancy.<br />If you are the type of person who does not like being told to do something several dozen times (hem, hem... I'm sure that is most men) then don't buy this book unless you run across some cliff-notes or something.<br />If I were to advise John Gray I would have written two editions.  The Venutian edition would be thick explaining men and their caves to women while the Martian version would be thinner, to the point, and only repeat things two or three times on women and their wells.<br />Other than that, I thought this book was really good and contained a lot of useful information that I have used and will continue to use to communicate with my wife and other Venutians in my life.
B0000640VO|3.0|This film is interesting, and really unusual, you loose all you references when you start seeing it, the negative point about it is that it is a bit psychadelic, you don't really understand what is happening, you ar taken in to a irrealistic and ideal world, where everything is good.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Here is some advice for any Band, Group, Singer, or Performer thinking about putting together a concert DVD. Watch \\"Queen: Live At Wembley Stadium\\" first as a reference DVD! Probably the best covered concert I have ever viewed and considering the date of the concert, 1986, the video and sound are as good as anything produced today.<br />The quality is apparent when viewing the bonus material. The interviews with Gavin Taylor (Director) and Gerry Sickells (Tour Manager) shows the foresight in camera, sound, and stage development; no less than 16 cameras were used (I'm told your average concert uses 9 cameras). You almost feel they knew this would one day be put on DVD, which didn't even exist then. The Bonus material is rich as well. There are multi angle shots for several of the sets, including \\"Under Pressure\\". Behind-the-scene material, rehearsal sets, interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor, and a backstage documentary.<br />My system does not support DTS. However, watching it with my Dolby/THX certified system the sound was crisp, clean, and well balanced. I can just imagine how well DTS would sound. John's bass sounds just as good as Brian's acoustic solos and Freddie's voice is as good as ever with clean backup performances by Roger. I felt as if I was at the concert itself. With the crowd cheering and ambient sounds in my surround speakers and the explosive music and vocals coming from all around, I got Goosebumps!<br />The concert itself is Queen at their best. They perform 28 songs and cover their career up to that point.  With classics like \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\", and \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" they also include music from their roots like \\"Tie your mother down\\", \\"Seven Seas Of Rhye\\" and great renditions of \\"Big Spender\\" and \\"Tutti Frutti\\". The energy of the band never falters either. They have the same energy from the opening with \\"One Vision\\" to their finale \\"God Save the Queen\\".<br />Do I have anything negative to add? Yes. Queen did not perform more of my favorites like \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"Spread Your Wings\\", \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", or \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\". But hey, They're not machines.<br />Get this DVD!

B00005JLYU|3.0|I just returned from watching the extremely highly anticipated (2nd highest anticipated film of the year behind October 10th's Kill Bill) Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.  As high as my anticipation was, I was bound to be slightly dissapointed, yet I seemed it unlikely, but boy was I wrong, I was very dissapointed.  The film is still curculating through my head and I'm still wondering if I really even liked the film that much at all.  Of course, I'll be watching it several more times to see how it holds up, but theres no way I'm beating my viewings of the first film (23 times in the theater)  These are some of the things I disliked about the film....<BR>Bernie Mac-  I love Bernie, he is very funny and a lot of fun to watch.....but, he's gotta stop getting these kinda roles, Murrey's Bosley was a very well made character, he felt 2 dimensional, Bernie's Bosley (the Bosley's are brothers, somehow) is your average 1 dimensional token black guy, with a bunch of one liners that can usually be funny, but it doesn't make the character, Bernie is always getting garbage roles, for once I thought it would be different here, but it wasn't.<BR>John Cleese-  John is also a very funny man, but in Angels he plays the father to the most unlikely angel, you guessed it (maybe) Lucy Lui, John is an englishman, Lucy is asian, what were they thinking?<BR>Drew Barrymore-  There was so much fun with the Dylan character in the first film, but this time around shes all mopey and sad most of the time, lessening the fun.<BR>Luke Wilson-  I'm all about Natalie having a man, and the relationship made many scenes in the first film so much fun, but this time around Luke's character is pretty much pointless.<BR>the action-  I'm not saying I hated the action scenes, but none of them held the intensity and excitement that the first one provided even to this day, I love the action in the original.  They try every way to get the angels in as many action settings and outfits as possible, but it gets excessive and a little out of hand.  Although, I don't criticize the unrealness of the scenes, because they do get extremely unreal, and I expected that.<BR>the story-  ....or lack of, which is weird cause woman just kicking butt for no reason seems to sound damn good, but I'm not saying there was no story, they kicked butt for reasons, but the story was......I really don't know how to describe it, of course there was a story but it wasn't even remotely close to the story in the original.<BR>Demi Moore-  Sure, she was hotter than ever before, but being hot doesn't increase your acting abilities, and her bad acting really showed, which is weird because usually that doesn't bother me, but it was so obvious that it did this time.<BR>the opening-  the first films opening is hard to top, but I was so sure they were gonna do it, but just like the rest of the film, very dissapointed.<BR> <BR>Finally, the thing about the film that really [*] me off....Crispin Glover-  Creepy Thin Man is so mysterious, and such a great character, I was awaiting his arrival with much enthusiasm, SPOILER AHEAD.....Skip  paragraph if you don't wanna know, he first showed up in a dirt bike race with a helmet on, I knew it was him right away, later you actually get some history of the character, including a first name, then came the best part in the film, during a fight of a rooftop towards the end, Thin Man comes to the rescue, which results into the funniest scene, after kissing,  both Dylan and Thin Man have strands of each others hair in thier hands, Thin smells hers, then Dylan very awkwardly smells his.......then.......remember stop reading if you don't wanna know...........last chance...........okay, I warned you, Thin Man gets a swords (I believe his) through the heart from the back, since they are on an edge of a rooftop this makes him very far to his death.........sorry, believe me, I felt bad too, up to that point it wasnt as good as the first, but at least it was somewhat fun, and it didnt take itself too seriously, but killing Thin Man was a wrong move, and it really bothered me.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I've been listening to Moby for years now, and enjoy this CD as much as his past CD's (minus a couple &quot;rabit trails&quot; he took).  Bringing in all new sounds to a dance beat really makes this CD sound creative and complex yet still catchy and &quot;pop-like&quot;.  Obviously Moby is maturing into a great writer, and by taking on new instruments and sounds, I am eager to see his future in the music industry.  Pop-rock-electronica-club and orchestral/soundtrack.
B00009V7RF|3.0|I think hip hop is good.  This cd is good. Black Eyed Peas are good. Their other albums are gooder.
B000099T2L|4.0|I actually went out and purchased the album the day that it came out. I'm not really a DC fan and I hadn't particularly cared for Beyonce at all, but I have to admit that she is a very talented singer. This album shows how versitile she is; each song has its own vibe, but it still flows pretty well. If i had to pick songs that she could have left off though it would be &quot;That's how you like it&quot; with Jay-Z and the one about her father. I think that people could have done without that extended thank you (even if it is sweet). My favorite tacks have to be &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, and &quot;Speechless.&quot; I also think she would have done better by leaving &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; alone; i wasn't quite loving this version-the original was a hit though!
B00009V7RF|3.0|BEP album is nice.  So is Ice Cream.  Both BEP album and ice cream are nice.
B000099T2L|5.0|I don't think Beyonce could have come out with a better cd to set her apart from Destiny's child to emerge as a spectacular solo album....well at least i think. When you listen you can tell she made a strict effort to make sure it did not sound like another Destiny's Child album.  Obviously \\"Crazy In Love\\" is a VERY catchy, radio-friendly song that you would strangle someone just to get the hook out of your head, but you learn the depths of her as an artist/songwriter and becoming a women in the seductive and sexy \\"Speechless\\", and the old-school groove of \\"Be With You\\". You also need to keep in mind that Beyonce is an executive producer on the Cd and wrote/co-wrote almost the entire album.  \\"Baby Boy\\" the 3rd track on the album is DEFINITELY a certified hit single and great club song. \\"Hip Hop Star\\" is a very different kind of song, not one of my favorites but it has it's own type of funky offbeat upbeat vibe. \\"Signs\\" a Missy Elliot collaboration is a nice slow groove song....signature Missy and very creatively written. \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" the album's title track is also wonderfully written. Even though it can be heard on Destiny's Child \\"Survivor\\" album and is pretty much just a remixed version of the DC version, it STILL makes you feel the heart and emotion she poured into writing that song. You can definitely hear that she FEELS this song in her voice.  I could comment on EVERY song but the one I think needs to made known more than any other is the soft yet hard \\"Yes\\". Beyonce is taking a stand against a new companion tryin to get into her pants before she's ready. Could very well be a new way to look at pop music or create yet another new blended genre of music all its own. Here's my rating for all of the songs...<br />1. \\"Crazy In Love\\"  - 8/10<BR>2. \\"Naughty Girl\\"   - 9/10<BR>3. \\"Baby Boy\\"       - 10/10<BR>4. \\"Hip Hop Star\\"   - 7/10<BR>5. \\"Be With You\\"    - 8/10<BR>6. \\"Me, Myself And I\\" - 8/10<BR>7. \\"Yes\\"              - 10/10<BR>8. \\"Signs\\"            - 9/10<BR>9. \\"Speechless\\"       - 9/10<BR>10. \\"That's How You Like It\\" - 8/10<BR>11. \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" - 7/10<BR>12. \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" - 10/10<BR>13. Interlude<BR>14. Gift From Virgo\\"  - 8/10    <BR>15. Hidden Track - nice dedication to \\"Daddy\\".
B000089RVX|5.0|The best cd just to rock out to with your friends, and it also has really good slow songs to take things down a little bit.
6305127638|5.0|This was the best of all the Star Trek movies ever made, the very best.  The plot was superb, the characterization excellent (with one exception, discussed below), the action compelling and the visual presentation magnificent.  Our TNG crew again performed with distinction, revealing humanity's entire range of characteristics from weakness to triumph.  Captain Picard, the character first among equals in this film, prevailed over the Borg, extracting revenge for his assimilation years before.  The Borg Queen was, in all of her grotesque-ness, peculiarly seductive -- even to a guy just watching the DVD.  I hope everyone involved with this film had a great deal of fun working on it, because their results in the Star Trek genre are unsurpassed.<br />The only, only tiny difficulty with this movie -- small but eminently agonizing -- was that Wesley Crusher was not on hand to step in at some point, discover some problem/solution that all of the adults had completely failed to notice, and save the Federation from total annihilation (once again).
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm not real big on fancy schmancy reviews, but here is my take on Radiohead albums<br />Pablo Honey - Very Good<BR>Bends - Awesome<BR>OK Computer - Wow<BR>Kid A - What the??? I miss OK Computer.<BR>Amnesiac - Didn't even bother to check it out<BR>Hail To The Thief - Wow again<br />IOW, for those of you who, like me, were disenchanted by the turn Kid A and Amnesiac took, it's time to return to the fold. This album is awesome.
B0000024SI|4.0|This album was the first all electric Dylan album, and I think of it as the rough cut of Blonde on Blonde. It has a handful of gems, and no filler, which was rare in the 60's except to The Beatles and a handful of others. Besides &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, the other gems are &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; &quot;It Takes A Lot to Laugh...&quot; and &quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot;, which is probably my favorite song on here. Not too far behind are &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of A Thin Man&quot;. Overall I give it 4 stars because it doesn't have enough classic material to be 5, but it is still a great album and a must have for fans of folk-blues music.
B000000WJZ|5.0|i am not a big fan of modern music (modern being post-1990) but this album is truly one of the standouts of the decade. it was my &quot;first&quot; favorite album (i was only 14 when i first heard it), and despite my discoveries of zeppelin, fleetwood mac, the eagles, etc, it remains in my top 10. if youre trying to decide between buying mellon collie and this one, let me give you some advice. first of all, mellon collie is a great set--but it is a double album, it costs more and is more to get through. second of all, mellon collie can be a real downer (they dont call it mellon collie for nothing). only get it if youre in the mood for something really deep and really sad. siamese dream, on the other hand, is a bit more detached--it still has the same tragic sense of mellon collie, but also has a bit of a sense of humor, a more lyrical quality to it. overall, a better value. that said, enjoy!
B00008S2VG|4.0|I like Madonna's early work the best and I admit I hated the album when I bought it.  After a week of hating myself for wasting [$$$] I put the cd on and listened to it again.  It was not that bad.....the more you listen to it from start to finnish the better it gets.  It is a very personal album and under all the robot vocals and beeps and quirks the songs are very deep.  Madonna's voice (on the songs like easy ride with nothing added to it) is the strongest it has been.  So even if you hate it at first give it a shot, you may like it....I still hope the Madonna goes back to making fun, upbeat, and just great songs like all those on the \\"Immaculate Collection\\"
B00003CXSP|3.0|I would just like to say that I enjoyed this movie, but only until I read the book. Harris is a master and the book was creepy yet compelling but this movie does the book no justice. not to mention the terrible &quot;Hollywood&quot; friendly ending. Yes it's hard not to love watching Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal the cannibal, and I did enjoy him telling Gary Oldman to cut his face off, but it still wasn't good enough. If you plan only to see the movie then you are missing out. I strongly suggest that you run out and get the book today. You won't regret it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|A few years ago I had the opportunity to speak personally with Robert Urich about his role as ill-fated Jake Spoon in the epic western Lonesome Dove.  Simply put, he said that it was \\"the most fun I have ever had making a movie.  Think of it.  Riding and shooting every day with two of the greatest western stars ever: Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones! I won't have that much fun ever again!\\"  I am sure that he could have gone on for hours but, unfortunately, time would not permit.  The look on his face and the light in his eyes said it all. Tragically Urich passed away a year or two thereafter.<br />The legend and the story live on in the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Larry McMurty and in this faithful video depiction of the classic story.<br />A star-studded cast, headed by Duvall, Jones and Urich, along with one of the most beautiful western soundtracks ever composed make Lonesome Dove a viewing experience that you will enjoy time and again.

0451167716|5.0|In case you've just arrived from Mars, this is the story of an organized crime family in 1940s New York, coupled with flashbacks and other expository information that weaves rich plots and scenarios.  The character and tale development is absolutely riveting.<br />And it's a somewhat sympathetic presentation of mob family life, told fairly objectively -- which leaves the reader to draw his/her own conclusions about these sorts of people.  Their lifestyle arose in Italy, when the government was so corrupt that folks turned to powerful/wealthy families for assistance in obtaining justice.  In time, and following migration to other countries, the rule of law expanded -- but these powerful families did not go away.  They continued strong-arming others as they'd been doing, shaking down merchants and extorting money from businesses, skimming income from gambling and prostitution operations.  Still retaining the trappings of honor, such as fine clothing, jewelry, housing and autos, they reveal themselves to be plain old thieves and murderers, worthy of nothing but contempt and many years in prison.  Young readers might think it's a \\"neat\\" lifestyle -- hey, nobody bosses ME around -- but it's actually just plain old crime, and the perpetrators are all completely despicable.  <br />But again, it's a terrific story.  Enjoy!
0066620996|5.0|The focus of this book is to identify the factors and behaviors that have a very high correlation to outstanding business success measured by sustained, long term stock returns much higher than comparable companies. Great CEOs and managers understand how to do this, but to a significant extent, their methods are learned by trial and error, and the quality of such a leader depends on the number of these they have experienced.  In this book, Collins lucidly describes surprisingly simple, sometimes counterintuitive findings that are explicitly correlated with corporate success.<br />The clear descriptions of methodology Collins undertook and the thoroughness and avoidance of prebias they showed are exemplary on their own. Facts would be discussed among the research group until a clear consensus emerged about the theory; then the theory back-tested and accepted only if it had a very high correlation with companies that succeeded and a low (or negative) correlation with the comparable companies that did not. The depth of analysis is outstanding; the lack of bias and the aversion to mold the facts to fit the theory or let the high filtering standards lapse are notable in their own right. In other words, the conclusions are believable because they are based on an outstanding level of analysis and thorough, impartial, critical filtering.<br />And what conclusions they are! Is the great CEO the great showman, the charismatic leader who pumps up the troops? No -- he defines a new \\"Level 5\\" leader type who doesn't make a lot of noise externally, but keeps an intense and clearly defined focus on results.  Often the great CEO of a great company was someone who didn't have the traditional qualifications for the job and who is to this day anonymous.<br />What about setting corporate strategy? Collins shows that it is not a useful goal on its own -- get a great team of people together and they'll figure out what the right thing to do is. Pay them a lot? No correlation to success. And on and on. I love it. Common sense maybe, but a kind that's been lost in the face of company PR events and insane compensation.<br />This book should help anyone who manages or hires or invests to sort through the complex issues of finding good people and companies who will be successful. Boards of Directors, hiring managers, interviewees and interviewers, investors will all benefit greatly from this book. Non-profit organizations will find virtually all the findings in this book just as useful as for-profits. After reading this book, my approaches to the next steps in my career and to my own investing strategies changed overnight.
B000002V0Q|4.0|\\"Countdown To Extinction\\" is Megadeth's entrance to the mainstream. The tracks are slower and much more simplistic than their masterpiece \\"Rust In Peace\\" that came out two years earlier. This album has its high points,but some songs should have just been left out because they are pretty bad. Here is a rundown of all the songs:<br />1)\\"Skin O' My Teeth\\": The album starts of well with Skin O' My Teeth. It is a very good song, melodic, but raw. It has a good solo and lyrics about failed suicide attempts. Has a cool drum intro. My favorite on the album along with \\"Symphony Of Destruction.\\" 10/10<br />2)\\"Symphony Of Destruction\\": Megadeth's biggest hit. It has a good verse and chorus, and cool lyrics. Very simple, but very good. The solo is great. 10/10<br />3)\\"Architecture Of Agression\\": The heaviest track on the album, very cool riffs and a good chorus. Not as good as the first two, but this is still worth listening to. 8/10<br />4)\\"Forclosure Of A Dream\\": The song begins with a soft intro and verse. It builds up at the chorus and contains some great soloing by Dave and Marty. 8/10<br />5)\\"Sweating Bullets\\": The WORST Megadeth song EVER. Horrible lyrics with bad vocals. Skip it. 0/10<br />6)\\"This Was My Life\\": The album picks up again here. A melodic rocker with good lyrics. I believe it is about capital punishment. 8/10<br />7)\\"Countdown To Extinction\\": Another good tune. Very melodic, with some great bass lines. The lyrics are nothing special, but this is a great song. 8/10<br />8)\\"High Speed Dirt\\": A song about skydiving. Very bland with dumb lyrics. It does contain good leads by Dave and Marty, especially the blues solo, but it does not really save this track. 3/10<br />9)\\"Psychotron\\": Another stupid song with bad lyrics and bad vocals. \\"Part bionic, and organic, not a cyborg, call him Psychotron.\\" Please. 2/10<br />10)\\"Captive Honour\\": It doesn't get much better. Starts off as a ballad, and then it becomes a stupid courtroom scene. It has some good solos by Dave and Marty, but like High Speed Dirt, it can not save this song. 2/10<br />11)\\"Ashes In Your Mouth\\": It gets better! A great song with more awesome solos by Dave and Marty. A good way to close the album. 8/10<br />Overall, this is a pretty good album, but there are some pretty bad songs. You should still buy the album, the good songs are simply excellent. Megadeth's next album \\"Youthanasia\\" is a bit better than this album.
B000099T2L|3.0|Overall, the cd is alright, there's a couple stand out good, strong songs. But there are a few, that are just stupid! I'm very disappointed with &quot;signs&quot; usually, Missy never misses, but she missed big time here. this song has got to be the worst on the album. Then the duet with Luther VAndross is boring; it sounds like it came out 6 years ago.<BR>I liked &quot;speechless&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, alot. I think the sing &quot;crazy in love&quot; gives the buyer a wrong impression, because there is nothing else on the cd like it, and that was what i wanted, something else like the single. well youarent going to get it if thats what youre looking for
B000099T2L|5.0|This is a very good album, beyonce' is an excellent artist, her style is like no otha. All her songs are da bomb and different. I look forward to seeing another album from her and Destiny's Child. My fav. from this album are Crazy in love, Baby Boy,Be with you just basically almost the whole album it's probably three songs that i don't care for. BUT TRUSTS ITS AN ALBUM TO BUY AND YOU WILL ENJOY! GET 'UM BEYONCE'.
1552091090|5.0|just the SWEETEST book...we turned the refrain into a song...this, goodnight moon, and the runaway bunny are my 3 favorite memories of reading to my 4 kids when they were very small...must haves!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is hands down the best female singer there today. And she proves it in Dangerously in Love. She mixes her sassy southern style with a funky attitude, fresh talent, and sexy class and it makes her music as well as her irresistable. She is is gorgeous and is not a studio singer. I've seen her in concert and was you see is what you get, which is plenty. As soon as i herd the first song I knew it was a rap and she was going to just raise the bar for R&B and pop singers. The cd is the type that you can listen from begining to end and not want to skip over osme tracks. If you like crazy in love you will like the rest of the cd. She has a littlwe of pop hip hop r$b and  rap enough to keep everyone satisfied. She has grat ballads. This girl has vocal range. If you are a true fan youy will notice that dangerously in love (name of a song also) from the suvivor is also on this cd. This is my fav!!!! This cd has platnium status and will be a promising summer, must have cd. I listen to this cd all the time it has not left my cd player yet. I think that the the colabos that she has is the perfect amount that keeps every song fresh and new. Its not to much like some cd where the cd dosn't seem like hers. The son how you like it with jay-z is bound to be another hit. The song with luther vandros called the closer i get to you is also on his cd. She works with sean paul and big boi form out cast also on some song with serious beats. She also wokrs with missy on a song called signs. Missy has done it again!! Byonce has grown so much nad ha sben through s much. She has made a voice for her self and shown that she has got what it takes to be the best. GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!! ITS THST FIRE!!!!!!!!
014118213X|5.0|Howard's End can be read again and again and again - and the reader comes away with something fresh each time. Like all of Forster's tales, it's concerned with the deep and petty differences in the various classes of English society, as well as economics and education, and how these issues come to affect personal relationships. Set in the early 20th century, Howard's End follows the two Schlegel sisters. Margaret, the elder, rather suddenly finds herself engaged, then married to Mr. Wilcox, a much older widower, a rather superficial and bombastic English gentleman. Meanwhile, her sister, Helen, becomes involved in politics, good works, and the attempted salvation of Leonard Bast, an impoverished clerk and intellectual. The ownership of Howard's End, the country estate of the late Mrs. Wilcox, becomes central to the story; the wrangling this bequest causes is a metaphor for the class struggles that weave like tangled braids throughout the whole of the book. The tragedy chronicled in the book is seen to have resulted from chance encounters, foolish pride, and petty misunderstandings.<BR>A deeply sad and beautiful book.
B000099T2L|3.0|This is a good CD. The 1st song is good, but the tempo fades after that. I think it is a good CD, but I expected more. If you like Beyonce though, I think you'll still enjoy it.
B00000I8BX|4.0|In my personal oppinion, Obsolete fits perfectly inbetween Demanufacture and Digimortal. Both representing different extremes(Demanufacture being closer to where they started as more death metal inflected and Digimortal showing the band becoming more industrial and almost more mainstream). Inbetween those two albums sits Obsolete, which may not be there most technical or experimental, but certainly their most consistant.<br />When I think of Fear Factory, I think of drive. All of their songs are driven by different elements(be it vocals and lyrics, drums, guitar whatever). Unlike say, Disturbed, FF always feels like they are being proppled forward creating a unsupressable energy. Everything fits with in the band's context and never feels out of place. Some would say that maybe more solos or more drum fills should round out Fear Factory's sound. I disagree. I think solos or drum fills would completely tear away what makes Fear Factory, Fear Factory: a tight, almost mechanized metal machine.<br />There sound is so listless and agressive that by the time Resurrection comes into play, the listener finally feels like they can can take a breather. Save Timelessness and the aforementioned Ressurrection, the rest of the tracks are like being pummeled with heavy machinery for almost an hour. I think perhaps that might be Obsolete's only down fall. Its relies too heavily on their formula and only steps out and takes a few chances only after the CD is over(though the toned down Decent in the middle of the album is nice change of pace from songs like Freedom or Fire or Securitron). The other complaint that I have is that the tracks following Cars sort destroy the albums momentum and are generally not necessary listening. However for the first 11 tracks of Fear Factory's Obsolete, people will be treated to 100% unadultrated energy. Excellent stuff.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Great album, my favorite songs would include roulette dares, Drunkship Of Lanterns, cicatriz esp, and televators, Cedric, the lead singer, voice is a lot different sounding from At the Drive In, and the effects on his voice are great. This and Hail to the Theif are the two best albums of the year.
B000083E79|5.0|All that I can say about The Very Best Of Cher is that it is absolutely flawless in every way and you must buy it!!
B000066NW0|5.0|I love avril so much, she's changed the pop charts into more of a rock sense of music! Avril is like the best person for anyone to look up to! Some ppl say that she is a poser, well, she's not, she never said that she was punk, and she does play guitar a little bit, if she didn't then she wouldn't use it in her videos!

B000002LEE|2.0|There's nothing all that great on this record, except for perhaps &quot;Jane Says,&quot; which is a classic song for all time.  Otherwise, I find these tunes kind of dull and screechy, due to Jane's voice.<br />Their one in 1990 was better, but what do I really know?
B000021YQV|2.0|System of a Down's unusual interpretation of modern metal has one them credit amongst metalheads searching for something different. I, myself, would love to find something out there that's totally different (I.e, another Tool vs Korn),  but this just isn't it. System of a Down's weak sophomore release just doesn't do it. It lacks any sign of maturity music-wise. Lyrical content has grown a little, as eveident on Forest and Deer Dance. But this lacks anything that would musically satisfy someone with an ear for real metal...
B00005JLYU|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen this year! And it is also one of Cameron Diaz's best movies!<BR>The special effects are impressing, and not like in the first movie, the story is original and highly interessing. The actresses are fabulous, especially Cameron Diaz (as usual). I liked it so much I saw it twice in a row! Really an outcomming movie! GO SEE IT!
B000069AUI|4.0|In my eyes, 'Parachutes' was an amazing album. It was a melancholy ode to angst, heartbreak, and loss; each song similar enough to make a coherent, complete album but different enough to be able to identify each track. However, while this worked for the first album, it was obvious that the boys couldn't repeat the same theme again, or else they'd become formulaic and would lose the due praise they had received. And so Coldplay took their time, worked and reworked their songs, and released their second album, 'A Rush of Blood to the Head.'<BR>With their new CD, Coldplay feign from the angst of 'Parachutes' to something louder, livilier, and far more complex. Lyrically, Coldplay has evolved from &quot;ignored longing&quot; as seen seen in 'Shiver' and 'Yellow' to a &quot;more experienced&quot; lover, trying to work out his turbulent relationship, rather then write about his obsession with a girl in his diary. The songs are definately more lively, as they incorporate more instruments, and are generally played louder then before, but in an &quot;understanding tune&quot; rather then a &quot;brooding one&quot; to accompany the lyrics of the same nature.<BR>This new style produces many musical gems that far surpass past songs. &quot;Green Eyes,&quot; &quot;In My Place,&quot; &quot;The Scientist,&quot; &quot;Warning Sign&quot; and the title track are amazing tracks, certainly some of the best songs of the past few years. However, this does not mean that Coldplay doesn't have some problems. It seems that they tried too many different ideas, and some songs do not fit in well with the rest of the album. The electronical, swirly tracks such as &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot; are throwaways in my opinion. Without them I think the CD would sound more coherent, and thus better. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; seems as if it could be a 'Parachutes' b-side, and muddles up the theme of the album. Instead of starting with a bang and ending with a bang, Coldplay has made a poor decision by including this &quot;aftermath&quot; piece, which doesn't seem to fit very well with any of the sounds, lyrics, or themes of the album. <BR>However, while Coldplay made a couple of bruises with 'A Rush,' I think we can forgive them. There may be three songs on the album that are sub-par, but the rest of the album is sensational. I think Coldplay is still searching to find a sound, and this album was in many ways an experiment with different styles become Coldplay's permanent sound. Coldplay showed us they were not burnouts, and proved this by changing their sound around and making a very good CD. I can only assume that their next effort will be their best one yet.
B00008DDXC|4.0|\\"Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets\\" is the proof that children's movies can be a)long and b)faithful to the source material.  The film is obviously made for fans of the book, and it follows the plot of the novel to a degree of exactitude that is rarely seen in Hollywood adaptations.  This is a testament to the good working relationship that is said to exist between book author J.K. Rowling and screenwriter Steve Cloves.  Working together they crafted a script that captures the adventure and wonder of the novel, and build on the already well-realized world created in the first film.<br />The plot details are familiar, boy wizard goes to wizard school, has his two best friends, has a nemesis, fights off evil, etc.  The best part about the second film is that the overly clunky exposition needed to set up the first film is no longer necessary, so the action starts almost immediately.  Director Chris Colombus shows range here that he has not shown since his early days as a director, and he is obviously good with children, as all three main child actors turn in top-notch permormances.  Daniel Radcliffe especially has improved his acting ability since the first film, while the solid work from Emma Watson as Hermoine and Rupert Grint as Ron continues.<br />The film is darker in tone and plot, as lives are threatened and murder discussed, but it is also contains better effects, funnier lines, and maintains the sense of wonder that the first film created.  The adult actors are also excellent, with another strong turn by Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape and  Robbie Coultrane keeps Hagrid interesting without becoming a charactaure.  The late Richard Harris also does a fine job as Prof. Dumbledore.<br />Especially good is Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, the self-obsessed Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Branagh sends up his own flamboyant image and gets a lot of laughs as the not as clever as he thinks Lockhart.<br />As said before the special effects here are far superior to the first film, probably because they used ILM.  Quidditch here seems less like the video game than it did in the first film, and Hogwarts itself seems more alive than before.  The production design is great, and the filmakers know when the setting should be dark or light.<br />As said, it's a long film, but it is never dull, and it should keep any child entertained.  The DVD also contains 19 deleted scenes, although only 2 or 3 are really intersting.  Documentaries and walk-throughs of classrooms ae included for the kids, and there is a pretty illuminating interview with JK Rowling and Steve Kloves, discussing the writing process.<br />All in all, this is a terrific DVD and film.  Anyone who loves the books or loves fantasy should pick it up.superior to the first film, probably because they used ILM.

B00005JLT5|3.0|The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.<br />What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as \\"Schindler's List\\" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of \\"sensitivity\\" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor.<br />The result is that unlike \\"Schindler's List\\" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a \\"tale of survival\\" or \\"one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music\\" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts.<br />Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, \\"The Pianist\\" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them.

0451526384|5.0|Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" accomplishes the feat of rewarding both extremely casual and deeper, more analytical readings. It certainly contains enough genuine insight into humanity, and social relationships in particular, to be considered a \\"serious\\" novel. But \\"Persuasion\\" defies the stereotype that accompanies this genre. Rather than being ponderous and solemn, it is instead a work of sheer joy to read. Readers are treated to a complex novel that reads like a summer beach book.<br />Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \\"Persuasion\\" is how it balances the depth and richness with pure entertainment. Anne, her sisters, her father, and of course Captain Wentworth, are all very complex and fully fleshed-out characters. At the same time, however, they are all delightful people to read about. Anne in particular is charming and compassionate. Austen's prose is wonderful; witty, intelligent, and clear. And the story itself, a tale of people in love, is universal in its appeal and yet never once becomes formulaic. The novel, then, is a fantastic success in every possible way. It provides the richness of great literature with the charm of the greatest writers. I can't recommend \\"Persuasion\\" highly enough.
055357342X|5.0|As a long-time reader of epic fantasy, I was pleased by the first book in this series and eagerly awaited the next installment. Now, five years and two books later, I'm practically salivating for the fourth. The aspects of these novels which thrill me most are the changing perspective and Mr. Martin's fearlessness. I've read all three novels twice, and I still don't know who to root for. I know who I WAS backing in the battle for the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, but Mr. Martin blindsided me on that one. I like being surprised in a genre that I love, but which seems to have become terribly formulaic.

B00006DEF9|5.0|I am obsessed with old movies, finding that the quality of acting in them far surpasses the quality of acting today. No words can really describe the power and magnitude of this film on both myself and the world.  This is not only the greatest musical ever made but also is the greatest film ever made.  It has an incredible story, fabulous music, out of this world dancing (eat your heart out Fred Astaire), and most importantly a cast that can never be topped. Gene Kelly was magnificint but Donald O'Connor, I feel steals the movie.  His quick wit,comedic timing and incredible dancing skills make him my all time favorite (and most underated) actor of all time.  Debbie Reynolds also gives a charming performance even though she is only 18 going on 19 years old.  The music numbers are fabulous, especially Donald's Make em' Laugh and Gene and Don's Moses Supposes.  They leave me speechless everytime I watch them.  I recommend that no lover of film or musicals lets this one slip through their fingers. I'm only 17 and I have seen this movie at least 1000 times (and I wish I we're kidding).  It's timeless and amazing.

B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay does a good job of writing songs that kind of take you on a musical journey.  Well-written, thoughtful lyrics combined with the lead's unique and amazingly versitile voice make a great combindation.  The only thing that bugs me is that sometimes the guitar gets a bit too gritty for the song.
B00009V7T2|5.0|even better than the new radiohead.<br />this follow-up to the &quot;tremulant&quot; ep is easily the strongest and freshest album of the year.  it is a solid hour of powerful, eclectic rock that has a style of its own, with salsa influences.<br />the band has done a wonderful job of mixing cedric's high, penetrating voice with omar's beautiful guitar work, the steady, fast-paced drumming of john theodore and ikey's key pounding.<br />each track has its own specific beauty.<br />track 1, &quot;son et lumiere,&quot; leads into the second track, &quot;inertiatic esp.&quot; the second song begins with an explosion of each instrument, of which vocals is very much a part.  it rises and falls in and out of this energetic tone, with sections of southwestern flavor, and the frequent unison between guitar and keys.<br />track 3,&quot;roulette dares (the haunt of),&quot; twists and turns around a vigorous chorus where cedric repeats the phrase, &quot;exoskeletal junction at the railroad delay.&quot;  beautiful!<br />track 4, &quot;tira me a las aranas&quot; is another interlude, which leads into track 5, &quot;drunkship of lanterns.&quot;  &quot;drunkship&quot; is a fast paced song that begins with an eclectic sound that contains heavy salsa effects.  the last few minutes of the song are pure energy as the guitar, drums and keys repeat themselves in dynamic fashio, but are only background noise for bixler zavara's vocals.<br />track 6, &quot;eriatarka,&quot; begins with a more mellow approach with toned down vocals that have a strange effect on them, which carries through the whole song. yet, it often erupts into a jumble of noise and wonder, and ends on the same note.<br />track 7, &quot;cicatriz,&quot; is a 12 minute long marvel.  it begins with pervasive drumming and guitar/bass riffs.  the song, like the others, rises and falls, but always returns back to this steady beat, which is practically addicting.  the middle of the song lulls for a while and nearly goes to sleep,before slowly building in an &quot;only in dreams&quot; weezeresque fashion and returning to finish in the same manner that it started in.<br />track 8, &quot;this apparatus must be unearthed,&quot; is the shortest song, disappointedly coming in at just under 5 minutes.  the vocals in this song have an effect that is slightly similar to those in &quot;eriatarka,&quot; and is driven by the bass line as the guitar bounces around in the background.<br />track 9, &quot;televators,&quot; is the softest of all the songs, and does not have all of the rise and falls of the other songs.  they lyrics are the clearest in this song, which shoes the wonderful experimentation that the sounds of the words creates.  the addition of the tabla drums near the middle of the song create a pleasing effect as well.<br />the final track, &quot;take the veil cerpin taxt&quot; has another forceful chorus that is somewhat similar to that in &quot;roulette dares.&quot;  the eclectic guitar work is the feature of the song, as the song changes paces and tone midway through and ends in much different fashion than that in which it began.<br />the cd depicts the hypothetical journey of a former friend of the band, who was in a coma before he commited suicide.   the songs that compose this journey are strangely fresh, strong and beautiful at the same time, as time becomes irrelevant and every sense becomes distorted.<br />it is quite easily the best album of the year, and coming in at just around an hour of music, it is well worth buying.

B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller was on my black list.  After seeing him in &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums,&quot; I was convinced the smarmy role he played was too effortless not to reflect the real life Ben Stiller. Either I was wrong, or Ben Stiller is also dumb as a rock, funny as Mike Meyers, poignant as Shirley Temple in the &quot;Little Colonel,&quot; and The Handsomest Male Model in the World. I am left with the conclusion Ben Stiller can make you believe in whatever face he cares to present.  All the credit (or blame) for &quot;Zoolander&quot; belongs to Ben who wrote, produced, acted and directed.<br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the #1 Male Model in the World and has been for four years. But we all know how fickle the fashion industry is.  DZ is threatened by the newest boy on the block, equally dumb Hansel (Owen Wilson, wonderful as always), and then it transpires that Evil Forces are at work. The plot is impossible, so just enjoy the ride.  Celebrity cameos abound. Caught a glimpse of Gary Shandling looking pained for Derek at the &quot;walk-off&quot; between he and Hansel.  David Duchovny has a marvelous scene as an over-the-hill &quot;hand&quot; model (hands encased in transparent protective plastic bubbles), and Jon Voight as coal miner Pappy Zoolander.  To see Jon Voight with the same punky hair as Ben Stiller is a treat.<br />&quot;Zoolander&quot; either grabs you or it doesn't.  I was enchanted with Derek and his fashion smarts coupled with great innocence and sweetness. Stiller's zaniness and intensity don't let up for a minute in this outré outing.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer

B000006IUQ|5.0|The score, photography, direction, screenplay and the marvelous interaction between Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins all deserve high praise.  It says much for the power of Baldwin and Hopkin's performances that the magnificent bear, Big Bart, did not steal every scene in which he appeared.<br />Billionaire intellectual, mildly paranoid Hopkins accompanies his trophy wife played by super model Elle MacPherson to a photo shoot in the Alaskan wilderness.  The always faintly menacing Alec Baldwin is a trendy, sophisticated fashion photographer who has more than a passing interest in Ms. MacPherson.  Hopkins reluctantly agrees to accompany Baldwin on a search for an elusive native trapper who Baldwin thinks will be an ideal photo subject. The plane goes down (in a jarringly effective scene).  Three survive, but on their first night the weakest of their party is horrifyingly mauled and taken away by a giant Kodiak bear.  Baldwin and Hopkins must make their way out of the wilderness with the terrifying knowledge that the bear is stalking them.  Hopkins is a wonderfully effective survivor and Baldwin shows a toughness and perseverance that belies his sophisticated image. Will the bear triumph? Will they get out alive? Are Baldwin and Hopkins ultimately partners or deadly adversaries? <br />Thanks to David Mamet, the screenplay has depth and is probably full of deeper meanings that whizzed right by me. Lee Tamahori's fine direction lifted the film from a merely grand adventure saga to an absorbing study of two men and their inner beings. The script or the interactions never bored me.  There is one fine scene setup that alone was worth the price of admission to me.  Hopkins and Baldwin are peering over a fallen log desperately trying to ascertain the location of the bear.  Only their upper faces are showing.  Hopkins china blue eyes display enormous depth and intelligence while Baldwin's icy blues convey complete kill or be killed intensity.  I think reviewers have been unjust to Ms. MacPherson's contribution.  I believe she delivered just what she was supposed to: a beauty who was graceful, charming and perhaps a little shallow.<br />This film is about as perfect as it can be.  The only flaw is a very disappointing DVD with no extras.  Hopefully, another edition will come out.  Anthony Hopkins is always marvelously articulate about his roles; it would be a treat to hear a few words from him.  Outtakes on Big Bart's scenes would be priceless.  I advise waiting for new edition before purchasing the DVD, but by all means, rent this one!  In spite of its totally unimaginative title, it is one of the great films of the decade.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer

B00003CY5J|4.0|Yes, the plot is familiar, BUT this one has three-generations of stellar actors: De Niro, Brando, and Norton who all deliver blue-ribbon performances.<br />World-weary safecracker De Niro agrees to one last job for old pal Brando's sake who is in a bind with the highly dangerous local crime syndicate.  The &quot;inside&quot; man is young, untested Ed Norton, a janitor at the Montreal Customs House where a priceless scepter is being stored. De Niro is tempted by the potential six million dollar payoff so he can retire to just being the owner of a jazz club.  The setup is complicated, the execution nerve wracking and the conclusion has a marvelous twist.<br />Brando as the opulently wealthy infallible set up man is wonderfully clever in his role.  To me, the chemistry between he and Norton was stronger and better balanced than between Brando and De Niro.  Always a danger when performing with Brando, De Niro seemed to fade a little when Brando was in the scene.  Norton is flat out brilliant as an icy young criminal.  He convinces his coworkers at the Customs House, he is a harmless, slightly palsied and retarded youth.  In this guise, he is lovably cheerful and guileless, a beautiful contrast to the cold, cynical crook that lies beneath.  De Niro gets a workout having to carry out the incredibly complex robbery where the tension level goes through the roof. Angela Bassett does what she can in a somewhat stereotyped role as De Niro's girlfriend.<br />This would be a 5-star caper movie except it has 2nd act troubles.  It sags a little in the middle and wanders off course.  When it finally gets to the nuts and bolts of the actual robbery, the film is gripping and tension is unremitting ably assisted by a fine musical score.  Don't miss it; the movie stands on its own.  Brando delivers not just a cameo or a walk-through for a paycheck, but a fine thinking performance. (How does he always make it seem so effortless?) De Niro is fine and gritty, if a little subdued and Norton is superb.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I am one of those conservative opera-goers that enjoy operas being produced in 'traditional stagings'. So this production should have appealed to me. <br />Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed by what I see, as the performance is quite lifeless. I suppose the stage director is to blame, for he has failed to ignite much fire and passion on the stage despite all those high drama inherent to the work. <br />This is not helped by the indifferent acting and singing of the cast. I admire the Met's orchestra, though, who is captured here on top form. Yet, Levine's ponderous musical direction is not at all to my taste. <br />I can therefore only give this set a qualified welcome.

B00006LSM3|4.0|When you read reviewers talk about this album as if it were some sad farewell by someone riding off into the sunset, you just have to ask, what album were they listening to? If George hadn't passed away, the joy and positive vibes that permeate this album would have had reviewers chiming,\\"Here comes the sun!\\" The beautiful Marwa Blues is the only tune that could be called melancholy, but no more so than My Sweet Lord or Something. No, this is no Requiem; Brainwashed is a Gloria in Excelcis to life.

B000063JDE|5.0|It's been called everything - kinky, creepy, disturbing, erotic. Call it what you want, but don't deny that director David Lynch's twisted journey into the dark side of American suburbia remains a landmark in cinema history - not to mention the scariest movie ever made. The plot itself isn't much - Kyle Machlaclan's naive Jeffery Beaumont stumbles upon a severed ear in the grass one day and discovers a web of crime, perversion, and, yeah, Isabella Rosselini eerily crooning the title song. What makes Blue Velvet so important is the way that Lynch creates an environment of emotions, nightmares, and desires as opposed to a plot-driven machine. Years down the road, it's still difficult to remember whodunit in Lynch's film, but Frank Booth's gas-hissing hysterics, those bugs beneath the grass, and that perfectly white picket fence linger on like a nightmare that enters the real world. Dennis Hopper's masochistic Frank Booth is perhaps the most memorable character from the film, but it's Machlachlan's Jeffery that really makes us shudder. His willing descent from his Leave It To Beaver-esque world into Velvet's realm of violent sexuality reminds us all that we're just a step away from madness.

Looking back there is no question he did this for the money and he has left a trail of many angry employees in his wake.  I for one can tell you the turnaround was occurring before he showed up to take all the credit.  He never responded to any of my emails while I was an employee and hasn't responded to any since my retirement.  HR did respond to the emails that I submitted and their response was that &quot;it was OK that I had sent the email to Lou&quot;.  HR then went on to reiterate the company line.  Lou was not good for IBM or it's employees, he only filled his pockets with our money and left it in shambles..

B00008WJBU|4.0|\\"Intacto\\" is a rather clever film.  This film is also very confusing, which makes it hard to come up with a premise without giving much away.  But here goes.  \\"Intacto\\" is a film essentially luck.  In the film, games are played, think of it as \\"gambling\\", and prizes are won.  However, these are not ordinary prizes.  The prizes are people's luck.  This sounds a little off, but it's true.  The people in the film believe that after playing these games, gathering a picture of someone gives you their luck.  No, I'm not joking.<br />There has been a plane crash, and Tomas is the only survivor.  A man named Federico thinks this is odd, and immediately comes running to see Tomas.  Five years earlier, Federico had his luck taken completely away by The Jew, a holocaust survivor, whom is supossedly the luckiest man alive.  Having lost all of his luck, Federico convinces Tomas to go with him and play \\"games\\", or whatever the heck they call it.<br />I may sound like I'm making fun of the movie, but I'm really not.  This is a very beautiful film, that is beautifully shot, and brilliantly acted.  The film is just so odd.  It's a very original work, and I have to admit, this is a very good film.<br />The only problem is that it's about 45 minutes into the movie before we really think we know what's going on.  In fact, in the beggining the Jew and Federico are talking, but we really don't know what they're talking about, so therefore later when we realize what they were talking about, we forgot all of what they said.  <br />And the games are so bizarre.  My favorite is when they put blindfolds around themselves.  Then, they start at the beggining of a forest of trees.  They then take off through the forrest blindfolded, with many chances of smacking right into a tree.  One by one, the gamblers are knocked flat on their back by trees they run at full speed into.  The last one standing wins.<br />\\"Intacto\\" is definitly bizarre, and at times greatly confusing.  I've only seen the filmonce, and am anxious to see the film again, because this film cannot be solved by being seen once.  The problem with most films of this sort, is that you don't care what really happened.  However, this film makes an exception.
B00008J4P5|5.0|You will not hear another band like this one, but I can tell you now, in the next year or so there will be tons of copy cats. They have a vocal style all their own and it's down to earth and whimsical. It's the kind of music you want playing while you're at the beach kicking back. It's my selection of this Summer season for best cd for recreation.
B000099T2L|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Destiny's Child, so of course I was first in line to get Beyonce's solo CD.  And while it is definitely not like a DC album, it's still the best solo female CD to come out since Alicia Keys' Songs in A Minor.  My favorite songs are Crazy in Love, Hip Hop Star, Be With You and That's How You Like It.  The songs that I'm not really crazy about (yet) are Daddy, Yes, and Signs, which is kind of a pointless song because it's just about the astrological signs.  Anyway, this is a good CD, definitely worth the money.  It'll hold you over until the next DC album.
B00004XMSN|4.0|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is a feel good Christmas story in the \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" tradition. The plot turns around a stressed out, overwrought, harried pastor (David Niven), constantly obsessed about raising funds for a new cathedral. He plays the pinch nosed role to the hilt and turns in the film's best performance. Thickening the plot is his patient, beautiful, too good to be true, supportive wife (Loretta Young), who he usually ignores. An angel ! (Cary Grant) appears to help him out of his misery. Grant is slightly too smooth for words but as good angels will, engineers a happy ending. Young's tolerant, loving attitude toward the brooding Niven is another high point of BW. I was unaware of how attractive she was. The supporting cast, including Gladys Cooper, Elsa Lanchester and Monty Woolley are excellent. The gloomy black and white, wintertime eponymous setting is perfect. This is one movie that should not be colorized! Some have suggested that Young's work in BW was a factor is her winning Best Actress Oscar for \\"The Farmer's Daughter\\" later in 1947. I have read elsewhere that it was Grant who suggested role reversals between he and Niven. The producers certainly were correct to agree! Niven was made to be that unhappy parson! The only weak point is that \\"famous\\" skating scene. What were they thinking? Since when do male angels take some guy's wife skating? That belonged on a cutting room floor! Viewers should find BW excellent Christmas time viewing, unhampered by the overexposure of the other \\"usual suspects\\" shown at that time of year.
0345350499|4.0|Although of course it predates it, Bradley's &quot;Mists&quot; reminds me of an Arthurain version of &quot;The Red Tent&quot;.  The story flows effortlessly, drawing the reader in from beginning to end. It is truly a &quot;storytellers&quot; book, with rich details, characters who evolve, and some unexpected twists and turns. One aspect which particularly surprised me is how Bradley created a medieval feeling without getting overly bogged down in medieval language, wording, etc. Mostly, I found the writing to be fantastic. At times, for example,  I was astonished by how subtly Bradley created a male character to mirror each female character. When we see how Gwen rails against her lack of freedom, we get the same counterpoint in Arthur.   However, I found the dichotomies in the book occasionally obvious, and the last 1/6th of the book seemed to drag, probably because I knew what was going to happen.  <br />I recommend this book highly!!
B00005JLKB|5.0|I am so happy they are finnally putting this out.Oh and to the UK.I love you guys but nah nah nah nah nah nah.We got it and you don't.Its about time.You got Buffy Angel and Friends first but not this baby.Hehe.My wife likes the show but watches her teen idol stuff instead.Now she can watch it anytime.UK,I love ya babe but I have to rub it in a little.I just wish the episode Vortex was in the first season but oh well just have to wait for the next season for that.I love that two parter.Tempest and Vortex...............The Storm.
B00003CXDU|4.0|Especially for Trekkers. Really hits home on how one actor who played an alien is so typecast and even hits onto the fans themselves, like 'shippers. Lol! Kind of does make you wonder just how the actors would have held up if they'd actually had to do what their characters were supposed to do.
B00000JGEH|5.0|It's hard to believe that The Terminator was Arnold Schwarzenegger's Big Break (movies like Conan the Barbarian don't count).  After all, he does very little besides buying heavy artillery and trying to destroy everything in his way.  And he only has a handful of lines -- but one of those lines is his now-famous line, \\"I'll be back\\" (which is actually a surprisingly less-than-meaningful line).<br />Still, the movie was a hit -- and some may even say it's a classic -- and it established Arnold as a serious force to be reckoned with.<br />Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg (a robot that appears to be human) that is sent from the year 2029 back to 1984 on an important mission.  He must kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son, John Connor, is destined to become a leader in the humans' battle against the machines that control their world.  To protect his mother -- and his own existence -- Connor sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to destroy the Terminator.<br />The Terminator is plain and simple action -- right from the beginning.  And I'll be honest -- I enjoyed it.  It's fast-paced and exciting -- and the story's not bad, either.  The Terminator is a movie from The Good Old Days of action films -- when they didn't try to pretend to be something else -- and it's worth seeing.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love this show! I hope season 2 comes out on DVD as well. I've already pre-ordered season 1 and I plan to do the same for season 2.<BR>I hope this show lasts for a while (though we all know it might not, seeing how season 2 ended) Anyway, this show is for the most part clean and good family entertainment.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD.  I've got Wembley on VHS, and this DVD blows that out of the water. <br />The DVD features hours of extra features. A good chunk of the previous night's show is available, plus some previously unseen rehearsal footage. You can also watch part of the show with the camera only on one member of the band (Freddie Cam, Roger Cam, Brian Cam and John Cam). There are also some recent interviews with Roger Taylor and Brian May. Fascinating stuff. <br />So, this DVD isn't just a repackaging of an old product. I loved it and I highly recommend it.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|If you dont like this moive you dont like car's!<br />The best moive ever!<br />The next one if off the chart good to.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I'm playing in front of 500 people this weekend and I can't get a copy of this on vinyl.  How foolish is the label that this band is on. I would be playing this record inside out if I could get it. Whoever runs marketing at this label should be fired pronto. This record could be as big as Missy E's last joint, but nobody is gonna hear this cause nobody on the street can play it. I went to all the biggest hip-hop stores in brooklyn and manhattan and the people in charge just shrug their shoulders.  Can't get it.  This album is all party tracks that are never gonna make it to the party.  I feel sorry for this band. This album deserves to be heard all summer long.
0345350499|5.0|This was, by far, the most amazing book I have ever read. Not speaking facetiously, it changed my life! Ms. Bradley has such a unique and in-depth writing style. Each of the many characters retains their own personalites which are highly distinct, as opposed to many other fantasy books in which the characters are indefinable. <br />The Mists of Avalon gave me a new perspective on the Arthurian legends, as well as the rich history which is intrinsically woven into it. It was so realistic and well researched, placing the whole story into the place in history in which it would have happened. <br />Ms. Bradley also shows how though times have changed, the same basic conflicts remain; conflict of religion, of sexuality, of the role of women vs. men, and of the conflicts one experiences within themselves. <br />Though it took me a long time to read, which was a joy in itself, this book has invariably become my Bible!
0140177396|5.0|&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.<br />Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.<br />Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.<br />An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended.
B000059H99|5.0|Once in a great while a movie comes along that appeals not only to arthouse buffs, but action movie seekers as well. But perhaps none has done as well as Rocky.I strongly recommend you get this movie because it is what I consider essential viewing.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I believe this is one beutiful album, and i will recommend it to anyone. It is just a great CD, with lyrics that mean so much.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool isn't heavy metal or progressive rock.  Tool (and A Perfect Circle, I might add) is &quot;intelli-rock&quot;, that is, intelligent rock, i.e. music that makes you think beyond what is being said in the words.  Listen close to any Tool or APC song, and if you read between the lines a little, you'll discover hidden meanings, as well as the things that aren't being said.
B00008DDXC|4.0|The serpant really got me fired up and I enjoyed watching Harry strike Malfoy at the dueling match. I also think parsel tongue is cool, after watching the movie I kept on reapeting aia hasiheth (parsel tongue) for a week. I give this film 4 stars.
B00005JLEU|5.0|SPIRITED AWAY is a movie you can watch again and again -- because it's art work is first-rate, the story is refreshingly original, and the characters are engaging. The story takes place in modern-day Japan, when a ten-year-old girl explores a strange place with her parents and finds herself &quot;spirited away&quot;. The spirits in this story are an exotic mix of frogs, humanoids, and river spirits. When her parents are transformed into pigs, our young heroine must rely on inner strength, hard work, and newfound friends to make the best of a very challenging situation.<br />Parents and children alike will be enchanted by this film -- it's awesome!
B000067IW0|5.0|I discovered this film (probably as many twenty-somethings do) in college. I had to take a class on international cinema and I watched excerpts of this in a documentary about German Expressionism and the Weimar cinema. I was so entranced by the snippets I saw that I knew I simply had to view and own the whole thing. Thankfully, this inexpensive DVD is available. True, the film quality may leave something to be desired, but, as a student, I simply don't have much money to spend at the moment and I felt this version was a lifesaver. The film's cinematography is stunning; I can think of few others that place the audience so well in a confusing, murky, dreamlike environment. The costumes and makeup are outstanding as well. The lack of overblown special effects actually adds much to the film-- Cesare's stark makeup makes him five times more frightening than today's movie monsters. The high contrast between light and dark (in the setting and the costuming) only heightens the fear factor. In terms of plot, _Dr. Caligari_ keeps the audience engaged. The conclusion is open to interpretation. I have my own favorite theory of course, but I'll refrain from sharing it so that I don't spoil the film for any first time viewers. The film's influence is evident though I, like others, am surprised that no direct remake has been produced. One reviewer noted that Anthony Hopkins would make a good Dr. Caligari. I agree wholeheartedly and I posit that Willem Dafoe would make a fantastic Cesare.
0316666343|1.0|Like many others I was led to believe that this was an outstanding example of serious literature. What it was, after reading seventy pages, I discovered,  was silly hokum and a brazen attempt at bathos to move everyone to tears. It's like a fairy tale that turns into a nightmare of boredom. It will be amusing to see the author's next ployto make a lot of money while having really nothing to say. Save your time. Read DINO instead.
B00008I8IF|5.0|I'm a 38 year old world-weary journalist who rarely gushes about new releases anymore but...<BR>This CD is fantastic. I've been a Jayhawks fan for about ten years and I can say I favor Rainy Day Music to Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass. It's one of those rare cd's you can put in the player and forget it. <BR>And this is after ten or fifteen listens, it's not just because Rainy Day Music still has that new car smell. It's terrific.<BR>I can't wait to see them live in Orlando(hint hint)playing this career record live.<BR>Bravo boys and believe me, I'm telling anyone who'll listen-GET IT.
B00003CXXI|4.0|This movie is hilarious! I mean donkey is the voice of Eddie Murphy and u know how funny he is. <BR> Shrek(Mike Myers) was funny too although he can get serius sometimes.<BR>Shrek and Donkey are trying to rescue princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz) from a dragon so they can return the princess to Lord Farquaad(John Lithgow) who took over Shrek's land with Fairy tale creatures. They are on this quest to get Shrek's home back.<BR> The story line may seem childish but you will grow to like it as the movie goes by with funny moments. <BR> The only thing about this movie is some of the humor is too grown for kids. I am warning you about that. If you see the movie for the first couple of times you will like it but then the movie gets old. But this is still a good movie to watch! See it!!!
B0000639FE|1.0|Complete garbage. Clich directing, acting, romance, predictability, happy ending, bad character changing into a good one, everone overcomes greed to become a real happy family, a sad conflict where the family doesn't quite work out is quickly erased by the small resolution to the tiny conflict, and the worst part is the kid who is simply in the movie to draw &quot;aww isn't that cute&quot;'s from the audience. Just like every movie you've ever seen, and that is the main reason why I can't stand movies these days. Perfect chick flick for those mindless zombies who have no need to expand or stimulate their mind because they use it so infrequently anyways.
6302158095|5.0|I totally love this Disney classic. Disney did a great job on this one. It had different scenes about animals, music, and people. Each of these scenes have great performances with dancing, colors, music, designs, and a lot of magical action. I would recommend this movie to anybody. It is a very well done movie. My favorite scene is with Mickey Mouse the wizard.
B00005JJX8|5.0|\\"To catch a thief\\" has many elements that will grip all kinds of viewers to the screen. The scenario is the great french Riviera, and you have to add to the incredible landscape the fact that this movie was made in 1954, so there's that glamorous, \\"antique\\" touch. Main characters: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Cary Grant is what women call \\"good-looking\\" and besides he has a tremendous comic vein that shows in his face. His kind of comedy is subtle and many times he doesn't have to say a word, just using his facial expressions to be funny (watch also Hitchcock's \\"North by northwest\\" to see how funny Cary Grant can be). Grace Kelly has the highest beauty and glamour possible in an actress in the fifties (similar to Nicole Kidman in the 2000s). Also, she's a very talented and expressfull actress, being alternately cute and hard. And, hanging above it all we have Alfred Hitchcock, more than just directing, conductiong his orchestra.<br />With all these elements, \\"To catch a thief\\" has to be an interesting and entertaining movie. The plot: Cary Grant is John \\"the cat\\" Robie, a retired jewel thief living comfortably in the Riviera. But, to his dismay, recently some copycat (get it?) starts robbing the wealthy people on vacation in southern France. Not only the police suspects Cary Grant went back on business, but also his former comrades in crime threaten him, not wanting to return to prison.<br />During 100 minutes, Hitchcock and his cast give us thrilling chasing scenes along narrow, drop-dead roads, the usual falling corpses and vertigo situation, romantic conflicts and, in the end, a twist that, if not completely unexpexted, still good. In fact, all these features are somewhat shadowed by the amazingly fast-paced and intelligent dialogue between the main characters. \\"To catch a thief\\" may not be Hitchcock's finest and most thrilling movie, but it's a good example that he could make non-Hitchcock-regular movies and still be very good.<br />Grade 8.7/10
0788812807|5.0|This is a Disney movie that me and my sister love to watch. It shows a love connection between a rich house cocker spaniel name Lady and a street mut named Tramp. The speggetti scene with the two love dogs was awesome and the music. I also like the scene with Lady vs. the two siamese cats. That was awesome too. This is a great movie to watch especially if you are a dog lover. You wil see all kinds of dogs in this movie and keeps getting interesting evry minute. Just see it! I said enough!
B0000931QA|5.0|One of the best heavy rock albums ever!
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce Knowles is back for the first time...well kind of. \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is her attempt to shed the Destiny's Child persona and restablish herself as a solo songstress. Hot joints include the retro \\"Crazy In Love\\" her first single off the album...the seductive \\"Naughty Girl\\"...\\"Baby Boy\\" featuring Sean Paul is sure to be a club banger...\\"Be With You\\" which could easily be the edited version to Adina Howard's \\"Freak Like Me\\"...\\"Signs\\" is a good slow song but too predictable. \\"That's How I Like It\\" featuring Jay-Z is definitely the best song off the album in my opinion. What really confused me was \\"Dangerously In Love 2.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the same version from Destiny's Child \\"Survivor\\" album or what? All in all, \\"Dangerously In Love\\" doesn't verge too far from the Destiny's Child formula, which might make some wonder why Beyonce went solo in the first place.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I can honestly say that TMV isint like anything youve ever heard...But really.. this has to be the best freakin cd in the world...i was a big fan of ATDI but this totaly rocks them...Cedric and omar are the best musicians ever

B000099T2L|4.0|Well, with the recent success of bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, people were starting to doubt Beyoncé would be able to match the originiality and the suprisingly amount of success that her bandmates have had. Excited about listening to the debut album from the world's leading female performer at the moment, I have to say i was dissapointed with the first listen. I felt that a lot of the songs had the same rythm and beat. There were some good songs that stood out: 'Crazy in love', 'Naughty girl', 'Hip Hop Star', The closer i get to you', and 'work it out'. these all were my favourites at the start. but after listening to it more and more, i feel that it is an excellent album. with the exception of some tunes: 'Signs'; which is a song about starsigns, with an annoying chorus, and says it features missy elliot when all she says in the song is 'rewind!'!, 'gift from virgo'; about starsigns again, plus a big big headed considering she is talking about how she is a gift! the album is good. from former reviews i was expecting the duet with Luther Vandros to be outstanding, and it is very good, but not spine chilling, she doesnt show her full vocal skills. and that is the feel for most of the album. she is trying to be 'street',a dn too hip-hop ehich is ok for a few songs, but i would like to hear more spine chilling tunes that really show off her voice.<br />5 BEST TUNES: Crazy in love, B with you, The closer i get to you, Naughty girl, Work it out.<br />5 WORST TUNES: Signs, Speechless, Yes, Baby boy, Beyoncés interlude(too cheesy!)<br />Overall rate outta 10: 7
0446691437|5.0|I've recommended this book to every writer I know, plus bought copies for my closest friends.  Be prepared to look yourself squarely in the eyes and kiss your excuses goodbye.  It's a book you'll read more than once...and be better for it.
B000099T2L|5.0|She is a true talent,The next Tina Turner,Diana Ross,etc. She takes it to the next level, I'm so impressed. She has songs on here for teenagers to mature adults. She has risen the bar, everyone needs to follow....
B00005U11Z|1.0|Sorry, but this band should be called Journey 2 or some other name.  The real Journey IS Steve Perry.  I've tried to listen and watch the new lead singer do these songs, but it just isn't right.  Would you go see a Led Zeppelin concert today if the lead singer was some new guy?  Sorry, but the lead singer is too important of a person to replace and then go forward like nothing has happened.  I bought this trying to accept the change...but I won't be spending any more bucks on the &quot;new&quot; Journey!
B000001EAQ|4.0|U2 has set standards so high, that less than perfection  seems a disapointment.  At 7 million copies sold, POP is a disapointment most bands would kill over.<br />In reality, POP contains songs that are among the bands best.<br />MOFO is among the best dance songs of all time.  You could groove too it if you wanted.  But in the midst of all that noise, are some of the best lyrics Bono has ever written.<br />PLEASE is a sort of sequel to SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY, and musically at least, probably even better.  It is the band firing on all cylinders, with Adam Clayton delivering one of his best bass lines.<br />THE PLAYBOY MANSION is Edge at his most soulful.  IF YOU WEAR THAT VELVET DRESS started out as a B-Side, but was too good to leave off the album and is among its highlights.  <br />You can hear Bono having a ball recording MIAMI.  Even Alan Ginsberg was a fan. He quoted the lyrics in admiration of Bono's take on Beat Poetry.<br />I'm not completely sure why this album was considered disapointing to some.  I think in part, the marketing when it was first released was quite poor.  Save maybe three songs, it is not a dance album.<br />It is, arguably our most consistently great band, taking risks and winning out.  Maybe it will become their MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. U2 takes more risks than most bands near their stature would dare dream. Give this disc a few good listens...You'll LEARN TO LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS...
B00009V7T2|4.0|In a music world where so few artists seem willing to stray beyond their little boxes of commercial convenience (unless it is to skip to someone else's little box), it's a rare thing to come across musicians who push the boundaries of both themselves and their audience.  Radiohead are the top of the heap in this category, but the debut CD from The Mars Volta (made up of half the remnants of hard-core art rockers At the Drive-In) rockets this group to the forefront of major-label musical adventurers.<BR> De-Loused in the Comatorium is a 60-minute conceptual odyssey that tells a cryptic tale about a character named Cerpin Taxt (based on a real person known to the band) that may be lacking in narrative coherency but triumphs as an exotic and bold exercise in aural drama.<BR>The band blends elements of rock, jazz, electronica, prog and more into a heady stew that hits the listener with a real sense of atmosphere and power.  Like the new Radiohead, this CD requires active and repeated listening to glean all its diverse qualities.<BR>Those who like their music programmed and spoon-fed need not apply here, but those who believe that great music requires the participation of the listener will find their efforts here richly rewarded.<BR>A quick note about me.  This is my first music review for this site, so for purposes of comparison, I offer this short list of what I consider 5-star CDs to give you some reference point regarding the rating of this title:  Radiohead - Everything after Pablo Honey; Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here; King Crimson - Larks Tongues in Aspic; Rush - Moving Pictures; Richard and Linda Thompson - Shoot Out the Lights; Nick Drake - All three studio albums; Yes - The Yes Album; Genesis - Selling England By the Pound; Led Zeppelin - Physical Graffiti; Brian Eno - Another Green World; Granddaddy - The Sophtware Slump.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Bloody, visually mesmerizing but emotionally uninvolving. Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher is frighteningly intense and Leonardo De Caprio as a revenge seeking son of Bill's slain enemy is woefully miscast. Great extras include a tour of the amazing mammoth sets that replicate Five Points New York, circa 1850. And there's a terrific first-ever commentary from Scorsese.  But where's the four hour director's cut?
B00005JL3A|5.0|When I was younger (much younger) there was a movie venue in America called the \\"drive in.\\"  Folks pulled up in cars, attached speakers to their windows, and watched movies on a large wall set in an enormous field. In my day, the drive in had two uses. One: it was a place where you took a girl on a date because you were too young  to have your own apartment and not worldly enough to get a hotel room. When used like this, you and your date simply steamed up the windows in your old man's car, and it didn't matter what the movie was. The other purpose of the drive in was to go with a gang of your friends (with one usually stuffed in the trunk to save the price of one ticket) bringing in as much beer and wine-cooler as you could stuff under the seats. Resident Evil would have made a perfect drive-in movie, and frankly, I loved it.<br />The gore was well done, barrowing from Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Night of the Living Dead. Milla Jovovich is a pleasure to look at, scampering through the whole affair in a miniskirt, and she displayed a real flair for action as well. Finally, there is just enough good story and plotting to keep you brain at least idling.<br />Nope, it's not Citizen Kane, but then sometimes that's a good thing. It was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who always brings a certain integrity to all his work, and at the least this is a carefully crafted movie.<br />Back in the day, my friends and I would have talked for hours about this film, and considered it time well spent.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Like almost every sequel ever produced...this movie has lost the magic (forgive the pun) that the first carried so elequently. hough it is still remarkable, and is based on a book that in some ways out did its predecessor, this movie did not seem to outdo its cinematic prequel. However, it is still an excellent movie. Nothing better serves you then when one of your favorite novels makes its way on to the big screen. Definitely worth buying.
B00003003R|3.0|This album is a great mix of GNR's most popular songs. It is an awesome wrap up of GNR's music and is a good summary of the best years of GNR. However, there are a few problems. One, the sound of the cheering can get extremely annoying and sometimes drowns out the sound of some of the songs. There are a few differences in the tune of some of the songs and the intensity of Axl's singing. One in particular, &quot;November Rain&quot;. This album is good for an overall summary of GNRs best songs, but if you don't like the cheering and the live sound of songs, another cd may be a better option for you.  If you don't think this is for you, you may like Appetite for Destruction better. It has a lot of the same songs, but with a more clean sound and it still has great songs. I do recommend this album, however if you don't like the live sound, keep looking, because it's not for you.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Like the title says..this show was basically the villain of the week variety. However, the overall theme that made this a little different was Luthor. Lex Luthor, possibly the most infamous ic villain of all time. And when fans saw the devoloping friendship between Luthor and Clark, it sowed the seeds for what promises to be one of the bloodiest fallouts of all time. <br />Other than that, Smallville was as afore mentioned, a villain of the week show. People with kryptonite electricity powers, kryptonite psychics, ect. But mid-season, the show began to drift from its stereotype. Overnight, or over seven nights between each episode, it seemed to become more of a show about growth. It began to focus on the characters, and it finally became a hit. Then it killed the audiences. The season finale was in fact a cliff hanger...one that ... many off. So, buy this DVD knowing that it will leave you hanging...and wanting more. If you think this season was great...and it was...then season II will blow you away.
0393317552|5.0|Ever wonder why European cultures became the dominant conquering forces in the world?<br />Certainly there are many reasons, but Jared Diamond has written a brilliant synthesis of the development of mankind and cultures that has led up to the world as we know it.  He outlines the fascinating impact that geography, agriculture (the germs), and technology (the guns and steel) have on human cultures.  It seems that many times we are a product of our environment.

This book is a must reading for everyone!!
B000099T2L|5.0|It's not often that a cd release is deemed as critical as Beyonce's \\"Dangerously in Love.\\"  It seems that Beyonce was completely aware that fans, and foes alike will view this as a crucial milestone in her career.  I have been a fan of Beyonce since \\"No, No, No.\\"  I hung in there with all the DC drama, and now we finally have what could be one of the most refreshing surprises of the year in the world of music.<br />There are plenty of reviews here that state that this cd is far from what you would expect, especially if you are a hardcore Destiny's Child fan..  I agree as well. Actually, I was expecting an album full of jamming beats and lyrics that were put together just to make one line rhyme with another.  I'm so glad that I was dead wrong.  Beyonce has something to say about who she is AS AN ARTIST.  And she does it so well.  <br />Collectively, the most notable aspect of the cd that sticks out to me is that Beyonce's vocals are more relaxed.  She's not forcing riffs like she has done on previous DC albums.  I have two theories on this:  One:  she is relaxed because she know that this is a solo project so there is no need to stand out as the leader of a group.  Two:  she is full aware that everyone knows that she is the leader of DC and she can finally relax.  <br />It's not a clear distinction if Beyonce wants to convey where she's been or where she's going or where she would like to go.  That's the joy of this record.  It's like she could sing some of these lyrics and follow it with a giddy \\"I was just playing.\\"  She let us know that she was more than just singing cool hooks to funky beats when she amazed us with \\"Work it Out.\\"  My favorite jam on the album is \\"Naughty Girl.\\"  It brings back nostalgic feelings of Vanity 6's \\"Nasty Girl.\\"  It should definitely be the next single.  My favorite ballad is more difficult because I'm torn between \\"Me, Myself, and I,\\" \\"Yes,\\" and \\"Signs.\\"<br />What puzzles me even more is will this fusion of funk, r& b , even rock androll spill over onto the next DC record?  It would suit me just fine, but I don't think a lot of fickle fans out there would be able to handle it.<br />A+
B00008H2LB|4.0|It is unlikely that you won't like this new album by Linkin Park if you liked &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. The blend of rap and nu-metal is there. The winning formula is intact. A great follow-up to a good debut album. Get it!
0062515675|5.0|Sharma does an excellent job at putting in one book most of what so many have said before. <BR>I found almost everything in this book in some other books from several masters of self help, but I never found so many advices in just one place and writen in a way that motivates the reader to follow them.<BR>I will keep this book near me at all times.
6305922756|5.0|Rob Reiner's &quot;This is Spinal Tap,&quot; the funniest film ever made, was the first official mockumentary from writer-star Christopher Guest, who later released &quot;Best in Show,&quot; &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; and the absolutely brilliant &quot;Waiting for Guffman.&quot;<br />Centered around the disastrous American tour of aging, bad rock &quot;legends&quot; Spinal Tap, the film manages both broad, naughty humor and occasional wink-wink parody of rock concert films that were released in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br />And though this review is making &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; sound rather studied and boring, it's anything but. It's clever, silly and highly quotable, the kind of movie you and your friends will quote back and forth to one another years after watching it.<br />And the performance of &quot;Stonehenge&quot; is, hands down, the funniest moment I've ever seen in a film. Every time I watch that scene, and I've seen the film about 75 times since my first viewing in 1998, I fall on the floor, giggling so hard that I can barely breathe.<br />This is an absolutely fantastic film. I won't go all cliche and borrow its most famous quote, saying that the film &quot;goes to 11,&quot; but it does. Oh wait, I just did ...<br />Great movie. Great soundtrack. A must-own.
6305252572|4.0|Eddie Murphy followed others from SNL as me emerged from Mr Rogers sketches and began his movie career.  It was 1982 and people wanted to laugh as the US economy was struggling back from its worst period since the great depression.  Eddie Murphy teamed with Nick Nolte, who got his fame as the bad boy brother from \\"Rich Man Poor man\\" and EM and NN were tremendous together.  This movie created a lot of \\"buzz\\" where I worked and of course we got a 48 Hours II.  Nick was the big star payroll wise, but in his first movie, EM shows the promise, which I believe he has fulfilled in becoming one of our greatest movie actors.  For sheer talent is there anyone better than Eddie Murphy?  <br />I give this only 4 stars because of the language and violence which makes it not family friendly.  So put the little ones to bed, sit back and enjoy.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie was simply amazing.  I'll admit that at first I thought it would not be enjoyable, but very quickly I became hooked.  After watching this movie you can't help but love it, and you can't help but fall in love with the loveable and loyal yakul as I have.  YAKUUUUUUUUUUUULL!!
B000099T2L|4.0|This album did exceed my expectations.I was at first dissapointed at all the remakes and the Luther Vandross duet was out of place.But the part that I really disliked was the hidden track at the end stating &quot; I want my husband to be like my daddy.&quot; That was the corniest thing I had ever heard. Other than that the album was well worth the wait. The song with Sean Paul is flawless and also the Hip Hop Star song. I think <BR>Beyonce' is so very talented and even though her CD isn't the best I've heard, Ashanti will have to work hard to top it! Congratulations Bee!
B0000004V2|5.0|the album starts as if your floating in the clouds with the song<BR>i wanna be adored.and  the song she bangs the drum give a feeling you just can't describe..this is the best album ever made even there darkest songs makes u wanna dance.fools gold is a funcky cool song with a half sung vocals by ian brown.these 4 guys got something really special here.this album will be in your memory forever.if u wanna taste paradise on earth this is the album to have..
B00006LLLN|5.0|Are you often disappointed with LIVE cds? The sound is normally horrible, but more than that, your favorite band often sounds like hooie! It's such a disappointment to learn that your favorite band relies on studio technology to sound good!<br />This live set is SO unique! The sound is awesome and Alison sounds better than ever. What an incredible treat to the listener. She and her band deserve all the fame they get.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies and they're gonna re-release it! \\"National Lampoon's Animal House - Double Secret Probation Widescreen Edition\\".  Cool...
B00005JLR1|5.0|I remember when this film was first released in movie theatres. The graphics looked really cool on the teaser, but the title was so weak that it wasn't enough to get me into the theatre. Well, I sure wish I would have seen it on the big screen! &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; is a feast for the eyes! The space shots, the ship, the whole interplanetary idea is really marvelous! And the story is incredibly moving, based on Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island.&quot; The young hero, Jim, comes from a broken home, and wants to find his place in the world. Of course, like any young man, he's rebellious and has such great spirit, but he doesn't have a fatherly hand to guide him. When a space pirate crashes on his Mom's Inn and entrusts young Jim with a treasure map, the adventure begins! Jim and his tutor (a lovable, dog-faced creature voiced by David Hyde Pearce) book passage on the RLS, a gorgeous space-boat under the command of a feisty female captain (wonderfully voiced by Emma Thompson). Unbeknownest to Jim and the captain, the ship is actually being run by a mutinous gang of pirates lead by Long John Silver, a cyborg (part man, part machine). John Silver is masquerading as the cook, and he begrudgingly takes young Jim under his wing. A real friendship develops between these two, which is problematic for Silver's plans for taking over the ship and claiming the treasure on Treasure Planet for himself. Needless to say, this movie is based on a great story, and the furturistic retelling is truly splendid. I found myself moved from laughter to tears to complete awe at the splendor of the film. It's a definate must-have for anyone who loves animated features!
B000002U82|5.0|Este disco me llego a mi por intermedio de un amigo en los 70's, recuerdo que lo compre en versin americana (en el Per no se permita la importacin en esos tiempos), el vynil americano vena con un poster de las piramides y las letras, a penas lo puse en mi tornamesa me quede impresionado con esta musica, despues adquiri el CD y se que por el 30 aniversario ha salido una  edicion en SACD que espero comprarmela, este disco es una excelente manera de comenzar a escuchar este genero llamado &quot;Rock Progresivo&quot; no le quito merito a los dems discos de Floyd son algunos muy buenos pero &quot;Dark Side of The Moon&quot; por lo menos en los 70's fue el mejor, si quieren empezar escuchando buena musica como aficionados este es el disco, si quieres coleccionar musica de los 70's tienes que contar con  Dark Side Of The Moon disco de coleccin suerte.
B000083E79|4.0|I am not a Cher fan by nature, but have enjoyed certain songs she has done.  I was delighted to find this cd with all the songs of her's that I enjoy.  It is well put together and sung by a very talented lady despite the media's claims.  She didn't let them get the best of her and she persevered.  This cd can be enjoyed by all musical tastes. Thanks Cher!
0688163173|4.0|I find that I am still questioning the ending of the story and trying to decide what really happened. Because of that, I think it was a great read. If a book has me still thinking about it a week later or even more and considering going back and re-reading it then it was a sucess. I will be looking for other books by this author to read.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There has been much speculation over where exactly the title of the new Radiohead album, Hail to the Thief, came from. Rolling Stone attributes it to a line from George Orwell's 1984, Spin claims it's a popular anti-George W. Bush phrase, while the band's lead singer, Thom Yorke, insists that he heard the phrase during a radio program analyzing the election of 1888.<br />Wherever the phrase comes from, Radiohead's music still reigns supreme. The opener, \\"2+2=5\\", is quite possibly the best song to come out of Radiohead since \\"Paranoid Android\\" off their unmatched opus, OK Computer. But, Hail to the Thief is great in its own right. Never letting go of its constant sense of paranoia, the album occasionally will deliver a soft, piano-laden tune like \\"Sail to the Moon\\" and \\"I Will\\", but not before it scares you half to death with \\"The Gloaming\\" and \\"Backdrifts\\", both containing the totally messed-up tape loops that made 2001's Amnesiac so challenging.<br />Another item that sets this disc apart from its predecessors is that Radiohead actually attempt traditional songwriting and melodic breaks that don't fall into waves of electronic explosions. Yes, there is a lot of the electronics on Hail to the Thief, but it's the organic sounds that make this one memorable. In the middle of the disturbingly slow-trodden \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", Thom and Co. all of a sudden jump into a jazzy piano interlude before falling right back into the original melody. They take a similar vein with \\"A Wolf at the Door\\", one of the best tracks on the album. Primarily written by Jonny Greenwood, the band's resident guitar, analogue systems, ondes martenot, laptop, toy piano and glockenspiel player, the tune sounds almost playful and symphonic. It would've made a nice track to put on The Bends if it weren't for Thom's lyrics about a wolf kidnapping his children, making the track more sinister. The verses are also about as close to rap as Radiohead is ever going to get.<br />Also worth mentioning is the fact that an unmixed version of Hail to the Thief was leaked onto the Internet months before the final release. Members of Radiohead as well as producer Nigel Godrich were quite angry even though the title of the album seemed to encourage this kind of behavior. So, hail to the thief, indeed; just don't get caught.he fact that an unmixed version of Hail to the Thief was leaked onto the Internet months before the final release.

B000002MIY|5.0|If you do not have The Nightfly I recommend that too. This is a great CD.  It is noticeable when Beckers presence is there in this CD. The two are magical together! This is another loved CD in my collection. This proves Fagen can DO IT AGAIN! I love these guys!!!!
B00000K3CK|5.0|This is a classic film with a great cast, the likes of<br />which we will never see again. This version is far better<br />in every way than any of the cheesy, poorly cast remakes.<br />If you want to see a great film like this one, stick to<br />the original and skip the poorly done, politically correct<br />remakes.
B000092ZYX|1.0|This is truly awful stuff.  Horribly cliched social commentary from liberals who don't know a democrat from Ann Coulter.
0393057658|5.0|This is one of the top baseball books I have other read.  Its fun, moves along, and is an interesting look behind the scenes. AS a long time reader of Bill James, it was interesting to see the James work coming back to life in mainstream circles.  It is also a story of people who did not merely accept their fate, but reinvted it into one that they could win...a lesson many of us could learn.  Certainly, all baseball fans should read this book.

0061040967|5.0|Pratchett's unique and ultra-creative characters would typically be too complex and, well, outlandish to appropriately capture in artwork.  Fortunately, Paul Kidby was up to the challenge and he has done a magnificent job in bringing Discworld to life.<BR>The Last Hero, in truth, is the story of Discworld's GREATEST hero, Ghenghiz Cohen the Barbarian.  The fabled adventurer-turned-Emperor is getting old and is not very happy about it.  He blames the gods for his plight, reasoning that his great deeds should grant him immortality.  Joining him are the Silver Horde - his fellow adventurers who, though also in their declining years, have lost little of their battle prowess.  Kidnapping a minstrel (since every great adventure needs to be remembered in song) they head to the mountain home of the gods with a gigantic explosive and aim to detonate it at the top.  <br />The problem is - this will also destroy all magic and, hence, the world.<br />The world's only hope lies with Ankh-Morpork's resident genius-with-ADD, Leonard of Quirm, and his flying machine.<br />This book was an unexpected surprise and a top-notch addition to the Discworld universe.  For those keeping score, this technically belongs in the &quot;Watch&quot; sub series, possibly falling after The Fifth Elephant.  Highest possible recommendation.
B00005JLSE|5.0|like the former review, stating that i have never seen the stage version.  i never even herd of any of the songs on cd. therefore i had no idea what was in store for me. i saw this movie 3 times. i will wait in line to get it dvd. i bought the special edition of the cd.  it also includes a special dvd that has the video on it as well.  it also has some of the original songs that was heard in the play, back in the '70s. this will be a must for my dvd collection. i heard that they are working on Rent, Les Miserolbs (sp), and Mrs Sigon. i am very glad that musicals are now back in the spotlight again.
B000002U8G|3.0|Yea, I know I really probably shouldn't be reviewing this, since all I ever listen to on this cd is Echoes, but...I must say I've given the other songs their fair chance, and none of them stuck with me or interested me, even after repeat listenings. This is why it gets not 5 or 4 stars, but 3. BUT, if I didn't like Echoes is would get a 1. Echoes...how do you describe it? It starts off sounding like a dripping water faucet, then morphs into a poppy kind of tropical sound: \\"Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air\\". (The words are great too.) Then the pop sound falls away into just a beat, and then an eerie sound like...well if fog could have a sound that would be it. I won't tell you the about the rest of it, the sounds in the fog, they're just too chilling to describe! So summary: first 5 songs are bland, #6 is a 23 minute long piece of heaven.  (Oh...and by the way, listen to it with your eyes closed and the lights off.) Enjoy! :-D
0793518326|5.0|This is one of the best books on Beatle music that I have ever seen. In fact, I've been using it for the past several months uninterrupted...and having a blast! While it's not a 100% accurate (I have never found any music transcription book free of error), it clearly is a most highly commendable book and worth every penny! Nothing short of fantastic!  My only quibbles are as follows:<br />1. Claims to have all Beatle songs, but doesn't have Free as a Bird (one of my favs) and Real Love (I don't really miss this one anyways).<br />2. The type they used is too small (something like 8 pt or smaller) and often too difficult to read, especially for old duffers like me. A larger type would have been much nicer, but then it would turn this very heavy book into a massively heavy book.<br />3. Some of the notation was confusing to me, like the shorthand they used for repeating the notes from previous bar into the next bar rather than typing out the notes again. I was able to figure this out, but it would have been nicer to include a more complete musical notation legend at the beginning of the book.<br />But these are minor complaints...I really have nothing but praise for the book. So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to my piano to play Lady Madonna.....
080017948X|5.0|One of the best comedic performances to date by Bill Murray.  He carries the load virtually by himself throughout the movie, although he also has an outstanding supporting cast.  <br />Doomed to relive Groundhog Day over and over again, we follow Murray's emotions as he goes from denial to acceptance, from happy to suicidal, and finally to conformity with his situation.  We follow all of his hilarious attempts to correct the mistakes he makes in wooing his boss which he does by repeating all of his actions up to the point of failure and then correcting each failure the next day.  And he does this until he can actually live out the &quot;perfect day.&quot;<br />Lots of laughs here. Excellent acting by Murray.  If you are a Murray fan, this is a definite &quot;must have&quot; DVD.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Being the huge Fleetwood Mac that I am, I ran out and bought &quot;Say You Will&quot; the very first day it was released. I listened to it while I was driving home in my totally awesome Saab 9-3, really great car, nice color..Anyway, no one else cares but me...and I didn't quite know what to make of the album. I certainly did not dislike it, because it IS FM after all. But it just didn't grab me the way Rumours and Tusk did, or the way Stevie's Bella Donna did. I think Lindey's songs are much better than Stevie's on this project, at least lyrically. Stevie's best songs here, imo, are &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, &quot;Say you Will&quot;, and &quot;Silver Girl&quot;. Lindsey's &quot;Red Rover&quot; is awesome!!, as is his guitar work on Cme&quot;. I hate the new &quot;Smile at you&quot;, and prefer the 70's full on rock demo. The biggest disgrace on this album is &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot;. Stevie's 1976 demo of this song, which is about her abortion, is very moving. The vocal on this song is horrible..she kind of sounds like cyndi lauper in the chorus. Very bad way to close out an 18 song set, but all in all, I recommend &quot;Say You Will&quot;
B00009V7T2|5.0|The numerous transitions and complex arrangements are a throw back to the classic rock psychadelica of big names like The Doors and Pink Floyd and  Led Zeppelin to more modern avante-garde rockers like Sonic Youth and Tool. The miles of lyrics and vocals are a homage to opera, and the lyrics themselves are complex meshes of pretentious logic and free assosciation poetry. The abrasive heavyness gives it a fresh amazing twist that makes you wanna go deranged to cosmic insanity, and the Santana latin groove-influenced interludes and no-wavish noise/electronic sounds that meander in between the riffage makes it a thrilling experience...<br /> ...Like other modern alternative/experimental rock artists today who have mangaed to turn the complex ethics of classic rock and early metal into  more forward thinking evolutionary collages and concept albums---Sonic Youth, Mr. Bungle, Tool, Blonde Redhead, Radiohead, John Zorn, Beck, Olivia Tremor Control, the list goes on---they have manged to make an awesome album that is a world all to its own and a must-have for anyone who is a fan of the above-mentioned artists or just brand spanking new music that pushes the boundaries in general. Get this, you will not be disappointed. It rocks hard, but it also can groove to spacey jam sessions and zones you out to higher levels of conciousness with atmospheric ambience...and it usually does this several times per song, which explains the usual 5+ lengths. It is everything, and Mars Volta are definitely going places...<br />P.S.: For At THe Drive In purists, this will push past fans into even more exciting types of music and hopefully encourage further exploration into the avante-garde scene as well. Sparta doesn't compare to the greatness of this album, but they are still very good and Wiretap Scars should definitely be picked up. Get this album....for the future of rock and roll, mang.
B000000OTU|4.0|Here are Aerosmith's best from their Geffen Records era. They signed with the label in 1985 after reforming(they disbanded in 1980). The original tracks are &quot;Walk On Water&quot; and &quot;Blind Man&quot;,the latter becoming a hit. The other 13 tracks are from PERMANENT VACATION,PUMP,GET A GRIP and THE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD EXPERIENCE. There are no tracks from the band's first Geffen album DONE WITH MIRRORS. Most of the tracks on this album would be recycled for OH YEAH! ULTIMATE AEROSMITH HITS in 2002.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie is about the reltionships of a family in chaos. Poor Lilo and Nani lost their parents and Nani is trying to be a mother to her little sister.<BR>I'm reading folks here complain about how cruel they are to each other...just think people! Those two girls are stil grieving and trying to stay together. And for goodness sakes how many families with siblings do you know that don't have moments in their life when they fight, hurl insults etc....<BR>So many people don't seem to understand the premise of this film is family, not happy, all sugar and smiles family, but real heart on your sleeve surving through tradgedy family.<BR>Lilo is violent and fights with the other kids because of her pain and honestly the kids were picking on her first. <BR>She and Stitch teach each other to get past violence and to become whole again, Lilo in getting past her and Nani's grief and Stitch in his learning how to love.<BR>Get real folks, this film was BRILLIANT! I wish Disney would stop trying to make a quick buck with it cheap and stupid sequals and produce more films like this, that deal with the true heart and feeling of folks.<BR>Plus I'm tired of the CGI vs. hand drawn animation debate, I love both, you can't get the beauty of Sleeping Beauty, Lilo & Stitch with CGI, but you can get the delightful Toy Story films and Monsters, Inc. so lets keep both OK?
B00008I8IF|5.0|This album is simply amazing from start to finish.<BR>Ethan Johns' production is marvelous.<BR>From tracks like &quot;save it for a rainy day&quot; to &quot;come to the river&quot;...it is just too hard to pick your own favorite song. Get this album! You will love it. I don't care who you are.
0198534469|5.0|This is a marvelous presentation of the subject.  After looking at many analysis books which require a great deal of coffee to accompany them, I was surprised to find a book that would keep me awake till 3 a.m. without a caffeine supplement.  The concepts are visually presented and clearly explained.  Needham even shows how Mobius transformation is connected to Einstein's great idea.  This is definitely a great book!
B000099T2L|5.0|Str8 to the point. Beyonce has made one hell of a CD. It flows toghter so well. Its a very \\"fun sexy romatic album.\\" After hearing some trakcs that were leaked to the net such as \\"baby Boy..Mix tape version and  \\"speechless\\" . I was alreay VERY impresed. Its rare that a 21yr old Can co write and co produce such a great body of art. The BEST thing about DIL(Dangeroulsy In Love)Is that is just mixed with such lush mid tempo ballads and your club tracks as well. Very Diverse from old school Isley Brothers Soul. To hard Knockin ATL beats. Its so diverse but at the same time not all over the place. Evreything fits right toghter. Honestly speaking this is one CD you can bang all the way through on the way to the club and then on da way home and then while u makin love, whateva have you. It will take time to appericate the tru beauty of \\"DIL\\". for its one of the best RnB records to drop in past couple years. Ex Ashanti, That is no TALENT! if you wana be blown away by an amazing vocie , beautiful lyrics, and truley AWSOME beats...get DIL ASAP..She is predicted to blow away the billboard chatrs...and take my word...
B00000DCHE|4.0|This album was recorded on various days and at various locations between June and July 1980. Billy was promoting his GLASS HOUSES album. He and his band decided to tape a few concerts from the tour and release some live performances of his pre-STRANGER material. We start with a TURNSTILES track,MIAMI 2017(Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway),recorded at New York City's famous Madison Square Garden. Also recorded there was THE BALLAD OF BILLY THE KID. With this album,SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD,originally a TURNSTILES track,became a hit. So did a COLD SPRING HARBOR track,SHE'S GOT A WAY. The album also contains songs from PIANO MAN and STREETLIFE SERENADE. Each title gives its own date and location of recording. Too bad ANGRY YOUNG MAN was not used for this album. Another TURNSTILES track that would be later recycled for Billy's next live album KOHUEPT. There should have been PIANO MAN on this album also.
B000002IM7|4.0|Talk about making a splash on the scene! King's X delivers their unique blend of Drop-D heaviness and gorgeous harmonies in fine form.  Not many debut albums have as much impact as this.  The details of this album really help prop it up as well (beautiful cover art, interesting CD liner).  Not to mention the cool atmospheric intro to \\"In the New Age\\".  Doug is without a doubt one of the finest vocalists in hard rock.  He was leaning more to his soprano side on this one with Jerry (drums) and Ty (guitar) providing beatlesque backing vocals. The lyrics are best described as \\"spiritual\\" or \\"uplifting\\" although some christians insist that the are \\"christian lyrics\\".  The band has/is/was NEVER a \\"Chritian\\" band.. and sadly this label seems to have haunted their career.  That said, I am an atheist so if I can handle the lyrics, they shouldnt bother anyone else. Ty's signature guitar sound is all over this album (he used to hide his guitar amplifier behind various facades to hide its identity).  His solos are refreshing and while brilliant are not overly technical (like say malmstein or steve vai).  The music and voices soar here, great tunes to sing along too, you cant help it otherwise.  \\"King\\", \\"Shot of Love\\", \\"Visions\\", \\"What is this\\", \\"Sometimes\\", and \\"Far Far Away\\" are all instant classics.  Peppered in is also some sitar here and there just giving even more flavor to this album.  The one track I do not like is the song \\"Goldilox\\" which alot of fans absolutely love.  To me it is just a dressed up power ballad, kind of common for the era (granted the band pulls it off better).<br />Hard rock with soul... and amazing vocals, what more do you need to know?
B00001PE4D|4.0|Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses).  Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls.  <br />Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers.  They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome.  The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).<br />However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard.  The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim.  The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.<br />These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers.   In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it.
B00003CXE7|1.0|'Gladiator' pretends to be a great movie, but it didn't fool me.  There not a single original idea in the entire film; an outcast's family is killed by the evil emperor, the outcast trains himself to get revenge, the outcast kills the emperor in the end.  Hasn't this story been told many many times before and with much better acting and storytelling?  I guess millions of other people were fooled because this movie won a bunch of awards and made millions.
0060523794|1.0|There's a lot of fiction in this document.  Hopfully, some of the folks that Lou forced out of IBM in an effort to pad his lifetime income will also provide input.  Folks who have a positive view of Mr. Gerstner's account of his results in turning IBM around, are not aware of the lives he ruined in the process.  If you sack enough people, the results are bound to reflect a temporary profit.  As a work of fiction, this book would have five stars.  However, based upon facts, it is grossly lacking.
B000000WJ2|3.0|If you're the sort who buys solo albums by Rolling Stones members, then  you'd better get this one. But don't get it if you don't have Keith's first album, which is a lot stronger.<br />Now that we have the audience defined, let's talk pros and cons on this album. On the first couple listens, I got the feeling I was listening to unadorned rhythm guitar tracks for Rolling Stones songs that never got recorded. Keith gets a basic band together, but there's no lead guitar or that trade-off on licks that the Stones do so well. Mostly just that open-G chunga-chung Keith chord he's been doing since 1968, and some songs that go totally off, bafflingly, and don't seem to depend on guitar at all.<br />And there are some slow songs that are better left ignored. Unfortunately, anything that Keith did that is musically elementary and depends entirely on his singing to create the song is sure to fail. <br />I'd recommend \\"Talk is Cheap\\" over this one. There are some good cuts, but I can never figure out why superstars put out songs with three lackluster chords, boring words that just have to rhyme, and no substance that stays in your mind even after a couple listenings.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops! I Did It Again show cases better vocals and more of a Britney feel to it. I felt she had more control over this album than her previous album ...Baby One More Time. She comes back with pop songs that make you wanna dance to. My favorite personal song is (What U See Is What) U Get. Overall good album following the same formula as her first album. Good pop music.
B000062YAZ|4.0|first off I purchased reign in blood back in 86/87 when it was on vinyl no cd`s back then.And I thought [wow] this is it .You really cant top this many have tried '''''faster, eviler'' meaner etc.Nothing could dethrone the almighty REIGN IN BLOOD or so I thought.Believe me I have marched with the Slayer army since 1985`s show no mercy album and so on.So now 17 years later having thought thrash was gone ZEKE`S DEATH ALLEY has arrived well it came out in 2001.This aint speed .this is pure meth mixed with gasoline.BELIEVE IT my slayer albums went and hid under the bed when i cranked this bad boy up.do yourself a favor and let the old kings rest in peace.I could spend the next 2hrs writing about ZEKE`S DEATH ALLEY! but hey it`s just a click away DO IT AND  ROT!!!
B000000XB9|5.0|One of the few CD made on the face of this Earth that is worth the price.  CDs are always overpriced, even when they are sold used for 7.99 or 8.99.  Almost all the songs are pure, simple, and unforgettable.  Creedence rocks.  Buy it.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Here it is, Nirvana's greatest hits all in one album. I know a lot of die hard fans of a band like Nirvana don't like Greatist hits because they say it's just a \\"sampling\\" of the music and to be a real fan you need to buy all the albums or box set. Well if your poor, you don't have money to spend on all of Nirvana's albums, so I highly suggest picking up this one instead of buying the others if your low on cash :).
B000099T2L|4.0|I was a little hesitant to purchase her album at first, but after listening to it, I'm glad I did! Beyonce showcases her vocal and lyrical talent, taking you through a rollercoaster of lyrically empowered songs, from the upbeat &quot;crazy in love&quot; to the power ballad with R&amp;B legend Luther Vandross in &quot;The closer I get to you&quot;. Beyonce does an exceptional job, with the right collaborations and sampling, she once again proves to the public that she is an ultimate diva!!
0140042393|4.0|This is a wonderful story that will take you on an often painful journey. The characters are so vivid and one can really emapathize for what they are going through. The story tells the larger story of a nation in transformation. No longer will small farmers be able to compete with large corporations. The spirit and determination of Ma is admirable as she maintains perspective and hope in the face of so many tribulations. This is a story of survival and the strength of family.
B000002OVJ|4.0|I doubt any band could match up to the Who when they played live.  What is amazing here is that its only 4 guys playing.  Nowadays, they have a whole bunch of other people playing with them, so it doesn't have the same feel.<br />What makes 'Live at Leeds' unique is that the songs don't sound like anything on the studio album.  They follow a similar pattern, but are very different.  Its much more interesting to listen to them live, so buy their live albums instead of their studio stuff.
B000099T2L|5.0|I'm sure someone out there is going to not like this CD simply because it's Beyonce's. Before you form an opinion (negative)on something you've never heard, read what I've written and check it out for yourself.  <br />1. Crazy In Love (Feat. Jay-Z) (5) - How can you not like this track? The instrumentation alone is worth the listen.  Jay-Z's bars affirm why he sits at the head of the table of hip hop royalty.          <br />2. Naughty Girl (5) - I really like this one.  The way she changes her vocals from breathy to bold is what moves me the most. <BR>       <BR>3. Baby Boy- (Feat. Sean Paul) (4) - Honestly, I had so much more in mind of what this should have been like.  It's not going to be a \\"CLUB BANGER\\" unless a remix is made but it's cool song. <br />4. Hip Hop Star (Feat. Big Boi & Sleepy Brown) (4.5) - How can you not like Big Boi's verse?  He brings his ATL swagger onto the track and almost takes it over.  <br />5. Be With You - (5) If you're a hopeless romantic, this cut is for you.  Reminiscent of the Bootsy Collins hit \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" it's a sultry ballad that aches to be heard. <BR> <BR>6. Me, Myself And I (5) -  This one is all for the ladies. I'm sure plenty women will be able to relate to this (unfortunately).  It's not about male-bashing but instead affirmation of self-worth.        <br />7. Yes (4.5) - Yet another track for the ladies. Beyonce stresses the importance of making sure the gentleman is truly the right one in all aspects.  <BR>    <BR>8. Signs (Feat. Missy Elliott) (5) - I could speculate with the rest of the media who the Sagittarius in the song is but I'll leave it alone. Beyonce shows appreciation to all the fellas (by their zodiac) on this one.  <BR>        <BR>9. Speechless (5) - One word--SEXY!  I can't describe this, you have to hear for yourself. <BR>       <BR>10. That's How You Like It (Feat. Jay-Z) (4.5) - Another fun track with Jay-Z. I don't agree with the placement but it would only seem right since the first trackalso has \\"Young Hov\\" as it's guest star.  <BR>        <BR>11. The Closer I Get To You (Duet With Luther Vandross) (5) - I'll admit that I as skeptical about this song. The original is one of my favorites and I wondered if this duet would do it any justice. Beyonce gives a sample of her true vocal range and gives the critics a bit of crow to eat.  Luther as always was phenomenal.  <BR>       <BR>12. Dangerously In Love 2 (5) - I was hoping for the live version of this song to make the final release of the album but I won't complain. I felt this song when I heard it on the \\"SURVIVOR\\" album (Destiny's Child) and I still relate to it now.  The intro is a little different but the words and emotion remain constant.       <br />13. Beyoncé Interlude (5) - Brief but poetic.<BR>          <BR>14. Gift From Virgo  (5) - Really melodic. Very light tune with lots of harmony. It exudes emotion.  <br />BONUS:<br />*I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE: Finally Miss Knowles faces those who constantly call themselves having an \\"opinion\\" about her life and what she does.  It's a classy delivery but the message is CLEAR.  <br />*DADDY: If I had a child, I would want him/her to feel this way about me: ENOUGH SAID! <br />BOTTOM LINE: Beyonce is an extremely talented young lady.  Don't allow the opinions of others sway you from purchasing this album and treating yourself to what she has to offer.

B00005Y228|5.0|I rate Kylie Monogue 5 stars because she has great singing talent.  Love her so much.  Never tire of her singing ever.
B00009V7T2|2.0|This album is testimony to the truth that all those hours you spent as a teen locked in your room playing air guitar will eventually come back to haunt you. I don't know much about these guys, but it's clear that there some serious metalhead residue lingering here. Naturally, since metalheads are viewed as bottom feeders in terms of musical tastes, these guys strive very hard to prove themselves worthy of a higher status. Eclectism is the new redeeming virtue and all the rage, so they eagerly opt for that. However, no matter how well they dress it up, they most basic influences are still in clear view.<br />I suppose they call this emo because it's got those annoying, high-pitched, nasally vocals that is considered &quot;emotive&quot; but in M.V. vocalist Bixler's case, sounds most of the time like a spastic and very effeminate version of Maynard James Keenan. That's not the end of the Tool presence here (perhaps a bit of Carcass too -- who knows?), which is found in the lyrics, song titles and artwork to a noticeable extent. And when Bixler's not doing his whiny Keenan thing, he sounds like any one of a number of very bad New Wave of Heavy Metal vocalists from bands best lost to history. No surprise then that there more than a few unmistakable Iron Maiden moments littered through the disc. <br />As for the songs -- it's the return of prog rock: complicated for complicated's sake. It's a mish-mashed, crazy quilt style of pastiche, stringing together or layering different musical ideas without interest in complementariness. Case in point: &quot;drunkship of lanterns&quot; is about as coherent and cohesive as its title suggests. It begins with a hyper-paced Santana-ish grindgroove, with bits of rockish quips and esoteric winks dancing about and Bixler screeching about god knows what on top, then it collapses into something that sounds like free jazz but isn't really, then shifts back to the previous uptempo hodge-podge it started with. It's a holy mess of a song on anepic Emerson Lake and Palmer scale. So too is &quot;cicatriz esp,&quot; which tries to slow down in midsong into a jazzy interlude that's more reminiscent of Iron Maiden's &quot;Strange World&quot; than anything jazz that then flips into something that sounds suspiciously like Sabbath's pre-electronica &quot;FX&quot; before hoolaing off into another Santana-esque whirlwind. At their most coherent, the songs on this album are something like eclectized Incubus (which is suburbanized Nirvana, which is..., etc.), and the lyrics, when not being pretentious (it doesn't get more pretentious than &quot;You must have been phlegmatic in stature&quot;), are adolescent. The guitar solong/noodling that often tries to be jazzy (I have to comment of this, being a guitarist) is flashy, noisy and ultimately distracting and useless -- think really vapid Scofield imitations by a graceless rock musician who's listened to too much heavy metal. <br />I'm giving this album two stars because, like any pretentious prog rock opus, it had to take a generous and impressive amount of effort and determination (and hubris) to pull the whole byzantine operation off. But beyond that I can seriously pass on this CD. Plenty have already been dazzled by this band, and I'm sure there'll be more. However, for me, it's too much faux jazz, too much nonsense and too many Tool and Maiden flashbacks all at once, and it leaves me tired and far from dazzled.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets struck me as a significantly better movie than the first Harry Potter film.  The first movie was thrilling, giving us the first look with the naked eye of the setting already firmly lodged in the imaginative minds of Rowling's readers, but the fact that audiences are now quite familiar with both Hogwarts and the colorful characters who reside there allows for the plot to exert greater control over everything that happens.  Surely, there are little sidetracks along the way, but the tension builds continually toward the almost inevitable conclusion of the film.  I will admit that one can find a few weak spots if not holes in the plot, but this fact does little to diminish the overall effectiveness of the film.  Just as Rowling's writing draws you in to Harry Potter's world, so does this movie.  It's rather amazing to see just how much the heroic triumvirate of Harry, Ron, and Hermione have matured, but they are still the same friends we left behind at the end of Year One.  The late Richard Harris is once again the perfect Dumbledore, Professor Snape is even more Snape-ish that before, and Draco Malfoy is somehow even more unbearable.  Along with all of the beloved characters we already know and love (or hate), a new set of important personages now enters Harry's world.  The conceited egomaniac Professor Lockhart is a fascinating, albeit increasingly annoying, wizard, while Dobby the house elf is a well-animated, exceedingly sympathetic little guy who never fails to liven up the action around him.  No one looms larger, however, than Lucius Malfoy, whose dark and looming presence comes through immediately on first sight and lingers until the very end.  Important storylines for both now and the future begin to emerge, helping to pave the way for successive films.  The special effects are really well done indeed, the music works perfectly, and the movie succeeds admirably in following the storyline of the book on which it is based.  I would imagine that young readers are particularly fond of this film, as its variety of special effects, from the flying car to the increasingly exciting action above the Quidditch field to the amazing effects of drinking Polyjuice Potion, offers a lot of delightfully memorable moments.<br />The DVD features are excellent, much better than those found on the DVD of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  You don't have to jump through hoops to see all of the deleted scenes, there is a fun and informative look at the making of the movie; the tour of Dumbledore's office comes off nicely, and a number of interviews with Rowling, Chris Columbus, the actors and actresses, as well as some of the individuals in charge of creating the incredible look and feel of the movie are quite interesting to watch.  A number of other activities, particularly among the DVD-ROM features, offer both adults and children a fun and easy way to linger in Harry's world for some time rather than leave immediately upon viewing the movie.<br />I haven't gone into detail here about the film because there's really no need to.  Quite simply, this is just a great film.  No longer are we and Harry oohing and aahing around every corner of the school corridors; the days of innocence and play are over as Hogwarts faces the prospect of closing.  The darkness that will continually work its way into the Harry Potter storyline, greatly increasing the depth of even the most familiar of characters, begins in the Chamber of Secrets.I would imagine that young readers are particularly fond of this film, as its variety of special effects, from the flying car to the increasingly exciting action above the Quidditch field to the amazing effects of drinking Polyjuice Potion, offers a lot of delightfully memorable moments.<br />The DVD features are excellent, much better than those found on the DVD of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

6305252521|5.0|...for the better or worse.<br />This movie represents something that is not real. It is fiction. The premiss is, however, real. If there was a show on, where you got to follow a young man growing up, and living his life, there would be a LOT of people watching. Some people WOULD more or less put their lives on hold during significant moments of the show. This is the sheer brilliance of this movie. And rest assured: This movie is excellent.<br />There have been arguments that a show of this kind would not be followed, if it were real life, with audiences being fickle. The thing is that the show changes. Christof (a superb Ed Harris) has thrown in all kinds of things happening to Truman (Will we ever see Jim Carrey better? I don't think I could take that in!), nothing majorly life-altering, but subtle changes, which keeps up the dynamics of the show.<br />And come on! If you don't think that people could get that involved: Just look at stuff like Big Brother. For some reason, people seem to want more. (Hey, they've brought it back four times) People want things that can help them take their mind off things. People WANT to watch \\"perfect\\" worlds. Otherwise shows like \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" and games like \\"The Sims\\" would not exist. \\"The Sims\\" is, more or less, your own little Truman Show.<br />As for \\"people putting their lives on hold\\" to convince Truman that what he sees is real... It's called acting, and I think they would be paid pretty well.<br />All in all: this is what producers of \\"reality shows\\" do to the participants on a daily basis. The participants emerge (from a Big Brother house or similar) only to see that the producers have done exactly whatever they want with the participants' lives. In essence, a lot of the people who go into a \\"Big Brother\\" house, are going to have their lives wrecked. The producers can do exactly anything they want, in that respect.´<br />What is actually the most chilling aspect of the ending is the two security guards, who simply switch from watching a person whose life has been led by someone else, to saying \\"So what else is on?\\" This gives me the creeps, because this is as close as you can get to modern television \\"moral.\\" Truman's life, after having been watched for over 30 years, is worth nothing more than the press of a button.

B000092ZYX|5.0|What can I say about Thom Yorke's voice that hasn't already been said?  It is truly an instrument of catharsis for me which started with Paranoid Android six years ago.<BR>Hail to the Thief is truly a masterpiece.  Yes,I'm not the first to say it,and I'm not hopping on a bandwagon.  I didn't care for Kid A. I know many loved it,and it did have its place in Radiohead's development,but to me it felt like I was invited to dinner but then kept standing at the front door. I never warmed to it. I loved Amnesiac, which was more accessible for me, but lacked something that I couldn't quite figure out till I heard this new collection.  What I'm hearing on Hail to the Thief is the butterfly emerging from the cocoon of the past five years.  I think I'm hearing Thom finally feeling comfortable in his own skin. This album is truly transporting...open up and you'll be taken on a journey that will leave you speechless.<BR>2+2=5,Sail to the Moon,Go to Sleep,Where I End and You Begin,I Will,Myxomatosis,Scatterbrain and A Wolf at the Door are some of the finest songs Radiohead have produced in many years.  There's a newfound confidence I'm hearing in these and other tracks(some of which drag but add necessary tension).  And yes...Radiohead still know how to rock.<BR>Then of course there's THERE THERE....When I first heard this song I was so compelled to close my eyes,move my body and bang my head that I literally did bang my head....ouch! I don't mind the bump on the head,cause this album also has balm for my heart.
B000002URV|5.0|I picked up this album after listening to my brother's copy of Cross of Changes and really liking it, and it quickly became my favourite. It's hard to describe what really goes on in your mind when listening to Enigma, just that it's all good. The impeccable balance between genres of music and combining completely different sounds, creating a wonderous result just exceeds explanation.<br />The standout track, in my opinion, is mea culpa, with Sandra Cretu's luscious, raunchy, vocals with that driving beat. I must admit, this track highlights a bias in me, there is something special about the French language, I reckon. Other tracks that are also great are Principles of Lust, with its great chants and really cool 'lyrics' about lust and love, and the last track that has hints of Cross in it.<br />Listen to this CD when going home from work/school/uni, or as I found out in my last year at high school, when doing study - absolutely fantastic stuff.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Prior to seeing it for the first time in a theatre, I knew that this film had been a project which had taken director Scorcese about 30 years to complete; also, that a replication of much of mid-19th century New York City (notably the Five Points area) had been created within the vast Cinecitta studio complex in Rome. After sitting through another viewing of this 168-minute film, my thoughts and feelings remained mixed. Pluses? Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of William (\\"Bill the Butcher\\") Cutting, the various sets which seem like archival photos brought to life, the creation of an ongoing (almost subliminal) sense of menace, and the skillful use of historical material concerning political corruption, emergence of the so-called \\"melting pot\\" culture, Civil War conscription, race riots, etc. This context helps to explain the nature and extent of the bloody hostilities between Cutting's Native Americans and Vallon's Dead Rabbits.<br />However, this film also has a few weaknesses which include what I view as DiCaprio's hollow portrayal of Priest Vallon's son, Amsterdam, who returns to avenge his father's murder after years of severe abuse in an orphanage. Scorcese's preparations for Amsterdam's final, inevitable confrontation with Cutting should have been as sharp as one of \\"Bill the Butcher's\\" carving knives...but aren't. Stated another way, the pacing of the narrative seems to me disjointed and thus much less effective than it could and should have been. Also, I think some of the scenes are too busy, too crowded for no apparent reason. I'm not referring to street scenes which are generally handled very well.<br />One last opinion, more a quibble than a complaint: I wish Scorcese had done more with Neeson's character prior to his death which occurs so early in the film just as I wish Shakespeare had revealed just a bit more about Hamlet's father. I can easily understand why Cutting has always been the unquestioned leader of the Native Americans. Ironically, when reminiscing about Priest Vallon, \\"Bill the Butcher\\" seems to think more of him than Scorcese does....certainly more of him than Scorcese allows his audience to.cing about Priest Vallon, \\"Bill the Butcher\\" seems to think more of him than Scorcese does....certainly more of him than Scorcese allows his audience to.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead will never stink! They cant make anything bad. A great album whatsoever. I rate it as a must have 5 stars.
B000002J23|2.0|well much as I would like to have been a yes fan I felt that at the time the albumn covers were probably the most inspiring thing about the band. As I say the covers and this is probably the least imaginative one reflects the music. In spite of the virtuoso performances of the individual band members this like most of yes work comes across very strongly as a group of individuals out to out perform each other. <BR>I even saw this performed live in edinburgh and just like the album it ends up giving you a headache. <BR>As mentioned Horn and the other guy were subconded to the band which in previous albumns had managed to produce something musical although mostly disjointed. It was very apparent that they were still acting as a group by themselves and it really is a credit to the original members that they managed to produce anything above average. <BR>I bought the albumn when it was released and was looking at it the other day as I am transcribing my lps onto cd (old age). I was tempted to chuck the albumn in the bin.
0441009425|4.0|A very good debut novel by Alastair Reynolds. I really think that the book could've been edited by about 100 pages as it took a little while to get going. Once all the characters and plotlines get together the novel races to a stunning and satisfying conclusion. The novel could easily be adapted to the big screen especially with the cinematic ending. Lots of cool science fiction concepts are crammed into the book. There is lots of room to develop many sequels or just stories set in this interesting universe. Read it.
B00008DDXC|3.0|I think they missed alot of parts from the book that could of been added to the movie. But other than that okay.

B00006879E|5.0|I listened to a few Maroon5 songs because I knew they would be playing at a Jason Mraz concert I was going to, and I was curious to see how they sounded.  At first, I was not impressed.  Though, their live performace completely blew me away.  Lead singer Adam Levine was so intense, passionate, and sexy, not to mention his vocals was incredible.  Also, the lead guitarist was a true wizard of his craft, his playing was spellbinding.  Seeing such an amazing band live is awesome, and I recommend seeing them live if you ever get the chance.  If you can't, get the cd  While they are one of the few bands 10 times better in concert than in studio recording, the cd is also amazing.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I loved Moulin Rouge, but I'm sorry, this movie is better. I saw it 8 times in the theater, and am anxiously awaiting it's release on DVD. The actors are unbelievable! Catherine Zeta-Jones can Sing (and dance)!!! Renee Zellweger can Sing! Richard Gere can sing (and tap)! It's so mesmorizing. I just stare at the screen in awe. It could not be any better, it's as simple as that.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love this cd.  I was pleasantly surprised at it.  It is very mature, without sounding too old for her.  My favs are:  The Closer I Get To You.  (How can you go wrong with Luther?), Yes, Speechless, Crazy In Love, Dangerously In Love 2, Be With You, Naughty Girl.  I guess that's about the entire cd huh?  Her production is on point and never over the top.  I feel that she will definately go far with this cd.  Even though I love Destiny's Child, I feel she surpasses the usually girly sound you expect from them.

B000002U8G|5.0|Brilliant. What can I say more about this tune??? \\"Echoes\\" came just at the right time and the right place. Without it, I think I would've rated this album 3 out of 10. The song started out slow which is the intro. Then, the song shifts to the verses, with the detached vocals, and suddenly changing fast the intensity of the tune. The memorable guitar solo suddenly shifts to a strange, tribal kind of rhythm. But just when you're starting to get nervous and tired, the tune changes to a funky, fancy section. The guitar is roaring here, drenched clearly in reverb, delay, and distortion. The organ here is also fiery, probably the best from Mr. Wright, and Roger's bass part is also sustaining well the number, so as Mason's part. Again, just as you're getting bored, the song sunken into this strange pterodactyl noise driving part. The noises are from Gilmour's echoing high-pitched guitar. The wind is from Waters's bass. He used a technique that consists of using a slide and gliding it on the, believe it or not, bass strings. Once more, when you start getting irritated, the Farfisa Organ fades angelically, slowly in. Then, the gong bangs hard, with the rhythmic guitar in the background, creating a helicopter-like sound. This part can easily be compared to Chinese music. Then, suddenly, the band plays like some sort of wind or tornado is building up. Reaching its peak, the wind disappears and fades directly back to the intro theme, with the angelic vocals of Gilmour and Wright. Truly brilliant and well arranged. The song then builds some momentum, to find itself back to the soft intro that launched the tune. The song fades slowly out with the wind effect, this time coming from the studio effects. Whew!! Indeed what a resume!! <BR>Now lets go on to the instruments. I believe the technique Rick used to create the rain drops on the intro and the end is by processing a grand piano through a Leslie Organ rotating speaker, the ones used for the Hammond Organ. The way Gilmour playsthe guitar on the funky bit is out of my comprehension. Even I can't play it!! (Although I sometimes come close...) I think he's using fully feedback along with reverb and delay to pen the solo (As I mentioned above).  Nick's drum work here is also at best, with full of syncope (If you have the chance, view the Pompeii-version of Echoes and you can clearly see Nick at his best...). Roger's bass is also incredible. I guess at the end of the song he would have cramps in his left wrist!! Finally, in all, \\"Echoes\\" is probably their finest work ever, the most well arranged, but surprisingly never reaching success in America. So it's no surprising that their greatest hits album, released on November of 2001, is entitled \\"Echoes: the best of Pink Floyd\\". For those who are fans of Pink Floyd and don't know \\"Echoes\\", shame on you!! And for those who like Pink Floyd, but dislike \\"Echoes\\", shame on you too!! I think if someone would ask me \\"What is Pink Floyd and how to they play?\\" I would say \\"Listen to \\"Echoes\\", from the album \\"Meddle\\" and you'll talk to me later.\\" Because Echoes encapsulates the band's sound, and it would be safe enough to say that it is their signature song.
B00008DDXC|1.0|i hated this movie so much<BR>the kid who plays ron is possible the most annoying actor ever <BR>the special effects in this movie were terrible <BR>this movie is a disgrace to the book <BR>and the only reason why it did at all well is because of little kids who don't know a good movie from a bad one<BR>i would give it no stars if i had the option
B00004U2G4|4.0|Fine blusy guitar work by Jeff Beck on his fine debut solo recording. Not to mention some excellent wailing by Rod The Bod Stewart. Rock My Plimsoul and Aint Superstitious are the ultiamte highlights featuring Rod and Jeff. To think this man would record such schlock as Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?  Some nice piano touches by Nicky Hopkins particularly on Blues Deluxe.<br />There are a few moments the band strays away from the blues.  Like the acoustic treatment of Greensleeves.  Old Man River however just seems a little out of place. Shape Of Things is a little haphazard but still features some fine playing by Beck.<br />If you are a fan of the blues and want to hear some legendary guitar performances, pick this one up for sure.
B00008XEOI|5.0|I am not the type of guy that often watch animated movies.  I enjoy movies like \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"The Lord of The Rings,\\" to name a few.  After I watched \\"The Lion King\\"  I was surprised and was in awe about the story, soundtrack, and the overall feel of the movie.  I could not believe that for the first time I enjoyed watching an animated movie.  This movie is the epitome of family entertainment captured in a DVD disk.  It's one of the many reasons that make a weekend movie viewing with the rest of the people you love worthwhile.  It's a phonomenal movie.  Two thumbs up.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead continues to ignore the rules and instead plots their own course.  The overall description of the album could probably best be described as somewhere in between OK and Amnesiac, but don't be expecting OK Computer revisted.  This album has it's own distinct, haunting sound.  You have to respect these guys for going out and making albums that differ greatly from the Bends and then later OK Computer after the success of each of those two albums.  Instead of resting on their laurels and rehasing the exact same sounds Radiohead continues to push the envelope. 10 out of 10
B000099T2L|2.0|by the looks of the first single i thought this was a sure hit, but it fell a little short. the only hot singles are the ones with jay-z. sean paul collabo, missy and big boi were half assed! the signs tracks were cheesy. tracks me myself and i was cool. doesn't matter cuz it'll still be the heavy hitter this week, but i would download it rather than pick it up if i were you, but pick up that monica!

B00005BJPO|5.0|I am never one to take the time to type out an editorial review or anything like that. However watching Akira I have changed. It has a deep and involving plot line which, I will not write about here; as many other people already have done so, completely immerses the viewer into its animated splendor. This movie is absolutely beautifully drawn and the character depth is really QuitE amazing. The storyline, admittedly, is a little hard to follow, so if you value intelligent and HIGHLY original plotlines then PURCHASE THIS MOVIE. To fully understand and enjoy it's DEEP messages and little fun things that you can pick out (much too many little brilliant things to mention) this movie must be watched more than once or twice. Akira is a movie that can be enjoyed over and over and over again. 5 stars are not enough in my books for this movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;But the fact is that this CD is tuneless pop with no dance songs&quot;  Ok, so because they aren't the Back Street Boys you are going to give them 1 star?  This is one of the best albums of the past 20 years and deserves nothing less than 5 stars.  Go back to your N'Sync kid, this isn't a dance album, its called great music.
B000005HN6|5.0|No words can descibe this....    My first Opeth purchace was \\"My Arms....\\", and as much as I hate to say it, I wasn't all that impressed. I then read some reviews of the Death Metal super group Bloodbath, and decided to buy that. It totally blew me away. That is one of the best Death Metal releases I've ever heard....    After being so impressed with that, I decided to give Opeth another shot. I then purchaced \\"Still Life\\". This was the Opeth I was expecting from the start, and that's a very impressive release.....    After hearing \\"Still Life\\", and liking it, I wanted to expand my Opeth collection. I then proceeded to read reviews, and after hearing such good things about \\"Orchid\\", I bought it as well. I waited a long time for this to come, and once it did, I popped it in immediately.....    IMO, \\"Orchid\\" is the best Opeth release I've heard yet. This is just so beautiful, I can't really descibe how wonderful it is. It's got an incredible melodic feel, along with some of the best songs I've ever heard. The musicianship is flawless, and these guys are truly in a class of their own.     \\"Orchid\\" was the Opeth I was looking for from the start, and I'm now proud to say that I'm hooked on Opeth, and everything they put their name on. These guys are the best Death Metal band in the world right now IMO. Nobody can touch the pure brilliance this band produces......    \\"Orchid\\" really hit me hard, and this is one of the most beautiful Death Metal releases I've ever heard. This is easily worth five stars. If you can pick this up, I highly, very highly recommend you buy it as soon as possible....
B00004XONN|5.0|It's not poppy, it's not radio friendly, it's nothing like their previous two albums, but it's perfect.  It may take a few listens to get over the initial shock, but it's worth it.  It's great start to finish.  &quot;How to disappear completely&quot; I find especially moving.  They way Radiohead completely deconstructed their music and came up with this gem is especailly impressive.
B000099T2L|5.0|The much anticipated solo release by Beyonce has everything fans want and expect from this Destiny's Child main diva. The 14 songs reflect a wide range of music influences including awsome dance beats, soulful sounds and classic R&B pieces. Guests on the Cd include JZi, Sean Paul and Missy Elliot, producing some of the best cuts. However B carries herself perfectly all on her own. Beyonces talent as a singer, song writer and producer come through clearly, establishing her as one of the best entertainer's of the year. My favorite songs include: Crazy in Love, Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, Be with you and Signs. The only thing that is missing from the album is the signature Gospel song (present on all 4 Destiny's Child CD's). Nonethless this CD is most likely one of the best Summer releases and it is sure to bring Beyonce to the top of the charts. Good luck Beyonce! Great job (DC3 rules)<BR>BUY THIS CD!!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|Forget the current forget France movement, this movie will take you to a touching, imaginative world where it all does come out right in the end as long as you believe.  <br />Look up Van Gogh self-portaits when you're done, you'll laugh again.
B00008H2LB|5.0|There's really not much to say except Linkin Park have lived up to all expectations and then surpassed them to create a memorable and thoroughly enjoyable album. Meteora is a compact, well-produced and tightly worked album and its content by far outweighs any possible complaints of its length. It's great to see that there is a band out there that takes the time to make every single song on the album worth listening to, there is not one bad song on this record. Having said that, stand-out tracks inlcude 'Breaking the Habit', 'Don't Stay', 'Somewhere I belong' 'Lying from You' and 'Numb'.<br />Meteora has good lyrics, great melodies and hard beats, combining rock, hip-hop and electronica intricately but effortlessly, all the while highlighting the great chemistry between the band members. I really couldn't have asked for more.
B00000263T|5.0|Metal Heart is a fantastic heavy metal album from 1985. It should have opened Accept to the masses in the United States. However, some die-hard fans thought the album was too commercial and the metal mainstream was more into less talented but decent bands like Ratt and Bon Jovi. Too bad. Metal Heart is a classic metal album and Accept at their best.<br />One mistake that may have cost Metal Heart more popularity was the choice of \\"Midnight Mover\\" as the first single/video. While \\"Midnight Mover\\" was a decent track, the video which was a live performance with its constant around the clock camera shots was a dud. Also, \\"Screaming For A Love Bite\\" was easily the catchiest track on the album and with the right push could have been a hit. The heavier tracks on the album such as \\"Wrong Is Right\\", \\"Too High to Get It Right\\", and \\"Dogs On Leads\\" are absolutely killer. The mid-tempo \\"Living For Tonite\\" and \\"Up To The Limit\\" are also strong tracks. Udo Dirkschneider's signature growl is in fine form throughout the album.  But the biggest highlights are provided by their underrated lead guitarist Wolf Hoffman. His unaccompanied solo on the title track and his classically influenced solos on the closing track \\"Bound To Fail\\" are heavy metal guitar playing at its best. Accept would make heavier albums than this like Death Row and Restless and Wild, but neither album is as consistent as Metal Heart. Definitely recommended for fans of melodic heavy metal with a rough edge.

B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce is a go-getter and she certainly takes bold and admirable steps with her debut CD. There are certain cuts that stand out and have become favorites (The Closer I Get To You, Yes, and Signs); some of the other selections are gonna take a few more listens (Me, Myself and I, and Hip-Hop Star). They are not immediately captivating and it could be because the melodies are different (yet they are nice and do stand out in terms of what every other singer is doing these days). I think the production of this CD is excellent. I love what I construe as Beyonce's confidence - she doesn't seem afraid to take risks, and it seems she is carving out a niche for herself. I would buy her future CD's.
B000002OX3|4.0|Here we have the Who's second album, which established a non-precedent by having songs written by all four members. All of Pete's contributions are great (no surprise). The showpiece of the album is Pete's first rock opera, the nine minute \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\". John's two songs really show off his dark sense of humor. Keith contributes the not very good \\"I Need You\\" and the demented instrumental \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\". Roger's sole contribution is the mediocre pop song \\"See My Way\\". There is also an adequate cover of Martha & the Vandellas \\"Heat Wave\\" that feels a bit out of place here.  This CD also features a whopping ten bonus tracks. The Who are just having fun with the \\"Batman\\" theme. Then we have two cover songs that demonstrate Keith's love for surf music. \\"Disguises\\" is another swell song by Pete. Then we have two amusing b-sides by John. \\"In the City\\" is a rather bad song by Keith, with a little help from John. The acoustic version of \\"Happy Jack\\" here is great, but why isn't the single version included? After all, it was on the U.S. version of the original album. Then we have a cover version of an Everly Brothers song. Finally, the CD ends with a bizarre medley of \\"My Generation\\" and \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\". All in all, a fun CD.
0783114222|5.0|In this stunning portrayal of the greatest period of exploration in human history--and it should be said that the Apollo program was nothing less than that--two great themes permeate the tale:<br />1.  the compelling nature of the quest to voyage from the Earth to the Moon.<BR>2.  the power &amp; value of human intellect and education<br />The concluding episode has a scene in which the character who links the episodes together, the fictional TV anchor Emmett Seaborn, observes--correctly, I think--that we went to the moon simply to take those awe-inspiring photographs; to prove to ourselves that we could do it.  The other reasons for the Apollo program, to beat the Soviets, and the other political reasons and scientific, were secondary and perhaps even trivial when compared to the sheer compulsion to do it, a compulsion energized by what may have been President Kennedy's greatest single speech, given in 1962 at Rice University, the speech in which he challenged &amp; committed the United States to send a man to the moon &amp; return him safely to Earth by the end of that decade.<br />The other great theme, that of the value &amp; power of the intellect, was wonderfully illuminated by the portrayal of the field geology lessons given to a number of the Apollo astronauts by one Professor Lee Silver of Caltech.  It is not often that intellectual endeavors are portrayed in popular dramatic productions.  But it was the geological exploration of the Moon which gave those voyages--especially the last few--invaluable scientific results and a focus of activity for the astronauts while on the lunar surface.<br />Viewing this series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; reminded me of  how fortunate I am to have lived during the time of the Apollo missions, the truly great adventure in the history of mankind.
630018403X|5.0|The Breakfast Club (1985)is by far the most important teen movie ever. It shows five very different high school students joined together in a Saturday detention for a variety of reasons, and for the entire day, they are STUCK together with no way out. There is the jock Andy (Emilio Estevez), the princess Claire (Molly Ringwald), the metalhead Bender (Judd Nelson), the basketcase Allison (Ally Sheedy), and the nerdy straight A student Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), five very different personalities, egos and reasons for being here (skipping class, firearms, constant rebellion, bullying and ennui), so they get to know each other, which was a hard process because all 5 of them seemed set in their ways. <br />John Hughes looked into a very poignant and important part in the many stereotypical students of a stereotypical high school, from egos, pressures, pain, and exactly how all teenagers face the same things but in various forms. Social barriers are somewhat broken, by 5 people who would normally have nothing to do with each other, and their detention has a rather positive effect, but I kinda wished that the movie were longer to see what would happen to them when they saw each other on Monday in school. If only high school were really like this... the world would be a better place.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Let me say that Tom Welling should be given the Superman role for the upcoming movie. He is the first \\"Clark Kent\\" who does the character justice.<br />I've read comics all my life, some handed down by my brothers and I know that this Clark is the best by far. He is a real person. ...<br />Smallville on a whole has the most excellent cast, everyone adds something unique and irreplaceable. I wouldn't change a thing. Right down to the song selections deserves praise. <br />Admittedly, some episodes stretch things in order to create villians for Clark to deal with BUT think about it, we have the Hulk from gamma radiation (which coincidentally kills) and the Fantastic Four getting powers from rolling around in space (again in radiation), so why be so critical if a T.V show seeks to create villians by the same flight of fantasy?<br />The scripting for the first season is excellent, Lex is concise, succint and executes his part with innate ease and precision. Kristin and Tom are perfect together and if they do make a movie I think she should be Lois and he, Clark/Supes... they are too dynamic to separate! They are extremely convincing and are the core of what drives the show - his/her search for the truth of their parents/place in this world.<br />Otherwise, his parents are very real, they teach him real values and have characters that you can identify with. For family value this series is one of the best. Also, Alison Mack (Chloe) and Sam Jones (Pete) give the high calibre performances - which seem totally in keeping with their natural inclinations/character/personalities. <br />The best thing about it all is that Smallville is a living breathing community. It has synergy! You must NOT skip seeing this DVD or the next, for the 2nd season is even better!
B00008AOS5|4.0|I was expecting this movie to be the typical boring american blockbuster movie that people said it's the movie of the year when it's soooo boring but Red Dragon can be a movie of the year, I was very surprise at how good it was.  The performance of Norton and Fiennes is very good but Hopkin it's so so, I just don't understand him, like Fiennes we understand why he did what he did but not Lecter.  Norton always seem tired, he was good but he should act more powerful, he seem like too tired.  Well Red Dragon was much better then Silence of the Lamb in my point of view but both are creepy.  I don't know but I didn't like Silence of the Lamb but I had like Red Dragon.
B00009EIQE|4.0|If you are not familiar with country blues and you enjoy Buddy Guy, get this album.  If I want to listen to country blues, I'll probably play Charley Patton or Robert Johnson more often than this CD, but it does a great favor for bringing new fans to the blues. And if you enjoy this album, then you can look for those who recorded the original versions, whom influenced Buddy himself. If someone thinks that Buddy would do an acoustic album of old country songs for marketing reasons, well, he doesnt know much about marketing.
B0000931QA|5.0|This was the album that showed everyone outside of their fanbase that Queensryche had what it takes to be one of the greatest bands of all time! This is one of those rare albums where everything clicks and is put together so well that after the last track ends the only word that can come to mind is &quot;brilliant&quot;. My personal favorites are Revolution Calling, The Mission, I Don't Believe In Love, and Eyes of a Sranger. <BR>Keep in mind though, this album is telling a story and you have to listen from beginning to end - but you won't mind because every track is a winner and shows the band's diversity - from the title track welcoming you into the Revolution to the haunting Suite Sister Mary to the sadness of Waiting For 22 before the grand finale - this album is a true winner and so far no other band has ever come close to the powerful concept of Mindcrime.
B00005KFZD|5.0|Natty Dread is the best of the Bob Marley bunch. Although I've read some glowing reviews of Exodus and Catch A Fire (which I agree with) this album exceeds the others in my opinion. From the unbelieveably catchy, Lively Up Yourself, to the inspiring, Revolution, this album hits all the spots you want and expect from a great reggae album. My personal favourite, Rebel Music, is a fun and humorous tune with a clasic beat and wonderful cadence. Get it and enjoy.
B00006J3WH|5.0|\\"Once more with Feeling,\\" a musical adaptation from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" Season Five, is absolutely wonderful.  The collective works, lyrics and music by Joss Whedon, arrangements by Christophe Beck, performances by the regular cast, are so perfect and so satisfying (and should be to most \\"Buffy\\" fans) that it is difficult to understand why (discounting the tremendous effort required) the BtVS emsemble didn't create other musical episodes.  But then the series might have evolved into another \\"Cop Rock\\" (\\"Slayer Rock?\\"), and television can survive well without another \\"Cop Rock.\\"  My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed (many times) the CD and the accompanying workbook, which includes commentary, photos, shooting script, and sheet music.  These two (soundtrack and documentation) are a must for the collections of all real \\"Buffy\\" aficionados.
B00009V7T2|5.0|a simply amazing album.  i was nervous when i bought this, thinking that it would be too much of a departure from atdi's sound.  it's definately a departure, but rodriguez and bixler have created something far more interesting.  you can struggle all you want to try and label their sound.  bottom line is that the mars volta is one of the most creative and progressive rock bands out right now.  the opening track really grabbed me and held me in for the rest of the album.  it rocks just as hard as any atdi, but creatively, they reach a little farther.  its hard to tell if the fact that rick rubin produced this makes it automaticly impressive to hear.  but nonetheless, the production quality is amazing.  they really did a good job capturing the experimentation of synthesizers and keyboards fused into heavily distorted guitars.  as far as the concept of the album goes, its a little over my head, and its impossible to follow what cedric is singing about.  it sounds like they tweaked the pitch of his voice a little.  it sounds higher than i've ever heard on any other recordings.  but its beautiful.  he doesnt scream once on the whole cd.  its all melodic and blends well with the keyboards.  i have no doubt that the mars volta is going to blow up with this album.  something this good cant be kept a secret.
0684833395|5.0|This is quite possibly the best book that I have ever read.  Heller's first novel isn't a classic because it's old or the dying fart of some well-respected author--its a classic because its hilarious and at the same time dark, because its meaningful and at the same time completely irrational.  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fans rejoice, because this is the book that sired it.  This is what black humor ought to be--and frankly, everyone who's read this book knows it!  It's zany, its fun, but its also worth your time.  Catch-22 turns life--and war--inside out and laughs at it.  Its philosophy: \\"to live forever or die trying\\"!  Read it; you couldn't possibly be disappointed!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|DONNIE DARKO got a very limited release in 2001 because it dealt with an airplane crashing.  Not that the movie had any other connections to terrorist acts, but that was enough to stifle this well-made indie flick in its theatrical run.  But the DVD brings it to life in a very full way, and with LOADS of extras.<br />The story is twisting and would make David Lynch's head spin!  Donnie is just your average all-American teen who sees big evil bunny rabbits on golf courses telling him about a coming apocalypse.  He survives a plane engine hitting his house thanks to his visions.  He may or may not be schizophrenic, or touched in a special way.  He commits violent destructive crimes in his sleep, but they bring retribution somehow.  And he may or may not be seeing destiny forming in front of his family - I mean this literally in a physical sense.  Is he crazy?  Is he a savior?  Maybe both.<br />The cast is SUPERB!  Drew Barrymore who also produced, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wylie, Catharine Ross, and Beth Grant all make strong use of their characters.  The movie is bursting with eccentric well-constructed characters from Donnie's family to his friends.  There are no weak links here!<br />And technically the movie is beautiful.  Set in the mid 80s, the production design is dead on with just small touches here and there.  The music is affecting!  The camera work is sublime!  Even the special effects work incredibly well given the budget.  This is a labor of love for all involved and it shows.<br />And the DVD is the same labor of love.  Two commentaries, deleted scenes, trilers, easter eggs!  You could spend days on this disc and never get tired.<br />This is a no brainer!  It's a must-have for anyone who loves movies.
B00000JPH6|5.0|DO watch this movie.  Best effects and storyline.  A good reflection of today.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce shines through as a woman without her group around her, and surprise ... it's a retro-fitted hip hop affair with a lot of sensual laid back grooves.  The first single \\"CRAZY IN LOVE\\" is the most uptempo sampling a 70s groove from \\"Are you my Woman\\".  That is followed by \\"NAUGHTY GIRL\\" which Beyonce uses a hook from \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" by Donna Summer.  We all knew she has a reverence for the 70s, but most surprising are the Middle Eastern influences found in both NAUGHTY GIRL and BABY BOY.  Belly dancers rejoice!  The second half of the album slows down, but never to a ballad speed.  Low funky beats keep the entire album afloat, and rap stars like Jay Z, Missy Elliot, Sean Paul, and Sleepy Brown color almost every other song.  It's ghetto fabulous from the cover photo (diamonds and jeans) to the spoken \\"BEYONCE INTERLUDE\\" where she coos into the mic about love.  Will she tromp Kelly Roland's solo album numbers in sales?  Maybe.  But each member of Destiny's Child has proven they can stand on their own.  And have their own identity musically.  Beyonce has emerged as the sexy 70s cool hip hop girlfriend.  Suddenly you realize Foxy Cleopatra would love this CD!
B000001FN1|5.0|With a disc as good as this I can't believe Doro went solo to write mostly crap.<BR>Triumph & Agony was a pleasant surprise from beginning to end.  Great sound and great vocals.  A true classic must have.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie is just fun.  No, it didn't win any awards, but if you just want to sit and watch a light-hearted film with great laughs, this is it!  My wife starts laughing at the opening credits.  Of course if you have owned a money pit it probably helps.  If the stairs, tub, carpet, and scaffolding scenes don't make you double over and fight for breath - you may be in need of CPR.  After viewing this you will never hear the phrase \\"two weeks\\" again without smiling.  This is a peek into the greatness that would come from Hanks. ENJOY!
B00006J9OT|3.0|This disc is great because it is Diana Krall live, and Diana Krall is great.  However, if you're an artist that wants to record a live disc then my advice is to RECORD THE WHOLE SHOW!!<br />If it takes 2 discs to do it, fine, but do the whole show or nothing at all.  One example from this disc is the song \\"Cry Me A River\\".  The song was on the DVD for the show, but left off of the CD.  :-(
B000068GA4|5.0|The other releases are pale in comparison.  Tired of being alive is a classic and Under her black wings is great.  Good CD beginning to end, you won't be disappointed.
B00009V7RF|4.0|The peas' previous 2 albums were great quality hip hop.  If you've ever seen them live then you know they put on a tremendously good live show. This album definitely sounds like they experimented with all different types of sounds, but it works.  I personally prefer &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; over any of their albums, but that is because I consider it to be one of the best mainstream HIP HOP albums to be released in a while. But this is most deff an album to pick up.  The creativity and originality shines. Definitely quality music.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I was suprised when I watched this.  I usually dont like movies like this, but it was VERY good!  All the actors were great(except Harry Potter-I think he could have acted better).  Would definately watch again and looking forward to the rest!
0688163173|4.0|Readers seem to go immediately to one of the two extremes - they<br />either really LIKE it or really DISLIKE it.  I bought the book<br />because the plot synopsis sounded intriguing to me, and I thoroughly<br />enjoyed it.  The &quot;dark and stormy night&quot;  approach worked for<br />me in this case, and I felt myself drawn to finishing the story and<br />finding out what happened to everyone.  Bits and pieces of the<br />story seemed to push off each other in a strange and weird way<br />until everything came together in the end.
B000002P5W|5.0|Wow! After listening to this cd that's all that could come out of my mouth.Hendrix is just so brilliant, man.The guitar playing is usual Hendrix.The lyrics are also very powwerful.You just don't mess with Jimi.My favorite song on here is Little Wing.It is one of the greatest guitar solos of all time.You don't even have to hear any words to feel the emotion of the song.The guitar is just so powerful.You don't mess with Hendrix!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce has not only the beauty but the talent! I have waited months for this album to be released and it was worth the wait. I am 24 years old and this album shows the mature and sexy side of Beyonce. I have listened to this album about 4 times since Tuesday. She deserves great reviews for this CD. I am glad that we can finally showcase talent. Ashanti is surviving because of her beauty, but to me she has not talent. Beyonce has a wonderful voice and she can dance. I think that she should continue to do her own thing. I love DC, but Beyonce will always shine on her own. My favorite tracks are Crazy in Love, Dangerously in Love, Naughty Girl, Baby Boy (Hot Track with Sean Paul) and Yes. I wish her much success!!! Shut the mouths of all your haters Beyonce. This is the next Tina Turner!!!
B00000IFWE|5.0|People who really liked Tom's old sound probably wont care for this album.But artists can't always keep doing the same thing over and over again.The songs on &quot;Echo&quot; are mellow compared to &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; or &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot;.Tom starts to tackle serious issues and having more love in life.I doubt that any of these songs are played on the radio, but I hate the radio and Tom does too.True fans should buy this album.
0385504209|2.0|Argh.<br />I was very intrigued by this book - at first.  Da Vinci.  Code.  Murder.  Conspiracy.  Mmm, tasty.  Then I read it.<br />Initially, I put up with some of the initial very contrived plot points (some events are just WAY to convenient).  And then I tolerated the characters' overwrought inner monologues ('Wait!  How could he possibly know that?  Yes, that happened to be my grandfather's secret little favorite thing to do that no one ever knew about and now convienently allows me to tell you something I could not possibly have known otherwise that enables this ridiculous plot point to actually work out!').  But I just can't keep going on.  This book reads like a bad TV movie, or worse, like a bad soap opera epsiode where *every* inner thought of each character is revealed as though we were idiots.  Revealing subtle plot points is one thing; beating the reader over the head with a club of patronizingly innane dialog is entirely another.  Not to mention the contrived 'cliffhangers' at the end of each chapter, conveniently developed because a character insists on concealing information for no other reason than to conceal information to develop a cliffhanger for the chapter.<br />The whole thing reads like a really cool idea for a rough draft as told throught the eyes of a high school student.  The book reads as though the author stumbled across some wild research by someone else and decided to make a book that used that research without really knowing what it was all about.  The plot is so stinkin' contrived that I found myself on *numerous* occasions rolling my eyes and shaking my head in disbelief that the author actually expected me to buy what I just read.  It seemed as though the author realized he had boxed himself into a corner after creating a weird twist that he just thought was cool, so instead of reworking the twist into something more plausible, he just manipulated things into a convenient resolution that suddenly made everything 'okay' (like a convenient backstory about a certain logo on a certain key plot piece that justified a certain childhood nickname ).  Please.  Some of the stuff might 'make sense' for the moment and serve to keep things afloat (though gasping for breath) and temporarily block a gaping plot hole with duct tape and a wad of Bubble Yum so the reader doesn't completely lose it and run sreaming for a refund, but they ultimately only serve to pacify the need for something deeper and more substantial, much like drinking sugar water.  Sorry, I'm just not into this kind of thing.  Fun reading is one thing, but I can't do this.  I just can't do it.<br />It's mindless summer reading that requires no thought by the reader to engage it.  The reader is told what to think and where to think it.  In fact, someone could zone out for several chapters and not really miss anything, much like skipping a few weeks of your favorite soap opera.  Even with all the mysterious conspiracy theories that the author attempts to weave into the book, it still reads (literally) like a rough concept draft that would need serious revision before ever going to press.  Sure, as a novel it has all the classic elements (no blaring plot contradictions (they're all conveniently resolved, remember?), multiple parallel story lines, hero vs. villain, good vs. evil, etc., etc.) that at the very least make it competent (thus the 2 stars), but the writing is choppy and juvenile with participial phrases out the wazoo.  You're time could be just as well spent reading the latest issue of Cosmo.  And at least then you'd walk away with potentially applicable information...<br />I must admit I am surprised this book sits atop the bestseller list.  (But then again 'Kangaroo Jack' was the number one movie the first week it was out.)  If you are considering this book, please, please, please be aware of what you are getting yourself into.  It's not a fantastic work of literary insight.  But if you enjoy literature that patronizes you into a corner of disbelief, then by all means, pick up your plastic page marker and dig in!corner of disbelief, then by all means, pick up your plastic page marker and dig in!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved 'Shrek' from the first time I saw it at the theater, and left thinking, 'that soundtrack was great.' I especially liked the track, 'Halleluiah' by Leonard Cohen.<br />Since then, I've made a digital recording (Tivo) of 'Shrek' and watched it 10+ times. (My wife says, 'Are you watching Shrek again? Well, yes I am ...)<br />From the opening minute to the closing credits, this film is a delight - visually, musically, and narratively. There isn't a wasted minute. And that is why I consider it a perfect film. From beginning to end you will be thoroughly entertained.<br />I love Mike Myers' voice as Shrek, and the animation gives him a real heart. Eddie Murphy as Donkey is superb. I guess Eddie might not appreciate this, but Shrek is a high point in his career. His constant prattle is hilarious. I still laugh outloud at his lines, and 10+ times later, I still cry when he meets Dragon at the stream.<br />The pop-culture references - 'Matrix' and 'Disney World' get reamed - still seem very fresh to me. And then Lord Farquaad meets his demise and Donkey exclaims, 'Celebrity marriages. They never last!' It's a very clever script, beautifully animated, beautifully execited.<br />There's a sweet message in Shrek, and it touches the heart.<br />It richly deserved the 2002 Oscar for 'Best Animated Film'. I just wonder, wasn't it the best film of 2002? Yes.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This one of the best CD's I own. No matter what type of Radiohead songs you like, i.e. Paranoid Android or Fake Plastic Trees, this album fill your needs. It is easy to tell that a lot of work went into each song. They continue to be able to constantly change there songs 2 or 3 time right in the middle so by the end off the song you don't what the start of the song was like, but in a good way. If there is one flaw it's some songs have a load, repetitive, electronic, beat that can be annoying. These songs really do not detract from sqwat. If you really hate those songs you can simply hit skip and move on and the album will still kick major ... One rare thing that occors on the this album is that every song is different! You can accually tell were you are on the album by listening to the song. Radiohead puts out everything on \\"Hail to the Theif\\" in a matter that makes you proud to be a fan...
B00009V7T2|5.0|i would have liked to had a more toned-down title for this review, but there is nothing that describes this album more directly than that. of course, you cannot mention the mars volta without mentioning at the drive-in. after at the drive-in broke up and i heard that they were splitting up into two bands, i had a feeling that omar rodriguez (guitar) and cedric bixler (vocals) would be the ones who would feed the creative fire. after a wait of around 2 years, i am pleased to say that my assumption was justified.<br />if you were a fan of cedric's thesaurus-like lyrics and delivery, then you will be at home here with the vocals. however, if lyrics like &quot;exoskeletal junction at the railroad delay&quot; and &quot;trackmarked amoeba lands craft&quot; just don't touch you in that special way, you'll have a lot to get over.<br />de-loused in the comatorium is a concept album. now, your first thoughts may turn to prog rock superstars like yes and rush. well, people may describe this album as having a prog-like feel, but i beg to differ. when the album begins with 'son et lumiere,' those images of laser light shows may come flowing back into your mind..but those images are immediately shattered by the opening riffs of 'inertiatic esp.' razor-sharp riffs and keyboard blasts float all around you in an ocean of paranoid rhythm. this feeling stays with you throughout the coming tracks. 'drunkship of lanterns,' a song released to stream by the band a couple months ago, has a salsa-type feel to it as the guitar and bass quiver and jump in the background. cedric's falsetto crooning dodge in and out of the rhythm section with deft precision throughout the album while omar's patented experimental guitar strumming sound at times like jimmy page and at times like whales and dolphins. the centerpiece of this album is 'cicatriz esp,' a sprawling masterwork featuring soft dub-type production and progressive, jagged riffs. by the time you get to the album's closing number (the jazz-rock number 'take the veil cerpin taxt'), you will have wondered how it is already over. it is a very addictive listen.<br />if you do not totally feel the album after the first listen, give it another couple chances. odds are that you will find something that you like about it..and once you find one thing, the rest of the album will start to fit together. maybe you'll even be able to figure out what cedric means with his william burroughs-esque lyrics...if so, congratulations. you'll probably figure out more about it than me in due time.<br />this album is a sign of wonderful things to come and beautiful things that are already here.
B00009V7T2|5.0|this is just a great album and will bring the heart and sould of ATDI back into everyones listening. the guitar riffs are better, the singing is better, and i believe it is as good if not better then the original ATDI. its a great album that anyone with a good taste of music should have.
B00007KWI9|5.0|One of the impressive things about listening to any of the pre-Yes Album Yes material is discovering the great musicianship<BR>of the band with Tony Kaye and Peter Banks on keyboards and guitar. Throw in Bill Bruford pounding the drums, and damn, this band could jam! Lennon/McCartney material-no problem. Broadway tune-piece of cake. <br />As much as I love their later, more progressive stuff (Yes Album and beyond), Anderson/Squire/Banks/Kaye/Bruford is by far my favorite lineup.<br />Check out their BBC recordings from '69-'70 (&quot;Before and Beyond&quot; or &quot;Millenium&quot;;same music,different CD titles) for some truly inspired rock &amp; roll.
B000099T2L|5.0|There are so many words to describe this album, but the word that sticks in my mind when I play this CD(which is about 10 times a day), is fantastic!!!!! There is not a song on this album that I skip over, I even love the Beyonce'-interlude, which is about 10 seconds long. The first single \\"Crazy in love\\" is only a taste of all the breathe taking tracks. Her music alone is so different from Destiny's Child, she is really giving us a peak inside the real Beyonce'. Every song on this CD could be a single and hit number one on the charts, she could \\"any, mini, myni, mo\\" for a single and you would love it. Trust me if you purchase this CD, you will not be disappointed. There are so many Beyonce' haters I know, but I promise if there are some reading this, the CD will change your opinion of her, if not the CD will have you impressed of her song writing. I love all the tracks, but my favorite is \\"Be with you\\" , which is sampled from (Otis & Bootsy Collins'\\"I'd rather be with you\\"), \\"Yes\\", \\"Signs\\", produced by Missy Elliot, \\"Naughty Girl\\", which has a sample of Donna Summer's \\"Love to love you baby\\", \\"Baby boy\\"*** feat. Sean Paul, and of coarse the all times favorite by millions \\"Dangerously in love\\". And who is not crazy in love with \\"Crazy in love\\". I hope I changed your opinions about her. Beyonce' I love you girl, even though some don't. It's not everyday that we hear people in the industry that can really  sing, without help from all the high-tech studio equipment. Tavarius \\"Ta-V\\"
B00007KWHP|5.0|Combining a killer combination of rock and progressive styles, this is probably the best Yes has put out. Roundabout is simply the prototypical progressive tune - great melodies, lots of tempo changes, and, yes, great, semi-understandable lyrics. <br />However, South Side of the Sky and Heart of the Sunrise are are really the songs that push this CD into the classic category.<BR>The individual pieces are all very good (and guaranteed each member of the band some royalties, always a crowd pleaser!).<br />A great CD to start out a Yes collection.
B000005L86|5.0|This album is truly one of the most beautiful things - and that includes everything, ever - that I've come across. It's like a gift given to me by the supreme being, because this is an album of praise. Let it get inside you and expand and you will be filled with mystery and joy. I cannot overstate the effect this album has on me, particularly tracks 1, 3 and 9. These may be the best songs I have ever heard, in any genre. Get this, spread it around, live with it. Lee Perry insanity combined with heart-stoppingly beautiful vocals. A must-own, to say the least.

0156027321|2.0|This book just wasn't very interesting once Pi's boat went down.  I didn't feel like reading half a book about this situation.  I like books with strong character development, and I this this book is lacking just that.
0609610570|2.0|I stopped reading this about half way through.  If you have any common sense and reasonable people skills, you don't need to read this to be able to &quot;get things done.&quot;
B000084T18|3.0|hmmmm....<BR>50 cent couldnt possibly have lived up to the hype there was on this album, but he does (with the help of eminem and dre) a pretty good job of trying...<BR>people are being way too hard on him, while the cd is actually respectable. being only 15 i never listened to de la soul or tribe, but no self-respecting rap fan can have not listened to tupac, biggie, rakim, snoop, etc. although im definitely a huge fan of 50s, calling him the next pac or even comparing him is ridiculous...<br />good album, worth the buy, but dont believe the hype...hes not tupac...

0385508417|5.0|This would be a perfect story for a movie.  And it would probably become a holiday tradition in some families.  The story is about a couple who decide to skip Christmas because their only child has gone to Peru for two years.  They decide to take a cruise instead and enjoy the money they spend for a change.  People in their town, and especially on their street just don't get it.  And it only gets worse when their daughter suddenly shows up on Christmas Eve, new fiance in tow, wanting to show him all the great things her family does at Christmas.  It's a scream in places and in others, you begin to understand that, commercial as Christmas has become in our world, it's just as hard work (and a lot less fun)to NOT have it.  You'll love it!
B000002INJ|5.0|My allies and I will only listen to true metal when preparing for battle.  Although my foes are myriad, they cannot crush my spirit.  And this album has substantially contributed to that spirit.  I've got the biggest amps, and man they blast.  I cannot understand why a person would by an album by any other band.  Other bands play, Manowar kills.
B00009V7T2|2.0|These guys have so so so much potential and it is apparent from this release, as well as their work with ATDI, but they fall drastically short here.  I am utterly bored by this album, too many Led Zep referances, too much wanting to be the new Tool and not enough of the visceral thrill that made ATDI what they were.  Led Zep were great, but it seems that everyone who tries to referance them fails badly (White Stripes anyone?), here it is the prog side of Zep that shows its face and it plays no better than the Stripes rip-off of the blues side of Zep.  Then there is the prog-like Tool sci-fi bit going on...That could work, but not when coupled with the Page/Bonham retreds...and even if it did work, it still wouldn't be Tool.  Mars Volta had something wonderfully their own in the sound of ATDI...it was punk prog, and if they would have expanded it more this would have been a winner, but instead we are left with other people's old ideas recycled.  When they try here for just prog while referencing so many others, it just falls flat (plus could we get one American prog band to try someone like Faust or Can for inspiration, rather than the already noted tired Zep influence?).  Better luck next time guys, and I hope there is a next time, because there is a lot of potential here...but strike this one out.
0451169514|2.0|While browsing in a local bookstore, I ran across a book on Stephen King in which the author ranked his all-time favorite King books.  \\"It\\" was ranked #1, and \\"The Stand\\" was ranked # 2.  Since I had read and enjoyed \\"The Stand\\" but had never read \\"It\\", I decided to pick it up and give it a try.<br />I rather enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book.  By gradually revealing more and more through the device of switching between events in the present and those in a particular Summer many years ago, King is able to build suspense and keep the reader intrigued.  \\"What is 'It'?\\" we wonder.<br />Unfortunately, the gradual discovery of what \\"It\\" is is the most disappointing part of the book.  When the identity of \\"It\\" finally becomes clear, my response was \\"You've got to be kidding.\\"  It suddenly switches from horror to absurdity.  I realize that in stories of this kind some \\"suspension of disbelief\\" is necessary, but but there is only so far a reader can go within the internal logic of a story.  The events that occur in the final chapters of the book as the main characters battle \\"It\\" are some of the dumbest words I've ever read.  The words of the Principal in the movie \\"Billy Madison\\" would be an appropriate response to the author of this novel: \\"What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\\"<br />[As an added note, there is one \\"scene\\" near the end of the book (a \\"sex scene\\") which is, considering the ages of those involved, completely inappropriate in any context].
B00005JLK1|1.0|This movie is terribly, terribly bad. Ghost Ship makes other lousy scary movies like Event Horizon, Jason X, or Critters 4 seem like sophisticated classics of the horror genre. The film is mostly dull predictable and needlessly gory (and I'm not one who is against gore, but gore can't make up for the mindless plot). Many of the horror elements used in this film are extremely cliche, and the ones that seem very original aren't developed well enough to really have much of an effect. The stars are somewhat famous, but it seems the film makers probably wasted their money because they could have gotten the same quality of acting from no names. The mood of the film jumps all over the place and has a questionable soundtrack. Though the film sounds promising, it's a waste of time . Even if all you want is a suspensful film, don't expect it from this movie either. It saddens me that there are viewers who can give this film more than 2 stars. But, if you are someone who likes a well developed and suspensful horror film, and who doesn't just like a lousy gore driven film (and by the way there are plenty of gore driven films that are better than this one) look elsewhere.
B00008J4P5|4.0|They rock live! Planned or not, Jack's tight white pants were transparent by the end of the night...god bless texas heat. They pulled off back to back shows with just a few hours in between to rest, shower and and give it their everything all over again. Well done! There was no holding back. Meg was wonderful and even though Jack referred to her as his &quot;sister&quot;, I know those two have something else going on..... crowd pleasers were Ball and Biscuit, I Fought Piranhas and and There's No Home For You Here. The first attempt at Seven Nation Army bombed , and they gave up claiming the guitar was out of tune....SUUUUURE. It was just plain awful. They tried it again and did it justice during their encore but could have easily left it out entirely and everyone would have still walked away totally satisfied!
B00008H2LE|4.0|After the release of Reanimation Linkin Park fans eagerly awaited the release of some new songs from their favourite band.True to its name , the album is awe inspiring, very like the ancient place from where it derives its name.    Linkin Park have produced an amzing collaberation of rock tunes with amazing rap vocals by Mike Shinoda,who's calm, confident voice compliments Chester Bennigtons heartfelt 'screaming' very well.Add great music and you've got the Linkin Parks signature style.The only ingredient this album lacks, is the fresh new sound of Hybrid theory that made it stand out among all the other rock bands.This album is distinctively Linkin Parks,but if you are not a hard core fan of this genre,you may find the songs similar and even monotonous.  However they are amazing songs on this album.Here are the songs in the order that they appear on the C.D    1.Foreward:This is just the sound of someone using a hammer to pick at something,when suddenly glass shatters breaking into the next track.    2.Don't stay:This songs music is really loud.So turn up the volume and enjoy the amazing lyrics as Chester says \\"Dont stay.Forget our memories.Forget our possibilities.\\"  This song is amazing to listen to,especially for those who have experienced some kind of betrayal or pain.It really makes you relate.    3.Somewhere I Belong: This song is without a doubt breathtaking,the music is really tense and the lyrics are sung in such an angry,resenting yet regretful tone of voice by both vocalists,you can feel their memories pouring out of the songs.  As Chester says\\"I wanna find something I've wanted for so long\\"    4.Lying from You: This song is probably my least favourite in the album and it seems to sound a little similar to the second track.However the music is a little slower .  \\"I'm trying to bend the truth\\" .Sorry Chester.This didn't cut it for me.    5.Hit the Floor:This song is out of this world and the music is simplistic which somehow makes it even more appealing and catchy.You can here the amazing medley of soft sounds over their hard core rock sound.This song is one that you cannot forget because its about how you think \\"you've won and then its all gone\\"    6.Easier to Run:This song is slightly similar to Crawling and the vibe is fairly slow,however Mikes rapping is just amazing in this song and Chester seems to belt out his vocals as if he is in a lot of pain.The lyrics,like all LP songs ,are just fantastic . \\"If I could change I would.Take The blame I would.If I could trace every wrong move that I made I would\\"  If those words sound familiar,you'll love the song.    7.Faint:This is a fast paced song,belted out in a hoarse voice which gives the song a good vibe,but there's nothing incredible about it in comparison to the other songs on the album.      8.Figure.09:This song is similar to lying from you and is a nice track if you havent heard track 4.    9.Breaking the Habit:This song is about a guy who is trying to \\"Break the Habit\\" and its very inspiring.The tempo is just right, edgy yet slow with no screaming or rapping and we can hear the softer side of Chesters amazing voice.    10.From the Inside: This song was performed very well by chester especially since he was sick.Its an anger-expressed song that has meaningful lyrics and good music to go with it.    11.Nobody's listening:This is just Fabulous and it is without a doubt the best song in the album.The Japenese flute    12.Session- Session has a very electronic and techno beat to it.Its is an essential in the Matrix Reloaded Soundtrack, and really goes with the theme of the movie.    13.Numb:An excellent end to an excellent album.
B000006NPY|5.0|On the Smashing Pumpkins follow to the 2-disc epic \\" Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness \\". They take a deep plunge into their sound and come out with nothing but beauty. Screeching guitars are traded for syntheisizers while massive drum beats switch too piano keys. I was impressed highly but no like I was with the predecessors. Adore is faboulous don't get me wrong but not as hard rocking or as amusing as Mellon Collie or Siamese Dream. The band abandon their roots but still come out with something astonishing. So thats why you should buy it!!!!!!
B00000JPH6|4.0|The Dark Crystal is quite possibly one of the strangest movies to ever come out of the Jim Henson Creature Shop. That being said, it is probably also one of the best. This movie portrays the classic struggle of good versus evil with the side of good facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles. While I enjoyed this film as a child (although some parts were a bit scary) I find myself enjoying it even more as an [young] adult. What originally appeared to be a struggle between good and evil now shows itself that all people have both good and evil inside of them, and the two work in a natural harmony. In a day of pure digital characters, it is exciting to see Muppets in action. As far as digital technology has come, it still lacks the realism these characters portray. I highly recommend this film.
0385484518|5.0|38 year old male. I read this as part of a class I was taking. Truly wonderful! I'm buying a copy for my parents. I'd like them to be inspired, as I was, now as they map out how they will live the rest of their lives. They aren't dying, but then again neither was Morrie; Morrie was living. My grandmother just spent the last eight years dying. I can't help but to feel that had she read this book she would have spent her last 8 years living.<br />Everyone needs to read this book. Life is one of those things that you had better get all you can out of. Living for the moment, every day, in every way. This book is truth.
630542845X|5.0|Powder is a movie with a moral. The moral, so artfully told, is to respect those who are different from you. Though Powder is different for his seemingly \\"magical\\" powers, he can be seen as a metaphor for many different groups that have been harassed for being different (racial and ethnic minorities, sexual orientation, people with diseases, even \\"nerds\\"). This movie even manages to accomplish this without being heavy handed. A highly enjoyable and emotional film with great performances by the stars.

6305308659|5.0|Pleasantville is quite probably one of the greatest films of all time. Each cast member in the film delivers a stellar performance from William H. Macy to Tobey Maguire to Paul Walker and even to Don Knotts. This film shows the importance of education, critical thought, and expressing oneself. It is a message that continually finds new meanings in the American experience, whether it be in the Salem Witch Hunts, the McCarthy Communist Hunts, or even current infringements on civil liberties and deciding who is and isn't a &quot;patriot.&quot; This film manages to show how important being an individual is. It shows how much one person can make a difference. It is, once again, one of the best films of all time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I never expected to enjoy this movie as much as I did!  I saw it in the theater with my friend and we were both impressed.  Renee and Catherine are amazing and the whole cast is impressive.  I bought the sound track as soon as possible and I can't wait until August 19th to buy the DVD!
B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Though? managed to revive a style of music many American had never heard before. It's soundtrack has found its way into many homes that it might never have gone before. The fantastic soundtrack manages to compliment a great film though. Knowing the Odyssey on which this story was based helps add some fun to the movie, however, it isn't necessary. I've found that whereas I know the story of the Odyssey and am able to identify certain characters and similarities, my parents had no such knowledge and I doubt their enjoyment of the film was any less than mine. George Clooney does one of his better film performances in this movie (second to Ocean's 11 perhaps) but it is the plethora of supporting characters and cast that help make this ancient story come to life. If for the sound track alone this movie deserves a recommendation, but I believe that even without its amazing soundtrack, it would be a phenomenal success.
B000002UKS|5.0|I have been a huge foo fan for a long time, so this review will probably seem a bit biased, but I don't care.<BR>Of all the albums the Foo Fighters have put out, I think that this one is the best. Though all their albums are 100% amazing, I believe that this one best showcases not only their musical talents, but Dave's songwriting talents. Every song is heartfelt and meaningful. It's a perfect mix of the loud, hard rock sound we're all used to from these guys, and soft, sends-shivers-down-your-spine ballads. <BR>The album starts out with one of those very pretty soft songs, Doll, and then catches you off guard by launching into the radio favorite, Monkey Wrench. One of the many great songs to rock out to on this album. But now on to the other songs:<BR>Hey, Johnny Park!- a sort of mix between the lyrical softness of the slow songs and the hard rock sound of the fast songs. It's one of those songs you would listen to if you were feeling depressed and wanted to listen to something that was a sad kind of slow, but still rocked when it got to the chorus, so you could be both sad and angry in the same song. Chilling.<BR>My Poor Brain- starts out with various guitar sounds and then goes in to a catchy, soft little tune, in which the high end Dave's incredible range can be heard. Then it goes into a loud chorus, back into the soft verse, and finally into an exploding ending. Dave uses that raspy yelling voice basically through the end of the song. <BR>Wind Up- the prime example of the hard core foo sound we're accustomed to. loud guitar, thumping bass, pounding drums and perhaps a bit of anger in the lyrics? A great song to rock out to when you're mad. <BR>Up In Arms- another soft, sweet song. It starts out nice and slow; very pretty. Dave's calm voice, quiet drums, quiet guitar, quiet bass. Then there's a small break, and they launch into a louder version of the same verse. It rocks. <BR>My Hero- The first words that come to my mind are lyrically chilling. It's impossibleto hear this song and not think of Kurt Cobain. At least it is for me. It begins with a drum solo, and then the bass joins in, and then the guitars. It's a beautiful song. Probably my favorite on the whole CD. Perhaps it's just the Nirvana fan in me sympathizing, but it really is an amazing tribute. <BR>See You- I find this song very entertaining. For some reason, the tune and the upbeat tempo are amusing to me. It reminds me of For All The Cows. And that's a funny song.  <BR>Enough Space- I get a kick out of this song! Almost the whole song, Dave is screaming about not having enough space,which is countered by a soft and sweet verse. That method seems to be a trend on this album. This song is almost one of those that you would expect to be the background music for a jackass commercial. <BR>February Stars- another major favorite of mine. It is a heartfelt ballad that finds me near tears by the end. Incredible. <BR>Everlong- Postersong of the Foos. Everybody loves this song, and with good reason. Many people say this is the best Foo Fighters song ever written, and I would say they're probably right. <BR>Walking After You- classic love ballad complete with slow, tear-jerking tune and beautiful lyric from someone who has definately been around the block with love once or twice. <BR>New Way Home- Awesome way to end the album. It has a catchy tune and beat that make you want to jump around and be crazy. <BR>The words amazing, incredible and awesome just keep coming to my mind as I'm writing this, because the Foos deserve only the strongest adjectives meaning very good when their music and talents are talked about. <BR>If you do not have this album already, you MUST buy it, because it is the Foo Fighters at their best, and you are so deprived if you don't already have it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Though? managed to revive a style of music many American had never heard before. Its soundtrack has found its way into many homes that it might never have gone before. The fantastic sountrack mangages to compliment a great film though. Knowing the Oddessy on which this story was based helps add some fun to the movie, however, it isn't neccessary. I've found that whereas I know the story of the Oddessy and am able to identify certain characters and similarities, my parents had no such knowledge and I doubt their enjoyment of the film was any less than mine. George Clooney does one of his better film performances in this movie (second to Ocean's 11 perhaps) but it is the plethora of supporting characters and cast that help make this ancient story come to life. If for the sound track alone this movie deserves a reccommendation, but I believe that even without its amazing soundtrack, it would be a phenomenal success.
B00009V7T2|4.0|The problem with most albums that beg to be taken seriously, is that they don't measure up. Not the case for De-Loused in the Comatorium.  If you own the Sparta album make sure not to place it on the same shelf as this, this blows it away.  Given the concept of this album, and the simultaneous destruction of musical equipment that appears to be going on at the studio, listen with headphones, the concept and the decision to produce this way, comes across clearly.<br />I have one problem with this album and thats that the only time I'll listen to it with another person I'll be driving late at night on an interstate.  Not very often, I don't have a car.  Theres just too much to pay attention to and with headphones on it makes me feel like my hippy-Uncle Paul, must've felt when he heard Floyd for the first time. <br />I think this is a band worth being excited for.  See the live show if you have a chance.  Long time fans of the Rodriguez-Bixler duo are sitting with pillows on their laps waiting for their tickets in the mail.  So if it's sold out pay off the door guy or sneak in the back.   If you don't own Tremulant EP, buy it with this and you'll be happy to save the 2 bucks now.
B00005YW4H|5.0|While I bought this CD only knowing &quot;Come away with me&quot; and &quot;Don't know why&quot; I wasn't disappointed with the rest. Norah Jones has a fantastic voice and a musical style I've never quite heard before. Her songs can only be described as beautiful.

B00006LI4S|2.0|It's sad to see what once was the best band on earth divided, quarreled and releasing low quality material like this DVD. Roger Waters did basically the same, but since he had a much better team behind him the result was acceptable. Gilmour did it really worse. <BR>First of all, it's a mistery why he left his guitar off. Gilmour is not that good playing an acoustic guitar, and Floyd songs get boring and slow without his astunning effects and bends. Shine on You Crazy Diamonds sounds like an everlasting-boring-acoustic-guitar-solo, which I'd never expect from Gilmour. <BR>Secondly, he changed the songs horribly. Comfortably Numb sung by some old man who reads the lyrics written in a piece of paper (could someone please explain me what was that?) gets awful, and the acoustic guitar makes it sound even worse. Fat Old Sun is acceptable, as well as Wish You Were Here. High Hopes reached a quality similar to the original, but again Coming Back to Live sounds odd. <BR>Overall, this is a very dissapointing DVD. I purchased it expecting to see Gilmour at its best, and that's not what I found. Look for Pulse VHS if you want to listen to his majesty.
1563898586|5.0|I won't bore you with a summary of the comic because there are so many already up here, but i just wanted to say this is just a good old fashioned ... comic. It's really fun stuff, alan moore never looked better. The charcters are intersting and a lot of amusing mentions to the backgrounds of the literay inspired charcters. It might be confusing for those who don't really know literay figures, but don't worry the art and makes up for it. Actuallly i'm really annoyed with the way they're doing this in the movie that's going to be coming out. Read the the comic before you see the movie, so you can join me in being [mad]. Psh.. adding Tom sawyer and dorien grey..Thats! that's?!!! WTH man??? You know they changed the name of the invisible man from griffin to skinner??!! Also what's this with making sean connary the leader of the group where it's presumed that miss murray is the leader in the comic??!! grrr..
B00005U122|3.0|You know, it's always hard to listen (or to watch) anything former Pink Floyd members have done after the band split up, back in 1981. Recently, Gilmour released David Gilmour in concert, which is a rather boring acoustic set of old Floyd Songs. A little earlier, Water had released this In The Flesh. <BR>First of all, it is necessary to be said that Waters's choosen a reasonably good set list. It includes all Floyd phases, completed with his solo career material. Heart-breaking classics such as Dogs, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, Time, Comfortably Numb, Wish you Were Here, SOYCD are all there, highly loyal to the originals versions. So, what am I complaining about... ? All Floyd classisc, an all-star line up performing them, a big crowd and high-quality image and sound. What's missing... ? Oh, come, you all know the answer. IT'S NOT PINK FLOYD. David, Nick and Rick are missing. The astonishing magic surrounding the band, which is at its best in Live At Pompeii, is not there. Great guitar players perform David' solos, but it's not David. The biggest problem with In The Flesh is maybe its best quality: it's a great collection of live songs. And that's just it.<BR>Pink Floyd used to do magic live. Without his former band mates, Waters can do only music.
B00000DCHI|5.0|The first time I ever heard a greatest hits album was when I first heard Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volume I and II.  I first got this album on tape, but the CD has more.  There are four more songs included on the CD, Captain Jack, The Entertainer, Scenes From An Italian Restaurant and She's Got A Way.  <br />This whole double disk greatest hits album is wonderful.  Billy Joel knows how to write a song that tells a distinct and very interesting story, and he does it again and again on this album.  My all time favorites are Piano Man, The Stranger, It's Still Rock And Roll To Me and Don't Ask Me Why.
B000096I9G|3.0|I HAVE to begin by saying that I REALLY REALLY MISS BORIS WILLIAMS DRUMMING!!! Jason's drums sound like cardboxes. I think everyone will agree with this. <BR>Also Roger doesn't play the Disintegration set with the original or close-to-the-original sounds! Listen to Disintegration, Closedown or even better Lullaby! the keyboards doesn't sound right. The great Homesick is screwed by both, Jason and Roger.
B00008YLV2|5.0|This is an exceptional peice of film making if you can \\"cowboy\\" (or cowgirl) up enough to watch the gruesome war scenes.  Hoo-aah? Maybe if you do not approve of the gore, you might think twice in the future for setting up a kid glove approach to politically correct wars where we can never use full force to protect our men and women in the field.  Major General Harrison did indeed request heavy armor and full size gunships and was denied by the U.N. desk warriors.  We also had to be politically correct enough to treat Mr. Atto to tea (at the start of the movie) when he was the one that sold all of the RPG's (surface to air hand held missile launchers) to the Mog militia to enable them to shoot down helicopters. What was basically wrong with the military Plan A was that there was no backup Plan B.   My prescription for what ails this entire politically correct approach to war invented by desk warriors is a bit rougher, but would get our troops home alive.  First, fit Mr. Atto with a stinger suppository.  Lets have some fireworks.  Second, ditto that for desk warriors.  Third, put full size gunships and tanks into the battle.  If you run into an angry mob bearing down on a downed helicopter and its crew, roast and toast the entire street.  Can't get to the crash site because of a barricade?  A couple of tank rounds ought to widen the street quite well.  Anything left in the way can be crushed down to recycled beer can thinness.  The tragedy of this entire situation is that we are still living with the results of Europeans creating artificial national boundaries that put tribes together that have been fighting for hundreds of years.  My full one thousand percent support is behind feeding starving babies anywhere in the world.  However, this also means my full support is behind dealing with any slob war lord that would practice genocide.  You can't do this in half measures.  Once you have our troops in the field risking their lives, they need our full support to come home alive.  As Hoot, the Delta Force veteran in the movie would say, once the bullets start flying by your head, politics don't mean nothing.  There's only the guys next to you.  You have their backs and they have yours.  Once they are in the field risking their lives, WE have their backs.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes reads like a novel. Yes, it really is all of those wonderful things that you've heard about it, but mostly it's entertaining and engaging.  McCourt makes the sad and heartbreaking aspects palatable by tempering his narration with warmth and humor, but without diluting any of the harshness. Yes, you must read this book.
B000009M5E|5.0|This has got to be my favorite opera next to Bizet's Carmen. The sound is perfect and the CD comes with a nce little booklet that tells you alot about whats going on during each song. If you love opera you really should buy this! Puccini's music is excellent and the cast is very spectacular! A must have!
0316666343|4.0|This novel started out rather sad and troubling, but as I continued on, I became comfortable with the premise. There's something calming about the culmination of the journey we take with the tragic young narrator. It's haunting and beautifully written, both heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time. Yes, it's supernatural and somewhat sensational. Yes, I can see how some readers may find aspects of it to be a bit over-the-top. But the author never loses control of the weaving storyline, remaining ultimately convincing the whole way. Overall, I'm very glad I read it.
B000005IU2|3.0|Seriously, the first side of this album is totally classic. It's tight, has great riffs and rhythm, and is what keeps this album from receiving 1 star. \\"Dirt\\" takes a little too long, but the beginning of \\"1970\\" makes up for it, which almost becomes the best track UNTIL.......out of nowhere this awful saxophone swoops into the right speaker. I figure that it will be made up for in the next track \\"Fun House\\" and the beginning bass line and Iggy's grunt are reassuring, and then that terrible saxophone comes in again. I'm not against using different instruments, but this guy just won't shut up and let the band play. Finally the last track \\"L.A. Blues\\" which is the big sonic freakout comes on, and I'm looking forward to some white noise to get that cheesy sax out of my head, and the saxophone comes on AGAIN. This guy obviously thinks a lot of himself. It just sounds awkward to have the Stooges tearing it up and this guy is playing jazz freestyle.<br />This album is still five stars.......if you unplug the right speaker.
0140135154|5.0|Barely showing its age after thirty years, John Berger's WAYS OF SEEING remains one of the best popular presentations of academic and scholarly thought in recent decades.  There are actually very few original ideas in Berger's book.  Just about the entire content can be found in a variety of thinkers either inspiring, belonging to, or influenced by the Frankfort school, for instance, Meyer Schapiro, Adorno, and especially Walter Benjamin.  None of these thinkers are household names in the English speaking world, even though Schapiro may well be the greatest art critic America has produced, and despite Benjamin's possibly being the greatest cultural critic of the 20th century.  One reason their ideas have not become more widely known is the fact that all of these thinkers were deeply influenced by Marxism, though none of them were Communists.  As a result, while many of the ideas that Berger presents in his work are well known in literary and scholarly circles, they remain unknown to most casual visitors to art museums.<br />Berger is intent to challenge ways of looking at art and other images that ignore the status of works of art as commodities.  We not only live in a capitalistic society, but one in which virtually all its inhabitants are consumers.  Consumers purchase commodities.  Berger wants to raise the consciousness of viewers of these paintings that they are not merely \\"masterpieces,\\" but commodities.  Or, in the case of oil painting, visual representations of commodities.<br />These central assumptions are brought out in a series of essays.  The first is a straightforward presentation of the main ideas in Walter Benjamin's seminal essay \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\\" a fact that Berger acknowledges at the end of the essay.  (This essay can be easily obtained in Benjamin's great collection ILLUMINATIONS, which also includes classic essays on Proust, Kafka, and Baudelaire, as well as his astonishing \\"Theses on the Philosophy of History.\\")  He goes on to write about such subjects as the significance of nudity (as opposed to nakedness) in painting and the ideological use to which oil painting has been put.  He ends with a marvelous discussion of the real point in advertising (which inevitably arose with the shift of all European and American nations to consumer societies).<br />The great virtue of this book is that Berger has a positive genius for what many of the most pertinent insights of the Frankfort school has been, and a genuine knack for presenting these ideas in a readily graspable form.  The book still reads marvelously after several decades.  I do think the book would benefit from a second edition with a complete revamping of the photographs.  While the content of the book holds up well, the photographs often smack too much of the sixties, making the book feel more like a fragment from the past than it ought.  Still, WAYS OF SEEING remains one of the finest popularizations of the past few decades, though I would hasten to add that any academic would also enjoy reading it.story.\\")  He goes on to write about such subjects as the significance of nudity (as opposed to nakedness) in painting and the ideological use to which oil painting has been put.

B0000683DH|3.0|After being blown away by the sheer size and scope of Star Trek:The Motion Picture (yeah I loved it), this film was a step downward in quality.  Yes this film &quot;moves along&quot; faster than Star Trek I. Yes, it has more action sequences than Star Trek I. What it did not have is the sense of wonder that came with the fascinating story in Star Trek I. Add to that the incredibly cheesy acting (especially Ricardo Montalban's performance who has mastered the art of the big sigh as an acting tool.  Yawn) and you have a decent film, but not a great film.<br />Ok, so I am in the minority here probably with this opinion, but hey I'm used to that.<br />My recommendation is to watch this film and see for yourself. I feel that Star Trek IV is better than this one (very light hearted, more on the human side) Star Trek I is still king in my book.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix has its ups and downs. Up: &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot;, which is a sort of prelude to The Matrix Reloaded and features excellent animation from the same people that made Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within; and &quot;Second Renaissance Parts I &amp; II&quot;, which chronicles how the whole dispute between man and machine began and is truly an awesome experience. Down: While a couple of the other 6 episodes are also good, none of them really stands out as being exceptional, and a couple of them just confused me. Up: There is over an hour of extra features. Down: Most of the people who created The Animatrix speak Japanese, so you have to read sub-titles most of the time. Overall, I highly recommend The Animatrix if you love The Matrix and are up for some deep thinking. Otherwise, I would advise you to stay away.
B000063DIH|5.0|Quite possibly the best Iron Maiden album.  I decieded to look into Iron Maiden solely because I'd heard Wheatus' &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; one the radio one too many times.  I picked up this album and was quite impressed!  While I have bought other Maiden CDs and will buy more Maiden stuff in the future, this is still my favorite.<br />The title track of &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; is simply awesome, one of their best songs ever.  &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot; is very good as well.  My other favorites are &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, &quot;Chains of Misery&quot;, and &quot;Weekend Warrior&quot;.  The whole album is good, albeit lacking quite as much literary references of most past Maiden albums.  The only think I don't like is one song (&quot;Wasting Love&quot;, I think...) where the first half of the song is really good but then the second half is the first half repeated really slowly.  Otherwise, it's an excellent buy.  If you want great Maiden, the beast starts here!
0385509456|5.0|Christopher, the 15-year-old autistic hero of Mark Haddon's first novel, presents a fresh, touching, and funny take on everyday life. He has no guile, no pretence. He tries to remember the coping skills taught in his special school, but they are just like mathematical formulas to him as he follows the designated steps on how to behave in a specific situation. Actually, mathematical formulas make a lot more sense to him, but for the sake of others he is willing to try.<br />Haddon's prose is simple with a different rhythm-Christopher is obviously just a little bit off everyone else's beat-and you are immediately enveloped in this boy's world. It is like seeing the world through the eyes of a spaceman who has studied earthlings assiduously for millennia and is trying to put his bookwork into practical application on his first visit to Earth.  <br />The mystery of the \\"Curious Incident\\" has less to do with the dog in the nighttime than it does with the mysterious workings of the human heart. This moving book is not to be missed.
B000099T2L|5.0|After already carving her status as one of the hottest female entertainers out today, Beyonce Knowles released her highly anticpated c.d. \\"Dangerously In Love\\". From Beginning to End, this album shows the growth of a young woman's writing capabilties. Beyonce has gone from \\"My Body's too Bootylicious\\" with her group Destiny's Child, to writing meaningful R&B songs such as the track, \\"Dangerously In Love\\" and the touching tribute to her father, \\"Daddy\\", a bouns track on the c.d. The banging first single \\"Crazy In Love\\", is probably a strong consideration for the \\"Song of the Summer 2003\\". The strong horn section, the catchy hook of, \\"Uh oh, Uh Oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no..no..\\" and the hard beats backed by beyonce and Jay Z create a song that NO ONE can get out of their heads. Highlights include the seductive \\"Naughty Girl\\", in which Beyonce moans, \\"I love to love you baby\\" just like Donna Summer did in the 70's. Other standout tracks include \\"Signs\\", in which beyonce gets a little help from Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliot, and the irresistible beats of \\"Baby Boy\\". Anyone who expects this c.d to be just some cheesy album full of one liners about love and sex are completely mistaken. This fantasic album is enjoyable to listen to with its hot sounds and beautiful melodies but it also shows how truly talented Beyonce is, as a writer, producer and all around performer. If you don't already have it...buy beyonce's solo debut \\"Dangerously In Love\\" TODAY!!
B000002LTU|2.0|this album is an absolute joke... HOW COULD THEY GET THE BEST JAZZ MUSICIAN IN THE WORLD TO DO HIPHOP? Rappers? RAPPERS????? Easy Moe Bee?? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS! I'm only giving it two stars becuase of miles's master trumpet solos. becuase this was poor miles last album... hope he won't be remembered for it. EVER HEARD OF KIND OF BLUE??? THE BEST JAZZ ALBUM IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC?? Apparently not...
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce has set out to make a classic album....almost.  &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; is a good album it starts with the <BR>-Crazy In Love<BR>-Naughy Girl-is instantly gratifying, so infectous-it blends    Indian rhythms with Donnas Summers Lovetolovyoubaby<BR>Baby Boy-more Indian rhythms and a Sean Paul(it-boy)<BR>This album is mostly comprised of ballads-someonesinlove-<BR>-Speechless-shows uncharted territory in this very sensual song<BR>-yes- is very DC<BR>-Signs- about astrology-welcomes missy<BR>-Gift from virgo- another ballad like most of the album it shows her vocal abiliy which is not over done like most R&amp;b divas today<BR>Those tracks noted above are standout tracks, overall it's good album enjoy
B000099T2L|4.0|If the record industry want to know why sales are dropping, no further evidence is needed than this album.<br />For weeks or months now, radio stations have been playing Beyonce's version of the 50 Cent track In Da Club. Yet out comes her album, and no sign of the track.<br />The UK version of this album is more generous. It includes Work It Out, her track from the Austin Powers in Goldmember movie, and her '03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde track with Jay-Z.<br />You just know that in 3 months they'll try to sell us the same album again with these three additional tracks.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book for my high school book club, and I fell in love with it. This book made me laugh and cry. I think I have re-read it three or four times in the past couple of years and it has always been just as good as the first time. It is sort of a more modern \\"coming of age\\" novel just like \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000099T2L|2.0|I wasnt really wasnt feeling this one. Theres only like 3 good songs on here. Crazy in love is the best one. Second one is thats how u like it with JayZ and yes.  Shes trying too hard to sound sexy it ruins the songs.Personally i like Kelly Rowlands CD better.Overall they have better albulms when they are a group.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I first received my copy of Deloused, I was skeptical due to the enormous amount of hype following ATDI and Sparda. But now I would easily say that the material by The Mars Volta is so much stronger than anything put out by either band collectively. It's hard to not want to listen to the album all the way through each time you put it in. I have turned on many of my friends (some ATDI fans, some totally new fans) and have heard the same response. I was disappointed when they were replaced on the RHCP tour here, so I hope they come back home to Texas and give their growing fan base here a chance to see them live.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I could never really get into At the Drive-In or even the Tremulant EP by these guys but I really have to say that this album just blew my mind. I honestly thought I was not going to like this either. 2 days later it still blows my mind! There's so many layers of creativity here and its cohesiveness as a full album unit? Amazing. you can listen to this several times and still not get to the core of it. All of the instruments work together with such skill. It's progressive without boring you to tears. The latin jazz fusion influences are my favorite part of this album. You hear rush and santana and zeppelin in there but it's perfectly concealed under the personality of the band itself. This is definately not for everybody though. Some people will turn their nose up at this for just being strange and thats totally appropriate, this is a very unusual album and very untraditional but I think it is still somewhat accessible and not quite so pretentious as other progressive productions. Rick Rubin usually scares the heck out of me. He's just involved in everything by everybody else and has made some things I found to be rather dissapointing recently. I could only imagine him as some kind of monkey behind the scenes turning magic gears. I would be scared to make an album with the guy. However, I think in the end he was that extra 2% that really made this great. It's really the only ingredient that I think is missing from Tremulant EP. For some reason this just seems so much more impressive and accessible and so much more mature too. Cedric seems to have come along the most with his vocals. They are so much more pleasing to listen to. I could go into more detail but please just give it a listen. I think Rolling Stone magazine has a live stream of the full album. Listen and if you like it please support this and buy it. Ironically enough this album cost me about the same at the Tremulant EP with it's 3 songs. I guess I finally got my money's worth out of the investment.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Check some of the 1 star reviews for this DVD. It's not because it is bad, but because these people bought the wrong DVD.<br />People please pay attention... The Official 'Queen Live at Wembley DVD' includes 2 Discs and shows Freddie on the cover kind of kneeling on one foot. <BR>The Brazilian bootleg has only one disc, it doesn't include the complete show and it has very poor audio and video quality. It's a pirate version and it shouldn't be sold in stores. Please be careful when you buy it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When i bought this cd i had high expectations but i never thought it would be this good. What i love about this cd is that it all flows together. The order of tracks is perfect because it keeps building up the energy and breaking back down into acoustic breaks. The new version of Roulette Dares is better than the one i heard before and the new version of Cicatriz is very interesting. I love the instrumental middle part to it. This is one of the best albums of the year that any At The Drive In fan should own. I bought this cd when it came out on tuesday and ive listened to it at least 6 or 7 times since. Everytime i listen to it i notice more and more details that i didnt notice before. I dont wanna say their better than At The Drive In but their at least as good , in a different way. Definetally better than Sparta though. Mexperimental and way better vocals. Cedrics vocal range is crazy in this album.
078322687X|5.0|So, okay, the yuppie snobs called it \\"The Little Chill\\" when it was released. But \\"Breakfast Club\\" is about six times better than \\"The Big Chill\\" (which was a John Sayles ripoff anyway) because it gave us characters who mattered, characters who represented a type but transcended all traps of cliche and stereotype to become real live human beings.<br />Watch the film today, and listen to the beautifully realized dialogue. How did he know? How did John Hughes know that this was how we talked, this is what went on, these were the genuine problems we faced? John wasn't afraid of confronting cliches (the prom queen's divorced parents try to buy her love, the tough kid is abused by his alcoholic dad, etc.) because he knew that for millions of us, those cliches were real, and the fact that our problems weren't even original hurt us all the more. And he delivered all this in an enormously entertaining package, with genuine laughs and killer attitude.<br />I'm not sure the actors were ever as strong as they were in \\"Breakfast Club.\\" Some of them floundered for years shortly after this was released. But man, did they ever figure these characters out to the BONE. Emilio Estevez' performance is more and more impressive with every viewing...his character has the least flash, but he might be the deepest, since he only barely understands how badly he's been hurt by his father's drive. But they ALL nailed their characters. It must have been incredible to be a part of this movie...watching it today brings back those memories like a flood.<br />Is \\"Breakfast Club\\" still relevant today? I don't know, but I sure hope so.
B0000029GA|5.0|Classic album from start to finish.  Goes down as one of the most influential LP's in hip-hop history, and to me ranks as the #2 in hip hop all time behind 2Pac's \\"Me Against the World\\" ('95).  How Nas managed to have 10 bangers in a row on one disc is simply magnificent.  Only negative is that.... I sure wish we could've had at least one more cut on that one!  Sup with that Nas??  Lyrically, Nas holds it down on every song and it appears that he wrote each song as if it was last shot at everything.  He opened and expanded the mental capacities of all who respected it enough to listen, and also solidified himself as one of the nicest lyricists to come about.  This is also the ONLY Nas release in which his production matched his lyrical performances, as heavyweight producers DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, and Large Professor seemed to bring out the best of themselves on this outing.  Outstanding album altogether and being that this was Nas' first LP, it set the new standard for hip hop AND for himself.<br />Best Song:  \\"Represent\\"<BR>Best Lyrical Delivery:  \\"Memory Lane\\" and \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\"<BR>Most Meaningful Song:  \\"One Love\\"<BR>Best Produced Song:  \\"The World is Yours\\" (Pete Rock) **Gotta do another joint w/ him dawg!<br />Masterpiece.....
B00002ND77|4.0|Before seeing this film, I had little respect for Malcolm X.  His views had always seemed to be little more than anti-white rhetoric, empowering a disenfranchised people only by slandering another people.<br />This film, however, offered a different viewpoint.  Spike Lee portrays Malcolm X as a constantly evolving character, from a delinquent youth to a militant Muslim to a post-Hajj Muslim.  He tracks Malcolm X's career from America's prison system through his death.  Denzel Washington is, as always, excellent in his role.<br />Certain scenes truly stand out.  The one that countered my initial expectation that it would just glorify who I thought of as a black separatist was where a white woman approach Malcolm X offering what help she could offer.  He ignores her completely, but the way the scene is presented gives the viewer an understanding of Malcolm X's mentality.<br />In summary, the film is pretty educational.  My only complaint is the final scene, which seemed a little pretentious (a five-minute clip of various kids telling the camera \\"I am Malcolm X\\").  All considered, though, it is an enlightening film.
0895292211|5.0|This seminal work by Dr. Howell fills a much needed void in the nutrition paradigm.  With abundant clinical research to back his findings, he explains the critical importance of consuming foods rich in natural enzymes and how these life-sustaining molecules are destroyed by our modern methods of cooking, sterilizing, and processing foods.  Written on a level basic enough for people with little nutrition background, yet comprehensive enough to take a doctor like myself to a new level of understanding regarding the power of raw foods in both health and disease.  He even takes one quote from the standard \\"bible\\" of anatomy for all U.S. medical schools, Gray's Anatomy, which points out that the human stomach is actually similar to the well known ruminant animals in having two seperate divisions for digestion.   This book, which took over 20 years to compile and originally spanned over 700 pages, was written by a man who dedicated his life to patient care and research.  This is an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning the value of unadulterated food in its natural state for health maintenance, as well as the ultimate natural weapon in conquering disease.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Not many seem to like TATU but my opinion of them is high. As a matter of fact I'm listening to '200 km/h in the wrong lane' right now with 'Not gonna get us' and as I listen to them so much I even know all the words to their songs. My favourite song by them is All the things she said and I'm looking forward to hearing their new song. The people in the group are Lena Katina and Julia Volkova. They're just young teenagers and for their ages they have a very high standard of songs. I've rated them 5 stars and the people with good taste would have rated them the same such as myself. I first heard of TATU in early 2003 and my next door neighbour had been watching the music channel and they mentioned two singers announced that they were lesbians and I was like who are they and they came on with the song All the things she said, normally the first time I come accross new songs I can never be bothered to listen but I was more interested in watching the video but then I got into the music channel and heard it more and more often and started liking TATU and then they became one of my top singers and now whenever I listen to it (which is not very often) it goes really quickily. The problem is that my brother always hogs the remote control and he hates TATU but I can easily get my own way with him.
B000002MFN|5.0|This album came at a time when Madonna's public persona has reached rock bottom.  Too bad. All those bad publicity and that Sex book has diverted all attention from probably Madonna's most mature work to date. Madonna has always craved for artistic cred, to be taken seriously as an artist (er, American Life?).  She should have stopped in 1992 for Erotica is her best lyrically and musically.  No this is not Like a Virgin, that's another facet of Madonna.  Madonna in Erotica is the Madonna she always wanted to be known for.  Too bad everyone was to preoccupied to notice.  If you have not yet done so, buy this classic.
B00005N83M|5.0|I like the way she sings and I like her voice. Her songs are so cool! I like the song &quot;I'm Real&quot; the most. I like the way she dress' and how she dances. I love the music video &quot;I'm Real.&quot;
B00008VGL6|1.0|I can not tell you how excited I was to hear that the person I believe to be one of the greatest song writers in the world was coming up with a follow-up to his earlier Counterfeit EP.  My surprise was how unimpressed I was when I listened to it!  It is #1-a cd of covers and #2 Martin and his guitar. I was hoping for Martin's original ballads, or even some upbeat songs like &quot;Gone&quot; or &quot;Compulsion&quot;  I have never been one to complain about Depeche Mode! I have been a Depeche Mode fan since &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; came out.  I have always loved their music, have always loved to see them whenever they were in town.  I never even have to listen to the cd before I buy because I know it is going to be good.  I just wish that I would have listened to this.  David Gahan's Cd is brilliant!  I was a little skeptical about him, but I could have never been more impressed!  I just hope that they keep putting out the same great music and I just wish that Martin would stick to writing his own music and stop playing other's.
B00005RDCA|5.0|This is a great rock record that has stunning individual talent everywhere in evidence, harnessed together to the Haight-Ashbury communal ethos of the mid-Sixties. Great songwriting, and Jorma Kaukonen writing whole stories with each guitar solo, perhaps the real standout in this group. The digital remix is crisp and exciting, with excellent separation that enhances the important contributions of each member - and blows your head off, too. What I love about this record is the group singing, the ensemble playing, the everybody-on-stage commune atmosphere. Sly and the Family Stone rocked out with the communal San Francisco sound, and invented Funk while they were doing it. What band wouldn't love to have just Grace Slick singing for them, or Marty Balin, or Paul Kantner - but here they're all together in peak form singing together, bringing the San Francisco Summer of Love spirit to the airwaves. This one record, released in Feb. 1967, probably did as much to sell the hippie ideal to the world as any other. They didn't just talk about it, they played it live. The love, peace and freedom and Don't Trust the Establishment lyric themes, sold by Grace, Marty or Paul over crashing drum, bass and guitar attacks, are timely now and again. Like good punk, the rockers are fast, funny, upbeat and slam you around too. Then there are the ballads, full of the dreamy, paisley-patterned poetry of the West Coast folk-rocker. It's all here, and it's beautiful, man.
B000002B5L|4.0|Classic, early 90s rap, before the neo-soul, spoken word, lets-try-to-deep movement came into the play, The Fugees were doing their thing trying to get people to think and had phat bass lines to go along with it. This is a classic from back in the day and every CD collection should have it whether you are a hip-hop head or not. Don't sleep on this talented trio, they are all talented and have proven to be stars in their own right, but together they offered listeners a fantastic collection of their work.<br />The Score gets a top score from me....check it out
B00000IQC8|1.0|If I didn't see Mallrats first. I bought this movie because Mallrats was awesome, and found that after that movie (which my buddies and I still watch every now and again) this movie totally blows. Perhaps it's the B&W, perhaps the budget, but I think it's the script and lack of directorial experience. Sorry Kevin, this one's a stinker. I'm glad so many people disagree with me, or one of my favorite movies would have never come to existence. That's all I have to say about that.<br />P.S. The original ending would have upped my rating, but since it was cut, nevermind
B00008PX8P|5.0|For anyone who even considers himself to be a true Zep fan this is a MUST OWN DVD!     If all you've seen are the overplayed (and let's face it) disappointing Madison Square Gardens footage from the movie \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" then get ready to see the mighty, mighty Led Zeppelin as you've never seen them before!      Disc One has incredibly rare early TV European performances but the real treat for most fans are on Disc Two which charges at you with an unseen powerhouse version of 'The Immigrant Song' and gets better from there.   Where else can you see live performances of 'Achilles Last Stand' (arguably one of their best songs), 'In My Time of Dying', or 'Nobody's Fault But Mine'?     It's also amazing to note that even at end of their career as a band, it's always been the same four guys playing all the songs in concert. No extra musicians on stage (guitarists, keyboards, strings, percussionists, etc.) to re-create their sound as most bands would do. That is a true testament to their abilities as musicians.    If you haven't already done so, buy this DVD!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Okay, I'll start with the bad stuff.  \\"Dazed and Confused\\" is waaaay too long, even if it's shorter here than on Song Remains The Same.  And I can easily live without a 17-minute drum solo in \\"Moby Dick.\\"  And where's the stuff they recorded after Houses of the Holy?<br />I'm finished griping.  The energy level of this set is amazing, and it puts SRTS to shame (and this set was recorded only about a year earlier).  While the studio Zep was polished and finessed, the live Zep we get here is a powerhouse.  And almost everything works, even without eight bazillion overdubs.  The three acoustic songs at the end of Disc 1 work surprisingly well live (I've never thought much of Page as a lead guitarist, but his acoustic skills make me green with envy).  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is 23 minutes long, but instead of the pointless doodling in \\"Dazed and Confused\\" the guys throw in a medley of '50s rock and roll.<br />In short, this album kicks A-double-S.  If you like Led Zeppelin, you HAVE to buy this album.
B00008J4P5|5.0|In today's music world dominated by rap music, divas, and<BR>boy and girl bands, the White Stripes swoop in like a <BR>welcome whirlwind. \\"Elephant\\" rocks like there's no tomorrow!<BR>This is not to say that the Stripes don't have a more <BR>sensitive side.  They do - and \\"Elephant\\" shows it.  <br />Do yourself (and them) a huge favor - buy this f'n CD!  You won't<BR>regret it.
0679720200|4.0|Meursault, a frenchman living in Algeria (poor guy) lives a normal life. His mother died (does it mather?), he started dating Marie (don't speak of love) and he helped his &quot;friend&quot; Raymond when some Arabs wanted to attack him. He is a complete stranger to others, you don't know what he feels. All you know: he hates hot and sunny places and doesn't understand what he can't smell, touch or eat. Then he kills and is sent to prison. There he finally understands lifes meaning, the absurdity, what it all ment. Is it too late?<BR>I was agreably surprised when I read this book. Usually, what we read in French Litterature is horrible (like Zola, Maupassant, ...) but this was quite nice, perhaps a little boring at times. The story is short and you read it very fast. The characters are quite sympatic, even if Meursault is a little strange. <BR>It's really easy to analyse after you've understood how it works. I got the best marks when I analysed it at school. It's funny to read it after you've analysed it, because the story is much more deeper. It's a fine base for a philosophical debate on the absurdity of life and Camus has got some interessing ideas. <BR>You should really read it in French like I did, it's a lot better and the traslation is sometimes weird.<BR>If you're a teacher and want your class to read something more enjoyable than Zola, choose this book. Some can enjoy it (not me).
1878424319|5.0|This book gripped me like few have ever done before. The AWARENESS that Don Miguel Ruiz brings humanity about our mental \\"agreements\\" that we have been taught, and have subsequently attached ourselves to, have been the basis for all human suffering. The gift this book brings us are the simple, yet impeccable manner in which we can break those inner agreements, once we are aware of what they are. To be impeccable with your word, because it carries so much power, both to hurt, and to heal. To not take anything personally, because people do what is coming from their OWN belief system, and truly has nothing to do with us. The big one for me was: \\"Don't Make Assumptions.\\"<br />Making assumptions, instead of having the guts to ask questions to gain clarity, has certainly caused much pain for me. I would venture to say I am not alone in this category.<br />I learned a new way to view \\"problems\\" as \\"agreements\\" I took on during various stages of my life. Most importantly, I learned to replace those agreements (in whatever way I am the Victim or the Judge) and to make new agreements that suite me, and myself alone, without the need for approval of anyone.<br />With new agreements, we become FREE to truly love: ourselves, to love all others, and to release judgment and blame.<br />This is a powerful book that can be read within an hour. I highly recommend it!<br />From my heart,<br />Barbara Rose, author of \\"Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE\\" and 'If God Was Like Man'<br />Editor of inspire! magazine
B00006AW2G|3.0|In my car, on my computer, and in my Sony Discman, the sound quality jumps out--truly amazing.  But buyer beware, this cd will not play in all machines.  For my home stereo system, I use a Panasonic DVD/CD Player; Model DVD-RP 56.  This cd will not play--very frustrating!  <br />I wrote to ABKCO about this problem nearly a month ago--no response to date....
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Although this really isn't one of the genres I like to watch, About a Boy turned out to be a very uplifting and funny movie that was worth my time watching it.  But it probably would've been just another average romantic comedy if it had not have been for Hugh Grant's presence.<br />Grant has always been in these kind of movies and always does a good job with what he's given, regardless if it's actually a good movie or not.  But, luckily, About a Boy is one of Grant's better films, more for the comedy than anything else.<br />The only real flaw about the movie is that Hugh Grant's character is a little too annoying.  Sure, I know that he's supposed to be a little unlikeable, but I think they went a little too far.  Oh well, it doesn't hurt the film too much.<br />BOTTOM LINE:  Watch this movie if you like Hugh Grant or if you want to see a light-hearted comedy.  Very, very funny. (4 stars out of 5)
B000031XCR|5.0|WOW!! this cd leaves u so speechless that u dont even want 2 sing 2 the songs!!!I love ,dont hesitate 2 buy it!!
