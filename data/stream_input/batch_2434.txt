B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The re mastered version of Abbey Road is at least as good if not better than the original England version vinyl LP that I bought years ago.  I was a little concerned that it might not be but the clarity is really quite good.  I consider this to be money well spent.
B004UHL9EK|3.0|It seems like a good app, however I don't have my tablet on 24/7 so many times the schedued time is over before I see it.  Not really qualified to really rate this, but it does seem to be a decent app.
B00003Q43A|5.0|this movie, especially the extended version was even more fantastic than the original! everyone around the world bands together to save the world and celebrate an international version of the most important american holiday &#34;independence day&#34;! a top-notch sci-fi film well done, roland emerich!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This series has been great from the Pilot.  Stephen Amell is great as The Arrow and one of my favorite entertainers joined the cast right away, John Barrowman, which just made it all the better!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This game is pretty fun and has a good story progression with the releases of all the consoles. Definitely a 5/5!
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|The lyrics on some of the songs on this CD are pretty deep.  Iggy is not a crazy as he used to be but this CD will not be a disappointment for true fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game!  It is very addicting and I really have a good time when playing it.  It's a hands on experience that could possibly help someone get into the world of horses for real.  You learn the basic things that a horse needs.  It's just very enjoyable! I hope everyone likes this :)
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was a fun read, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh and different.<br />I thought it was just enough to keep you interested.  The pictures really added some depth to the story.<br />It was not an overly detailed and deep book.  Just a quick, easy and fun read.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|'The Abduction' is classic Grisham; clearly written with a believable story line. The novel would appeal to younger readers more than a mature readership. Having said that, however, the author does capture the readers interest with a fluid, belivable narrative involving a lad in his early teens looking to solve the mysterious disappearance of his friend and classmate. The novel is more commendable for writing qality than inherent suspense or drama.
B0067R0APK|5.0|You might as well pay for the upgrade . . . not just to get rid of the annoying adds but to be able to fully use this app and have access to all if its functions.  The upgrades have improved it dramatically.<br /><br />MOD
B002TVQ4AS|5.0|Outstanding documentary of some amazing old musicians getting rediscovered years after their time, and winding up at Carnegie Hall. Incredible music. Incredible story. A time-capsul of 1940's Cuban music, which is outstanding.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like being able to see pictures of my family and friends who live in different states. It's our way of staying in touch.
0802473156|5.0|This can help couples better understand how to express their love for each other. The little quiz in the back is probably something that couples should take every 3-5 years.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is their best book I've ever read! It leaves you hanging and makes you want to never stop reading! I absolutely recommend this book to teens and adults.
B00BI5J9BC|4.0|A tremendous cast and impeccable production values make Les Miserable a must see. I was unable to see this movie on the big screen and this epic film and story would have been greatly enhanced on a larger format. The movie is a bit long for a home-setting-date-night. I could have survived without Russell Crowe's singing but his acting is spot-on. Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway are superb!
0062200909|5.0|I loved every minute of this book, great pictures and drawings that really show how much work was put into creating the charecters and their distinctive looks.<br />It was interesting to have a peak into the creation process  of the costumes and the environment of the movies, and also the fact that the actors themselves had a say in how their costumes will look.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I watched this movie because I like gangster movies and also, I'm a big fan of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  I think the acting is good by all actors except Nick Nolte.  If you want a movie to watch for entertainment purposes, then this is a good one.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|My 11 year old son and I went in with high hopes... soon dashed by the endless explosions, cutesy jokes, exaggerated cgi, pointless 3D, and mindless plot.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley and the Mandarin character: totally wasted.<br /><br />I wonder... Do Marvel, the writers, the directors, start out wanting to make this kind of movie?
B004B8DH98|1.0|Can't believe George Clooney would act or direct this movie.  All around, it was horrible ...... acting and the storyline.  It was say too predictable and just plain BORING!!!<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this one.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I think the concept is interesting, but didn't do much for me with weight loss. Whatever I lost on the fast days came right back on in between. Granted, I'm 53 & weight loss is 10 times harder now than it was in my 20s.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Kept us on the edge of our seat from the very begining to the very end. Really enjoyed everybit of the movie.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was a thrilling and riveting book through and through. Very difficult to put down.  Can't wait to read \\"The Hit.\\"
B00070DK1E|5.0|Has several songs I consider to be great. A must for any Jethro Tull fan. Added to my collection of JT.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Unlike some other noise generators I've tried, I don't notice any gaps when things loop (although I've only tried some of the loops).
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Very few bands can create a sound that can't be duplicated . Volbeat has mastered this. No other band to compare them to as they are in a league of their own.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|My wife and I enjoy this wonderful performer.  We especially like it when he sings in English, which he does on two selections on this CD:  \\"When I Fall in Love,\\" and \\"Love Me Tender.\\"  You will be pleased with the gentle renditions by this true gentleman.
1401937519|5.0|I am really enjoying this book... all of it. I like hearing about her childhood, her issues growing up, her marriage, and her NDE. Very intelligently written, this is one good book!<br />I am not a Christian, yet I was raised Catholic-Christian- and although I see Wayne Dyer had to bring Jesus in, I have not run into this from the author and it is refreshing. Living in the U.S. it is awful, constantly seeing Christianity as the yardstick on these books. The book is uplifting.<br />Shockingly I see on Kindle that people are writing a Christian rebuttal to this book. So unloving.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My mom has me hooked on this show. There's drama, action, & romance. Love it! Too bad season 3 we have to pay for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a fun game that lets your imagination soar it has every thing you could imagine to let your imagination fly
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I liked the story. It was well written, sometimes long on technicalities but used to that in her books.If you a Reichs fan you will enjoy this book.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This is a great action sci-fi movie that does a good job of rebooting the Star Trek franchise.  It does a good job of going back to the action style of TOS.
0385344325|5.0|If you like Reacher it`s your cup of tea. Just like John Wayne, Lee Child has his own personna and doesn`t vary it.<br />Only the plot changes.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Season 2 did not disappoint. This is an awesome show! Lots of great plot twists and character development.  Will definitely buy the remaining seasons.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|Been awhile since I've seen anything from Boz and Memphis doesn't disappoint. Love his smooth, unique voice. Can sit and listen to these tunes and mellow out after a tough day.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Just started watching this show and I love it! It has become one of my favorite shows.  The show is extremely well written and the actors are perfect. The characters are complex and intriguing.  I will definitely buy all the remaining seasons.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We watched season one and then season two. We are hooked. There is nothing not to like about this series.
1569242739|4.0|It's a nice book. I'm just not into this. I will give it to my mom who has been vegan half her life. She's now 85!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is fun and easy! The graphics are great as well. Anyone would enjoy it. I would recommend. it to anyone.
0307460444|5.0|I'm not a really big Martha Stewart fan but oh me I love this cook book! Just looking at the pictures makes me smile. They are not only beautiful but they really look real! They make me feel better just looking at the pictures! Only made two recipes and fantastic is how they turned out. Pictures really say a thousand words!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I totally loved the Rio version of this game.  It is the only one that I have actually finished.  The other games are good<br />but  I really enjoyed this one.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|I watch this movie every time I get a chance.  I like the cast and the way the movie unfolds.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved reading this book bc of  the relationship description. It was so easy to relate to! Thank you for writing!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't know what all the hype was about, but when I finally decided to read it... my goodness! I don't think I've experienced anything like it!
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I tlhad high hopes for this movie based on the cast and production. But sadly it fell short in the comedy arena. Not funny, predictable sophomoric jokes about bein pregnant and fatherhood. So glad i didnt pay to watch it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Happy to finally have the final volume of a truly great fantasy series but sad that there won't be any more. The book answers many questions but not all which is as Robert Jordan wanted. I, along with many others, would love to have more information on what happened during the final volume as well as what happens after, but we all knew it wasn't going to happen. A truly outstanding read of a truly outstanding series!
0307596885|5.0|My favorites in this collection are as follows:<br /><br />(1) \\"Gravel\\" - Heartbreaking story about a woman who leaves her bourgeois suburban marriage to live the bohemian life in a trailer with her actor boyfriend, circa the late '60s/early '70s.  This abrupt lifestyle shift deeply affects the older of her two daughters and leads to devastation and unanswered questions.  I love that Munro neither champions nor directly criticizes the girls' mother's actions.  The emotions this story evokes are every bit as messy and complicated as they are in real life.<br /><br />(2) \\"Train\\" - This time the central figure is male.  Though this story deals with deviant, and even the absence of, sexual desire, and what society considers normal, it's more \\"about\\" the lies we tell ourselves to get through the day, to get on with our lives.  Lots of pain in this one...perhaps even an extended metaphor for the artist's/writer's life...the feeling of being forever untethered, restless, unstable...the longest story in the collection that took me two reads to begin to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />(3) \\"In Sight of the Lake\\" - Another extended metaphor for the lonely, alienated life of the artist...(to me, at least), this time largely from the perspective of an elderly woman who fears the gradual loss of her mental powers.  But is her mind deteriorating or becoming more imaginative?  Is Nancy crazy - or is it the rest of the world that's nuts?<br /><br />(4) \\"Dolly\\" - Probably the best one to start with for those new to Munro.  Here, an elderly woman narrator, cut off from the outside world writing about neglected female Canadian authors (kind of funny for Munro to do this), has her comfortable but unfulfilling life disrupted by the arrival of her husband's old flame.  This story asks so much of us - how much are we willing to settle for?  How much are we willing to risk?  Are the consequences of acting out on our inner passions worth it?<br /><br />(5) \\"The Eye\\" - The first of four directly autobiographical stories from Munro's childhood that close the collection.  About an independent, guitar-playing, dance hall-attending young woman named Sadie, who is the absolute antithesis of Munro's mother.  The private moment when Munro sees Sadie's eye -- a revelation that no one else sees -- is something to be treasured.<br /><br />(6) \\"Night\\" - Similar to \\"Train\\" in its theme of hiding or blocking out a taboo thought.  The relationship between the tumor removed from Munro during her appendectomy and the thoughts that swirl in her head the summer following the operation is fascinating...as is the stunning ending, a sublime moment Munro and her father share together at 5:00 a.m.<br /><br />(7) \\"Voices\\" - This story is a masterpiece among masterpieces.  And it's one of Munro's shortest stories, about her desire to pull away from her mother's sphere of influence as well as the first stirrings of her own budding sexuality.  (In this way, it's similar to \\"The Eye\\" and even \\"Night.\\")  Munro and her mother go together to a dance at a neighbor's house only to leave shortly afterward because of how Munro's mother feels about one of the women at the party.  On the way out, Munro sees a girl crying on the stairs being comforted by whispers from soldiers about to return to battle in WWII...voices that have stayed with Munro all the way into her eighties...<br /><br />I found the other stories to not be quite on the same level as these seven, though a couple come close.  Then again, maybe I just need to give those others more time to fully work their magic.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game there is new speacial rooms that are often available and fun room unlocked after leveling up! This game is always keeping me on my toes!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great viewing entertainment. Wholesome, well written and actors are exceptional. It is hard to find good quality entertainment, this is a gem.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Like the rest of the season, this is a great episode. Spoiler alert - Alicia dominates again.  And her husband does too.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching because this came up in my recommendations and I am hooked!  I've been watching on Amazon instant video.  The characters are very realistic, the story line is smart and thoughtful.  I loved Juliana Marguiles in ER and I love her here too!
B007SGLZH6|5.0|It is definitely a great asset if you want to learn how to bake amazing breads at home. It does not give many recipes but it does much better than that: it gives you the basis to get to understand what is needed for baking great bread without too much extra equipment at home.<br /><br />Love it!
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|Do not start this book unless you have a free day or evening to read it as you won't want to put it down. A love story but like no other. The characters are so well drawn and endearing, I can see the movie already!<br />I have already recommended it to my daughter, mother-in-law, friends and even strangers in book shops.
B001BJNIIK|1.0|We made it 80% of the way through this movie and then it quit on us.  This is ridiculous for paying for a rental.  Don't spend money on service this cheap.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book looks like a gimmick from the cover and title, but if you do the exercises and give it a chance even for a week you will find that its the real deal. The exercise progressions are worth the price of the book alone. Anybody at any fitness level can jump in and get started right away. There are only six exercises with multiple skill level variations, so working out with this program takes a half hour or less a day, and can be done anywhere. No equipment required just your body and the will to improve your life. Yes the book is expensive but the thing is quite massive. Full of pictures showing exactly how to do the exercises. It doesn't get better than this. Give it a shot! You won't be disappointed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Worked exactly as described. The specs were consistent with what I needed and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play on it all the time it really helps me with my reactions as you have to be quick to survive!!! :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought I would read what everyone was discussing at work.  I didn't realize it was a Girly book and only got half thru.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|If you download this game, your being taken advantage of even at free it should not be gotten.When you make fake five star reviews it shows that something is wrong with your game and that you know you have to balance out what you did wrong and the bad reviews that will come
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Worked exactly as described. The specs were consistent with what I needed and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B000MPSX34|5.0|I've seen this movie numerous times and I always get chills at the end. It's just so heart warming. I highly recommend it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best horror series ever!!!!!!!  Season two is even better than season 1!  Actors are great.  VERY good special effects, i highly recommend it!
B0019IB0II|5.0|I found this book to be very insightful<br />concerning how one can keep moving<br />forward in their life after going through<br />a life changing situation as Jill did,<br />Not feeling bitter, but growing and being<br />thankful for what she has learned and become.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I wanted to read this before the movie comes out later this year. I couldn't put it down once I started. Personally, I thought the ending was a little strange, and as a result I'm not enthusiastic about reading the next book in the series. Maybe someday.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|AWESOME!!!!  A LOT OF FUN AND QUICK.  Everyone should try this game I think you will love it. the game is very exciting.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I honestly wasn't sure about this book when I first heard of it. A &#34;novel&#34; about IT stuff, really? The truth is, I love novels, and I couldn't put this one down. I'm sure it helps that I'm in IT, but I found myself referring to and recommending this book to all my colleagues. It's a quick read, and I'd bet if you're in the business, you'll take away something useful from it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It surely wakes me up every morning! Does the job it was downloaded to do. It has as many alarms as those who go comatose in the night require to make it to their mediocre jobs on time.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I enjoy building the reef but a glitches seems to be preventing me from accessing rare seeds. It looks like it will be difficult to move on without them.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|Most well designed apps works well on this Slll. I have only used this app a few times but so far it does what it says it will and it's easy to use. That's about all you can ask for.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|Developers that create fake reviews are basically scum. Deceiving people by creating fake reviews is the trait of greedy, immoral, low life, scumbags that prey on others. If you want SPYWARE and an opportunity to support greedy developers then this app is perfect to you.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Love the show. Fan of Star Trek TV show and movies. Watched on amazon with my Amazon Prime account.  Great deal.
1401324649|5.0|This book was pure delight. Funny, believable and a great ride. The characters came alive without to much fluff. I loved it.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This show is intelligent , witty, funny and educational ( for recovering addicts ).  I love scripted shows with a touch of these elements , I tend to gravitate to mystery , murder and the cat and mouse crime shows with unique twists.  The Elementary keeps my attention and gives me pleasure to watch an excellently scripted show.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This HO game has it all, at least for me.  I've &#34;solved&#34; it many times over and I will again.  It's very easy to navigate, challenging but not impossible to solve without using the hints, has excellent graphics and the HO screens are well done.  Finding out which are the necessary objects doesn't take frustrating guess-work.  The HO lists are clear and straightforward, unlike some who seem to believe figuring out which items are to be located is half the fun!  For me, the puzzles should be a challenge, not the HO lists.<br />The storyline makes sense, the game has a very smooth flow and you get what you paid for!  None of this &#34;if you want to play the FUN part of the game, it will cost another $2.99&#34; from this seller.  You get exactly what was offered.<br />If you're looking for a great game that will provide hours of enjoyment, don't pass on this one.  I'm sure you won't be sorry.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|This is not an action movie, but it is filled with tension and intrigue. Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors that you can count on to accept only top notch scripts. This story was very well written and the plot was filled with twists and turns. Definitely worth a rental. It is not one I would own, but I do not own many movies. If you like political stories, filled with sex, scandal, abuse of power, this is for you. It is also a love story, but not in the sweet sticky way. And it is a story about justice. Definitely recommend taking a look, especially if you are a fan or Wahlberg and/or Crowe.
B004MPEVWC|1.0|My son warned me to steer clear of the sequel, but he warned me too late.  I had already added this disaster to my collection.  As it turns out, it went right to the &#34;boy don't you wish you hadn't pressed the buy button&#34; shelf of my collection.  I got through it, but it wasn't easy.  At least I have the original version to look forward to ...... I am told that is worth the hype.  My opinion to follow on that ........
B008CPZNL6|2.0|In my opinion, I found no value in this magazine, Could hardly  wait to remove from my file to remove it from my file.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This product provides everything offered.  I use it often and I like being able to have different types of clocks.  The alarm sounds provided are pretty good.  It performs as promised all the time.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|After absolutely LOVING the first Boondock Saints and forcing everyone in my family to watch it I of course had to give this one a try. It was awesome!  I now have owned this movie for a while and I ordered and just recieved a second copy for my dads birthday present because he loved the first one just as much as I did. He was super excited and can't wait to watch it. I would recommend this movie to anyone but you really need to see the first one so you know fully what is going on. It would still be good if you did't though, but would be better if you did!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a fun, challenging game. Lots to do. The mini games can be a challenge, but some are rather simple. The hog's are fun with some items needing put together to be &quot;found&quot;. If you got the free version the description tells you that there is purchase content. I am playing in the expert mode for a better challenge, the hog areas are not highlighted. I've been playing about 2 hours, off and on, and just now reached the purchase point.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had heard of Nikolai Tesla, but I didn't realize that he was so influential in the works of our modern world. I've always heard that Thomas Edison was the real genius, but it sounds like he was a scoundrel. Very inspiring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played I love it this is my most favoite game of all time!!!!!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|A good beach story. It'll keep<br />You interested at least.  But if you're interested in something with a lot if character development keep looking.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock has quickly become my most favorite show ever... and that is saying something when it goes up against shows like Firefly, Warehouse 13, X-Files, Eureka, Doctor Who, Castle, etc.<br /><br />There are only three episodes per season but they dedicate a full 90 minutes to each.I think all of my favorite shows should adopt the 90 minute per show concept without taking away episodes.  This allows them to really flesh out each story and makes for a better telling.<br /><br />Sherlock has some of the smartest dialog and best character selection.  The only &#34;negative&#34; comment, which is trivial, is I wish they wouldn't make Watson a sub-par character compared to Sherlock.  I always pictured Watson as being Sherlock's peer... a sub-par peer but a peer none-the-less; a strong character in his own right.  Currently he doesn't help with the cases a lot but it seems to increase with each episode.  It is too early to tell but they may be building Watson into the peer he should be as he learns more of the power of deduction that Sherlock has mastered.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I really like the game of Mahjong but on some shuffles the tiles are too small to see easily on my Samsung Fusion (which has a very large).  Don't know how you could see them on other phones.  My phone freezes sometimes when I am matching tiles very rapidly.  But its free so I will continue to play..
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app to get the stations that are not available on iHeart radio. We use it to get AM stations for games and local weather!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I wasn't expecting it to be so good! I kept buying one episode after another. The acting is excellent! The story line is amazing.<br />I am actually holding off on the latest episodes, so I can watch several together:)
B0092SPYQG|5.0|Papa Roach knocks it out of the park with their latests release. Every song is great and they continue to pump out the hits.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This is not for professionals with high resolution results and professional cameras. For normal pics taken at outings, some domestic occasions or birthdays using ordinary film cameras this scanner does wonders. I am more than happy to recommend it to any person who has that pile of old 35mm negative in their store eating dust. Use this scanner to preserve your memories. I kept laughing while scanning my old negatives because every moment just flashed before my eyes when that pic was taken. Thank you DB tech. I would highly recommend this to any person. and yes it is easy to use.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|What can I say?  This movie is a true classic from a time when the actors were the movie and movies weren't dependent on a lot of special gimmicks to keep the audience interested.  Back in that era if an actor couldn't cut it you couldn't cover it up with fluff and this movie is one of the all time bests.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Came brand new! Exactly what I remember it being when I was a kid watching it. I love this movie, but I have to admit, the animation is a little cheesy now that I am used to Transformers CGI
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say about The Walking Dead that hasn't been said already? Great show, will always keep me on the edge of my seat. Zombies beware!
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Good efects.<br />Good story, sometimes better than others.<br />I need to finish all chapters, up to the middle I recommend it.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|The game looked like it could have been fun.....NOT! I could not wait to delete it. I had played a game similar to this one on pogo, this was not even close.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game. My high score is I've 243000 and 1500 coins. The Tokyo version right now is terrible. The coins spin and the graphics are awful. Also it is so hard to get the tho vs to get prizes. Th  little icons.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|i thought this game was like the movie but its not its more like temple run but in a better way<br />you have to fly fighting with drones and extremis, another good thing is that you unlock armors
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you like super hero's, this will be so awesome!!! Get this game. I am really telling you too! Right here, right now, today. Oh my goodness just get it.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Cute game with cute penguins. My son can play it and I like it too. It handles well on my iconia tablet and his 7 inch tablet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so nerve racking and it leaves you wanting to read more. This is the best book ever.
0062014536|4.0|For Lena, the security she once had of a house and a home seems like it was something she must have dreamed long ago.  Those memories have taken on a softer faded recall in her mind and sometimes she has to wonder if what she recalls is even true...<br /><br />For now, since the rescue of Julian, Lena finds herself along with the rest of her group of invalids, back in the Wilds.  To Lena, this is a comfort as she finally feels like she is on familiar ground.  For Jillian, this is new and unfamiliar territory.  He is out of hos comfort zone but as any of the \\"invalids\\" as they are so called, have come to know... it never pays to feel too comfortable.<br /><br />And then there is Alex.  Now back, he is shocked and hurt to see that Lena has moved on and no amount of Lena's explaining how long she had hoped and prayed that he was alive was anything he wanted to listen too.  Thrown back together in this final book of the series, both Lena and Alex need to learn how to move forward together in their cause but separate in their lives.<br /><br />The Wilds are no longer the safe place they used to be.  Now Regulators have been seen searching the Wilds to eliminate the world of people just like Lena, Julian, and Alex... people who have decided that the ability to love...<br /><br />just might be something worth fighting for.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver should be commended.  From those first pages of Delirium, to the final pages of Requiem.... I was hooked into this storyline of love being a disease that must be eliminated.  Fascinating stuff for me... I imagine for younger YA readers, it even holds a stronger pull.<br /><br />Bu what impresses me about the series is that each book - while linked together, are very different stories and very different settings.  Even though Requiem takes you back to the Wilds, it is not the Wilds that we knew in the second book, Pandemonium.  This ability to change up the location but keep things rolling with all the new rules and new dangers as well as hold true to the world that once was Lena's is exhilarating.  To be kept up to speed through the words of her best friend Hannah who still is in Portland, about to be married to her pair, after her procedure, levels this book out to its page turning crashing conclusion.<br /><br />Requiem held strong to its upbringing and brings a different side to the battle that I enjoyed.  I thoroughly liked all three of the books and recommend this YA series.well as hold true to the world that once was Lena's is exhilarating.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was outstanding & kept me guessing throughout.  I would definitely recommend it to other mystery lovers.  There has to be a sequel.  Anxiously waiting
0756688701|5.0|I got this for my grandson and he loved it.  He collects the cars characters so this was perfect information for him... My husband collects some of the cars and he even thought it was really neat and informational as well as fun.
0525478817|5.0|This is an excellent book, I would recommend it to anyone who likes romance and a good plot. Also DFTBA.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|In reading the book, it made me aware of what it takes to be in charge of global companies.  Admired his loyalty to his adoptive parents and his own family.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The &#34;closed&#34; Amazon environment did not allow me to d/l the Weather Underground, which I use on my PC. I tried this, but like the &#34;parent&#34;--the Weather Channel on TV--I found it wanting. The TV version USED to be fairly good, giving us our local forecasts, but now it is just a jumble of all 50 states and very annoying otherwise.<br /><br />The app was not to my liking either. I use an app that Amazon seems to have &#34;liaised&#34; from ABC News, Channel 7, here in New York so at least I have my local weather. Mostly, I don't really care what the temperature/forecast is for Indianapolis...any more than THEY would care what's going on here!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is one of my preferred authors. Love the ways he describes events, very animated, draws you into the story.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's fine. It DOES come with an ad and doesn't just pop up as soon as one taps it, but once you &#34;get to&#34; the calculator (and it's really not difficult), it works. Like any calculator.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|It just gets to where you cannot do anything after a little while. Even if you spend money it is still too difficult.
0525953728|5.0|2013-05-04
0545265355|5.0|This is a nice hard covered set, not a cheap paperback one. It is always nice to have a collectors set of books that comes with a case.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|It didn't run very well - very slow and halting.  It is best to just use Silk's own desktop setting.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|We all love this, from my almost 4 year old up to the adults. Fun, interesting, easy enough to play for all but challenging in the goals so adults don't get bored.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Sometimes I need a flash friendly browser.  Dolphin is just the thing for those times.  Pretty fast and easy to navigate!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I received this set for my birthday from my husband. I loved all the movies and have watched them all already. Harry Potter ROCKS!!!
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I just loved this movie, but if Disney thinks I'm going to pay full price for a 3D only Blu with ugly packaging while selling the 2D/DVD version with all the extras, they can think again.  I guess this one won't be sitting on my shelf.  Shame on you Disney!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I can't get enough of Connelly.  The Harry Bosch books are the best, this book is no exception.  The plot takes us to a place that I didn't see coming.  If Connelly keeps writing them, I will keep reading them.
0307476073|4.0|I liked the book a lot, though I had mixed feelings about the author throughout.  I will share my book so others can experience her trip.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An amazing book!! Makes you want to read til the end, never wanting to put the book down! I was sad to finish! Can't wait till the next book!! I was reading this in the car and once I finish I screamed! He left us with a HUGE cliffhanger!!!!!<br />This book is highly recommended to everyone who is interested mythology and action! I personally love the fact that I am able to learn more about Greek and Roman gods and goddesses in a way that is so fascinating! I read this while my class while my class was reading the Oddessy and I thanks to also reading The lightning thief series (must read first to get the whole story!) I was able to pass that class with flying colors!<br />I love these books can't wait til house of hades!!!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Gives the readers a view of Alzheimer's from the patients perspective rather than the outside looking in. Extremely touching, had me in tears more than once.  So well written, heartfelt and touching
B0050JN864|5.0|Great documentary of the Mach IV Deep Purple line-up.... No need to give Deep purple history here if you're looking at this DVD  - let me just say it is well done and a  good documentary.... You will enjoy it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Saw neg reviews on this item and will say that I did not run across any problems.  I've had it for a few months and it's just perfect.  Works first time, every time.. no peeling, no problems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing u can change to like new York to Sydney to Tokyo to all sorts of things
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|It was Ok a little bit to hip hoppy for me. Sorry Justin! Maybe sloww down . Not make the songs so long.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This a late night 'can't put it down' read! Great story with an entertaining North Korean backdrop. One of my best reads in a long time. Thank you!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Very good movie, deserved to be in the best picture category.  All of the actors were really great. If you are deciding between buying and renting you should probably just buy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl has a really interesting premise and it's well-written. However, the two main characters are incredibly unlikable and the ending is weak. Gillian Flynn likes dark, wierd characters (I've read another of her books, too), but too such an extreme that I find myself not caring what happens to them. I like quirky characters, but some of her characters have no redeeming qualities.
B001OKQ7BG|5.0|I did not become an Elvis fan until 1987 so I had never been to a concert. The video was like being there. I have watched it many times in the past and was so glad that Amazon notified me of it's availability.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicting! I play every night after work. Always trying to beat my highest score. So much fun. The best is trying to unlock new characters.
0385349831|5.0|rereading over and over. it s very amazing book,using simple language very easy to ready and understand, deep thought .
B001R4MEYS|5.0|This album is their best work, hands down. Every track on this album is excellent and the overall concept is handled with surprising delicacy.
1400052181|4.0|The story is fascinating and important, something we all should be aware of.  There are many characters to keep track of and I felt the need for more scientific understanding than I have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS APP IS ABBSOLUTELY AWESOME LIKE SERIOUSLY I LUV IT. IT ROX. ITS SOOOOOO MUCH FUN. ESPECIALLY SUBWAY SURFERS ROME
0307476464|3.0|The story is certainly unusual and holds a reader's interest.  BUT, it's too long, more of a time committment than I want.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Any 11 year old would love this as a gift. One of my daughters favorite boy bands. She loved this cd.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I was very impressed with this. Firstly, the acting all around was great. Who ever it was that coached the children did a wonderful job as even the youngest one seems more \\"real\\" than most child actors I've seen. The CGI was good as well and helps a lot to really bring you there when it happened. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and do recommend it to anyone.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|If not for MM, this would be another scary-creepy murder cop show. MM adds a depth not only as the character of Hannibal, but as an actor who can seemingly project that inner universe that gives depth to whatever role he takes on. Even in this most understated performance, he's got it going on. The rest of the cast performs well enough, but not well enough to grab me. The stories are suitably creepy and convoluted and oh-so-modern quick cuts and flashes. The art direction and imagery are quite good.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've tried others apps and I finally found all I want in the tunein pro. I highly suggest you to try it!
1416550550|5.0|This is a well written book. One that is hard to put down. I've only gotten 1/2 way through so I can not blow the ending for you. What I can tell you is that is is a bit of a mystery, & love story. But not in the way you would normaly think. A must buy.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I tried it and loved the way you have to think about the next move.  I got it because it was the free app of the day.
B0014KA0EG|5.0|It's Alice in Chains they're good but I think this is there best album it's a must buy for anyone who likes 90s grunge rock
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Really enjoyed Jamie's story.  So glad those awful institutions have been abolished!  Loved the other characters as well. Nice first novel.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Amazing series. Brilliantly written and developed. The novels are so captivating that it's difficult to put them down.<br />Cannot wait for the next one.
B0064MT1FI|3.0|This was a very interesting movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect. The ending had an interesting twist. Not your usual type of love story.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Love it. Great cast, brilliant script, hilariously funny. Such nasty people - I'm embarrassed to say I was rooting for the bad guy all the way!
B008GAV6YA|5.0|Most potty books that I've purchased for my daughter always include some mention of accidents and of accidents being \\"ok\\".  While having an accident is ok, and I'd never shame my daughter for having one, she took it as license to have \\"accidents\\" on purpose, laugh, and then repeat said line from various book.  There is NO mention of accidents in this book.  Phew!  If you read it in an animated tone of voice and talk about what's going on in the book, it helps to flesh out a rather simple story.  She has memorized the book as well so it's nice for her to use as \\"reading material.\\"  She's 2.5 yrs old now and decided to potty train herself a couple of weeks ago (after a miserable week of potty training hell a few months ago).  She LOVES this book!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Its funny, I'm loving the new Bond movies, but they don't necessarily feel like James Bond to me.  I can't tell if that's good or bad.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|This is a great great concert. There is so much energy and time put into these songs. The best yet of this group. If you love S.Red as I do this is a must. It will get your toes tapping and your feet moving. Very recommended.
B003Y7PM5E|5.0|Even if you missed &#34;Into the Wild&#34; movie, do not miss out on the soundtrack.  Vedder performs some genuinely heart aching music.
B004LE90ZC|5.0|A great book. Very satisfactory purchase. Thank you for making it available on Amazon Kindle, and I will never delete it. Please keep up your great offers.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This film was great because it was something different from most of the movies out there today. It was real. It was funny, frustrating, and had just the right amount of romance. I would definitely watch it again.
B002AS463W|3.0|I am yet to watch it. I bought it for him as a christmas present and therefore have no opinion until I watch it. It took a while to turn up.
0446580848|5.0|I've read all of DeMille's novels.  I thought the \\"poorest\\" was the one titled \\"The Talbott Legacy\\" (I might have the title somewhat incorrect) and that one was VERY GOOD.  All the rest were better than VERY GOOD.  THE PANTHER, his latest, is terrific.  The John Corey character has appeared in his last few novels but all of them, from the very first,  are a joy to read.  Also they are solidly researched-you'll learn as much about Vietnam from UP COUNTRY\\" as from many non-fiction books about the Vietnam war and Vietnam now.  There is a reason he is one of America's top novelists-and it's simply because he is terrific.  If you've never read him-start now-with this or any of his books.  You'll never regret it.  (I started with BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON while I was laid up recovering from surgery). THE PANTHER is right up there-you'll find it very hard to put down.
B0079M8R6Q|3.0|My daughter has not read this yet, nor have I. Not much else I can usefully add. Price was good.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|I think this movie is very good.  Jim Carrey does a wonderful job in this movie and I think the fake world in this movie is very well though out.  Wonderful ideas presented in this movie
B003SNJYSK|3.0|It is still on my KIndle and I am yet to finish it. I am not disappointed with the purchase, but am having difficulty getting into it. It is getting better.
B0087IT8FK|4.0|This was a good movie that showed the compassion for a man who is disabled.  The fact that you had to read subtitles was really not my kind of movie, but it was enjoyable to watch.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|Canteen and cooking cup look durable enough but the cover/case is lacking.<br />1) the strap going over one side instead of both is not secure enough using Velcro. And Velcro is not the solution to everything as many companies seem to think. What's wrong with snaps over left and right sides?<br />2) belt loop is placed toward top of case so it is going to flop around when walking.  I have decided to secure it to my pack instead.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Works like a dream and i use it for gaming and emails, i like it! feels good in my hand and windows 7 picked it up instantly without any hiccups.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Wonderful Irish misfits who oddly enough fit into their surroundings.  The characters are memorable and their lives admirable. I enjoyed it a lot as I leave on a trip to Ireland meself!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|In my opinion the best Iron Man film ever! It's so much fun to watch.It's funny, action packed, emotional, full of love and shocking twists and turns.Which really keeps the film in a standing direction and not boring.It really makes you think what's gonna happened next.Keeps you on the edge of your seat.I love how through the film it shows Tony as not being the savior the whole time and having very human reactions.The twist with the Mandarin and Killian now that was funny.Love how Tony is determined to pull through for love and how she keeps him grounded.Pepper is incredible in this.Just such an awesome cast and story-line.Everything Perfect :)Can't wait to get this Blu-ray/ dvd set
B000I8HIV8|5.0|My five- year- old loved it.  Special effects are excellent.  An older movie, however it is still hilarious and kid friendly.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Fast, easy forecast information. This app has good features for different outlooks. I have enjoyed using it thus far. Recommended.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great acting by Pi. Felt it was real!! I would recommend it to everyone. I felt I was on this adventure with them.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|What took them so long to come out with another album?  There were a couple of tunes that were o.k. but most of them were classic Deep Purple.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Showed this film for our senior citizen group at church. It got rave reviews from everyone.  Great buy, great service.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think they could have done better by meaning of gems and how the time lapse is set for each activity but other than those few concerns it is a good app. I can imagine how many kids play with it because of the plot, and I think this is a good app for your kids or for yourself. An interesting and fun time consumer.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|You need to get this game you will love it me and my friends play it all the time the show is cool and the game is cool
1616551151|5.0|I loved this book. It covers a little bit of everything from races and countries to magic and beasts. Yes, most of it is things you could already know from the games and comics but it's nice to have it all laid out for you here. Most if not all of the art is from other products and is very well compiled in this book. I can't wait for the next one with more detailed information.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This was a great book that leaves me wanting more. You really get attached to the characters and figure out mysteries. Also you chooses who you want to win and who America should be with. I love this book!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Wow, does this game have PERSONALITY.  I'd give it 5 stars on presentation alone, but it's also a nice little showcase of gameplay design.  The puzzles are fun, and all &quot;tutorials&quot; are managed through organic play and/or great wordless guidance--even more elegantly than in Cut the Rope, Zepto's other great mobile game.  The hardcore puzzler in me would love something a little more extensive in terms of variety, length, and difficulty (maybe in a sequel!), but this is well worth your dollar.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I really enjoyed the book basically because the boys perspective as an autistic child is so different. It's eye opening, funny and gives the reader insight into the world of autism. Understanding is the first step to acceptance, great read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are looking for some quality entertainment without trashy scenes and vulgar language this is it!!!  Great story line and beautiful costumes.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Misremembered Man took a while to catch my attention and I had to get over the Irish slang but it eventually interested me because the two main characters are very different than any others I have come across.  I found the early years of Jamie's life (flashbacks) somewhat difficult to read because I think the deplorable conditions in the orphanage, while very loosely based on truth, were a bit overdone. Lydia's early years didn't make a lot of sense if she was truly loved by her parents as the book tries to portray in the end.  The book wasn't awful, I just can't think of a good reason to recommend it...
B000B589JI|5.0|This is a very, very useful and convenient little gadget. It is safe to travel with no leaks. I can be rest assured I will always have a light source if in an emergency. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|This is probably his best album thus far!!  Love it!!! Inspirational, peaceful, tranquil, and just plain excellent!  Every single song on this album!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This Facebook app is pretty cool. Glad I have it & find it convenient whilst on the go.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|wow is all i can say...from start to finish this is an epic recording. this is a true classic by a now classic band
B000W967UQ|4.0|Love the whole idea of a personification of Death as a major character, recurring in most discworld novels and liked this closeup view of Death's private life. However, lead character Mort was a little vague, his quest a little stupid, and resolution a little ex machina but that means that I only liked it very much instead of loved it, like most Discworld books.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw this movie first through Redbox and just a week or so later saw it on sale through Amazon.  It's an incredible movie, and I personally love Digital Copy, so that I can further my role as a digital hoarder.  Blu-ray graphics are also great and enjoyable.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I've been playing for two days now and it is completely living up to my expectations. There are still some small things that may need to be adjusted but I'm sure they will come in future updates.<br /><br />SINGLEPLAYER~ Epic...enough said, storyline is amazing. Has some very difficult challenges and exciting battles. Sometimes it is hard to level up though, and items have high buying prices and very low selling prices.<br /><br />MULTIPLAYER~ Its good, so far haven't found any bugs or glitches. Not very many people online though.<br /><br />Altogether its a great game and I would reccomend it to anyone.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I encourage all females to read this book, whether you're 18 or 58 and still writing your career path in life.  It is an easy read with humor and not full of sale pitches like some business-help books.  My book is full of pencil notes and lines around paragraphs.  I received the book as s gift and bought the ebook to keep on my phone when I have free time.  Worth it...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just what I have on home pc, good to play. The only thing annoying is the pop ups in between games.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Great 'trip hop' tunes with old school vibe.  Soulful artist who always puts me in an awesome mood.  If you love Badu, you won't be disappointed with these tracks.  Definitely one of my favorites!
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Bought for my sond birthday, he loves martial arts.  Loves watching the karate kid and little sis does too.  Excited to get for his birthday.
B00B19DW0E|4.0|Full of over the top action and dialogue. The type of mindless fun that helps pass time but doesn't waste it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|My kids are watching it as I am writing this review.  I have not seen this movie but my kids love it.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The author must have had walls in several rooms papered with notes to keep the enjoyable complicated plot lines in good order. While at times a tad predictable, we are soon back to an adventure accompanied by interesting friends. Read at your leisure and enjoy this book.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is the story of two adolescents both who have, or who have had, life threatening cancers.  The plot isn't major, but is just a spine around which the sensibility of the novel wraps itself.  And it's that they go to Amsterdam to visit the author of a book that has inspired both of them, and are disappointed in the author.  There are plot reversals (I won't be a spoiler!) and I found the characters and their relationship moving.  It's a quick and engaging read.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Pretty good movie but not great.  Based on the previews I thought it was going to be a different type of movie.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Lucidly written, a page-turner, compelling!  Christina Baker Kline brings us into a set of experiences we didn't know existed, and movingly so.  A lovely read.  And not just a &#34;summer&#34; read, but an anytime read.
0143039431|5.0|The plot depicts what many suffered in the Dust Bowl era, which makes it all the more poignant and heartfelt. Character development is steady and makes them stick with you. It may be dull for readers who enjoy action, though.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|Great movie and fabulous soundtrack, what more could you want? So glad I bought this! I will watch it again and again.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book sucks... you can not go from word to word. That is very dumb. Just saying home slice l.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Pretty sorry I sat through this, as it was pretty dumb. It was, for the most part, a waste of time,
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I was having a really great time with this game and I played it today and the controls are opposite! If I tilt it right it goes left, and if I tilt it left it tilts right. I cannot play like this. please fix!
B001JU6CGG|5.0|Loved the first one and this second one was every bit as good. Not usual for a series! Love, love, love these movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I chose this rating because I love he game or rocks. I would recommend this app to anyone who loves o build stuff you will have to fight creepers zombies a Skelton who can shoot arrows  and a spider it's really to play
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I rented this for my granddaughter and she loved it. It was true Disney entertainment. It was such a cute show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it. You have fun quests and you can work to get better and faster after playing it. There are also fun places to run like Rio, Rome,or Japan. It is always different and inteseting
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I liked it better than I expected to, after seeing the trailers for the movie. It's not a kid's story
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I was a big fan of Bowie in the 70s but then didn't find much to interest me in his post-\\"Let's Dance\\" material.  So it is with great pleasure that I took a chance on his new album and found it to be a very enjoyable collection of songs, offering a modern musical style that I think might appeal both to fans of Bowie's early days as well as those who liked him in the late 80s and 90s. Most importantly, this is an album that offers good material throughout, not just a few \\"hits\\" padded with filler. The album doesn't really start kicking into gear until the middle section (not to say the beginning tracks are bad, but they are just a warm up.) I also think that the couple of songs that were used to promote the album just before its release are far from the best on the album, but perhaps they will grow on me.  So if you are using those to judge whether or not you will like it, I don't think they are representative of the real pleasures to be found here for Bowie fans.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Tried this last night after I downloaded it.  The app works wonderfully!  You can transfer the information to other apps like evernote.  Would recommend if you like to take notes for class or at church.  Easy to use and organize.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|That might not sound very exciting but when you're stranded on Mars and everything you do is life or death, you need handyman skills on steroids. Andy Weir puts a smarter MacGuyver on Mars and tests his survival skills.
B006LSZECO|5.0|there are a lot of plot twist in this book.Which keeps the reader hooked. This was a great book.I will definately read more by this author.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|Great movie... Great insight into the workings of a cold war police state.  More than a machine, it is made up of people, with all their quirks.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Probably the best marvel game on the kindle fire. Graphics are cool and the gameplay is pretty fast paced. The only BAD thing is the waiting!! What can you expect from Gameloft? Other than that solid game and very addicting!!!
B00BZODDYU|4.0|I wasn't expecting any of what took place..it was a great watch with a surprising ending that usually is not the outcome
B00B671W6W|2.0|as great as 'Worship' was, this is just horrible.  it sounds like a 52 years old drunk white guy singing karaoke.  like most tribute / cover albums get this if you're a die hard fan of the band, listen to it once or twice and then never play it again.  do yourself a favor and get the originals instead.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Lots of fun to play. A lot of the songs are very hard to play, If you don't really know the song. Happy Birthday is the easiest one...
B004J64QSI|5.0|I'm no fan of musicals but by God this was amazing! Amazing story. And those voices... unreal! So glad my wife suggested we watched it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Please hurry up & release #6 & 7!! Ready to see who wins this game of tricks, deceit and thrones!
B007TML4EI|5.0|In this app, you are trying to help a crash test dummy survive terrible fates by building structures to keep him safe. It's like anti-angry birds where you are building to protect, not flinging to break down. The less the materials you use, the better your score. Addicting and fun. Love it
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Easy to use.  Has timer, alarm clock and stop watch modes.  You can quickly do anything that one uses a timer for.  Several ways to specify time makes it fast and useful from everything from games to food timing.  Use preset times or specify your own.  Accurate.  Used on my Droid Razr.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|My only complaint is that you run out of credits too fast.  I wish you could buy more with your bingo money.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Using Jump Desktop from a Droid Razr.<br />I have tried many of the Android remote desktop applications.  Most do not work very well.  Small screens are hard to use when connected to computers that normally display on large screens.<br /><br />Jump Desktop is great.  Here is why:<br />* Works with Network Level Authorization (NLA)<br />* Fast (I like having things responsive)<br />* Once connected works readily and the operation is very smooth.<br />* Very intuitive.<br />* I love the big circle for clicking (or you can click on the screen w/o the circle).  Makes a much better target when working with a small screen.<br />* Gestures are easy to use and work smoothly.<br />* Connects very quickly.  I often switch rapidly between various computers.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* No password or other interlock to prevent others from using your saved connections.<br />* Did not work with my LAN's DNS server to decipher local computer names<br />* Froze when Wi-Fi was not on and I was trying to connect to a local computer<br />* I do not think that the application handles multi-screen monitors.<br /><br />I use my cell phone to get to regular desktop computers to handle problems - when I don't have access to a more suitably sized device to work with.  Jump Desktop does a great job meeting this need.  With Jump Desktop I am always in reach of my desktop resources.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson delivers again with another amazing book. If you were a fan of his Mistborn books, you should not miss out on this one! Brandon's writing has matured, and with it comes a bevy of new characters to cherish.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|Basically, nothing new to offer, the same effects as everyone else. I can only speak for myself, but I did not find it particularly easy to use. So for me, there was no draw!
B003R0MEZ4|4.0|it was great and i would buy more from this selection just as good as the rest of the disk
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Initially I thought I would not care for a corrupt law enforcement based series but... there are so many twists and turns, so many different characters, each with his/her demons that I  think this is one of the best series made. The &#34;Law and Orders&#34; are predictable. This is edge of your seat, can't wait to see the next episode adult drama.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|A very imaginative and intriguing read.  It seemed choppy at a couple points, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, but overall a pretty fascinating plot and slew of characters.  Probably will read it again at some point.  Well worth the money.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|No issues with packaging or delivery. Product came early. Love this movie. Funny, funny funny. Clint is typical but Burt is great!
B00BIPCY14|5.0|This was a great show. I personally never thought about watching it when it first came out but I'm impressed with how it's kept me interested. I recommend this show to anyone
0812973992|5.0|this book was well written, different style than i had read before, however, i enjoyed it immensely.  i look forward to more writing my mccann.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|My five year loves this movie. Has him hooked from beginning to end. Cute story about raising a kid as a single parent.
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|Not too many words but WOW, these two are like bread and butter.. unreal chemistry and it seems we have the old Mr Harper back! Charlie's done nothing but made him back into the person he was.. helped him lose the ego. Just saw em live in DC, unreal.. my 7th Harper show and this one was THE BEST!!<br />Tracks are all wonderful, from heavy hittin blues, to more ballad like &#34;sad songs&#34;
B000AY74OG|5.0|Good humor for my little ones. Does not have crazy humor that most kids movies have. My boys laugh thru most of it. Not a bad movie to sit thru either as a parent.
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|Yes, this is a video-game movie. Yes, it's a kids' video-game movie. Yes, an appreciative knowledge of games from  Qbert to Halo will be helpful in picking up the in jokes. But hearing our villain/hero Ralph quietly whispering, &#34;I am bad and that's good, I will never be good and that's not bad, there's no one I would rather be than me&#34; while hurtling toward what he has every reason to believe is his doom to save a friend--that's a moment that goes way beyond video games. I watched this one for the jokes and the fun animation, but I remember it because that moment of conscious, altruistic charity is just about perfect.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|This is a good show with some serious plot lines.  The only thing I don't care for are the steamy scenes.  They're not necessary.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|The accents are a bit difficult at times. (At the end, the real characters talk and they are much easier to understand). The story is loosely bassed on a true event. It is great to watch the ladies take on Ford Motor Company. The cast is excellent. One can watch the video multiple times and enjoy the subtlies you missed on a previous viewing.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is well acted, has beautiful scenery, and an amazing plot line.  Although I don't like sci-fi movies, this is one that is actually (and unfortunately) plausible,
0345529057|4.0|The quality of the books leave something to be desired - then again at this price point I shouldn't be complaining.  I think I probably paid about the same amount for this set and the hard cover. Way better than the TV show (which is pretty damn good).  Look forward to winds of winter.  In the meantime I'll keep myself busy with Keystones: Altered Destinies.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Love this show! My husband and I LOVE this show, we cannot get enough. It' hard to wait until the next episode to find out what's going to happen next.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Another excellent aircraft fighter game. Good controls with an option for an uncoupled rudder for more realism. Only wish the mission times were longer. Can't wait to see what this team puts out next!
B00BF123WG|4.0|Interesting take on the elimination of bin Laden. Don't know how true to life it was, but the story line held my attention, and the final scenes had plenty of action.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|One of the things that Marvel has done so well with their series of movies has been to keep the characters true to their comic book origins. I say Marvel in the sense of the movies that Marvel has done, not in the sense of all of their characters (because, if you look at what Sony did to Wolverine and will be doing to him again this summer, you will find that non-Marvel companies have not handled the characters quite so faithfully). With that in mind, I was looking very forward to the Mandarin as the villain in Iron Man Three.<br /><br />The Mandarin, for all intents and purposes, is Iron Man's nemesis. He pre-dates the Iron Man comic book just as Iron Man does [Iron Man made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39, the Mandarin in issue #50], so I was expecting something... well, I was expecting something epic. Iron Man's greatest foe and all of that. That is not even close to what Marvel delivered with this movie, and I can't say more than that without offering spoilers. Let's just say that I was... disappointed with the Mandarin, especially given that it was Ben Kingsley. Not that Kingsley didn't do a great job; he did. I mean, he was fantastic in the role that they wrote for him; it just wasn't the role I wanted to see him in.<br /><br />Here's the thing, for most of you out there, the vast most of you, the most of you that didn't spend more than a decade reading Iron Man comic books, there will be no issue with the role of the Mandarin at all. See, it works great in the movie. Which is what causes my divergence of opinion. On the one hand, I'm disappointed with the portrayal of the Mandarin, but, on the other, Iron Man Three was completely enjoyable to watch and has a lot going for it. In my head, I know that the continuity that the Marvel movies is setting up is not the same as it is in the comics, but that doesn't change my emotional reaction to it. The &#34;why did they change that?&#34; reaction.<br /><br />Of course, it's comic books, and, maybe, they didn't change anything. It is conceivable that the Mandarin will still become who and what he is in a later movie. Or, maybe, he's that, now, but they're just hiding it.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it was quite good. Robert Downey, Jr. was amazing as always. It's a more personal movie than the previous two in a lot of ways. Tony is dealing with... issues, mostly brought on by his experiences in New York during the alien invasion in The Avengers. For much of the movie, he's effectively alone without any armor, and it was interesting to see Tony operating as a person rather than an iron man. Downey pulled that off with what appeared to be effortless ease.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle were respectable in their roles. Even Guy Pearce was adequate. Okay, probably more than adequate, but I really don't like the guy, so, when he plays a villain, he gets an automatic boost from me in that regard, so I actually have a difficult time in telling whether he's doing a good job or not, because I'm not going to like him anyway. I'll know that he can actually act if he ever bothers to play a good guy and he can make me like him. And, as I stated, Ben Kingsley was amazing. He really was.<br /><br />Iron Man Three is slightly different in structure than the other two. It starts with an opening narration, and I don't tend to be fond of narration in movies. Of course, it ties in with the way the movie ends, which almost makes it worth it, but not quite. It also starts and, then, jumps back, which I'm also not fond of, but, at least, it didn't do a &#34;three days earlier&#34; or anything like that.<br /><br />Also, the CGI is a bit... clunky... in this one. I didn't know why until I got home and looked it up: ILM did not do the effects on this one. Now, that is something I completely don't understand. ILM did the effects for both other Iron Man movies and The Avengers, so why switch when Disney owns ILM, now? If it was that they were too busy with the new Star Wars, I could understand, but they have at least half a dozen films coming out this year that they're doing the effects for, so having someone else do this Iron Man seems odd to me. Oh, well, I'm sure it was cheaper. It's always about the money, right?<br /><br />So, yeah, as a movie, I liked it. It's great, in fact. But that doesn't stop me from being ambivalent.
0374533571|5.0|This book should be read by everyone who wants to learn about mental illnesses.  It is hard  on all who live with a loved one with bipolor especially. It is very possible to help a person with these illnesses when you can understand them. There Is always hope for a better tommorow and the book proves just that. It also show's how important support from family and friends  is, for mental ill people. The book has humor, hope and health advice. Great book.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The reason for the 4stars is the movie can be slow at times. But it is well done and tells an intriguing tale of a 10 year long manhunt. Its filmed in a semi-documentary format which while it slows the story down it does give it a more realistic feel.  I would recommend the movie to anyone interested in 9/11, the resulting war, and the hunt for Osama.
B008BM9L72|5.0|There was only one reason to put this down. Not a book to be read in public. Next book please.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is the book I have been waiting for.  A real ending to a rich, epic series.  Robert Jordan would be pleased.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Good story, kept me reading late into the night. I will be looking for the next book in the series.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Needed a replacement controller, this is perfect, works great.  White is a good color too.  The cord is extra long and I prefer that over a wireless controller that requires batteries.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My only complaint is that I have to wait for season 4. I could sit and watch Downton Abby for hours.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I like Judy Dench and this is a good movie. Different than some she has made, but I liked it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love it!  The characters are self-deprecating enough that it turns the show into a fun ride.  Crowley's a fun little devil too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It has been so easy to download library books and enjoy reading them! Will use it again and again! A great app for Androids!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this app is so cool it helps me with school work and wakes me up too get it now for you
B00A14SQBU|4.0|But it's not all just regurgitated songs from previous albums, either. For Christina Aguilera fans, it's a nice addition to your collection. If you're new to Christina after seeing her on &#34;The Voice,&#34; it's not the worst way to familiarize yourself with her music. There are a couple of entries with mildly raunchy lyrics, but nothing that I personally found offensive or too explicit.
B000GCFBQU|3.0|The main character, a grieving widower/minister, spends his days after his wife's death repressing his emotions and neglecting, to a point of abuse, his 6 year old daughter Katherine.  He turns to no one for solace, but immerses himself in the homilies of sermons and loses himself in meditation of his idol, Bonhoeffer, while not understanding, or even noticing, the need for intimacy with human beings - with individuals in his congregation.<br />Unfurtunately, throughout the book, the repetitive focus on his fanatical relationship with Bonhoeffer, sermonizing, and homily-speak, to exclusion of imtimacy in the human world is so dominant that it becomes painful and boring to read.  I think I continued to read just to see how Strout would manage to get Katherine out alive and how she would create a wake-up moment for the minister at the end.  Yes, she did manage; but hey!<br />This book isn't simple.  It raises many moral issues: end-of-life assistance, tolerance and bigotry.  But I think it is weak as a novel.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|It's got a good beat, and you can dance to it. :)  Some of the lyrics actually have some depth or tell a story, so it's not all bubble-gum pop. They have nice, clear voices. Overall, it's an enjoyable album that you'll listen to repeatedly.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Total waste of time. This is probably the most horrid and pointless books I have ever wasted my time readingg.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I could never keep track of all the HP DVDs I had and to whom I had loaned them. This is a handy set to keep for myself because it has all of titles together on one easy place.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed everything about this book. The story, the writing,everything. Chose it on a whim and am very glad that I did. Thank you!
B009AMANH4|5.0|What a great movie.  Well worth the money.  Absolutely superior rendition of a legendary time in American history, and done very well.  Thank you.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|It is a good game but I just hate it that the game has to verify files when I open it, after 5 minutes of verification it tells me I don't have enough space. If there isn't enough space it shouldn't charge the user and install to the device
0316228532|3.0|I have mixed feelings about The Casual Vacancy. I didn't really get into the novel until almost halfway through. That's about how long it took me to get a firm grasp on all the characters and their relationships. That said, I did become more engrossed once this occurred because it is imperative to understand who all the characters are to fully enjoy the story. It was a struggle to get to this point, however, because the beginning moved so slowly that I had to force myself to continue reading, hoping that eventually things would pick up. And they do, but you just have to get through the strain of the beginning, something many people may not want to do. Overall, the book was OK for me. The beginning was quite a struggle, but by the end, I enjoyed my time with the citizens of Pagford.
B0090SI44M|5.0|kids and adults had great time together, and the video is &#34;little impressionable mind&#34; safe, no profanity. nice to have a product that is fun, entertaining, and does not require an after the fact explanation of unwarranted scenes or language.  Well done for family of all ages.
1400069807|5.0|This book is well worth the read.  Never able to look at a grocery store the same again.  Something needs to change.
B004XQYBA2|1.0|very disappointed in this one - advertised for kindle, but no mention that it will not work on fire.  So, if you like stuff for a &#34;two generations old&#34; device, go for it.  if you want something you can use today, pass on this baby!
B007KGXY0K|5.0|Built to do chess computations using Houdini 3 Pro, and it 3x faster than my i7-2600K based machine.<br /><br />I do not understand why the other reviewer made such a big deal about SMBus, but I can understand why his build may not work correctly (wrong memory, probably also did not build RAID correctly for > 2 TB disks).<br /><br />For Win8 one needs to update drivers, the link provided by the person commenting (trying to help) on the other review is very helpful, cheers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow all I can say. Its a great book must read the first one to understand the second one. I can't wait until I read the third book.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The app is fun to play with but it won't save anywhere no matter where I choose. Kind of worthless.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm just an 11 year-old kid and I like it I'm dork glad I download it I just got lucky I'm too happy about it I'm just a shy girl like her
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think this is a really fun game. I literally spend hours playing it. It's entertaining and the animation and the color is great I highly recommend this game.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Great game kinda like zombie highway keep it comin Glu mobile games thank you  no bugs also which is great for all of those gamers out there
B009P5K4HK|4.0|Disc one I give a 3.  The songs were mostly from \\"Frank\\", the two old classic jazz songs were a 5, but the rendition of Love is a Losing Game, my favorite Amy song ever was ruined by the piano players horrible interpretation that sounds more like pounding on the keys.  It completely ruins the flow of the song.<br /><br />On the other hand disc 2, the video interview and her trip to perform at the church in Dingle is excellent.  That I give a 5 star rating.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|A classic that represents th  ills of society. A lost generation with a lost purpose.... most depressing books I've ever read.
B001NS5NSC|5.0|I had forgotten about this album. It is one of the all time best. Brings back nice memories for me.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Considering that this series was intended for color screens about 12&#34; diagonal, to see the attention to detail it up close on a computer screen speaks to the pride that those who worked on the show, especially the sets, had in their work.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's handy to have this available where ever I might be.  It's particularly handy when shopping.  I can figure the sale price when they say 20% off!!
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|While the premise of this show is highly unlikely, if you can suspend your \\"this could never really happen\\" mind and just go with it, it's well worth the watch! The Following is a fast-moving thriller with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's well written and well acted and the characters are multidimensional. If you're into psychological thrillers, this is a great bet for you!
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Very good book! Love Lisa Gardner and this series. Full of suspense. It is a real page turner. I can't wait to read the next in the series.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|To many postings not wanted, such as political and unwanted advertising. Also some unwanted language and adult sayings. It needs to be cleaned up from garbage.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|So I have only used it a few days. The control and smoothness is very nicely done. Just about no lag, response on point. The only thing that I ran into so far, and may not even be related to app is while connected I could not start a VPN connection. However if VPN already connected before I connected with APP, it worked great. With that said I did get as part of the amazon daily free app.. At this point not sure if worth the $9.99
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|The grandkids love this movie so I. Purchased it for them and their mom. I cant wait to watch it again
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Never knew people were treated as such and nicknames.  This is a terrible example even in those days of human character.  Actors did a great job.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie. I really enjoyed the interaction of the characters. It was entertaining all the way through, would definitely recommend.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Its nice to see that people regardless of there terrible experience are willing to go to lengths to help some one after such a terrible disaster.  She could have died just from no care given timely.  Also the bond families have with each other and strength that comes forward.
0062068415|1.0|Well this book caught me totally by surprise.  I have read all of Lehane's novels chronologically and was sufficiently entertained in the process.  I heard that the movie \\"Shutter Island\\" was really good so when I curled up to read the book I was very excited.  Then a weird thing happened.  The book started out dull and just never got interesting the more I progressed.  It wasn't until chapter 17 that there was some excitement happening, but by then it was too little too late as the story climaxed into a predictable ending.  The whole book just seemed too disjointed.  The plot was weak but it could still have been a good read if the writing was interesting, but it wasn't, so I rate this book as a flop because it just doesn't have any redeeming qualities.  I wasn't expecting to be disappointed like this by Lehane and I'm sure The Given Day will be much better.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Reminds me of playing magic the gathering. I do think that eventually the game does test your patience but other then that it's very nice.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|His story's take me to another place far away.  And Kurt is such a thoughtful, tortured soul.  Loved the title too.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting view of the future, scary actually. Worth reading. Juliette was a great heroine, but I wish there was more romance, and a lot was left unanswered with George.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I just love zeptolab they've done it again. I think the graphics are spectacular and the levels are just really fun. I highly suggest this app. It is worth the ninety-nine cents.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Seen this movie a long time ago.  Liked it then and still enjoyed it this time around. The storyline is not that far from the truth.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is very fun and entertaining. The only bad thing is, it never saves my progress. I always have to start over every time I play the game again. But that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, other than that I give it 5 stars.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Exceptional show, gritty action, dark frozen north inhabited by mad killer Vikings...Loved it!!!<br />Nice acting, liked Floki the best...<br />Worth the money.
B009O36EO0|5.0|Loreen showcases her fantastic Eurovision and songstress talents in this great album. You can tell, she's lived a life and she's got the pipes. This one is on repeat.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I have not had it very long but so far, so good.  It was very speedy in getting here.  I know the longer I have and use it I will like it even better.
B0078XHAB4|3.0|A sweet Celtic tale that melds the real world with that of a departed soul. Unusual, mystic but very readable.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|It works great for me.  I use it to pass time when I don't have WiFi. I haven't tried playing online yet.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I bought this with the 16GB corsair RAM, 64GB Crucial M4 SSD and it hasn't disappointed.  It is my demo machine for my travels all across the world.  And it fits in my backpack.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My wife and I watched all 3 seasons in about 2 weeks.  Really good show as long as you can stomach the gore.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game so funny got cool games like survival z and Romeo's plan serpant sky diver sharp shooter
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it!!!!! there are so many games to chose from. lots of fun!!! I would recommend this game to everyone!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Omg this game is sooo awesome. even tho it took up a lot of space....it was worth it :) download it NOW you won't. regret it
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Think it was better on the big screen. It had more impact that way.  I would probably rent it again.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|This is not useful at all - does not name streets and some major cities seen' t listed. A complete waste of money.
B00932A4XE|3.0|It wasn't anything exciting.  Just the same B movie except with well known stars. Something I would see on a Saturday afternoon on Hallmark.
0399160450|5.0|My second Tom Clancy book and this one was wonderful. Should be a movie! Read it in about a week, hard to put down. Cuts true to the present.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|It was really a good movie.  I even watched it twice.  The fact that it was a true story made it even better.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The very best Blu-Ray concert I have ever seen loved it so much after watching the one my husband purchased I bought one as a gift for my son and he loved it too. I have had the pleasure to sharing it with several others and everyone has raved how good it is, it was fun to see their faces.I look forward to watching it over and over again for years to come.
B008Y7DGXE|5.0|Not only one of Kevin smith flag ship movies but probably his best cant wait for clerks 3 woo woot
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I like how you don't need Internet connection.its a game that you can set a goal for yourself on.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|A must see. You must see it. Really, its a must see. I saw it and I really enjoyed it, so that means its a must see.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|Visually pretty, for sure, but what a lame story.  I just don't agree that this story is worthy of 5 stars.  Really?  5 stars?  How?  Two freaking shipwrecks in one movie, a meercat island, a zebra, hyena and monkey on a boat, not to mention a tiger?  I just don't get it, won't recommend it, and certainly will never waste my time watching it again.  Once again, two stars only, and I mean only, because it was visualy appealing.  But the plot and movie stunk.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I loved the series.  I loved reading Robert Jordan's Books and thank you Brandon Sanderson for completing the series for him.  I've been reading this series for the past 16 years and enjoyed every one of them.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I read the story after the tsunami left its mark in the heart of hundreds of people. Even though I knew the end before I watch the movie, I was deeply touched by every story of people interconnected with the main characters. It's wonderful to see how strong we can be, how small kind acts change one's life, and how we witness miracles every day.<br /><br />And the last but not the least, the very well done scenes, and a great performance of Naomi Watts. It's a movie that I would recommend.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I only read the whole book because it's my habit...I have known many PCT &#34;through&#34; hikers, and this one is not at all like them. Whiny, self absorbed.  Don't bother to read this one. I only gave it one star because there was nowhere to put zero stars.  Yech.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like the game, some of the medals I feel I'll never get because you can't play for hour ( a medal requirement) without having to spend money to buy lives!!!
B0053KWDES|5.0|I consider myself and audiophile.  I currently own the Audio Technica Ath-M50 and needed a little extra kick when I use them.  I got a Massive kick when I put them to use.  This little rectangle will shake your jaw and loosen ear wax.  I highly recommend it for anyone that has a good pair of head phone.  Note I have tried them with ear buds and they cannot handle the output.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|I learned a lot about Lindbergh and his wife Anne from this book. I also did not realize how wimpy<br />and dependant on public opinion FDR was.  However, this book had none of the virtues of the book about<br />Lyndon Johnston by Robert Caro, which I'd give 5 stars to.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I love the book because I'm in the spelling bee<br /><br />and because i just love it like i love my mother
0307591549|5.0|A must read......inspiring.  Will most likely read it again.<br />A thoughtful study on people who over-achieve and how they think differently.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game because I saw the movie and so I I thought there was a game for the tablet and it was so I got it. GO IRON MAN!!!!!!!!!!
B00000DG1R|5.0|I always did like duran duran for there classic rock that they play.All I have to say it's a great cd buy it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game stinks and it has very poor quality. The controls are terrible, it gives you viruses and the graphics  are pathetic. I would rate this game -100 stars, but they didn't have that available. I would suggest that anybody who reads this true and honest review should NOT get this game or share it to anybody else because it is a waste of time. In my personal opinion, this game should be shut down and taken away from the public. Whoever created this game, I am very disappointed and I am shocked that they would let such a failed game go through to the public. I again restate my opinion that this is the WORST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!! I do not mean to threaten, denounce or criticize anybody, but I am just giving my rightful opinion, and yours may be different than mine. I hope this review was helpful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game.  Takes patience and practice to master.  Do not let yourself get easily frustrated as it is not worth it.  Play laugh and enjoy!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I give it 4 stars not 5. First novel by Lee Child that I read. It was a relatively fast read......a real page-turner. Interesting weave of historical fiction and character study. A definite recommend for thriller fans.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|only thing possible is flying and shooting do not get it even if its free trust me I got it
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was awesome. I hope that a sequel is made soon! I heard Disney wasn't going to do another but I hope that's not tru!!!!!!!
0142000655|5.0|East of Eden is a literary masterpiece. It's is an modern epic myth, exploring good and evil through the lives of two families residing in northern California. These families, like all people, live in the shadow of original sin, \\"East of Eden\\". In subtle ways they recreated the ancient stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel in their own lives. They are faced with the eternal choice, of choosing good or choosing evil. It exposes that worst and best of humanity. And in the ends, it stands as a towering literary monument to the battle between good and evil, human free will, and our life here, East of Eden.
B000002GBJ|3.0|A pretty good demonstration of Rick Wakeman's skill in playing various keyboard instruments. An interesting musical interpretaion into the marital blisses of one of history's more notorious figures.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Originally, I was privy to a Comcast 'watchathon' for Game of Thrones where I had to watch the whole of the series in about 5 days. I was addicted from the first episode and that last line, 'The things I do for love' shove, heheh. That led me to grabbing both seasons on DVD here at Amazon, and also, the books here locally. They run quite parallel, so fans of one should become fans of the other interchangeably with little grousing. Each season is like watching a 10 hour movie, and it's HBO so all the violence, gore and sex is graphically shown. The 10 hours in each season have been roughly one book apiece; Season one mirroring A Game of Thrones, and season two is near A Clash of King's mimic. Season three, which is currently (May 2013) running on HBO and it has been a fantastic near copy of A Storm of Swords. I'll have to be buying that as well when it releases.<br /><br />The story, from George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, is full of palace intrigue, all in effort to win the game of thrones and place their king or themselves upon the Iron Throne. The settings are rich and full, HBO spared no expense, and the acting is of a quality equal or exceeding the characterizations. Peter Dinkledge even won an Emmy for his portrayal, and I'm sure there are more trophies and nominations in this series that I can't recall or will come as things progress. You'll fall in love with Daenerys, love to hate to love Tyrion, cry for Arys and Sansa, and loathe Joffrey and Cersei, and experience any number of emotions for the rest of these deep characters that will become old friends, and enemies.<br /><br />Gather your wits, for you'll need them, and some popcorn and the beverage of your choice and prepare to be extremely entertained.
0446547646|4.0|I loved this book three fourths of the way, The story was great the characters well built and great twists and turns, the ending how ever felt rushed, like the author got bored with the characters or if he simply was trying to get an ending as touching as the Notebook, It didn't work. Still a good read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who just graduated from college. Gender bias is so deeply inculcated that it is not likely to change in her lifetime so she needs to know how her actions will be perceived vs. how the same actions from a male are perceived. It only briefly addresses the 'mommy' issue. That is not what the book is about. It's more about how our own self image and behavior can sometimes sabotage us. Reading the book feels like you are just having a casual discussion with someone who has already been there. And she wants other women to join her. Thanks Sheryl.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|I really love this movie. A must see. ##I'm trying to find me that same catsuit, lol## Halle Berry was at her best in this move.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I have to say though, the trailers are misleading.  They make you think this is a darker, grittier post avengers film about Stark dealing with his mortality and so on.  In reality, the movie is a lot of fun, and may be the most humorous of the three.  It also is the most action packed, having three large action setpieces and many smaller moments in between.<br /><br />The portrayal of the Mandarin may be a put off for some, but I thought it was an enjoyable development to the plot.  The plot had some nice twists and turns and was engaging throughout, without any real lulls in the pacing.  The Extremis powered fights were entertaining, and I particularly enjoyed James Badge Dale as Eric Savin.  However, this is Starks movie through and through.  Tony spends the movie coming to terms with being a smaller piece in a much larger world, and he is learning that his past has consequences in the world and on those he cares about.  It is at times very introspective, and this is the heart of the movie. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job balancing humor and a bit of edge as Tony Stark, who is less smarmy then in previous installments, but rather an emotional mess.<br /><br />Returning and new cast members are all great.  I thought Don Cheadle's Rhodey had a better banter with Stark in this movie, and they seemed to be better friends then in Iron Man 2.  Gwenyth Paltrow's Pepper is given more to do in this film given that her relationship with Stark is more central to the plot, which is a nice improvement.  Guy Pierce is effective in his portrayal as a snarkey and cockey scientist, and Ben Kingsley...not much can be said without spoiling things, but suffice to say he delivers.<br /><br />It is not a perfect movie, with the humor occasionally falling flat and some occassional choppy editing.  The portrayal of the Mandarin may not be welcome to some, and the motivations of the villains are a bit hazy as we never really learn what the endgame is, but those are small complaints toan otherwise very enjoyable movie.  Go in ready to have some fun and some laughs, but also for a deeper look at the man behind the mask.  To me, the original Iron Man film is still undefeated, but 3 was no slouch, delivering an immensely enjoyable action packed ride with plenty of laughs in between.<br /><br />4 1/2 out of five.  (But I'll round up to five as the stars wont let me use halfs.)
B005HEPN06|5.0|This show indirectly explores cultural differences.  Acting and direction are excellent.  Education encapsulated in entertainment.  I recommend this show very highly.
B0016CS0IK|5.0|Words can't describe the haunting 80'sesq album. I wish that people made music like this more often. Especially We Own the Sky.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is the last of the Academy Award Winning films top make it to home video, but it was worth the wait for the bonus features.<br /><br />As I post this review there are already 242 (!) reviews here on Amazon, but I want to point out Amazon's methodology for listing reviews. Reviews of both theatrical versions and home video are grouped under all formats. Hence, the majority of the reviews posted before this one are of the film. I always suggest that readers sort by most recent when reading reviews. Also, all formats of home video (both DVD and BD) are grouped too.  This review is of the BD+DVD+Digital version.<br /><br />Obviously, with this many reviews already up about the film itself I don't need to repeat much of the info, except to say that it took me a while to get into the story since I knew nothing about the plot, just that it takes place just outside Philly - my city-, where it was filmed. There's music but it's not a musical. There are some funny moments (the diner scene is ALMOST as good as the one in \\"Five Easy Pieces\\") but it's not a comedy. And it takes a while to realize that it's about depression and bi-polar disorders. But once it starts the acting (especially Jennifer Lawrence - Academy Award winner!).<br /><br />The BD has a slew of bonus features - some excellent; a few are throwaways. First is a group of 18 \\"Deleted Scenes\\" (without commentary) which totals 26 minutes. Next comes the 28-minute featurette \\"The Movie That Became a Movement\\" - which starts out discussing  the mental health issues with the President of the American Psychiatric Assn and TV's Dr. Oz ( oddly, in his \\"hospital blues\\" like he just came from the operating room!), and then moves into discussion of the music, scripts and dance choreography. It's worth watching. Next is a 27-minute Q&A held at a screening which includes Director, Writer, Producer and - from the cast - Robert DiNiro (a rare such moment). The other three \\"bonuses are just \\"fluff\\": 1 ½ minutes of \\"dance rehearsal\\" footage, 56 seconds of actor Bradley Cooper trying to use a steadicam and - if you want to learned the dance that Cooper and Lawrence do at film's conclusion - there is a \\"learn to dance\\" lesson by the film's choreographer that runs 11 minutes.<br />Overall I enjoyed the film. I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"earsal\\" footage, 56 seconds of actor Bradley Cooper trying to use a steadicam and - if you want to learned the dance that Cooper and Lawrence do at film's conclusion - there is a \\"learn to dance\\" lesson by the film's choreographer that runs 11 minutes.<br />Overall I enjoyed the film.

B003VW54QO|5.0|Best western ever...good story, wonderfully acted, small doses of humor and even singing and Walter Brennan!<br />Doesn't get much better
B002QRWJA4|4.0|This piece is good in the department of acting and the voices are not bad. i have seen an opera version of this and must say that they have a better take on the music. But the acting of Butler is superb in this piece. Emmy has a good voice and acts also pretty good. Definitely this piece is worth seeing. But it is interesting to compare it with one of the opera versions.
B0044C5SCU|3.0|My wife likes the show and talks through most of it.  I find it rather predictable.  We can always bet on Walter riding in to save the day.  We can always bet on Olivia getting in a fire fight she will always win if she doesn't beat up the bad guy first.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|It's a terrific musical and I watched it for the third time. Actually I don't like musical usually but this one is really great. And the fact that the choreography is done by Bob Fosse does a lot for the dancing scenes. Definitely worth seeing at least once.
B0054JELS4|3.0|Reference: Order #: 002-2625531-1771400<br />Our purchase of NCIS season 1-8 occurred in June 2012 through this venue. Due to changes in our life we were not able to start viewing the collection until fall/winter. When we started to view Season 6 the following occurred: Disc 1 all episodes played fine. Disc 2 through 6 did not show image or sound. Needless to say we feel we have been taken. I am concerned that the remaining seasons are not of a high quality. We are most unsure of ordering successive season episodes through this venue again. We cannot assign a star as half of the product is good, part is not, and the remaining has not been viewed. From what I have read there seems to be no solution offered now. C & M Baker, Germantown MD
B00BSBUZPK|1.0|There is nothing new here. Literally every inch of footage I have seen before. Not worth the money if you have any other Eagles DVDs.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|When I had my motorola electrify it worked just fine, now that I have the electrify 2, if force closes after 10 seconds of having the app open. This is ridiculous
B003BW0CB6|5.0|another true &#34;Law and Order&#34; adventure for Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller.  Connelly will keep you guessing until the very end.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|Your Highness is a great movie and a comedy classic. It has a cast of excellent actors and is just brilliant. Give it a chance!
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|Why on earth would an app suvh ad this need access to a thumbnail of my running or recently run tasks? I'm sorry, with a permission like that I would give it 0 stars if I could.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app, I can check out my Facebook account where ever I am and  can get internet. Everyone should have it.

B006BG7RI0|5.0|My wife and I went to see this new master of this classic movie when it was released in theaters for one day last year.  This new master is crisp and sharp.  There is nothing as dramatic as crisp, new black and white.
0811806405|5.0|This book is a definite must have if you are looking to make design or refurbish a guitar.<br />One you will refer to again and again.
B00000251N|5.0|The music is beautiful.  You can just vision the seagull flying and dancing in the sky.  It is very relaxing, too.<br />And it's Neil Diamond !!!! What else can I say ????  He is super.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What is not to like?  Inspired by the HBO series, I chose to read the book.  While the TV series seems to follow it exactly, the book gives you a much sharper sense of the characters, as you get to better understand what theirs thoughts and intentions are.  I really like how each chapter has a main character, rather than the story as a whole.  There are so many quotable lines in here as well.  This is some of the most enjoyable reading I have had in a very long time.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it is written to suck you in, great story. Look forward to seeing the movie in august!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|&#34;Arrow&#34; does not. It's astonishingly good for a network (non-cable) adaptation of a comic book. Its &#34;flaws&#34; (deviations from the canon of &#34;Green Arrow&#34;) are small and forgivable, and the inventiveness of the series more than makes up for it. Highest possible recommendation.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Very handy for listening to my collection and makes buying music easy. I would recommend it to everyone in a second.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have this game on my iPhone, a tablet, and my kindle fire... I know I'm hooked!!! I love the graphics the dragons are beautifully created. Hats off to the creators the are a work of art. I give the game 5 stars because it works on my time I don't have to worry about things expiring. Team Lava this is a winner. I also play Castle Story, Bakery Story and Fashion Story. Good job!!
B0052YAKS6|5.0|Great CD, great DJ, great Songs, great shipping, great buy for any David Guetta fans! You can upload them onto your computer or your phone and have them with you anywhere you go and if you have friends like mine who are constantly borrowing your stuff and never returning it i recommend you do this first :-).
0439023513|5.0|perfect condition, rather cheap, and it was kinda cool that it was a library book too. i'm very happy with it
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Okay, I know this movie is Spielburg's take on Lincoln; there's bound to be some artistic liberties taken.  But it makes you think through what was going on back in early 1865. Because if Lincoln's politics weren't playing through the scene in 1865 as they did in this movie, someone was bound to be maneuvering in the background.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This is the second time that I have read this book and as the first time, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|For having been written by one of the most beautiful women in the world, this book shows how down to earth and real this australian model really is. Every single word written in this book makes you feel like there's always a second chance to be and make things better. She talks about her personal experiences and, even though those experiences would never in a million years happen to me, I feel warmed and identificated to every single one if them.  Every quote that appears in that book is so inspiring and I would recommend it to every woman, or man, who is feeling down or unhappy.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Has always been my all time favorite show and always will be!! I love Star Trek and this incarnation of it is truly wonderful!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Every student in America should watch this series.  The acting was amazing & facts were true to history.  A Must See.
B000SEI230|5.0|Just a wonderful book and to read. interesting and just love Nicholas Sparks. This author can keep your attention all through<br />his book
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is such a pleasure to read. Pure inspiration. This story expresses the zeitgeist of our time: we are here for a purpose. Thank you, Paulo Coelho for sharing this beautiful vision of Life with us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and I've never had a problem playing it. I play every day and the game has always been a success
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a great educational but fun app. However it can be costly. Cost of treasure chests (sand dollars and pearls) slows game in relationship to reward obtained. Some of the feeding requirements are absurd. Love the graphics.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Doesn't make sense, terrible story , violent, slow<br /><br />Didn't like, no good, could be good it is not, do not recommend
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book was so amazing. It's about a dystopian world where your sixteenth birthday brings an operation that makes you pretty. Tally Youngblood is 3 months away from her special day, and she can't wait. One night, she crosses paths with Shay, who is soon to become her best friend. The night before Shay and Tally's sixteenth birthday, Shay runs away. The next morning when Tally is ready for her operation, things go terribly wrong, and Tally is offered a choice: betray Shay or never become pretty at all. This choice brings Tally on a wild ride through love, hate, and the wonders of the wilderness, all to get into New Pretty Town, where all you have to do is have fun. When Tally finds Shay, her decision will change everything she ever knew about herself...
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've used this only within my local network for RDP access.  This works very well.  I'm surprised how easy it is to interact with Windows on my PC.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The most important and truthful message in the book (that I had never heard before) was that one of the most important professional decisions a woman can make is who she marries. Her spouse must be supportive of her career and help out 50/50 at home. Sounds so basic but I am afraid too often it doesn't occur.<br /><br />I wanted more depth and less repetition but what she gave in this book included background on feminism, reflections from important women from many ages/stages, and the beginnings of a discussion about where we are today and how to move forward with our work and our lives.
B00770KR7W|1.0|Broke in 5 min. Doesn't move right. looks nothing like the picture and paint comes off quickly. IF there was an option for 0 stars, I would have picked it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You cannot put this book down. Diabolical and unpredictable. That said, it was a little like eating a bag of potato chips --- you cannot stop but once you are finished you wished you hadn't started.<br /><br />It was a wild ride. Once it was finally over I was glad to get off.<br /><br />Hats off for an incredible story teller. Too dark for my tastes. Writing style/word choice a bit bland compared to others like Julian Barnes &#34;Sense of an Ending&#34;  but glad I read it to see what all the fuss was about.
B0096HL33G|3.0|The movie started out sad and never left that feeling behind. The male lead was a shallow self centered character and all the female lead wanted was her love returned.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Another good game from glu.  As other reviews have mentioned one you get to the higher levels it's hard to level up without spending money but the developers have to make money some how.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I looked forward to the long wait in the doctor's office just si I could read this. I can hardly wait to see what Juliette does next. She is like a very resourceful cat with nine lives. Keep up the good work  Mr. Howey.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Add my voice to the chorus of those who love this show.  Excellent characters and pitch-perfect acting make this series one of the best 23-episode arcs I've ever watched.  So, so much more than a simple procedural-legal drama of the week.
B009AP2G26|3.0|I truly enjoyed the first three seasons of Glee.  However, Season 4 has disappointed me.  The story line is not what I expect from Glee.  The music, as always, is great.  The acting is forced and the relationships among the kids in Glee do not seem realistic to me.  The last episode I watched on 5/2/2013 was a waste of time.  Singing Stevie Wonder songs was okay, but no real story behind it.  My expectation was that they would be practicing hard for Regionals, and I just did not see the drive and the wanting and needing to win.  I understand that Glee has been renewed for two more years, and I hope to see improvement from this year.  I am a true Glee fan and will continue to watch in hopes of seeing that spark and excitement that was there the first three years.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|For its time goldeneye was a great Bond movie. Pretty ladies, awesome scenes and a great twist. The video game face a great spark to first person shooters.
B00338QENI|5.0|Skloot's novel, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, will likely find an immortal life, as well.  It is amazingly written, with respect to the science involved, and the portraits of the main characters.  One cannot help but imagine Henrietta's suffering, and the subsequent suffering of the family that lost her.  It is incredible that her cells have lived on, and that some of the most significant of medical advances have resulted from the use of her cells.  It is also incredible that her family hasn't realized some compensation for this reality.  My heart broke for Henrietta's daughter and I couldn't help but wonder if she would have ultimately allowed Skloot to have published her book as written, had she not passed before she could read it.  In short, an amazing read--thought provoking and heart wrenching.  Recommend.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I need to buy this movie. I keep watching all the time. I have gotten my family to watch this and they enjoy it as too
0385344228|5.0|First off this is a well written engaging story.  That in itself would deserve a terrific review.  However any book that makes you think &#34;what would you do&#34; particularly as a parent raises the bar.  Great read overall.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I'd never heard about the Orphan Trains during the Depression.  Although it uses a fictionalized main character, it was based on real events.  The author does a wonderful job of giving us a character, Vivian, we care about and I was with her every step of the way on her journey.  Her modern day &#34;Orphan&#34;, Molly, lends a perspective to the challenges dealing with the same issues today.<br /><br />Her descriptions of places and characters are terrific. The scenes with Vivian and Molly at the end are just beautiful.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun and large enough tiles which Ilike. Great Color.<br />Much better than some other games I have. downloaded. I will comment more later.
1848378963|2.0|Reminded me of things I sloshed through in high school.  It had some interesting moments but I never doubted how it would end.  It was 200 pages tooooo long.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game. It is very fun and enjoyable. I would play this game all day if I could. :)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Slow at the beginning to set up writer's life.<br />Trying to describe something experienced mentally is difficult. It became a collection of &#34;felt&#34; images/feelings that didn't translate very well.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I watch this show for Purefoy and Bacon.  It can be quite disturbing but they have made Ryan and now Mike morally ambigious heros which is what the public likes.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this is a great game but one of its flaws is the prices of the suits because like some other people their parents wont pay money for an app so please make an update with cheaper prices on everything thank you have a nice day.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This movie was very moving for numerous reasons.  The relationship between the &#34;Richard Parker&#34; and the boy was incredible to take this story line and create survival for the both of them. Discovering the amazing things in our creation and the mysteries of God that could not be explained to help them survive all the perils of nature.  Touch every part of my emotions, and leaves you thinking about the fact that miracles still exist no matter how dreary and gloomy things appear to be if it is not your time, it is not and that means there is probably something bigger and better for your future.<br />Story was captivating from beginning to end. Highly recommend!!
B0091I7FEQ|5.0|It is nice having this with me everywhere I go.  It is a little weird not holding a hard copy but none-the-less, I love it.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Great watch from a functional standpoint.  Works great and keeps very accurate time.  Movement is good.  Quality appears solid just a very small profile.  Almost the size of a ladies watch.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game is fun, a little harder than the others, but once you get used to it it's cool. I have all the temple runs
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|This album is even better than George Harrison's \\"Cloud Nine.\\"  I'll probably have to buy it again just for the bonus tracks.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The trilogy was good, but it would have been a wonderful story line without all the sex. They had sex so much even they were tired of screwing.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|When I hear this song it makes me think of being at the skating rink and having fun, I love singing this song.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoyed this game and its addicting. Even my mother enjoyed it more than on her other hand held game. Like I said, addicting.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This game, which centers around a psychic detective who must solve a mystery when she comes to visit a friend in his town, is filled with lots of hidden object games that are clever and challenging.  There are a few puzzles thrown in for good measure, but the dialogue is a bit hokey.  It is fairly entertaining and kept me wanting to move on - not so much to solve the mystery because it was somewhat confusing and vague - but because it was kind of fun to find the hidden objects.  Some of the puzzles got dull - they were variations of each other, so you might have three puzzles in a row that were in the same setting with minor changes.  This is fun, but nothing special.
B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|I returned mine soon after I received it. There are 3 buttons where you're thumb rest, one towards the front, then the middle one and then the one towards the back where the knuckle of my thumb touches. I tried my best to like this mouse and see if I could put up with the 3 button being in the way but I could not. I would be playing a game and I would constantly press the 3rd back button on accident it was so irritating. I do not have big hands, I can only imagine how irritating it would be for someone with bigger hands. Maybe I am the only one that was bothered by it but I had to return it.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble can seemingly do no wrong with his newest album, To Be Loved. It is a stellar collection of originals and classic tunes. &#34;You Make Me Feel So Young&#34;, &#34;It's a Beautiful Day&#34;, and &#34;Something Stupid&#34; are some of my favorites, but it is especially difficult to pick top tunes on this album. Additionally, this album features guests like Reese Witherspoon and Bryan Adams making the songs distinct and enhancing Buble's beautiful voice. This may be my favorite of all of Buble's albums because it is the perfect balance of upbeat poppy-tunes and classic renditions of big-band tunes. This is a great album.
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|Bad directing, poor acting, and... poorly conceived plot and character development. Not worth your time, to much good entertainment out there and to little time. Don't waste a moment on this film.
B008JIFJ4W|2.0|Because I loved &#34;I Take a Walk&#34; after hearing it multiple times on the radio, I was excited to download the album.  After listening to it, however, I don't find that the mood of that single song is carried over with other songs on the album except with the possibility of &#34;Carried Away&#34;.  It is okay, but I wouldn't rush to download this.  Yes, the music is interesting and unique, but there isn't another tune on the album that is quite as catchy or addictive as &#34;I Take a Walk&#34; (&#34;Carried Away&#34; is catchy too, but has a different vibe).
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Excellent conception of a sociopath, his upbringing and relationships. Well acted and directed. Will stir some deep emotions except in the most callus. If you want a movie that moves you intellectually and emotionally, with a cold realism, this is it!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Get more shows like this? It's authentic to the times, it has intrigue and romance; war and peace. An engrossing insight into the time period.
B001A50716|2.0|This is one of my favorite films and was looking forward to seeing it again on DVD.  However, had to try 3 DVD players before one would accept it. This information was not made available when I purchased it.....why diid this happen???
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The easy flow between the characters is nothing short of genius.  Through hell and highwater, the boys, and girls, in blue get it done, along with one writer who inspires them as much as they inspire him.  It's impossible not to be drawn in by the dynamic characters and there is something for everyone: intense drama, comedy and romance.  Must See!

B0030DHPGQ|4.0|I recommend this book.  Its approach is somewhat different from every other theory out there about change management. Te examples presented in this book facilitate the understanding of the concepts explained.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very easy read. First-hand account of the life of a true American hero. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in military reading.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What a great story. I cried and laughed out loud.  The scene with the wig was just too funny.  I will probably read this again.

B007HJ96NO|5.0|This film will bring back the path that got you where you are, the people and places along the way that shored you up and gave your life some everyday poetry. Beautifully shot, Cinema Paradiso is a story told in images and moments by people you feel like you already know. One of the best.
B009CCBCU4|3.0|This is historical fiction and genre that I dearly love.  The one annoying thing is terms are used throughout the book that aren't in any dictionary I own.  Perhaps it would have been more enjoyable with a glossary of terms.  It is the first account of life in the peoples of Mexico and Central America that I have ever read.  I would have liked more detail in the day to day...but the author can only speculate as there is not as much material available as would be for the same time period in Europe.
1423140605|4.0|I'm not the target audience of middle schoolers, but this is a fun series, a fast read and very enjoyable. Love Riordan's references to legends, mythology, latin. The more you know, the more fun you get out of the series...

0307887448|3.0|Ready Player One targets a very specific audience.  An individual that would enjoy this book would fit into two categories: 1) excessive gamer 2) 80s pop culture enthusiast.<br />This combination would make an ideal reader for Ready Player One as numerous references are made to both gaming and the 80s.  Having a gaming background will definitely help bring a reader through.  But if readers don't hold these particular interests, they are in for a possibly lackluster read.<br />Not being a gamer or a child of the 80s myself, I was hoping that when I pulled the scope out a bit and looked at the broader scheme of things, maybe I would like the book perhaps thematically in its message, or thrilling in its plot.  Unfortunately I was not really impressed by any of the literary strings that Cline tried to pull.<br />Plot wise, there was a certain profundity in Cline's message.  It was clever of him to use dystopian themes and the way he paints the future of America is frightening.  While creating an alternative society in decline was an interesting way of presenting how our current habits and practices are not sustainable in the long run, Cline's writing style falls short of the complexity of his message.<br />For me, the overlying message while smart was not executed in an effective enough manner for me to enjoy the book.<br />Wade Watts, the protagonist has to overcome a series of hurdles before he reaches his end goal.  There are exactly six hurdles.  It is no surprise that he gets through all of them and of course gets the girl in the end.  The predictability of the plot, in my case, didn't really make for a page turning read, but rather a repetitive one.<br />I can see why Cline wanted to mimic the form of a game wherein Wade is the player and he has to get through many levels before attaining his objective, but sadly I found it tedious.  I don't know if it is just me, but if I wanted to play a game, I would want to play the game, not read the game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I caught the tail-end of season 3 and fell in love with this series. The writers were so good that I was able to lose myself in the lives of the characters, and felt sad when it ended. Although these are fictional characters, they became very real to me. I look forward to the next season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this book because I saw the first movie and then I just had to read the next two books! Suzanne Collins rocked it! The trilogy was awsome!
0141345659|5.0|Amazing story.  One of the best I've read in years.  It's sold as a young adult novel but all adults will tear through this book.  My husband loved it too!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I have loved this show for its duration but it's getting a bit old. The jokes are the same, the plots are the sames, the characters don't grow. I will watch to the last season which I hope is soon.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I had never watched this show before and started watching on Amazon prime and got hooked. Makes it even better that you can stream it for free.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the game....downloaded it for my granddaughter....I enjoy it also! some problems as far as me being able to interact with neighbors...but ...can deal with it!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It seems to me there is so much hype around new releases the film just doesn't live up to the build up. I found this to be the case here. It falls short.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Quick simple brought this movie and I back together after an elongated departure. It had been too long and we are stronger than ever... tear
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My son has had trouble sleeping, and we live in a somewhat noisy area with traffic and a bus stop practically right outside our door. Since we bought White Noise he sleeps like a baby! I highly recommend this app.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I watched the movie and then found out there was a book. Its a great read and will read again.
0394800192|5.0|Our second or third copy, this time for grandchildren.  It has a great rhythm to it, and charming illustrations.  Children love it.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This is a very nice upgrade, so nice it is my preferred around the house flashlight. GREAT light and battery life but button switch feels a little wimpy. It has never failed ( I thought it had but found that my wife just tried to turn it off by twisting like originally done, fixed that) but is so light to the touch I worry that the switch my fail under tough conditions. I keep it around the house for pre-dawn dog walks and inspections but for adventures away from home I have beefier lights. Around the house, this makes a great small bright light!!!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|iT'S EASY TO SET UP AND EXTREMELY USEFUL. It works accurately and simply. It's like having your own cloud since you can access all the files on your computer.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A great story that captured my attention from the start.  Interesting to see the same story through the eyes of two different narrators.
B00BSBU4EC|1.0|It kept stopping constantly to \\"load\\" and the quality when it WAS going was awful. Really mad that this happened on a movie we paid $5 bucks for. And I know it was not our Internet causing the problem.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I did not find it as challenging as some of the other games I had ordered and tried and it was just so-so.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|Almost non-stop action, pure mind numbing entertainment for entertainments sake. William fichtner had a great part and Cage was his usual, consistent performance. No great social or literary masterpiece, and that is just fine. Nudity and violent. Just a heads up.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Enjoyed it, not a whole lot of excessive back and forth like a lot of these kind of ho games and flowed pretty well.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|When I heard &#34;Love and Loss&#34; from the album &#34;Archangel&#34;, I was hooked. This was music heard like in soundtracks but in its own style that had me envisioning all sorts of imaginary scenes that would fit it. Skyworld does indeed have some that are like that, just like the other two from the same artists. The titles might give one some ideas to think on while listening, but anyone knows that music is meant to be appreciated for its own sake rather than just tied to the movie or story it accompanies. This just takes it a step further to allow one to dream their own dreams and flesh out their own epic stories. Great for listening to, just for itself.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|It's difficult to decipher what the game wants from you, to me most of it doesn't make a lot of sense.
6305428387|5.0|Yes, this was based on the true story of the Jamaican Bobsled team, the anomaly that took the Calgary Winter Olympics by surprise. As a rule, I am not fond of sports stories, but this one surprised me. A young Jamaican runner attempts to enter the Summer games but is stymied by another runner in the qualifying finals to enter when he his tripped up and left in the dust. Even though it is too late to enter into the Summer Olympics, he decides to try a winter sport, bobsledding. There are several problems, Jamaica is a Carribean Island Paradise that has never seen snow and bobsledding is almost unheard of there. No one is willing to lend a hand to help him as they are too busy laughing at the idea, but there is a way. His father knows of a former bobsledding champion living on the island who might be persuaded to coach a bobsled team--if he can find one. He winds up with a group of misfits including the runner that tripped him up. Persuading the coach isn't easy either and these are only the first of the hurdles he must pass if he is to even be in Calgary for the Games. Somehow, they manage to pull themselves together as they must literally learn everything from the ground up in a hurry as they are facing competition-and ridicule from the Champion athletes of the Ice, and the Coach, finds himself facing his past and trying to reconcile it for the sake of his team. In the end, their greatest hurdle is not to win, but to prove that they are every bit the champion athletes they hope to be.

B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I couldn't connect with any of the characters even though they were convincingly depicted.  I had no empathy for any of these people.  While the scenic descriptions were vivid and clear, I didn't care anything about the main character, his family and those he met along his journey.  While the book read realistically and I could imagine all of the events, I was bored and kept waiting for something to happen that would make me care about any of these people
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining and funny as well as heart warming.  Makes you realize that love goes a long way in the world.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|You don't have to be a teen ager to love The Hunger Games, waiting on the sequel!  The books are great and the movie is great, watch it and enjoy!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I've been using this for a few weeks and it has no gotchas I can find and little (reasonable) to wish for outside of aesthetics. I go to meetings, swipe notes, then email to my desk and copy paste. I also keep a lot of lists. If I had to ask for anything it would be a table of contents and chapters in the book. Maybe that will be in the paid version which I intend to purchase. Nice going on this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game for kids who want a horse love this game great game I love it. llllllllllooooov vvveeeee iiitttt. yeah yeah yeah
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Despite what the other reviewers are saying, this is not a fake review; I've been reviewing on Amazon since 1999, and I'm not affiliated with the app developers in any way.<br /><br />I don't know anything about app security so this review is just about the game experience.<br /><br />Below is the review I wrote before I read all the warnings about the permissions.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I loved this game. It may be for kids but I couldn't stop playing it.<br /><br />It is crisp and colorful, and the graphics are wonderful.  It has a pleasant soundtrack and the sound effects are great. There is also an amusing story that goes hand in hand with the action.<br /><br />And the action, well the action is delightful. LUNA, the little moon, accidentally sneezes herself out of the Earth's orbit and goes spinning off into space. She must find her way home by zigzagging her way through a solar system of planets, stars and asteroids. To control her journey through space she sneezes.  Along the way she gets pulled into the orbits of other planets where she can collect stars which are in turn used to buy special powers/abilities. When all the planet's stars are collected she sneezes to get out of their orbit and continue on her trek home. Other objects encountered along the way are ice zone, butterflies, and Elvis of all things. But at all cost she must avoid the crab nebulae because once trapped by the nebulae the game is lost.<br /><br />This is a really, really cute game.<br /><br />On the negative side I found the opening comic (which explains the story) difficult to understand. It makes more sense after you play the game, but the first time through it was just plain confusing. I also found it difficult to steer Luna's \\"sneezes\\" and make her go in the direction I wanted. The sneezes acted like mini propulsion rockets shooting her off in unexpected direction. And I'm sorry to say I was never able to escape the crab nebulae. I was never able to get Luna home. The final negative is the permissions. Hummm... don't know if I like those. I'll have to look into that some more.<br /><br />So beside the questionable permission this is a wonderful game. Visually pleasing, fun to play, and a surprising challenge in physics and propulsion.to escape the crab nebulae. I was never able to get Luna home. The final negative is the permissions.

B00004XQ83|2.0|The cd does not play well, I am unsure whether to trash it, the first song does not play at all.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A true story with real heroes, people willing to risk their lives for others. Ben Affleck had a vision and saw it through, just like his character in the movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The ease of reading this book was amazing very well imagined, the characters were very enjoyable just a great book.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I loved this book, because wolves and huskies are some of my favorite animals. This book was beautifully written, and I would recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs and wolves.
B009MYARIK|5.0|So Funny and crazy, a typical Sophie Kinsella book! Always a good read. I couldn't put it down. Won't disappoint
B0097EWK3A|4.0|As others have said, it's a good mix of hidden object and puzzles.  A good challenge, just wish some of it didn't feel quite so contrived. &quot;I remember now...&quot; seems a little over used towards the end
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Have tried other RDP products, this is the easiest to set up and use.  The user interface, with keyboard, mouse pointer with click feature make it very easy to navigate on smaller screen.  I would highly recommend for anyone looking to access their office or home computer remotely.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|At a time when the unity of the nation and human equality hung in the balance Lincoln proved to be the right person in the right place to deal with these issues.<br /><br />Great acting all around by Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader and several others that will be recognized.<br /><br />Daniel looks so much like photos of Lincoln at times it's almost creepy.<br /><br />One can only imagine the great weight that Lincoln carried on his shoulders but this is depicted by Lewis in his performance quite well.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This has almost all of Kelly Clarkson's hit songs.  The song lineup semms very organized, too.  She has such a powerful voice.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|great rush in using your stylus pen makes it easier to enjoy the game helps to stimulate the brain cells
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Canon Product, Top of the line, Top dollar.  There's really no explanation needed.  It's got the same rubber gripping that the Canon 7D has, and it is made with the magnesium alloy just like the 7D.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Tarantino scripted a wonderful film. Great dialouge coupled with perfect casting. First rate acting by all. The only fault I would find is in the over the top shoot out scene in the films final half hour. Beyond that, it was a truly terrific film. Slavery is a difficult and sensitive issue. But I believe the film accuratly portrayed the true conditions that existed in certain parts of the pre-civil war South. DeCaprio's Calvin Candie represented and certainly was among the worst of the worst. Chritopher Waltz was ideal as Dr. King Schultz, what a great character. Jamie Foxx as Django - having just seen the film, I can't imagine anyone else playing the role, he owned it. A common criticism I've heard is that the film is overly, overtly bloody and graphic. I agree that it is very bloody, but I do not feel it gratuitous (other than the big final shoot out). I don't know why Tarantino felt the need to break away from \\"reality\\" in that scene after having spent the first 2 hours so wonderfully staying within its bounds.I would have been good with the scene if the body count had been 3,4 or even 8. But I lost track of how many \\"bad guys\\" Django killed (30???) before finally being captured. It just wasn't believable. And why do the bad guys always have to have such bad aim? I've never understood that. The hero can be standing alone in the middle of a room calmly picking off bad guys one by one with a dozen of them shooting at him and never hitting anything. Again, unbelievable. But nothing is perfect. Overall a solid four stars. A film I will definitely watch again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Can't believe never heard of this book. I thought it was great. Why isn't it a movie? Hope someone picks it up.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|not bad!<br />this was an impulse buy. it has been interesting and fun. enjoy. no bugs that i can see. i don 't normally spen money when i can get most games for free,  but i 'm glad i indulged.
B004HGBUXE|5.0|I am a big fan of Lucinda Williams. She has a great voice with soul. This CD is another good one from her. You will enjoy it.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Daniel Craig just doesn't have that je ne sais quoi that Sean Connery had.  He seems too grim.  Many of the scenes were set pieces like the fight on top of a moving train which opens the film.  Can't these guys think of something original?  The women are gorgeous as usual, the music is pretty good, the plot forgettable as usual.  I guess this Bond is supposed to appeal to us old guys, since he is supposed to be losing his touch.  All in all, moderately entertaining.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|A concise and direct approach to dieting.  A doable diet for the long term health benefits.  Scientifically based and researched.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I guess everyone can see something of themselves in DW's character: someone trying to be something he's not, or not be seen as something he is.  How far can you get on bluster and denial?  The story is not too believable, but then it's not really about piloting an airplane, but piloting a life.  Denzel Washington is great as uaual.  Don Cheadle is also fine in the role of the lawyer and John Goodman is frighteningly real as a procurer and enabler. As for character development, it might have been better to show how the pilot character goes through stages from denial to acceptance.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I am a history major and have a special place in my heart for the Vikings. While this is certainly Hollywood, they do an excellent job here.  It's mostly historically accurate so far... You have to watch the first three or four episodes before you can judge.  I was disappointed at first and now it's grown on me considerably.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Great movie. If you love mobster movies. Plenty of action. Keeps you on your toes. The wife liked it too.

B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Jake Bugg's self-titled CD is a delightful freshman set.  \\"Lightning Bolt\\" sizzles with retro-originality to open the set with its up-tempo melody and some tasty electric guitar as it breaks into a brief bridge, \\"Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth, but I just stand by and I wait my time; They say you gotta toe the line; They want the water not the wine; but when I see the signs, I'll jump on the lightning bolt.\\"  \\"Two Fingers\\" rocks with more delightful 60s-retro melody, \\"I got out, I got out, got out alive and I'm here to stay.\\"  \\"Seen It All\\" has a delight pop feel with an upbeat melody and a dark lyric about a stabbing at a party with Jake's voice wry, loaded with shades of expression from excitement to regret.  \\"Broken\\" is a sweet slow-tempo track that sounds like it has a moving story hidden between the lines whatever they mean, \\"Wheels like tong to the winter lope.\\"  While these are my very favorite tracks on the set, there are no clinkers.  With an eye to our musical past, Bugg reinvents the future.  Enjoy!
B006JD48NM|5.0|The death 1994 of Senna, along with that of Roland Ratzenberger during practice the day before, was a shock to the entire Formula 1 community.<br /><br />The good news is that substantial safety measures were initiated after their deaths that have probably saved a number of lives in F-1 racing since.  As of the beginning of the 2013 season, there have been no fatalities in Formula 1 since Senna's accident.  See  [...]  for more details regarding this subject.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|The movie is excellent, with spectacular performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the streamed video, especially as I had paid extra for HD.
1476734941|5.0|Great book! It answered my initial questions and concerns. Loved the charts and explanation of BMI calculation. So far it is easy to follow 5/2 routine.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Excellent book! It's a book about feelings, emotions, loneliness, and friendship.  It's about trying to find happiness and to establish a sense of belonging.
B000JBWWBK|3.0|I was disappointed with this soundtrack because it seems to me a lot of the songs are additional--not original to the movie.  I was frustrated when listening to it.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Loved the series when I saw it on TV years ago, but couldn't remember details, so as a Prime Member I decided to watch it for free and I wouldn't be out anything if it wasn't as good as I remembered.  I AM HOOKED.  This set the standard for many shows that followed, but none were as quirky, humorous, and down right terrifying as Twin Peaks.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting superb, the character development and writing, brilliant!

B003ASLJRW|4.0|Not sure if this was a taped movie of filmed. The reason is I have a 1080P Blu Ray player and Full HD TV. There were many scenes that looked like an up-converted standard DVD. I realize this is an older movie yet the older movies in the '60's I have of Clint in Blu Rayare very crisp clear do to what I think is a remaster of the film, not tape. So, that is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. It is harder to remaster a taped version.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Just loved this adorable movie! I think it was made about my family!:-) the acting was outstanding and the cast was so well chosen! Feel good movie at its best!
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|If you just take a moment to look at the permissions that the app ask for you to approve of you'd notice that this app is not safe and is pretty much just malware. I'm certain all the good reviews were done by the company and friends of the company which would be extreamly bias and unaware of how to properly review apps. I'm pretty sure by the end of the day every one who downloads it not knowing what it is (since it's free today) will unistall and give it a bad rating upon using it. Stay away from this until they change permissions. It's a shame because by the time they fix it (if they fix it) it won't be free anymore. I don't think the company is bad people but I still don't trust apps that ask for more power than they need to opperate properly.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Wow! The acting was phenomenal. Sweet, touching story of love, compassion, passion and acceptance. Loved this movie. Feel good movie at its best. Very well written.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Let me see all of my pages. Look up lil d. The profile pic is kinda dark but has two boys on it.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I was disappointed in the turn the series took. What happened to Matthew was over the top. How much more could one family take?
B002VISN9E|5.0|The language was good and the sketches were delightful. It was totally refreshing to read.<br />Appropriate for all age groups.
0544002318|5.0|Speaking from the standpoint of a person who both loves endurance activities, and embraces a plant-based lifestyle, Scott is a heroic figure. It isn't easy to step away from eating a diet that is not only seen as normal and necessary, but is often associated with the American way of life; our right. Many see those who shun animal products as living a dangerous existence, fraught with inevitable nutritional deficiencies. Others take offense at the implication that what is normal to eat as an American could possibly be leading to the illnesses and ensuing pharmaceutical cascade most in this country will face at some point in their lives. I have been mocked by my family and frequently meet with rolling eyes and impatience when trying to order food at a restaurant. Scott was initially seen by his running colleagues as crazy for giving up animal products; that there was no way he would be able to endure much less thrive with out animal based protein. What Scott figured out, however, is that plants provide not only easily metabolized protein, but didn't put his body through the trauma of having to deal with the inflammation meat and dairy causes--his recovery times actually diminished, he could train more often and longer and his protein intake was not compromised... interestingly, spinach, for instance, and beef have nearly the same percentage (51% and 53% respectively) of their calories as protein.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book. Scott is generous with his insight into running and life in general. He shares some really good recipes (my favorite is his Minnesota Winter Chili) and thoughts about how best to eat and run. Thank you Scott!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great series. Must start from beginning. A lot better than tv show. Can't wait till book 6 comes out. I amhhooked
6305882592|5.0|I doubt this movie could be made today. It is easy to make, market and sell violence, but a movie about what it means to truly live isn't going to fly, especially when it's a love story between a suicidal 20 year old and a free spirited nearly 80 year old. This is a movie that (along with others of the same era: A Clockwork Orange, The Graduate, and others) confronts a society of stark and unyielding expectations. Very few are able to completely conform; to push down the fire that is their spirit to live, we just do our best to seem as though we fit in; to appear &#34;normal.&#34; Harold finds through Maude a window into his own life and how to at least begin to live it. My wife and I watch it at least a couple times a year. A true classic!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|it takes up to much storage space i repeated alp my games and I still don't have enough storage make it take less storage space and I will maybe deserve 5 stars
B000FC1HBY|5.0|No spoilers but such a sad book and exciting!  Can't wait for what comes next! Just when you think winter has come.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|my son and I really enjoy this game. loads of fun for hours of enjoyment. this game is addictive!!. I have bought the full version.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Well thought out, with so many plots going on but easy to follow.  After just the first season I feel I know all the characters.<br />The biggest thing I got out of it is &#34;WE ARE ALL OK!&#34;  Everyone is cool in their own way! Luv'd it!
B0054SMID0|5.0|Matthew McConaughey did an incredible job in his role as the lawyer... great story and makes you want to fix the system  - he didn't fix the system but he did the right thing!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|A great ride if you like Tarantino.  If not, skip it. An interesting telling of Brunhilda in the context of slavery and the old west.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Exelent! Acting is amazing,great photograpy,script. and art work...you'll be at the old western the old gangster L.A. The movie is absolutely credible.. The Director was amazing..The actress really beauty full. If you are at home and want to pass a nice time watching Tv rent it
0385349831|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was full of really deep ideas and quotes. It wasn't as good as Alchemist, but still enjoyable. Some of the best quotes include:<br /><br />* \\"Don't give up. Remember, it's always the last key on the ring that opens the door.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Wait patiently for the right moment to act. Do not let the next opportunity slip by you. Take pride in your scars.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Scars speak more loudly than the sword that caused them.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Difficulty is the name of an ancient tool that was created purely to help us define who we are.\\"<br /><br />* \\"I'm not worried about tomorrow, because God is there already, waiting for me.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Anxiety is part of love, and should not be blamed because of that.\\"<br /><br />* \\"And to those who believe that adventures are dangerous, I say, try routine; that kills you far too quickly.\\"<br /><br />These are a pretty good overview of the tone, messages, themes and lessons in this book. As I said, I really enjoyed reading it. It made me think.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I really love this movie.  It certainly isn't the best made movie around, but the story was written for people like me.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|It has a lot of space and pockets. I have HP pavilion dv7 17.5 inch laptop and this bag has enough room for it. yet if you have 17.5 inch laptop sleeve case then it would not fit properly.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is so much fun. I have trouble putting it down. It is challenging and the graphics are great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Not typical John Grisham, and very exciting from start to finish.  I highly recommend this book.  Need more John Grissom to read.
B00005Q6BR|5.0|This CD was underappreciated by the media. It's a lil long and some songs could have been cut out. But overall this CD has CLASSIC elements and is a very strong return. It did go numner 1 in the US and overseas for a lil bit but didn't get the promotion and airplay i felt it deserved.<br /><br />my favorite songs..well...I be listing the whole CD actually lol...so here are the standouts on this opus<br /><br />Break of Dawn truly amazing<br />Heaven can wait- amazing soundscape amazing<br />Butterflies-astounding song just beautiful, got radio play<br />Whatever Happens- with Carlos Santana the LEGEND, AMAZING SONG<br />Threatened - THIS SONG IS DOPE AS F^^^ through the use of technology they mad the dude from the old twilight song rap a verse OMG<br /><br />90% of this CD is freakin DOPE, More people should show love to this release, its a gem unheard largely.<br /><br />R.I.P Michael-<br /><br />Screw these court cases, he was innocent sued and image tarnished cause of greedy people wanted money. Looking at his life<br />if we had his life we'd all be addicted to some drug. All you haterz cannot cast stones case ya'll aren't perfect and therefore have no right whatsoever,<br /><br />get this CD
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I was not watching this series originally, and had to catch up.  The best of the series was season five, and I highly recommend this to those of us especially of the 60's era.
B002BIULQ2|3.0|Movie itself was OK, but has a few skips in it during the best music scenes in the movie, which is why I bought it in the first place, coulda  just watched it on Youtube for that.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|If I thought it was something that I could correct that would be different. However, it is telling me that it will not work on my Kindle Fire. Why offer this product to someone who has a Kindle Fire then after the fact let them know that it does not work on that device?
1607066017|5.0|Saga is the most innovative, fun, and interesting comic I've read maybe ever. I eagerly flipped through every page. I would recommend to anyone looking for something different from the average comic book. The characters in Saga are real, relate-able, and exciting to read about and look at. I've never read a comic quite like Saga before.
1558908382|5.0|Had to get it as a gift for a friend. The soundtrack is awesome and the movie itself a blast.
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|This show cracks me up.  After a long day or a long week, running episodes of this in the background is a great way to unwind.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|I play this on my Android phone. Cute graphics, easy game play to learn, but hasn't grown old yet.  I haven't played this with any other humans, but the automated opponents are good enough to be challenging without making it impossible to win. I like that the variety of board shapes affect my strategy, and that the random placement of fish at the start makes the game different every time.  The short duration of a game makes it good to kill a few minutes without getting too sucked in.
0385523912|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, then read parts aloud to my family and friends. Through following the stories of the detectors, I learned more about North Korea in one day than I had in a lifetime of news reports. Gripping!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|this is another one of those shows that became really popular after it was canceled and to late to revive. my advice to any one is to watch the series then watch the movie. its never coming back and that's probably a good thing. this series was perfect and they didn't get a chance to mess it up.
B0076794IO|5.0|A very absorbing, interesting story.  Really enjoyed the main character and the complications in her life.  Couldn't put it down.  A good twist to the story.
B00683JLXA|4.0|Found this to be pretty much the same as Angry Birds.  Actually kind of disappointing.  Kids liked it, but tired of it fairly quick.
B006O7XOOW|5.0|My 7 month old thinks that she can walk so this toy is perfect for her. She can cruise on it and it keeps her attention so she doesn't do her favorite nose dive all over my living room.
B00BI6SSMC|3.0|Sam Beam must be a very restless person. With each album, he presses himself towards new musical idioms, sometimes working, sometimes not. On \\"Ghost on Ghost,\\" his sixth album, he decides he wants to be in the same jazzy realm as a Van Morrison or Joni Mitchell, infusing the songs with horns, piano and blues. This is one of those times where it doesn't work.<br /><br />Beam, as Iron and Wine, has one of the most pleasing voices in popular music. He rarely lifted himself above a whisper on classic folk albums like \\"The Shepherd's Dog\\" and \\"Our Endless Numbered Days,\\" so I was surprised the first time I saw him live; he sang with a full throated tenor. He leapt to that level of singing on \\"Kiss Each Other Clean,\\" an album whose sonic excursions reminded me of Lindsey Buckingham at his weirdest. \\"Ghost on Ghost\\" pulls in the reigns on that experimental project and returns to the musical. But where \\"Kiss\\" was produced in extremes, \\"Ghost\\" is over produced in a poppy-lite fashion.<br /><br />Beam writes songs that are strong on melody and often strong on message. He can deliver a story-song like few men working in today's music scene. Nowhere is this more evident than \\"Ghost's\\" \\"Winter Prayers.\\" Unencumbered by the dense production of much of the album, it's Beam, guitar and piano with some light percussion. It delivers its message without hindrance from the bulk of the album's near easy listening style. I still love Iron and Wine, however, I never expected Sam Beam to deliver an album so extraordinarily average. \\"Ghost on Ghost\\" is a disappointment in an otherwise stellar discography.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Can't say enough about this series I own the first 3 and will be purchasing the final season.<br />If you haven't seen it, you are missing a great series.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I loved this book. Many twists and turns! A must read! Rich characters. A wonderful story that will keep you guessing
0618918248|5.0|The book I wish had been available many decades ago to a questioning teenager (me) unsatisfied by the &#34;explanations&#34; of the religionists I was told not to question.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Good description of a very complex situation. Book went a little long describing everyone involved. He kept hammering his point with each new character. Book could have been half as long. Good read, but you could stop reading after you understand what caused the crisis.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I was disappointed with the way this was arranged.  I would<br />Would have preferred that it were not going back and
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My two 6 year old grandchildren love it. And I love that it keeps them busy.<br />Too bad they didn't have toys like this when I was raising kids.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It was an okay game I'm confused I just passed through the mirror how to I continue the game?<br />Help me please?!?!?!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I am addicted to this series.  Quite graphic for me.....so I close my eyes at times. But just have to see what is next.<br />Betty
B005UDD1R6|4.0|This was a good app it let me watch the stuff that I liked but I had to downloaded another thing and it was<br />Hard
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Steep and Tommy Lee Jones did an excellent job. I got my husband to watch it with me (after I had watched it) and it hit some issues that we were dealing with.  Highly recommend this movie to help get the spark back into your marriage!  Betty
B000003FD9|5.0|This music gets me through rough times in my life. I lost my Starker Bach discs in a divorce and bought my own copy immediately upon separation. I play them often and listen for my peace.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I am a teacher and I love this calculator.  I can do my grades several different ways.  Love the virtual paper.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Visuals and spirituals are super! I read the book, saw the movie in 3d and now I can watch it over and over! My dreams come true!
B00B2274W2|5.0|1. You have to like the genera to enjoy the movie.  I think the acting is at its best in these.  The characters are believable for vampires.  :)<br /><br />2. I am impressed with my Kindle Fire HD.  The picture is clear and the sound is amazing.<br /><br />3.  The streaming video is excellent.
B002QZ399G|4.0|The plot is the emphasis of this movie.<br /><br />There are a number of characters and differing points of view from each.  The complexity of the movie captures the complexity of the Middle East.<br /><br />You need to be able to think and remember when you watch this flick.
B0086700CM|5.0|Sitting and waiting at the hospital this game keeps me occupied.  I love the fact that even an old guy like me can understood how to play without reading endless pages of instructions.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|I always like just about anything with Bruce Campbell in it.  This is a great example.  It's a well-done moviy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Enjoyed the complex science and the pace. The dry humorous monograph kept the plight of the stranded astronaut real. Everything one could want in good science fiction.
B00138H1MS|5.0|and this album is worth purchasing. I enjoy listening to it, along with my other Elvis albums, and plan to expand my Elvis collection.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I'm so glad I found this show. It is the best show i've seen in a long time. thank you
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!  It is the best game ever.  Not so easy that it gets boring but challenging and yet I can win periodically.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I ran across this movie a while ago one night on cable TV.  I fell in love with it at first watch.  I kept looking for it to play again so I could DVR it, but it was never re-run again that I could find.  So I bought the DVD.  the music is excellent, the story, like August believes, is a fairy tale about music bringing people together.  Robin Williams is always a treat in movies like this, very talented, but not a scene stealer, he just makes all of the characters shine with him.  I recently got my first Big Screen HD TV with surround sound installed in my bedroom, so I just bought the Blue-Ray version and the Soundtrack on CD with free digital download. They both rock on my system, I'll probably have to get another copy of the Blue-Ray because I could watch it over and over again!  Just be sure to have a box of tissues handy.  It's just one of those little sleeper movies that grabs you and never lets go!  Go get it, you won't be sorry (just don't tell anyone that you don't want to know that you actually do have a heart find out!)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it Is the best game in the whole wide world you should deffenitly get totally fun
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Very entertaining!!  Jamie Foxx plays a great roll many funny parts and great shoot outs.  A must see movie.  Bye
076115728X|5.0|I love this book! This is the sweetest book, perfect for the budding young artist or for anyone who likes to find beauty in unexpected places. I bought this for my 1 year old son and he has fun turning the interactive pages.
0679735909|5.0|A.S. Byatt has the most wonderful command of the english language. Sometimes I had to use the dictionary, which I kept close at hand.  It was well worth it.
B0026P40NU|1.0|This film is not about the PRB. It steals the most salacious details from the members' lives and creates a wholly different portrayal. Admittedly, I did not finish the series. I am ok with some artistic liberties taken, but this crossed the line. Very disappointed. Even trying to think about it objectively, as if I had no prior knowledge of the PRB, I can't imagine being very fond of it, as the characters are so unlikeable. If you are a fan of the PRB, or want a faithful history of their lives, avoid this like the plague. Go read a book instead.
B002RI9MZC|5.0|THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST READS OF THE PAST YEAR FOR ME. HIS FACINATING MIX OF FACT AND FICTION WAS SO REFRESHING AND MADE FOR A VERY BELIEVABLE PLOT. I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED BOYD AND THIS DID NOT DISAPOINT. HE REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE WRITERS.
B00C32R64G|2.0|I was seriously NOT impressed with this album. Volbeat has been one of my favorite new bands but I could only get into two of these songs and they were not that great either. I have always seen Volbeat as a rockabilly/punk influenced metal band, key part being \\"metal band\\". Sure they have always had some very popish elements to their music but it was just barely enough to give the albums some hook. Well, this one is basically a quarter of the metal, an eighth of the punk, NONE of the rockabilly and 10X the pop but the songs still don't have any hook!<br />I am an American and I like plenty of American metal bands, that is not what I am looking for when I want to listen to Volbeat. I think they made a BIG mistake with the new guitarist, it just sounds like Poulsen recorded an album with a completely different band. The overall sound of the guitars has changed. What used to be my favorite aspect of the Volbeat sound was the crushing guitar tone, not anymore!<br />If the pop style songs have been some of your favorites from Volbeat, maybe this album is for you. If the heavier songs have been your favorite, you may just want to download the couple of individual songs that are worth listening to and leave it at that. Some of my favorites from Volbeat have been The Warriors Call, Still Counting, and Heaven Nor Hell, there is nothing like that on this album.<br />Let's hope the next album is better.<br /><br />Hey Volbeat! Drop the new guitarist and find another Dane!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use interface, options for look and angle, can set what style to play. it's pretty much a perfect solitaire app. noreal complaints.
0786886811|5.0|I have loved this cookbook, written in a very lovely personal style.  And I have given it to others as a gift to share my enjoyment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the detail and there is so much you can do.Also you can change the horses name!!!! I love this
B00AYPXG5W|3.0|good story i guess but very old movie could be a lil out dated not a bad watch on a sun afternoon though
1401322786|5.0|It took a while to get into the book but once there it was a fast read. I finished it  in two days and enjoyed it very much.
B005J2V74C|3.0|Cheap scares and never really goes anywhere. kinda drags on and on after a while you just start wondering if its ever gunna end.
B009GJBBDQ|4.0|Plays well through Amazon and my Roku. Pierce was a good Bond and I like his Bondness. Good locations and characters.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|First, I am a huge Beach Boy fan. I have seen this band in concert many times since 1966. I was totally impressed with the 50th REUNION TOUR and the forty plus song list that was performed. Yes the DVD has a fraction of the songs but the DVD is awesome. I purchased the Blu-Ray version and the quality and sound is magnificent. If you like THE BEACH BOYS you will like this video
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|The sound quality is not up to par with some of his other albums, but I love the old songs.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It's a so far fun game haven't had any problems in it and keeps my attention. Which with a house full of teenagers it's very calming.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I would have rated this more stars but I didn't because of the very explicit sexual content so far in each episode that I have seen.  I think it would be very good entertainment if it wasn't for that.  I don't think I will purchasing another season.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I just finished watching an amazing period piece, the likes of which surprised me to no end.I first became aware of this film when I watched the Academy Awards and saw all the nominations it was up for . First of all ,I am not a huge Quentin Tarantion fan although I have seen some of his movies and they have been good. However, having said that, this one is in a category that can't be touched and I understand he developed and wrote the story line. Let me just say , the entire cast was wonderful but I felt Christoph Waltz was just incredible and I have never seen Jamie Foxx in this dramatic of a roll and he pulled it off with flying colors.The movie is 166 minutes but I got so caught up in it ,the time passed very fast.I highly recommend checking this one out , just be aware the blood is a plenty.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is my favorite in the series!!!! Has a lot of action and adventure! Awesome book! Anyone who loves fiction this is the book for you!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first this game seemed extremely simple and I wondered if it was going to be something I'd actually enjoy. I'm glad I stuck it out, if you love games that .make you think you'll love this one. Its free, give it a chance.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|The movie and this soundtrack work so well together that as soon as I had the chance I downloaded it to my phone. Its one of my favorite soundtrack to listen to.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Does the job I wish it would save your position in longer videos that would give it the 5th star
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I love Michael Chiklis, great actor! I am rewatching episodes! One the most raw series ever! Love Amazon prime, thanks!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I like sci-fi, so when I read about this series in Wired Magazine, I immediately bought Wool 1-5. I couldn't stop reading, staying up too late, and couldn't wait to finish it. Now I'm excited to move on to the rest of the series. I think the character development will appeal to sci-fi and non-sci-fi fans alike! The cold truth of what happens in the first chapters is surprising, and kept me wondering exactly what is going on for pages to come. Thanks to Mr Howey for a great series, I'm looking forward to finishing this series, and moving on to your other work!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story made me feel like I was right there fighting with her .This is another book I not put down.

B005IFWXWU|5.0|Everyone that has listened, really like this this cd. I would buy another one. Thank you so much and waiting to buy another
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Oh my gosh! This movie was funny! Clearly a movie for a more &#34;mature&#34; grouping due to the language-but I laughed and laughed! It really caught me off guard, not the &#34;standard&#34; Hollywood movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to collect recipes.  Pinterest helps keep them organized. I like seeing recipes that others have found and recommended.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Whether you are a woman or a man , whether you are a part of the work force or a stay at home parent you need to read this book.  If I could afford it I would buy a copy for every woman and man I know.  The evolution of the workplace and the home starts with each of us.  To quote Sheryl \\"We cannot change what we are unaware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.\\"  Read the book and become aware!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Good stuff. Now I can use Bento on my pc by connecting to my Mac.  ridiiculos making me use more words than I need to
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Any book by John Steinbeck is always a great read and this is one of his best!  It was great in my college years and still great 30 years later.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I like the story line and the old values it teaches.  The acting is good also.  Nice to see &#34;Mr Bates&#34; here.
B00004STDN|5.0|this was a intense movie from start to finish. Great action it is definitely a movie worth watching great movie.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I believe that anyone in IT will identify with at least some of the problems faced by Bill Palmer, the protagonist. This is a must read, I highly recommend it.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|NEEDS MORE INSTRUCTION ON HOW IT WORKS<br />i NEVER GET PASS THE FIRST SCREEN AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS UP OR DOWN
B000FC11A6|5.0|Whether it's actual history or just a brilliant author's poetic license (and I think it's both), this is a compelling story that's impossible to put down. I'm old enough to remember WWII, and still engaged enough in the world to appreciate...and use...the incredible digital skills of today. Then, as now...hackers rule!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Wonderful songs, I loved everyone of them. I would definately recommend it, even my co workers thought it was great.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Fascinating look at how we may react to any apocalyptic event. Cleverly written and will have you thinking long after you have put it down. Deserves a re-read.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|It's not what I thought it would be and not wasting space on HD for something i won't be using
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy this series, I love the wit of the situations, I love the twists and the sarcasm weaved in the story. But above all, I love how Julianna Margulies interprets her role. :)
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake keeps it real all the songs are great another terrific CD from Blake Shelton recommend it to every one
B00821OX98|4.0|The series is good but not excellent.  The show usually hold my attention and the actors do a good job.  I'm always hoping that there will be more communication between the aliens and the humans, but that rarely happens.  I'm about half way through session 1, and so far I am fascinated with the series.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|This is a great movie with an excellent cast. The soundtrack is awesome if you like great music you will love this movie.
0553103547|5.0|674 pages of non-stop narrative & action.  Most fantasy fiction falls flat from a literary perspective, and also runs the risk of being harshly compared to LOTR.  G.R.R. Martin matches J.R.R. Tolkien when it comes to imagination and complexity of purpose (though Tolkien will kick ANYONE'S ass when it comes to a mastery of the English language).  Martin also sets very high goals for his opus and peoples it with HUNDREDS of characters (seriously, I gave up counting after I hit two hundred).  The maps leave a lot to be desired, especially when he writes about lands for which the book provides NO maps (i.e., ALL the chapters concerning Daenerys).  THAT was a major error on the publisher's part.  The best literary device used is titling the multiple chapters via the names of the eight major characters: Bran, Catelyn, Daenerys, Eddard, Jon, Arya, Tyrion, and Sansa.  The perspective is third-person omniscient but filtered through the time and space of the character in the chapter title; very neat actually.  The plot is often non-linear, which can make the read a bit confused and confusing.  Chapters have a habit of overlapping a bit, but this can be attributed to the unique mode of communication used throughout the novel (raven).<br /><br />The book is really about House Stark and its delicate dance of death with House Lannister.  And, in Book1, things do not go at all well for House Stark.<br /><br />Tyrion is, clearly, the authors favorite character (and, mine), since he is given ALL of the killer lines in the book.  Many times, I found myself laughing out loud at the outrageous impertinence of The Imp.  This character comes completely alive as he is fully-fleshed out as a most fatally-flawed yet truly decent human being.  Hell, Martin could've just called the book Tyrion Lannister., not because most of the book's pages are dedicated to him, but because he steals the show.<br /><br />Catelyn has the most pages (106) but her character is too introverted and internally troubled to jump off the page, like Tyrion.<br /><br />Other characters that you can tell are headed for great stories in succeeding books (in addition to Tyrion) are the angry and under-developed Jon and the interesting and androgynous Arya.<br /><br />The one flaw in almost ALL the characters is something I suspect that Martin WANTED in the characters: they are all, to varying degrees, incredibly naive (stupid even) and self-destructive in their pursuit of either honor or power (or both).<br /><br />Also, the hedonistic sexuality and over-the-top barbarism might turn off the average reader.  However, Martin tries to bring alive (and does!) an age that parallels European medievalism.  In other words: don't get too attached to characters.  And there are just too damned many &#34;Houses&#34; to keep track of.  While I know the publisher probably balked at the expense, it sure would've been nice to have a comprehensive list of the Houses, together with all of their sigils (in color), castles, and lands.  Think The Clans of Scotland or Ireland and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />The ironic aspect of this book is that you will find yourself rooting for certain people (quite a few actually) to die horrible, grisly deaths (pretty much any of the Lannisters and Cleganes and members of the Small Council).  Of course, you also yearn to sit down for a beer with some of the other rascals (Tyrion and Bronn immediately come to mind).  If Martin can make you hate (and admire) some of his characters so viscerally, then you know he is doing something right.  He is a very compelling novelist and I very much look forward to watching the series now (which I had denied myself UNTIL I read the books).<br /><br />Lastly, while Tolkien's characters are too archetypical to identify with, most of Martin's are too barbaric.  Only a few rise to truly great heights, the highest of which is inhabited by Tyrion Lannister.  Bravo, Mr. Martin!  Bravo!  Who'da thunk we'd be made to cheer for sucha wretched, self-loathing dwarf - until we come to realize that he is the only character with a fully developed conscience and sense of true decency.  Bravo.a wretched, self-loathing dwarf - until we come to realize that he is the only character with a fully developed conscience and sense of true decency.  Bravo.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I really liked this movie, The part with Mr. Hide was kind of weird. I like the music in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUT VERY VERY ADDICTING!! I JUST WISH THAT THE GAME WAS A BIT MORE LENGTHY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SAVE WITH KEYS THAT U BUY BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THE GAME IS \\"DA BOMB\\"
B002RI9UKE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it lots of information and explanations. I found it better than the DVD<br />Will be recommending it to my friends. Will  also of course be trying everything out.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If you are bored this game is perfect<br /> I like to play classic cause there is no timer<br />Cool graphics
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. I read a lot and it wasn't the same run of  the mill romance novel. It kept you on your toes. I read it in one day. Addicted. Now on to Walking Disaster.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it works great.  love it you think you get what you pay for but this is clean and simple. yea!!
B005HSL626|3.0|I downloaded this game for my kids on my kindle fire.  They are able to play it a couple of times before it freezes, and then will not load again without an internet connection.  The game is fun but simple to learn and play.  Needs some maintenance for the app. to work better.  It is free, however,so the debugging may not happen any time soon.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Overall, the book is awesome.<br /><br />Some parts in it seem to stretch a bit. Just a bit.<br /><br />I hate that it's over. Waiting for the third one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun app for any solitaire fan. I recently downloaded the game for my kindle fire and now I play it daily.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is the consummate story teller. A true spinner of yarns. Full of believable characters . I couldn't let my kindle out of my hand.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Lord of the Rings aficionados will thoroughly enjoy this fist part of the Hobbit.  Yes Peter Jackson wants to make money by having more than one episode, but in order to capture Tolkien's details the saga will require more than one sitting.<br /><br />I'm looking forward for the next part.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This CD is really good. Buy it because you won't regret it. Its one of the best works of Marilyn Manson. Thank you amazon.com John R. Stematz!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed this book enormously.  The question of whether or not you will enjoy it depends on what kind of person you are.  Are you a bit of a nerd, interested in physics, astronomy, computers, biology, and other scientific and engineering pursuits?  Do you have a warped sense of humor?  Have you ever wanted to go to Mars?  Are you a little intolerant of authority?  For me, the answer to all these questions is yes. If you have similar attitudes, you will probably enjoy the book.<br /><br />I read the Kindle edition, which was out for just a few days before it was withdrawn in anticipation of the publication of a hardcover edition.  How often does that happen?
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another awesome Baldacci thrill ride. I am already reading The Hit.  I hope this continues as a series.<br /> Must read!!<br /><br />John
B0041QSZJM|4.0|I have a huge collection of Christmas songs and could not pass this one up. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised! It is one of the very unique Christmas albums I own. It is always nice to get a new style of album that stands out from the myriad of albums. The sounds have the cheery sort of Christmas aspect you expect for this season but the compositions are complex, unique and uplifting. I really like this album.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|He loves this series and was very happy to recieve  the season on dvd so he can watch as often as he wants.  Great price and definitely a great gift for zombie lovers
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|cool game<br />it is awesome because you have tons of armor<br />its awsome<br />do you ever think you can be like Tony stark well your wish can come tru
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Dark and different but a great story and really good acting  This is a must have if you like new versions of the fairy tales we grew up with
B0070DOHQS|1.0|not worth 10$ at all. i mean i would pay $0.99 but not 10 bucks. plz change back to free or $0.99! plz plz plz plz!
B00846REIS|3.0|Two very damaged people use sex to heal, kind of. Mildly entertaining but also infuriating. Sometimes I wanted to kick them both upside the head.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I ciuld not put this book down.  It gripped me from page one.  Highly recommended to all -young and old.
B007N8RULO|1.0|The app itself is fine. The  video advertising is absurd. The additional non stop advertising for Christian Singles amounts to the spreading of an ideology/religion rather than a product. No objection to advertising a product. I deleted the app
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this game because it gives you something to do in your FreeTime and it's a lot of fun!
B00BMQDM10|2.0|So much weaker than i expected. Jokes were predictible. I am a huge fan so i read it but it was weak.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I downloaded this app on my first generation kindle fire and found the gameplay smooth and problem-free.  The music is soothing and the sound effects aren't annoying.  It teaches kids (and adults) about real sea life and what goes into growing a coral reef and the fish that live there while using familiar characters from the movie.  Overall an A+ app.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is so great. But you have to pay for the full edition. I rated it a four because no where did it say I would have to pay to get the whole thing. That's my only concern other than that the game is great.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I'm a senior citizen who doesn't follow much of the current popular music.  Mostly I listen to classical, country, inspirational, and folk music from years ago.  Someone younger than me (which at this point in my life is most of my family and friends) posted the Alabama Shakes &#34;Hold On &#34; official video on Face Book, and I instantly liked that song.  After I'd played it several times I wanted to support the group and so I bought the album.  Now that I own the album, I recommend it to many of my friends.  I like a lot about this talented young group and look forward to hearing their next album.
1582406723|5.0|This is a very exiting and amazing comic. When I read I am lost in the scene, and can't seem to stop wondering about the scenario taking place. A definite 5 star rating!
B000065V42|5.0|The three movies on this theme had been forgotten.  I was pleased to see the title one day passing through the dvd's.  The first and last times I saw this was on Beta or VHS.  It retains its humor.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Great book.  Makes me proud of this land and delivers humor. Really shows the American outlook on life and culture.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it is fun to play, but kinda hard at the same time. a good challenge for anyone. destroy aliens :D
B005VTS4EY|5.0|awesome time killer. fun when nothing to do. got it for free on amazon app, such a great deal. get it :D
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Wanted this app long ago, but 9.99 was out of my price range. Got it on a good deal through amazon and this app rocks. Works awesome, except for the lag in video streaming, but that is probably due to SGSII's weak wifi antenna.. still, works as it should, i love it! :D
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great previous reviews and best bang for the buck. Use this on my i7 3770k @ stock settings. Runs awesome, just haven't felt need for an OC yet :D
B0044XUZ9K|3.0|I had never read Treasure Island so now with my Kindle I'm catching up on classics long overlooked.  A good book for the youth of today but doubt you could get a one to read it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|App works great! Use it every night with a pair of SleepPhones&reg;. Great combination and helps ease me right to sleep. Can't imagine not having it anymore. If you're on the fence just get it. Simple to use, tons of sound options and works as advertised. The best ambient sound app out there!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I would honestly tell you im the last person on the planet that thought i would like a musical program! But, my daughter got me watching it one day and now i cannot stop. at times it's inspiring and others uplifting. they do such an amazing performance in my eye. It is a straight forward show that isn't shy of modern day issues but, this is the way of life in these modern times. i would recommend just to give it a try and i bet you will be hooked. It's  just a Great program!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|A great show, Drama... Suspense... Great characters.  Worth your time to watch!<br />It will make the time fly... you will be wanting for the next season to start!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Written superbly! I did figure a lot of it out before the end.  I didn't want to set the book down. I highly recommend it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|For once, it can be said that the writers like to use twists and turns, but for the sake of the story, not just to create artificial events to keep us awake.<br /><br />In the meritocratic world of soaps, this seems to be a serious contender for a top ranking, next to Breaking Bad, Sopranos, The Wire and a few others.<br /><br />Thanks for offering us this chance to enjoy an hour after a tough day...
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|Maybe it is because the writers are trying too much? Maybe it is because characters cannot be so self-contradicting without being just paper characters - or schizophrenic? It was a disappointment, especially after reading so many raving reviews. The pilot is here to obviously plant seeds for the future, but it is far too obvious... And the result is that we can anticipate it too much. Of course attention to details, historical elements, research... Are impressive, but if the main story does not work.<br /><br />Maybe this soap to have deserved to be more of a Dos Passos-like approach? The story of a city itself, and less of characters? That would have been a change, and a much needed refreshing approach of soaps, beyond, the good, the bad and the forgettable.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I consider this rating because I love to game, I like everything at hands length. It fits and feels perfect in my hands
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Awesome movie, my grandkids and I watched it and it was great!!!!!!!!!!!! We loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So thought I would write my review.  Thanks
B009H5IS1W|5.0|i allways wait and buy each episode to watch on my ps3 no commercials i think it would be better if they were unedited
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|This app is really fun for someone like me who is not an artist but would like to experiment with drawing and painting in private without investing a lot of money in art supplies.  Drawings and paintings are easy to accomplish and can also be easily tossed out if they don't meet the overly critical eye of a beginner.  ...IF you are willing to put on your technical, computer, and free-spirit willingness to experiment with what all of the buttons and controls mean on your own.  ...If you can do that sort of thing and not get overly frustrated or you are willing to put down the app and step away for awhile and come back and experiment more when you get frustrated, you will likely really enjoy the tremendous quality and range of capabilities in SketchBook Pro.  I am enjoying it now that I have figured out some of the tools and I'm finding it a lot of fun.  If you don't have a lot of patience with technology without detailed instructions, find a different app that includes an instruction manual or only has extremely basic tools with no flexibility.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|I have been wanting this movie for a long time its as good as I remember I am 1005 satisfied that I got it
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is the best CD Depeche Mode has come out with since Ultra. There are several excellent songs. I can't stop listening to it.
B00005ONMP|5.0|I read the other reviews and have to agree that these recordings of Mendelssohn's symphonies and overtures are excellent.<br />The familiar themes of Mendelssohn will pull you in to listen closer and be rewarded with these energetic and emotional recordings by the London Symphony Orchestra.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I've been reading this series since the 1st book was published and the last book was just as good as th e first book.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I came to this book late. I don't get HBO so I only saw the series in bits and pieces. What can I say, I liked this book a lot.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I purchased the Amazon TV Pass last season and continued it this season. I'm a SPN super fan and being able to watch the EP's whenever I want is amazing. This season is much better than the last. The story development has been outstanding. I can't wait to see what's next.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|This is so cool - just hold the phone near the radio or whatever and you get what the song is and who sings it!  It's awesome for those of us who know a song and just can't quite place it.  I found it almost by accident and love it!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have all seasons of this series.  I am not that sure about having season 8 online, but it is easier to watch wherever I am.  I wish the others were online as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Boring doesn't have campaign or multiplayer its just like temple run.<br /> Don't get this game. Not worth the memory it takes up
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My boyfriend and I read these books together, aloud at night before bed. It's a great bedtime read and I find myself wanting to read without him just because it's in the middle of the day. The main character is relatable. Some of the words in the book can make it a difficult read for some, but overall it flows. It's a fun and easy read. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|No game needs to collecting this type of data and running in the background!  With our privacy levels decreasing on a regular basis, this is an unacceptable addition to the mix!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Who wouldn't love these shows! Got to love the old toons brought to life, and done so well. Bring on more!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is the best digital calculator replicating what you generally have sitting on your desk .  I recommend it highly for ease of use, great displaying of calculations.
B007712XAU|5.0|These DVD's arrived in excellent condition. They are very well done. I am enjoying  them very much. Maybe you have to be as addicted to Downton Abbey as  I am to be so enthused. I am planning to buy Season Three and Season Four.
1401201911|5.0|this book was excellent, very full of easter eggs for Comic book fans of all DC comics. Look for Lori Lemaris and Sivanna!
B00028HBKC|4.0|If you are seeking a well done movie covering Christ's passion, then this is it. It covers the story straight from the bible which a high level emotion. We purchsed this as a gift to our son and his girlfriend understand the story better, since reading is not their favorite at this point in their lives.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed all three books. I've have repeat reading all three several times. Easy read and keeps you wanting to know what's next.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|For such an inexpensive gaming mouse, it offers everything i would want in a mouse. It looks sleek, is programable, and has a great feel. The number of buttons on the mouse also is perfect without being excessive. The driver is also easy to use while also being advanced enough to fit all my needs. The 2 profiles is very helpful as i can have my normal life browsing profile and my gaming profile. It can go really high on the DPI, which i will never use, but if you are more into shooters i could see wehre that would be helpful. The only problem i have with the mouse is the symbol for anker i think is a little dumb and also I wish that all the lights on the mouse would change color instead of just the one.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Simple and Awesome. Overall a great game that does not have much too it but is extremely fun. Just great.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I started reading this novel for a book club that I'm in. We were supposed to finish it by June, but I've finished it in three days. The ending was a little anti-climatic, but it isn't really a happy ending sort of novel. I would absolutely recommend it, if only to see you squirm trying to figure it out.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love the characters and I enjoy farming games ... what's not to love? Nemo, his Dad, and other friends from the movie encourage you to plant and populate a reef's ecosystem with plants, corals, and various decorations to attract more sea life.
0385349831|5.0|\\"Manuscript Found in Accra\\" by Paulo Coelho, and translated by Margaret Jull Costa, is a beautifully written inspirational and thought provoking collection of parables, sayings, teachings, and guidance for the soul.<br /><br />You can read this short book from start to finish or open it most anywhere at random and find something deeply inspirational before you.<br /><br />A book I will always keep nearby for those times when my soul aches for nurturing and refreshment.
B002VT6C0K|3.0|I did not read all the stories, becuase &#34;Too much happiness&#34; seemed boring to me. However the other stories are ingeniuos, and in general show apparently ordinary people surmounting very difficult situations in unexpected ways. There is somehow a message of hope in some stories, and I liked that. Also, the author writes with great ease and in a very freindly way.
B00BI6SSMC|3.0|This is an initial reaction, literally after one full listen to this evening accompanied by several glasses of mezcal. there is a lot of talk here in the reviews already so i'll keep it short and sweet because what you want to know is 'are these good songs'... yes, they are, but...<br /><br />I am going to list right here the few that were truly, new or old, \\"Iron & Wine\\" tunes to me and everything that means to me (which is shared by many but still entirely subjective)...<br /><br />\\"Sundown\\"... very nice and akin to the work leading up to Shepard's Dog<br />\\"Winter Prayers\\"... a true Iron & Wine 'old school' tune with a newer feel<br />\\"Baby Center Stage\\"... reminiscent of In the Reins works with Calexico... lovely tune.<br /><br />I'll definitely listen again... and may post further thoughts, but that is enough for now.
B007THA4FI|4.0|JKR obviously does not like people.  She has created a plethora of the most unwholesome and unlikable characters who are abused, abusive and dysfunctional.  They lead unhappy lives, wallowing in self-pity, dreaming of revenge, and venting their frustrations and rage on family and friends.  The only two characters who show leadership, warmth and compassion meet untimely deaths.  However petty and sordid, their stories unfold neatly and I was compelled to finish the book to know what happens to everyone.<br />If this is a true picture of life in Britain today, it is beyond sad, for it is a life that holds no light, beauty or happiness for the future.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|This movie was all over the place in terms of tone. I found the comedic bits to be distracting and much too numerous, and the plot was surprisingly convoluted. And why would Tony give away his home address, even in a fit of rage? It just didn't make any sense, and I had trouble getting back into the movie. And those panic attacks? I couldn't understand why he had them, after all the crap he'd gone through before the lame aliens from \\"The Avengers.\\" The movie is very poorly paced, with a finale that goes on way too long.
0553328255|5.0|This is a great set of books.  All of the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for Sherlock Holmes.  The books are as described.  The slip cover is a good option.  The only drawback is how thick each book is.  But that is a lot to put in just 2 books.  Overall i am very pleased, especially for the price.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This game is tons of fun and I highly recommend this to all star wars fans or if you love pinball. I like how you choose a scene to make the game more challenging like avoiding a tie fighter, attacking a stormtrooper, possibly just about anything.
B00CDFWJIG|2.0|I saw this film in theaters, and it was clearly churned out in a hurry to capture more TWILIGHT dollars before the fad died off completely.  This was a real disappointment of a film considering its heavy hitters like Jeremy Irons and the rest of the adult cast. The story was weak, the effects were uninspired, the dialogue was really terrible.  If you're looking for something of quality in the sci-fi / fantasy category, I suggest you keep looking.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|worked great<br />very small and compact<br />ceramic easily refined my SOG FF30-CP Fielder 3.5-Inch Straight Blade Folding knife.<br />definitely recommend it
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|What a story, I work in sales myself so found a lot if useful closing tips in this book. I have a full on addictive personality myself so could totally relate to Jordans struggle. I have just booked a ticket to spend the day learning from Jordan later this month, can not wait.

B005CRQ3RK|5.0|My daughter is hooked with this books, she is 9 Years old and she has been reading  4 books of the series, she reads it in about two days and after ask me to get the next one.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is not the best on my kindle fire it is really slow and glitchy it is really hard to move when you have something like an iPad moving left to right to move around obstacles.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Brings me back to the 80s! Love it! Took me awhile before I found it. Now I play pacman all the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is very fun and it is cool.  I love how you can change character and how you can change boards.
1476734941|5.0|Got it fast and at a great price!  Easy to read and it even comes with suggestions for the fast days.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I find this is a very useful app. The graphics are a plus and the remaining time estimates are great as well.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I enjoyed it a lot its a great puzzle game. I am not very good at games and I completed it too quit Olympe and the only thing you can do withapp is play same boards over and over...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two continues the great series and we were able to watch it with ease.  I will buy the next season soon.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is engaging and addictive all in one!  It is fun for adults and children alike. Wish there were more opportunity to earn pearls though.  It sucks that a children's game makes you spend spend money to complete quests.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie and she wanted it for Christmas.  She loved it as a gift and watches it frequently.
B000OT6V00|4.0|If you like the movie, this Blu-ray release has sound and picture you would expect. Nothing really stupendous added in the directors cut, but nothing takes away as can be a problem with over long director/fanboy/superegotrip editions of some other movies.
B00004T9UF|5.0|m&m greatest cd ever quality,delivery very satisfied i have 2 more albums on my mind think this is the best quality product and fastest delivery i ever had
B003VVAE4W|5.0|I've loved this TV show since when I was in high school. Veronica is soooo cool, and the story is awesome. This has all mystery, romance, and friendship, etc..... I highly recommend you to watch this!!
B00AQA94M4|3.0|Feel free to disregard this review in light of my current musical preferences but my patience for extravagant theatrical epics has waned considerably since the last Avantasia album graced my speakers three years ago. Granted, I wasn't aware of this until hearing their latest opus, The Mystery Of Time.<br /><br />I've been a fervent supporter of Tobias Sammet for the past ten years due primarily to the following flaming arrows: 2004's Hellfire Club (Edguy) and 2008's The Scarecrow (Avantasia). As far as I'm concerned, the aforementioned albums are the creative benchmark for both respective projects and have cemented me as a fan regardless of the philosophical and musical shifts both outfits have subsequently adopted. Beginning with Edguy's Tinnitus Sanctus and Avantasia's The Wicked Symphony/Angel Of Babylon, both bands began a noticeable drift towards a hard rock oriented sound evident not only in the production but in Tobi's vocal delivery as well. The operatic power screams were replaced with a more rough and ready, rock n' roll wearied rasp and the frenetic and beefy Euro-styled rhythms were paired down to a rawer street swagger. I love hard rock but even so, I find myself less and less enamored with the sounds Tobi wants to make these days.<br /><br />As with all Avantasia projects there is an underlying story tacked on to The Mystery Of Time but understanding or relating to it in any manner is not required and in my experience not entirely possible. I really have no idea what's going on here from a story standpoint. That being said, musically, The Mystery Of Time makes a genuine effort to revisit the velocities of earlier Avantasia works. The problem here is the inability to maintain these velocities throughout entire tracks. In the attempt at grandiosity, many of these songs simply forget to rock. Some tracks seem epic just for the sake of being epic. Savior In The Clockwork and The Great Mystery (the song), both clock in at ten minutes and both squander precious time. Savior kicks off with an absolutely killer power metal riff but then diverges from it for the last half of the song. This would have been so much more effective as a four minute face-melter. Instead, I find myself disappointed. The promise of that glorious riff is never realized. Mystery has a similar problem. It's a diverse and detailed pomp smorgasbord that reminds me of a much heavier Styx. It's also in possession of a fantastic cloud-clearing chorus and yet, it never seems to get there quite fast enough. Instead, preferring to dive into quiet introspective passages and odd time changes. I get it. It's a progressive styled rock opera. I just find it tiresome and would much prefer something more immediate. Get to the point already.<br /><br />Thankfully, tracks like the symphonic Black Orchid and Invoke The Machine fill the void for straight-up ass-kickers.  Orchid is what I want from Avantasia. It's a dark metal pounder with cryptic lyrics and a huge menacing hook. This is the type of stuff Tobias should be doing more of. Now, I'm obviously biased towards Ronnie Atkins (Pretty Maids), but his brief appearance on Invoke The Machine stands out amongst the layers of clean, operatic vocals filling up every other nook and cranny of the album. I wish he was featured more.<br /><br />There is a noticeable emphasis this time on singers from a general hard rock background than ever before. Remember, this is no loner a \\"metal opera\\" but instead, a \\"rock epic.\\" Unfortunately, legendary vocalists like Joe Lynn Turner (Yngwie Malmsteen, Deep Purple), Biff Byford (Saxon), and Bob Catley (Magnum) seem to be lost in the mix.  Michael Kiske (Helloween), however, is always recognizable and still manages to thrill on old school power metaller Where Clockhands Freeze and Eric Martin (Mr. Big) is also a big surprise on the record's best ballad What's Left Of Me. The other ballad, Sleepwalking features a duet between Tobi and Cloudy Yang and is the type of track Tobi needs to start leaving on the cutting room floor. Very much in the vein of What Kind Of Love from The Scarecrow and like that one, the worst track on offer and a real flow killer.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This is a good album...but I feel it's also the weakest of the six. Something just seems off here. Something is missing. Could it be the absence of long time collaborator Jorn Lande? Perhaps. But, I think it's more than that. Some of these songs just don't have the magic one associates with Avantasia. The opener, Spectres, for example, kicks things off in fine form with some truly stirring orchestral work but then drops the ball with a rather middle-of-the-road hook. The same can be said of The Watchmaker's Dream. Fantastic musically, but mundane come chorus time.<br /><br />The special edition of the album features two bonus tracks, one being a remixed version of Death Is Only A Feeling from the Angel Of Babylon album and featuring John Oliva (Savatage) on vocals. This was one of my least favorite songs on the previous slab and the new version doesn't win me over. I always felt this was a weak attempt to follow up The Toy Master and I never warmed to Oliva's strange vocal delivery on it...even though I remain a huge Savatage fan. The other bonus track is a straight up hard rocker called The Cross And You. After all the belabored epics on the album proper this is actually a breath of fresh air. It's a fun track for the reason that it sheds all the pomposity and self importance of the album and just simply rocks. I think that may be my main problem with Avantasia these days. Yes, I realize this is billed as a \\"rock epic\\" but I was somehow hoping Tobi would start delivering some kick ass metal without all the theatrical dressing. If you're looking for something over the top and perhaps a bit ridiculous in the lyrical department then this Mystery will suit you fine. However, if you're like me and were hoping for more of a serious power metal vibe without all the high-minded frilliness you may want skip this one.<br /><br />6.5/10
0783208227|4.0|I really like it I had seen the movie years ago. While browsing I found it here. am now looking for DVD.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I do not read a lot of fiction books but occasionally a title catches my attention and I give it a read.  I certainly have to say that this one was very worthwhile.  It was very entertaining and kept me guessing all the way to the end.  I liked the surprise turn of events that happened about the middle of the story that causes you to flip-flop your whole thinking about what is happening.  This book is well written and will keep you in suspense all the way through.  It is an easy short read and I think you will like it.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|This book has opened my eyes - what an insight - what a gift - thank you Dr  Eben you have truly shown what happens when we pass on
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've played both Temple Run 1 &amp; 2 and I honestly think this game is better, but I may be getting influenced by the fact it stars Iron Man. It runs smoothly and is addicting; the only bad side is it take up a lot of memory and that buying the other suits takes forever without using real money. Other than that though I recommend this game to anyone who lives endless runners... I mean &quot;flyers&quot; haha
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|it is scary that this is the free App of the day.  check the permissions and then read the reviews.  tons of fake reviews and the real reviews tell the story.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Bob Dylan did it again with this one. It's a real pleasure listening to Bob's raspy voice crooning out the latest in his immortal repertoire of songs that still delight after all these years. The old boy is still going strong!
B00932A4XE|5.0|Sooo Loved this movie....laughed until I almost peed.  Might have to buy this one! Gonna make the husband watch it tonight!
0061438294|3.0|A little too wordy, but in general good information.  The pictures were good.  I just seemed to get a little bored with some of the lengthy descriptions.
037571457X|1.0|While the book was fine, it was missing 40 pages in the middle.  Then there were repeat pages at the end of the book.  I have never had this happen in a book and it was completely annoying.
B002RT5SR2|4.0|Drama story with a start, middle, and end. Good actors. Production of movie very good for 1949. Enjoyed viewing real actors performing from real writer's script.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I was so involved in this game that I couldn't stop until I completed all 100 parts. It consumed all my free time. It was totally enjoyable and exciting.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|When I first started watching this I measured it against the British series &#34;Sherlock&#34; which meant I was immediately setting anything up for failure - that series is one of the best treatments of the Sherlock Holmes stories ever made.  What I found though was that this American series isn't competing.  It's not a cheap Americanized knock-off of a classic British endeavor.  They are two different approaches and both are well done.<br /><br />While &#34;Sherlock&#34; is more of a series of full-length movies with much more detailed plot-lines; &#34;Elementary&#34; is more bit-by-bit - a serialization if you will - of the story line.  There's enough in each episode to keep you really wanting more.  While it's not one big story broken up into chapters, it's a good example of authors who understand the original stories and are coming up with original material and modernizations of character development (e.g. Sherlock's drug addiction, a rational explanation as to why Watson doesn't practice medicine, a more intelligent and respectful attitude towards the police) while at the same time exploring some deep subjects - I won't give examples here as that gives away too much.<br /><br />If you enjoyed &#34;Sherlock&#34; both season 1 and 2, and you're a fan of the original stories, then give &#34;Elementary&#34; a chance to impress you with clever adaptations and oddly faithful tie-ins to the original stories.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My children are grown up now but we all still love the Disney Classics, especially this one. We have seen it so many times that we can quote the lines.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best game. We love all the different cities. Good for all ages. Very happy with the product . My kids cant wait to see what city is next.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game was great it entertained me hours at  a time. It was great graphics and the kids loved it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Never fails to make you laugh. Every episode something new. There is nothing else like it, love every one of there episodes.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The book is interesting enough but please know that even though Kathy Reich's is one of the producers of Bones, this Temperance Brennan bears no resemblance to the character of the same name on television.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was the best book of the trilogy. The story line was good with some spice instead of the other way around like the others were.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I was expecting this to be a mission type game but its more of a runner type game which is still AWESOME! What's not like you get to be IRON MAN. And build other suits? Yes you get to do that. Controls are tough to start with but once you get the hang of it your good to go. Great game get it!!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Lots of twists and turns and what a surprise at the end. Very entertaining and full of great characters. On to the next Harlan Coben book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series will draw you in, I found myself longing for the clothing and the ability to step back in time. The characters are masterfully chosen and the story line is fantastic. A very enjoyable way to spend an hour!
B008476HBM|5.0|One of the best novels of all time, and by far the best thing Austen ever wrote; so much so that it's hard to believe the same author penned her other boring, turgid books. Light, witty and entertaining as well as being a snapshot of her time and class, Pride and Prejudice is rightly hailed as a masterpiece.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I definitely did not see the ending coming. There were parts that described a bit much and lost my focus,but the bones ad meat of the story is very interesting and immersive.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Am enjoying this game, at least until it froze. But it loaded when I got in range of wireless. Great looking, fun and easy to play... Will continue as long as it doesn't require lots of money. We shall see.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a highly addictive game. Very fun to kill a lot of time with. The battles scenes are look pretty good as well.
0062014102|5.0|This is wow! I couldn't put it down. Maybe some people already read a few books about these subjects, but to me this is an eye opener. You don't have to belief all the author tell you but if you mind is open, then, please read it.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Very easy to use and read. Letters and numbers big enough so you have less chance of hitting incorrect key. Works well.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a nice temple run kind of game with the exception of getting to blow stuff up. Although the blasted currency needed to speed up upgrades and buy new suits is REAL MONEY. (You can use XP to buy new suits but you need a ton of it) This is. a very good game considering it's free. Get now.
0307744434|4.0|I'd probably give this 4.5 stars if I could.  It's not a perfect novel but the characters are vivid and the plot is solid.  I thoroughly enjoyed the circus environment and especially the variety of tents and performers.  Whatever flaws it might have, it was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  It reminds me somewhat of [[ASIN:0765356155 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: A Novel]].
B0063GORYU|5.0|enjoy can play 4 hours. love it. I would recommend. this game to anyone its a great card game to pass the time with
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The movie made no sense to me.  I tried getting into the movie but couldn't enjoy.  Rotten movie in my eyes.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved the character development by the author. It will be a book I will long remember.<br />I will recommend the book to all my friends and family that love to read as much as I do. I also<br />read &#34;Last Letter from your Lover&#34; and I liked it too but I thought &#34;Me Before You&#34; was better.<br />I LOVE the way this author writes!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the audible Bible! Great tool for those of us who are older &amp; not quite as good eyesight as we used to have.  Thank God for having this available to us.  Get this.  You will not regret it.
B008EEB4TA|4.0|this is one of my favorite CD's.  I love marina and this album is just so good.  It is a little different than her first CD and i like.  I personally love her music and this is just such a good CD.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|Enough said. What I use my phone is for me, not advertisers. Canceled install once I saw the permissions. Don't waste your time.
B00CATSONE|4.0|As a ardent fan of the greatest true genius in the past 200 years, Tesla, I enjoyed this book. The content is accurate and written in a concise and informative manner. The premise of &#34;imagination&#34; is interesting and provocative but I yearned for more of the science of Imagination. Overall, it is a nice read.
B00026WU7I|3.0|It is good but not really great. I always liked Dylan, he was unique and has his own style. Changed as time goes on.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is on my to read again list, and I just put it down!<br />Such a heart gripping book! You can't help but fall in love with Victoria.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|Expected more blues on this album. Heard sample track that I really like and thought all on his cuts on this would be more blues.<br />He still is good but would of liked it to be great.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What else is there to review. Kyle is a true hero along with Dakota Meyer, Marcus Luttrell, Salvatore Giunta, Sgt. Romesha, Mike Murphy and every soldier, sailor and Marine who served their country.  Thank you very much for your outstanding dedication to god, country and family.  Outstanding book, outstanding service.<br /><br />Badbob<br />USMC
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was hilarious and cute. I'm usually not a fan of kids movies but this one was pretty good.
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's memoir Wild is searing, honest, and compelling. Her mother's death when Cheryl is twenty-two leaves an emotional burn mark that leads Cheryl to choose a life filled with reckless, wounding choices from casual sex to shooting up heroin with an addict boyfriend.  The choice to walk the Pacific Coast Trail also appears reckless, impulsive, and a decision that could easily leave Cheryl dead or traumatized. Her walk begins in the suffocating heat of the Mojave and ends in the cool balm of Oregon's wilderness. Along the way Cheryl reveals her deepest hurts, a father who despised and abandoned her, a step-dad who had shown love while her mother lived but, when her mom died, chose rejection and abandonment.<br />In clear prose and evocative words the author owns her choices without special pleading or self-pity. The PCT began a process that allowed Cheryl to see her choices not as either good or bad, but simply as sign posts along the road she had traveled. She learned not to pummel herself for being herself and found a resilience that can only be tapped when someone has walked through an enormous challenge and come out on the other side. At the end of the journey, she is changed.
B000YI7MRM|3.0|I agree with the previous reviews that it is filmed very well but they tried to cram too much into one movie. Visually this is a very good movie. Good action, filmed very well. Unfortunately the movie is very disjointed and jumps all over the place. There is no flow and no real character development. It can be very hard to follow if you haven't read the books. The books are great and I highly recommend them. Unfortunately if you haven't read them the film will make absolutely no sense. If you've read the books you will have some empathy for the characters and have a vague idea of what's going on. Unfortunately the movie seems to have jumped over 4 to 5 books that do all of the character development.  Being so disjointed some of the scenes and action make no sense. You get the feeling that something may have happened previously that results in the scene you're watching but have no idea what it was. I now realize why the film wasn't released in the US. It's entertaining for the fans who have read the books(but still hard to follow). If you haven't read them you'll be so lost and the story will make so little sense you'll think the people who made the movie had no idea what they were doing. They should have stuck to just making a film about the first one or two books instead of cramming all the books into one movie. Especially since not all of the books have been released in the US yet. If you haven't read the books don't buy this movie. Even if you have read the books translated into English you may want to pass on this film. Most of the movie won't make sense and it kind of ruins the potential of reading the books that haven't been translated into English yet. If the film is accurate in the way things end it makes reading the rest of the books somewhat pointless and is something of a letdown.
B005ZCXFD2|5.0|Great fun. Nice mix of horror, scifi, and comedy, a bunch of juvenile delinquents, stoners and a lovely nurse fight off alien hellhounds in a projects building.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Nice...I like the look and feel of it and it is quite easy to navigate. No problems discovered yet. Nice...
B004UHL9EK|3.0|I got this without checking it out completely. To me the alarm clock is better for me. I am removing it from my kindle
0802473156|5.0|This book is amazing! It is such an eye opener. It made me take a really good look at myself. I will forever be changed. I will continue to go back and read this book to keep myself in a good place. I tell everyone I come into contact with that they must read this book.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Surprised at Jennifer Lawrence's win.  Thought Bradley Cooper held down the film a lot better than her... the parents as well.
1250012570|5.0|I fell in love with Rainbow Rowell's writing and characters in Attachments and the love affair continues with Eleanor & Park. Her ability to capture the feeling of being in love in this book is unlike any other author I've read in recent times. The care she takes in describing her characters and their emotions and senses is just brilliant. This is a book that is going to stay with me for months and years to come. I suppose I understand why it's a YA novel given that her lead characters are in 10th grade, but it tugged at the heart strings of this 41 year old (E & P are in 10th grade in the 80s which is when I was in the 10th grade so I suppose that made it even more relatable!)  I cannot wait for her next book!
0375869026|5.0|Wonderful treatise on bullying and the motivations that often power it. My favorite character was a minor one, the principal of the school as he held his ground against parents who were trying to run his show for him.  The other part I loved is how well defined each character is, with both their inner angles and devils exposed. Even with most people trying to be their best most of them time, there is plenty of conflict to keep you turning the pages.
1582701709|5.0|We are reminded once more of the oldest Truth in the Universe.  That we are responsible for creating our own reality is something we either suspect or know.  Old habits die hard it is said, and sadly this is true but Universal truth is there waiting for our enlightenment and strength to implement. Being first and foremost a book person.  I like to write in the front and back pages, along the margins and place multiple book marks to quickly access a special passage or quote. It becomes mine in all ways and much like a journal.  I strongly recommend this as a personal reminder and gift for all occasions..
B00B69UQEO|5.0|It just doesn't get any better from one of the most consistent bands of our times. I think the first 4 tracks of this album are outstanding and I can't wait to hear them played live.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's easy to understand and play.  My kids love playing this game and their ages run from 4-6 years old
B00125WAWS|5.0|A reminder of the difficulties some folks have faced, and overcome with hard work and determination.  A must-see for young people who have no idea how Negroes lived in the south, and what they had to contend with.  Great performances by the stars.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Nothing more than I can say but everyone should watch this compelling story of true survival.<br />I was slightly disappointed that I never found out what happend with that little noy Dilan.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love Yahoo! Mail on my kindle!  I also like the fact that it lets me know when I have mail.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun I love this game I hope we go all over the world I don't have nothing else to say about this game
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is amazing the ending will get to you... I was so shocked even though I was forced to read this I'm glad I did!!!
0545265355|4.0|Here I am wanting to reread The Hunger Games and moving on to Catching Fire before the movie comes out and what do I find but a nice price for the complete, hardcover box set of the it trilogy. Heck to the yeah! To me there is nothing better than buying a physical book to leaf through and to get Collins' creation in my hands for such a great deal leaves me pretty much satisfied about my purchase.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very simple. You get to be creative and very easy to operate. ! I play this with my daughter.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I had the same pair of heahones for the last 19 years and they have always worked good until recently the right side wasn't working anymore. I thought it was time to replace them and with as good of luck as I had had with the previous pair I thought I would get the same pair again. I always thought the old ones sounded good but the new pair sounds even better. I use these for live audio mixing and would recommend them to others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!I love playing this game.I also enjoy the new place (Tokyo).I like all the different colors added to the game.The colors make the game much more fun to play!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A wondefully imagined story about post apocalyptic planet Earth. Read how life has changed, but you will find that some aspects of living haven't. You won't be disappointed.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I enjoyed the presentations of the selected groups for this film. The selections are varied and touch on all areas of music genre.
B00B6SI7TG|4.0|This is not my favorite song from the album by any means.  I kinda questioned the decision to use this as the first track released as a single from the new album.  But hey
0143106333|5.0|Charlie Bucket is that quintessentially Roald Dahl hero: vulnerable, trapped by circumstance, thrust into the limelight for a task he seems completely ill-suited to face, yet triumphant because of his innate goodness.<br /><br />Far from a morality tale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is like a weird story told by your favorite aunt or uncle, which at first seems to be a story of luck, but turns out to be everyone's story: a tale about growing from a child to an adult.<br /><br />Dahl has a terrific sense of pacing and plot. He starts with a couple of sentences on each page. Here are Charlie's ancient grandparents---so old that they take up barely a few wrinkly scratches for illustration. Here are his well-meaning, blank-faced parents, with bland and innocent expressions. Here's Charlie--- disheveled hair, straight nose, simple garments, a hopeful smile. That's it for the first three pages. Many commenters say they hate Quentin Blake's drawings. So did I---at first. They seem sloppy and careless; to a non-artist's eyes, they seem unflattering, ugly. You won't find Disney-like or manga-esque outsized cartoon eyes or cherubic cheeks here. Eyes are simple dots, the mouths, a slash. Smiles are full of grotesque teeth. Noses are angled like guns. However, Blake illustrated almost all of Dahl's books, and they are perfect to Dahl's quirky, subversive temperament. They address the question of assumptions. They are exactly right for Dahl because they are exactly right for children. Children have not learned to expect the conventional kind of beauty, or to judge the unbeautiful. They have an open mind.<br /><br />The liberal and searching mind is the perfect vessel for Dahl's stories of strange appetites, reversing fortunes, quixotic authority, outsized talents, unreasonable demands, and responsibility.  Many have summarized the plot, and I won't go into it in detail.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that we can now buy inferior teeth-breaking Willy Wonka candy in our grocerystores. Loses a bit of magic, doesn't it?<br /><br />When I first read Chocolate Factory, years ago, years before seeing any demented movie adaptations, the \\"golden ticket\\" was like a combination of the best amusement parks and the most fabulous candy, the Holy Grail of tickets. Charlie was our representative to this world. He was all of us: decent. happy-go-lucky, appreciative, thrifty, respectful, and timid. Bullied and timid. That such an adventure could lift Charlie (and his funny Grandpa Joe, who turned out to be more than just a million wrinkles shivering in a cold bed) gave every child his own hope. He didn't have to be as greedy as Augustus, or as rich as Verruca, or as demanding as Violet, or as violent as Mike Teevee. He didn't have to parrot any of those bad adult behaviors. He could continue to have childish goodness and safely grow up.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!! This is the second book that continued my interest in Tom Clancy novels. Great Jack Ryan series book.
B003Y6GJD4|2.0|This movie looked really good from preview but was very slow. It had a few exciting parts but otherwise was kind of boring.
0440237688|5.0|Bought this book for my sons class, and he enjoyed reading it. did well in his class. better if it was e-book.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Larson was a great storyteller but he didn't put nearly as much into Book 3 of this trilogy as he did into Book 1.  Maybe he was becoming bored ... I know I was.  This book did not really get moving until the last third.  If I had not been so invested in the characters' fates from having read Books 1 & 2, I would have given up on Book 3 before the halfway mark.
0553296981|5.0|Bought this book for my sons class, and he enjoyed reading it. did well in his class. better if it was e-book.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Bought season 7 yesterday and am half way through. Excellent season so far.  Dexter juggles multiple tight situations at once. All the actors do an amazing job.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book is perfect. Helped in my course of studies and took some insightful advice. Recommend for dealing with people and even trying to read your kids.
B001NLKT60|3.0|If it wasn't for the irritating politics of the author, I would have  given this four stars. Once the bleeding heart stopped, the story was clever. The story meandered. The first third of the book wasn't necessary. If you get through it, it's worth it.
B000FA5QEK|5.0|Love this book. I heard of it from Will Smith on Oprah, saying he used this book with his son. There are a lot of interesting things and advice that I took from this book.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Love the series. Holds the viewers interest. Best spent money. Will rewatch again.I like being able to enjoy with no commercials. Enjoy the cast of actors.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Bought these books so my son and I would have discussion before the second movie came out. We enjoyed the movie and compared the book version. Very good read and he has read them all. I'm still on the second book.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It' won't allow me to look at e-mails that are in my &#34;Sent&#34; folder, but does an OK job with 'Inbox' emails.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Highly recommend this app to all!! You can setup your own newsboards of all types. You can also set ratings to the pages you scoll through. The little animations on the Kindle Fire HD add to the experience.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Great animation and very creative. Lines were good. Could have been a little funnier. But all around a good family movie!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|These are the best cables I found that were good and did not cost me too much to purchase. Great.
0385349947|5.0|I know people always say that, but I usually hate leadership books. I read an excerpt of this one and then had to buy it. I couldn't put it down. Smart, witty, and overall practical. I haven't heard such common sense in YEARS.
0812983459|4.0|Harold and his wife were going through the motions of continuing their marriage, but it was going to take a jolt of some kind to make them realize they loved and needed each other. Harold's journey on foot to visit a dying friend hundreds of miles away unexpectedly provided that jolt. His self realizations along the way paralleled his wife's back home. The last part of Harold's journey was, I thought, uneven and a bit disappointing, but the end of the tale satisfies the reader. If you are familiar with the countryside, and if you enjoy introspection, this book will hold your interest.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed One foot in the Grave. I think this series is shaking out to be the literary equivalent of a big, honking piece of chocolate cake. Sure it's never going to expand anyone's IQ and it makes no pretense at realism (or at as much realism as a story about vampires and ghouls could hope for, that is); but it is wondrously, satisfyingly FUN!!<br /><br />I thought OFITG was a very strong follow up and I enjoyed it more than Halfway to the Grave. I liked the way Cat's character developed, it was nice to see her mature and I enjoyed seeing her finally stand up for herself with her mother, her \\"boss\\" and co-workers. There was the usual witty dialogue; and the scene with Bones and Cat's mother was hysterical.<br /><br />In OFITG we got to learn a bit more about Bones' background; however I'm still not entirely clear on how and why he fell for Cat so hard and so quickly...but then at times, such is real life. There is nothing to dislike about Bones. The intensity of his love, devotion and loyalty to Cat is a pleasure to behold. (And he still reminds me of another platinum blond, British and equally besotted someone).<br /><br />I enjoyed the storyline as evidenced by the fact that on 2 occasions I could not put the book down and kept reading to find out what was going to happen, when I clearly had other and more important tasks demanding my attention. I can't wait to dig into book 3!
B003RV43X4|3.0|this movie is very mediocre.<br />boring computer effects one after the other.<br />give me the original version any day.<br />i missed the robot owl.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app is better than every other app I've tried, including teamviewer and VNC. being free for download was just the icing on the cake.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is sort of like temple run....... except funner......... I really enjoy this game and plus it is free... so you don't lose anything if you dont like it all you have to do is delete it and you wont lose any money...... and it is really worth trying if you do like temple run cause this game is better then temple run...... the worst thing that can happen is that you don't like it and you delete it...... and the best thing that could happen is that you might like it and how will you know that if you aren't going to try it. so I recommend this game to everybody.(kids 3+ and adults 18-130 years old)
B00BZOD63S|2.0|Story had lots of loose ends to the point where i had to go online to understand how everything was supposed to tie together
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The saga continues, the characters are warm, funny, insightful. We enjoyed Season 2 very much. This is a show we highly recommend.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|it says it takes up 1.85 gbs of space but kindles dont have 1.85 gbs worth of space in the applicatioj section im just waying that it would require us to delete all other apps but other wise i have beat this game 10 times and it never gets old
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is an exceptional show, the cast is superb, the continuing saga is intriguing, interesting, and laugh out loud fun..
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|Days Boot has become one of the classics that has to be included in any good collection of war movies. The only reason I'm not giving top rating is the sound quality for the Amazon Prime streaming video versio - it could be better.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Quite literally, there is nothing surprising about this film,  except that I watched it against my own misgivings.<br /><br />That's not to say it's bad. It's not.<br /><br />But it's just not great, or memorable, in any sense other than anyone who sees it probably could have written it, if they were supplied with the premise.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|A must have one of the best series I have seen that is a can't wait tell next one comes out.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Pretty handy if you use your device a lot. Works great on my kindle fire HD. Would recommend to anyone.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|great game nothing bad about it.  if you have a little nemo fan in your house he or she will love this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|While the plot isn't necessarily tight, the characters are fairly well written and the acting is good which keeps the series going. I only hope they will end it before it fizzles out like so many american shows.
0307272702|5.0|This is a very resourceful book.  I even lent it to my doctor.  Unlike most diet books, it explains how and why our bodies react to different foods.<br /><br />My girth presently reminds me..........Gosh!.......time to read it again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put any of these books down. Loved the ending, thanks for all the ups and downs. They made the book all that much better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|2 yrs. ago, I heard the author giving an interview to Terry Gross on NPR' s Fresh Air. I decided on that day, that I would read the book that they were discussing one day. I found that it was a great book with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. I had a tough time putting it down. The end is a great treat that anyone who enjoys mysteries or thriller's should not miss!! A smart great book to pick up. Perfect for summer or beach reading.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Excellent story with lots of twists and turns, loved the storyline with Bosch and his daughter. Enjoyed the play between partners
B008FPOIT6|5.0|First, let me say I an undoubtedly NOT Robin Sloan's intended audience, being an aging librarian-type; so old in fact, I remember hole-in-the-wall bookstores just as Mr. Penumbra's appears to be.  But once inside Penumbra, what fun!  I went in because it purported to be a bookstore, had to share the book with my husband because it was sort-of sci-fi, then with my son because it was high tech sci-fi, and strangers on the street, just because it was such a fun read.  Then found Annabel Scheme.  Please write more, Mr Sloan!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Alas never a season two to be. While I was glad for Serrinity there was so much more story to tell.
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson spins a tale so entertaining that you may forget that this is a non-fiction biography.  This book lays out in painful honesty the life of a man who changed the course of human history, the founder of Apple Computer, Steve Jobs. If you are looking for a character-driven book, or even a novel, this is the book for you. Isaacson weaves a story (a true one, too) of a larger-than-life character - passionate, mean, emotional, and a cry-baby, too - who has changed all of our lives. The detail in the book is unmatched, to such a degree that you cannot help but locate yourself somewhere in its history (\\"Where was I in 1984 when...?\\"). No matter where you entered the computing scene, somewhere Steve Jobs has influenced your experience with the personal computer, the cell phone, or the laptop. In addition, the setting of \\"Apple Computer\\" in California almost takes on a character of its own, as the center of technology and an almost religious mecca for all who worship at the altar of the user-friendly iPhone/iPad. In the end, one cannot help but respect the man who created all of this, even if he was a \\"mean girl,\\" for, who else, but a man to be respected, would authorize the writing of his biography and allow the author unfettered access and the ability to tell the truth as he sees it, even if the truth is completely unflattering! - Review by Robert Chrystal, M.L.S.
1401235425|5.0|I liked it so much, I'm planning on buying every issue. A fresh and entertaining style, that once picked up, I could not put it down until finished.
0425252868|5.0|Great stories of WWII and the B17 Flying Fortress. This book gives you great insights as to what it was like flying the skies in WWII. It is a must read for B-17 enthusiasts.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|What was most unique is that the actors who were selected to play the young and then the older brothers were so well cast that it was truly like they were the grown up brothers (other than one being circumcised and the other not). Exceptional story and exceptional acting. I believe that one day i just might purchase it.
1452113432|5.0|When I first learned of Rachel Choo it was on a cooking show and I became hooked watching her cook in her tiny little kitchen. Love that she cooks French recipes and makes them her own. Her Lavender & Honey Chicken is worth the book alone. But so many great recipes to try. I am having fun going through her book and deciding what to try next. If you ever wanted to try French Cooking but were intimated you have to give this book a try. You will not be sorry when it's in your library
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is a thought provoking game with a music and art style that combines to create an incredibly moving story line, all without the use of any text or language.<br /><br />Even if this had been 60$, I would not have regretted the purchase.
B00BYH6MZK|3.0|Considering the big names in this, I expected more from it. It was at times rather slow and I was disappointed. Big fan of both actors but this should have been better. It's a good rental. Glad I didn't pay top dollar at the box office
B003XDZN8A|5.0|My sister says these shoes, which I got for her to wear at work where she's on her feet for long shifts, are &#34;like walking on a trampoline - and I mean that in a GOOD way.&#34; She loves them. She has a high arch but the strap is no problem for her, and her foot is on the wide side, but these are roomy enough.
B0033AX1YG|5.0|I haven't made it through both DVD's yet, but what I have seen so far is great!  (The CD is very good, too.)  Gary Moore wasn't just another guitar player- his guitar was an extension of himself.  This was a man who felt every note that he played in his soul.  This is some great music on a set of 2 DVD's and 1 CD that deserves to be in everyone's collection.  Watching Gary through the years is amazing, and the camera work is very good.  There are lots of close-ups to let you see how he's playing his guitar, how he's getting tones out of it, and how he made his distinctive sound.  There are 39 live performances, and no songs are repeated!  What a great collection of his live performances!  I don't know how anyone could call themselves a fan of Gary Moore, and not have this in their collection.
B009R659L8|3.0|This was an OK read, however not up to Mary Higgins Clark usual page turner.  However, I will read any thing that she writes.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had to delete it from my Kindle. It is so graphic. I don't need a porn movie or magazine. It is plain and simply PORNOGRAPHY.<br />I would rate it adult porn  XXX. To think that women are buying this book and the thought of their kids getting ahold of it and reading it is so alarming to me. And to think they are going to make a movie about it just proves how much our standards have lowered as a society.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It made getting Yahoo mail easy on my Kindle.  It allows me to automatically connect with my Yahoo mail wherever I can find an available wireless connection.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! I can't wait for the final book! What else will he do for her! Can't wait to find out.
B002RPR6DU|5.0|This is such a great movie. I remember it from my childhood, very touching. The whole premise of the movie, knowing that what is being protected is everything essential to earth, the beauty of nature and wonder of the seasons, food sources, the great outdoors, plant life from all areas in the world, etc.. All being kept alive and protected in one place only the space station, to be returned to earth when earth is ready to re-introduce it to our world.<br /><br />I think that Bruce Dern is absolutely wonderful in this film and I would highly recommend this to others.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed watching this series. Its is different. Strong plot, engaging characters. It is able to maintain the right amount of mystery and suspense.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|what can I say we all wish we had a Christian Grey to call our own .. what a man but for now mine will do me just fine...
B009R659L8|4.0|This book is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best!  I wish she would write a new one every year.  I have all of her books to date, and have re-read them several times.  Thanks Mary, for coming back into my life!  Good work!
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|Pitbull is my man wow got to love his music yea yea yea keep dropping the Cd's and I will keep buying them Love Pitbull ....
B004ADH1RI|5.0|One of the best childhood movies I remember. I still love it, and know it by heart. It's fun to watch it with my daughter and see her enjoy it as much as I did at her age. All time classic!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Yes  2 hours  of a guy who drinks to much. Rock bottom would have been better title.. Or Don't fly drunk..
0385367783|4.0|Intriguing publication.I enjoyed reading this book. Great for reading at night to relax before going to bed.Would recommend this to my friends.
B0015AARJI|5.0|No problems at all fast shipping and handling now i can play NBA 2k13 without any difficulties and become a legend in the game
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is really fun and keeps me entertainedfor hours! I love it! You do not need to pay like some reviews state.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|This is full of good solid information for those who are interested in Home base business.If you are Marketing he will gave you the push to continue on.
B0098VXDDS|5.0|bought the first season from Amazon and i am digitally purchasing the 2nd season from Amazon and keeping in my Video Library through use of my Roku Box..one of the best series i have watched and look forward to buying season 3 as well.
B0083Z614S|5.0|With terrific narration this classical story comments alive and fills your heart and soul with childlike wonder. It should be read or 're read by anyone wanting to experience the joy of nature and the innocence of childhood . It lifts the spirit in a simple to understand way. Don't forget the narration.. it's well worth the extra small cost.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Often feel like taking off on a walking adventure!  Love this story!  Twists and turns and surprises that were not expected.  Good read!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Very entertaining.  I remember watching the original movie as a little kid and was greatly amused by the character names and plot lines that they took from the old movie with Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis.  This is like chapter two 60 years later.  Great action, great insight into human behavior, and sympathetic characters.  Doesn't insult your intelligence too much like many of these type programs do.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|its a really fun game with a great story line. I had a lot of fun playing it. it could have been more challenging though.
0374214913|2.0|My book club chose this book because of the somewhat unusual setting.  We were disappointed in the plot line -  it never seemed to go anywhere.  The characters were not well developed, either.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|These episodes of Dr. Who are epic! If you are a &#34;Whovian&#34; this season will be a joy! Check them out for yourself!
B004P68T30|5.0|The app was easy enough for my 4 year old to navigate too and use.  Great way to keep your kid occupied for 10 minutes or so.
0060245867|5.0|Love it! Thank you, fast shipping and delite to add to my kids collection! The book was in great condition, can't wait to use it
1476734941|5.0|I bought this book for my sister (age 64) b/c she was steadily gaining weight over the last few years and feeling miserable about it.  I heard the author, Dr. Michael Mosely, on NPR talk about the fasting program so I thought I would check this out for my sister.  After reading it (in just 1 evening), I was impressed with the research and I then sent the book to my sister (I live in NC; she lives in Fla).  She began the program immediately and in 2 months she tells me she has lost 11 lbs. and is feeling so much better.  She doesn't feel at all deprived by the fasting regime.  I can't wait to see her.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Love the game but have nothing but trouble with it when trying to play on my kindle or android phone.  Very frustrating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is pure awesomeness, everything is made of blocks also u could do anything u want ! I prefer minecraft pc
B007N8RULO|4.0|its fun , it keeps me busy when I'm waiting for appointments ,and makes time go by faster keeps my mind busy
B0055SWM08|5.0|amazing game. hours of fun and sweet torture. lots of challenging levels. I had to use hint a couple of times :)
B00BESM14U|5.0|loved it it was wicked excellent.  good acting and very likeable characters.  Dealt with difficult issues - something to think about.
B0025KVLUG|4.0|Although this album is regarded as part of the Beatles canon, to be brutally honest calling it a Beatles album is stretching the truth. There are 6 songs by The Beatles, of which two (the Lennon/McCartney-penned Ringo singalong 'Yellow Submarine'and John's 'All You Need Is Love') were being released for the third separate time- each had been released as a single and also on an album, YS on 'Revolver' and AYNIL on 'Magical Mystery Tour'.<br /><br />Moreover, the second half of the album is not The Beatles at all but a set of George Martin orchestral pieces. They are pleasant enough, but they have very little to do with The Beatles, with the exception of 'Yellow Submarine In Pepperland' which is based on the Lennon/McCartney song (making the 4th release of YS!).<br /><br />So this is really a review of four songs, two of them by Harrison, meaning that on this album George has as many new songs as John and Paul! I like the two Harrison songs, although they are neither innovative nor complex. Both were recorded in early 1967, two years before the release of the film and this album. 'Only A Northern Song' is a rather bitter rant by George about his songwriting for The Beatles and their publishers, Northern Songs. 'It's All Too Much' is a lengthy (6.28) piece of psychedelia which lyrically betrays its links to 'Sgt. Pepper', being written at the time that album was being recorded.<br /><br />Lennon's 'Hey Bulldog' is a good rocker, built around a piano riff but featuring excellent instrumental work by all the band and a throwback vocal from John. He could still belt it out when he chose! 'All Together Now' is a Paul singalong, often dismissed as lightweight, which indeed it is, but catchy and fun nevertheless.<br /><br />I like the 'Yellow Submarine' album and I own it, but there's just not enough of The Beatles to merit 5 stars. If you already own everything else The Beatles released, as I do, then you'll want this to complete your collection. If you are just getting toknow The Beatles (and a whole new generation is doing just that), I suggest you get all the other albums first, including Past Masters 1 and 2.<br /><br />Then you will see there's a hole in your collection and you can get this one.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have read all of Nesbo's Harry Hole books and the Phanton is by far the best one.  It has a great plot, great characters and relentless action.  Absolutely grat writing.  My only complaint is that I stayed up until 3 a.m. to finish it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I like all the Bond movies. I thought SkyFall was right up there among the best in plot, acting, dialogue and stunt scenes.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|The game is awesome to play. I have enjoyed it very much and would recommend this product to everyone. It has been a pleasure to play.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Can't stop playing this game!! You can create your own colorful fish tanks and fill them with all species of fish.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I liked this movie and thought overall it was well done, but there were a few things I didn't like so much.<br />1. The fact that nearly every line was sung was a little weird for me<br />2. I thought they could have left out the semi-explicit scene when Fantine is a harlot (not necessary to portray how bad her estate was at that point- I got the picture without that scene)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So this game is like temple run but with a kick and its  t more entertaining with the trains and he characters really great game for kids and even when you get bored it's great.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is one of the greatest animated films ever made.  The plot is wonderful; the music is amazing, and by the end of the story you are left with that warm, happy feeling that you just can't find anywhere except from a Disney classic!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is just amazing it is like a mix of temple run and the new game skylanders<br />I wish it came out a long long time ago
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like subway surfers. I like the new key thing so if you mess up you can start from the same spot again. If you don't have this game you should get it now. Amazon did a good job of getting it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome but I can't believe it cost $6.99 you can build lots of stuff and I think they should up date it more in creative mode they have TNT but no flint and steal if they have it then all of us could go to the neither for a tip add more blocks mobs even horses  and lava I bet more people would play this make it like the PC version now buy the game it's awesome
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book series EVER!!!!!!!!! Good for older kids or teens. The end of the Quarter quell really surprised me. And I love the ending. Oh who am I kidding I LOVE THE WHOLE SERIES!!!!! I was sad when I finished it, I wanted to keep reading :p<br />So anyway... if you like intense, kinda scary, or romantic books,, or if you like any kind of book..... read Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
B003XVYLDU|1.0|I have read a lot of books that fall under multiple genres and this is the WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. It doesn't make sense, the plot is stupid and it is a waste of time. HORRIBLE!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like facebook it helps me stay in tact with my friends who i dont have thier phone number or dont have a phone
B00884GR0W|5.0|wait they made a BIG mistake on the app. in the video trailer that sword is the same sword in a game I play called ROBLOX big big mistake :/
B007TK77QE|2.0|I felt this book needed harsh editing to make it more readable.  Too many characters with nick names which became confusing and the story much too long before arriving at the catalyst and conclusion.
1932100660|1.0|This book is more about marketing Mr. Campbell's diet advice empire than it is about providing balanced, science based guidance for healthy eating given today's choices. I would suggest T. Colin Campbell publish this book along with his methods and data that he feels support it in a peer reviewed journal rather than a mass market non-peer reviewed paperback. It is quite possible though that in it's current form, many professional epidemiologists would feel strongly that the Mr. Campbell's work would not be accepted for publication. I would concur.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Love That It Can Play Music From Your Phone. I Would Download It. The Math Questions Are Cool Too Go From Easy To Really Hard And Will Wake You Up
B007FKI9G0|5.0|Yes, it's a &#34;Mock-umentary&#34;. But a) it's quite funny, b) the songs distill everything about 60's and 70's music in a way that's hilarious if you lived through those eras and their music, and c) the dynamics of how the band acts and reacts with each other and the music industry are quite recognizable to anybody who's ever been in the industry. And no, &#34;Stonehenge&#34; was not modeled after Black Sabbath's &#34;Stonehenge&#34;, apparently Meathead and BS came up with the idea simultaneously since the movie was released the same year as Black Sabbath's &#34;Stonehenge&#34; set design disaster and had been shot well before that disaster. Just goes to show that sometimes art predicts real life rather than depicts it :).
B00992CF6W|1.0|yo you need ta get this games bro it will chang your life<br /> promis dude you will love this game zombies, creepers, skelotons with bows<br />AMAZING!!!!<br /><br />creepers get on my nervers some times!<br />I built 58 cozzy cabbens in survival!!!<br />I don't what ells to right about bro
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Jacob and his family struggle every day with different sets of challenges, emotions, and in the end, enormous consequences. Mr Landay weaves a tangled web that leaves you hoping from the very beginning of the book. Is there much to be learned from this set of circumstances? Perhaps but I know I will probably be retracing every page to look for a few answers to the clues.  Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|please someone e help me. I do like this game though. its pretty fun not as fun as pc but still good
B0016492BW|5.0|If you loved this picture originally, and you're interested in background info, get this. Gilliam is hilarious and frank in his assessments. The picture quality is very very good, and the surround sound is awesome too. I disagree with Mr. Gilliam, in that many people will find this upgrade worthwhile. Yes, it is old material, and the methods are dated and/or simplistic. But that is much of the charm. And now you can notice it all in high definition!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I bought this game I love it so MUCH that I have been playing it every day Buy this app
B0085W6II8|4.0|I loved the first (anthemic) song, and Chris' song about Aliens. The others required more listening. At this point, after a couple months, I'd say all the compositions are strong except for the next to last strong doesn't appeal to me as much as the rest (but it's still good).
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The collaboration between Robert Jordan's partial work done before his passing and the completion of the final three books by Brandon Sanderson was seamless. A Memory of Light is a strong ending to an excellent Epic Fantasy Series.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|love the effects an animation etc.  kool  game<br />my grandson played it over and over.. kept him busy a lot
B008K8VDPU|1.0|If this is only for phones , why did it let me buy it for my kindle? am i missing something?
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|Loved all the ip man movies! This is the beginning movie and shows how Ip Man all started. If you're into movies like fighting asian style this movie I think you would enjoy!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Interesting structure, cool story, fun characters. Vampire chase.Worth a read. Told in a series of diary entries, newspaper articles, phonograph recordings. Folklore. Eastern Europe. Victorian England
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and addicting. You can try to beat your own scores or you can play against your Facebook friends. I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Builds to a crescendo that is expected but not expected.  The writing is well done and you end up hating the character you thought you would love and actually feeling some compassion for the character you thought you wouldn't
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A magnificent collection of real musician retirees join Pauline Collins, Bilie Connolly, and over acting Michael Gambon, who help Maggie Smith and Tom Courtney to make this directorial debut of Dustin Hoffman memorable.  Heck, see this movie for the house. The house reflects every relationship beautifully. The four acts and the four major characters match Ron Harwood  script, photography, music and direction superbly. Do not miss this gem. It is almost  as good as Noel Coward's \\"Waiting in the Wings\\". which deserves  to be filmed too.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost season 4 is just as exciting as the first three seasons. I couldn't wait to watch all the seasons.
B00AEFXN46|5.0|The color is beautiful as the format is in blue ray region A than the previous DVD region 1 format
B003ASLJK4|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Sweet love story and tear jerker. With that cast you can't go wrong!!
B007RCJNDE|3.0|Not awful, just nowhere near terrific. Rand's extended thought processes while mentally battling the big bad guy are just not that exciting. A must-read for anyone who has stuck with the series to this point, but don't expect to be mesmerised, it was more like finishing the washing up, it just had to be done.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game in the whole huge gigantic world!!!  I will dedicate my life to it.  The world will be a better place.  May peace prevail!
B005HSL626|5.0|Love this game. It loaded quickly and was easy to download. Fun to play when I am home alone and bored.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We heard about this movie from friends.  We were pleasantly surprised  and really enjoyed the movie.  The scenery was great.  Every one should see it!
B009MFKO3M|3.0|Some catchy songs, But not enough to get the whole album into heavy rotation on my stereo. Good shuffle fodder.
140053271X|5.0|With all the weekly magazines going digital, this is a nice device for use when reading magazines along with breakfast.  Works great with books too!!
1451678193|5.0|I have never been able to get into sci-fi, but I read this book and fell in love.  Bradbury made Mars a familiar place and included so many aspects of American life--literature, art, science/nature, love, family--in the plot.  I especially love the chapter/story &#34;Usher II&#34; that puts a twist on many of Poe's stories to discuss censorship.  I loved this book so much that I assigned it to my developmental English class, and all of my students loved it, too.  Students who hadn't finished a book in years were raving about how much they enjoyed the stories.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Very good movie, but also very intense.  Difficult to watch at times.  May be too intense for young children to watch.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a very good hidden object adventure game. It was not too difficult, but also not too easy. It has many puzzles to solve and a good story line. Looking forward to the second part.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|DCI Banks is close to Beck. If you liked Beck, then try this one and you will not be disappointed.<br />Headhunters is so unexpected! You have to be patient with the development and do not try to guess. As I said, it's unexpected.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show was put together very well. The details are great, I really enjoyed watching this episode! I intend on watching the following episode and hopefully more in the future.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is difficult to put down.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will smile, and you will weep. It is masterfully written with sensitivity and kindness.  Thank you Markus Zusak.<br />.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Interesting perspective that spoke to me on many levels. I finished the book feeling refreshed and invigorated and a little less alone in my life-work experience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love it i also have it on xbox 360. it consumes most of my time when i let it i love building things and designing them my way its great
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Call Of Duty is better but this game will do for now. Best game on the kindle so far so good.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|When I saw the previews, I was expecting pure comedy. I didn't expect to need a Kleenex. But I loved how it shows how we are really alike in our insecurities and are just too afraid to say them out loud. Good movie!
B004UXY5D6|5.0|Never hear of this band and came across it in the recommended music for me. If you like southern rock with country, you need to check this out. My best music purchase this year.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Not for those that have short attention spans but for those who also love detail. Almost infuriating at the level of death amongst those who could be a favorite. Always a joy when a hated for goes!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cooler then temple run 2 I can play it forever my only problem is that why does every game need to be connected to Facebook why can't u play in piece instead of playing on Facebook
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is such a cute movie.  I loved it.  Children will love this one!  I watched it tiwce.  Thanks a lot.

B00511ONPG|4.0|Social media is changing quite fast, however the author did try to keep this book up to date with many of the most popular social media platforms out there.<br /><br />Facebook was covered prominently in the book but it is not only about Facebook but social media in general.<br /><br />Just like the title says \\"Likeable social media\\", the key to success is to be likeable. With common sense and great case studies, the author highlighted why being likeable in the new age of social media is crucial and what you should do to become likeable.<br /><br />Well as it turns out, to become likeable on social media is not that different from being likeable in offline environment (real life). May be one key difference is that every person is much more powered by social media to share, to express his/her view than ever before.<br /><br />Check out united break guitars to understand how a mistake could lower the stock price of the company by 10% and shareholder lost $180M in the process. [...]<br /><br />18 principles were discussed in the book. I summarised them into about 12 principles, combining some of them together. With each principle, the author gave an action item list which is perfect for those who are looking for hands on advice. You may need to tweak it a bit to apply them in your specific circumstances and again use common sense, but I think the principles are highly applicable and specific enough.<br /><br />After reading the book, you may say that not all of these principles are applicable in Vietnam especially when it comes to transparency and how to respond to bad comments on social media. Well on that note, I think human being wants to be treated nicely everywhere and when we get upset, our behaviour is pretty much the same everywhere as well. We complain. The more we upset, the harder we complain and deleting or ignoring the issue is not a good option. Answering bad comments publicly and then handle them privately is one of the best way and I agree with the author on that front.
B00985E3UG|5.0|We have to educate ourselves about the food we eat. This book provides great insight into the food industry and its  contribution to our national health crisis of obesity. Processed foods have become a way of life. How much influence does marketing have on our daily choices. The food industry wats to provide what consumers want. As consumers do we actually want what we are eating? At the very least we owe it to ourselves, our children and our grandchildren to understand what drives our own choices.

B00006879E|5.0|Great cd. I love Maroon Five and this cd is one of their best. It was in great condition. Thanks
B00AKFG15S|2.0|This whole series was a scam. It was billed as a trilogy and the third book was held back to create suspense. The read was ok but the ending was puerile, in that it was weak and it is patently obvious from the lack of a satisfactory ending, that it has been held open for another book/s. The price charged was high and the feeling I'm left with is that of a money making racket in the offing. Very disappointing.
B000P2A256|5.0|This was my first Maroon Five Cd and it is really really good. The case was broken during shipping but the cd is fine.
0385349831|5.0|Reminiscent of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran. Lovely, loving, and timeless.  This is truly a gift for everyone facing crisis and asking those deep questions about the meaning of life.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book as well as the other two in the series was very creative, cruel sometimes but kept you on the edge of your seat.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|But seriously, there's dragons, winter storms, political intrigues and Jaime Lannister being awesome (I know, right?). It's a pretty good read and has kept me involved and interested for weeks.<br />Would recommend to friends, for sure!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Keeps you in suspense, you never know which way thingsare goingto  go.<br />I would reccommend it to my friends if they like this sort of book.
B004SIP7F8|3.0|It would appear that I do not agree with the critics. Although the movie was good in parts, I just don't think it was that great.
B00280LYIM|5.0|My second favorite of the entire Riordan universe. Why? The labyritnth. Genius. Battle. Love. Tension. Grit. Friendship. I think this story must be allegorically parallel to my own. I resonated with all the struggle, confusion, and everything.<br /><br />Thank you, Rick Riordan, for writing such an excellent series.
B0072OFM28|5.0|You have to watch season two. There are a lot of ways to watch movies but however you choose to watch yours, watch this.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Makes for very good reading and unbelievable insight into such a backward and from the current news (2013) scary country.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like the way this program shows all sides of issues, as well as possible outcomes of the choices that are made. Professional and personal relationships are well developed and realistic
0451232577|5.0|Read book 2 of the trilogy first by accident, but it took nothing away from this historical novel which provides an historical accounting and understanding of what led to world war one.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love this CD! All of michaels albums are great. I will continue to be a fan of his. 0000 000
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Insight into what is an unbelievable country...and that the population is so overwhelmingly indoctrinated to that way of life. SAD.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This was my fault but I was expecting more civil war battle scenes. A lot of dialog, I would have liked to see some Underground Railroad action or something
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|sweet game!!!!hope you keep up the good work!!but its not that well. its a little cheep.it gave me a little credits
B004QX07G4|4.0|I got this book because I like Ellen DeGeneres. She's funny and witty. But I wanted to see if her humor on her talk show carried over to writing very well. And I must admit - I was pleasantly surprised at this book! It had me rolling laughing out loud in many parts. Her wording and sentiments were often very clever. Not only was it funny, but it was also an inspirational book for me. She gives some great advice, she doesn't use bad language, and she tells it like it is. Simple as that. On my Kindle, it was very quick and easy to read in a few hours. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a great laugh. Its just plain funny, no matter who you are :)
0310263670|5.0|Loved the message of the DVD was very inspiring, so grateful all that has been done for us on the cross.

B009NPLIFE|4.0|My wife and I watched the series straight thru. Guilty pleasure. The sixth season was the weakest of the bunch, unfortunately, but still fun.
B000001F7R|4.0|This band started off as a hard rock band & the first few records show this as compared to later albums such as Hysteria & Pyromania. On Through the Night is a really good first effort by what was in effect, a bunch of kids. The song Rock Brigade is the star but others such as Rocks Off & It Doesn't Matter really rock. They hadn't yet hooked up with Mutt Lange as producer & it does suffer a little bit in the production area with some of the songs sounds slightly like they were recorded in a tunnel. That said, I would definately recommend this for fans of Def Leppard.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|its awesome you can play with other people and plus there is a tournament mode its so awesome I love it!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I couldn't bring myself to see this one in the theaters.  I was afraid that like so many stories about African Americans during slavery, it would just be too depressing.  I was determined to see it, however, because of the top actors, the controversy and to see what Tarantino was up to now.  I LOVED IT.  Tarantino's references to so many old westerns made for some really fun (and funny) moments.  Jamie Foxx is simply magnificent.  His transformation from fearful to powerful to unstoppable was so well done and really exciting.  Tarantino is right, they did use the 'N' word much more in that period.  Having lived in the south for many years, I found none of it too much.  I thought it was refreshingly honest.  The only unbelievable aspects for me were when Foxx's character was allowed into the 'big house' in a way that he would not have been unless the slave owners were much more sympathetic than DeCaprio's character.  I hated Pulp Fiction, but for the first time I could see the way Tarantino used the extensive blood in this film to make a point.  Might have to buy this one...  it's worth real study.
1602728631|5.0|I loved it. Compelling, fun and moving at times as well.<br />What I really liked about the book (beside the plot, which might not be overly original, but is well rendered) was the charactarization of the protagonists.<br />Maybe it's because I'm getting tired of beautiful, allmighty, perfect heroes and heroines...but I loved how Martise and Silhara aren't always noble and brave; they are powerful (at least Silhara surely is) but still can fail and indeed sometimes they do, and while not being physically perfect and beautiful still manage to be realistically attractive and magnetic to each other and to the reader as well.<br />The book also has a few secondary nice characters...but the focus is mainly on the two protagonists and the narration switches every chapter (from what I've noticed) from one to the other, keeping it well balanced.<br /><br />(originally posted on GoodReads.com)
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can get it on Xbox OR PC but I like it this way it is addictive fun I like it on multiplayer .

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Love hunger games! Can't wait to read mocking Jay! You should write a fourth hunger games. Love it!!!
1616550414|5.0|Got this when it was released and haven't regretted it since. This tome has a complete background to the Zelda series. In particular it covers the art and creative development of Skyward Sword. While that section is interesting, the feature will be the entire timeline. It isn't just one page, the book summarizes every bit of story in every single Zelda game (barring two that don't figure into cannon). If there is a problem, it is that this book is filled with spoilers. Don't want the story for Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess or any Zelda game spoiled, it is best to skip this book....for now. Even if you're a casual fan of the Zelda series, this is a must-grab just for the timeline, more-so for all the other pages in this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Now my favorite book. Will read it over and over. Such a few love story that will keep your heart thumping. Lots of ups and downs but a great story. I am hopeful for a fourth book!!!!!!!!<br />I also am hoping for a movie to be made.

B000VMFDW2|4.0|Respected historian Stephen Ambrose wrote (in [[ASIN:B000FC0VOI To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian]]) that E. B. Sledge's account was the most faithful description he had ever read of fighting on the front line.  Sledge describes his training, his deployment to the WWII Pacific theater, and his personal experiences fighting the Japanese on Peleliu and Okinawa.  His descriptions are unescapably honest and detailed.<br /><br />Readers are immersed in the life of the Marine infantry.  Sledge describes the rigors of basic training and his surprise at being offered a choice about what advanced weapons training he would receive.  His choice of the mortar influenced the type of fighting he did during the rest of the war.  We learn how a combat unit functions; how ammunition and supplies move forward and how stretchers of wounded move backward.  He also tells us what it is like when the bodies of fallen comrades cannot be retrieved and lay for days or weeks on the ground.  Soldiers endure the smell, presence of maggots, and constant reminder of their own mortality.<br /><br />Sledge describes, he claims inadequately, the deep hatred between the American and Japanese soldiers.  Neither side took prisoners; soldiers on both sides fought to the end.  Bodies were mutilated to intimidate the enemy and cut open to retrieve gold fillings.  They were not always dead when this was done.  These actions intensified the hatred on both sides.  Sledge offers no apologies for the overall hatred of his enemies, but does deplore some of the excesses of his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />Some of the most intense stories are about the night battles with enemy infiltrators.  Although the Americans used passwords and dug foxholes close to one another, there was still great uncertainty about who was who once the sun went down.  Sledge describes one silent struggle down the line that left a soldier loudly crying and calling out as he took most of the rest of the night to die.  He could not be retrieved and Sledge admits to wishing the noise would stop so he could sleep.  Eventually it did.  The next day he discovered the dying soldier had been one of his best friends.  He relates a number of equally scarring personal experiences.<br /><br />I recommend this book for the greater understanding it gives of what it is like to fight in a war.  There is little about high-level strategy and much about living in the mud, with too little sleep and too little hope of surviving the night.  It may be of interest that a segment of Ken Burns' [[ASIN:B000R7NBMK The War]] contains a segment about Sledge's war experiences based on this book.not be retrieved and Sledge admits to wishing the noise would stop so he could sleep.

B00AEJM6H2|3.0|It's okay for killing time but not as good as Bejeweled. It gives you too much time to rack up points.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I truly liked this book, possibly because my mother-in-law was on one of these trains in the early 1900's.  It made me appreciate what she went through & remember the stories she told me when I first met her.  Sadly, not many people in the USA are aware of these trains.  Hopefully this book will help to enlighten people.  A. Williamson
B009R659L8|4.0|I think there were parts of it that were too monotonous and detailed, but when the story finally picked up, it was very good.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|I did love this game but they have changed the game AFTER purchase so that it can't be played unless you have internet access. I bought both Quell and Quell Reflect when they could be played off line. Why change the way the game plays? I am so disappointed because I really did like these games but now they are worthless to me. I will not buy anything from Falling Tree Games again. I'm sure there are many others who would like to change their 5 star reviews because of this - I wonder what other things (permissions) they may change?
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love Michael Buble so what can I say? This is probably one of his best albums! Very soothing but I wish he would perform around here. Haven't seen any dates in the US yet, he performs mostly in Europe it seems.

B002ZG994U|2.0|I LOVED THE FILM ITSELF, BUT . . . . . the only thing on the DVD are the two versions of the film.  There are no interviews with actors or directors or anyone; no back-up stories for the film, story, or actors; no gag reel or outtakes.  There is nothing on this DVD to justify the price.
0307352145|5.0|Introverts all over owe Susan Cain a quiet golf clap for her book. In a methodical fashion she explains introversion and its challenges in a western society that seems built around its opposite. This is a must-read if you have ever felt overwhelmed in groups, distressed at a party, or shut out of frenetic group brainstorming sessions.<br /><br />I also recommend her TED talk.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Great movie from the late '80s.  Funny and a foreseen, but good ending.  Charlie Sheen was great and Wesley Snipes as Willy Mays Hayes....\\"I hit like Mays and run like Hayes\\".<br /><br />A good sit down and enjoy it movie.
B00BU2U3HC|5.0|This compilation of songs shows the talent and diversity of Stephen Stills and what a great artist he has always been. He plays such heartfelt blues while also playing his folk, rock and acoustic tunes with such passion. His rockabilly expertise stands out, to me, as his best music. This disk should be a part if anyone who loves Steve Stills and his diverse music ability.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|fantastic movie, I really loved it, the plot and all of the unique and relatable characters. I hope to see others like it!

B0067RQYNW|4.0|It's very important tool because every time that you receive and e-mail or documents you can read it easier to use.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|While a few of the songs are really great, like Trouble, about half of them are very annoying. It's a more techie sound, which can get very grating on the ears when there are always computer generated sounds coming up. It also seems like there is less story to some of the songs? For instance, Red is very annoying as the word Red is repeated for about 80% of the song and I can hardly even listen to the rest of the song because of it. Nothing like her Speak Now CD, which is probably her best CD.
B004GYY714|3.0|They need to work a little bit more on the software, doit because you like it not only because it's a business and its going to be more successful.
B007BZM3HK|3.0|What can you say except that it's a catchy song? I would not pay a lot of money for this and think I got it for about $1. At that price I can handle it coming up on my shuffle about once a week. :)

B00CBRH4YU|4.0|but it might not be for everyone, since, well...there isn't much narrative. You just accept that you're watching a pretty film with a very faint story. I really liked it, though!

The writers who created the script of Cloud Atlas did an awesome job.  The only issue that I had watching the movie is following (don't blink or you'll miss some things) and just how long the movie is.

It was memorable & distinctive then, and it remains so today.  A damn fine compact 'n' dense bit of Sound and Fury.<br /><br />A wild ride, from the opening unmistakable Slayeresque riff to the final drone of the raining blood.  Get it.<br /><br />RIP Jeff Hanneman.  Thanks for everything, man.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Birthday theme was a Zoo party for a one year old boy. We really included many other items that played into the theme. The Lego Duplo's are just the right size and there's a little boy who enjoys them and connects with his personal experience of having visited a zoo. Service was quick and much appreciated. Had enough time to mail it with the birthday banner made to go with the zoo theme.
B005S9ELVC|3.0|A squad of policemen, handpicked by Sgt John O'Mara, under the auspices but without the official support of Police Chief Bill Parker, is turned loose to destroy the Los Angeles crime empire of underworld kingpin, Mickey Cohen. Cohen was a scourge in LA for many years, but the creation of a special gangster squad as portrayed in the film is totally fictional. Fiction or no, the plot premise is excellent; but sadly descends into mediocrity, due to some very weak writing and poor direction by Robert Fleischer, who is mostly known for his comic films and is in over his head in this genre. That's a shame, because with the powerhouse cast it could have been so much better. Sean Penn delivers a fine performance as Cohen...few can portray a crime lord with the cold villainy of Penn and he doesn't disappoint. Other notable cast members include Josh Brolin as Sgt O'Hara; Nick Nolte as the Police Chief; Brian Gosling, Robert Patrick and Giovanni Ribisi as a key members of the squad; and Emma Stone as Cohen's moll and Gosling's love interest. Their characters are mostly undeveloped; and the beautiful and talented Stone is essentially wasted. Th film has its moments, with some excellent chase scenes and shootouts; but the violence is over-the-top and the profanity is pervasive. Worth watching if you have a rainy afternoon to waste; but I wouldn't waste any quality time on this
B003O86FMW|5.0|The reader was wonderful. You could change the speed of how quickly she was reading. I was completely immersed in how she was speaking and what was being portrayed in her words. I would listen again and again.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|The movie has some really good twist and turns, plus more comedy than I would have thought.  Loved the shoot outs and good ol fashion country story
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|Most of the songs on this sound track are great and it a mix of taste.  I would buy from this singer again
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|I have read this several times and each time I find another jewel  in the information.  I would like some more info from you.
