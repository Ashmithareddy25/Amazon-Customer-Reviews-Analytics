B00005JKCF|5.0|...Most of the people going to see this are going to be people familiar w/ Spider-Man or comic book fans, like me - AND I'm sure most of them loved it<br />I personally thought this movie was excellent and it was like watching the comic book come to life.  Yes, Batman had some great sets, but I don't remember any of the comic book looking anything like that at all.. It was a little TOO grandiose, if you ask me. This movie not only stayed true to the comic book (I'd say about 90%), it had spectacular web-swing sequences that only CGI could deliver.  I was a bit skeptical at first of too much CGI, but as I watched it, I realized that it was the only way to truly portray how Spider-Man's movements were in the comic book.  Tobey Maguire was a great pick for Spider-Man and even the smaller characters like Robbie Robertson and Betty Brant were there.<br />Anybody that was a fan of the comic book will love this movie, in my opinion.  I liked this better than the X-men, even.. graphically, more pleasing and like I said, it was like seeing your favorite comic book come to life.  I can't wait for the sequel...
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink is a great band but is slowly turning into a pop punk band. Their old CD's like &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, &quot;Buddha&quot;, and &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; is what i think is their better quality songs. I have all their CD's and don't think this is their worst or best. If you like thier old stuff, then i wouldn't reccomend this to you. If you like their new songs like all the small things, then get this CD now. It's good and i like it, but still prefer their more punk look. They are fading into a pop punk band because of some of their songs on Take off Your Pants and Jacket. I still like all the CD's though. I suggest all of them.
B000063UR2|4.0|Legend has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember.  I have had the video since I was six and loved every aspect of the movie.  I have been looking forward to its release on dvd for the past year as well and then I get it yesterday.  I never thought that I would give it a 4.  The director's cut adds great scenes all the way through the movie explaining a lot of loose end but the ending...what happened!!!  The ending does not belong in the movie that I know and love and it is for that reason alone that the US version will be the dvd that I watch.  I love Goldsmith's score and the added scenes, and I respect what Scott is trying to accomplish in the director's cut ending but after seeing and believing the US ending for 16 year, it makes my heart hurt to see the director's ending.  The US ending is the one that I will be watching from now on.

0393317552|4.0|GG&amp;S is a great book.  Diamond explores causes that reach back thousands of years when explaining things that are only hundreds of years old.  and it makes sense.  <br />The old answers to why world history developed the way it did are wholly inadequate and prompt Diamond (and now me) to question more deeply.  <br />The book is great and I understand so much more than of world history than I did before reading it.  (and I finished The Wealth and Poverty of Nations just before this.) btw GG&amp;S is better, but should be read after Wealth and Poverty in my opinion.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Don't see this movie twice.  I did.  It was fabulous and fun the first time around, but difficult to watch the second.  Why?  Because there isn't a whole lot to this movie.  What's great about it is the amusement park ride quality of the first viewing.  You can overlook its superficiality the first time around and just have fun.<br />This is a movie that revels in the making Spider-Man's powers look and feel as cool as you imagined them as a child (if you were a fan of the comic book or the original animated series), and adds enough romance to widen the appeal beyond fan-boys.  Some of the special effects are not terribly \\"realistic,\\" but that only adds to the fun.<br />There's not much more to say except, \\"Enjoy!\\"  After you buckle your seatbelts, that is.
B00005UW7V|4.0|Artificial Intelligence is a film that was originally given some work by Stanley Kubrick. The idea is from a short story by a veteran science fiction writer Brian Aldiss. Kubrick never got very far with the idea but for some reason Stevan Spielberg ended up making it. He acknowledges Kubrick's contribution in the opening credits. <br />A lot of the critical discussion about the film has centred on canning Spielberg as a director and suggesting that if Kubrick had done it, it would be miles better. It is hard to see why. Kubrick as a film director has a considerable reputation but his work is generally stodgy with jokes that are laboured and un funny and any ideas that he expresses are telescoped and lack subtlety. Kubrick made a number of films that dealt with issues but they are generally unsubtle and more in the realm of propoganda. My final and unrefutable argument is \\"Eyes wide shut\\". Spielberg on the other hand delights in film making and every one of his films are constructed with a rare technical excellence.<br />Artificial Intelligence is a long film in which there are no jokes, the dialogue is sparse and never really interesting and the main characters face up to a succession of horrible events. Despite this the film is compelling and captures the viewer. <br />Most of the elements of the plot have been revealed in the release publicity and in a review in the New York Review of Books. A robot child is created with the power to love. It is used as a substitute for parents whose real child has become ill. When their child recovers, the robot child is rejected to wander about  in a cruel world. As he has been made to love his \\"mother\\" each moment of separation is a moment of agony for him. <br />The robot child hears of the Pinocchio legend and he desperately tries to seek out the Blue Fairly to be made human and to be accepted again by his \\"mother\\". <br />The film is almost unrelentingly sad. It is unusual for an American film and it may well have contributedto its failure at the Box Office.<br />Despite what some critics have said the film shows clearly the genius of Spielberg as a director. Despite sparse dialogue and limited exposition a future world is created which seems to make sense. One is drawn into the story despite not really liking anyone at all in the film.
0452282152|5.0|I've had this one on the shelf since it came out and finally came to it.  Wow!  Such a stunningly envisioned work!  The first-person narrative is so strong in point of view that you can picture Griet completely in your mind, see the choices she makes, and understand her.<br />GwaPE so vividly portrays 17th Century Delft that you begin to think in their terms and understand why the people act as they do within the social constructs of the time.  By the end of the novel, you are completely wrapped in the time.  The explanations of clothing, adornment, household objects, jobs, lifestyles are as vivid as a Vermeer painting.<br />Chevalier gets it just right!  Vermeer's amazing genius in his work is juat that: the portrayal of people as they were... and Chevalier mimics his genius beautifully.<br />I was in the Met Store this afternoon after finishing this one, and I picked up an artbook with all the Vermeers in it (all 35), and when I turned the page to Girl with a Pearl Earring, it had so much more power for me.  The whole novel blossomed for me in the eyes of the girl.<br />Truly amazing.
B00005JKED|4.0|This film is probably mainly of interest to the general film goer for Denzil Washington's Oscar winning performance. However the film is worth seeing for other reasons. The film is a an attempt to make a reasonably realistic portrayal of police corruption. It is also stylistically original is that it deals with a narrow time span of one day. A day which works out rather badly for two police officers.<br />The script is carefully constructed so that certain events which seem to be random at first, are shown at the end to fit into a more complex whole as the story unfolds. <br />The film is set in Los Angles and a number of real gang members have been used for the walk on parts and extras. The use of some non professional actors gives the film a grittier more realistic film than the endless parade of character actors normally used in such productions. <br />The film is not entertaining in the conventional sense. It is more a harrowing experience which is close to totally bleak. Despite that the film is engrossing and Denzil Washington gives  performance which is certainly powerful if not quite the best of the year.
B00005RY7X|3.0|I know, I know....Andrew WK is juvenile....SO WHAT!  Don't we all want to go back to the days of our juvenile years.  This CD brings me back to being juvenile for a moment.  The lyrical content could be \\"juiced up\\" a little bit more...but anymore complexity to the lyrics and the true message of this CD would be lost.  The message obviously is Party Hard...so just Party Hard.  You don't need to be depressed when listening to music.  Don't get me wrong...I love Staind, The Deftones, Linkin Park....but they all correlate to one another.  Andrew WK is original...he did something not a lot of people would do.  Respect him for his message, not his lyrics.  The music is strong enough to take you through the CD, so if you are into lyrics....This one just won't do it for you.  Now....on through the Tracks.<BR>1.  Its time to party-Great for the first song on the CD...sets the mood.<BR>2.  Party Hard-Made Andrew WK famous..such a party anthem.<BR>3.  Girls Own Love-Probably one of the worst songs on the album.<BR>4.  Ready to Die-I loved this song, how could somebody be so happy to die...only Andrew WK.<BR>5.  Take it Off-Great song...guys, you know what I mean..another favorite song of mine.<BR>6.  I love NYC-Pretty Monotonous of song, but catch guitar riffs and hooks....loved the music<BR>7.  She is Beautiful-Average song off the album...like the hook alot, catchy.<BR>8.  Party til you Puke-How could you sit through this song...I laugh everytime I hear it.  Music actually isn't catchy in this song...but how can you ignore A hyped up Andrew WK screamin party til you puke...<BR>9.  Fun Night-Just average song for Andrew WK<BR>10.  Got to Do It-For a second I thought this was the Corrs...then the vocals kicked it...love the positivity of this song...probably most positive on the album.<BR>11.  I get wet-Can't ignore the title of the song...catchy, but average.<BR>12.  Don't Stop living in the Red-Average song<BR>In all, this album got 3 stars, but I give it 3 and half...sure,this CD doesn't have complex lyrics.  If you want complex, go buy Tool or Deftones.  If you want to party hard, you have found your man.
B0000026CM|5.0|The Seventh One is the finest of TOTO I have heard so far. Unfortunately it produced only one top 40 hit Pamela but those who hasn't yet bought this album misses vital history of TOTO. Through this they reached the zenith of AOR. You can never reach higher than this masterpiece. Comparable to this gem maybe Survivor's When Seconds Count, Trillion's debut and second and recent Mecca debut album. It represents the art of production and essential role of Jeff Pocaro drums and Steve Lukather's magic touch of guitar. This best wraps up the first half of glorious TOTO career. Unmissable excellent tracks include Home Of The Brave, Stop Loving You, Anna, Straight From The Heart and Stay Away and the rest are as great as the aforementioned tracks. If you love any of TOTO albums this album is a neccessity.
B000000OQY|3.0|this album is good and although short a definate must for all music lovers.the fact that it is a acoustic album for the large part shouldn't deter people from buying it.<BR>the song that will of course get peoples attention will be one in a million,purely for its content.it will get criticised but in the sleeve axel states that it is just a joke and that people have always wanted a say this stuff but been too scared.its just axel being axel and people have to remember that.<BR>not as good as other gnr albums but a insight into the band at the time!
0385484518|5.0|I love reading this book from the begining to the end.  The book has many wonder life lessons from topics of love and family to death and dying. It make me appreciate life more than what it is.  It's a book for all ages, and everyone can relate themselves the story somehow.
0345448898|3.0|After reading Pullman's obituary, I became interested in reading one of his many books.  I picked the trilogy, since it had won several awards and the story looked interesting.  I am an avid reader and normally plough through books, but I really had a hard time getting engrossed in this one.  I'm not sure whether it's the writing or the character - the main character didn't do too much for me.  I felt a little bit disappointed by not feeling completely wrapped up by the story, but I think teen readers would enjoy it nonetheless.  I ended up giving my boxed set to my friend's son, who is 11, and he really enjoyed it.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a good book. I don't want to give the book away so I won't say much about it. It is about two men named George and Lennie. Lennie is mentally impared. George looks after him after Lennies aunt died. Lennie gets in trouble and causes them to move to a different town. Other things happen there.<BR>       The author of this book is John Steinbeck. He is a great author. He wrote another book about a family in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl ...
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a CD that will stick with you for a while. The rapping does get very annoying very quickly but the rest of the band does make up for it. &quot;Crawling&quot; is a song that grows on you very quickly. It has hard guitar and good vocals. This song is one reason i gave it 5 stars. &quot;In The End&quot; is a song that, again, a lot of people can connect to. When your in a bad mood put this song on and you dont feel so bad. The only complaint I have about this CD is the excess rap but over all it is defiantely worth the money. It's something that you can enjoy listening to over and over again.
B0000668IF|3.0|The best thing I like about Moby is that, in every album he created, there was always something new, for the listeners as well as for Moby himself. He tried new stuff all the time like dance, soundtracks, techno, gospel. \\"Play\\" was one of the last additions where he tried various gospel songs with little bit of touch here and there.<br />His willingness and ability to try new stuff was precisely the reason I got \\"18\\" and started listening to it.<br />Album \\"18\\" is a bit like Play but the songs \\"Sunday\\" and \\"Another Woman\\" are fron 70s with added modern gist and a sense of melancholy. \\"18\\" has a more sad and contemplative music at the core where the voice perpetually seems to be in mourning. On the other hand \\"Play\\" was very playful and joyous.<br />The first track \\"We Are All Made Up of Stars \\" has great Moby voice and lyrics are very simple with with great electronics affect. Although it differs slightly from the TV version which is slightly softer in tone. Another track where he sings himself is \\"Extreme Ways\\" and he's quite passionate and intense in that song. All the other tracks are regular soft, silent and with a loud bass.<br />All in all, if  you enjoyed \\"Play\\"  and want to hear more of it, you'll like this album. But, if  you were expecting something different, like I did, I won't recommend it.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback's new CD is a vast improvement from their previous album. While some of the songs may seem a little bit out of place or even annoying at times the CD as a whole makes up for it. &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is a song that most anyone can relate to and &quot;Too Bad&quot; captures the feelings of someone who has grown up without a parent, and to top this all off Chad Kroeger's deep and almost broken voice add a touch of someone who has experienced theese things. The lyrics are well written and when you think that they might get a little too emotional the rest of the band backs up Kroeger making for an excellent and well played album. Another great band that defiantely has the talent to be around for a long time.
B00005QZWI|1.0|I was VERY dissapointed in this soundtrack.  The film was wonderful and the score was excellent during the film...but on it's own I found it lacking the intense feelings that were evident during the movie.  Many soundtracks are able to pull this off (Star Wars, NeverEnding Story, etc) but Lords fell WAYYY short.
B000002KAT|5.0|This CD really has a strange effect. There are no stand-out songs on it, only one or two catchy phrases or lines on the whole disc, and yet the entire thing simply fills your soul and makes you feel good. Often listed as one of the greatest albums ever, Astral Weeks is an album to be taken as a whole. All of the songs are great alone, but made even greater when listened to as a whole album. The playing is not perfect, the songs often sound unpolished, and the sound quality is not really the greatest in the world. But Van's voice is phenomenal. He sounds mature and soulful, while still retaining the youthful passion that he displays so well in other early albums (like Moondance). If you are not a huge Van Morrison fan, or if you have just started listening to some of his more popular &quot;hits,&quot; I would recommend that you hold off on Astral Weeks for a bit. It's a wonderful album, but probably one that someone only familiar with some of his work might find disappointing. All in all, however, it's really a perfect album.
B00000DRA9|5.0|This Soundtrack was WONDERFUL!  They did a wonderful job!  You can really relive every momment of the film just by listening to the soundtrack!

B00005JKCF|5.0|This is the best comic book movie to date. This movie has it all!From action,To adventure,To romance,I didn't want it to end. Toby Macguire's and Kristen Dunst's best proformance yet! They couldn't have chosen a better cast or a better villian. Your in for a rollercoaster of a good time! Between Spider Man and Star Wars it's going to be close. Star Wars seems to be a great movie and this was a great movie! This moie critic gives Spider Man 5*****! for one of the best movies of the year so far.
0688170528|5.0|This novel was probably the best book I have ever read.  The book is about 2 people who grew up together and fell in love.  This book drew me in immediately and kept me interested throughout the whole book.  There are so many suprises in this novel, it will keep you guessing throughout it.  There are a lot of topics and issues that this book discusses, the book really made me think.  I tried to put myself in the young girls position, but I couldn't imagine what she was feeling.  I think this novel is so awesome because it was things that happen in everyday life.  I would love to go on forever about this book, but I don't want to give anything away.
0671027344|4.0|This is a wonderful story of a boy going through one of life's most difficult years. Charlie is a freshman in high school and is very intelligent, shy, awkward, and lonely. He makes a couple of friends, older than Charlie, who change his life forever. His family, English teacher, and friends help pull him out of his shell and uncover a tereible incident from his childhood. I felt everything with Charlie - his downs and ups, his feeling \\"infinite\\" with his friends. He is so sensitive and caring about others that he has forgotten about himself. A wounderfully touching, coming of age story that should be read by all.
6302662648|5.0|\\"Sneakers\\" is one of my favorite movies and I have seen it more times than I can count. The great thing about this movie is that it is timeless - advancements will be made in technology, but there will always be hackers, government cover-ups, and 'too many secrets.' If you're in the mood for a movie that has Action, Comedy, Crime, Drama, Mystery, Romance (yes, romance!), and Thrills, then get \\"Sneakers\\"! I recommend.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|this movie came highly recommended by reliable friends, yet i have to disagree with them...  the key problem is the script which many tout as making the movie \\"unclassifiable\\".  combining multiple and disparate genres it fails to make sense, create a suspension of disbelief, or offer original dialogue.  particularly cliched dialogue served up by drew barrymore and noah wyle made me wince more than once.  while it is commendable to push the envelope by combining genres (and it seems this is what most people are getting all worked up about) this movie doesnt mix so much as hack and chop; one moment youre convinced you are watching a social satire, the next a suspence horror, and the next an after school special, the next a poorly explained science fiction.  the transitions between these sensations are abrupt and illogical.  the viewer is left trying to put together a stylistic puzzle that cant be solved because the puzzle is a result of a lack of clarity and most likely experience, rather than inpired and thoughtful writing.
0060254920|5.0|Max is sent to his room without supper when it turns into a forest and an ocean with a private boat that carries him away for over a year to where the wild things are.  They treat him as their king because he is the wildest of them all.  The illustrations are rich and detailed with a great amount of texture.  In the middle, the animals have a party.  Several pages have no text, but only pictures of the wild things enjoying them-selves.  In time, Max longs to return to where someone loves him best, so boards his boat to return to his room.  After sailing for over a year he returns to his room and finds his supper waiting for him and it is still hot.  This is a lovely story of how one's imagination can take him any-where he wants to go.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book was an instant classic when it came out nearly 40 years ago.  The illustrations are wonderful and appeal to every child with any sense of imagination.  Furthermore, the book is written on a level that first-graders and even kindergartners can read it themselves.  This book belongs in the collection of every parent and teacher.

0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson invites us to join him &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  He takes us into the Australian outback, to the Boomerang Coast, to the famed Uluru (Ayers Rock), and never misses a chance to tickle our funny bones or fill our heads with wonderfully useless facts about Australian history, politics, geography, etc.  Along the way he meets eccentric characters and fiesty animals and awe-inspiring sights.  This book, although funny (hilarious in spots), never matches the outloud laugh factor of &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself.&quot;  Instead, Bryson fills the chapters with salient facts and anecdotes, capturing our attention in a fully satisfying way.  I finished the last page feeling that I knew quite a bit more about Down Under.  Through his unique and vivid wordage, Bryson captures the sheer immensity and wonder of this incredible place.  Not only does he make us want to go visit, he makes it seem as though we've already been.  Now that is the mark of a wonderful writer!
B0000668IF|5.0|Well, well...well.  Senor Moby has done it again.  After being blessed with the meaty \\"Play\\" album, I was eager for another feeding.  \\"18\\" more than lives up to my expectations, it surpasses them.  \\"Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)\\" is especially heart felt since Moby's birthday is on Sept. 11th--it's very eerie song to say the least.  Other tracks that standout are \\"Another Woman\\" (just love the vocal sample), \\"Jam for the Ladies\\" (it's nice to hear MC Lyte on this track), \\"Sleep Alone\\" (thank you Moby), and \\"Harbour\\" (Sinead just kills this track).  Moby is a great artist with a gift for putting human emotion into music.

B00004ZDVQ|5.0|This mix of urban and romantic music bears witness to Stevie Wonder's profound musical talents and singing ability.  \\"Superstition\\" is an excellent funky song and, of course, one of Stevie's trademarks, but I prefer \\"Living for the City,\\" an at once very gritty and musically smooth depiction of the urban scene.  \\"I Wish\\" and the reggae (sort of) \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\" are rhythmically very cool. But what stick out as pure genius in this collection are Stevie's romantic numbers.  What if I told you that \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" and its great harmonica and \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\" are not the best moments, as good as they are?  The lush and elaborate \\"Superwoman/Where Were You When I Needed You\\" and the relatively sparser \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\" are absolutely precious, and \\"Send One Your Love\\" and \\"That Girl\\" are not far behind.  But for a combined display of romance and musicianship, \\"Do I Do\\" is the one.  Rich and very pretty, and employing quite an entourage, it contains one of the most gorgeous extended instrumentals the rock genre has ever seen.  Wonder and his keyboards never cease to amaze, hearing is believing.

B00005UKE0|5.0|Prior to the release of this album in 1970, George Harrison's future as the Beatles broke up was unknown to fans.Harrison was blessed/cursed with being the second banana to the mega songwriting team of Lennon & McCartney.  To examine his songwriting craft carefully through the Beatles' career from \\"Don't Bother Me\\" up to \\"Something\\" a serious student would have little doubt that he had \\"All Things Must Pass\\" in him.  Harrison used the ... overproducer Phil Spector to helm this project (as did Lennon on 1971's Imagine album), and enlisted the support of his long-time buddy Eric Clapton.  Derek and the Dominoes, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, and others chipped in to support George on this first serious solo effort (the quirky-but-cool \\"Wonderwall\\" soundtrack and the ever-forgettable \\"Electronic Sounds\\" came in the two years prior).  ATMP contains the hit singles \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"What Is Life\\" and the radio hits \\"If Not For You\\" and \\"Wah Wah\\". I became familiar with some of the music as a child, listening to the Concert For Bangladesh.  As a teen, I saved up my allowance for a month to get this, because it was a 3 record set, had a nice box, and because George looked like a real hippie on the cover photo. In grade school, \\"If Not For You\\" made the rounds on top 40 radio in southern California, and I relished the fact that others were learning the wisdom of ATMP, 8 or 9 years later.The new reissue contains the complete album -- the hits, the 2 versions of \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", the occasionally innovative apple jam (with the G man trading licks with the Clap) -- and a few nuggets of gold.  A previously unreleased pair of tunes from those sessions, sweetened and featuring son Dhani, and a remake of the award-winning and lawsuit-losing \\"My Sweet Lord\\".  The colourised and modernised artwork is representative of Harrison's environmental conscience and biting humour.  Do what I did; buy this reissue -- even if you have the original CD release -- and wrap up your original CD as a Christmas gift to someone who needs to learn who George Harrison was. P.S.  When this was released on vinyl, cassette, and 8-track, people thought that GH had blown his wad on one shot with such a mega-project.  His subsequent albums of the Capitol/Apple label years may justify this position, yet they each contain great production, wonderful songwriting, and great singing (except \\"Dark Horse\\").  His Warner/Dark Horse label material is as good as this album.Christmas gift to someone who needs to learn who George Harrison was. P.S.

B00000IQC8|5.0|Winner of Sundance's Filmmakers Trophy in 1994, Kevin Smith's Clerks has a certain humor about it that shines through the whole film. Shot entirely in black-and-white, the film revolves around the characters Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randall (Jeff Anderson). The film, although incredibly funny, deals with some serious emotional issues such as death, relationships, odd sexual fetishes, and hockey (the most serious of all emotional disorders). Yet, it is Kevin Smith's ability to make these heavy issues funny that makes this movie work.<br />Clerks is the first of the five movies in the New Jersey series (the others being Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). If you've enjoyed any of Kevin Smith's other movies, I really recommend seeing Clerks. It lays the basis for a few of the characters in the other films: Jay and Silent Bob, the men of the Hicks family (Brian O'Halloran plays a different Hicks in each movie), Rick Derris, Julie Dwyer, Heather Jones (sister of Tricia Jones in Mallrats), Caitlin Bree, and the cousin Walter that Randall and Brodie share.<br />Clerks really is a remarkable film, especially considering that it was shot from start to finish in one day. Sure it's raw, but that's part of its charm, and that's why it's so enjoyable. While Kevin Smith has made four movies since this one, I still keep coming back to watch Clerks more than any of the others.
0783234996|1.0|How anyone could not see this movie for the forced, contrived, manipulative piece of trash that it is I'll never figure out. If I was lying in a hospital bed and some freak came into the room dressed as an angel or any of his other demented costumes and started pulling that crap, I'd be traumatized for life. It was like something out of Stephen King's \\"Misery\\". Except that unlike Annie Wilkes, Hack wasn't supposed to be scary. But he was. He really was! Talk about making a total mockery of the medical profession.<br />Other highlights:<br />- Hack, the so-called wholesome, amazing, super-dooper spectacular hero of the film ends up having a romantic love interest that looks about thirty years younger than him (of which they have absolutely no chemistry). Cradle robber.<br />- The overly done \\"Feel Sorry for Hack\\" background music that strategically comes in at all the right places.<br />- The ever immortal gem: \\"You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person I'll guarantee you'll win.\\" Yes, that's just what people need to hear when they're bed-ridden and dying of some horrible disease. Don't give them the medicine they need, just make funny faces and act insane. That'll cheer 'em up!<br />- How in general, the character gets rewarded for his overall buffoonery. *Cheer* has he torchers the immobile helpless. *Laud* as he embarasses the entire hospital by placing huge opened up women's legs on top of it (a scene truly for the whole family). *Gasp* as he uncovers the crooked medical establishment for what it really is.<br />It's almost ironic when you think about it, but for a movie that purports itself to be so caring and heartful, it actually ends up accomplishing the opposite. It does everything it possibly can to exploit the ill and make the medical profession look like some sort of demon hellspawn. Ok, granted, most members of the medical professional might not be great comedians, but we can only be so thankful that they're not all bumbling monkeys likePukems. If they were, the only thing we'd have a cure for is \\"old person lying comfortably in his/her bed and not being disturbed by some nutjob\\" syndrome.<br />The really sad part is, I usually don't mind sentimental films. \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" had Williams, and it was genuine all the way through. It had heart. The same could be said of \\"The World according to Garp\\". But, this monstrosity. This soul-depleting ogre of a film. No...no...no.....it's sucking me into the vortex! The evil...the evil!<br />On the bright side, Crotch would make an excellent horror movie villain.<br />Rating: Negative half-star

B000020617|4.0|The foo fighters are a band that has come a long way starting from it origins in the ashes of nirvana and through different line up changes. Despite the many changes, the band has always been a good rock band to listen to. Nothing left lose follows that tradition. There are songs that are more hard rock like MIA and Breakout as well as softer songs like learn to fly and live in skin.
0316776963|5.0|At first I was wary of a book containing the chapter heading \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" but I loved it-- especially that story, in which Sedaris takes a French as a Second Language class in Paris, and the students use their fractured French to try to explain Easter to a fellow student.  I did snarf while reading that chapter.  On a plane.  It was gross.<br />His best writing comes when he is describing life with those he loves-- his parents, his sister, his boyfriend.  It is that hint of, uh, domesticity which allows most of us a connection to his life, enough at least to laugh at what would be funny if we were there, too.<br />We just couldn't tell the story as well.
B000002HPT|4.0|FALLING INTO INFINITY, released in 1997, is Dream Theater's most unheralded album.  Many die-hard fans dismiss it as a failed attempt for mainstream commercial success, but it's not the band's fault.  Blame it all on the record company.  With the recent controversy of record execs stealing profits from the artists on their labels and forcing them to release repetitive [stuff], DT was actually trying to make a statement underneath all the songs on FII, showing how evil the music business can be.  Take one listen to \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\" and you'll see what I mean.<br />Every rock band that I know of has had at least one album in their catalogue that they're not proud of.  It's a shame that DT holds such contempt for INFINITY, but despite all the turmoil they went through while recording it, there's plenty of hidden gems to be found.  Well, in actuality, there's about six great songs (some of Dream Theater's best songs ever) which is not bad, and the other five songs being nothing but run-of-the-mill filler material.  Most of their albums are consistently strong, but FII suffers from those five weak songs which are: \\"You Not Me,\\" \\"Burning My Soul,\\" \\"Hell's Kitchen,\\" \\"Just Let Me Breathe,\\" and \\"Anna Lee.\\"  What's surprising is that the original lyrics for both \\"You Not Me\\" and \\"Burning My Soul\\" are much more deeper and intelligent than the more \\"radio-friendly\\" lyrics on the album.  Each of these songs had potential to be something, but they start out strong at first and can't keep the momentum going throughout the remainder of their running times.  Especially disappointing is the instrumental \\"Hell's Kitchen.\\"  It's pointless (is this from the same band who wrote \\"The Ytse Jam,\\" \\"Erotomania,\\" and \\"The Dance of Eternity\\"?  Say it ain't so!).  \\"Anna Lee\\" is just a downright corny Elton John knock-off.  What was James LaBrie thinking???<br />Well, enough about the filler.  Let's go on the six GREAT songs, which are six reasons alone to buy this album.  Here they are in order and I wish they would get more recognition...<br />\\"New Millennium\\" (track 1)-The energetic 8 minute opener which is also a bit of a surprise.  It's mostly dominated by the slick grooves of Portnoy and John Myung's awesome Chapman Stick, with Petrucci's guitar somewhat left out in the mix.  It works.  Unbelievably bouncy and laid-back.  The chorus is pretty damn catchy, too.<br />\\"Peruvian Skies\\" (track 3)-Starts out slow and brooding like a Doors song, but at around 3:15 the Metallica influence shines through.  Great lyrics by Petrucci based on a true story of a Peruvian girl named Vanessa being abused by her father.  The switch from slow to heavy complements the lyrics perfectly.<br />\\"Hollow Years\\" (track 4)-One of their best ballads.  Reminds a lot of Kansas.  Very commercial, but it proves these guys can play just about anything.  I love the Latin flamenco guitar.  It adds a nice touch.<br />\\"Lines in the Sand\\" (track 7)-Not your typical DT epic.  This 12-minute monster is the most groove-oriented and funkiest song they've ever done.  It starts out with an innovative keyboard intro from Derek Sherinian followed by the band.  Doug Pinnick from King's X sings background vocals.  Very soulful.  Lots of energy on this track.<br />\\"Take Away My Pain\\" (track 8)-Another great ballad, this one hits a little close to home since Petrucci wrote about coming to terms with the death of his father, who died in 1996.  Nice ambient guitar riff and tribal-like drumming.  Petrucci is one of the best lyricists out there.<br />\\"Trial of Tears\\" (track 11)-This is the highlight of the entire album for me.  Without a doubt one of their best epics ever, this three-part 13-minute masterpiece has it all: great lyrics, great melody, great vocals from James, and amazing guitar and keyboard solos from John and Derek.  One word: Powerful.  The Rush influence is strong in this one.<br />So there you have it.  This album isn't that bad at all.  It may not rank with the band's previous and subsequent masterpieces, like AWAKE, SCENES FROM A MEMORY, or their recent 2-CD opus SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURUBULENCE, but buy FII just to hear those six songs.  You won't regret it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was visiting with my Godson the other night and his mother mentioned that she had heard this wonderful CD and immediately thought of me as she knows I enjoy jazz.  She gave me her copy and let me just say that I absolutely loved it!!!!! This is the perfect CD for a multitude of occasions, from a rainy day to a romantic evening.  The vocals true, the melodies infectious, I am glad to have this one in my collection.
B0000028UK|5.0|GOOOOO! Go starts of this album from Pearl Jam, some of their greatest work to this date! The two first song, Go and Animal, both sound better live than on this cd. Daughter is a very good song and a highlight on the cd. There must be many interesting versions of the song. Glorified G is a song I listen to more and more. It is a strong song, even though I feel the band doesnt take the song to seriously, but they are having fun! Dissident is another highlight. The song is really catchy and it was realeased as a single, with an entire concert as a b-side! This concert is the best I have in my cd-collection. WMA was boring, but as I listened to it more, it suddenly got interesting! Blood is the weakest link on the album. But, the albums greatest moment comes on the next track! REARVIEWMIRROR!! This song is in the top 5 of their work and it sounds exellent on the cd! Check it out if you havnt heard the song! Rats follows which is a groovy song. Song number ten is called elderly woman behind the counter in a small town. Pearl jams longest song title! This is the second slow song on the album and a poipular one live! It has become a great sing a long song which just keeps growing in my heart! Leash is a cool  song, raw with energy from beginning to end! To close up the album is the much beautiful and emotional Indifference. WOW! Eddie Vedder sings the song with his heart ripped out of his body! At least it sounds like it! It proves him to be an exeptional singer that many singers today try to sound like! Pearl Jam is the greatest, long live Pearl Jam!!!
B00003CY0U|4.0|I really didn't have any desire to watch SWORDFISH, but since it was the last video left at our local video store, I picked it up. I didn't know anything about the movie except that it starred John Travolta and Halle Berry.<br /><br />I was quite surprised at how entertaining and engaging SWORDFISH was. The beginning of the movie confused me because I didn't know what was going on, but as the film progressed by going back in time, I was made to understand. Things were made clear and pieces fit together.<br />After the confusing, yet highly intriguing opening five minutes of the film, the movie slows down considerably and doesn't pick up again for about forty minutes. I don't know why that is but in action flicks, character development usually doesn't keep tempo with the rest of the film and rarely adds anything to the story.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman plays the main &#34;good guy&#34; in this tale of international terrorism and national conspiracy. Jackman's character is hired by a man called Gabriel (John Travolta) to hack into a computer system to &#34;rob&#34; the federal government of several billions of dollars and transfer the dough into a foreign account without leaving a trace. As the movie progresses, one becomes aware that Gabriel is either a psychotic international terrorist or one perversely-dedicated secret agent.<br /><br />The movie is full of action, but except for the first five minutes, most of it doesn't happen until the last thirty minutes. Also, there are all kinds of twists, turns, zigs, and zags. Like Jackman's character, the audience never really knows who to trust or who's a &#34;good&#34; guy or who's a &#34;bad&#34; guy. Pieces to the puzzle are scattered throughout, but unless you think like Sherlock Holmes, you won't see them all. A second viewing is almost a must.<br /><br />Though this is an action movie, it is also a thought provoking film. Not only does it keep you guessing about who are the &#34;bad guys&#34; it also raises some important issues concerning democracy, freedom, justice, truth, and the American way.ant issues concerning democracy, freedom, justice, truth, and the American way.
B000002BYD|5.0|All those yesterdays, Pearl Jam have come up with brilliant music, both for the ear and mind! Yield is an exellent cd, both for its content and the artwork! The album explodes into \\"Brain of J\\" I didnt feel to strong with this song when I heard it first, men when you hear it live, it certainly catchers up with you. The best version of this song would be found on the St. Luis show. \\"Faithfull\\" slows it down, buts its not all a quite song! This song is probably better in studio than live. \\"No way\\" is a song with a mysterious neat that will haunt you. The next song is probably the best song on the album, it is called \\"Given to fly\\". It is an incredible song made by Mr. Eddie and Mr. Mike. This song is also good live, where you can capture Eddies wide range of vocal. \\"Wishlist\\" is a beautiful song with a great guitar solo. \\"pilate\\" is the weakest song on the album, boring and uninspired song! \\"Do the evolution\\" is probably the rockiest song PJ ever did and sounds great. It sounds even better live! \\"MFC\\" is another good song where the band come together. this is one of the more imporatant song on the album, because of the lyrics. Pearl Jam are Back!!! Timing was everything! \\"Low light\\" was done live for the first time ever on a benefit show last year. Never heard it, but it sounds great on the album. \\"In Hiding\\" is the second best song on the album and finds Eddie soaring as in the old days. \\"Push me, Pull me\\" is talks, and \\"All those yesterdays\\" finishes the album in the ordanary slow way!<br />All in all this is one of the very best albums from pearl jam and it shows a hungrier Pearl jam in a long time. Now as Binaural are out, with 72 live doubble cds and a dvd, and the seventh album is on its way, I believe that pearl Jam is the best and have been the best group in the world for the last 11 years! Long live pearl jam!!!
B00005J6UP|5.0|I don't even remember how we came across this movie but we have been watching it for years.  It's just great family entertainment!  We recently purchased the DVD because our VHS version was showing signs of wear.  A must for every collection.
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code is an exellent cd, but check out the songs live! They sound so much better! Especially Hail Hail, sometimes, Present Tense, habit, lukin and Red Mosquito! Try Live on two legs and the bootlegs! <br />Long live Pearl jam
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is just a fun movie.  One of the few movies out today that the entire family will enjoy.  We especially like the music video and special features on the DVD.
B0000048V8|5.0|Though I was a young girl when I first saw this film, I have always remembered it. It touched me in a way no film did at such an early age and every Christmas I wait in anticipation for it to come on television so that I can experience the magic of The Snowman all over again. This film is not only wonderful for children but for adults who believe in the magic of The Snowman and Christmas. I can't wait until I have children of my very own so that I may show them this wonderful film.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Ok, i'm 15, kinda a star wars freak, i admit it. i saw Phantom Menace 4 times in the theater.So far I've seen Attack of the Clones twice, and i must say, after seeing it, i liked Episode I<BR>much better! You understand, why it's so light, and why it seemed like a \\"kids\\" movie.Things just fall into place more. And you see why they portrayed Anakin as a \\"nice\\" kid.Believe me, Episode I will probably be the ONLY film you'll like him in(that is, if you liked him at all!)as for Jar Jar, i really didn't have that big of a problem w/ him. Of course, i like the old movies better, but these are NOT the old trilogy! so people GET OVER IT! I thought Episode I was a good intro, and i think people will like it more after seeing Episode II and then III. Oh yes, and of course,the CGI is very good...
0380788624|5.0|Where to start?<br />I really love the story, the characters, the plot twist, the suspense, but.... and there is always a but.<br />...Too much that is not driving the story and the many, many tangents. I think Stephenson is an amazing author and I will definitely read his other works.<br />The story has two time lines and 4 story lines.<br />The modern story line is about some modern day business/hacker genius setting up a data/crypto haven in S.E. Asia. The characters are interesting, developed, and the story moves evenly.<br />The historical story, taking place during WWII, has 3 story lines. The first follows a US Marine through his world from S.E. Asia to Europe and then back to the Pacific theater. The second story line follows a Crypto Expert from Pearl Harbor to Europe and then the Pacific Theater. The third story line follows a Japanese soldier through some harrowing times while in the Pacific.<br />I don't want to give anything away in the plot line.<br />The most interesting thing about this novel is how all the characters, past and present, are connected and that their actions intertwine with each others.<br />The novel is filled with war, love, intrigue, spies, religion, government, hacking, and more. It is one heck of a ride and a joyous one.<br />I think that this book is on the verge of one of the greatest modern fictions, but it falls just short of the mark.<br />The one problem the book does suffer from is unneeded tangents. I am not referring to the stories that are well spaced and mixed together to keep you guessing of what is to happen, but rather the extras long winded spots that really do not propel the story.<br />I must say that I do enjoy the Tangents that the author takes and they are well written, but it really slows the book down, which is already more then a night's read at 1,000+ pages. The tangents alone could make a companion book.<br />My suggestion would have been to cut the Tangents or put them in the back of the book as an Appendix. Something called \\"Further Mind Games and Thoughts.\\" These would not impact the story line. Maybe a good editor was in order. I hope that this is taken into consideration in a 2nd Edition.<br />I am still giving it 5 stars and would definitely recommended it to anyone. I hope that this is not the Zenith of Mr. Stephenson's career, if so he still has accomplished what most authors never do and that is to write one hell of a great novel.\\"Further Mind Games and Thoughts.\\" These would not impact the story line.

0446608955|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put it down, which is somewhat obvious because I read it in one day.  This book truly makes you feel like you are the characters and it definetly makes you cry.  I also saw the movie.  It was good, but I'd recomend that you to read this wonderful book first.
0375703764|5.0|I have difficulty sleeping. I'm terrified of my closet and of my dorm's hallways. My roomate is indulging me by not forcing me to douse the lights even at three a.m. And yet, I'm still happy I read this book. It changed my life.<br />I am the first to admit that I am not the most well-read, wise, or educated reader who has reviewed this book. I am an undergraduate majoring in English who for the most part dislikes critical theory and so has little to say about the book's references to such things as Freud and the Uncanny, Derrida, Structuralism and the like. The only thing I can say about allegations of Danielewski's usage of these things to seem 'artsy' is that I think this is an unfair criticism. Danielewski, in my opinion, not only understands the big and often tedious ideas he uses, but uses them to aid his story telling while simultaneously exposing the stupidity behind them  (the faux-Paglia and Derrida interviews, for example, were hillarious because they showed really how inadequate, full of themselves and unoriginal critics and philosophers really are). <br />House of Leaves is a monster of a book which defies classification, shatters genres, and, unlike most novels on the market today, takes bold chances in its explorations of love and human relationships. What more can any reader ask for?
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Everything about the \\"Moulin Rouge\\" soundtrack rocks! Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have excellent voices. The music is beautiful and stirring, especially the haunting \\"El Tango de Roxanne\\". Many of the songs are just plain fun, like \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and \\"Because We Can\\". Nicole Kidman's performance of \\"Sparkling Diamonds\\"(a swing version of \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\" with some lines from \\"Material Girl\\") is outstanding. I was happy to see that \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" was included, as it was my favorite in the movie, aside from \\"Come What May\\". Also, I encourage dance teachers or choreographers to buy the \\"Moulin Rouge\\" soundtrack; most of the songs have a great dance beat.
B0000636UN|3.0|I never thought I'd give a Sheryl Crow CD less than 5 stars, so it's sort of shocking to write this. But I have to be honest- \\"C'Mon, C'Mon\\" is just *not* a great Sheryl Crow album. Compared to a lot of the [bad stuff] out there right now, this album is brilliant, but compared to Sheryl Crow's previous stuff, it's lacking. There are three songs on it that are worth listening to over and over (\\"Soak up the Sun\\", \\"Diamond Road\\", and \\"Weather Channel\\") but the rest os the CD is less than compelling.<br />If you are a huge fan of Sheryl's last two albums (\\"Sheryl Crow\\" and \\"Globe Sessions\\") and are hoping to find more of the same on this CD, you will be disappointed. This CD is great for summer, but not much else. The songs are lacking Sheryl's trademark witty lyrics and beautiful, complex melodies. Instead, she focuses on classic chords and less-than-thought-provoking lyrics. It reminded me a lot of what \\"Tuesday Night Music Club\\" was about- fun music with an edge. Except the edge isn't too prevalent.<br />There are people out there who will give Sheryl 5 stars no matter what she puts out. I'm not one of them. This isn't her best, and some of her fans will be disappointed. But if this is the sort of departure that will gain her new fans, I'm glad. She's an excellent artist who deserves as much recognition as she can get. I just hope that on her next album, she puts away the hotpants and Lenny Kravitz duets and gets back to what she does best- beautiful, heartbreaking, inspiring songs that make you want to dance, drive fast, and change your life all at the same time.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Pretty intriguing and well done. A real anime film. Action, and a awesome plot. This is what anime is about plot,action, a little romance and thematic qualities.
B00005ALP6|5.0|This visually stunning film is a delight that never grows old (even after 38 years) and remains the standard by which all movie musicals should be judged. Audrey Hepburn makes one of the all-time greatest entrances in movie history as she descends a staircase about to be escorted to a Grande Ball by Prof. Henry (&quot;'enry 'iggins&quot;)Higgins played by the late Rex Harrison. the songs featured here are also unforgettable, my personal faves being; &quot;Wouldn't It Be Loverly&quot; and &quot;I Could've Danced All Night&quot;. There really isn't much new I can say about this film but I would reccomend viewing it in the widescreen, letterbox edition over standard VHS as it gives you the entire picture in all it's epic glory, as it was originally intended. This great film never grows old and belongs in any comprehensive film collection.
B00000K3D4|5.0|My kid brother has watched it like religion the dance magic dance chapter. Pretty good movie. Just don't let them bully you into watching it again and again.
B0000640SA|5.0|Not only is the packaging excellent it has a number of special features just waiting for you to access.  Disc two is loaded with an array of questions which upon answering you are either allowed to move forward or sent back to the previous page.  For those who haven't seen Memento please watch this movie. You will thank me later.  I always recommend this movie as a must see.  Anyone going to buy or rent a movie needs to check out Memento.  It is pure movie enjoyment.
6305508550|5.0|This movies is by far, one the single funniest movies I've ever seen. They just don't make enough movies like this. The characters are all brilliant and after watching it over 100 times I still laugh just as hard (if not harder) with each new viewing. A must own for anyone with half a brain!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney's latest effort proves to be an overall better album, but \\"Oops\\" will probably always be my all time fave. I remember the summer of 2000 and hearing the title track \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" on the radio almost every time I turned it on. This album holds 3 top 40 US hits for Britney...\\"Oops\\" (#9 on Billboard), \\"Lucky\\" (#23), and  \\"Stronger\\" (#11). It also holds the ballad \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know\\" which was also released as a single, but never charted. Overall, good pop album.<br />But just to get th facts straight, to the person that said this is the 3rd fast-selling album in US history, that's false. It's the 4th. Backstreet Boys \\"Black and Blue\\" is the 3rd with 1.6 million.
0451204530|4.0|It is 1958. A man awakens on the floor of the men's bathroom in Washington's Union Station and realizes that he has no memory. Is he the drunken bum that it appears, or is he someone else? As he works to restore his memory, he finds that he is scientist Claude Lucas, who holds a forgotten secret affecting America's future in space. It is hidden because someone deliberately erased his memory. But learning this brings peril. CIA agents pursue him, and they intend to kill him. While the countdown proceeds for America's desperate try for its first successful launch into space, Lucas uncovers the secret. Can he act in time to keep everything from blowing up? This story is not as powerful as Follett's recent Jackdaws, but it's a mighty fine thriller that will hold your attention. If you like spies and suspense, this is for you.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it: I love Enya's music! It's so powerful, enchanting, and haunting. So when I heard Enya was doing the theme song for THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, I knew I had to get the soundtrack. And after seeing the film on the big screen and hearing \\"Maybe It Be\\" during the ending credits, I totally went out and bought the soundtrack! The classical pieces by Howard Shore are also enchanting, and fit in well with the film's dark feel. I don't really have a favorite track on this album, unless you count \\"Maybe It Be\\". I still think ATTACK OF THE CLONES's soundtrack by John Williams tops this year's and last year's list of Best Soundtracks, but THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING has some wonderful music to it, too (as far as classical music goes, Episode II's \\"Love Theme\\" can't be beat!). Still, this soundtrack is a must-have for all die-hard fans of Howard Shore, Enya, or of the brilliant film. Classic!!
0767824571|3.0|I like this classic movie and would recommend the DVD to anyone.  Though, if you're a DVD lover who enjoys the extras and behind the scenes features, I would suggest spending a little more for the Special Edition or the Criterion Collection edition.  <br />This is the basic edition and I found the picture on this DVD to be poorly mastered.  Everything is a bit fuzzy and the colors seem warm.  Of course, that can be attributed to the quality and age of the original masters, but this is definitely not the best movie-to-DVD that I've seen. <br />With that said, the movie is great with that classic Monty Python touch.  You'll find yourself watching this title over and over to see the memorable moments.
B00003CXFG|3.0|I grew up in a big house with a cavernous basement. Parts of it felt benign, but there were a couple of areas that had crawlspaces leading to unknown territory. I didnt like to get near those two large, dark holes high up in the limestone walls. My memories of that basement are why a movie like Pitch Black is scary to me. Those with no fear of the dark will be unimpressed by it. <br />A space craft travelling in some distant galaxy is hit by a meteor shower. Several people, including the captain are killed. The next in command, Frey [Radha Mitchell] manages to crash land the ship onto a planet with three suns. [Whether its possible for such a place to exist is beyond me!] The survivors include an extremely dangerous criminal named Riddick [Vin Diesel], who is being transported back to prison. At first, it seems the planet is forever in sunlight, and the main trouble is with finding and containing Riddick. When it turns out that the planet is actually about to be plunged into total darkness, the problem with Riddick pales in comparison to what is soon to come to life in the dark.<br />The movie spends too much time dealing with lots of typical earthbound problems among these marooned human beings. I would have preferred that it had spent more time exploring the wonders and horrors of the bizarre planet. At least it has the remarkable Vin Diesel in a career-making role as Riddick, the best sci-fi antihero since The Terminator. And, while the creatures owe a lot to Ridley Scotts Alien, but they still sufficiently scary. <br />Perhaps my favorite element of the film is the cinematography. It was made in the wastelands of the Australian outback, which is a very alien terrain. Add to this setting photography saturated in blues and yellows, and Pitch Black really looks like it was shot on another planet.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|I can't believe that Will Smith was actually cast in this movie. People who obviously had no sense of the James West character were out to make a quick buck and decided to cash in on the \\"Independence Day\\" kiddie crowd. So much for historical accuracy in remaking good television and film. It's not just that a black actor in this role is historically inaccurate to the extreme, Will Smith is a smart-alecky and flippant actor--totally inappropriate for this character. Even Denzel Washington would have brought some gravitas to the role. How about Harrison Ford, Kurt Russell, or Mel Gibson? (It doesn't take a rocket scientist.)  For pete's sake, let's hope this excellent television series will someday be given the proper remembrance it deserves.  (One star.)
B00005JKED|3.0|I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington in the movies he has done, but did not like this one at all. The movie was much to violent, and did not give a favorable protrayal of cops. I didn't think that he deserved the Oscar for this performance and for a movie of this nature.<BR>I would not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 18. If you have to see it, go to the theater or rent it, but don't buy it. I did and will probably not watch it again. There are alot of movies I would watch again and again, but this is certainly not one of them.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is very talented and on his way to a great career. When was the last time you bought a CD and liked every single song?  End to end, this CD has really great music with a catchy beat that will keep you tapping your toes for hours. Don't pass this one up!
B00005JKED|3.0|I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington in the movies he has done, but did not like this one at all. The movie was much to violent, and did not give a favorable protrayal of cops. I didn't think that he deserved the Oscar for this performance and for a movie of this nature.<BR>I would not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 18. If you have to see it, go to the theater or rent it, but don't buy it. I did and will probably not watch it again. There are alot of movies I would watch again and again, but this is certainly not one of them.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This album is a must have for anyone who loves music. It is simply the best album that the genious Prince has ever and I mean EVER recorded. For people who love PURPLE RAIN, this album blows it away. From the great song \\"Last December\\" to 1+1+1 is 3, this is PRINCE at his best. Buy this album and you will not regret it.
B00003CX8U|5.0|...<br />Well at least I HAVE IT, think i was very fortunate to find it.<br />What can you say, music is incredible, story, dancers one of my favorite with Fame, Footloose, Chorus line. <br />I is a must buy, warning it has some partial nude scenes. I dont worry about that myself, but be warned though scenes are very theatrical and enjoyable.<br />There are some \\"supposed\\" interviews with Roy Sheider, well there arent. These should be called some questions asked to Roy.<br />And if you want to know at least how Foss looked. Well some tiny excerpts of him can be seen when They were shooting the film.<br />It is a MUST, ... must have it in the future.
B000002H6C|5.0|I just dont understand people who dwell on this album and say that it began a downfall for Metallica.  This is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time! I kid you not.  If you heard songs like &quot;blackened&quot;, &quot;and justice for all&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, or &quot;harvester of sorrow&quot;, you would definitley agree with me.
B000003TSP|4.0|This is [P] second cd.  IT is darker( actually more black and white) than the first.   It is very good it just int the very best thing this band has done it is second best.standouts: &quot;half day closing&quot; , &quot;humming&quot; , &quot;all mine&quot;and&quot;elysium&quot; .
B00005JKED|5.0|I love this movie!  Denzel Washington is an excellent bad guy(an even better good guy).  This is one of those movies that you dont know what's gonna happen next and has an unpredictable ending.
B00005QIPH|2.0|After all the comparisons to other bands I had heard about the Strokes, I eagerly bought this dud. No fire-in-the-belly feel at all. Paint by numbers Velvet Underground wannabes.
B000002JSV|4.0|This is a very good, although underrated album.  There are many classics on here, such as &quot;rock n roll damnation&quot;, &quot;gimme a bullet&quot;, &quot;riff raff&quot;, &quot;sin city&quot;, and &quot;up to my neck in you&quot;.  As for Angus and Malcolm, this was there &quot;breakthrough&quot; album, containing some very impressive riffs.  Any real AC/DC fan should definitley own this.  Dont listen to the critics- they dont know what they're talking about.
B0000668IF|5.0|I dare say this: 18 is better than Play. It is an album that is DIFFERENT from Play. Whereas Play gets you up on your feet on more than one ocassion, 18 attempts to reach deeper into your inner soul. It's a shame that most people wiuld still stay in the shadow of Play.<br /><br />And this, no one does it better than the low-profile celebrity himself, Moby. It is exactly his refusal to think himself a celebrity that lends to his credibility as a talented musician. The opening track, We Are All Made Of Stars, shines as a track that leans towards rock and perhaps, earlier efforts from Moby. Jam For the ladies featuring MC Lyte and the soulful Angie Stone, shouts out loud as a funky hip-hop track. Most of the album unravels itself in the midst of much soulfulness. This is evident on tracks sucha s Sunday, At Least We Tried, In This Heart and Sleep Alone. Another fruitful collaboration that is such a match made in heaven is with Sinead O Connor on the haunting Harbor/<br /><br />I know many choose to live in the world of Play but step out of it, take a listen and discover the very gems unfold in front of you on 18. 18 will be truly one of the best things you'll need for a while.........this is true SOUL music with funk!
B000062X9B|5.0|listened to dolly, this cd, merles older stuff, and johnnies earlier gospel cassettes, this is real good, and most appreciated<BR>with his serious health problems, wont back down says it all and <BR>the take of one is too much, then again , relisten to &quot;will the circle&quot; with mother maybelle carter , a very talented group of <BR>musicians on this cd and hopefully johnny will be able to give us<BR>several more in the coming years
0446310786|5.0|The summer before ninth grade, my teacher required that I read Harper Lee's novel To Kill A Mockingbird, and I honestly feel that it has become my favorite novel. Lee is ingenius in delivering an effective message about the effects that intolerance and racism can have on the structure of society. She portrays this concept through Scout, a young girl who is the main character of the novel. As you read, you will witness Scout's transformation from  an inoccent and blissfully ignorant child to an experienced and knowledgeable young woman. It is both painful and beautiful to follow Scout on her journey, as she experiences a loss of innocence and realizes the ways of the world through the trial of a black man charged for a crime he did not commit. On the surface, the novel appears to be a simple story with an obvious moral, yet through careful analyzation, one can appreciate the profound message Lee delivers. Therefore, it is my strongest recommendation that you pick up a copy of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. It truly allowed me to see the world in a new light, and I think it will deeply affect you as well.
0393320928|5.0|This book does complete justive to Feynman, and his life. That a genius such as Feynman, can be so simple, practical - should be an inspiration to all of us. This is the story of a person, who loved science and life - and more importantly, did not think of science as an esoteric skill that only a few could possess, but instead tried to apply it to things that we do in everyday life. What was special in this book though, was that it has presented a rare side of any scientist. People, usually, think of scientists, and especially, physicists, as people for whom their studies carry more importance than everything else, including their loved ones. Feynman proves that, being a genius does not require him to live upto that msleading expectation. He was always true to his philosophy of not caring for what others thought, which is reflected in him starting this book with stories about his life  with his first wife, and giving it as much inportance as him being on the challenger commission.
0767825411|5.0|I kept trying to figure out the appeal this zany movie has for so many people and it finally hit me: deep down, isn't there a part of each of us and all of us that believes in ghosts, goblins and things that go bump in the night?  \\"Ghostbusters\\" is part action, part adventure, part horror, and an all-around joyride.  We meet three loony professors, Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), and Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), about to get kicked off the faculty of Columbia University, who specialize in the occult and the paranormal.  (These guys remind me of Larry, Moe and Curly in more ways than one.)  They get an urgent call from the main branch of the New York Public Library; seems there's something funny going on in the fusty archives belowstairs.  Next thing you know, ghosts of all descriptions are popping up all over the place, and Peter, Ray and Egon are in business up to their ears.  Who ya gonna call?  Their phone is ringing off the hook.  They're chasing and capturing ghosts of all descriptions (who doesn't fall in love with Slimer, that fat green hotdog-chomping blob of protoplasm?).  But when the ghosts invade a great old Central Park West co-op and take over the mind and body of a young lady named Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver is great in this role) and her geeky neighbor Louis Tully, hilariously played by Rick Moranis, things get serious.  Screwing everything up at this critical juncture is a dipped-in-starch nitwit from the Environmental Protection Agency (William Atherton) who demands that the Ghostbusters shut down and has a court order to back it up.  Hoo-boy, when the switch is pulled, look out... it's Armageddon on Central Park West, as Zuul the Gate Keeper, Vince Clortho the Keymaster, and the Stay-Puft Marshmellow Man battle the Ghostbusters for the souls of Dana and Louis.  The movie is too crazy for anyone to take seriously but it's a howler from beginning to end, and Ray Parker Jr. singing the title song (There's something straaaaaaaaaaaange in the neighborhood...) helps keep the fun moving right along.  Anyone from 5 to 95 in need of some good laughs will love this one.hing straaaaaaaaaaaange in the neighborhood...) helps keep the fun moving right along.  Anyone from 5 to 95 in need of some good laughs will love this one.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I would have given this cd maybe a half star, but of course I can't.  This is one of the worst cds I have ever heard in my entire life.  Songs like &quot;rollin&quot; nearly make me sick.  Please don't get this.
0784011214|1.0|Next to Rocky, this character of Stallone's will go down in history as the worst thing since Lee Majors. I was disappointed with the lack of logic to this movie, unlike the first which was good. After this, is the most horrific movie sequel to have ever been released since the killer tomatoes films.
068817776X|5.0|I could not put this book down! From the minute I picked it up, I was completely engrossed.  Although it is a heavy subject, it is an easy read and completelly captiviating as you follow the author on her journey. <br />I have read many books on the Holocaust and WWII but I had never heard a story like this one.  Her story shows a side of the war and the Jewish experience that is unique and sad.<br />I highly recommend this book! It is fabulous and I am passing it on to friends and family immediatly!
B00003CX5P|5.0|And from a cinematic point of view, it is also the most artistic. The painstaking work on each and every scene comes through in the DVD format. Each frame is perfectly flawless. Some have claimed the dialogue and plot recieved little if any attention from the filmmakers. The only problem I have with that statement is the fact that all the previous Star Wars films were not Shakespeare. These movies were not made famous because the actors had breath-taking lines. Episode IV was loaded down with cheesy dialogue. True, the film does lag at times, but it more than accomplishes what it was designed to do. To introduce the characters that have a direct impact on the future of the Republic and the events that will take place in the latter half of the series.<BR> Ok, enough of that. I enjoyed the film when it was released, and I thoroughly enjoy the DVD release. It is loaded with extras, and the audio commentary is actually interesting.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This movie, to me, is a true classic.  It is what The Sound of Music and Gone With the Wind and Casablanca is to the past generation of film lovers.  By technical standards, this is not at all a perfect movie.  But by my standards, it is more than perfect, the characters, the dialogue, the way you feel like you know these people and wonder why this movie has to end and not just continue being a part of your life....everything.  This is one of my all time favorite movies, and unless you only enjoy special effects type movies with no story or character development, you will love this too.
B000000OQF|5.0|I know what you're thinking...\\"what's the best?\\".  Well, the best would have to be AC/DC's Back in Black, which was released in 1980(before the era of the hair bands).  Anyway, back in the eighties when all the hair and makeup bands topped the charts, it was about time when Guns N Roses released this.  All that \\"pop\\" metal [music] was making me sick.  But, as soon as I heard \\"welcome to the jungle\\" and \\"paradise city\\", I knew I had to have this album.  Other great songs are \\"out ta get me\\", \\"nightrain\\", \\"mr. brownstone\\", and \\"sweet child o' mine\\".
B00005A3KS|4.0|A movie that delivers. Finally, after watching all of those horrible Stallone, Van Damme and Seagal movies, here's a movie that  has believable and tension-filled action scenes. Surfing has a good image and the actors are at the top of their game. Patrick Swayze is surprisingly good as the top burglar and Keanu Reeves is believable as an undercover cop.
B00005JKYS|4.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is a realistic movie about Vietnam, from the standpoint of the battlefields and not the political realm.  Like his roles in The Patriot and Braveheart, Mel Gibson plays the part of a man with integrity who puts his life on the line to do his job well.  His integrity shows through his actions of keeping his promise to be the first to step on the battlefield and the last to step off and also to bring back every American soldier, be he dead or alive.  <br />I say it doesn't delve into the political realm much because it just shows the soldiers (on both sides) as ordinary men with a job to do.  They are told to fight for their country, so they do.  If the politicians were doing their job right, then the soldiers either wouldn't be necessary or at least their suffering and dying would have been more meaningful.  Although once they came back home, the soldiers may have been subject to disrespect or even discrimination from anti-war protesters, they did what they felt it was their duty to do.  <br />The main feeling this movie gave me was of the ultimate pointlessness of war, especially this war.  I'm no expert on politics or history, but this movie made me feel that the war was wrong.  I witness the bravery, heroicism, time, money, heartbreak, injury, and death that this war consumed and think how much better the world would have been if all this energy and resources had been used on something productive.  Managing to win a war is one thing, but managing to prevent the need of a war is something on a much higher level, something mankind has been unable to do throughout history.  This movie attempts to show men \\"fighting for their country\\" but it really makes me think that it's the opposite they did.  I think much of those men and women could have provided more for the country had they stayed ALIVE.  After all, fighting a losing battle on communism in a little country half way across the world doesn't sound like something patriotic to me.  Again, I'm noexpert, and I don't mean any disrespect to Vietnam Vets, but this movie reinforces my opinion that Vietnam was a WASTE.  Men who gave their lives in it were manipulated and taken advantage of by the government.  One soldier discovered that he was going to be a father in a few months.  With this dillema, he goes to [Gibson], who replies that being a soldier helps him be a better father.  I find this contradictory.  Being dead, as this man soon would be in Vietnam, does not make one a better father.  One could make that statement about almost anything (and more truthfully), such as being a marathon runner, or a teacher, or a millionaire, makes one a better father.
B00005RIKD|5.0|What can I say about Sting's \\"All This Time\\" CD  that hasn't been said by all the other positive fans here...it is a wonderful & moving experience. Once again Sting reinvents his classic tunes & brings new life to his more recent compositions. My particular stand-outs are, \\"Hounds of Winter\\" & \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\" where Chris Botti more than fills the shoes of the great Branford Marsalis...replacing the sax with his sensual jazz trumpet.  And the interplay between Botti & trombonist Clark Gayton on \\"Brand New Day\\" brings a well needed spark to this somber affair. Plus the bluesy vocals of Katreese Barnes & Janice Pendarvis also add more adrenaline to the proceedings. <br />As a long time fan & I do mean long time fan, I first saw Sting & the Police at CBGB's in NYC the first time the guys played there...Stings music has been an important & very integral part of my life for all these years. I have always found solace in Sting's music & especially this CD in light of the circumstances in which the live CD was recorded. Sting was correct in choosing the more somber songs for the CD release over the more upbeat tracks the band were rehearsing on the A&E special & DVD release. <BR>    <BR>As usual Sting has assembled a superb group of truly gifted musicians....the core band of Dominic Miller, Manu Katche & Kipper. Along with ethereal trumpeter Chris Botti, the excellent bassist Christian McBride &  jazz stylist Jason Rebello on piano. <br />As a native New Yorker, who actually witnessed the attack & collapse of the Twin Towers from my art departments windows on that horrific day, I commend Sting & his band for going through with this unforgettable performance. It was so awful to see the attack live from my windows as the planes struck. It was surreal. Everyone in my office was crying. This devastating event in history is something that I will never forget & hopefully....neither will the rest of the world!! <br />As an Italian-American, who has visited Sting's newlyadopted country numerable times, I feel Sting's home was the perfect tranquil setting for this subdued yet ultimately very powerful performance. <br />As the musicians(Chris Botti & Janice Pendarvis in particular) urged Sting on with; \\"YES we MUST play\\" ...I felt their sentiments exactly! NOT playing would have been like giving in to the terrorism of that day! The CD will ALWAYS mean a lot to me as both a Sting fan & a person who truly believes in the healing power of music. <br />Sting IS correct; \\"Nothing comes from violence.\\" The Tuscany concert & his music in general,  just proves that intelligence & the healing power of music are two VERY strong antidotes to the horrors of hate & terrorism. <BR>And yes, I do \\"LOVE\\" Sting....not in the same way as the giddy girl who saw him so many years ago in a little dank club in NYC...but for the true humanitarian & most gifted & evolving musician he is. <BR>Thank you Sting...for ALL your art.<br />Get this CD if your are a Sting fan & if you truly believe in the universal healing power of music!!  My only complaint was that the US release omitted several excellent songs. One has to question the politics of A&M Records over that issue.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is what DVD is all about! A movie I have dreamt of seeing for five years has finally arrived. Before, Legend was good but there was something missing. Now, I have to say that it is one of my favorites. I love the fact that the beginning and ending are different from the US release, especially the ending. I love that Lily and Jack's relationship is a lot more innocent. The kiss that had been stuck in the beginning that was actually from the end is now where it should be. But, really, I don't think that I can catalogue all of the differences but I will name a few that I can think of:<BR>1) When Jack teaches Lily how to speak to the bird there are some differences in the way it is played out.<BR>2) Lily is more haughty and plays as kind of spoiled and bratty, which she was supposed to be. Also, she is referred to as the princess instead of lady.<BR>3) Lily's songs. She sings to the unicorn to get it to come to her and she sings to Jack more than once.<BR>4) Longer dance sequence.<BR>5) Darkness tries to get Lily to sit in a chair that has a life of its own instead of trying to get her to eat the food.<BR>6) The entire Meg Mucklebones scene, which some may remember seeing in the US TV version, is all there.<br />Of course, there are more and some subtle differences, but you'll just have to watch for them yourself. Jerry's score is, in my opinion, better than the TD score because it is a more classical fairytale score. No more Loved By the Sun playing over the ending, which I kind of missed at first. <br />The DVD itself is great! The documentary is very cool to watch, and doesn't suffer at all without Tom Cruise. The two 'lost scenes' are great fun, and it's amazing that they would take that much care to piece together the Faerie Dance the way they did. Ridley's commentary is fun and engaging, and I find myself wondering how Gump would have sounded with a German accent.<br />All in all, one of the best DVDs I've ever purchased!
0800177177|2.0|Francis Ford Coppola's epic adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula is a big waste of time. The movie offers lush settings and an elite cast that seems misplaced, but the never delivers the true horror the novel did. Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder are a mismatch and I hated Keanu Reeves in this film. He has the worst English accent a person can impersonate. Terrifying.
B00003CX95|5.0|The government is taking over Scotland, or trying to, namely by exercising sexual rites to women on their wedding.  Naturally, the Scots fight back and that's what the movie is all about: fighting against tyranny for freedom.  <br />Reminding me of \\"The Patriot\\" and \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" Mel Gibson plays the role of a man who leads the rebellion against tyranny.  As in The Patriot, he and his men triumph against a stronger force through perseverance, hard work, determination, and brilliant tactics.  The turning point of Braveheart, though, is that he eventually gets captured.  They demand that he renounce his treason and declare allegiance to the king.  Of course he won't.  So they torture him publicly.  They hang him for a few minutes, have his arms and legs tied up and nearly pulled apart by a horse on the end of the rope.  When he finally catches his breath to say something, instead of swearing allegiance to the king and asking forgiveness, he yells, \\"FREEEEEEDOOMMMM!!!!!\\"   Then, they chop off his head.  <br />As he said earlier, \\"Every man dies, but not every man truly lives,\\" there are some things more important than oneself and even one's life.  \\"We all have to die eventually, it's only a matter of when, where, and how,\\"  a paraphrase of another statement of his.  He gave his life to a higher cause.  <br />A possible reason he decided to dedicate his life to this cause was because they beheaded his wife since he married her secretly to avoid having her raped on their wedding.  Ironically, he later develops a close and trusting relationship to the Princess of the opposing country.  <br />The torture they gave him reminded me of the book, \\"1984.\\"  In this book, the ruling Party is much more effective with political prisoners.  They are deprived of food, water, sleep, and even basic knowledge such as what time of day it is or what became of their friends and family.  They are weakened and broken down, totally controlled by their captors.  A needle in their arm determines when they sleep.  In their cells, they are permitted no conversation or even movement.  Once they are weakened and broken down enough, they are questioned relentlessly about crimes they didn't commit.  So thorough are these brain washing sessions that they eventually believe and admit to crimes they never committed.  The Party \\"cleans\\" their minds and eventually makes them LOVE their captors, beleiving them to be their saviors from the gross crimes they committed.  The Party allows no martyrs, because the prisoners minds are wiped clean of rebellion and even memory of it.  The memory of the prisoners is wiped out as well.  This process makes it impossible to have any meaning in suffering against the the Party.  In Braveheart, the theme of the movie is that life can have great meaning despite great suffering.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|'Patton: Lust for Glory' is a wonderful movie - a real warts and all job. It shows him as a Prima Donna: vain, arrogant, bullying; but also brilliant, brave, cultured. A very strange, complex man. Full credit should go to the men responsible for making the film such an artistic success: The director Franklin J Schaffner, the scriptwriter Francis Ford Coppala, and, of course, George C. Scott who starred as Patton. George C Scott was awarded a well-deserved Oscar for his performance. He turned it down, saying that life wasn't a race. What a superb gesture? <br />If only all bio-pics were this good. I only wish it had been more influential. We rarely get bio-pics as good as this any more. Gibson's lamentable take on the William Wallace story is a good example. Even Jordan's 'Michael Collins' was a missed opportunity. Here is a list of bio-pics I would like to see made, but only if they are as good as 'Patton': Giuseppe Garibaldi, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, Salvador Allende, Oliver Cromwell, John Lilburne, Leadbelly, Robert Johnson, Charles Mingus, Ho Chi Minh, Che Guevara, & loads of others. I guess I won't hold my breath.
B00004THAY|5.0|I bought this cd expecting to like it,king and clapton are 2 of my favs.I was completly blown away probably my all time favorite cd. As expected the guitar playin is unreal and they complement each other very good.I recommend this to any fan of guitar or great music in genaral.I can go on and on about this cd but you should go buy it and hear for yourself.thanks,
B000001Y79|5.0|This is quite possibly the best album ever. I like this ska/rock/socal music a lot better than the new No Doubt sound. <br />Even if you think you probably wont like this album, you most likely will! Its a great album with lyrical genius and full of emotion from Gwen's break up with Tony Kanal. ALL of the songs on this cd are great. Ive been listening to this cd off and on since it came out (Which was quite a while ago), and I have to say that the songs on this cd never get old. <br />Their SoCal Ska is amazing, catchy, and never gets old. I live about 10 minutes away from Anaheim, California, their hometown. I live in Long Beach, California, home of the great Sublime. Gwen actually did a little work with Bradley Nowell (RIP) of Sublime. This album is a wonderful example of the great music that came out of Southern California.<br />All in all, its a great cd, and I think everyone should get it.
9626341041|4.0|With pride and Prejudice Austen has at last created a heroine that does not go to pieces at the first sight of an eligible  young man.  elizabeth Bennett's mind rules her heart not the other way around.  thus Mr. Darcy who is attracted to her must first prove his love and loyalty before Elizabeth will consider him.  this novel is one of austne's finest and I found myself captured by the story.  In those days marriage was essential to a woman's happiness and thus she strove to do all in her power to find a suitable match.  it is a task that frankly has not totally died even today despite all the social change that has taken place since this book was written.  One has to wonder what Austen would think if she was alive today.  the main message of this novel is not to rush to judgement in regards to others.  A notion wich still holds great importance.  Though at times a little too lighthearted this book nevertheless is an enjoyable read or in my case a listen.  Naxos  did a great job in making Austen's novel come alive.  the narrator read the text with the right amount of tone and intonation and the classical music breaks between scenes was a nice touch.  When it comes to audio classics noe one does it better then Naxos.  I will have to buy more of Austne's work done by them.<br />this audiobook contains 3 CD's  and is abridged; yet i do not think i have missed anything in regards to the overall story.  I found listneing to the book very pleasing and will be a fine addition to my audio library.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Hey I am 14 and this album kicks.  All the songs are great.  My favorites are Wish You Were Here, Nice to Know You, Warning, Echo, Blood on the ground.  This cd is great.  I never thought that they could come out with a cd that was better then Science but then they came out with Make Yourself.  That was my favorite cd but then somehow they came out with a better one.  This cd is a must buy.  Its only 14 bucks so give it a try.
B00005UKKF|3.0|The dancing was great. But the sound was not too good.Enjoyed the performances.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is a great CD. In my opinion, it is a lot better than Nimrod. The songs are much different from their earlier albums such as Kerplunk, Dookie, and Insomniac. All of the songs are good songs, so you dont need to skip around the cd looking for good stuff. The only bad thing that I can think of on this cd is that its a little short. It has only 13 songs, I think. Great CD to listen to anytime.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I have a bad feeling about this,&quot; says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi perfectly summorizing the collective thought of the audience.
B000063S6Z|5.0|This album should have been called Play Pt. II or Play Again. Moby has done it again. If you really loved Play, you should stop reading this already and go get 18. 18 is once again another cool fusion of gospel and funk and everything else Moby decided to bring together. It is as if Moby threw himself, Prince, Lauryn Hill, and the King himself (well, his gospel years anyway) all into a blender and out came 18. At Least We Tried is reminiscent of the Purple One. Sleep Alone and In My Heart is very much in the same form as Play's Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad? Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday) has the ghost of Elvis dripping all over it and is also reminiscent of Play. Ironically, the first single off this album, We Are All Made Of Stars, is the weakest track on this album. Luckily for all of you, that is good news to those who thought this wasn't a worthy follow-up to Play. The only flaw? There are no Southside's on this album, however, this album will make fans of Play who were expecting the same here very happy.
1590710037|4.0|I picked up a copy of The War of Art after spying it on the shelf and bought it out of admiration for the author's previous works and out of curiosity about his angle on this subject.<br />The War of Art seems akin to the likes of Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way and Natalie Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones. This is very good company to be in, in my opinion.<br />The War of Art is a quick read and, for me, held some measure of inspiration on every page. The book's central theme is a look at the artist's (writer, painter, anyone's inner creative self) constant battle with the evil of what Pressfield personifies as Resistance. I found this particular perspective on a very familiar problem (packaged and addressed in other ways in the works I mentioned above) to be one that I could identify with and while in the course of reading it I found myself making adjustments to my thinking about my work. That's what we all hope for from books, I think, and only a few deliver on that.<br />Pressfield designs an entertaining reading experience with this book, too. A great for instance is his use of a line from John Wayne in the classic western film The Searchers. I knew I'd met a kindred spirit.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is about the life in a southern town back in the early days described through the eyes of a little girl named Scout.  Scout and her brother Jem face many obstacles because they are the children of a lawyer who is defending a Negro.  During this time many people of the town could not accept that.  The children were also caught up in the mystery behind the man next door, named Boo Radley, who never would come out of his house.  Scout and Jem also experience the difficulty in understanding just how life was.  As a reader I could feel how the children were affected by the situations in the story.  Scout was the youngest and most vulnerable making her the most exciting character in the book.  <BR> In the first chapter, I could see how much I could relate to Scout.  I was quickly drawn to the description of her character and the fearless attitude she portrayed.  The games she and her brother played are the same games most children play today.  It was easy to relate to her way of understanding and going about things because she was so young.  When Scout wanted to know the who, what, when, why, and how of everything and would not give up until she understood is the way every child is when they want to know about something.   Scout's curiosity and intelligence makes the reader become more involved.<BR> This story makes the reader go through a series of emotions.  One minute we enjoy seeing the children play together, then the next minute we get a suspenseful feeling trying to understand the situation behind Boo Radley.  It was interesting to read this book and get the chance to picture the days when prejudice was a major issue even to the point of costing the life of a character.  My favorite part in the story was when Scout got into fights.  She was always protecting her family and herself from anyone who would say bad things about them.  Her father tried to show her the lady like way \\"on going about things\\" especially when people would talk about him.Because she respected her father, she tried to keep his wishes.   <BR> I recommend that this book continue to be a selection in reading assignments in school everywhere.  I encourage students to read this book because I believe it can change a person's view of prejudice.  The younger the reader is, the more they can relate to the story and picture growing up in those days.  It is educational to read on the subject of prejudice and how it was viewed in the past.
B000065V9N|5.0|So, Peter Gabriel's fifth solo album was his big hit -- his commercial breakthrough.  Added along by the very hummable \\"Sledgehammer,\\" (and its still amazing video) the album reached #2 on the album chart in the summer of 1986.  A small number of longtime fans were distressed by these developments, but the results that are this album do not warrant such gripes.<br />In addition to that big hit single, So contains many gems.  \\"Don't Give Up\\" is a lovely duet with Gabriel protege Kate Bush, \\"Mercy Street,\\" his ode to the late poet Anne Sexton remains one of the most haunting songs ever, just as \\"In Your Eyes\\" remains one of the most gorgeous love songs of all time.<br />Daniel Lanios production is strangely captivating as it manages to be smooth while still retaining that almost insinuating murky fell for which he has become known.  With nary a false move throughout the album, it remains essential listening 16 years later.<br />So may not be as shocking, daring, and riveting as his third album (melting face cover), but it proves conclusively that accessibility does not have to be a bad thing.

B00003CX8N|3.0|Thank you Columbia for finally releasing &quot;84 Charing Cross Road.&quot;  It would have been better if you had released it as the director envisioned it in wide screen.  This is one of only a handful of films that I would buy no matter what screen proportions they are issued in (UNTIL A PROPER PROPORTIONED FILM IS RELEASED - as Helen Hanff would say).  A marvelous love story via the postal services across the Atlantic.  Read other reviews for the story line.  A nice crisp, clean DVD.  Widescreen would have gotten to two more stars from me.  Come on Columbia be true to the director's intent.  At least give us the option between widescreen or full frame.
0553450530|2.0|I heard the audio book. Its pretty boring. I hear that the actual book is good. hmm. Maybe i missed something. Ill wait until the movie comes out i think.
B0000668IF|5.0|This album is excellent!  I love it...the sound that I loved about \\"Play\\" is incorporated a whole lot in this album.  There's a lot less of the upbeat stuff that songs like \\"Bodyrock\\" had in the last album, and a lot more of the synth sound of \\"Porcelain\\" (sorry if my spelling is off).  Every track has layers to it which distinguishes it as having its own unique sound.  My two favorite tracks off the album are \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\", and \\"At Least We Tried\\".  Both really grabbed my emotions.  This whole album is more emotional than the last one, which I like.  Moby, if you ever come into here and read this review, I just want to say that I really enjoy your essays and your music.  You're the greatest!

B00004W221|5.0|An excellent film.  Based on a true story, and  it doesn't seem to stray to far from the truth.  The DVD has a featurette of the real Rudy talking about his story, and still getting emotional.  Idealism does pay off after all!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I don't watch many movies, spend most of my time writing and reading, but this movie captivated and held my attention. Few movies carry you through the gamut of emotions from anger, disgust, hate as well as happiness and satisfaction as Gladiator. The story line will stay with me forever. I recommend this to anyone looking for a powerful movie, one that you will want to see more than once.<BR>Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge
B00005JL3A|5.0|in my opinion, i think this is the best zombie film ever created. the details on how the zombies are created and the t-virus is very believable. also the whole umbrella corporation and how they act like they are a happy/cheesy corporation, when in reality they are a dark/mysterious corporation is awesome as well. the acting, well, isn't oscar material, but it still is good. milla jovovich (alice) is an awesome actress, and stays true to her role through out the whole film. michelle rodriguez(rain) as usual, plays a tough chick, which is still cool. overall, i think this movie is awesome. do not pay attention to what the dumb critics have to say about the film, you be your own judge. if your into a fast, ambient film, than this is the film for you.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson brings history to life in the blockbusting movie &quot;Bravehart.&quot; Story line and drama filled plot will keep watchers on the edge of their seats.

B00005RY7X|5.0|Hey guys...I just got this CD, and all I can say is DAMN! The combination of layered guitar riffs and andrew's voice is just amazing. The influences of punk and heavy metal kinda join together to make some kick ass songs. I Get Wet is probably the best song, with its catchy hook and mad crazy power chord riffage.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is the first truly great female rock and roll cd ever . Joni's talent as a singer and songer writer are appareant on every single song on this album . Although they are all excellent , some standouts are &quot; River &quot; , &quot; A Case of You &quot; , and the gorgeous &quot; Carey &quot; . Her amazing voice makes you feel like you are actually in the room with her singing - you feel as though you have really grasped her personality. A true gem .
0684800713|1.0|I think that this book was okay.  It sounded like a modern day soap opra off of the television.  However, I do find it to be a rather delightful book.  I apreciate the title.  It's a nice title.  And the cover, talk about nice colors.
0064407667|1.0|I am a father of two children and thought I'd give this series a try. I read the book quickly and was more than disappointed; I found it to be disturbing and almost irresponsibly written.  The disclaimer that ...if you'd don't want to read about bad things happening to children you shouldn't read this book... (not an exact quote, but what I remember) was a clever catch but does not absolve the writer of exercising some responsibility.  Within this small volume are very serious themes --the loss of one's parents, the boy Klaus is struck in the face by his guardian, the youngest child is put in a potentially deadly situation and encaged, and the older girl is made a potential sexual object of her guardian.  If a writer raises these themes, I believe they must be done in a thoughtful way that gives young readers some meaningful discussion and way to work through these terrifying ideas.  There ARE many excellent children's books that do this.  I would avoid this book and want my children and friends' children to do the same. The fact that this series is doing so well gives me no comfort.
0060976624|4.0|I waited in anticipation for this novel to arrive, could it be as entertaining as 'Little Green Men'?<br />Perhaps my expectations were too high... Nope.<br />Buckley's story, revolving around the character of Nick Naylor an intelligent Spokesperson for the tobacco industry whose primary aim is to pay the mortgage and in the process challenge himself, delivers a message with regard to politics, media propaganda and corruption.<br />Another gem, I almost started smoking.
B0000640VO|5.0|[five stars isn't enough]<BR>     What can I say without telling you the plot...? \\"Amelie\\" is a fantastic film. If you are looking for a movie that will lighten your heart and make your head swim, or if you want to see a cinematagraphic feat, or if you love French culture, or live in a big city, or if you don't feel important enough, or if you feel like you're already on top of the world, or if you love romance and comedy...this is the film for you.

0783225903|5.0|I have probably seen this movie some forty-seven times or so. It is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. Don't miss it!
0385503954|5.0|This is a stunning book, which echoes in many ways one of my all-time favorite novels, L. P. Hartley's The Go Between.<br />Both works unveil the catastrophic consequences of a cross-class sexual passion, and both paint the story through the eyes of a child (in Atonement, a 13 year old girl, and in The Go-Between, a twelve year old boy).  Both works present the events through the eyes of an adult reflecting on incidents that happened decades earlier.  And both account the life-shattering impacts of simple twists of fate.<br />I'm an avid fan of Ian McEwan's work, and this novel is a huge step forward for him.  I was thoroughly drawn into the world he creates here.  The scope of this story is magnificent.  He dives deeply, profoundly, and beautifully into \\"simple\\" events of British aristocratic life, and, in contrast, paints a moving portrait of the horrors of WW II by detailing a few human survival dramas.<br />Unlike some reviewers here, I love the structure of the novel and found nothing boring in the introduction.  I understand the frustration about the conclusion; still a romantic after all these years, I would have preferred a \\"happy ending.\\"  I think that the choice McEwan made fits the character of the protagonist/antagonist, Briony, and aligns with the theme of \\"atonement.\\"<br />It is rare that a novel can envelop you, draw you in, move you, and leave you changed.  I have not stopped thinking about this story and these characters for days.  I keep thinking \\"if only...\\" and wishing that fate had been kinder to certain characters (and crueler to others).  For me, this is the impact of a great novel.<br />I strongly recommend this book.  And if you enjoy Atonement, then try reading The Go-Between, which is also a spectacular film with Julie Christie and Alan Bates.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Miyazaki [I hope I spelled that right!] is one of the greatest story tellers of all time. &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is a fantastic film. [Americans], get over the fact that it's a cartoon, and enjoy. Don't miss it!
B00004Z459|5.0|While living in a continuous loop of pop music, I finally broke free as of the year 2000...must've been a new years revolution or something...even though I don't remember making any hehe. Anyway, I slowly developed a taste for rock music, liked the sound of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' by Nirvana &amp; 'No Leaf Clover' by Metallica. As time went on and god blessed my satellite TV with Kerrang, I then heard Linkin Parks first single in the UK 'One Step Closer'. <br />Immediately I was hooked, with society springing in more rock bands with not one but two lead singers, Linkin Park was another band to have this feature with lead singers 'Chester Bennington' the angry yet talented vocalist and 'Mike Shinoda' who concentrates more on the rapping field of the band. Even though I'm not a fan of rap whatsoever, the chemistry between the band is absolutely overwhelming.<br />I then soon went into my local music store and bought this CD. Man I've had to back it up since it looks so damn old from all the scratches it's accumulated over the years. The CD has a daily visit in the CD Player as it is that damn good. 'One Step Closer'...I tasted the rock themed music and craved more, 'Crawling', mixture of soft rock soon transitions to hard rock...but not too hard of course, has a very mellow sense in it as well. Other titles like `Papercut' and `Points To Authority' slant over more to the rapping style of Mike Shinoda'. I could explain about the other songs but I won't bore you. There isn't one song in this album which is bad because they are all good. <br />My friends who have bought this album love it too so I'm not the only one. I recommend this title greatly.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK likes to party, and when he parties he parties hard. But partying hard isn't all of what AWK is all about, he's about energy pumping music that to me resembles Faith No More and Kid Rock. Unlike Kid Rock and other hybrid rappers Andrew WK is rock and roll with an upbeat positive message. AWK is a refreshing change from the too saturated modern rock world of horror and drab. Quite simply, AWK is innovative in the fact that he sticks to the basics, and does it damn well.
B00000F566|5.0|This movie has touched me so much it's great. The movie is about a a young girl who is a little daddy girl and does everything she is told until she met her love Johnny (Patrick Swayze). Baby (Jennifer Grey) learns not only how to dance and stick up for herself but she learns how to love someone and show everyone what she's got. If you want a great chick flick this si the one. Its a movie that will never be forgotton. Grey dances great in the movie and so does Swayze. Cythnia Rodes who plays Penny is a wonderful dancer as will. Its a great movie and i suggest you get it!
0783222955|5.0|I cannot describe easily how brilliant this film is. It is among my favourite books of all time and was the first movie to teach about caring for humanity despite what perr pressure may tell you. It had a profound effect on me as a young woman and as an adult it still remains one of the best movies ever made, perhaps the best adaptation from a book to a movie. Everyone should see this film.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This is one of the best movies in its category. This is the true story of Ghandi and the role he played in freeing India from the British occupation. Both picture and sound are wonderful.<br />This is a three hours movie. The pace is slow at times and fast at other times. This is not something to watch while you are reading the paper. This is a movie that requires the viewer to be in the correct frame of mind before begining to view it. Set aside sometime to watch it, and you will not be disappointed.<br />I must have watched this movie 10 times already, it is that good. The special features are excellent and there are some newsreels of Gandhi himself.<br />I throughly enjoyed the movie and the DVD and I highly recommend the movie to all people.

0782008372|4.0|\\"In the end there can be only one.\\"<br />This film spawned three sequels and a very successful television series, and a  second television series \\"Highlander: The Raven\\" has come and gone. I think there was a short lived cartoon series as well. Like most very successful movie and or television series there is a series of books to continue where the movies and television series left off, you can blame Star Trek for that trend I think. So where is the comic book and the video game?<br />Now The Plot. In 1530's Scotland Connor MacLeod played by Christopher Lambert, learns his true identity and nature of being an immortal, by dying. The only way an immortal  can truly die is to be decapitated. Connor is trained by fellow immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez played by Sean Connery, for the time of \\"The Gathering\\". The Gathering is a time when only a few immortals are left and they will be drawn to each other by a strong feeling and compelled to fight each other to the death. The last remaining immortal will win the prize, which although not thoroughly explained, is the main goal for all immortals. The bad guy is called The Kurgan (Clancy Brown), the strongest and most powerful of all immortals. The Kurgan knows that Connor is immortal and during a battle between clans kills him but is swept away by other fighters before he can cut off Connor's head. Flash-forward to the 1980's Connor, going by the alias of Russell Nash falls in love with Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) a police pathologist that reminds him of his 1500's Scottish wife Heather. Conner soon learns that The Kurgan, now Mr. Victor Kruger is around and on the hunt. You get the idea for the rest of the film.<br />This DVD is released by Republic Pictures, and has it's good qualities and it's bad. The Picture and Sound Quality is very good. The Sound is digitally THX re-mastered and is therefore excellent. The soundtrack is performed by Queen, an interesting side note is that they were originally slated to do just the main title theme but loved the film so much they were inspired to provide more songs for the soundtrack. The Picture quality  is mostly great but dark in some places and somewhat grainy during some of the flashbacks to 16th century Scotland.<br />The Extras are a mixed bag. This DVD is Widescreen, but I don't think animorphic. There is the original Theatrical trailer, which like most DVD trailers is of lesser sound & picture quality of the actual movie. The 10th Anniversary Director's cut has unseen, in the theatre, footage, mostly the Scottish Highland flashbacks which add to the understanding of the film, but for some reason were left out for the original North American theatrical release. There is an audio commentary by Director Russell Mulcahy, with Producers Peter Davis and William Panzer. Language Choices for playback and subtitles is English & Spanish. Another feature, which is both a blessing and a curse is the \\"Slide Show\\" of publicity stills, background production information, cast bios and all sorts of stuff. When this is \\"Played\\" it flies by with Blinding turbo MTV speed, with no audio background. Fortunately my Sony player has two slowmo speeds, so with the slower speed, and by pausing, I was able to view the bio information, the publicity stills, production notes etc... Another curse is the chapter selection has ONLY 9 \\"Key\\" Scenes, fortunately by using the scene list in the booklet you can enter individual scenes remotely.<BR> <BR>When I first saw the brown bordered cover, with the word  \\"Widescreen\\" all in bold caps on the left hand side, slightly larger than the Title, I knew something was done very cheesy.<br />Since I'm an occasionally watching fan of the television series, I like the movie that made the series possible. It took me two or three episodes of the series to understand some of the ways of the immortals. In some ways I like the series better than the movie. But I'm disappointed with some of the \\"Extras\\" on the DVD. Unfortunatelysome of the practices I'm disappointed with, are apparently standard Republic Pictures DVD practices. The Second DVD in the Highlander series \\"Highlander 2 - Renegade Version\\" also has a lame 9 \\"Key\\" scenes chapter search and the ultra fast \\"Slide Show\\" and don't forget the Bold \\"Widescreen\\" emblazoned on the front cover of the case.<br />So although my ratings will be on the high side I'm disappointed with the packaging and especially the lameness of the extra's. So for Highlander The 10th Anniversary Director's Cut I give a 4 for picture and a 5 for sound.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I think a lot of folks need to cool their jets with giving this album such a harsh review.<br />I'd like to offer an un-hyped review, as a dumb kid who bought this disc after seeing &quot;Last Nite&quot; for the fourteenth time on MTV2 on Easter Sunday, as that's who I am.<br />This CD is a very solid rock album, and no real hype should be applied to it.  It should be viewed in the same light as any other groups' first record - an introduction.  This introduction does well to showcase the simplistic rock stylings of The Strokes.  The drums don't overshadow the manic guitar work, and provide a simple, steady beat throughout.  If you're looking for Keith Moon, buy a Who album!  The guitar work is reminiscant of Minneapolis indie rockers Lifter Puller in the pattern-driven style of things.  Having two guitarists really fills out a sound, and having two guitarists who are able to play off each other MAKES a sound.  The bass compliments the guitars with dramatic slides, and often strangely chosen notes to counter the guitar patterns.  All in all a great mix.  Julian's vocals, while either fuzzed out through effects, or cut a bit hotter than normal, are a great centerpiece to this outfit.<br />Every track on this record is great.  It's a shame they cut &quot;NYC Cops&quot; from the US release, as it's yet another great tune.  Catch it at their live shows, or on the import version.<br />If the guitar doesn't get stuck in your head from &quot;Alone Together,&quot; surely &quot;Last Nite&quot; will.  If you're sick of &quot;Last Nite,&quot; perhaps &quot;Take it or Leave it&quot; will be the next song to infect your head.<br />Hype is not always generated by record companies - - sometimes it's actually inspired by real talent - and in this case, I'd have to say that it is.<br />To all the Strokes-haters and nay-sayers, I say &quot;Take it or Leave it.&quot; and leave it at that.  If you don't like it, don't listen to it.
0783237979|5.0|\\"Jellicle Cats come out tonight....\\"<br /> ... The basic plot as near as I can make it, is that a group or \\"Tribe\\" of \\"Jellicle\\" cats are having their annual meeting called the Jellicle Ball to see which one of their number will be chosen to take the journey to the Heaviside layer. I guess it's some sort of cat heaven. Most of the story line is a parade of the Jellicles to tell the audience, first what Jellicle cats are and secondly to introduce all the different characters and their eccentricities.<br />To the best of my knowledge the sound is 5.1 digital surround and it's widescreen annimorphic. Included is a behind the scenes \\"making of Cats\\" for this special Video release. A word of warning it is a long behind the scenes presentation so you might want to watch it separately from the actual show, unless you are a VERY BIG FAN OF CATS. The booklet that is included is 4 pages and OK but I think with a show like this, the DVD should have the Full Libretto or at least most of it like the audio CD has.<br />All in All I really enjoyed this production. The Picture was very good, although the directorial choices at times were a little lame. This would be a great choice for alternative camera angles. Often times they would have a close-up angle on something that would be nice to see \\"Full Stage\\" so to speak. As for the Sound Wow! WOW and WOWWOWWOW!!!! This DVD takes full advantage of surround sound. So in my book Cats gets the highest ratings possible, it's the Mary Lou Retton of DVD's although with our disc rating system only goes up to 5.<br />I give Cats a 5 for picture and a 5 for sound. I think it's well deserved.
0679731377|4.0|Julian Barnes uses every chapter to touch very interesting beliefs and stories. At the beginning it seems like the chapters are disconnected from one another, but thinking of it all over again, you can totally see the message that Barnes was trying to transmit.<br />Some chapters are just really funny and witty at the same time, Barnes style of writing and his way in being straight to the point makes his books more interesting and challenging to read.<br />It is worth the reading, and to make it even better read it more than once.
B000002UWL|2.0|The Pet Shop Boys tweak their sound a bit here, bringing in an orchestra for a few songs and giving the guitars more prominence. But they don't seem to have had much fun doing it. The end result is an album that's far more impressive than involving. With the exception of \\"Being Boring,\\" a beautifully understated pop song, the Boys always sound as if they're holding something back. Even \\"How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously\\" sounds timid, despite the introduction of power chords. Superior versions of \\"Being Boring\\" and \\"Jealousy\\" can be found on \\"Discography,\\" so start there.
031286504X|5.0|&quot;I Am Legend&quot; is an engrossing tale that succesfully moves the legend of the vampire into the modern world and the realms of plausibility.  The narrative is quite dry, and yet gripping.<br />Rovert Neville is excellently portrayed as a man who has survived a plague, only to see his family, friends and neighbours return from the dead as monsters.<br />Driven to survive without ever truly understanding his own motivations, he establishes a routine of hunting the dead in their inert state by day while barricading himself in his home at night.<br />Eventually, as much to maintain his sanity as out of any curiosity, he starts to research what turned these people into vampires and why he seems to be immune.<br />The plot is plausible, and the novel treatment of an established legend is exceptional.  I read this book as part of the excellent &quot;SF Masterworks&quot; series, which has introduced me to several authors I'd never previously heard of - I'll certainly be seeked out more of Richard Matheson's writing.
0790729628|2.0|The original theatrical release is far superior, no matter whether harrison ford did the narration bad on purpose or not. The narration is still one of the best things in the movie, the 1920's style detctive narration keeps the fils going and from putting you to sleep. I can do without the lame unicorn scene {which is probably a lame outtake from the cutting room floor of legend.} i dont care if harrison might be a replicant and the happy ending people complain about is more ambiguous than happy.<BR>to be honest whilst the directors cut is still a fairly good movie, it is very slow and boring. the theatrical cut is easily a 4 star movie if not higher. Hopefully one day tey will release a 2 disc set with both versions and some special features. This lame bare bones release is just lame.
B000002UVX|5.0|If you've heard the album/CD, you get the title. This is the closest thing to an excellent recorded jam session that you can find from that era. Hendrix, Miles, and Cox were THE supergroup, LATER for Cream and Little Feat! They play off of each other quite nicely on &quot;Power of Love,&quot; &quot;Message to Love,&quot; &quot;Who Knows,&quot; and of course, &quot;Machine Gun.&quot; Sad that James Marshall Hendrix died so soon after this. But it's a blessing that he was around long enough to record this rock/soul masterpiece.
B0000067X1|5.0|What can I say? Can's third album, originally released in 1971, is highly regarded as one of their finest moments, and it's not hard to see why. Two discs (or one disc if you own the CD), different from one another. The first disc consists of what you expect from Can: highly percussive, rhythm-oriented music with barely intelligible vocals from Damo Suzuki, and Afro-Cuban-influenced drumming from Jaki Liebezeit. Disc two consists of some of the most freaked out experimental music this side of Brainticket's Cottonwoodhill. It makes the likes of Tangerine Dream's Zeit or Amon Duul II's Dance of the Lemmings (aka Tanz der Lemminge) seem very tame in comparison. For the first disc, it seems like my favorite goes to \\"Oh Yeah\\", a great little psych number, great use of the Lowrey organ, with Damo Suzuki singing in reverse in the first part, and in Japanese at the end part. My favorite cut on disc two is without a doubt, \\"Aumgn\\". The word \\"Aumgn\\" (pronouced \\"Aum\\") was invented by Aleister Crowley, and it sounds a lot more creepier than the usual \\"Aum\\", as this strange cut demonstrates. The cut also features some droning that could have been easily done on didgeridoo (but no didgeridoo was used, if only Can was able to get a hold of one back in '71...). \\"Peking O\\" features lots of silly babbling and an early electronic drum sound (apparently from Schmidt's Lowrey organ), and it reminds me a whole lot of the more freaked out moments of Frank Zappa & the Mothers' Freak Out! (1966). The final cut, \\"Bring Me Coffee or Tea\\" is much more mellow and harkens back to the material on the first disc. One last thing, Can got the name Tago Mago from an island off Ibiza, in Spain. Apparently the island had some sort of connection with Aleister Crowley, and it seems the band was fascinated with the guy, which I don't doubt, given the creepy nature of \\"Aumgn\\". Anyway, whether you come from a post-modern rock background to see how your favorite groups got their influence from, or if you'rea prog rock fan that loves the more experimental side of the Krautrock sound, be sure to add Tago Mago to your collection.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I got this just after it came out and i was a little disapointed. Why?, well because of the massive hype and what they had to follow. I listened to it a few times, put the best tracks onto Minidisc and left it at that. <br /> It was only recently that i put it on and i realised how good it is. They have mixed their OK Computer sophistication with limited Kid A experimentation. The result is one of their best albums.<br /> Tracks like Trk 5, 8 and 10 have that great trademark Radiohead feel to them and are nearly as good as what i consider to easily be their best song ever - Climbing Walls on OK Computer.<br /> The only two tracks that aren't excellent are trks 3 and 9. I hope they don't lose their gloominess cause thats one of their main features.<br /> Their best albums in order<BR>=1- The Bends<BR>=1- OK Computer<BR>-2- Amnesiac<BR>-3- Kid A<BR>-4- Pablo Honey<BR>-5- My Iron Lung E.P
0385505833|1.0|Could hardly believe this piece of fluff was writting by John Irving! The only reason it gets any stars from me at all is that I have always been a big fan of his.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I hope that the people who are writing these reviews understand that the only reason this guy has gotten any hype is because the only people who listen to him are highschoolers whose taste in music doesn't go beyond brittany and NSYNC. I bought this CD at the recommendation of a friend and personally he couldn't have been more wrong. Out of all the tracks there are only 2 that are noteworthy the rest are trash-if only this CD had a erase option on it. There are moments on this CD where you can swear that he is trying to be like Dave Matthews which coincidentally he enjoys ripping on at his concerts-so much for respect. If I were you I would avoid this CD-check out some other noteworthy artists such as Norah Jones, Howie Day, and Jack Johnson. Sure they may not be as popular as Mayer but at least they have their own style and don't need to ride another persons coat tails to stardom....
B000001IPP|5.0|this cd holds many of my favorite sons on it.  radio, salvation, nihilism, there all great. one after another after another, rancid pumps out high energy songs with the unique writing style of tim armstrong.  it is evident that musically, all members of this band improved from the last album. edgy, loud, hardcore, and all you could expct from a band named rancid. i love this cd, and am not even a big fan of hardcore punk.  buy this, you have to own it.
B00004TH83|5.0|WHAT AN AMAZING VOICE! WHAT RANGE! THIS CD IS A MUST BUY. I'M SO TAKEN WITH HER VOICE THAT I EVEN PURCHASED HER CD'S IN FRENCH WHICH ARE EVEN BETTER.  SHE PERFORMS ACROBATICS WITH HER VOICE LIKE FEW OTHERS. SHE'S DEFINATELY AT PAR WITH CELINE DION.  CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEW CD.
B000001IQH|5.0|AHHHHHHH!!!! where do you start?  this cd is packed with excellent music the whole way through.  it is definately not just another trashy punk cd.  this is high quality music.  the lyrics are very good and deep, the guitar is amazing, and i dont know how matt plays those bass lines.  rancid has found its true place in the music scene.  i listen to this cd every day and it never gets old.  this is one of my very favorite cds and puts rancid on my favorite bands list.  this is way better than any other rancid cd and any punk cd out there.
B00005QDW1|5.0|The title of this review says it all! No Doubt is back and sounding better than ever. Gwen's dazzling voice is in top form, and the funky reggae beats are more plentiful than ever! 'Hey Baby' is the glorious first single, No Doubt's best song since 1995's 'Don't Speak.' 'Hella Good' follows in foot steps of 'Hey Baby' and is justly the album's second single. A personal favourite of mine is the 100% pure reggae 'Underneath it all.' Completely reggae, and oh so COOL! It is arguable that this disc is No Doubt's finest work to date. As awesome as 'Tragic Kingdom' is, 'Rock Steady' is less rock n' roll and more hip-hop. Front to back, I love this album. Totally worth every penny and not a moment of disappointment.
0789723107|5.0|If you design web sites and want to be GOOD at it, you have to read this book. I tell everyone about it. It makes sense, it's written in a funny conversational manner and brings what should be obvious ideas to the forefront. READ IT!
B00005RY7X|1.0|The Party is not mere fun and games, as Andrew WK (and any knowing existentialist) will tell you.  There's no time like the present, they say. That's what The Party represents: living in the moment, a triumphant affirmation of life. All 5 senses joyously burning bright with a heady mix of music, sex, and a diverse highway of chemicals- each offramp leading to who knows where.  Silence and calm are for cemeteries. \\"We want life!\\" shouts The Party.<br />    Parties are the genesis of freedom.  To enter The Party is to claim your life as your own.  What could be more subversive? Cops bust every party that they _know_ about.  The loudest parties happen to be the only ones they can detect.  It's no surprise that it was during the Reagan years that the Beastie Boys realized they must \\"Fight for your right to party\\".<br />     The Party is open and tolerant.  There's no one right way to do it. Kiss wanted to \\"rock and roll all night, and party every _day_\\".  Quiet Riot saw things differently and wanted to \\"party all _night_\\".  Eddie Murphy's girl insisted that she \\"party _all the time_\\".  The truth echoes from this collage of voices.<br />    Perhaps now we should heed Pink's plaintive plea to \\"get this party started\\". Enough with the cold analysis, for this is really about the heart and not the mind.  Pop the cd in, crank the volume too loud and open your windows.  An angry neighbor will arrive in  5 minutes.  Open the front door, and let the cobwebs fall from their eyes, proving the naysayers wrong. And let them understand that when we party, indeed, we will \\"party hard\\".
B000002H72|5.0|This cd rocks, makes me giddy.  Somehow, it gets better by track number 8.  franc black's voice and the screaming, eerie guitars of kim deal, et al are terribly fantastic.  david bowie once said that the Pixies were the quintessential brand of the 90s; i would have to agree, and this cd is a landmark of the 'subaculture' where the xfiles meets the velvet underground.
0553106635|5.0|In this massive novel George R.R. Martin does an even better job than the first two books of this amazing series. The plot is more riveting than the first two books and this is easily the darkest of the three. This book opens up a while after the events in \\"A Clash of Kings\\" but Martin grabs you like the pro that he is and with his fantastic prose you will be sucked into this rich and complex story.<br /> Many things have happened since the battle on the Blackwater Rush this book starts off with what has been going on. There are many plots and you are introduced to two new charcaters' points of view as well with your old favorites. As said above, this is much darker than the first two novels in this series as Martin starts to kill off many, many characters and dreadful things take place. One of the big questions to ask yourself while reading this is, \\"Who will survive?\\" <br /> Martin is my favorite author and he ha redefined the fantasy genre. He has introduced a whole different type of fantasy epic in a tale of a medieval world that is full of knights, warlocks, princes, princesses, lords, ladies, sailors, kings, queens, and many more. The world that Martin has created is so real that you feel like everything that is happening in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" really took place at some time in history. Each castle, town, city, or kingdom is crafted so well and you will feel like you are there witnessing what is happening. <br /> The detail in this novel is amazing. There is a history and story behind every person, object, or place that you are introduced to. What is different about Martin telling about something compared to another author is that Martin actually makes you have an interest in what he's describing where other authors can bore you to tears. George R.R. Martin's words paint a picture in your mind like no other author's words can. <br /> Before starting this wonderful novel you must be sure that you have read the first two books in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, titled \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords.\\" Througout every page of this novel you will be enjoying the luscious story. This is my number one favorite novel of all time. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series, titled \\"A Feast for Crows.\\" This is a novel that is not to be missed by anybody.<br />Happy Reading!
0399208534|5.0|I admit, this was and is one of my all-time favorite board books for the very young. I do recommend the hardcover version, only because it will be well-handled if your children are anything like mine were. They will be compelled to stick their fingers in the holes left by that peskily hungry caterpillar, who eats his way through everything in sight!<br />The caterpillar's face is just captivating. I love it. And he eats, and he eats and he eats...and at the very very end, he becomes a beautiful butterfly! It's just the best illustration of metamorphosis in the world. But I have to warn all scientifically oriented parents out there: My two children were singularly UNimpressed with the butterfly and the fact that the caterpillar had become this beautiful creature! They liked him just as he was! Go figure, right? For whatever reason, they--and I--adored this book.
B0000640VO|5.0|This has to be one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. If you don't like this movie then you have no soul.  Audrey Tautou is the most ideal actress for this film.  She brings the character of Amelie to life and makes the audience fall in love with her.  She is one of the most adorable actresses out there and she gives Amelie personality.  This movie is extremely comical and at the same time a great romantic story.  Even though the man she is in love with works at a porn shop.  It is a great French film and hopefully it will receive all the recognition it deserves. I can't wait until I can add this to my DVD Collection.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie not only shows an accurate portrayal of the battle that took place, but it also captures, very realisticly, what it is like to be a soldier. In peace or war, the feelings, emotions and personalities of the people involved was captured and put out there for people to really feel and see what it is to be a soldier. Even when everything was going wrong with the mission the movie portrayed the soldiers in real terms rather than the false hollywood bravado. The actors WERE soldiers in this moive. Not actors ACTING like soldiers. Something very rare in a war movie. No foolish heroics. Just simple soldiers doing thier job the way they were trained. This is a must see for anyone that thinks they want to be a soldier like John Wayne.
0375704027|5.0|im not halfway thru the book yet, but i love it very fascinating great style of writing...
B00000I8UD|3.0|His Krishna Blue and Cafe Europa a much more pop sounding than previous material, but some may find that refreshing.  You may do better to go back to his earlier works or try &quot;Approaching Silence if you want a more ambient sound.
0792151712|5.0|to the people who hate this movie your just blind and your just looking at whats being shown to you in broad day light. your not looking deeper and not at the true meaning of the movie. if its really such a bad movie then how is it practically the most successful movie of all time? breaking box office records and is still the highest grossing movie ever, winning 11 oscars which the only other film to win that many oscars in ben-hur, having the most successful soundtrack and one of the most beloved theme and song. how is a movie that bad as most of you say able to accumulate that much success? maby because the movie really is a genuine masterpiece and deserves a place right up there with the godfather, schindler's list and all those wonderouse films which Titanic has much in common with. P.S. so what if the movie is over three hours, if its gonna take three hours for the story to unfold and you don't like it then damnit cry about it then. i mean nobody was complaining about schindler's list, or the lord of the rings so why bother about titanic and pearl harbor too?
B00005QHPQ|3.0|I bought this album because I became addicted to the song Escape.  I was hoping that the other songs would be as just as fun.  However, I found that although the other songs on the album are generally high energy, the lyrics are a big drawback.  I keep finding myself flipping to the songs in spanish because my enjoyment is not spoiled by the often juvenile and generally uncreative lyrics.  Yet in the end, when I manage to put my brain on the back burner and just listen to the album to enjoy Enrique's singing, I have to admit I liking it.
6304806442|5.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart or those looking for a laid back movie.  This story of a group of friends, also heroin addicts, is so truthful and convincing that it will make your stomach twist.  I know it made me look at things in an entirely new way.<BR>  Ewan McGregor as Mark Renton, the main character who wants to get off heroin but finds the road difficult with many falls back to addictive drug.  The entire story is through his eyes and how he views his so called mates and the situations they find themselves in.  McGregor slips into the role so thoroughly that you forget he's an actor and begin to truly think of only the character Mark Renton.  You, along with Renton, feel the highs and lows of heroin.  You feel his depression as he fights the addiction.  <BR>  The other characters, Spud, Sick Boy, Diane and Begbie are created so well that they all interact amazingly.  The script is wonderfully adapted from Irvine welsh's novel.  Many think the story is about how good heroin is, but the story is actually about true life. It doesn't glamorize anything.  You see the brillance of the drug at the characters first hit, but see the fatal and lows of it also as the characters fight to get off it or fall to new points of poverty financing their addiction. <BR>   It's all around a brilliantly told story that is truthful and pulls not punches.  You see every detail, not just the bad and not just the good.  It's not everyone's type of movie, but if you're looking for a very well done piece of work, this is the movie.
B00005R2M3|4.0|My first thought is &quot;Wow&quot;.  Along comes another skinny blond singer and I am thinking, so what?  Turns out this is a great album.  Shakira is so very talented.    &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is so far up in my head that I find myself singing it constantly. I think this is just #1 in a long line of English albums by Shakira that will go very far.
0790729628|5.0|This dark, brooding thriller, ranks as one of my all-time favourite science fiction movies. Stirling acting performances from Harrison Ford and Ratgur Hauer, coupled with the dark, murky atmosphere created by Director Ridley Scott combine to make this an engrossing thriller that draws you into Ridley Scotts hazy labrynth of futuristic Los Angeles.  Movies such as the Fifth Element have drawn inspiration from Blade Runner, but none quite manage to pull it all together like Ridley Scott has done with Blade Runner.  Expect a very atmospheric movie, excellent acting, appropriate background music score and an intertesting twist that keeps you interested right to the end.  Dated in some respects but essential viewing. Highly Recommended.
0201633612|4.0|If you consider yourself an OO designer/programmer, this is the book to have. Of course, because this original is a bit older now, you need other sources to get the full picture of patterns that are now known.
0345448898|1.0|I'd like to identify myself as a liberal Christian.  I scoffed at the Religious Right demanding that Harry Potter be banned because it advocated witchcraft.  I walked proudly through the picketers to see Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ, and I found it to be a profound spiritual experience.  But I can not stomach Pullman's work.<br />I was given this boxed set as a gift because I enjoy fantasy novels.  I'm glad I didn't spend my money to support these works.<br />The first novel seems only to attack the Catholic church.  While this is not exactly my cup of tea (I have respect for all denominations), it's not that unusual.  Certainly some actions of the Catholic church (from the Inquisition to the recent sex abuse scandal) are reprehensible, although the Catholic beliefs themselves are filled with beauty and spiritual strength.<br />However, by the end of the second book, when it became clear that these books were hate-filled attacks on God, I became repelled and sickened.  In case you haven't heard these are not attacks on a god, but God.  The Judeo-Christian God.  The God that 90% of Americans in polls say they believe in.<br />In my opinion, it's no use bringing up Milton or Blake.  Both loved God.  Milton was a Puritan, for heaven's sake, and Blake, although a Romantic rebel through and through, loved God and hated the abuses of organized religion.  But Pullman hates God!  And he has written a book for children that presents this hatred in an exciting, well-written story.  This is seductive, sickening, and, yes, evil.<br />I admit that I stopped reading after barely beginning the third book, since it was clear to me where it was going.  I suspect that he wraps himself in the tired mantle of \\"I'm truly spiritual, not religious.\\"  But make no mistake, any set of books that attacks the basic belief in a Judeo-Christian God is not spiritual in any sense.  Hatred and bigotry are an attack on all spiritual beliefs.  Be warned.
0446677450|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It changed the way I look at money forever and for the better. I have given this book to everyone I know. I've even gone on the read his other books all of which are equally good. In all honestly, the beginning is a bit slow, and some parts of it seem a bit repetitive, but that is only done to really make these ideas stick. This is a great book for beginners too, but when I give it as a gift I do balance it with Suze Orman. Rich Dad Poor Dad, has convinced me to put money a side each month to invest, to get a financial advisor and how to talk to him, it has opened my eyes to all the possibilities in real Estate, how to handle taxes and convinced me to never stop learning about finances and investing. After you read this book you have to read his next one too, Cash Flow Quadrant! This book has really changed my life, and has motivated me to the point that I can hardly sit still!!
0440219078|4.0|Lois Lowry tells an amazing story about a young boy called Jonas who lives in a world where everything is under control. Everything is planned out for everyone and if someone breaks a rule, he \\"gets released\\" from the community. On the day of the big \\"Ceremony of Twelve\\", Jonas is selected to be the next 'Receiver of Memories' - the person who gathers the memories of the past. This job includes pain, sorrow, and happiness. Jonas realizes that the world he lives in is not as great as everybody thought.<br />'The Giver' gives an important message to the reader: Living in a world where there is independence and choices is better than living in a world where everything seems to be perfect.<br />The exceptional feature of this story is that everything is written as easy as possible and sometimes you get the impression that it is just fun but this book is one of those with the highest level of hidden social critism.
B0000640SA|5.0|Well I just got arguably one of the best DVD's ever made. This DVD is right up there with the Special Editions that we're served up for Fight Club & Seven (except there aren't 4 commentaries), but here 1 commentary from the MAN - Christopher Nolan, is all you need. As soon as you put in the movie the fun begins. I won't go into detail, but it gets you REALLY geared up and in the perfect mood to watch the movie. <br />So I pop in the first disc and I get the movie playing, which I haven't watched in about 4 or 5 months. When I first saw this movie - I couldn't stop watching it. Now after having not seen it for awhile, it was all slowly starting to come back to me as I watched and tried to put this puzzle of a movie together again but came up a little short. I felt exactly like Leonard Shelby, I forgot little details and therefore couldn't remember how the story was going to finish(start?) - but I had a vague idea - I just needed my memory to be refreshed by seeing it again.<br />All I did was watch the movie so far (worth the price by itself) but can't wait to watch the track with Nolan's commentary which I'm going to make the last thing on this DVD that I watch, because I want to psycho- analyze and have more fun with this movie before Nolan tells me everything and puts all my theories to rest. So you get the movie, a commentary track from Nolan - and the rest of the Special Features you will have to find yourself. But rest assured, this DVD will keep you very, very busy.
B000001ES9|2.0|Rush has had this guitar rock intensity that has stuck with them throughout their whole life as a band.  It shined through their prog-rock experiments in the 70s, endured the BS of the 80s and came out on top in the 90s once again.  This album, being their first, is a good explanation for their current sound, and is the fundamental of all the albums to come, save that the drummer in this album is not Neil Peart.  It's very Zeppelin-ish guitar rock in a less bluesy, more straight-forward fashion.  It's something you'd hear on a guitar rock station next to AC/DC and Lynyrd Skynyrd.<BR>So, what's wrong with the album?  Pretty much everything... the production is second-rate, the music is less than entertaining, the cover itself just shows the person that minimal effort was put into it.  However, this is Rush's infancy, and I'm sure the budget behind this album was low.  All this can be forgiven when put into perspective with Rush's other work.  The only tracks I can really listen to are Finding My Way and Working Man, and you can get those on Chronicles along with a bunch of other good Rush stuff.<BR>I would recommend this for people who want to collect everything Rush, people who are 70's brainless guitar-rock activists, or someone who is making a documentary about Rush.  It's definitely not their shining moment, but it's the start of one of the best rock bands in history.
B000002WCJ|4.0|4 stars is only because I rarely give 5.  For power metal alone, this is easily a 5-star album.  If you don't like high vocals, fantasy imagery, virtuoso guitar and a little bit of \\"cheese,\\" then beware.  But, then again, you probably don't like power metal at all, do you?<br />The title song alone is simply amazing.  Highly recommended.
B000001ESF|3.0|Rush was one of the few bands of its time to popularize the concept song and concept album.  This particular one is by a longshot their most successful attempt at concept music.  Taking place in the year 2112, it talks about how a man brings back the elder race of humanity by learning how to play a guitar (this is grossly paraphrased, but I don't have the patience for a whole synopsis).  The music involved is some of the most memorable music Rush has made, even that low-tech sci-fi sound in the beginning is instantly recognized as Rush.  2112 is a classic, for Rush and the entire rock world.<BR>So why only 3 stars?  The rest of the album.  The b-side songs on this album are poorly made, anticlimax, and so completely unmemorable, the listener probably still thinks the album's only 20 minutes long.  However, the epic title track makes this whole album worth its purchase.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Let me just say God Bless the Coen brothers. These two guys from Minnesota have given us some of the most original and funny movies of the last 20 years. After releasing a modern day classic with &quot;THE BIG LEBOWSKI&quot;, the Coens then gave us the depression era comedy &quot;O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?&quot;. With the Coens you never know what to expect, but you know it will always be a well made movie that gets better with repeat viewings. This movie ranks in the Coens top 3 behind &quot;FARGO&quot;, and just ahead of &quot;RAISING ARIZONA&quot;. The movie has top notch performances from John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Charles Durning, and if you ask me a very Oscar worthy turn by George Clooney. One of the Coen brothers great talents is too paint a great picture of when and where the story is taking place, and this movie falls right in line. Set in the heart of the Mississippi during the depression, Clooney and his partners in crime travel thru absolutely beautiful delta land in search of their goal. Just watching it makes me want to sip on an ice cold lemonade, no kiddin'. The film transfer and colors are excellent on this release. Basicly, you've got a great movie with great performances, but this all actually takes a back seat to the best part of the movie, the music. Leave it up to the Coens to bring roots music back to the to the attention of music fans everywhere. The music is great, fits right in with the story, and the sound on this disc is perfect. Definetly no complaints with the movie, a must see. The disc includes a cool but not long enough featurette, post production process, the Soggy Bottom Boys music video, theatrical trailer, and a very interesting script to storyboard feature. My only wishes were maybe some deleted scenes, and the ever elusive Coen brothers commentary track. Neither of which appear on this disc, but hey, I can't complain with the overall quality of this movie and disc. This will make a great addition to any collection. Enjoy movie and DVD fans.
B000063UR2|5.0|When \\"Legend\\" was released in the U.S. in a severely butchered 89-minute version, already having been stripped of Jerry Goldsmith's original score and about a fourth of the footage, no one accepted it.  It was just one of those 'here today, gone tomorrow' films.  Ridley Scott's true vision was lost.  With the new DVD, this vision has been found.  Although a much different film than the previous versions, it is exactly what Ridley should have put out in 1985 but did not.  And even though the production is a bit cheezy (compared to \\"Lord Of The Rings\\"), it is nonetheless spectacular...right down to Jerry Goldsmith's restored orchestral score.  Forget the U.S. Tangerine Dream-scored version...the director's cut is the only version for me, and I hope you too.  By all means, get this DVD, and \\"Sing The Wee\\" with your own \\"True Love's Eyes\\"!  Wingo-wango!
B000003JBM|4.0|I like this album quite a bit, and I am equally impressed by the jazz and hip-hop elements in it, but people! Don't forget that hip-hop/jazz fusion is not a new idea in music. Us3 might have been the first to try it on a mainstream release, but probably not. I do like the idea a lot, but because it is about 10 years old, more thought needs to go into it now. It takes more than JUST mixing two styles; in my mind, artists need to break each type of music down into its very core elements (rather than just samples, or &quot;jazzy-sounding&quot; licks, or what have you), and building new music from the ground up. Again, I am impressed by this album - but don't forget to keep moving the bar higher!
B000066AXE|2.0|i dont know about everybody else, but i didnt see what the fuss was about with this film. maybe i was just biased with Lord of the Rings, which was by far the better film last year, but i didnt like this film that much. i think one true mark of a good film is if there are memorable scenes. i can only think of two scenes in this movie that i consider memorable: the bar scene where he figures out his equation, and near the end when the guy from the Nobel Peace prize shows up. he greets the professor who immediately stops one of his students to ask him if he can see someone where this representative was. that was a memorable scene. but it just seemed to be a slow movie to me that i didnt enjoy as much. then again, i really didnt want this movie to win best picture. Lord of the Rings deserved that honor.
B000060P79|2.0|I don't understand why this cd got such great reviews.  I'm not trying to bash Simple Plan, I don't even have the cd, but it seems very unoriginal and more pop than punk.  They sound way too much like Blink-182 only even more immature.  How old are the band members anyway?
B0000640VO|5.0|I saw this film in Romania with romanian subtitles. while i'm fluent in romanian, i didnt catch all the laughter others around me caught. still, the jokes i did manage to catch--like the amount of orgasms in the city at that moment, and many others--were just wonderful. <br />this is a marvelous film and one everyone should watch. and i wait with excitement for the DVD this summer.
B0000640SB|5.0|in 1997, my fourth of july weekend [stunk]! but there was one highlight--not the fireworks, which are becoming boring to me. the one highlight of that fourth of july weekend was seeing Men In Black. i laughed nearly through the whole film. that is the sign of a great film. and i eagerly wait for MIB2 this summer.
B00000K19E|5.0|I realized that i did not write a review for this classic. i noticed that 2300 other people wrote reviews--one reason why i decided not to for so long. but i figured, what the hey, i'll write a review. you all know how good this movie is, so i wont need to tell you about it. all i want to say is that AFI better be putting this movie on its classics list. if they dont, then dont bother believing any list AFI creates.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|that is my big critique of Ali. it has some wonderful acting in it and the boxing scenes are totally cool. i hadnt really paid attention to Muhammed Ali's life before seeing this film, so i always questioned why everybody thought he was the best. once seeing this film, i could see why. but still, i had the feeling like the movie just simply picked up from Ali's life in 1964 and ending in 1976--or whenever that rumble in the jungle was--without really saying much of anything plot-wise.
B00000J7J4|2.0|you know, i bought this disk on the strength of Smooth, the AWESOME cha-cha song! but as i listened to the rest, i just wasnt attracted to all the other songs. so i sold the CD. oh well.
0790734249|5.0|This film is truly one of the all time greats. for anyone who loves music, this is a beautiful film. there is something poetic in the screenplay. the acting is absolutely superb. i can feel the rapture that salieri feels during scenes whene he describes Mozart's music to the priest. there is a perfect flow in this film. like a river, it floats calmly during the peaceful moments, but rages with thunder during the emotional climaxes. all film students should study this film and learn how to make a true masterpiece.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Baz Luhrman is one of the great new talents in filmwork. As is evident with three of his big films, Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge, and this one, Strictly Ballroom, he has a true talent for making great films. I love to ballroom dance, and i could relate with much of what was in the film. also, the documentary included in the DVD, \\"slow samba to foxtrot\\" is excellent. it's great to see ballroom dancing appreciated by many people around the world. Also, for those who like ballroom dancing films, check out Shall We Dance?, a great ballroom dance film out of Japan. that one is also a classic!
B00003CXI1|3.0|i've been debating over the last few months whether or not to get this DVD. after all, i didnt enjoy the movie that much. i want to like the film i really do. and there are parts that are quite enjoyable, like Hermoine. she was very good, as was Ron. but i cant like the film because it really felt like it was just a copy of the book. it didnt have life of its own. maybe chris columbus has learned and will do chamber of secrets differently. i hope he does, because unfortunately, i, like everybody else, now will dutifully go in november and see chamber of secrets. how can i not see it?
0783225857|5.0|what a wonderful film. if only i could have had a father like that when i was a kid....boy what could have been of me? oh well, that's life. a wonderful film though.
B000063S6Z|4.0|Moby's 18 starts off sounding like Play Volume II, but around &quot;In My Heart&quot; you begin to notice it has it's own personality.  In several ways the sounds of Everything Is Wrong come through - after a few listens I'd almost call this a volume II to Everything Is Wrong, alibet more mature, the sound that Moby would come up with after spending a few years playing with the vocal samples and styles of music used in Play.  I think this is something that will grown on me after a while, like Play did.  On the other hand, I can't see every track getting licensed out to TV and movies as happened with Play.  Time will tell.<br />Overall - good disc.  Glad I bought it, I'd recommend it to anybody who likes Moby's stuff.  The one recommendation I'd make is don't listen to a track (mp3, whatever) just once and base your purchase decision off that...I'd say best track is In My Heart...give that a try and see what you think!
B0000667RO|3.0|This was released 2 1/2 years ago in the UK with pretty much the same track listing. If it were to be a companion 'hits' package to SO FAR SO GOOD, it should have included songs not on that and then the newer hits. Missing from it is his last top-ten hit I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE with Barbra Streisand, THOUGHT I'D DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, ON A DAY LIKE TODAY, THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER TONIGHT, DON&quot;T GIVE UP and others. The 'new' song BEST OF ME was also released a couple years ago and really isn't that great. Too bad, this could have been better. (the artwork is really bad too.)
B00003CX5P|4.0|Well, personally liked it.  And I walked into that theater to see it only expecting it to be just as good, or at least fitting to the entire story of Star Wars.  (after all, all of them were written together)  I walked out of that theater totally satisfied.  Alone, it probably would not stand, but it's not supposed to be taken alone.  And as for Jar-jar (many point to him being a downturn to the film) I found him easy to ignore, I expect that most of his purpose was for comic relief, (in the absense of R2D2 and C3PO as a duo, which they wound up together for only a few brief scenes). Yet, Jar-jar had a few pivital parts in the movie... think, you can figure them out.  Just the fact that many people I have talked to expect some enormously huge movie that blows away Episodes 4, 5, and 6 and walk away dissappointed annoys me.  I think that Episode 1 is a worthy beginning to the ENTIRE story of Star Wars.  The effects are pleasing and the plot is just as good as the rest.  If you think it's lacking, remember...  it was written over 30 years ago... would you expect Lucas to totally change a vision that's been in his head for so long simply to please over-expectant fans???  I don't, and I'm very happy with his story as it is.
B000031WD9|5.0|when i first heard of this film, i thought, \\"oh no, not another raunchy teen sex film,\\" and dismissed it. then i decided to rent it and see what it was all about. i was actually quite impressed with both the acting and the script. while some parts were a bit raunchier than i would endure in films, overall, the film does a really good job at explaining and dealing with sex for teenagers these days. I had thought American Pie would turn out to be another version of Porky's, one of the most truly despicable films ever made. but it actually turned out to be intelligent and thoughtful. <br />The highlight of the film is when Nadia goes to Jim's house to \\"study.\\" it is one of the best scenes in modern filmwork for suspense and laughter. <br />Overall it is a great film worth seeing at least once. Also check out the sequel, American Pie 2, which continues the adventures of the gang at the same or even better level.
B00005QG9J|5.0|first of all.  G MONEY. i mean, i was nothin' but bumpin and a grindin to this SH*T. words cannot describe how strong my feelings are for this cd. i listen to it everymorning when i wake up, adn it just gets me ready to take on the world.
6305311463|3.0|those two guys know how to tap into our emotions. i keep feeling like i want to enjoy this movie, like i have to enjoy it. if i dont enjoy it, i'm a fool. but the story isnt all that good. and scientifically incorrect. that's why i give it three stars instead of what i'm &quot;supposed&quot; to give it, five.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Being stuck in Utah for the last 3 years, I thought Kylie was gone!  I was dumbfounded when I heard she was so big back home in UK.  Glad to see her back!<br />Bought the album the day I heard - never had it out of my cd player since!  Dancefloor, Cant get you out of my head and burning up definatley deserve awards!  Kylie is a babe, and her music gets better every time!<br />Cheers!
B00005UW7V|5.0|when i first watched this film at theatres, i was not impressed with it. but then i rented it a short while back and found that i understood more of it than i did the first time. it turns out that the mixture of two very different directors actually did work out well. you can feel the steely coldness of stanley kubrick in many scenes and the cheesy warmth of steven spielberg in other scenes and they actually match up quite well. <br />I am impressed with this film based on the very first scene where the doctor philosophizes with his class about the idea of love. can an android, a robot, show love? more importantly, can the human show love back to the robot? and then they went on to a bigger discussion about our own humanity and whether or not we love our Creator. <br />this film is worth more than the criticism it has received. Kubrick has always wanted us to think beyond the box whenever he made his films, and this one does the same. maybe the fact that it is intermixed with the more heavy-handed Spielberg is stopping some of us from questioning the way Kubrick wanted, but that shouldnt be an excuse.
B00005V0X5|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE MEGADETH FAN AND I FEEL THEY HAVE MANNAGED TO PUT THEIR THUMB ON THE PULS OF HEAVY METAL<BR>FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE SICK OF HEARING THE SAME OLD [music]THIS ALBUM MAY BE THE TICKET.<BR>YOU MAY HAVE TO LISTEN MORE THAN ONCE BUT IT'S ALL THERE.<BR>MASTERFUL GUITAR WORK ALONG WITH LYRICS THAT GET YOUR ATTENTION<BR>A THUNDEROUSE BASS ALONG WITH MELODY WICH WAS LACKING IN THE EARLY DAYS.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from the first time i saw it on video. it is a well acted film and well written film. it is a quasi-autobiographical story of a 15-year-old boy who loves rock and roll and gets to write articles for Rolling Stone magazine. talk about a cool job! the different characters are well rounded, showing their faults as well as their strengths, making them more human than in many other films out there. and for anyone who loves Led Zeppelin or any other 70s rock band, this film is dedicated to you.
B000002HEP|4.0|Amazing.  Let me start by saying I am NOT a heavy metal fan.  My primary listening tastes lie in New Age, Jazz, and Classical.  But I listen to a little bit of everything, and Sky Valley is that little bit that can satisfy the hungriest of Heavy Metal listeners.<br />Minus the gratuitous Whitewater track, the album is reminiscent of Black Sabbath in many ways, with a composition that also twangs of Jimmy Page (with a sweet-sounding distortion).  No room for pleasantries on this album.  Kyuss presses the accelerator to the floor and does not let up until the last track which detracts from the album, but will please most teenagers looking for a little toilet humor.<br />The guitar work is phenomenal on this album.  I hear Ozzy Osborne and Randy Rhodes from Paranoid on Sky Valley, which is perhaps why I like Kyuss.  The music is sentimental heavy metal.  The vocals just your good ole' garage band style singing.  Oldschool if you will.  Pre-glamour rock.  And that's just the way I like it ... pure heavy metal, without the hairspray and rhinestones.
0783225733|5.0|I enjoyed watching this film, showcasing the troubles of the apollo flight to the moon. i dont think i can add much more than what others have said, but will just say that it skillfully combines a great story with suspense and deep characterizations. <br />Overall, well done.
B000002H2H|5.0|First of all, let me say that all the nu-metal bands out there or should i just say all that trendy music out there are maybe classified as the best of metal but it's just because all of the trends just waste time into listening to radio stuff. <BR>Ok, enough of that. I've been a Metallica fan for about 3 years and i own every album and i should have to say that 'Ride the Lightning' is their second best after 'Master of Puppets'. It is a classic outstanding album that is enjoyed from beginning to end starting from their heaviest song in the album, \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" to possibly their best instrumental \\"Call of the Ktulu.\\" Kirk Hammett remains as the best lead guitarist of all time. Other great guitarists are Kerry King, Dimebag Darrell, and Toni Iommi. i have to say that my favorite song in it is \\"Creeping Death\\" because it has a great rhythm and the lyrics are powerful and well the solo is great as well as all the solos. For any new Metallica fans, this and 'Puppets' would be the first two albums to buy.
B00005NRNB|4.0|Air Force One has been hijacked by terrorists demanding a great deal from the president. they hoped to find him in the plane, but not the way they had hoped. the acting is great in this film by both harrison ford and gary oldman. gary oldman will be the Christopher Lee of the future, always playing the bad guy, but always getting a part in a movie. the most powerful scene in the movie is when the president has to decide on the fate of his family. is national security more important than his own family?
B000002JOH|5.0|Well, many pantera fans describe as 'Far Beyond Driven' as the best and i should say that different fans have different opinions. 'Far Beyond Driven' is the heaviest but it doesn't have the Power of VDOP. In my opinion, 'Vulgar' and 'Cowboys From Hell' are my favorites even though they both sound very different. Darrell will remain as probably the best guitarist of all time. And Kirk Hammett too. But overall, this album truly ... from beginning to end. Pantera will remain victorious over all those nu-metals that try to sound heavy and look evil even though THEY ARE NOT. For new pantera fans, this would be a great start. Their latest album is also great.
B00005UW9T|5.0|this is a great film, and another addition to the classics that have dealth with the painful russian revolution of 1917. it is truly amazing how much that revolution changed the face of the world throughout the 20th century. <br />this film also has some great music, including \\"Once upon a December.\\" for me, though, i didnt really like the \\"Gay Paree\\" song very much. i kept feeling like looking at my watch, hoping that song would end. but that is the only fault i find with this film. it otherwise is quite good and for all to enjoy.
B000063CPL|4.0|Iron Maiden has certainly rekindled my interest in metal the last 2 years. Brave New World was an excellent cd and the tour was great(saw the MSG show). This live album is full of the typical Maiden energy and crowd enthusiasm. Unfortunately I feel Janicks guitar work is too sloppy for Maiden. I can't even listen to Hallowed on this cd! Back in the 80's, his poor technique wouldn't have gotten him in a cover band.
6305313687|5.0|this was a powerful film that sent a real tough but good message out about hate groups. in the end it comes back to haunt the ones involved. i was truly saddened by the ending of the film and hoped that wouldnt have happened.
B00003CXI1|2.0|The first Harry Potter film sold over 1.5 million videos and DVDs in its first day of release in the UK, breaking the previous impressive record held by Titanic. Now of course all these people, and their families, would have seen the film in the cinema and have enjoyed Christopher Columbus's excellent adaptation of one of the most succesfful books of the last century. They would have been gripped to the screen, just like myself, as we saw JK Rowling's incredible imagination come to life. The film is, in my humble opinion, a revelation. An example of how the medium of film can awe an audience, transport them to another world and entertain them for a few hours. It is escapism in the truest form. There's only one problem. The DVD [is bad].<br />The film has now surpassed The Phantom Menace as the second most successful film of all time. Warner have therefore spent an awful lot of money on this DVD production (and it shows). They clearly want to give us fans something to sink our teeth into, a DVD like no other, and one that would simply put to shame the conventional DVDs we have now grown accustomed to. But as they dived into complicated navigations and interactive menus they forgot about the elementary yet effective delights of Making Of Documentaries and commentaries. I cannot find a valid excuse why Warner would want to deprive us of a filmmakers commentary. The sets, effects, casting, direction, music, sound etc are of the highest quality and no doubt the people who contributed to this film would have been proud to share with us how the production was made. Commentaries are the most popular & SIGNIFICANT features on DVDs, and probably one of the cheaper features to make, so not even seeing ONE present on this 2 Disc \\"Special Edition\\" package is a disappointment to say the least. <br />The interviews with the director and producer are very good but are too brief. Why have the people who made this DVD been so slack with the basics? There must be hundreds of hours worth of Making Of footage lying around in the Warner vaults. An inch of it barely makes it onto these discs.<br />Of course there is the much talked about guided tour of Hogwarts, and this is where the DVD gets really messy. You get to direct yourself around certain sets. Using the arrows on your DVD's remote you can go left, right and forward at certain moments, and you can select objects on the screen to activate a voiceover which gives us a description. For instance, if you click on Hagrid's large cloak whilst in his hut the voiceover says what it contains and so on. I have to say that the idea is excellent. The intentions were in the right place but the tour becomes boring. It is not like a video game either where you can go wherever you want. You navigate yourself according to arrows, which restrict you to a certain area, and once you have completed the tour I guarantee you that it will not be half as interesting the second time round. It is quite laborious. And this is why I am calling this the first DVD flop. Sure, it will make millions, but only because of the film itself. The features are simply pointless. An experiment that went wrong. And to compund how poorly the navigation is I have yet to even see the deleted scenes. I can't find them. There isn't a simply button that says \\"Deleted scenes - click here\\" but different rooms and tests that I mast trawl through to access them.<br />This said I would still recommend you buy it. Why? Because the film has never looked or sounded this good. The picture quality is perfect, and as the film is such a visual feast the picture transfer is actually important. The plus $120 million spent on the film is justified when you see Hogwarts for the first time. It is a glorious sight and I will be the first to say far better than what I imagined it to be. Now when I read the Potter books I often substitute the film's interpretations for my own because they are more vivid. Then you have the glorious digital 5.1 soundtrack. Theatmosphere created makes your hairs stand on end, and when the Quidditch game takes place you hear sounds whizzing by your ears. Great stuff!<br />I was expecting a DVD similar to The Phantom Menace. Instead it is second rate, trying to pass itself off as a CD-ROM. Thinking about it why didn't they just do that! The kids will like it, but will grow bored very quickly. Over $20 million was spent on the production of this DVD, making it one of, if not the most expensive DVD ever made. It is a disappointment. That my friends is what I call a flop. The irony, considering what the film went on to do at the box office. Now lets hope Warner will consider making a more conventional, but EFFECTIVE and INFORMATIVE DVD in the near future, maybe in time for Christmas. Well what do you know, maybe Warner wanted it to be like this all along!
0783231202|4.0|this movie is an important movie with a sincere and painful look at the slave trade america was involved in early in our history. while the acting was top notch, the film did feel a bit heavy-handed---it is spielberg after all---and it didnt seem to have a true plot to it.
B0000668IF|4.0|Everyone said, including Moby, that this album was influenced by 9/11 and looking at the context of history since Play (a TV commercial inspiring blissfull dot.com nineties album)you can understand where 18 is coming from. <br />18 is good but in a much more down tempo, chilled out, spacious kind of way. It has more of an inward feeling than Play does despite many of the tracks being very reminiscient of Play.  18 is an extension (not a new direction) for Moby and everyone should be able to understand that Moby has changed just like all of us have.
6305364613|3.0|i'm a great fan of Baz Luhrman, but i did not enjoy this film. it seemed way too melodramatic and violent for me. i know he was trying to convey the idea of words in this, his second film of the Red Curtain trilogy--which includes Strictly Ballroom for dance, and Moulin Rouge for music. it was just too violent for me.
B000002KIE|5.0|I haven't listened to this CD since the early 80's. Then I saw the film \\"The Filth and the Fury\\" that chronicles the rise and demise of the Sex Pisols. It made me revisit this totally great and groundbreaking album. This is where it started, folks. If you're younger and want to know the origin of that anti-establishment music you listen to, here it is. I highly reccommend watching \\"The Filth and the Fury\\" - it's entertaining and it gives you insight into how punk started and how it soon became a marketing tool.
B00000IQW5|4.0|one of the complaints i do have of Speilberg is that he does get cheesy in his films. this one is probably one of his cheesiest. it is a well done film and has some great acting. plus i'm a big fan of stories dealing with the afterlife. it's a great reminder to us all that life doesnt end at death. but it gets cheesy as the film progresses.
6301966015|5.0|Memories of David Hemmings astride the statuesque Veruschka, Gawd!  This ground-breaking thriller [?] by Antonioni views like a 'Who's Who?' of Beautiful People circa 1965/6.  Superb art direction and color choices from brilliant vermilion to the seductive and so dangerous velvety black 'midnight park' tones.  It's beautiful child David Hemmings as the pop photographer spying on loved ones in the park and finding something sinister in the underbrush, perhaps ....  a body?<br />Spectacular Vanessa Redgrave as the slightly neurotic mystery woman in search of 'those negatives' from Hemmings 'shows' what's it's all about [still does!]<br />AND that odd ending - aaah, it's all in the eye of the beholder!<br />Antonioni imitators abound - but there's only one master!<br />Tennis anyone?
B0000634EV|4.0|In contrast to the musical vandals that have littered the hard rock landscape, Down II are purveyors of old-fashioned skull crushing metal. This is the kind of music that I didn't think people made anymore; pure beef riffage, screaming guitar solos, pounding, busy drumming, and classic metal vocals. All of this is combined with a lurking Southern Rock sensibility that makes the material just a little unique. The song titles alone are worth it: \\"Lysergic Funeral Procession\\", \\"Doob Interlude\\", and especially \\"New Orleans is a Dying Whore.\\" Absolutely excellent, explosive stuff.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I personally loved the movie and looked forward to getting my hands on the 2-disk DVD for the special features. The interactive menus are extremely clever, and designed most definitely for the younger kids who will get a kick out of attempting to open the portal to Diagon Alley and a few puzzles to access other parts of the special features part on Disk 2. I had to access the books to remember a few details for certain puzzles, which was a bit annoying. The payoff at the end, 7 deleted scenes, was worth a small part on the trouble gone to.<br />What is disappointing and missing is a director commentary track on the movie, as well as any technical aspects outside of initial storyboard concepts (through yet another puzzle-like page). There were no documentaries outside of a short interview / small glimpse into the production values of making the film (essentially they are interviews with the Producer, Director, the Production Director, and the scriptwriter.<br />It's excellent for the film, which is the real highlight of the DVD. However, someone over at Warner needs to rethink the Special Features category for the adult fans of the series and movie. The DVD is a kids interactive tool, most of the features intended for the kids market. I would like to think that Warner is going to be smart enough to release a revised Speical Edition with all the trimmings, as most high-profile DVDs have (like the commentary, costume design, production value and concepts outside of the brief interviews, the option for audio).<br />Buy it because you love the movie. Unfortunately the special features lack at present.
038533558X|5.0|You can't put this book down from the minute you start reading it.  Just as you think you have it figured out..it turns. I recently began reading Harlan Coben and I was instantly hooked.  He leaves you guessing until the very end.  Highly Recommended!
B00005ASQ1|4.0|Finding Forrester is a movie about a young man from the \\"hood' with an extraordinary talent, and an old recluse author who teaches him how to use it.  This movie was very enjoyable to watch, the only aspects to look out for would be mild swearing.<br />Finding Forrester is directed to an audience who is looking for more than just sex, violence, and explosions in a movie, and definitely succeeds at it.  Sean Connery is a wonderful actor, and this movie is no different. Also the young man who plays Jamal Wallace, the boy with the gift, is a gifted actor, who displays his talent well in this movie.<br /> The whole mood of this movie seems to be shadowy, but there are certain parts that brightens the whole thing up, and the movie also flows well.  It seems to get from problem, to climax, to resolution in a quick, efficient way, while keeping it entertaining.  The movie's main theme is if you have a dream and know the way to get there, you shouldn't let anything get in your way, and shows a very good example of it.  If your someone looking for a good, entertaining movie, without the guns and sex, then Finding Forrester is one movie you need to check out.
0871137380|5.0|The book Blackhawk Down written by Mark Bowden is a great read. It combines a wonderful story of courage with an action packed plot, which makes this book on of the best i've ever read. The story is about a raid on a terrorist and the raid goes bad. The Blackhawk crew gets shot down. The story is about the survival of the Blackhawk crew and the special forces trying to survive and beeting the odds. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes action filled books and or war stories.
B000000WA4|1.0|\\"How can any rock fan not like this?\\" is one reviewers headline. I say, \\"easy, this album [stinks]\\". Oh sure, there are some moments when everything sounds beautiful and uplifting, but that's only when Billy Corgan is'nt singing... The man simply can't sing. His voice is TERRIBLE. And lets be honest here............. there is nothing musically on this record that hasn't been done before, and better for that matter. This is a classic case of 'The Emperors New Clothes'. So many critics have fawned over this band that everyone seems to be afraid to say that this band is not really that good. 'The Emperor is naked' I say...eeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh.......that's the sound of Billy's voice.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This won't be a long review, since a lot of reviews have been written.  All I have to say is....this is a GREAT movie!<br />Having had to endure CBS' made for tv Spider-Man movies in the '70's, this movie is a long time coming.  Finally, the film-makers get the story & characters right, staying true to the comic-book.<br />It helps that Sam Raimi is a Spider-Man fan & his vision & Stan Lee's/Steve Ditko's/John Romita's originals are very close.  (Raimi updated the story to the new millenium from the 1960's comic-book.)<br />Most viewers & ALL comic-book fans will enjoy this movie.  (There was a recent viewer who put this film down while admitting that he's not a Spider-Man fan to begin with.  Well, with all respect, if you feel that comic-books are \\"beneath you\\", then this movie isn't for you.)  But if you want a mature approach to fantasy & action-adventure, then this movie is a dream come true!<br />Let's see if \\"Daredevil\\" & \\"The Hulk\\", scheduled for next year, will be just as good.
B0000640RX|5.0|There was probably a lot of discussions to release this trilogy on DVD, in fact they are already available in one format or another.  But this is what you would call the ultimate edition, encased in a metal casing ala Terminator 2 this is just packed with stuff.<br />Besides the fact that you get one of the best trilogies of all time you also get stuff like an interview with the guy who wrote the story first blood, documentaries galore, and that's just scratching the surface.<br />I have yet to fully explore the depths of this set but there truely is a lot in this.  This was probably a confirmed released after post Sept. 11 but it is so worth it, and at a beutiful price as well.  A must buy.
B000001DYD|3.0|I tended to like the songs on this album not based on their artistic merit (although some are musically amazing) but because of how they mirrored my emotional state at the time. And I think that was Harvey's intent. In constructing emotionally unhinged dramatic monologues like \\"Rid of Me\\" and \\"Fifty Foot Queenie\\" she was engaging in a sort of method-acting therapy; our catharsis comes from watching hers. My favorite song on the album is probably \\"Legs\\", where she sings her lyrics of pain and obsession with a dissonant cello wailing in the background. \\"Fifty Foot Queenie\\" is a raucous jam,  manic and jolting and probably as catchy as it gets in this scratchy landscape. The guitar work in \\"Yuri-G and \\"Missed\\" is also emotionally impactful. Although there are some weak cuts, notably \\"Rub 'Til it Bleeds,\\" which wails and screeches but fails to reach the violent and sensual climaxes of the album's best tracks, and her rickety revamping of the Dylan classic \\"Highway '61 Revisited.\\" For a more polished taste of Harvey's erotic sturm und drang, I recommend \\"Is This Desire\\" or \\"Dry\\". However, if you're in that unique emotional place (and you'll know when you're there) \\"Rid of Me\\" will scratch the itch.
0380789035|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  American Gods was a GREAT BOOK, the like of which has been seldom seen for the last decade.  I don't doubt that it shall spawn a few graphic novels, a film, several volumes of short stories by other major authors in that field, etc.  But, when you get right down to it, I didn't like it as much as most of Gaiman's other works.  It wasn't as dark or as fantastic as Neverwhere, it lacked the atomic punch of most of his better short stories, like Snow, Glass, Apples or Murder Mysteries, and it didn't really have the mythological intricacy of the Sandman series.  I suppose that this is because there wasn't enough TIME in which to develop the story as it deserved to be developed.  So many little storylines seemed broken off.  Others were just completely unneccesary.  Overall, I just got the impression that this might have worked a bit better if it was done as a series, or as a couple of graphic novels.  (Imagine the illustration of the scene where all those dieties gather!)<br />Still, it was written by Gaiman, and and he is unquestionably the master of modern mythology.  So...enjoy!

0440219078|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry deals with a community, which seems to be the perfect world, but it´s a place without any feelings!!!!<br />I recommend the book to all people!!The background is very serios and important, because many people in our world want to reach an Utopia!(no wars, no hunger, no diseases..)but have you ever thougt about the situation then?? Someday you´ll reach the point where no love is existing any more. The consequences of such an Utopia would be a birthcontrol and perhaps a \\"deadcontrol\\", because there would be too many (sounds stupid !) people on earth !! I found the book very interesting and worth reading it!!But I´d never, never, never want to live in such a world...Imagine---they have no feelings. No love, no happiness, no real friendship, no own choice...NO OWN LIFE!!They are just existing, not really living, because everything in their life is \\"planned for them\\". What´s the sense of their life??Is there really a sense?WHY do they live??Everthing is controlled: Love, climate, landscape, job, children...everything!!!The more I read the book, the more I liked it. I´m german, but at the end it was so easy to read as a german book.I hope that our world will never become such a place to live!!Beware the feelings!!!<br />\\"For all the children, to whom we entrust the future!\\"(Lois Lowry)<br />Read it!!!!!!!I recommend the book for everyone, yo guys it´s really worth reading it!
0805047905|5.0|Katrina (1 yr) enjoys hearing this book.  She also has \\"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What do you Hear?\\" and loves it as well.  These pictures are simplistic and easy for her to remember.  This book is loads of fun when special voices are used for the different animals and sound effects.  Also sign language and gestures are great for keeping interest and reinforcing the learning experience.  Just a great book!
B000003S09|5.0|This album, in my mind, is beyond critisizm.  I am a 20 year old music lover who is always looking for something new and exciting, and I certainly found that with In The Court of the Crimson King.  I had never heard anything like this before, a very well thought-out work of art this is.  The compositions on this album are very daring, most people stuck in the Top 40 rut will probably think this is too strange to be true.  But there is some fantastic musicianship here, like the manic first track 21st Century Schitzoid Man, the arrangements on this song have to be heard to be believed.  The songs here have so many tonal contrasts, it's hard to put this album in one genre besides your usual prog-rock or art-rock pretensions, you could classify the first song as heavy jazz with Hendrix overtones, the second and fourth tracks as easy listening.  For those who are in my generation who may put this off as fossil rock, keep this in mind; King Crimson is one of Tool's biggest influences, this album is a great showcase to show you why.  Highly recommended!  Look out for the powerful mid-section in Epitaph, it scared me the first time I heard it, truly magnificent!

Use this opportunity to make funny animal noises with the book and point to your ear and hers when you say, \\"What do you hear?\\".  This book also lends itself well to gestures and sign language.  It is great at involving the readers with the experience.

0375751513|5.0|Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so.
B000003CKH|5.0|At the risk of waxing hyperbolic, it's a good album.  Cake fans and music fans alike will enjoy this album
B000002J03|5.0|to say that this album is heavy metal is truly misinterpret the musical genius that is plant, page, jones and bonham.  from the opening riff of whole lotta love to the spiraling drums of moby dick, this is the quintessential rock album.  anyone who has lost faith in the redemptive power of music should pick up this album, grab a beer and turn up the stereo.  truly this is a masterpeice that combines the sexual desires of robert plant with the musical genius of jimmy page on the guitar and 'bonzo' on the drums.  this could have been their undoing becuase to better this album would have been difficualt, however led zep 3 and 4 are no disgrace to the incandescent wonder of the greatest rock and roll band to have graced planet earth.  sit back and enjoy people, i did and am still revelling in the light of this epic work.
B00005ABIP|5.0|This album is fun.  If you like cake or if you've never heard them before - give this one a shot, you'll enjoy it.  Especially if you like the use of instruments other than just guitar and drums - the horns are fantastic!
B000001E3L|5.0|I'm a huge Van Morrison fan and this is absolutely my favorite album! From the big hit albums like Moondance, to the more hardcore fan albums like The Philosopher's Stone and Back on Top, they all contain some amazing music. However, this live album is really Van at his most amazing. <br />Listen to the nearly 10 minute long &quot;In the Garden/You Send Me/Allegheny&quot; or the 9 minute long &quot;Moondance/My Funny Valentine&quot; and you'll see why he is such a master. The music is perfect for sitting outside on a warm summer evening. You'll feel like you are in that auditorium with him and it is like some kind of musical trance. I also love this version of &quot;Beautiful Vision&quot; and the upbeat &quot;Did Ye Get Healed?&quot;. But I think it is the multiple encores that really cap this off as my favorite Van Morrison CD and one of my &quot;Top 10 Desert Island CDs&quot;! <br />If you love the &quot;feel&quot; of live music, you'll love this album. If you love Van Morrison, you'll love this album. But if you are new to Van Morrison, you may want to check out The Best of Van Morrison first. That too is a fantastic album and probably the best &quot;summary&quot; of his style and his hits. Then once you are hooked, grab this album for some great performances of some of the big hits, plus some more obscure songs.
0385503954|5.0|Atonement, Ian McEwan's ninth novel, is split into three very definite phases.<br />The first phase is very much pastoral modernism (by which I mean that it reads like Renoir's La Regle du Jeu rewritten by Virginia Woolf).  Briony Tallis, a precocious thirteen year old has composed a play (The Trials of Arabella) for her brother Leon, only the preparations for the performance are disrupted by the arrival of her cousins Lola, Jackson and Pierrot from the abstract North (\\"refugees,\\" McEwan writes, \\"from a bitter domestic civil war.\\").  With the play thrown into disarray, Briony sulks in her room - a sulk that allows her to glimpse a very peculiar scene involving her sister Cecilia [taking] off her clothes in the garden before her childhood friend Robbie Turner.  The ambivalent feelings stirred in Briony by the soundless scene she witnesses bring the tiny, polite country world crashing down around their ears before the day is out.  <br />The middle of the book occurs sometime later, in the midst of the Second World War.  Robbie Turner has served the jail time visited upon him as a result of Briony's claims, and  now finds himself in France making the perilous journey towards the beaches at Dunkirk.  He and Cecilia are in love.  She writes to him: \\"They turned on you, all of them, even my father.  When they wrecked your life they wrecked mine.  They chose to believe the evidence of a silly, hysterical little girl.  In fact, they encouraged her by giving her no room to turn back.\\"  Cecilia vows that she will \\"never want to speak to  (Briony) again.\\"  Both of the sisters have become nurses but their relationship will never be as it was.<br />The brief coda (that runs to a length of no more than twenty pages) changes all that we have read up this point.  It is London, 1999.  Briony Tallis is a celebrated novelist, and what we have read has been adapted by her for our consumption.  Yes, these events took place, but not as described here.  This has been a novel.  What truththere has been is outweighed by a tidy neatening of events.  \\"Who would want to believe that they never met again, never fulfilled their love?\\" she writes.  \\"No-one will care what events and which individuals were misrepresented to make a novel.\\"  Her atonement, when it comes, is the attempt to make a better world for the people she was party to the destruction of.  And yet, and yet, \\"how can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?  There is no-one . . . that can forgive her.\\"<br />What you have, what this successive redrawing of boundaries achieves, is both a novel (there are characters, there is a compelling story, there is vivid writing that peels off the page the way the soldier's bandage peels back to reveal raw brain) and a meta-novel (a discussion of the very idea of what a novel could and should constitute, all of which is both enormously thought-provoking and enormously compelling).  While it is untrue to say that McEwan has not written as well elsewhere (Enduring Love, Black Dogs and The Child in Time all spring immediately to mind), there is a certain abstract something to all of this which suggests he has raised his game: Atonement is that rare beast we all look forward to at the beginning of each year: that book which sets the bar for all of the others, that book which says THIS IS A NOVEL, that book which says COMPETE WITH THIS.   <br />This is the book that should have won the 2001 Booker Prize.
0385486804|4.0|Into The Wild, by Jon Krakauer, is the true story of a young man named Chris McCandless, who gave all his money to charity and abandoned his car, most of his possesions, and his family and started a new life for himself.  This book is very interesting because it tells how he travels all over the United States and meets many people and sees many things.  Also, you learn in the beginning of the book that Chris McCandless ends up dying and explains what led up to those events.  This book is very good and gives you insight on what it is like to live in many different places in the United States and it is definitly worth reading.  I would recommend this book to kids middle-school age and up.  I enjoyed reading this book very much and I am presently reading Into Thin Air, another book by Jon Krakauer.
0930289234|5.0|Pilgrimage (which my dictionary defines as a journey to a shrine or sacred place as an act of devotion, in order to acquire spiritual merit, or as part of a process of self-discovery) can take many forms.<br />The Egyptians, for instance, journeyed to Sekket's shrine at Bubastis or to Ammon's oracle at Thebes; the Greeks sought for counsel from Apollo at Delphi and for cures from Asclepius at Epidaurus; the Mexicans gathered at the huge temple of Quetzal; the Peruvians massed in sun-worship at Cuzco and the Bolivians in Titicaca.  Huge gatherings of people intermittently all the year round venerate Kapilavastu where Gaukama Buddha began his life, Benares where he opened his sacred mission, Kasinagara where he died; and Mecca and Medina have become almost bywords in English as the goals of long aspirations, so famous are they for their connexion with the prophet of Islam.<br />Me?  I just re-read Watchmen.<br />Okay, I don't have to walk as far as regular pilgrims do (the distance from my chair to my bookshelf), but the act is at least as holy, I am at least as devout.  Watchmen is my shrine or sacred place.  Reading Watchmen is my act of devotion.  Through Watchmen I acquire spiritual merit (at least in my own eyes).  Reading Watchmen is part of my process of self-discovery.<br />If you know Watchmen, you'll understand why I feel the way I do.<br />If you don't (if you've been worshipping the sun at Cuzco, for instance, or the Gaukama Buddha at Kapilavastu), it's probably best if we start at the beginning.<br />It is 1985, and we live in a world that has known superheroes for thirty years or more.  Years ago, the public loved them, years ago when superheroes meant Minutemen.  But that was a long time ago.  Now there's legislation.  Superheroes aren't something that the Government want to encourage.  That's why the Watchmen had to disband.  And yet it seems that disbanding isn't enough for some people because some people - who we don't know - want the Watchmen dead .. . Rorshach (who is sort of a skinny Philip Seymour Hoffman playing Judge Dredd as Ignatius T Reilly), who is probably the finest invention within a graphic novel ever (far outstripping Miller's Dark Knight and  Morrison's Invisibles and Gaiman's Sandman and anybody else you'd care to mention), is on the case but whether he'll be able to find out who the perp is before the world ends . . . That's another matter altogether . . .<br />The use of TV, the various clocks that appear throughout (with the minute finger edging ever closer to the white nuclear midnight), the character of Rorshach (you keep coming back to that), the ketchup-streaked smiley face, the white frames, the colour, the pirate ship, the horror (the horror) . . . I could go on (and would at the least invitation). Watchmen is the first word in graphic novels, the first word.  If there was a word that could somehow suggest something was MORE than essential, that would be the word I would say to you now (and the word would trigger a Manchurian Candidate-style response from you, such that you rise from your seat and don't stop until you hold in your hands a copy of Watchmen).<br />This is the Daddy.
0446608955|5.0|I didn't really know at first, which book I should choose and which book could be the best for me. So I went in the next bookshop and found there some books from Nicholas Sparks. I read the resume on the back which informed me that this story is about a 40-year old man looking back on his first and possibly deepest love he had ever had. This sounds very nice to me and so I decided to take this book `A Walk to Remember' for the reading project. As soon as I arrived at home I started reading this book and I was very impressed. I couldn't put this book down once I started to read it. <BR>When I was seventeen, my life changed forever. So begins `A Walk to Remember', the touching tale of Landon Carter, a typical teenage boy living in Beaufort, North Carolina, in 1958. He wants to spend as little time as possible in school and as much time as possible with his friends before going off to college. He's not likely, even in the small town of Beaufort, to cross paths with Jamie Sullivan, the Baptist minister's daughter who spends her lunch hour reading the Bible, her afternoons volunteering at an orphanage, and her summers at church camp. On the evening of Beaufort's annual Christmas pageant, Landon's and Jamie's lives are linked together, and Landon undergoes a change that will forever alter the course of his life. In the months that follows, he discovers the truths about the nature of beauty, the joy of giving, the pain of loss, and most of all, the power of love.<BR>I can't really say what part of the book I liked mostly because I liked every part. Every page is something special where you learn more about the story. As the book is written very simply I didn't have to read the book for a second time to understand the content. The author used also words I have already known and so I have had to use the dictionary very seldom. <BR>I really can say that I have never before read such a good book as this one. As I was so impressed about the content of the story I used the Internet to find out more about the author and his other books. Now as I know that Nicholas Sparks is the author of some of today's most memorable love stories. I will also read some of his other books like `A Bend in the Road', `The Notebook' or `Message in a Bottle'. Although this story is a wonderful little teen romance. I would not like to recommend it only to teenagers but also to adults. As Nicholas Sparks gives a remarkable love story in `A Walk to Remember', it will touch the hearts of readers everywhere. So I am convinced that everybody who is keen on love stories will also love this book.
B00005ASOC|3.0|Finding Forester is a Gus Van Zant filmed released in 2000, and starring Rob Brown, Sean Connery, and F. Murrey Abraham.<BR>In the film, Brown plays Jamal Wallace, a talented high school basketball player and gifted writer from the Bronx. In a starnge twist of fate, a dare brings him into contact with William Forrester (Connery) a shut in writer with only one literary masterpiece. Forrest becomes Jamal's writing teacher, and helps him negotiate with the politics of Jamal's new private school and his conflict with teacher(Abraham).<BR>This movie was pleasant enough, stressing important themes such as the price of fame and expectations, the burdens of talent, and the ultimate importance of education.<BR>Watching this movie I was reminded too much of Van Zant's other old man/young man friendship film, Good Will Hunting. These movies are different in many ways, but overall there was just too much of a connection for me. I kept wondering when Robin Williams was going to walk on to the film and say, &quot;It's not your fault.&quot;<BR>The cast is quite effective, and newcomer Rob Brown is very believable as the budding genius. F. Murrey Abraham is good as the nasty teacher, but Sean Connery, who also produced this film, steals every scene he is in. Connery's energy and knack for turning the grinch into a father-figure make his work outstanding. This is a nice, watchable film but if you like it, definatly check out some of Van Zant's earlier work, such as Good Will Hunting, or Drugstore Cowboy.
B00004YA0T|5.0|Finding that no other complete series of Bruckner's symphonies is recommended more highly than this, in each comparative review I have read, I was happy to procure this compact little box of 9 CDs and to climb the nine mountains, as it were, of Bruckner's creation.<br />Although I have heard most of the symphonies in performance fairly recently, I can't claim to be an authority on them, their various editors or particular points of interpretation.  A few discussion ideas might prompt other reviewers to respond, however.<br />A comment offered by someone at a concert recently, where one of the symphonies was about to be performed, went like this: \\"Bruckner's symphonies - you've heard one you've heard them all!\\"  Can anyone demonstrate that this is merely a lazy, superficial judgment?  I find the orchestral textures of all the symphonies to be indistinguishable.  I find it easy to predict \\"where he will go next\\".  I would possibly fail to notice if the scherzo movement of one symphony were swapped with the scherzo movement of another.  It is as if, having found a formula that suited his needs, Bruckner never varied it.<br />Another comment, made actually by someone who failed to attend scheduled concert performances, went like this: \\"The prospect of sitting through such long works, with some movements lasting longer than half an hour, is too daunting\\".  With this I do not agree.  Given a normal healthy concentration span, a listener will not hear difficult or discordant or shapeless music.  Persevere, listen with an open mind and open ears, and you will encounter works of great beauty.<br />All of which should add to my recommendation of this, the second complete recording of the symphonies made under the direction of conductor Eugen Jochum.

B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is as close to combat as film can get.<br />Based on a wonderful book, the adaptation is pretty loyal (although of neccesity simplified.)<br />Critiques are mostly misplaced. It is true politics are presented in a simplified fashion-but this is a story of war, and enough of the politics are shown to contextualize the story for the historicly challenged (99 percent of American's) while not detracting from the story.<br />I think the most pointless critique I have heard is \\"Gee, did we win or lose? Was it worth it or not? I left confused!\\"<br />CONGRATS!!!<br />Those folks got one of the main politicalpoints ofthemovie, without realizing it. That is rather the point of the movie...<br />Plus points: Realistic combat.<BR>             <BR>Neg points: Poor charactor development.<BR>            <BR>I am pre-ordering the DVD, which I have only done once before (for Lord of the Rings..)
0930289234|4.0|While Watchmen's reputation as the pinnacle of the art form is grossly exaggerated, it puts forth a powerful argument in favor of the literary potential of comic books. Dave Gibbons' artwork is brilliant in its clarity. The subtly of each characters gestures and movements should serve as a lesson to the popular school of comic artists who favor crude visceral bursts of color and speed lines. You will have to re-read Watchmen again and again, just to catch all the detail in Alan Moore's meticulously crafted script. Unfortunately, it has the occasional air of self-importance. Some bits of supposed symbolism are puny, little more than puns or double entendres. Still, this is a fairly minor fault to one of the most ambitious modern comic series that is well worth its price.
B0000668IF|3.0|I went on a limb and picked up 18 having good faith in Moby rather than reading up on this title before making my selection. I'm not disappointed that I did that. However, I think I would have turned to Kazaa to get these tracks, rather than plunk down my hard-spent cash.<br />Why?<br />Moby is a modern musical omelette man. And I love omelettes. BUT, you can only have so many before you get sick of them (and they have a lot of cholesterol anyway). These 18 tracks (picked from Moby's repertoire of over 3000 similar numbers) are made from the same basic ingredients as the tracks from Play: strings, synth, drums, and an occassional pumpin bass line. This time though, it seems like the variations from track to track fail to deliver a distinctive flavor for each song and instead you're left with the feeling that you either just ate 18 fried eggs or the world's largest cheese omelette.<br />I give the man credit for doing what he does well, but these 18 tracks are more like the B-Sides to Play. They're Moby's own special recipe but the rest of us just don't quite have the same taste buds as him. Oh well. At least I'm not hungry anymore.
B00004SU5J|4.0|This CD is a very pleasant surprise.  Again and again, Europe shows the way how to fuse Jazz with Cuban with Latin with House...you get the picture.  This CD is one of the few that you will find yourself listening to again and again, always discovering new things about it.  There is a flood of all things housey-jazzey right now, but Tourist will stay right up there as the CD that deserves the respect, not just the hype.
B000003C2U|5.0|All jokes aside, this album deserves six stars if there were that many. When I first heard \\"Lack of Comprehension\\" in 1995, I heard something I never haerd before, and that was unsurpassed musicianship mxed perfectly with sheer brutality. This one album was also the main reason I became a metalhead in the first place. With the opener \\"Flattening of Emtions\\", immediately the drum timing is enough to make you have a brain anurism....all the way through to the last track. The Guitar work is also notable for it's severe disharmonic perfection, as well as accenting each song with original riffing and no repetitiveness. ... No filler material here. I would reccomend this album to anyone who is just starting to get into death metal, because this is a timeless album. Even after seven years of owning it, I could still spin it all the way through. The only other album that could come close to this level is Indicidual Thought Patterns\\", also by Death.  R.I.P. Chuck.....
B00005QIPH|5.0|Sometimes I hear an album which everyone says is brilliant, and have to strain terribly hard to figure out why it's supposed to be so great.  With the Strokes, I've found myself doing the opposite.  I've tried from every angle to try to figure out why so many of the people writing here think this album's junk, and just can't see how this is anything but a really great band.<br />This is a pretty deceptively simple group, mind you.  The songs are all written in a very standard A-A-B-A song structure.  Hardly any of the tracks divert from the same punk rhythm used throughout the whole album.  The vocals are simple, plaintive and sometimes lacking in spontenaeity.  There are almost no improvisational or unscripted moments, save a few simple guitar riffs here and there.  The album's producer seems almost completely AWOL.<br />But despite this, and despite their supposed lack of originality, the Strokes simply write some of the best songs I've ever heard.  Not clever songs, mind you, nor songs that are interesting to dissect, but really passionate displays of sexual and artistic energy.  Their chord progressions are romantic, their rhythm intense, and that's all that matters to me.  These are a bunch of repressed rich kids who feel like loosening their shirts a little and indulgin a little bit, and the results are magnificent.<br />No their sound is not all that original.  But searching for nothing BUT an original sound can be dangerous--that's how overrated stuff like the White Stripes and that stale new Wilco album get labeled as genius.  If you want artsy, experimental rock, there are plenty of great bands like the Shins and Radiohead (probably too popular for this crowd).  If, however, you're willing to check your intellect at the door, you'll find the Strokes is the most exciting band to come out in a decade.
B000002534|5.0|Borboletta is a continuation of Carlos Santana's focus on jazz, beginning with Caravanserai and partially interrupted with the more-laid-back Welcome.  As in Caravanserai, the majority of the tracks (7 of 12) contain no verselines.  Two of the numbers with lyrics--\\"Life Is Anew\\" and \\"Practice What You Preach\\"--reflect a nod toward gospel, and \\"Give and Take\\" has a funky texture.  The verselines are so-so, lesser than those on Caravanserai.  Still, between the inconsequential first and last tracks, all of the songs have jazzy soloing that ranges from very good to breathtaking.<br />Indeed, Borboletta reflects a diversity of talent that appeared on it, in a period of transition for the Santana Band.  Percussionists Michael Shrieve and Chepito Areas were soon to be on new paths. However, jazz keyboardist Tom Coster and percussionist Armando Peraza had debuted with the group very successfully on Caravanserai, and continued their fine performances here.  Coster's piano notes highlight the beautiful \\"Canto De Los Flores.\\"  But Borboletta also has the key inclusions of two Brazilian percussionists and a Brazilian lady who supplies glowing choral vocals on the wonderful instrumental \\"Promise of a Fisherman.\\"  The flow of instrumentation from the Coltranesque \\"Here and Now\\" through \\"Flor De Canela\\" and climaxing with this Brazilian-textured masterwork is one of the most fantastic displays of heavenly musicianship Santana has ever displayed.  Of equal stature is the instrumental \\"Aspirations,\\" lovely, free-flowing modern jazz, with Coster's radiant organ and fabulous saxophone work by Jules Broussard.  Carlos' guitar work on this album is terrific from start to finish, among his best, and the percussion section shines all the way as well (hardly a surprise).  Borboletta is one of Santana's finest recordings, an instrumental tour de force, absolutely wonderful to listen to.
B00005YXZH|3.0|This is probably the most brilliantly produced album I've ever heard.  The ambient sounds fit perfectly with intrumentation, which is often haunting.  Each track has a new and unique texture to it.  But ...<br />Where are the songs?  Almost all of the songs on this album are so underwritten that they almost aren't even songs--they're just instrumental frameworks in which a song SHOULD be embedded.  Sometimes, as in &quot;Radio Cure,&quot; the this framework is so genius that you almost forget that Tweedy does little more than repeat the same stanza over and over again.<br />And that might be great, if he had written one heck of an amazing stanza.  But most of the songwriting isn't much above the level of a very smart fifteen-year-old kid.  If Tweedy had even a somewhat mature sensibility as a songwriter, this album might have been pure gold.  But as it is, it leaves you with a hollow aftertaste.
B00000254Q|3.0|Amigos features two solid instrumentals, the most noteworthy being \\"Europa,\\" one of Carlos' trademark guitar works.  Starting with pretty high-pitched twangs, it evolves into a potent solo in the Santana tradition.  The group also displays its musical talents well in \\"Take Me With You.\\"  For the rest (except for an interesting flamenco intro on \\"Gitano\\"), Amigos represents the beginning of the slippage from Santana's top-notch studio album work that began after Borboletta and has continued to this day (with the exception of the studio cuts on Moonflower, released shortly after Amigos).  Tom Coster's keyboards are radiant enough, and Armando Peraza still does it with his bongos and conga, but the song quality and overall instrumentation do not measure up to the old standards.  They reflect a shift to more-plain-sounding or less-refined Latin verselines and music or so-so funk, to later become mediocre at best.  It should also be noted that \\"Europa\\" and \\"Take Me With You\\" are somewhat derivative of \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" and \\"Incident at Neshabur,\\" respectively, hinting that the great Mexican guitarist's inspiration was beginning to wane.  Amigos is still decent, if unimpressive, but the latter term can in no way be linked to Santana's earlier works, and he was never again able to produce anything good except on a sporadic basis.
B000002NFM|1.0|\\"The Prodigy\\" must be one of the most ironic title given to a group of musicians, as these guys' productions are totally brainless garbage. I cannot understand how anyone could consider these guys as serious electronic musicians. Inspiring millions of other trashy skateboarder themes world-wide, the music goes no further than repeated curse words and ever-nausiating *boom, boom, boom*. The only thing that distinguishes their music from all the [lower quality] punk bands out there is that these guys torture their drum machines instead of actual drums.
B000002505|4.0|Members of Carlos Santana's Band and John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Group express spiritual themes through their jazz-rock talents in Love, Devotion and Surrender, with great success. This effort reflected Carlos' having come under the influence of Sri Chinmoy, John's spiritual guru. \\"Naima\\" and \\"Meditation\\" are lighter, pretty acoustic tracks that contrast with the intensity of the other three. Both guitarists jam vigorously around the four-syllable chant of John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" and the eight-syllable chants in \\"The Life Divine.\\" In \\"Let Us Go Into The House of the Lord,\\" they deliver blistering gospel soloing, but just as much a highlight is the fast-paced conga drumming of Armando Peraza, certainly mesmerizing, and isn't the \\"hypnotic\\" characterization usually reserved for nonpercussion instruments? The organ of Larry Young glows very nicely as a component of the spiritual texture, but he also solos well on the aforementioned track. Love, Devotion and Surrender is in line with what you expect from Santana's earlier-period music: great potent guitar work by Carlos, pretty music, and superb musicianship from all involved.
B0000667RO|5.0|It's another collection of Bryan Adams tunes.  Are we happy?  Are we rejoicing?<br />You bet!!!!<br />This is BA at his best.  Though a longtime country fan, I just got into Bryan Adams recently.  I must tell you that I enjoy his work immensely, as he is a talented singer/songwriter/instrumentalist.  His voice is unique, and you know it's Bryan Adams whenver he comes on the radio!<br />Back to this album.  I won't go song-for-song, but I will tell you the \\"best of the Best\\", so to speak.  There are the acoustical \\"I'm Ready\\" and \\"Back To You,\\" of course.  \\"Summer of '69,\\" \\"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\\", and \\"Please Forgive Me\\" are still good.  There is a re-vamped version of \\"Cloud Number Nine,\\" as well as the sexy \\"Let's Make a Night To Remember.\\"  \\"When You're Gone\\" features Melanie C., and \\"All For Love\\"--tied for the best Adams song ever--sports two other well-known artists; get ready...Rod Stewart and Sting!  \\"Inside Out\\" is much better than Trisha Yearwood's country version, and \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\\" is still hip.  The other best Adams song is, of course, \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You.\\"<br />I could go on and on, but then I might bore you so much you'd take this pitiful review to heart and not buy the CD.  Please don't judge Bryan Adams' talent by my way with words.  He deserves much more than this review gives him.  I can only say one more thing, really, without being too tacky: How can you not by the BEST?  Buy it!  But it!  Buy it!  (You really won't regret it, honestly).
B000031XCR|3.0|Since her American career started in the early 90's, Celine Dion has become a monarch of pop music today. Her beautiful voice, and tough determination still continues to rock the music world.<br />Her 1999 Greatest Hits album, All The Way: A Decade Of Song consists of nine of her greatest hits from her six English studio albums: Unison, Celine Dion, The Colour Of My Love, Let's Talk About Love, Falling Into You, and These Are Special Times. Although her standards come out like My Heart Will Go On, Because You Loved Me, and The Power Of Love are in this collection, there were so many songs that didn't get into this collection, like her duet with Barbara Streisand, Tell Him, Where Does My Heart Beat Now, and When I Fall In Love, from Sleepless In Seattle.<br />Although Celine has became the biggest selling female artist of all time, this collection is hardly up to those expectations. Nonetheless, for any Celine fan this collection might be worth the dollar.
B00005B36H|5.0|It is impossible to describe any of Tool's cd-s.<BR>I can only say that there is no band like Tool, and every other band seems like an error when you listen to Tool. Lateralus deserves more than 5 stars.
B000065U1N|4.0|You leave the theatre exhausted having just been bombarded by 2 hours of non-stop violence and action. This movie just doesn't let up... most movies have some side-plots... this one really doesn't. It's about one battle. That's it. No lovey-dovey \\"Pearl Harbor\\"ish sidebar. Now, this is not such a bad thing... my only major gripe was that there was so little character development that, and I hate to say this, you just don't CARE about these guys dying... and since everyone has the same uniform and haircut, most of the time you just don't know who it was that just got killed, adding to your growing ambivalence. Still, an interesting movie... probably one of the best war movies every portrayed on screen purely based on the confusion and gruesomeness of what war truly is.
6304779356|4.0|This is one of the best vampire films ever made.  It was a departure from the typical horror junk that was being made at the time (Fright Night), and successfully portrayed the romantic image of vampires on film.  I have to qualify that, since romantic can be interpreted all sorts of different ways.  These are not just beautiful vampires, they are also charming, exciting, interesting, and virile.  Rather than the movies of the past, where the vampire was seen as a threatening, malevolent force, we want to be like these vampires.  This is a cross between Dracula and James Dean.<BR>The story moves along, the acting is on par with the subject matter, and the humor keeps the movie from bogging itself down.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Brad Pitt sums it up best in the DVD edition of Legends of the Fall. It's the way a movie should be made, and it was made superbly. Set in Montana and thereabouts, Legends is about a family on the verge of WW1, who are very passionate and genuine, living in a seemingly distant far away world, somewhere in the vast country, in an era of discontent, because of wars, and rumors of wars. The musical score by James Horner really captures the whole surrounding and emotion that Legends brings. I'm sure many others have gotten the plot down. <BR>( Originally a novella by Jim Harrison.)<BR>So I will talk about the DVD. The DVD is a great buy, I just purchased it the other day. For the money, it is worth it, though I was a little disappointed at the length of the Featruette. <br />SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:<BR>*Edward Zwick and Brad Pitt audio commentary<BR>*Cinematographer John Toll and Production Designer Lilly Kilvert audio commentary <BR>*Production Design featurette<BR>*Original making-of featurette<BR>* 3 DELETED SCENES with audio commentary<BR>*Isolated musical score with audio commentary<BR>( though Horner doesn't say a word )<BR>*Theatrical trailers &amp; Talent Files<BR>*Production Notes<br />The rest is just menus, video and sound quality, subtitles (english, french, spanish, porteguese, chinese, korean, and thai) and multilanguage audio. And it's WIDESCREEN<br />Hope you got some info, i highly recommend the DVD! - Jeffro
0800177177|2.0|I'll admit it, I'm a Stoker purist.  I think Dracula is the greatest work of vampire fiction in existence.  I thought that this was the movie I was waiting for, since so many others had done such a bad job of adapting the book.<BR>When I got to the voice-over line &quot;contrary to popular misconception, the vampire can go about in daylight...&quot; (or something like that) I pretty much knew that the movie had taken a left turn.  The addition of Stoker's name to the title, seems a desperate attempt at legitimizing a complete bastardization of an otherwise classic book.<BR>This is Dracula that has been sanitized, prettied up, and produced for all the World of Darkness and Anne Rice groupies who can't stand the thought that vampirism might be a bad thing.<BR>I don't know of too many people who fall into a middle ground, I guess that middle ground is for people who have no affiliation to vampire fiction.  On that basis, this is quite an enjoyable movie.
0790740443|5.0|I think this movie is one of the most overlooked of recent years. People may laugh, but I thought Kurt Russell was perfect in this--he gets my Oscar for that year. Too bad you never get nominated for a real action flick.<br />He says 80 words (not certain on that, but I counted them once!) but packs more into his performance than any of today's more acclaimed \\"actors\\". I've never seen an actor express so effectively with their eyes. So often I see a close up these days and either am not sure what emotion they are trying to show, or I know exactly what they are trying to display but can't help notice how poorly they are showing it.<br />Maybe part of it comes from the character, I'll admit. His emotions are buried due to his lifelong training, but he's seen some things that have tremendous emotional impact, so you are expecting there's something deep inside that wants to get out. And then Kurt shows it, and very effectively.<br />In summary, this is my favorite of the highly specific Terminator/Robocop/Ultimate Soldier sub-genre, and ends up being one of my very favorite action movies.
B000001G53|4.0|Wagner's final masterpiece demands an orchestra capable of producing gauzy, radiant sonorities, a cast with both beauty of tone and, perhaps even more important, superb acting skills, and a conductor with a talent for both sustaining long musical lines and bringing them together into an overwhelming overall tapestry.  Above all, everyone must capture the mood and feel of this challenging piece.  This last point is the reason why I think studio recordings of this opera, perhaps even of any Wagner opera, are at a disadvantage right from the start.  It's much easier to capture the elusive soul of this work when you're living the story on stage.<br />Karajan's 1980 recording is a case in point.  This performance never achieves lift-off.  It doesn't soar.  Its feet remain firmly planted on the ground.  Which is a pity, considering that the miraculous sound world of Wagner's final opera has probably never been so stunningly captured as it is on this recording.<br />The most impressive aspect of this recording is the absolutely astounding playing of the Berlin Philharmonic.  For instance, the Act 1 Prelude is one of the most stunning examples of Wagner's orchestral wizardry in his entire output, and to be able to hear it in a performance this gorgeous is almost incredible.  The pure radiance of the strings is almost otherworldly, but I think it's the luminous bass line that is the real secret to the incredible texture.  Throughout the work, the BPO achieves revelation after revelation in terms of sheer sound.  <br />Karajan turns in a towering reading of this monumental score.  He was always an expert with huge works, and his command of the structure of the score is exemplary.  He faithfully observes Wagner's numerous dynamic markings, essential to the expression of the score, and throughout the work, his conducting achieves tremendous intensity (notably in the Act 1 Transformation Music and in the Act 3 Prelude).  The only problem is, he's so obsessed with drawing out those incredible sonorities that he misses the soul of Wagner's drama.  The central section of Act 3, where transcendence and spirituality in the conducting are absolutely necessary, is quite earth-bound.  The orchestral playing, while stunning, is not sufficient to carry the performance off the ground.  As with almost all post-1960 Karajan, it all seems too calculated, too pre-meditated, too un-spontaneous.  Comparison with other pre-eminent Wagner conductors proves the point.  In all of his recordings, Knappertsbusch, whose particular qualities made him more suited to this particular work than anyone else, provides the transcendent lift to the music that Karajan so drastically lacks (although it must be said, Kna's orchestras are nowhere near as good as the Berlin Philharmonic).  Even Solti, not normally known for spirituality, was in exceptional form for his 1972 Decca recording, and his performance soars more truthfully and effortlessly than Karajan's.<br />Karajan's cast is strong overall, spearheaded by the weighty bass of Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz.  Moll gives us a warmly, beautifully sung performance, solemn and moving in the great climaxes, but light years behind the incredible achievement of Hans Hotter on the 1962 Knappertsbusch set.  José van Dam is the most beautiful, smooth, musical Amfortas on record, although he doesn't always realize the full dramatic potential of this moving character.  Siegmund Nimsgern is a resonant but sometimes gritty Klingsor, and he never comes close to matching the menacing Hermann Uhde from Kna's 1951 Bayreuth set.  Victor von Halem is a sonorous Titurel.  Dunja Vejzovic is a very acceptable Kundry, secure of both voice and interpretation, but she never matches the magnificent singing of Solti's Ludwig in one of her finest recorded achievements.  The huge weak link in the cast is, unfortunately, Parsifal himself.  Peter Hofmann's dry, gritty, effortful singing and uninspired interpretation are unfortunate in the extreme.  Hearing him immediately after the velvety richness of Jess Thomas or the honeyed beauty of Wolfgang Windgassen is almost laughable.  The choral work is secure and beautiful, but isn't on the level of Solti's Vienna ensemble.<br />Overall, this performance captures the orchestral sound world of \\"Parsifal\\" more impressively and beautifully than any other.  Unfortunately, the performance remains earthbound due to a lack of spontaneity, a preoccupation with the beautiful textures, and a flawed cast.  It is undoubtedly a very impressive recording, but among studio recordings I prefer Solti's Vienna / Decca set, for its more involved cast (highlighted by Ludwig's fabulous Kundry), Solti's admirably sincere and communicative direction, and above all the overwhelming work from the Vienna State Opera ensemble.  First choice overall remains the classic 1962 Knappertsbusch, for the most inspired conducting of the score on record, a flawless cast including Hotter's supreme Gurnemanz, dedicated ensemble work from the Bayreuth forces, and a very special atmosphere which permeates the entire effort, surely one of the three greatest Wagner recordings ever.
0804115613|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes At Whistle Stop Cafe by Fannie Flag is an excellent story about a middle aged woman, named Evelyn Couch, who befriends an elderly Mrs.Ninny Threadgoode. Mrs. Threadgoode tells the tale of her life and the people at Whistle Stop, Alabama. What comes along with the story of Ninny's life is the story of an amazing friendship between two very different people,Ruth and Idgie, who are the owners of the cafe. I really like this book and enjoy reading it. I like how Mrs. Threadgoode's story effects Evelyn's life. It was interesting to see how each character dealed with the many problems that came up in his/her life. The ending is really good and complete. Fried Green Tomatoes at Whistle Stop Cafe is a funny good-hearted story. I recommend it to high school age and above.
B00004LN16|4.0|The lyrics are solid AC/DC.  Nothing's changed for a quarter century.  The attitude's still the same.  Good bluesy sound, with all the positives from their 90's albums.  For some reason, this one has more bite than Razor's Edge or Blow Up Your Video.  AC/DC fans will enjoy this album and know that the World's Greatest Rock 'n Roll Band is still living and rockin'.
B00005ASOC|3.0|Finding Forrester, a film with Sean Connery playing William Forester and Rob Brown playing Jamal Wallace, involved an author writing a book, and then dissapearing from the world.  He stays couped up in his apartment, until one eventful night he has a visiter that helps turn William's and Jamal's life around.  There are also many other people in this story that make Jamal fall in love and William realize that there is a life outside his apartment.  Sean Connery does not want anyone to know his life story or why he did not write another book, but Rob Brown helps him over come his stubbornness.   <BR>This is a great movie for people who love to watch movies with slow beginnings and faster endings.  It is a wonderful movie with romance, basketball, and books.  These two men help each other throughout the film, even though they may not know it till the end.  The story involves characters that seem pretty real, by how they are brought up and how they are stereotyped.  They take over the film by how they make jokes and by how they help each other get over their fears.  Some parts of the movie are kind of different, but all in all the film comes across as young boys at school play pranks and how everything turns out better, if you work at it hard.  Sean Connery and Rob Brown make a relationship that was like father and son, that could last forever.
1577311523|5.0|...<br />I liked the book very much.  It compliments my own religious beliefs.  It is an inexpensive book, well worth the price and time to read and take what works for you out of it.  The immediate benefit for me has been learning to identify the emotion behind my reactions and having my response truly reflect who I am, not necessarily the emotion I am feeling at the time.  I recommend this book to anybody who needs ideas on achieving more peace in life.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This film redeems the bad quality films that have been made over the past few years.  When I first sat down to watch this I was grosely afraid that it would be stupid, only because I am not a Brad Pitt fan, I don't like his style.  But in this film he made a change that was absolutly amazing...and I think that this film should receive more credit.<br />There is a Zen like atmosphere throughout this film, where Edward Norton's Charater remains a emotionally dead individual looking for something beyond his mellow suburban life.  He meets Tyler Durden on an airplane, a man who sells soap for a living to different companies like Macy's and Belk's.  But with his job he is actually happy...and he is also content with letting go of everything just to reamin happy.  Unplugged from reality you might way.<br />By strange chance (I won't tell you) the two of them are brought back together by a simple phone call and talk over three pitchers of beer.  They room together at a house that is so ramshackle it should be condemnded.  But it isn't.  The two of them decide that fighting is a good way to release frustration and let go of material life as it is known.  Fight Club is born.<br />Recruits are brought in, the house becomes a safe place for these guys to enjoy what they like...fighting.  No matter how graphic this movie gets there is always an under lying importance that if you don't pay attention you will miss.  THis is an excellent movie...WATCH IT!!!!  If strong lanaguage offends you and you don't like blood or violence don't watch it...but this movie makes you think!
0451457994|5.0|i loved Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but what this book does, is it makes you look at the history of man in a completly different perspective.  What should literature do?  Inspire, provoke thought and emotion, challenge?  Well you go through some of the most unique emotions as you read this as it is like peering into an unknown thread of your brain and having it tingle where it once was numb.  Recommened for everyone on the planet.
0393312836|4.0|\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is Anthony Burgess's story of the life of a young thug named Alex. The first thing you'll notice about this story is that it is written in a imaginary slang. This slang is called \\"nadsat\\" or teenage talk. The story is divided into three parts. In the first part, it outlines how Alex goes around and terroizes the town until he is caught. The second part tells about his life in prision and the new experimental technique he agrees to take place in. The third section is about how the procedure changes Alex's life and how he responds to this. This is a very good story about good and bad and how far the government may go one day to correct the evil ways of people. I gave this story four stars only because it took about half the book to understand the complex slang. But in terms of plot, development, and language, this story is tops
B00004TKAQ|4.0|I own both the U.S. and the the &quot;restored &amp; remastered&quot; Repertoire version of this classic live recording.  It may boil down to a matter of personal taste, but I found the Repertoire CD to be bass-heavy, and the recording as a whole not to be any clearer than the U.S. CD.  I doubt that the original master tapes were used by &quot;EROC at the Ranch.&quot;  I also doubt that 24 bit digital remastering was used, as was in Capitol's 2002 &quot;CLASSIC MASTERS&quot; QMS compilation.  I will, however, commend Repertoire for its excellent booklet.  It's a shame that neither Capitol nor Rhino has seen fit to put out a definitive remaster this timeless CD.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Oh lordy do I love this movie! Don't be fooled by it's length- the novel isn't very long either. This is one of the best Austen adaptations I have ever seen. I was particularly taken with Ciaran Hinds's performance. Amanda Root was marvelous as well. You could see her character, Anne, change through subtle actions and expressions. <BR>My only concern was that I had to crank the volume a bit to hear everything. If you aren't an avid Austen reader/ fan, then you may not catch onto everything all at once. Other than that, I was incredibly pleased with this movie, and DVD. It's a favorite!

B00003CX5P|3.0|Phantom Menace is a futuristic sci-fi film about stock car racing.  The movie starts out with two English fellas dressed in medieval pajamas.  They run into a character named Jar-Jar Binks who looks like a walking platypus and talks like a sissy Jamaican.  He takes them to an under water city where the people look like frogs and talk like Africans except for the two bad guys who sound like Japanese samuri.<br />Somehow the English fellas and the platypus end up in southern Utah.  That's where the big stock car race is held, except these stock cars are powered by twin jet engines and don't have any wheels.  Most of the drivers are alien critters who look like something even my mean old tomcat wouldn't drag in.  Which is just as well cuz you don't feel bad when they get killed which is pretty often.<br />One of the English fellas wants a little boy to race his car but the boy is busy being a slave to a giant flying bug who talks.  The bug ain't too slick and the English fella gets him to agree to letting the little boy drive.  Once the race begins the little boy doesn't have to do anything but hold onto the handlebars which is real fortunate because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.<br />After the race is over they drag the movie out way too long.  A bunch of stuff happens that don't make no sense, part of it involving some weird chick with a lipstick impairment and a  practical joker for a hair dresser.  One of the English fellas gets killed and they never make it back to Utah.  Reckon that's in the next film.<br />I give this film three stars.  The stock cars crash real good but they should have put the race at the end of the film.
0060922583|5.0|Only one word can describe this book...., WOW.  Nothing in this book is an actual recognised theory, but it makes sense.  It makes so much sense that it's hard to understand why it isn't a full blown theory yet, or that many progressive scientists haven't caught on to it yet.  For instance, the brain works like a hologram.  All memories are stored in the brain at every single point in the brain.  98% of the brain can be removed (any given 98%) and NO MEMORY loss will occur.  Any part of the brain can recall every single memory you've every had...and what works like this?  A hologram.  Every piece of the original object contains the entire stucture of the whole.<br />This book coroborates modern science with ancient knowledge that our 3D universe is just an illusion, that none of this physicalness is real.  And, maybe that's the &quot;danger-zone&quot; that nobody wants to cross into yet.  Because, then, what does this elude to?  It would mean our higher dimensional selves are our true selves and this physical 3D version is just a reflection.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow!<br />Since Hollywood has gone completely creatively bankrupt, it seems that comics are the last bastion of \\"new\\" material for them to use for films.  Too often these films are very poor renditions of their comic counterpart:  Batman and Robin; The Fantastic Four; Spiderman TV series; The Punisher; Captain America; and Tank Girl.<br />There's always room for creative license when transferring mediums, but what is often an overthought is the fan base.  Who goes to see comics to film?  Young adults and kids do.  What do they expect?  Well, they expect something worth their 9 or 10 bucks - that's what.<br />Spiderman delivers a whole lot of film and a whole lot of fun for the money (Okay - so I still think films are waaaaay too expensive, but that's another story).<br />Toby McGuire IS Peter Parker!  Rami cast the part (in fact all the parts) perfectly.  He was right on that it didn't matter who played Spiderman, because whoever it was would be completely disguised.  Peter Parker was the tough character to cast.  Willem DaFoe is excellent as the Green Goblin.<br />How about the story?  It could not have been told more appropriately and succinctly than it is.  Basically, it is the original story from 1962 about how Peter Parker becomes imbued with superhuman powers to later become Spiderman.  Some have argued that Rami and the writers took too much liberty with the character by allowing his web-creation to be internal as opposed to manufactured by Peter.  I beg to differ.  I think that Rami et al made that aspect of the character BETTER than the comic version.<br />Folks, this is a movie.  That said, it's a movie based on a beloved comic and its lead character - and I think that the movie is just about the best comic to film rendition ever done.  Marvel would do well to follow its own example from this film and use the same logic with the next XMen film and any subsequent comics to film made.<br />Go see this film!
B00005K3OT|1.0|Basically, this is your classic chick flick.  Girl finds boy.  Boy and girl fall in love.  Somehow they change a town.  End of story.  If you don't like chick flicks, you will not like this.
B000063TNH|5.0|TRAFFIC is an incredible film. The perfect blend of excellent writing, cinematography, and acting. However, this movie is not for everyone. Don't let the star-studded cast fool you; this is not a traditional Hollywood production. There is no \\"villain\\". The sex scenes are not shown in a sexual manner. The action sequences are devoid of slow-motion dives and explosions. The language is ugly. The settings, even the disgustingly rich La Jolla country club, are gritty. The characters are real. The movie is REAL. If you like to have your movies spelled out for you, then this movie is not for you. If you appreciate fine film-making and directors who respect the audience with honesty, if you like movies that explore beyond the traditional Hollywood bounds, then do yourself a favor and buy this disc. Devour it. This movie is real.
0440219078|4.0|Review<BR>The book \\"The Giver\\" tells about a very different life style of people, living in communities where everything is ruled and where no colours, feelings o climate exist. <BR>I liked the book very much because it was very interesting and surprising to read about this completely different way of life which I could never have imagined in this way before. This story made it clear to me, that people just cant know everything and we dont have the power about everything.<BR>I hesitated at every new rule they wrote about in the book and it was one of those few stories, I really talked about to my friends in my leisure time and even those friends, who didnt read the book seemed to be interested in it. It also was full of suspence, because I always wanted to know if Jonas would reach his aims and if the people in the community will once have a world with feelings too.

B00002E233|5.0|The sharks are smarter than the people! Mind-boggling! Scientists have come up with the cure to Alzheimer's Disease with the sharks' fluids? Genius. Thomas Jane is a shark hunter and LL Cool J is a cook! YES! Samuel L. Jackson makes fun of the midget from \\"Fantasy Island\\" (a moment of uproarious laughter). A pretty English lady who started the whole experiment made inferior decisions by letting the sharks stay alive. The sharks bit off a guy's arm, flooded the research center, made a helicopter crash into a tower and explode which started the fiasco. Superb! It was marvelous when Jackson tried to lead the group of scientists and the shark popped out of the water and ate [him]. Too bad the sharks didn't live happily ever after eating fresh meat from coast-to-coast. Electrocution, explosions and excitement! LL Cool J delivers, Thomas Jane kicks butt and Saffron Burrows was too hot. YES, YES and more YES!
014028009X|4.0|This was one of the funniest books I have ever read!<BR>It is a story of one year in the life of a 30 years old, single London girl. Bridget Jones -much given to irony -is a single who eats, drinks and smokes too much.<BR>She is disorganized, insecure, weight obsessed- a woman trying to cope with her crazy boss and crazier assignments in her job.<BR>The book, which chronicles one year in her life, starts with a series of New Year's resolutions to quit smoking, loose 10 pounds, find a decent boyfriend, and develop ''inner poise.'' Or as she puts it: ''I will not sulk about having no boyfriend and instead develop inner poise and authority and sense of self as woman of substance, complete without boyfriend, as best way to obtain boyfriend.'' <BR>Moreover she starts to write a diary and each diary entry begins with her weight, number of calories eaten, the alcohol units she consumed, cigarettes smoked, and moments spent on having negative thoughts.<BR>Bridget Jones fights with the daily problems of life. Every girl and woman could identify with her very well, because she is a girl like you and me. A real problem for Bridget is her mother. She always wants to find a new boyfriend for her, which makes family celebrations so gruesome for her. Her mother always knows everything better and wants to start a new life with already 60 years. She has a boyfriend which is an additional problem for Bridget and her parents.<BR>Ms. Jones best friend is homosexual and so both of them have nearly the same problem. No man! He helps her to manage daily problems and the other way round.<BR>Bridget slips from one embarrassing situation into the next. There are a lot of funny parts to read in the book. For example the situation as Bridget should report something from a fire department and she is- how else could it be- too late. But this is not the only situation where she shows us how clumsy a human being could be.<BR>Well, it's hard not to laugh with and at Bridget's problems. Any woman who has ever had weight woes or relationship woes will feel Bridget's pain. This book taught me to look at the bright side of life and not take things too seriously. Especially as I read the result of one year diet, she lost 33kg but get 32,5kg back so all in all she lost 0,5kg. No chocolate for the whole year and the favourite jeans doesn't fit anyway.<BR>The same with smoking! She can not give it up!<BR>I personally recommend this book to everyone who likes reading about a woman who is a little bit like everybody of us. I am sure, guys will find it amusing and entertaining as well, especially in getting to know the \\"backstage\\" of a woman's lifestyle and her innermost thoughts and obsessions. It is so unbelievably true to our nature.<BR>There's even a little Bridget Jones in you!
0062502182|1.0|I should have listened to my kindergarten teacher--never judge a book by its cover.  <br />This book has one of the most beautiful covers I've seen.  It has a recommendation by Kenzaburo Oe, a Nobel Laureate, as well as a banner on top identifying itself as an international bestseller.  Moreover, the thinness of the book with its smooth, unobstentatious font suggest that it is a work of serious literature.  It isn't.<br />The story is about a young boy who finds his &quot;treasure&quot; by &quot;realizing [his] destiny.&quot;  Coelho tries (unsuccessfully) to intersperse the text with humor and new age spirituality, but the end result is a corny, poorly written text that insults the reader.  The author quite obviously intended this book as a feel-good type of book to serve as a work of motivation rather than a book of literature.  The publisher should have marketed it as such.  <br />I understand that many people like reading motivational books, and I don't fault them.  I myself like reading motivational books every so often.  However, there are much better books (I would recommend Tony Robbins and Ken Blanchard), and the covers of these books are much more honest in advertising their contents.  Take it from a victim...pass on this book.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that just grows and grows on you. I've listened to this now for however long it's been out and it just gets better and better. Don't listen to narrow minded people who claim to be 'true Radiohead fans' who say this album is not up to scratch. It's a total departure from their original stuff, but deal with it! If these people were fans then they'd move on, just like Radiohead's music has.<br />This album is absolutely awesome, and is a must-have for your collection. Listen to it, and listen again.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I have never written a review and willl never write one again but these armchair critics are driving me crazy. The biggest problem with todays viewers and critics is that they insist on comparisons. Some movies should stand alone. Star Wars Episode One got slammed because people expected even better than the original Trilogy. The same goes for ;Harry Potter:. I have found that the friends that have not read the books enjoyed the movie the most.So..all books aside, I tried to go to 'HP\\" with an open mind and enjoyed myself immensly. It has everything. From great comedy and nailbiting drama to woderful special effects.In general I think people should stop listening to the critics and view the movie the way we used to..stuffed with popcorn and waiting to be amazed..
B00005R87Q|5.0|Mammoth piece of film-making. Tremendous! Vin Diesel (buff guy) and Paul Walker (child cop) star in this massive film production. Walker is an undercover cop who investigates an underground street racing circuit. Diesel is the head of the races and he's enormous. Walker races and loses because 'winning is winning'. He also falls in love with Diesel's sister played by Jordana Brewster, yes! Pure adoration! I worship this movie so much I have a golden copy in a case. I pray to the gods that they will make a sequel to this movie as-soon-as-possible. Michelle Rodriguez kicks so much underside! I loved this movie. The final race is breath-taking and kept me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, jumping from coach to coach. I ate so much potato chips because of the intensity! I gained at least 5 pounds! Buy this movie for your country because of the integrity.
B00005QHSN|4.0|As I'm from the UK I had to not only pay the dollars necessary to buy what is an imported CD (to the US) but also the shipping. This is in itself a statement of my desire to hear this album after such a long gap after Vibrator. I must say it doesn't have the immediate impact I found with Vibrator or in fact the fantastically crafted lyrics but it has a new subtlety that grows on you with furhter listenings. I was initially worried that in having so many tracks the album was somewhat diluted. Thankfully this was unfounded and the album has an abundance of great tracks and I can honestly say that none have you searching for the forward button. His voice is as soulful as ever and the tracks will have you repeating them over and over. Another truly great album from one of the most underrated artists of all time. All I can say is that if you gave up with TTD on album 2 and you love soul music then you've deprived yourself of 3 of the best albums of all time (in my opinion). Buy this album and listen to it over and over - you'll love it.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Cameron Crowe, former teenaged rock critic matured into essayist, screenwriter and film director,  created my favorite film of 2000 (tied with \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\") by bottling a precious ingredient found in few movies- real magic. <br />Drawing from his own rich autobiography, Crowe vividly relates the journey of a teenage Odysseus (played here with wide eyed purity by Patrick Fugit) who embarks on a journey of discovery, pain, love, maturation, loss and spiritual awakening. <br />The magic of Almost Famous lies in its characters' abilities to reach that most heroic of human experience: transformation into a better self.<BR> <BR>Fugit plays William Miller, a fifteen year old genius based upon Crowe himself, who is given the impossible task of writing a \\"think piece\\" in Rolling Stone magazine about a fictitious rock and roll band called Stillwater. Forced to travel the road with the band and their entourage of \\"professional girl friends/fans/groupies\\"- called band-aides here, Miller finds himself caught between staying true to his calling- writing honestly- and betraying new found friends. <br />Crowe's genius, as previously expressed in his earlier films Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Singles lies in his ability to craft through careful collaboration with his always superb casts, real people who despite great character flaws and warts, have the spark of goodness inside them. In a Cameron Crowe film, everyone has the chance to be saved- and in their own way- everyone does end up forgiven and transformed.<br />Unlike many of his cold-hearted, mean spirited and cynical film making peers who actively seek out the sordid, the ugly and the destructive in society, Crowe possesses a sincere love not only for his characters and the world they inhabit but for the audience as well. That love radiates throughout every frame of every film he makes (this does not speak to his misstep \\"Vanilla Sky\\")<br />Crowe also possesses an uncanny instinct to marry music with the film. The sequence fusing Elton John's \\"Tiny Dancer\\" to a Stillwater's collective forgiveness of Russell Hammond is pure bliss. Of course Crowe creates many other similar sequences with music and image.<BR> <BR>This is not to suggest Almost Famous sugarcoats the harsh realities of an early 1970's rock and roll experience. Crowe is too honest a storyteller to allow that.  Free sex, drugs and the related decadence are ever present as are the consequences for such behavior. There is a real general callous soulessness that lurks on the tip of each scene threatening to consume the frail humanity of this Odyssey. But that evil is held at bay and ultimately destroyed by the great good that certainly dwells in every character's heart.<br />As consistent with all previous Crowe films, the acting ensemble is perfect. She has so many scenes that literally broke my heart while making me smile. Billy Crudup as self obsessed guitarist Russell Hammond, although far too good looking for any real rock star, swings gloriously unpredictable between sullen silence, affable congeniality and rage. He is a star in the making. Jason Lee, as lead singer Jeff Bebe, possesses just the right amount of shallow intellectual posings, narcissistic self promotion and paranoid uncertainty that prevails so many in his vocation. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as Miller's hyper-protective Mother. <br />The director's cut DVD is a God Send. The commentary by Crowe and his mother is priceless as is the fleshed out sequences which manage to humanize and elevate the characters even more. Being able to read the complete script is fascinating also as a reference point. It proves the old addage that all good films must begin with a great script.<BR> <BR>Almost Famous is Absolute Magic. Don't miss this one.
6304711905|3.0|Pretty decent movie overall, especially the performances given by Val Kilmer and Michael Beihn. They get 5 stars for their roles as Doc Holiday and Johnny Ringo.<br />There were two big Wyatt Earp films out at the same time. Tombstone and the one with Kevin Costner called \\"Wyat Earp\\", how original. I really wish I could combine the two. Tombstone depicts Earp as a real hero, where as Costner portrayed him for how he really was - a mean SOB. He also married a prostitute, but this version of the film conveniently covers that up. It also justifies Earp leaving his former-prostitute wife for an actress by making the wife a drug addict. Also conveniently leaving out that she became addicted because of Earp.<br />All in all this version is a quick \\"goody-two-shoes\\" version of what happenned at the city of Tombstone. My main beef with this movie, aside from it having very little authenticity, is Earp's mistress. They could have picked a better looking girl to make him leave his wife over. She is ...... well, not pretty. And also leaving Jason \\"9021Ho\\" Priestly and his boyfriend Billy \\"Vain\\" Zane out of this film would have increased this films rating as well.
B000001GXC|5.0|These symphonies find Karajan in a positive mood.  Even thirty years later, they still sound new and give pleasure.  Both works have been lucky on record, so there is little reason to recommend this CD over those by Abbado, Solti, Blomstedt, or Maag.  But it is good Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic play exceptionally well - a safe buy.
0780631684|1.0|Obviously anyone over the age of 18 will not like this movie. Personally, I thought it was funny. Is this entertainment? Only if you are drunk. I give this one star. It's just not worth your time. And I did not see it at the theater or rent the video, I saw it on Starz.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Warning has the catchy melodies of Green Day and it has its own messages, but they feel forced, not something the artists actually felt.  Sure Minority is fun to listen to, and Waiting lets you know a little more about BJ and the gang, but the emotion that is seen in other Green Day albums just isn't there.<br />People compare this CD to Dookie and Kerplunk, but Warning doesn't even compare.  Not only was Dookie loved by thousands, but also the songs from it were performed and loved at WOODSTOCK. Is Warning as good as Nimrod?  Once again, no where close.  By that time, Green Day had &quot;been around&quot; and weree still putting out great music... Yeah, Green Day still has the experience in Warning, but it feels as though someone made the band squeeze out 12 more songs, regardless of how good they were.<br />Green Day finally &quot;grew up&quot; a little, but was it better for the music?  In most cases, I would say it wasn't.  Warning loses the identity of other Green Day albums by hitting the mainstream.  If you want to get a good Green Day CD, buy yourself Dookie.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Never in my life have I heard a CD of this magnitude.  I originally saw the video for &quot;Party Hard&quot; on MTV2, and decided that it was worth checking out.  After purchasing the CD and popping it in my player, the awesome force that is Andrew W.K. hit me like a ton of bricks.  This is one of those CDs you can listen to, start to finish, but also be able to hit repeat disc on your player.  Definetly check it out if you get the chance.
B00000G3PA|1.0|This is a great film for those with the attention span of about 15 seconds. I had high hopes for this film. Alas I couldn't stop myself from making fun of it. Aside from the performances of Steve Buscemi and Bruce Willis, this film was ridiculously bad. Shooting a rifle on an oil rig? Flames on an asteroid (no oxygen for those who don't understand), and machine guns on a moon buggy!? I said machine guns on a moon-buggy!?<br />Once again I sat through a worthless piece of garbage. At one point I hoped Buscemi would lose it and kill them so the film would end. But he didn't, and I was forced to watch Ben \\"No-Talent\\" Affleck and Bruce Willis attempt to save the day.<br />Anybody who says that this movie was good needs to be sent to a medical facility and have their head examined.
6304167660|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again.  I came across it by accident on satellite TV about 3 years ago.  I decided to tape it and ended up watching it as well, then watched it again the next day and again a couple of days later. I was gripped from the beginning.  There are lots of memorable scenes like Rosie O'Donnells' lecture in the convenience store, and Natalie Portmans' discussions with Timothy Hutton about Shakespeare.<br />Just watch it and you'll know what I mean. <br />All the characters were fascinating including Richard Bright who played Willy's (Tim Hutton) father, and David Arquette who played his brother.<br />This is one of 5 films that I have permanently on video. The others being Godfather I,II,III, and Goodfellas.<br />Enough said?
B000059PPN|5.0|The house by the sementary is anather of the best horror movie<BR>the i have seen .you must see this one it gots lots of guts blood .and the story of the film is the best. i recomend zombie,<BR>the black cat, demonia, manahtatan baby. by henry May 23,2002.<BR>dont wath none of this movies  if you get stomaths upsets you while<BR>your eating.#1 you got to see the body parts and head cut of is<BR>the best.
B000002B2T|5.0|The pleasure evoked from music is one of life's greatest and this album represents the end point of another branch of joy.  \\"Wake Up\\" is for many reasons a monumental song and creation, and is by far the best song on the album.  The subtle bassline, chimes, and beats gradually surface the emotional essense of the chilling lyrics - lyrics sung by someone who probably has a first hand knowledge of their meaning - and this quality becomes apparent.  Layne's voice sounds better here than in any other track on any album, the song seems to have been tailored to fit his voice.  One of the most emotionally stirring songs I have been so lucky to have been exposed to.  The remaining tracks are diverse in their strengths, most being high quality tracks, however all are very different.  River of Deceit, X-Ray Mind, Artificial Red, and We're All Alone are sure to please those who find are hard to find it.  I highly recommend this album to any AiC or Layne Staley fan.  Like Morrison, Hendrix, Cobain, and Hoon - Staley made great contributions to music, enriching our world and our lives, but tragically leaving us too soon.  Buy the album and enjoy.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is a story about two travelers that are trying to make their dream come true.  The main charters in this book are, George Milton and Lennie Small.  Both are the run because of an incident that happened in the town Weed. George and Lennie travel to get work so they can one day save up enough money to buy a piece of land and reach their goal.  One thing that Lennie likes to do in this book is to pet soft things.  He likes soft animals especially rabbits.  Lennie is mentally retarded so he doesn't really know what is right and wrong.  Lennie gets himself into lots of trouble throughout this book. <br />My favorite character in this book is George Milton because he gets Lennie out of trouble.  George helps Lennie all the way through their adventure and that is a true friend by your side.<br />I could relate to George because when it comes to a good friend like he is with Lennie I'm there for my friends.  George helps Lennie a lot through this book by sticking up for him and keeping him out of trouble.  I have always saved my friends when they were trouble just like George does with Lennie.  I help my friends when they need it the most.  George helps Lennie when he gets in trouble in the town of Weed.  I am just like George in a way because of how good of a friend he is to Lennie and how I am the same with my friends.   <br />This is a great book, but it is sad near the end.  You can foresee a lot of things while reading this novel.  My favorite part in the book was when Lennie is getting punched in the face by Curly; George then tells Lennie to fight back.  Lennie then grabs Curly's hand with one fist and crushes it.  The part that I least liked in the book was when Carlson shot Candy's dog to put it out of it's misery because Carlson said the dog smelled.  Carlson had no right to shoot Candy's dog even if he did wanted to put it out of it's misery.  I would change the part where Lennie got involved with Curly's wife.  This is when things leads to trouble.<br />I would recommend this book to others because it is a great book.  This book has everything, drama, action and lots more.  I think any type of person would read this novel mostly because of the story, characters and the qualities that it has.  Over all this is the best novel that I have read in years and I suggest others should read this book and enjoy.
B00005JKES|5.0|sigh, i have been awaiting this for ever.  I have the complete season on VHS but now that DVD releases are immenent, im gonna have to half.com it.  this is a fantasic DVD, the extras are fab fab fab.  if you loved this show at all, its a must have.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|From the previews, I thought that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" would be a more traditional movie musical with a classic love triangle between the beautiful woman, the poor artist who truly loves her and the rich man who can give her everything she wants EXCEPT true love--no doubt ending tragically. In fact, the anticipation of a tragic ending kept me from seeing \\"Moulin Rouge\\" when it was in the theaters.  I just wasn't in the mood for that at the time.<br />Boy, did I misread the tone of the movie!  What a shock I had when, shortly into the film, I caught strains of \\"The Sound of Music.\\" Just what were those hills doing \\"alive\\" in fin-de-siecle Paris?, I wondered. That was just the first of many songs from more recent decades that made surprisingly fun appearances in \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" At first, I wondered what was going on, and then I relaxed to enjoy the hilarious ride.<br />In \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" director Baz Luhrmann (of the equally funny \\"Strictly Ballroom\\") sets out to revive the musical.  He does a stellar job of it!  The outlandish sets and glamorous costume are a feast for the eyes.<br />The plot never slows down, and the musical numbers never leave you feeling that the action has stopped for someone to sing.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--yes, reportedly we hear their voices, no Milli Vanilli-esque lip-syncing--sound amazing.  They also show a real flair for physical commedy.  An early scene in which Kidman mistakes McGregor for the wealthy duke, and then has to conceal him when the real duke arrives in her dressing room is reminiscent of similar \\"hide-the-lover\\" scenes in \\"The Marriage of Figaro.\\"<br />My only regret was not seeing it on the big screen. What was I thinking?
B0000668IF|4.0|\\"18\\" is a follow-up to Moby's breakout disk \\"Play\\" .  This is not a bad thing.  If you think you haven't heard \\"Play\\" you are wrong. Moby's music was in every media outlet imaginable in the past year and a half.  With \\"18\\" he continues on his stylistically eclectic path by sticthing together music from bits and pieces gathered from the bins of used LP stores and fringe music downloads.  He runs these found audio objects through his home studio adding his own musicianship and considerable DJing skills to produce occassionally stunning and always interesting, but non-threatening music.  I liked this album a lot, but I wonder about its playability.  Will I still like it after I've heard it a hundred times?  I think so.  Buy \\"Play\\" and buy \\"18\\", they are bookends.  Very nice bookends.  Now the challenge for Moby is to move on to new sonic ground.  Beck reached this point with \\"Midnight Vultures\\" then...nothing.  Lets hope this doesn't happen to Moby.
B00005LC3Y|3.0|Mr. Kubrick did the same thing with &quot;The Shining,&quot; i.e., present it on the DVD with full screen.  Waa this how it was  presnted in movie houses?  Why do we have to sit through his peculiarities?
B00003CX5P|5.0|I dont care what anyone says about this movie (or epi II)I adored it.  I went into it without the expectation that this was going to be Epi V revisited so I loved it. I loved Natalie Portman, I loved Ewan McGreggor.  The movie was just fantastic. This DVD was beyond fantastic, the best DVD since the Matrix
B0000640SA|5.0|Leonard Shelby's life has turned into a quest to find the man who raped and murdered his wife.  But Shelby (Guy Pearce) cannot make new memories.  He relies on post-it notes, tattoos, and Polaroids to help him remember the essentials of what he needs to know about his discoveries.  \\"Memento\\" shows us his search in reverse, taking us further and further into memories that Pearse no longer has.  This storytelling technique works brilliantly, and never becomes confusing.  If you are a fan of Hitchcock or \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" you will absolutely love \\"Memento\\"!
B00004LN16|5.0|This is the bottom line:  AC/DC kicks [butt]!!!  It is amazing that, after twenty- five years in the music industry, AC/DC is still putting out albums that top most, no, all of today's modern rock albums.  This has to be their best since Back in Black.  Boy, Angus and Malcolm really shine on Stiff Upper Lip, especially on \\"come and get it\\".  Other great tracks are the title track, \\"house of jazz\\", \\"safe in new york city\\", \\"cant stop rock n roll\\", \\"satellite blues\\", \\"damned\\", and \\"all screwed up\\".  If you are any type of AC/DC fan, or at that any rock fan, you should definitely own this.
0380973650|5.0|Gaiman pulls off a near perfect mixture of American road-trip, kitch, mythology, and fascinating characterization in this novel. This book is witty with a wry sensability and above all a really likeable character who just happens to be an ex-con on-the-run who really just wants to be left alone. I loved this book and can't wait to read other Gaiman novels.
B000002KAT|5.0|The way young lovers do gets me right {here} every time.  This album, along with Moondance is unreal, it is beyond &quot;classic&quot; it transcends music into unreality.  I love this CD so much it hurts.  Totally one of my desert island discs.
6305165912|5.0|This is the best damn movie ever made. If you watched it once and didn't like it, watch it again. If you still don't like it then you simply don't know a good movie even when you've watched it twice.

Tom Clancy has a very well groomed way of leading a reader into his chapters and keeping them there with every intricate detail. I felt that Rainbow Six was the best book that I have ever read. Special ops and military work are very intriguing to me and this book includes every aspect of special ops teams down to the firing of rounds from a gun, to the computer satellite systems used as surveillance techniques by the ops teams. Military has always been a passion of my family. I have been able to be brought up in a family with two officers of the U.S. military. One NAVY and one Army. One also being an officer of the law. I have learned a lot about war and the military system. This book made me appreciate my knowledge of the military even more. The book was a very good read and I enjoyed the book very much. I have read a few of Clancy's books and plan to read as many as possible. So far the best of the Clancy books I have read is Rainbow Six. I have also read The Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, and The Sum Of All Fears. I felt the climatic events throughout the book were exactly what they needed to be to lead the reader through every chapter. Rainbow was such an attacking group that I expected them to stop at nothing to get the job done. I felt that the ending was a bit too forgiving. Throughout the whole book, even up to the ending, the whole idea was to kill and finish anyone in the path of Rainbow who was not rightfully in that path. The ending of letting nature take care of itself just seemed too forgiving. I know the idea behind the idea was supposed to be poetic justice, but for the attack the Horizon group was planning against the world a more horrifying death should have been what the Horizon group should have faced. As I said I felt the book was the best that I have ever read but I felt the ending could have been handled in a different fashion. Thanks go out to Tom Clancy for continuing to write his perfect, intriguing writings.
0375703861|3.0|In White Teeth, Zadie Smith assembles quite a cast: The bumbling middle-class Englishman, the Jamaican Jehovah's Witness, the Pakistani family divided between traditional parents and rebelious children, and a Nazi-esque white family masquerading as do-gooders. <br />The first 1/4 of the book is so full of cliches and been-done Brit Chick Lit banter that I almost put the book down (there should be a law against referring to \\"pass-go-collect-$200\\" by now!)...thankfully, when the second section starts the cliches disappear and the story starts to get (somewhat) interesting. Without giving away details, I can say that readers will find some very original writing mixed with a lot of \\"let's all get along\\" preaching and mild paranoia about \\"what white people are really thinking when brown-skinned people aren't around\\" along with one or two Biblical misquotes. <br />Unfortunately the obviously talented Ms. Smith leaves the cast where they are at the beginning, dragging the story along without allowing either the plot or the characters develop into a worthwhile read.

B00003CX5P|5.0|In 1999 a film was released called Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. It was the most anticipated film, well ever. Soon after it's release, many were complaining about how inferior this film was to the Star Wars legacy. I think just the opposite. While Phantom Menace isn't was good as the original trilogy, or Attack Of the Clones, The Phantom Menace is still a worthy inclusion in the Star Wars saga. My only major complaint is that annoying character Jar Jar Binks. But I got around him rather quickly. Other than that, this is an exciting chapter in the Star Wars saga. <br />The trade federation is setting up a trade boycott of the planet Naboo. Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) sends two Jedi knights named Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate with the federation. But Lord Sideous has other plans. An invasion of Naboo. Qui Gon and Obi Wan escape with Amidala from Naboo, and are heading for Coruscant. But the ship breaks down, and they are stranded on the planet Tatooine. There, they meet Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) a young boy with extraordinary talents. Qui Gon decides to take him to Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi. Meanwhile, Sideous sends his apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park) to capture the queen so she can sign a treaty making their invasion legal. On Coruscant, Amidala decides she wants to form an army with Jar Jar's natives to take back her planet, and save her people. <br />Overall Grade: A (10+++)

B00004W5UA|5.0|I don't know whether it was the great directing or the psycologically twisted tale that made this such a cool movie. One way or another, this is a bloody-good show. The main character, Tyler Durden (Ed Norton/Brad Pitt) is a deeply disturbed individual suffering from; insomnia, ego states, and schizophrenia. The plot/story line shifts several times throughout this movie, keeping it interesting. There are a lot of cool lines and funny situations (eg. the liposuction clinic). The book was good, the movie was better. I had to watch the movie 'Panic Room' the other day, since it was also directed by David Fincher. Panic Room was okay--Fight Club was phenomenol. ... I'm going to have to find out what other movies Fincher has directed. All of Chuck Palahniuks books are like this--but different. It would be great if more of them were made into movies. This movie is filled with adult situations and not meant for children. This is also one of those movies you can't get out of your head. One of my favorite movies, I've seen it a hundred times.  WATCH IT!

This one's going to the bottom of my stack real fast.&quot;  Then a strange thing happened.  I couldn't stop listening to it.<br />It's not that Ms. Jones is a bad singer.  Far from it; she has a real bluesy sound that reminds me of Natalie Merchant's first album, Tigerlily.  And it's not that she sings songs that are overdone.  She has a really good selection to choose from:  old country, old jazz, and some new stuff she made.<br />This is just one of those CDs you find yourself putting into the CD player more and more (especially given the dearth of good music on the mainstream radio stations) as you go along.<br />In short, it's just a very good album.
6304708491|5.0|&quot;Help!&quot; was the greatest film ever made. It has enough action, comedy, music, and spoofing to keep people interested. I find myself quoting this movie everyday, just like I do with &quot;Hard Days Night&quot;. Whenever its cold outside, I always say &quot;It's cold, its a cold place&quot;. Just like Bhuta says. I think the beach scenes the best when they're singing &quot;Another Girl&quot;. I know this movie by heart and glad I do. Everyone should watch this movie at least 10 times. John is such a cutie in this movie!
B00004Z459|5.0|I have had this CD for about two months after its realese and I absolutely love it. I can listen to this CD over and over again for hours on end. Chester's voice helped by Mike's awesome rapping are the best thing to happen to the music scene since I don't even know what. Nothing can compare to these six guys talents, or their skill in portraying their message without having to use the &quot;F&quot; word every other time. Linkin Park Rules!
B00005LMBK|5.0|last song is the best song, bay far, the new gum commercial can attest to that.  I think this is a neat disc.  Its totally listenable, the videos are great and the extras are fantastic.
B000063UR2|5.0|LEGEND never really found an audience in theatres despite Ridley Scott and Universal's constant tinkering with the final cut.  Seems many movies of this era were victims of audience test screenings, and the desire to give people a commercial product that went down easy -- see BRAZIL for a prime example of how studios think (the &quot;love conquers all&quot; version).  So LEGEND was severely edited and rescored with a hasty (but often effective score by TANGERINE DREAM).  It was short on plot and long on art direction, but sumptuous visuals and an all-out acting job by Tim Curry and make-up artist Rick Bottin made the movie an easy favorite of many fantasy fans.  The movie looks stunning, and the story is a universal plunge into archetypes.  Nothing wrong with that, it certainly worked for STAR WARS!<br />This DVD collection gives you two versions of LEGEND -- the original director's cut with over twenty minutes of added footage and the original Goldsmith score; and in addition, you get the original US release.  In essence you get two different movies!  The moods vary, the characters seem a little different, with whole new speeches and images to enjoy.  If you are a fan of the movie or Ridley Scott it's a MUST-HAVE!  This is what DVD dreams are made of.  While many bemoan the fact BLADE RUNNER does not come with its 2 versions -- the fact is other than the narration and the happy ending, there is not MUCH different.  But here we have a case where you can see what happens to a movie as it goes through development HELL.  Fascinating stuff, and it comes LOADED with extras.<br />The only downside is the director's cut gets the royal treatment of a 5.1 sound mix while the other version gets a 2 channel Dolby mix, and even the video quality seems different with again the director's cut looking better than the theatrical release. But at last we can see a widescreen version of either cut, and we get a lot of extras that explain some of why the movie is the way it ended up.  Beautiful images, two good soundtracks (I like both though the mood changes), and basically strong performances.  LEGEND is a waking dream!p.  Beautiful images, two good soundtracks (I like both though the mood changes), and basically strong performances.  LEGEND is a waking dream!
6304708521|5.0|This film has to be one of the most underrated films. First of all, a lot of people said there's no point or plot to this movie, but who cares.... ITS THE BEATLES!!! I think its a cool time piece. This came from the same psychedlic minds of John, Paul, George, and Ringo that brought you \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". It has beautiful scenery and color. And the scene where John is shoveling the spaghetti onto Ringo's Aunt's plate is just awesome. It was an actual dream that John had and it came true. Who wouldn't like to go on a Magical Mystery Tour with the Beatles???
B00005JL0U|5.0|Hey, this is to all Jackson fans, GET THIS TAPE!! I loved this tape ever since I saw it, it was made in 1988 and that was the year I was born! So I've been rockin' to MJ my whole life. I remember always askin' my sister where the Moonwalker VHS was, because it was magical, colorful, it has beautiful songs, everything that a little kid would like. Michael's dancing is amazing and the songs too! I will always love MJ, and the reason why I started was because of this tape, so get it!!
B00005QZWI|4.0|THIS SNDTK TOTALLY WENT WITH THE MOVIE, ITS A GREAT LISTEN IN YOUR CAR OR AT WORK OR HOME TO RELAX AND RELIVE THIS EXCELLENT FILM.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|brilliant! an absolute masterpiece!, baz has outdone himself this time, if youve seen romeo and juliet and strictly ballroom, then you'll know what i am talking about, moulin rouge has brilliant costume design, angus strathie and catherine martin really deserved their oscars, this movie should have won the oscar for best film, there will never be anything this breathtaking or the WOW! factor, never in a lifetime have i been so taken aback by the story, the music is so clever, and come what may always makes me cry, nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor were the cutest couple, who agrees with me that if they really did get together, they would have the most good looking kids of all time? i am nicole's biggest fan, and she should have won the oscar, i feel sorry for poor ewan, not even an oscar mention! poor baz! not an oscar mention either? hello? anyhoo, ill finish by saying it is the perfect movie, and anyone who doesn't think it is a masterpiece, obviously doesn't know much about films.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was shocked by how good this movie is. When I first heard about it last summer, I thought it would be a cheap PG kids movie that only costed [$] to make. I was so wrong. Turns out they actully paid [$] to make this movie, and it is PG-13. Not just for kids. The special effects are great. I could watch Spider-Man web-sling all day. It looks so real, the movements of his body and the way his muscles move. I mean, it probably IS REAL!! Which is what I would've believed if it weren't for Green Goblin. Don't get me wrong; he's one of the best supervillians I've ever seen. But, his costume looks PLASTIC! But, still, he looks really good when he's flying with his glider. Another thing I was suprised at was the action-sequences between Goblin and Spidey. I thought Spidey would just web Goblin up and punch 'em a few times and take 'em to jail. But no. Think Mortal Kombat meets Rocky...dramatic. And Kirstin Dunst did a really good job playing Mary Jane, too.
B00003CXI0|4.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" may be best summed up as a hearty, destiny-driven quest. The costume design, art direction, and score by the invincible John Williams are among the best of the year, but it is the film's strict adherence to J.K. Rowling's engrossing tale that makes it worthy of its record setting box office numbers. A far more centralized and child friendly flick than \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\", Harry Potter fans could not ask for anything more than what fluidly caresses the movie screen. I don't imagine that the movie is any less fun on the small screen, either. The only measurable flaw with \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" is Chris Columbus' failure to bust out the magic of child actor directing he showed in deserving family films like the \\"Home Alone\\" series. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who play the popular triumvirate of Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, often seem delayed in their reactions and pretty stiff in their dialogue. Radcliffe redeems himself when it counts, though, in a cliffhanging ending that pits him against his worst enemy and unescapable destiny. Alan Rickman's strong but underused performance as nasty Severus Snape made us hate his role all the more. My verdict: A film worthy of family time and enjoyment that children and, yes, even teens like myself deserve to see when they go to the movie theater. David's Favorites: Best actor or actress: Alan Rickman<BR>           Best scene: Quidditch game. <BR>           Comparable to: \\"The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\"
B00005R2M3|5.0|Don't know about you but I like the spanish version of her big hit, whereever, whenever better-this CD is a must buy for \\"Siempre\\" and \\"Objection-Tango\\", \\"Poem to a Horse\\" is a cool song as well.  Shakira is HOT, her videos (especially those on MTV-S) are the bomb!
B00004XOWM|1.0|If it's metal you're looking for, check out Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Panteral, Iced Earth, Inflames, or Nevermore.<br />But I'll review the album anyways.<br />Guitar - Subpar, easy ..., no complexity; musically lacking here.<br />Drums - Dry, uncomplex, no originality.<br />Bass - All it does is use the root note and follow the guitar.<br />Vocals - Fred sounds like he has something stuck ...<br />Lyrics - [juvenille].<br />'Nuff said. If it's a metal album you want, go buy Metallica's Master of Puppets.
B0000060NF|5.0|What's real genius about this album is how he takes politically oriented songs and makes them so tuneful.  Most songs that touch on political issues sound like textbooks, but Marvin soars like a bird through this album.  The amazing (and sad) part is that this album is still so relevant (except for the long hair line in the title track).  Also the Hughes Brothers video for \\"Inner City Blues\\" is fantastic.  Soul never got better than this!
B00005UEAR|4.0|Very, very, very, very, VERY good album. I'd review each track, but there's too much to review. I gave it a four because there are some songs I didn't care for (1 or 2, it won't get a perfect score for that) but the rest shine above that. Just buy it. Now.
B000002JSN|5.0|As far as double albums go, it's right up there with \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"London Calling.\\"  What it sounds like is a 2 disc Zep's greatest hits, since it's chock full of such great stuff.  Some of the greatest riffs and drum grooves ever are here.  \\"The Rover,\\" \\"Trampled Underfoot,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"The Wanton Song\\" where does one start.  And of course, my two favorites are \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"In the Light.\\"  \\"Custard Pie\\" certainly grooves like a mother, but it's \\"In the Light\\" that is truly transcendent.  Page's ascending guitar line during the chorus lifts this song into the stratosphere.  One of the greatest Zep songs I almost never hear on the radio!
B000063UR1|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie, I have nightmares.  The senerio is so eerily close to where we are today.  I cry everytime Bruce does what he needs to do.<br />The first time I saw the film was on TV.  It stuck with me for weeks.  Now, everytime I see it, I get angry, scared, sad, and depressed.  Powerful stuff, considering that I now know how it ends.<br />Bravo for Bruce Dern, what a performance.<br />PS:  As far as a propaganda film goes, I think that depends on your point of view.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Though it was his second studio album, it contains so many classics that it could be called a greatest hits album.  &quot;Radio Radio,&quot; &quot;This Year's Girl,&quot; &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea&quot; were some of the top songs of the new wave.  They sound just as full of spit and vitriol today as they did almost a quarter century ago.  It was amazing to hear Elvis finally do &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on SNL, backed up by the Beastie Boys!  If you're wondering when Elvis was actually &quot;cruel,&quot; listen to this masterpiece!
B000002LEM|3.0|\\"OU812\\" was Van Halen's second effort with Sammy Hagar, and coming on the heels of the exceptional \\"5150\\" (one of the best albums ever made), it was inevitable that this would be a disappointment.  Not that it's a bad album by any means, but it suffers from an overall blandness.  Keyboards creep even further into the mix to the point where you really wish they'd just go away, and when the band does choose to flat-out rock, it kind of has a been-there-done-that feel to it.<br />\\"Mine All Mine\\" is a fast synth-driven tune (i.e., very little guitar) with a heavy message about a guy who's got all the material possessions he could want, but still isn't satisfied because he seeks something a little more spiritual.  It'd be pretty heady stuff if it wasn't on the same album as such dumbed-down crotch rockers like \\"Black and Blue\\" (probably the weakest lead-off single from a VH album ever) and \\"Sucker In A Three Piece\\".  Sammy Hagar can sing circles around David Lee Roth, but as a lyric writer he's pretty weak.<br />\\"When It's Love\\" is of two token power ballads here, but compared to the excellent \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Love Walks In\\" from the previous album, it's pretty generic.  Why this one became a big hit and those two didn't is beyond me.  \\"Feels So Good\\" is actually the better of the two ballads.  The keyboards really enhance that one.<br />The twangy \\"Finish What You Started\\" was another big hit, and give them credit for doing something outside of the box, but it winds up sounding like little more than a John Mellencamp tune.  The best songs on the disc are the ones that stick pretty close to the tried-and-true Van Halen drums-bass-and-guitaerobics  - \\"A.F.U (Naturally Wired)\\", \\"Cabo Wabo\\", and \\"Source of Infection\\".  The CD-only bonus track \\"A Apolitical Blues\\" is something that should've stayed in the vault.  Van Halen taking a stab at the blues (by way of a Little Feat remake) just don't work.<br />Overall, this is a spotty effort, nowhere near as good as \\"5150\\", which was also all over the map but seemed to pull it off a lot better.<br />The worst thing about this CD, however, is the fact that the tracks are listed on the back cover in alphabetical order, and not in actual running order.  Drives you nuts, I don't know how many times over the years I've flipped that thing over to see which song was coming up next only to get burned.  The running order is listed inside the booklet, but c'mon, who really wants to pull that thing out every time they play the disc?hich was also all over the map but seemed to pull it off a lot better.<br />The worst thing about this CD, however, is the fact that the tracks are listed on the back cover in alphabetical order, and not in actual running order.

B000002JS6|5.0|This album has what they like to call in the musis biz, \\"LEGS!\\"  22 years later and 24 million copies sold (how's that for consistency?), this album still rises above all others in the hard rock genre.  The title song is being used to promote \\"Men in Black 2\\" and its riff was also used in that Gap ad with that guitar playing lady.  Every other song is a stone gold groove, from \\"Hells Bells\\" right through to \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.\\"  If someone came here from Mars wanting to know what rock and roll is, give them this album and watch the smiles on their alien faces!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|And the DVD that set the Standard for many of the releases you see Today. This disc basically invented the unique DVD  box cover art and packaging you see in most dvd releases. One of the first Two disc sets to really wow DvD owners. This is the prize DVD in my collection with quite possibly the BEST DVD Actor commentary I've heard to date. I find Director commentaries to be too technical and boring. Actors should do  more of them. It's a complete joy hearing Ed Norton and Brad Pitt relive the film and show how much fun they had and how they really loved how the film turned out. The behind the scenes are all realy interesting, the only thing is their are no Featurettes, but thats no big deal. Fox has continued to show this much love to all their dvd releases, and they certainly stand out as one of the Top DVD makers to date. <br />Now a brief film review. <br />The Film is a cult classic, it's violence and values grab america by the throat and demands attention. Taking the Book and making more sense out of it. This is one of my top  fav films ever. Ed Norton is long over do for an oscar.
B000002NBY|5.0|Having insanely eclectic musical taste, I am invariably disappointed when great, eclectic music doesn't become a hit.  How amazing it was at the age of 16 when this masterpiece was released to see it become such a hit.  An album this diverse with people from all walks of life singing along to its tunes - how grand was that?!  With some of the greatest music (and lyrics) that Paul Simon ever produced, this success made up for all those other acts who never got recognized for the groundbreaking things they do.  Even today, listening to this brings nothing but a huge smile to my face!!!
B00003CXI0|5.0|OK All - I keep reading reviews written (obviously) by adults.  I would like to remind you - THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON A CHILDREN'S NOVEL!!!!!!  So stop with the over analyzed reviews.  NOT only are the books exceptional, but the movie is VERY entertaining.  AND, my son LOVES this film!  So, even if I hated the movie with a passion (which I do NOT), I would still rate this highly (since the audience it has been aimed at would give it a high rating).  We have looked forward to the video release since first hearing the book would be made into a film.  FUTHERMORE, I look forward to the next novel and the next movie and so forth and so on!
B000002KHF|5.0|Though it's an upbeat album lyrically and musically, some of the music is so beautiful, it'll make you cry!  Specifically, I'm talking about \\"Into the Mystic,\\" one of the most moving songs ever recorded in any genre.  When Van wails, \\"I wanna rock your gypsy soul\\" in the second chorus, I can't help but cry, regardless of what I'm doing.  That one wail sums up all the emotional longing expressed for hundreds of years!!!  Only Van Morrison could summon those ancient Celtic ghosts.  The amazing thing is, Van has many more songs in his catalog that'll chill you to the bone.  Like Sinead O'Connor once said, Van the Man should be canonized!!!
B00005V9HA|5.0|We all remember the first day we got our DVD player and were able to jump right in and start building our DVD collection. Oh, what a glorious day that was. I just remember being on cloud nine as I thought of all the movies I wanted to add to my collection. This movie was one of the first ones that I wanted to add to my collection. So, after finding out that it was out of print, all I could do was wait till the day they would release this horror classic again. Well, the wait has definetly been worth it! This DVD package is top notch. They just don't make movies like this anymore. If you grew up in the 80's like myself, horror movies were everywhere. Some horrible, some good, and once in a while a classic like this. A great story, cheesy but good acting, lots of nudity for no reason (ya gotta love that), massive amounts of gore, and zombies make up for a movie that is guaranteed to please. The film transfer and widescreen presentation couldn't be better. It's also a good disc to test out your sound system. Sounds great. The extras include a commentary by director Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna, Jeffrey Combs, Robert Sampson, Barbara Crampton, and Bruce Abbott. It's great to hear so many peope involved with this share great insight and fond memories of making this movie. Included on disc 2 are interviews with Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, writer Dennis Paoli, composer Richard Band, and Fangoria editor Tony Timpone which is actually very good. 16 extended scenes, 1 deleted scene, 5 t.v. spots, 1 trailer, and numerous other goodies that are worth checking out. It took me all night to check out everything on this 2 disc set. When it says that are over 6 hours of bonus materials in this collection, they aren't kiddin'. Overall a great buy. I would easily pay [$] for this set. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy movie fans.
B000002KAT|5.0|Van's ventures in the slipstream demand nothing less than your full attention.  It's like a great jazz album; it's not meant to be background music.  Listening to this album on a summer evening as the sun's going down, windows open, breeze coming in, is a religious experience.  As long as those breezes still blow, this album will continue to work its magic on generations of people, moving them to the cores of their souls.  God bless Van the Man and his amazing muse!!!
6304806418|5.0|Madonna and Antonio Banderas were the best I have ever seen them.  She does such an awesome job portraying the graceful Eva Pern, Banderas provides a hansome voice and has presence flowing from him. Perfect choral work. Beautiful.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Like many reviewers, the excellence of \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" cannot be disputed.  However, it's the excellence of the other tracks that make this a classic.  These tracks represent some of what made Zep so excellent, these tracks that never make it on the radio.  Bonzo has never shown brighter than on songs like \\"For Your Life,\\" \\"Hots on for Nowhere\\" and \\"Royal Orleans.\\"  Though Zep were a bunch of white, British musicians, the grooves they laid down here were some of the best ever recorded.  The fact that they were rushing to finish this album shows that in times of stress, great things can be achieved.
B000002OHX|5.0|I've had the good fortune to have seen Wishbone Ash in this configuration of musicians several times from arenas to a high school. Every performance was a bit different but uniformly excellent. Wishbone Ash comes from an era where it was expected that musicians have chops. The band one upped their 70's contemporaries by playing several styles of music from blues based boogie to progressive to folk. Often some jazz was thrown in for good measure.<br />This could spell a mess but Wishbone Ash was well grounded and had great style when playing and especially when guitarists Andy Powell and Ted Turner soloed.<br />Live Dates captures the sound and vibe of Wishbone Ash live. The stylistic diversity is quite clear from their take on boogie numbers including Jail Bait, Lady Whiskey and the cover of Baby What You Want Me To Do. These tracks are surrounded by the pop of Blowin' Free, the progressive rock of The Pilgrim, Phoenix, and Warrior along with the quieter English folk of Ballad Of The Beacon.<br />Wishbone Ash turned conventions upside down with Martin Turner's bass often carrying the melody of a song as guitars harmonized and set the rhythmic tone along with drummer Steve Upton.<br />Rather than perform carbon copies of album tracks Wishbone Ash frequently improvises or at the least revises solos and in some cases arrangements.<br />Besides being a great live album it is also a good place to start with Wishbone Ash. Soon after this part of the band's career guitarist Ted Turner left the band and the diversity of styles would become less pronounced.<br />If you want to get an idea of smart rock in the 70's this is a good place to start.
B000002ADT|5.0|The most amazing thing about this album is its staying power.  Many other reviewers have already covered the brilliance of the music, but it's even more astounding how much press this album still gets.  How many other albums had not one but TWO books written about their genesis last year (for the record, Ashley Kahn's book is the better of the two)?  This album, 43 years after its release, continues to sell between 10,000 and 20,000 copies every week!!  When you go into a Wal-Mart or other retail store, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is usually the ONLY traditional jazz album they have.  It's one of those albums that you want others to hear, even those who know nothing about jazz.  I'm sure sales of this go much higher during Christmas, as people want to buy it for others to show them the light.  If Miles is the Shakespeare of jazz (master of many different styles), then \\"Kind of Blue\\" is his \\"Hamlet\\" - something that you can't escape!!!
B00004T1NA|5.0|It takes courage and conviction for an artist to try new ideas at the risk of losing their initial audience. Such is the case with Porcupine Tree. Starting as a spacey electronic music project and advancing to a band capable of ambient dreamscapes and intense rock, often with a progressive feel Lightbulb Sun has alienated some fans while gaining new ones.<br />There is a bit of all phases of Porcupine Tree's musical evolution on this CD. The prevailing mixture of sardonic and sad lyrical themes are both personal and mildly abrasive. This makes for an interesting listen.<br />Songs like Lightbulb Sun and Feel So Low put a  electronic/progressive spin on the pop/rock sensibilties they are based in. Four Chords That Made A Million is a great parody on multiple levels, sounding almost close enough to be the kind of cookie cutter &quot;product&quot; that the song sneers at. In a similar vein Last Chance To Evacuate Earth... continues a long line of instrumental tracks borrowning from the electronic music side of Porcupine Tree, in this case using the eerie samples from the goodbye tape from the Heaven's Gate cult.<br />The longer form songs Hatesong and Russia On Ice are variations on a theme so to speak based all the way back to The Sky Moves Sideways. These songs are more structured but still give the feel of earler, loosely constructed music.<br />Lightbulb Sun is an excellent album that shows maturity, diversity and progression in a band that sometimes prefers not being considered progressive. It is sad that some listeners get fixated on conventions of certain music genres or specific areas from previous artist's albums expecting them to infinately repeat the past while complaining that more conventional music is horrible because it's the same recycled garbage. These same listeners equate accessability with bad music.<br />Any Porcupine Tree album has great moments, you really can't go wrong from The Sky Moves Sideways onward to Lightbulb Sun. Even though they soundvery different there is an essence of Porcupine Tree on every album no matter how loosely played or tightly constructed. It should also be noted that every album Porcupine Tree has released has presented major changes and leaps in sonic and songwriting quality. <br />Part with your cash, this album is worth it.

B000065U1N|5.0|Before watching this movie, please read a review One of the best war movies ever made! dated 5, 2002, by a viewer from Sacramento, California. Unfortunately for me I read it too late. I fainted exactly during the episode when a medic was trying to save his severely wounded buddy. Thus I never saw the rest of the movie and know the end of this story of outstanding heroism of the soldiers and exceptional stupidity of the high commanders because I have read Mark Bowden's book. Still I give the movie 5 stars: 1) what I saw was very convincing and impressive; 2) all my friends gave it 5 stars.

Working with his own impressions of the firebombing of Dresden which he witnessed as a POW, he wrote an impressive anti-war-book.<br />Like Joseph Heller, who deals with roughly the same topic (war) in his book \\"Catch 22\\", another very impressive anti-war-book, Vonnegut´s \\"Slaughterhouse five\\" is for me a little, but very strong cry for humanity and peace, more than ever important in a time where war-mongers seem to dominate!<br />Vonnegut´s protagonist Billy Pilgrim, unable and unwilling to struggle with the woes of war, witnesses the total destruction of Dresden by a firestorm, created by an allied air raid, experiences time-travel and contact with exterrestrian life forms.<br /> In plain and simple words and phrases the writer tells the story of an innocent hero, a hero who never fired a shot, who never tried to do all the hero-business like killing and destroying, who barely tried to survive.
B000050FEN|4.0|the commentary with david fincher, brad pitt, and morgan freeman is probably the most rambling commentary i've ever heard on a DVD.  it's a little tragic the way fincher fawns all over pitt like a high skool new media dork with a secret crush on the quarterback.  pitt himself uses big words and concepts a little incoherently - but i'm sure he looks great while he does it.  freeman just seems to think it's \\"inside the actor's studio with morgan freeman,\\" because he constantly goes off on these half-hour lectures over the fine points of screen-versus-stage acting or whatever, usually in the middle of my favorite scenes when i really wish they would talk about what's actually going on.  <br />still, it's a nice movie, very stylish, very consciously film noir in the classic detective sense, though it thoroughly explored the boundaries of the R-rating in 1995.  fincher knows what he's doing in creating an atmosphere of decayed, malevolent beauty, as anybody who's seen any of his films or videos knows.  it's very gothic and not believable at all if you take any time to think about it - the murder scenes are especially over-the-top, \\"cute,\\" contrived and storyboarded, even considering that john doe is a 90's kind of lunatic with a strong sense of irony.  but for what it's worth, i like that theatricality.  give me the ludicrous and beautifully revolting eye-candy of se7en anyday over the \\"hyperreal\\" shaky grainy camcorder of...well, you know.<br />as for the actors, morgan freeman is typically understated and believable, but his character is really just the straight man to brad pitt's overblown drama-queen tough-guy, whose histrionics suggest an attempt to channel brando.  gwyneth paltrow is as good as anybody in the rather one-dimensional role of \\"the wife.\\" she doesn't do anything in the movie really except hang out in the apartment; her character is critical to the plot simply by virtue of who she is to pitt.  of course, kevin spacey pulls off the role of john doe the serial killer with both hands cuffed behind his back.  he's pretty much what you were expecting: shaved head; manifest \\"schizophrenic\\" behavior patterns; creepy, deliberate diction; and that strange combination of prissy righteousness and pathological malevolence that has been movie shorthand for \\"homicidal nut\\" at least since silence of the lambs.  <br />everything is a little bit \\"too much\\" in this film; the moral is, that's entertainment.  but the \\"surprise\\" ending actually is the most logical way to go with this storyline.  fincher just had the balls to go there and stay there and not condescend to the audience's supposed sentimentaility.  i haven't watched the alternate ending(s) but if they mess with the basic theme in any way, i'm sure they're horrible.  if you're going to make this kind of movie, i.e. the grim commentary on the sickness of modern society from the point-of-view of one of its sickest, you don't weasel your way out of it at the end just to pander to a demo.  <br />one last interesting point is that this film is not yet a decade old, yet it's already been pirated conceptually on so many levels that it really does lack the power today that it had when it came out.  the obvious case-in-point is the title sequence, which was groundbreaking in its day, as hard as that is to believe.  now (as brad pitt observes) you've seen the same technique in every trifling car ad on TV, every music video, every sitcom intro, etc.  all successful films are copycatted, but they really went nuts with se7en.  still, there's enough substance under the style to redeem a watch - even though it may already seem slightly old skool!
6305949980|5.0|It's \\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" of course.  It was the movie that made the record of the first stop motion animated film.  The story is of a character who has never heard of Christmas before and somehow \\"discovers\\" it. I think it is always worth view, unless your one of those... individuals who doesn't appreciate Tim Burton's \\"dark humor.\\"  The story is of Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, but lately, he's pretty much grown tired of the same old tricks and treats, deep in lamentation. (Hence the name of the song, \\"Jack's Lament.\\")  One night, while he's wandering around in a forest, head filled with his thoughts of misery and woe, he finds a clearing where every tree is decorated with some holiday symbol.  They all seem to interest him, but what fascinates Jack the most is none other than the Christmas tree.  Danny Elfman, who provides Jack's gorgeous singing voice, is a master with \\"Nightmare's\\" music and songs.  Who wouldn't mind going out on Halloween night, singing \\"This is Halloween\\" at the top of their lungs?  (That's what my friends and I did last Halloween.)  Anyway, you have ten songs to choose from.  The cast of characters is awesome too.  Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is sweet and sensitive and is always willing to help Jack, even it means literally risking an arm and a leg.  Lock, Shock, and Barrel (Paul Rubeuns, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman) help make up \\"Nightmare's\\" interesting plot.  Without this terrible threesome, Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) would have no place in the story.  Now, every movie needs a villain, and who would be better than the notorious Oogie Boogie (Ken Page)?  Overall, I think this movie deserves all five stars.  One for animation, one for music, one for charcters, one for the story, and one for everone who pitched in and worked on this movie for three years.
0452282152|3.0|Girl With a Pearl Idea, Poor Execution<BR> Girl With a Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier, provides an interesting, though far from \\"seamless\\" (as it is billed) mesh of history and fiction.  The novel traces the story of Griet, daughter of a blinded tilesman, who is forced to work, as a result of the blinding, as a maid in the unlikely house of Johannes Vermeer.  Griet, who is assumed at the outset to be the girl in the painting, eventually turns every woman in the household against her as she becomes closer to Vermeer.  After being painted, at the bidding of rich Van Ruijven, she is summarily kicked out of the house and marries butcher \\"Pieter the son,\\" who had been courting her.<BR> The story, though obviously fictional, is meant to create a life for the woman in the anonymous portrait, believed by some to be Vermeer's daughter, though his oldest daughter would have been only eleven at the time of the painting in 1666;  clearly too young to be the girl in the picture.  So, we must first assume that this woman is not a direct relation of Vermeer, and second, we must assume that she exists, and is not a creation of Vermeer's mind.  With these contentions accepted, and with the concession that Chevalier need not write a fully believable theory in order for her novel to be enjoyable, the conclusion should still be drawn that the work is a failure.  Whether she wishes to provide glimpse into the man known as Vermeer, or a work of looking at and being absorbed in imagination about art, or an obscure and flimsy seventeenth-century Dutch Romance, Chevalier can claim no victory.<BR> Vermeer, who has eluded historians with his relatively late rise to fame (centuries later) and the little known about him and relatively few paintings (thirty-five) believed existent, could not be the ambivalent hermit which Chevalier paints.  The character of Vermeer, far and away the easiest and most important character to make interesting, is a static, indifferent painter who paints the girlto please the lust of Van Ruijven and appease Griet, a maid, who refuses to sit and be in the concurrent The Concert with the same man.  We are made to believe Vermeer has fallen, at least in part, for this maid, and thus cannot paint her sitting with the sleazy aristocrat.  We are made also to believe Vermeer paints this portrait in secret from his jealous wife who has had it in for Griet since her arrival to clean Vermeer's studio, and that it so enrages his wife when she finds out the maid has worn her earring in the painting, that she births a sickly child a month early on the floor, in the middle of Vermeer's studio.   <BR> So, there's an elegant, rich, child-bearing wife and a maid of misfortune, hired to clean Vermeer's studio.  Griet cleans the studio with precision and perfection, measuring placements of items with arms lengths and returning them to the original position.  And, though it takes time for Vermeer to clarify his liking of Griet, from the beginning Griet is infatuated with Vermeer.  Chevalier almost seeks to write of a Jay Gatz instead of a Johannes Vermeer;  with Griet on a Gatsby-like quest to discover who the man with the palette really is.  <BR> But the Vermeer of the novel is so much less than the Vermeer of common myth and so much less worthy of a quest to discover.  The novelized Vermeer refuses to defend Griet when she does his bidding and is caught; refuses to side with his wife against Griet;  refuses to disobey rich patrons;  and, yet, also refuses to allow Griet to be painted with the town sleaze.  The negative inference is that this Vermeer cared about nothing but a perfect, finalized painting;  a nice mythical view of a real man but hardly a real view of a myth.  We are even treated to such pearls of (or, rather, perils to) wisdom as:  \\"You [Catherina] and the children are not part of this world...you are not meant to be\\" in response to why he has never painted his wife.   A weak character is Chevalier's Vermeer;  a man who bares no soul and appears, really, to have none to bear.  We are left, in the end, to wonder if he actually cares about anything beside his work and, if the answer is no, then we are left to wonder if the character, as written, could be so philosophical to think of separate spheres of art and life.<BR> Chevalier's painfully strained and stretched metaphors make the novel no less easier to digest:  Chevalier goes to such lengths to point them out that they are no fun and require no thought.   Chevalier explains where each tip of an eight pointed star leads, and allows Griet to wonder if she's chosen the right path.  A broken tile of Griet and her brother Franz, what could prove a savory metaphor in retrospect, is destroyed by Chevalier's didactic need to help the unintelligent reader by saying that the girl who broke it could never have known how true a prophecy it would become once the two siblings lose contact.  Finally, a knife sent spinning to floor at the hands of Catharina in Griet's house at the beginning of the novel is referenced multiple times to keep its memory fresh before a final showdown between Catherina and Griet concludes in the same result:  with the spinning knife ending with its point toward Griet.  Clearly by the flat characterization, Chevalier assumes the reader will be more attracted to Griet's molestations at the hands of Van Ruijven and her time in alleys with Pieter the son than with actual style<BR>The Verdict:  For a breezy pseudo-intellectual read, Girl With a Pearl Earring is sufficient.  For a real look at Vermeer, read Anthony Bailey's Vermeer:  View of Delft.  For a worthwhile combination of history and fiction, look elsewhere.
B000007MVD|5.0|If you are a serious Beatles' fan, you have got to have &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;. I happened to be listening to the radio (which I don't normally do) about twenty years ago when these songs were introduced to the public, I believe, for the first time. I am still playing the tapes I made off the air some twenty years ago today!!<br />I believe the version of &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; on this collection is the best rendition I have ever heard. Listen to &quot;Some Other Guy&quot; and you get some idea of the energy and enthusiasm that made The Beatles so very popular in the early days. Many, many great songs and short interviews rendering unique insight into The Beatles as the people they were all those years ago.

B00005OMTT|5.0|Enigma has never failed to amaze me with their mix of New age, Club, and rock.  They are probably the only group who have not put out one bad song in my opinion. <br />MCMXC had a very dark, Gothic feel. MCMXC to me is probably their best album even to this day after all these years. Sadeness mixed the use of Gregorian Chants, club beat and New Age to create one of the best New Age songs I,ve ever heard. <br />The follow-up CROSS OF CHANGES was almost completely different with a much brighter sound and less of the Gregorian Chants and instead incorporated some Native American and Maori chants. Return To Innocence is almost totally opposite to Sadeness because Innocence is very sunny where Sadeness was very dark. <br />LE MOR EST MORT VIVE LE ROI! was like the child of the two previous albums with the brightness of CROSS mixed in with the Gregorian sounds of MCMXC and with some new sounds that resulted in an album with a sort of aquatic sound. Child In Us is the best song on the CD. I almost call it the daytime version of Sadeness. <br />SCREEN BEHIND THE MIRROR is completely different from CROSS or LE ROI EST MORT. It had a much more sultry industrial medieval sound. I almost compare it more to MCMXC. The title track borrowed the drum loop from Sadeness. <br />This collection of songs from each of those albums showcases among some of the best works Cretu has ever come up with plus the songs still blend well even though they are from different albums. I never thought Mea Culpa could blend well into Push The Limits. <br />The big bonus to this CD that makes it stand out so well from other Greatest Hits CDs is the remixing of some of the tracks to give them a totally different feel. TNT for the Brain on it's parent album has a relatively poppish sound. The version on here, The Midnight Man Mix has a much darker, more ambient, sound and sounds far superior to the original.  The same goes for Principles of Lust. It's the remixing of some of the hits or singles that makessome greatest hits so wonderful(Madonnas Immaculate Collection is an example).<br />There are two new tracks, The Landing and Turn Around neither of which catch you immediately like their older stuff. <br />[This] is a worthy collection. Believe me it's worth owning just for the remix of TNT for the Brain and the whole disc runs at over 76 minutes.
B000063UR2|5.0|I saw &quot;Legend,&quot; during my first  spring in NYC in 1986.  Coincidentally, at the same time, I was working as a production assistant on another film, &quot;Angel Heart,&quot; written by the same author William Hjortsberg. <br />Despite the phenomenal  production design and trademark Ridley Scott visuals, the film always left me a little cold.  The Tangerine Dream score seemed a tad out of place  for a fantasy film such as this.  <br />The Director's  Cut is a much more satisfying experience.  It offers the chance to finally hear the Jerry (Star Trek the Movie) Goldmith's original  music,  which seems better suited to the film.  The scene when Lilly first encounters the unicorn, now feels a bit more like Eve in the Garden of Eden instead of a spoiled girl  misbehaving and causing a movie's worth of trouble.  In short, motivations in several scenes seem clearer.  Tom Cruise's &quot;Jack of the Green&quot; character feels largely the same.   In addition, the restoration and transfer is phenomenal.  The layered clear packaging is also very clever and a welcome change from the black boxes and universally hated snapper cases.   No wonder Ridley Scott signed his name on the case :)
B0000027RL|5.0|I got this CD in -- I think -- seventh grade when my music taste was pretty horrible, and I credit Ten with bettering it. I honestly don't care about all that \\"Kurt's better...no, Eddie's better...No, Layne's better...\\" I think it's irrelevant. What matters is the music, and this is some great music. Great guitars, hummable melodies, nice vocals, powerful lyrics...this CD has it. It's brimming over with emotion. The most beautiful moment here is undoubtedly \\"Release\\". Such a powerful song, and Eddie's voice is perfect for it. This sounds corny, I realize, but his soul just pours through those words... Each track works really well on its own, although perhaps a few work better separately than they do in the context of the CD. Definitely worthy of a purchase!!
0790729652|5.0|The great Tim Burton overhauled the campy 60's era Batman into a gothic, brooding vigilante that turned the way comic book movies being made on its ear.  I remember seeing this movie in the summer of 89 at the movies with my mom when I was a little kid, it wowed me then, and it wows me now.  Michael Keaton is the best Batman ever, and I don't blame him for not wanting any part of Joel Schumacher's chapters in the Batman saga.  Keaton is perfect as the dark brooding hero by night, and the millionaire playboy by day.  Jack Nicholson brings the Joker to a new level, making him a darkly humorous villian, and one of, if not the, greatest villian to ever appear in a comic based film.  I read reviews by people saying that the Joker was mean spirited, what a bunch of malarchy, if he wasn't mean spirited, then Nicholson's characterization would not have worked.  All in all, the first installment of the new Batman saga is still the best no matter what, and with the way the series is now, it will be the best of all time.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is such a great man for many reasons. One of them is, after making so many movies at Studio Ghibli, such greats as:<BR>* My Neighbor Totoro<BR>* Nausicaa of the valley of wind ---<BR>( his first with Ghibli, and at the same level, maybe higher, maybe lower, than Mononoke Hime.)<BR>* Pom Poko<BR>* Grave of the fireflies<BR>* Laputa: Castle in the Sky<br />He STILL can make an epic like Princess Mononoke. What a fantastic man! Princess Mononoke is indescribable in words, so I won't bore you by details. Just watch the movie, the animation, plot, music by faithful Joe Hisaishi, and overall feel will suredly blow you away, whether your an anime fanatic or not. But I would fell discontented to even call this an anime, among so much crap.  It's a freakin' subcategory! MIYAZAKI! The man even gets praise by fellow legends as<BR>Akira Kurosawa and Katsuhiro Otomo (may God rest his soul).<BR>  Another reason Miyazaki is so great is that, well... he is so darned hard-working, creative, and brilliant! I really despise computer animation, hand-drawn animation is the most creative, fluid, and inspiring in my mind. This movie is very exciting, and fun to watch. <BR> About the DVD, I recommend Japenese language with english sub-titles. I personally dislike the english version, though I do like Billy Bob Thorton's performance. <BR>DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:<BR>*Featurette<BR>*Theatrical Trailer<BR>*French language track<BR>*Japenese language track<br /> Well, all I can finish with is the fact that an epic was made, and many are sure to come by the great Hayao Miyazaki. Stay tuned for Spirited Away. ...       - Jeffro
0684171600|1.0|How can this possibly be a classic? Most of the time I had no idea what on earth the characters were saying. It's all in some kind of pirate-jive lingo. Practically a foriegn language. I thought that this was a childrens book. If I read this at the age of let's say 8, it would put me off reading for life. And it is so slow to start. I didn't enjoy reading this book and I was very disappointed. The drama is weak, the narrative is weak and boring. I felt nothing for the hero Hawkins. And towards the end it kind of built up to a big climax that never happened. I'd like to believe I read a fake version of Treasure Island and there is a much better and real version out there. But perhaps I should accept that this book, cherished and highly regarded by a lot of people, just didn't entertain me one iota.
B00005YXZH|2.0|At one time, Wilco really had it down. Take some country, throw in some pop, rock it out with some fuzzy guitars, throw this All-American amalgam around lots of great tunes, combine it with Jeff Tweedy's dry delivery, and boom - some of the best listening of the last few years. (Be sure to check out A.M. and Summerteeth - two very different yet very fine albums.)<br />Then along comes Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Sounds to me like they knew they had a bunch of boring mediocre songs, and the only &quot;solution&quot; was to go into the studio late at night and augment them with every electronic effect ever invented, hoping someone would see this hapless collection as the next Sgt. Pepper. Well, it didn't work! This is an album that should be played once and put back on the shelf, only to be rescued during extreme fits of insomnia.<br />Why did the critics love it so much? Simple. It was rejected by their label (Reprise) only to wind up in a bidding war, with Reprise getting back into the fray and losing to an indie! This is the stuff that makes music critics wet their pants. Problem is, they should have actually listened to the album.<br />Given two stars for great title and cool cover art. Let's hope their next one is a return to form.
B00005UW7V|1.0|I'm not a writer, but I watch a lot of movies and I thought this movie literally bites.  It was a disgrace to Spielberg and seems like this movie was made to, well, I have a lot of money so lets make a movie.  Who cares if it entertains.  The idea of artificial intelligence, our human race, what we think, what is becoming of society and technology are all thems that the director tried to define in 3 hours; portrayed through the emotions of the characters.  If I want an emotional roller coaster, then I can find one like most people; but I'm definitely not going to pay money for one.  This movie was kind of like making art just to make art for art's sake.  You know how you wonder where people get the time to do stupid things like stand in line for four months to see Star Wars?  I wonder who had the time to make this movie.  I'm sorry but I am easily entertained and like 90% of the movies I see (I'm definitely far from critical), but this movie was horrible.

B00003CWTH|1.0|Let me just say this movie was completely engaging, interesting and thought provoking, right up until it started raining frogs. Huh? I love how writers sometimes throw something into a story which is completely absurd and irrelevent and then try to pass it off as some kind of artsy smartsy thing. I thought and thought for some connection or metaphor that the frogs could represent. Did I miss something? What so brilliant about raining frogs? I could think of that. All in all, some nice performances, interesting stories and characters which no doubt some people could relate to, but it all crashed and burned with that ending.
B00004OCRN|5.0|This LP is absolutely the best recording of Bruce Springsteen available anywhere.  The title song is powerful, driving, and full of the energy, passion, and compassion Bruce's rock &amp; folk music embodies.  The acoustic version of Born to Run strips away the song to its essential core -- two people on the road looking for connection to each other and their community.  &quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot; and &quot;Be True&quot; are great singles full of energy and clarity.  This CD is a must have for anyone who likes Bruce Springsteen and the folk/rock genre.
B00005Q45W|1.0|I bought this last November and never thought of writing until today when I signed onto the site...While some people obviously really love this CD, I want to say that my initial reaction was real surprise.  I couldn't believe it was Cohen.  My children, who love Cohen, had the same reaction.  Each of the ten new songs sounds the same to me and it's not a fun kind of same.  I should have previewed more of the tracks.  Hopefully he will return to his normal self because his music is usually wonderful.
B000062XKL|4.0|This heist story has all of the familiar elements.  Indeed, it's a familiar movie, but that doesn't mean that it's not good.  The story details De Niro's last job where Brando asks him to steal a priceless sceptre from an inpenetrable building in his home town.<br />So what's different here?  Edward Norton is the key element in this movie.  De Niro is an excellent actor but Norton simply has the more interesting role, and he certainly uses it to the best of his abilities.  Anyone who's seen 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' is no doubt aware of what Norton is capable of.  Here he plays the guy on the inside, passing himself off as a mentally-challenged cleaner whilst secretly he's a high-tech crook.  Both parts he keeps up in the air perfectly.<br />At the end of the day this is one where everything that you expect to happen does, right down to the obligatory twist at the end.  Still, it's efficient enough, especially in the actual heist itself even if I did find myself rooting for the wrong guy at the end.
B00005Y228|5.0|I remember hearing Kylie's first hit way back in 1997 with &quot; I Should Be So Lucky&quot; and Kylie's style of bubble gum pop has been my teenage years music staple diet ever since. Then in the early nineties she sort of disappered as Kylie dabbled with alternative and punk rock music which is not too bad though I prefer her bubble gum radio friendly pop stuff except Did It Again from impossible Princess album. In 2001 I remember seeing the video of Spinning Around from the CD- Light Years and that signals to me Kylie's long awaited return to pop.  Light Years have 3 great tracks- Spinning Around, Your Disco Needs You (A great cross between Village People and Pet Shop Boys) and Kids with Robbie Williams. With Fever, I screamed when I first heard CGYOOMH because it is so cool- musically and stylistically. It is like an updated retro disco track. Love Fever aboslutely.
0804106304|5.0|I read this book for World Literature presentation. I saw the movie before I read this book. I pretty liked that movie too. <BR>I challenge you to read this book with dry eyes. <BR>This book tells us that author; Amy Tan explores the different mother-daughter relationships between the characters, and at a lower level, relationships between friends, lovers, and even enemies. This book is organized into four sections, two devoted to the mother and two devoted to the daughters, with the exception of June. The first section, logically, is about the mothers' childhoods in China, the period of time during which their personalities were molded. And the second and third sections are about the daughters' lives, and the vignettes in each section trace their personality growth and development. The mothers' describes through the eyes of the daughters. <BR>I strongly recommend this book. You guys should read this book. And Tan's novel is a worthy read.

B00005ASOC|5.0|I felt that this was a fabulous movie for many reasons.  First, the actors that they chose to play the parts were wonderful.  Sean Connery as William Forrester was a great part.  I felt that the caliber of actors that were present in this film really helped to make it a great work.  The story line and plot of the movie were also great, which helped to make the movie very easy to watch.  I believe that throughout this show the author was trying to get across two main points:  Things are never as they may seem, and you cannot try to predict how another person will act.  <BR> The story opened with a young black kid from the Bronx, Jamal Wallace.  At the beginning he is like any other high school kid trying hard to fit in at school.  He knows that he is smart and loves to write books, but he does not feel that this will gain him any attention at school.  Instead of using his brain to make him excel, he uses his basketball skills.  This is how he finds a link between himself and the world.  Eventually he takes a standardized test that catches the attention of some private schools.  Jamal visits these schools but does not know whether he wants to leave his friends.  He is left with the choice of staying where he is or pursuing his future at a private school, where he has the chance to excel in his writing and basketball, and possibly a love life.  <BR> As he is dealing with this he has another matter on his mind.  He has become friends with an old hermit (Sean Connery) who never leaves his downtown apartment.  Throughout the story these two characters become better friends.  They help one another to become better people.  Each one of these characters  does some unexpected things that change the tide of the friendship.  The entire movie really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster.  At times you find yourself really excited about the movie, while at other times you find it hard to watch because it is so sad.   <BR> This movie also has some interesting aspects that really add to the overall effect of it.  First, the use of the African American dialect adds to the believability of the movie.  In some movies the use of slang terms detracts from the movie, but it really helps to exemplify what this situation might have actually been like in this case.  <BR> The only part of the movie that is bad is some of the cuts between scenes.  There are some very awkward cuts that leave the viewer wondering how they got from one scene to the next.  This is not a major factor in deciding whether the movie was good or not, but it does seem to distract the viewer somewhat.  <BR> Overall this is a great movie.  The author put a great deal of time into making a wonderful story line that really holds the reader's attention.  You can also learn a great deal about life through watching this movie.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has the desire to see a serious movie, that will not bore you to sleep.
B000002N25|2.0|I'm a big Knopfler fan, and love his work with Dire Straits and his other solo album, Sailing To Philadelphia.  This one starts strong with two rocking, upbeat songs with Mark's trademark guitar licks.  But after that, every song sounds like the guy is on Prozac.  I cannot recommend purchasing this album.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Careful -- Many of these reviews are full of spoilers.  The most fun thing about this movie is trying to figure out what's going on.  Some of these other reviews give you the most plausible interpretation, which you would otherwise have no chance of divining until at least 3/4 of the way through the movie (personally, I didn't really figure it out until the end credits started to roll).  It's just not the same experience if you know ahead of time.
B000063UR2|5.0|Good news is that it is finally on dvd and you finally get to see the whole movie in the Director's cut, but the bad news is Goldsmith's score. To me it doesn't compare with Tangerine Dreams score which I think brings the movie to life. I don't know if it was the theater or when the movie came out on VHS that I saw legend for the first time, but I remember a lot of the parts that are in the Director's cut. When I seen the movie again years later I noticed the missing scenes, it is great to have them back. I just wish the full length cut had Tangerine Dreams Score, but o'well it is still a great DVD.
0446677450|3.0|The thoughts are good, and worth hearing.   The author constantly uses &quot;Rich Dad&quot; in each sentence where the advice or example is used, such as &quot;I really learned from Rich Dad.&quot;  After 3 chapters of hearing &quot;Rich Dad&quot; this and &quot;Rich Dad&quot; that instead of hearing the guy's name, I threw the book on the floor and haven't picked it back up.
B000002LJW|4.0|The title &quot;Journeyman&quot; would appear to be a bit of modesty by an artist who has been a towering figure in rock music for nearly thirty years.  And yet it is quite appropriate.  Clapton has never seemed entirely comfortable under the glare of the spotlight, and much of his best work has been collaboartive (Cream, Derek and the Dominoes, Blind Faith, etc).  How else to explain such Clapton diversions as his time spent as the lead guitarist on Roger Waters's debut solo album (&quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitchiking&quot;) and tour?<br />With &quot;Journeyman,&quot; Clapton produced his prototypical album.  There are a couple of decent singles written by an outside songwriter (&quot;Pretending&quot; and &quot;No Alibis&quot;) a couple of covers of rock and blues standards (&quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;) a longer guitar jam (&quot;Breaking Point&quot;) and a lot of decent filler material in between.  For all his talents as a musician, Clapton has never been a first rate songwriter, and as a result even his best albums tend to be uneven.  While &quot;Journeyman&quot; is no exception to that rule, it is still one of his better solo efforts.
055321263X|5.0|Have you ever been interested to read a Victorian era \\"classic\\" but never got around to it because you are concerned that you may not be able to relate? This is the book for you.<br /><br />If they had airports in the Victorian era this book would be a common sight. I mean this in a complimentary way, not equating Wilkie Collins with modern day blockbusting purveyors of crap like Stephenie Meyer or Dan Brown. This is an edge of the seat thriller that will soon have you forgetting that you reading something written over a century ago. The Woman in White is one of the earliest works of detective fiction and predates Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes by decades.<br /><br />The Woman in White is not actually about the titular lady with her predilection for colorless attires, though she plays a significant part. The story is about two sisters (stop rolling your eyes back there! this is cool!) one beautiful, kind and vulnerable (OK, she is a bit lame) and the other not so pretty but tough as nails and sharp as a tack. Laura Fairlie (the pretty one) with her excessive niceness is ripe for exploitation and the dastardly handsome Sir Percival Glyde (to whom she is pledged) does not hesitate to do so at the first opportunity. To make matters worse he is aided and abetted by a smooth talking ingenious villain Count Fosco. At this point special mention must be made for two favorite characters from the opposite ends of the moral spectrum. Count Fosco must be one of the most formidable villains in literature, but what make him particularly interesting is his charm, humor, eccentricity and moments of goodness. Fortunately Laura has her own WMD in her half-sister Marian Halcombe, a totally badass Victorian lady who centuries later probably reincarnated as Ellen Ripley. Marian's strong character and resolution really shines through, she comes across as much more heroic than the novel's hero, Walter Hartright who is rather bland and almost useless.<br /><br />Wilkie Collins has performed an amazing feat of character development in this book, Marian Halcombe and Count Fosco are so vivid they practically jump out of the book at you, you may want to stand well back while reading the book as a precaution. The plot twists and turns in unexpected manners and the final resolution is deeply satisfying. No lover of mystery novels should miss this classic. Beautifully written with very strong characterization, the Woman in White is more than a match to any modern day thriller.<br />Read this and the equally fabulous [[ASIN:159308322X The Moonstone (Barnes & Noble Classics)]] by the same author then brag about it to everybody until they start throwing things at you.development in this book, Marian Halcombe and Count Fosco are so vivid they practically jump out of the book at you, you may want to stand well back while reading the book as a precaution.

B00005JLFC|5.0|To the expert, true Hasidic Jew who condemned this excellent film... perhaps a bit of education in human sexuality is in order. Having read \\"Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy\\", seen a production of the play & this film, it is quite clear that Yentl is NOT A TRANSGENDERED individual! That implies an actual sex change operation. Yentl could possibly be called a transvestite, though many \\"actual, true, real\\" transvestites might dispute this as Yentl is actually more of a \\"male impersonator\\" than anything else. I do not feel this film in any way paints a negative image of contemporary Hasidic Jews. It is dated to about 1904 (not 2002!) and I sincerely doubt that Streisand, a renound perfectionist, was portraying anyone falsely for THAT TIME PERIOD.<br />It appears this reviewer has his own personal animosities toward Streisand because nothing about the actual film itself is discussed. Perhaps this is because Barbra is clearly not an orthodox or Hasidic Jew herself.<br />So who's agenda is being pushed by who?
0385335482|4.0|I didn't take the book so seriously...*I* liked Rebecca because even though she is a larger-than-life exaggerated twenty-something, there are still many truths most of us share. Really, how many of us have not wanted to open our Visa statements? How many of us BELIEVED we would win the lotto and be saved financially (or at least had good fun spending the money in our heads). How many of us buy things to cheer us up? The book isn't perfect, but i didn't expect it to be. It's a fun read.
B0000214F0|5.0|I recently viewed the unrated version of \\"Caligula.\\"  I wasn't expecting much since it was a film sponsored by Penthouse magazine.  What I got was a real film treat.  The acting is wonderful (Oscar callibar).  The visuals are intense and often disturbing.  The word graphic definitely comes to mind here.<br />For those of you who are interested, this movie DOES, however, contain some hardcore sexual acts.  There is gratutitous nudity (both male and female).  Sexual acts are portrayed in ways that are as candid and honest as those in adult films.  Do not watch the unrated version of this film with small children or if you are easily offended.
B000063JDE|2.0|I like Lynch. Dune-good. Wild At Heart-good. Twin Peaks-good. Mullholland Dr.-great. Blue Velvet-BAD. Now most Lynch fans would hate me. They would say i dont know what i'm talking about. Well i dont know why but i almost couldnt finish this film. It was just awful. It was werid and some parts were interesting but in the whole there are other lynch films i would rather watch. I think Mullholland Dr. is his best picture. It requries many viewings in order to figure it out so i would suggest gettin that instead. I do think that this movie is definatley worth a watch. I just think it was one of lynch's poorer films.
B000066C1N|5.0|Michelle Branch is the artist and the name of the song is &quot;You Set Me Free&quot;
B000007T1M|5.0|I bought both this Cd and Toxicity at the same time and this seems to be my favorite. The songs on this cd are more diverse than then the second. None of the the music sounds the same. I personally think that Needles and Deer Dance, X and jet Piolet, and Science and Forest on the second cd sound very much alike. Also the lyrics on this Cd are a lot easier to decifer and cover a much broader range of topics, from mind control, to suicide, to wrath about the Armenian Genocide. The single Sugar is definetely not one of the best tracks on the cd, and spiders is the only softer track on the cd. My favorite songs on this CD are SuitePee, Know, Suggestions, Soil, War, Peephole,and P.L.U.C.K. However, all the songs on this cd are awesome. There are no filler tracks on this cd and you are bound to love the whole thing. Chances are that if you like this Cd you will also like the second one.
B00004YRQA|5.0|this little card is too sweet, i bought the japanese version and was at first a little hesitant, but it plays just like normal and it loads in seconds and carries a whole lot.<BR>many recomend other types for the ps2, but i think its safer to use the sony version since if it messes up, they will fix it for you. and since the ps2 is sony, why not just stick with it, the intel one is probably a buck cheaper but in the long run, you may find the sony one a whole load more reliable and less [costly].
0060935464|5.0|To think, I almost got away with never reading this book, thankfully a friend recommended it.  The lessons in it were not lost on me.  If only all children were given the opportunities Scout was given by her father.  I can read this book over and over again!
1573222038|5.0|I have become a great fan of Ms. Water's work.  _Tipping the Velvet_ remains my all-time favorite, but this almost tops it -- Great fiction, no matter what your lifestyle.  A richly detailed story of love and betrayal set in 1860's England.<br />The two heroines, Sue and Maud, live nearly parallel lives except for their social class.  Sue grows up on the mean streets of London slums, Maud in the gilded cage of the English countryside.  Both are confined by their circumstances, both seek a way out.  When the opportunity presents itself in the form of a con man named Gentleman, they leap at the chance.  Little do they now what his plan has in store for them.<br />Fingersmith is full of twists, each more surprising than the other.  I got this on Mother's Day and finished it the following Thursday.  I couldn't get enough!
0425180638|5.0|I hardly ever read a book with a plot such as this one. But, this book held my attention to the very end. I highly recommend it to anyone who reads about mistry,romance and intrigue.
0767802470|5.0|Ok, sorry for that title, I'm not really into that kind of speech, but you're reading this, so I guess it worked.<BR>I finally bought this movie after years of decision. I had always been intimidated by the German language aspect. I have watched dubbed movies before. Godzilla movies. I guess they don't spend as much money doing a good job on cheesy Japanese B movies. This movie was fantastic. The first time I watched it, I watched it in the english dubbed version, as I didn't want to spend 3 hours reading text, I wanted to feel the movie, and watch the movie unhindered by the text. <BR>I made my girlfriend watch it, and she too, was intimidated by the length and the dubbed aspect. 3 hours later she was totally blown away. I asked her if she was rooting for the Germans. She said yes, and at that very moment she probably became enlightened to the fact that a soldier is a human, regardless of their land of origin. At least I hope she got that idea, I'm a male, and we dont always have good track records with reading minds. <BR>Anyhow, aside from all my silliness, this is a very, very superb DVD. I can't critique the film as compared to the unedited one, as I had not previously seen it, my apologies.
B0000640SA|3.0|i love this movie! it's ok, but i am so disapointed the new limited version is NOT a widescreen version! despite all previews  said it is  an anamorphic version, IT IS NOT!<BR>i bought the limited version and i am not happy! SO I WANT TO TAKE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO SELL THEIR OLDER VERSION TO BUY THIS ONE : IT IS A BAD IDEA(to watch the film in high condition)!<BR>bonuses are amazing and very interesting and the packaging is the best i ever seen after FIGHT CLUB and SE7EN! but the aspect ratio is still very important because the film itself is the most important thing in a DVD!!!!!!!
B00003CXCS|5.0|I really don't feel the need to tell you my opinion of the movie since there are hundreds of other reviews out there. This review is if you are considering upgrading your VHS to the DVD.  I HIGHLY recommend the DVD.  A one-hour making of documentary, theatrical trailers, great stuff.  Definitely one of the better DVD &quot;extra&quot; packages out there.
B00005R2M3|5.0|All right, I must admitt; I hadn't even heard of Shakira at all until about four months ago.  But when I first saw her hit, \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", on MTV, I loved it.  Every time my dad travelled to the States (we are living in West Africa for three years, as my dad is the American Ambassador in Togo) I would beg him to look as hard as possible for the CD.  Finally, he did find it, and by the way, I'm listening to it as I write this.    <BR>  Here's a review of each song: <BR> 1. Objection (Tango)-I was totally drawn to this song right away, mostly because of its awesome rythm and how it almost perfectly describes the situation I was in at the time...but I won't go into details about that.  You can't help singing along to this, and the beat makes you want to get up and dance.  <BR> 2. Underneath Your Clothes-a lovely song about true love under a show of indifference.  Shakira really throws herself into this one, and it's another one to get hooked on right away.  <BR> 3. Whenever, Wherever-yet another song to make you get up and dance.  With a catchy tune and a wonderful display of Shakira's vocal talents, this is certainly a hit track. <BR> 4. Rules-a happy song, with a bit of pop and sounding a bit 90's.  Not that it's bad at all!  A feel-good song, about sticking together and staying faithfull because we are meant to be.  <BR> 5. The One-this song leans more towards a ballad, but with the guitar techniques it is turned into something more.  Starts off slow, then picks up until you are swept along with the music. <BR> 6. Ready For The Good Times-this is about being independent and having a good time only for yourself.  A good, strong beat and she really uses her voice. <BR> 7. Fool-this song is definitely one of my favorites.  I suppose it could be considered soppy, but I just see it as beautiful and I can totally relate to it.  Excellent for a broken-heart-but-not-quite-over-it situation.<BR> 8. Te Dejo Madrid-another favorite.  This is a good song for getting ready to go out and have fun; it's a hanging out, fun song.  And she sings just as beautiful in Spanish as in English! In addition, the harmonica solo is done by none other than Shakira herself.<BR> 9. Poem To A Horse-more bitter, this one.  It may seem a bit weird at first, but is very catchy.  It's one of those songs that make you really think. <BR> 10. Que Me Quedes Tu-if I had to choose one, this would probably be my least favorite, but that's not to say it isn't good.  This is an easy listening song, the kind that would just flow into your head.  Another Spanish track.<BR> 11. Eyes Like Yours-many have called this a bit odd, but I adore it.  It introduces a bit of her Lebanese heritage in it, and has a very haunting beat.  It's a great song to work out a dance routine to (I know; I've done it with my Lebanese friend!) and it's one that will stay stuck in your head all day.  Plus there's some really cool Arabic singing included.<BR>  Then there are \\"Objection\\" and \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" in Spanish, which is very cool although she had to change the lyrics around to make it rhyme.  <BR>  All in all, this CD is one that everyone should buy.  Shakira is really admirable; she's been singing since she was 12.  Her voice is beautiul and strong, and she puts actual feeling into her singing (unlike many popular artits these days).  Many of my friends don't appreciate her like I do, and I can only say \\"Their loss!\\"  An absolutely wonderful CD (and she even wrote most of it!)  Keep up the good work, Shakira!  I'll be watching for the next wave.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Brandon Boyd's voice is a perfect compliment to the wonderful music on this CD.  Everyone should feel privilaged to listen to a band like Incubus!  The best band to come along in a very long time!  Love it!
020161622X|5.0|This is truly one of the best books I've read. The authors distill decades of experience through a series of good, to-the-point advice that is just indispensable for programmers.<br />Perhaps what I liked most about this book is that it is simple (but powerful) and to the point, but still with plenty of *relevant* code examples. Instead of wandering through blah-blah-blah and making the book huge (which seems to be the case with most computer-related books these days) the authors do a great job of sticking to the purposes of the book.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I actually haven't seen the DVD yet but I can't wait for it to come out!  I saw this movie four times in the theater and I can't wait to see it again plus see extra footage!  I've read all the books since seeing this movie and although I'm sure they won't be as good as the writings, I'm excited for the film sequels.
0767903862|5.0|This is a great book! I would recommend it to anyone. It is funny entertaining and Bill Bryson is an awesome author. This book deserves 50 stars not just 5. This book will really come in handy and I recommend it to everyone.
B000002U9L|3.0|I was a little disappointed when I listened to this soundtrack. I absolutely love the ballroom song, \\"As the World Falls Down,\\" but the one on the soundtrack is different than the one on the movie. It's faster and more keyboardy. I liked the movie one better. The \\"Magic Dance\\" song is different on the soundtrack also. David Bowie makes the baby sounds and it sounds really [not real]. The backup singers sound bad too. <BR>The rest of the songs were pretty good though--especially \\"Underground.\\"<BR>I have to keep reminding myself that these are songs from the 80's and they are a little different from what I remember them to be when I saw this movie when I was about 6. The smart thing the producers did with this movie was have David Bowie star in it. I would otherwise not be a David Bowie fan.
0004723724|5.0|Oscar Wilde was a self-described man of paradox. He was, simultaneously, a man very much of his time, and also very ahead of his time. He was a highly moral man who wrote clever epigrams about how good it is to be wicked (\\"Wickedness is a myth invented by good people to account for the curious attractiveness of others.\\") He was a happily married man who happily loved his two children but also led a gay life on the side and wrote hilarous satires of love and marriage (\\"Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.\\") This huge book, which contains practically everything that Wilde ever wrote, shows the man in all his glory. After the introduction by his son, we are first launched into Oscar's stories. His one novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a classic and a masterpiece. A devastating moral tale, this one deserves to be in everyone's library. His shorter pieces, however, are of a more questionable quality. Consisting mostly of moral ancedotes dressed up in the thinly-veiled guise of fairy tales for children, these works are the least exciting part of Wilde's oeuvre and of this book, and seem to lean heavily on his oft-spouted crutch of \\"Art for Art's sake.\\" After the stories, we meet Wilde in the guise he was destined for: that of a dramatist. His play were an integral and ackwnoledged part of his genius, and their influence upon modern drama was enormous. His type of high, farcial \\"drawing room\\" comedy has left a permanent mark on the stage. It is easy to see how even the modern Hollywood sitcom sprung from these plays of Wilde's. However funny and biting the satire may be, though, the high point of Oscar Wilde's plays was always his epigram-laced dialogue - whatever the plot may be. Probably the finest - and most biting - aphorist the English language has ever produced, Wilde is probably quoted - whether people realize it or not - more often than any other source in the language, aside from The Bible and Shakespeare. The Importance of Being Earnest and Salome are his ackwnoledged masterpieces, but other plays - such as A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband - are very good plays as well. He also has some very fine and underrated less original works, such as The Duchess of Padua that are quite well worth reading. From here, we move into Wilde's poems. Although, as he himself admits, they sometimes contain \\"more rhyme than reason\\", there is no doubting that Wilde was a master of language, and a fine poet. He won the Newdigate Prize for Poetry while at Oxford, and his \\"Ballad of Reading Gaol\\" is one of the finest poems in existence. What's left are his essays and letters. The most famous of them - indeed, one of the most famous letters ever written - is De Profundis, his strangely moving and tragic love/hate letter to Lord Alfred Douglas from prison. This is a shocking and immensely moving piece of work, and deserves to be read by one and all for its unique look into the human psyche - particuarly that of a man under intense suffering, and possibly on the brink. The letter is fascinating, and should put a different spin on Wilde than many people inaccurately have of the man - he was obviously of a very high moral character. Several interesting essays are also included - among them are The Critic As Artist and The Decay of Lying, two masterful pieces of Plato-istic dialogue, putting Wilde's severe wit and intimidating intellectualism on full display for all to see. One may wonder how much he actually believes of what he writes, but what he writes is brilliant. Another interesting essay is The Portrait of Mr. W.H., in which Wilde puts forth an interesting and unique theory about Shakespeare's sonnets. Also, while Wilde was not generally known for his political opinions, it is quite interesting to read his essay on political and social reform, The Soul of Man Under Socialism, as well as two letters he wrote about proposed reformations of the prison system.<br />All in all, thisis a collection of masterful writings from one of the most tragically overlooked and underrated writers in the whole of literature. As another reviewer has pointed out, while Wilde rarely gets the credit he deserves for his work - and is often ignored, overlooked, or simply dismissed - his works are also widely and frequently plagarised - not to mention quoted legitimately - and were obviously extremely influential. You owe it to yourself to read the man's writings if you are not familar with his works; I guarantee you you won't regret it.
B000001AJG|4.0|I'm another of the very few (apparently) who saw the movie, &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;. I had waited months for Stevie Wonder's album, &quot;Stevie Wonder's Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants&quot;, to come out. I knew it was somehow tied with the movie, that I knew precious little about, but I bought it simply because it was his next release after &quot;Looking Back&quot;, which was an anthology-type release. I'm not sure if the album or the movie came out first. All I know is that it seemed I would never see the movie - as if it had fallen into a black hole - I was totally in love with the album. It was tender, it was innovative, and although not aimed at pop in the same way as his other albums, it did have at least two hits. The flavor of the whole, though, was somewhat intoxicating; almost mystical, but as down to earth as dirt, water, and a growing bud.<br />Finally, with hardly any fanfare at all, the movie was shown at an art house/underground movie theatre in Dallas. I think Stevie's album, &quot;Hotter Than July&quot; had already eclipsed &quot;Secret Life&quot;, which for most people seemed to be an album made for a movie that was never released.<br />Frankly, I *did* like the movie. I only saw it once. It was strictly a documentary. And it focused on the idea of plants having feelings, etc. - how plants respond to certain music (growing taller with classical, for instance), how they respond to &quot;pain&quot; (two plants in different pots, both with electrodes... chop one up, and the other registers the event with a needle on the scope). I remember thinking how frustrating it must have been for a vegetarian who didn't eat meat because they didn't want anyone to suffer. As a documentary, it was probably a little heavy-handed, but it nothing else, it inspired a beautiful album from Stevie Wonder. If you are a Wonder fan, your collection is incomplete without his &quot;Journey&quot;. In some ways, I think that album used old technology toinspire the idea of sampling, because he did some very interesting things with bird chirps in his rhythm tracks, which would have been most easily accomplished with the digital sampling to come.<br />The four instead of five stars or only because it strays enough from R&amp;B/pop to make it possibly inaccessible or indefinable to some.
630407185X|4.0|This video portrays with great precision in an almost acted documentary way the failed attempt in September 1944 to end WWII early based on the plan conceived by Field Marshall Bernard Law Montgomery of El-Alemain (with Eisenhower's approval).The Allies by this time had advanced deep into Belgium almost to The Dutch border but the advance suddenly slowed due to their out-running  lines of supply and their inability to take a servicable port intact nearer their front line.Supplies were still being transported from the won Normandy beachheads a distance of over 500 miles.<BR>The Plan involved dropping British, American and Polish paratroopers at strategic bridges in the Netherlands such as The Son, The Grave, Nijmegen, to be taken by the American 82nd and 101st Airborne and the prize, Arnhem to be taken and held by British paratroops.Once all these bridges were captured and held, The British 1st Army would drive up the road linking them, thus giving the Allies a springboard to the Rhine and Germany.It was code-named &quot;Operation Market Garden&quot;, Market being the airborne drop and Garden the drive up the road.That was the theory.<BR>The planners overlooked,by ignoring seemingly on purpose aerial reconnaisance photos which indicated that Dieter's SS Panzers were resting and re-equipping in the Arnhem area. The Allies' communications equipment had not been tested thoroughly enough e.g. &quot;walkie-talkies&quot;  worked in open country but what about in built-up areas?Did they have the right sort of crystals fitted?The daily air drops to re-supply lightly armed paratroops could not work if the paras were not in their coded/designated drop zones.<BR>Amazingly after the strategic withdrawal from Arnhem, Montgomery is purported to have said it was &quot;90% successful&quot;! <BR>This film, directed by Richard Attenborough, was made in 1977 with a galaxy of well known stars i.e.:Dirk Bogarde as General Boy Browning,Lawrence Olivier, Liv Uhlman,Ryan O'Neal, James Caan,Robert Redford, Gene Hackman,Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery and Michael Caine.They all play historical figures but for me the most effective was Edward Fox playing General Sir Brian Horrocks.The latter presented a UK TV series  on WWII in the 1960's and Fox's mannerisms and speech patterns were unerringly similar.Please bear in mind that since the recent film &quot;The Saving of Private Ryan&quot;, special effects in war films have gone up a quantum leap, e.g. the havoc that bullets/bombs/morters etc can wreak on the human body.So you are looking at 1977 special effects.Nevertheless the equipment including the DC3's and filming of the actual paratroopers drop into The Netherlands was most impressive.Sometimes the dialogue is a little stilted to modern tastes but this is or should be speech patterns from 1944.It was General Boy Browning who stated &quot;...but sir, I think we may be going a bridge too far&quot; when he met with the Allied top brass to oversee the plan which he had to execute.This is certainly one of the seminal WWII war films and the only one which concentrates on this failed strategy to liberate the Low Countries.<BR>If you can forget the famous actors and get into their characters and have a sense of modern history, this long film will stimulate you.
6305781427|5.0|I just bought this on 5-17-02 and the sound and picture was great, I just used the Stereo 2 channel digital and was blown away with the great sound. The picture on the dvd was very close to perfect, for it's age it is a real pleaser, I like it more than his Tribute dvd which was great too..
B000063USY|4.0|I watched this movie when it first came out in theatres and I enjoyed it immensely. The movie is based on an undercover cop (Paul Walker) who becomes associated with a street car racer (Vin Diesel) to investigate merchandise stealing in the street car racing world. The action scenes that involve car flips and chases are unbelievable! There must have been a lot of new technology coupled with video editing to get the scenes perfect. The stunt people looked like the best in the business. The one thing about this movie that parents need to know is that it's not for kids. The mix of sex and violence is strong during some moments. The acting is also superb by rising young stars Paul Walker and Vin Diesel who are on their way to great careers. Two thumbs up!
B0000640SA|4.0|I love this movie and I'm very happy about this limited edition. But unlocking the special features has me tearing my hair out. I got most of them but I think there's more to be seen. The dvd gives you a series of questions which may or may not get you closer to the features. The point is, if your memory is bad... forget it!!! If anyone out there has sucessfully unlocked all the features please write in and help us out. <BR>Aside from that, the film looks great. The DTS is as always, the only way to listen. The commentary is essential to understanding some of the meanings behind the movie that you don't always pick up. Thought provoking, bewildering, and any other big word there is. Guy Pearce not only has a memory problem but he's also blonde. If you've found this review confusing, I'm just trying to fit in with the film and the dvd. So I appeal to everyone who reads this. I need help! This dvd has proven to me that my memory is completely in question. Thank you for listening. I've just spent 4 hours trying to unlock these bloody features and now I need a drink. Cheers.
B000063UR2|5.0|This Ultimate Edition DVD is amazing.  I remember seeing this film when I was a kid, and Tim Curry as Darkness gave me nightmares for weeks.  So when I heard that it was out on DVD, I just had to buy it.<br />I remember the film fondly (despite being petrified by the rather satanic looking Darkness), but now I can't imagine why.  Set more as a fairy tale than a fantasy epic like Lord of the Rings, the U.S. Theatrical Version is one of the most flawed fantasy films I have ever seen.  Poorly paced, little character development, and exceptionally bad editing in some transitions.  So imagine my surprise when I popped the new Director's Cut into the old DVD machine.  Although the extra length means that the film (which already lacks much action) might seem a little slow, as a fantasy film, it is breath-taking.  Not only do the extra minutes help the pacing and character development, the new edit adds much to make transitions less jarring and scenes more coherent.  In particular the interaction between Lily and Darkness (a new classic in my mental catalog), as well as the film's ending (no longer feels like an 80's music video), are vastly improved.  I prefer the Goldsmith score - it's more subtle and classical (and hence fairy-tale-like) than the &quot;hipper&quot; 80's-synth Tangerine Dream.<br />Of course, for those that prefer the U.S. Theatrical Version, you get that too with this set.  However, the video and sound quality are not as good as in the Director's Cut - it's flat with poor color balance and noticeable scratches and compression artifacts.  For me, the inclusion of the U.S. Theatrical Version is a nice bonus, but I don't see myself watching it again anytime soon.  The Director's Cut, on the other hand, will see frequent play.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones certainly has received plenty of good press, but I felt I must voice my enthusiasm and pleasure with this record.  The music is a wonderful mix of jazz, country and pop influences.<br />Norah's voice is very characteristic - \\"smokey and sweet.\\"  She's does not try to knock you over with vocal hystrionics like some of the current \\"divas,\\" but rather draw you in with an understated sexy, yet vulnerable style that is completely refreshing...especially given the bulk of today's pop music direction.<br />As a veteran musician, I can tell you that the musicianship is top-notch.  The production is also refreshingly understated yet very, very tasty.  At first I was wishing there was more playing (like a guitar solo on the bluesy \\"turn me on\\", or some additional piano from Norah) but the more I listen the more I love the cool, understated presentment of the music.<br />If you are looking for an exclusively jazz-based CD, this perhaps is not your stuff (suggest Diana Krall for that).  But if you are into a variety of music and don't mind a fresh mix of influences, this is your CD.  I recommend it 100% for folks who love finely crafted, simple but solid, music.  Norah may be only 22 years old, but this record demonstrates great maturity as a musican and singer.  She gives me hope that there are indeed some good new artists coming up to carry the flag.
0380789035|5.0|...but I had never read Gaiman before and judged this book on the cover (and, of course, the excerpt I read here). Needless to say, the cliche was wrong! Putting aside all bells and whistles, this book was wonderful. Even if you don't necessarily enjoy it, you'll find something to enjoy in this novel.<br />I heartly recommend &quot;American Gods&quot; to anyone who enjoys the English language, as Mr. Gaiman has a wonderful command over it. The only problem with this book is finding a prominent enough space on my bookshelf for it.
0896762173|5.0|I had checked this book out of my high school library, er. . .almost 20 years ago (can it be)? It was one of those that I'd check out over and over again. Something reminded me of it the other day, and now I'm going to buy it, yeah!<BR>The illustrations and descriptions are excellent.
B00005N9CV|2.0|It was nice when the handlers allowed Diana Krall to be a jazz musician.  Her piano playing was excellent, her vocal timbre and timing were divine.  This CD is great if you like elevator music.  The strings wash over and bleach out the music.  For good jazz from Krall go back to her earliest efforts.
1587990717|5.0|I am told Taleb's mathematics ring true; my experience tells me his illustrations drawn from the market certainly do.<br />It is rare when a sound scientific book renders itself entertaining, helpful and useful for the general public.  Writing in a narrative style, Taleb tackles induction, survivorship bias and whether we, as humans, are equipped to face the modern world.  The book is about luck and the fools who claim credit for what are often random events.<br />Stick with the book.  It has applications in science, finance, politics and business.  But beware; a thorough understanding of Taleb's thesis will shake your understanding of universe to its core.
B00004Z459|5.0|This band is the the tightest group i've ever heard. They mix, rap and rock, and do it well. Chester has an amazing voice, and Mike is one of the dopest rappers i've ever heard. All of there songs sound different, none are alike, which is DOPE. The album gives u a mixture of songs, alltogether...this CD is something you should buy, i was a HUGE fan of Hip hop, and loved 2Pac, but now this is all i listen to. There are amazing.
1573226521|5.0|I liked &quot;The beach&quot; very much.<br />Garland tells the story of Richard (the author's alter-ego?), an english boy who is traveling through SE Asia, specifically Thailand. One night he lies awake and engages in a conversation with a most strange character, who talks (while smoking a joint) about a heavenly beach nearby.<br />The next morning, Richard discovers that the strange man has commited suicide, but he also discovers a drawn map informing him how to reach the beach.<br />From then on Garland describes the odissey Richard and some friends endure to get to the famous beach. And then their life in the months they spend in the beach community.<br />Although written in the most casual way, this book is rich in character development, not only regarding the main character, who is also the narrator, but of Richard's closest friends and acquaintances on the beach as well. Richard, however, is the most complex, even though he is not aware of the fact. Garland constructed Richard to be almost a symbol of the person who watched Apocalypse Now in the early teens and is fascinated by a world of adventures, jungles, asiatic people with menacing looks pointing firearms. Richard is so alienated from reality that he sees everything as a kind of game, like the ones he enjoys so much.<br />This is a nice and fast read complex in its apparent simplicity.
B00005RYL9|4.0|If youre a Queen fan and you where waiting for any DVD clips; well on this DVD set you will find 2 discs; dont fool your self; only one of them is a DVD, the other is a music CD.<BR>The DVD contains the Highlander movie with cool extras in which you will find still pictures and more but the most important are the 3 Queen clips: Who wants to live for ever, A kind of magic and Princes of the universe <br />Unfortunately the other CD is a music CD and not a DVD<BR>which contains 3 tracks:<br />PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE, which can be found on Queens a kind of magic<BR>ONE YEAR OF LOVE  EXTENDED VERSION, that if you listen closely you can hear the edited segments, very disappointing. <BR>and FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS, which can also be found on Queens a kind of magic and Greatest Hits II.<br />Its a sham that Queen chooses to repeat and re-release songs that every one has heard before and when they do release some thing new, its just the tip of the iceberg of what these talented people have created over the years.<br />Heres a revolutionary idea: releasing all of there Video Clips on DVD, including: days of our lives, the miracles Scandal and all those evasive hot space clips such as back chat, body language and many, many, many more.<br />Please, Queen, I beg of you dont re-release we will rock you and \\"we are the champions\\" as an audio single again!!!
B0000668IF|4.0|i've noticed a lot of reviewers saying this cd is too much like 'play' and that they expect more from moby, since he's been known to really throw a curveball with some discs. having followed him since the 'everything is wrong' days, i have to say, when i put this disc in for the first time, it made me smile. it made me feel good from the first listen (it usually takes me longer). sure it has elements from play (particularly the soulful samples), but it brings together aspects of all his past music which i really like. it pulls a lot of the orchestral, cinematic, and piano types which i liked, particularly on 'everything is wrong.' this disc has a much more mellow, melancholic feel than 'play' did, but at the same time, makes me feel good. i'd almost consider it a more feminine version of the more masculine 'play.' if you like moby, you will like this cd. listen to the intricacies of it and you'll realize it definitely has its own moby flavor.
0060916540|5.0|Joe Simpson has the drive and heart of a lion.  I could not put the book down. I read it cover to cover.  An amazing account of someone pushing the limits!  The stark truth of the mental strenght needed for the sport of Mountaineering.<br />If you like to climb or are just interested, this book will give you some perspective on the extreme edges of this great sport.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This is truly f*&amp;%$in' brilliant.<br />With an ordainairy soundtrack you wouldn't expect much, a few songs, the usual, nothing like this. What's unique about the soundtrack is that it takes you inside the movie. The selection of songs, and the particular order, seems to me, to be rather symbollic.<br />Of course, David Bowie's magnificent redition of Nature Boy starts it off. But then, songs follow which take you inside the Moulin Rouge. Thrashing Rock, to Techno, to Pop, you're having a great time! <br />Then, we zoom out to the more generally ideas and themes of the movie. Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love, the tale of Satine and Christian's love, and on a sligtly depressing note, the jealosy and hate.<br />Beautiful in it's selection, you can listen to the whole album, the songs seem to link up so smoothly.<br />Wonderful!
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Finding Forrester is a great movie in which the writer tries to show how people are so easily misunderstood and judged before they are known.  Sean Connery plays a frustrated writer who never leaves his home and only publishes one novel that he has wrote.  Rob Brown plays an excellent role as a 16-year-old black kid from the Bronx who has a remarkable writing talent, as well as basketball skills.  The movie is about how these totally different, but more alike than they first realize, men find each other and change each others lives forever.  Finding Forrester is a sad movie but one that inspires us to dream and never doubt the power of friendship.
0062502174|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The narrative is very simple, told like a children's story, but it has some very deep meaning.  I've heard and read complaints saying that this book focuses too much on material wealth because the boy is seeking (and finds) his treasure.  Real treasure, diamonds, gold, and stuff.  However I found this appealing.  I was hoping the whole time I was reading it that there would be some tangible treasure at the end.  I hate those stories where at the end of the journey there's no gold but &quot;the treasure is inside of you&quot; or they obtain it and then it's taken away from them but it doesn't matter because they've found &quot;the real treasure in eachother.&quot;  That is so annoying.  The messages in those stories are made so blatantly obvious that I feel let down.  However here is a story that has numerous messages and insights which can apply to our lives, but it's still an entertaining and fantastic story.  <BR>The main character is the only constant character in the book.  He's very solitary and introspective.  Dreams and Destiny drive his life and because of that he fills his potential.  The other characters are very different and each teaches him a different lesson or helps him make a decision which aids him in his quest.  <BR>The writing is very poetic.  It is a very unique and artistic book which is very refreshing today when society and culture have generaly settled into stagnant creativity.  I'm ecstatic whenever something breaks the limited formula of modern storytelling.  This is such an occasion.
0790729652|5.0|this film transcends the cheap imitations done by its sequels. the acting is superb, especially by Mr. Jack Nicholson, who can't seem to do any wrong with any character he plays. and tim burton does a wonderful job in creating the dark world of Gotham City. also top notch is the score by Danny Elfman who set himself apart from other composers with this score.
B00003CXV4|4.0|Some people would call this movie far-fetched but, after living in California for awhile, I can say that there are people that would get together in the manner that Nelson and Sara do.  Nelson is intrigued by her and they seem to get together because they are so different than each other.  Charlize Theron plays the part perfectly - very believable.  Keanu was somewhat emotionless and did not pull off the part that well.  But the movie has important lessons regarding enjoying life's little pleasures.  Definitely one to add to the DVD library.  Also, the soundtrack is great.
6305342776|3.0|this film was done just to get money out of the star wars hype and it shows that not much planning in a creating a good script was there. i would put it in the camp status, but it really isnt campy enough to laugh at. it just isnt that good a film.
B000002GWN|4.0|Joni starts to get jazzy, reinterpreting her folk sounds as jazz pieces.  The band is great.  If you prefer her early folk cds, then you won't like the jazzy versions of those tunes.  I like the CD because it has great songs but sounds much different than the studio cds.  If it sounded just like her studio version of the songs than why buy it?
0780624890|5.0|i liked this film more than i thought i would. it was better than Interview with a Vampire because at least here they dont say that &quot;God doesnt exist.&quot; Sorry Antonio Banderas, but that was the wrong thing to say!
0704347121|5.0|Cleverly written. Excellent book. Enjoyable &amp; easy read. Highly recommend it.
B00004R9A4|5.0|this is a classic movie for kids. i used to like it when i was younger. recently i saw it again, and was pretty bored by it. i thought i would enjoy it through nostalgia and reminiscence, but i didnt. still, it is a great story and great movie for those with kids under 15.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Affirmation is a masterpiece, a true testament to the special ability of pop music to lift your spirit and let it fly. All the songs on this track are original and amazing in their own right. It's hard, but if I were to pick the best songs of the bunch, they would be the techno-like \\"The Best Thing,\\" mystical \\"Crash & Burn,\\" profound \\"Two Beds And A Coffee Machine,\\" and the overplayed radio hit \\"I Knew I Loved You.\\" Sometimes soul-searching other times just plain fun, the blend of musical magic Savage Garden has compiled in their last LP surpasses their debut effort. Indeed, this is a band that will surely be missed, so lets cherish every bit of this CD.
6305165912|5.0|did you guys know that this film has 259 f-words? hahaha! it is second on the all time list, behind only Pulp Fiction. if you dont like swearing, dont see this film. but if you wanna laugh a lot, the Big Lebowski is a hilarious film.
B000002JKA|5.0|Perhaps the best Metal record of 1994. Despite the tag forcibly(?) stamped on these guys, they don't fail to satisfy the metal heads who want the trademark bottom crunch from the low ends. Petrucci chugs like a freight train on &quot;The Mirror&quot; and &quot;Lie&quot;, numbing the listener with every onslaught. The rhythm section is ever tight and odd with the brilliant playing of Myung and Portnoy. Though the hit single &quot;Caught in a web&quot; is not as great as the rest of the tracks are, this album is certainly a landmark in the history of rock music. Blind melon...eat ur heart out!
0780623134|5.0|This is one of the best films ever made. It has one of the most powerful messages about hope. Frank Darabont does a masterful job of creating true suspense about what happened to Andy in the end. Morgan Freeman shows us his skills at acting as Red, the life-sentence prisoner, who knows he is in for the rest of his life, and is bored with telling his parole board that he really is repentant of his crime.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Filmed in 1922, the director F.W. Murnau set out to film an adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel Dracula. Although he couldn't get the rights to the novel, he pursued filming it anyway, changing the names of the characters and some of the plot points in the process. Stoker's widow sued the makers of Nosferatu for copyright infringement and won. All known prints of the film were destroyed as per the settlement. The German character actor Max Schreck played the vampire (now named Count Orlok) and was ready for international stardom. Since the film didn't make it to the theaters, fame eluded him in his lifetime.<br />Luckily years later, a print surfaced and the reputation of Nosferatu was restored. But why does it get such acclaim? A lot of viewers today find it old and dated, without the shocks and scares of modern gore-fests you currently see in the theaters and video stores. That's a shame because Nosferatu influenced a lot of those movies.<br />Modern viewers are more used to a \\"sexy\\" vampire. Since illicit sex is often the theme in vampire films, it makes more sense to be seduced by an attractive, exotic vampire. Count Orlok doesn't match that description in the least. He is repulsive-looking and resembles a rat.<br />And yet the underlying sex theme is still there. As it's pointed out on a DVD commentary, Count Orlok is the doppelgänger of Hutter, the male lead. Both vie for the attentions of Ellen. Though she is married to Hutter, she doesn't return his affections as strongly as he gives her. But to save the town, she gives herself freely to the vampire.<br />Of course, others see different themes in Nosferatu. Some view Count Orlok as a precursor to Hitler and the plague to Nazism, which would come a few years later. He even seems to give a Nazi salute as he dies.<br />And still others point out the many viewpoints through windows and the use of forbidding shots of nature, which show an influence of 19th century German painters like Caspar David Friedrich. Notto mention the equal influences of early 20th century German Expressionism with its use of stark shadows and unlit corners.<br />But you don't need to see any of that at first. You can enjoy it on its own merits as a very creepy horror film. One of my earliest memories of watching horror films was watching Nosferatu one October Saturday afternoon on TV. The scene where the vampire's shadow ascends the stairs on the way to his prey gave me nightmares for weeks and lingered in my memory until I saw it again twenty years later on video.<br />How ironic that Nosferatu is called A Symphony of Horror, when it's a silent film. But the audio tracks offered on the DVD from Image Entertainment do embellish the film well. Hitting the audio button on your DVD while the film plays will take you to your choice of three audio tracks recorded especially for this DVD. The first is a modern, quirky score by The Silent Orchestra. The second is a more traditional organ score by Timothy Howard. The third track is an illuminating commentary of the film by Lokke Heiss.<br />The goodies on the DVD don't stop there. The print itself has been remastered from high quality 35mm film and is restored to its original running time, as well as to its original color tints (although I think I preferred it in just black & white). A favorite feature of mine is the photo album of the locations used in Nosferatu as they appear in the film and how they look today.
B00000IREA|5.0|for the longest time i had only seen this film on TV. it had also been a favorite of my mom's as well. (my mom has interesting tastes in movies). so last christmas i bought this as a gift for her. only when i started watching it did i realize the nudity at the beginning with shock! and this movie is rated PG?!? haha! <br />a great camp classic!
B000002KLG|5.0|Once back in 1980, the time the album was released , a great diskjockey here in Holland (Ferry Maat's Soul Show) said, while playing &quot;Give Me The Night&quot;, in his broadcast show : &quot;The Night Is All Yours, George&quot;. And it was..... a big entry, and since that time I never forget this album. I think the time was right, Quincy Jones wrote in his story. George is one of those talents God created and gave us. An amazing talent which we'll never find it anywhere.
0790729628|5.0|this film goes along well with others by other masterful filmakers like Kubrick in questioning our society and morals. i just thought about this...i wonder, what would stanley kubrick have done with this story? obviously it's too late to see, but i am very impressed with Ridley Scott's interpretation of Philip Dick's short story \\"do androids dream of electric sheep?\\" it raises an interesting question, also posited by last year's A.I. about the value of an android's life. can it be held at the same level as that of a human's?
B0000668IF|5.0|Moby's \\"18\\" CD is a masterpiece of emotion and a fantasy of catharsis through an intergalactic world of spirituality.  The album is loaded with gospel vocals and moving melodies of hope, beauty, and love.  Some reviewers have trashed the album because \\"It doesn't *rock* like Play.\\"  Well, some albums \\"rock\\" very well and some achieve other moods very well also.  I find \\"18\\" to be Moby's best album to date, closely followed by \\"Everything is Wrong,\\" and \\"Play.\\"  Moby's commerical success on \\"Play\\" was unintentional and has brought him onto the forefront of an accidental mainstream audience that cannot sufficiently understand the artistry of his work.  My favorite tracks on the album are \\"We are All Made of Stars,\\"  \\"In My Heart,\\" \\"One of these Mornings,\\" \\"Extreme Ways,\\"  \\"Jam for the Ladies,\\" \\"18,\\" and \\"Rafters.\\"  It's inevitable that \\"Jam for the Ladies\\" will be a dance club sensation fresh for bootie wagging!  \\"One of these Mornings\\" features classic gospel vocals meshed with sweeping synths.  \\"Extreme Ways\\" is a post-modern Mick Jagger-ish vocal over a Pink Floyd mood.  \\"18\\" is a tear-jerking interlude of solitude and beauty.  \\"Rafters\\" is what a gospel disco would sound like!  I just can't write enough about what a wonderful piece of art work Moby has given us.  Moby is to be commended for blessing us with his gift.
B00004XMS0|3.0|BATMAN, the first film in this collection ROCKED! it was easily one of the better films of 1989 and showed a very gifted jack nicholson as the Joker. tim burton did a wonderful job with the first movie in setting the atitude and feel of the Batman world. the second movie just got too depressing, though very good actors were involved. after that, in Batman Forever and Batman And Robin, the scripts and acting just get simply ridiculous. i wish they never made those last two batman films. they really [are bad]. and if they continue in that direction, you will not see this fan at the theatre for the next film.
B0000640SB|4.0|The first half of MIB is damn funny.  Hyperbole is the key to humor here.  How can you not laugh at the possibilities presented by unlimited technology?  Will Smith is great as the man just smart enough but irregular enough to work as an MIB.  Tommy Lee Jones' panface is perfect for his role.<br /><br />The second half kind of devolved into regular, familiar action movie formula, and I started to get a little sleepy.  But the first 45 minutes to an hour is very, very unique and interesting.<br /><br />Worth checking out!<br /><br />-- JJ

B00005V0X5|1.0|MAYBE I CAN GET THE ORIGINAL RECORDING IN EXCHANGE AT THE PAWN SHOP! SORRY I DIDN'T PAY TO HEAR &quot;THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM TONE&quot; INSTEAD OF THESE BOOTS . AND THE SOUND IS NOT AS HARD AS THE ORIGINAL-THE VOCALS STAND OUT MORE --NOT MEGADETH'S STRONG POINT .I HAVE BEEN CHEATED!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has often been compared to, by many listeners and critics, as &quot;the next so and so&quot;--which is cliche in my opinion, being that for so long, when a new artist arrives with an ample amount of talent, they are so quick to be judged and in a way be compared to previous artists, that if the style that is found in their performance falls short of the &quot;original&quot; artist, we are quick to dismiss them all together--often never fully appreciating the newcomer or what they have to offer artistically.<br />In my opinion, the album is exciting and deserves the praise that it has received. I have not been listening to jazz for much over a year, but have bought several jazz albums--so in calling &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; a jazz only release would be incorrect. Miss Jones has a lovely voice, and though her range isn't that of spectacular, I enjoy it none the less.  I have reccomended this album to many, and will continue to do so--not only for the quality of her original work as well as her renditions (her rendition of &quot;come away with me&quot; is worth the price of the cd alone), but because in the &quot;pop&quot; infested, cliche world of similar music being hammered into our heads, Miss Jones is definitely refreshing, and I hope that the comparisons to Billie, Nina and others stop--for Norah is quite talented herself; indeed talented enough to not have the pressure of being judged against legends of the past--this is her first release after all.
B000002U82|1.0|Ever since I can remember Pink Floyd has been crammed down my throat as a vital band. Frankly, I can't understand why. To me they are just an over-rated pompous art band, whose songs try overly hard to \\"Epic,\\" in their scope but coming off sounding like the ravings of some depressed pseudo-intellectual who seems to think that life is just an illusion and the more chemicals you put in your body the better off you are. To be honest, no thanks, I don't want it and I don't believe in what they are singing about.     People have told me throughout my life that to really appreciate this album you have to alter you state of mind, \\"To get it.\\" My response is if you have to alter your state of mind to like something, then is it really any good? To me, that is like trying to fool your taste buds that spinach really taste good.     I understand now why when Pink Floyd tours they need every pyrotechnic /fx device at their disposal. If they did not have those devices they would put the audience too sleep.  Floyd needs the audience to have too be distracted by the fact that their songs all sound alike, and are just well, plain boring. Oh well, say thank you to classic rock radio for drumming the importance of this bloated form of music into the mass consciousness.   Yawn, it is sleepy time once again.  And, no I am not a troll.  As for my grammar I typed this once and left it.  Didn't think it was for college.  However I went back and made the necessary changes.  By the way all you school marms, did not tell me where I was wrong.  You know you have someone when all they can do is criticize your spelling and grammar.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is the album that once listened to and understood will silence all the people that didn't give Pac his due credit.  It is with this album that Pac's creativity was pushed to new boundries, like the track 'Me & My Girlfriend' where Pac describes his beloved Gun as his girlfriend in such a way that it leaves the listener confused as to what Tupac is refering to.  This album is off of the same block as his 3rd solo LP 'Me Against the World' which to some is his best.  'Makaveli: The 7 Day Theory' is very introspective yet more mature lyricaly and beatwise than 'Me Against the World' and takes Tupac to even higher heights than his nearest competition.  He shows himself to the fullest on this album unleashed fury and pain are in abundance tracks like 'Bomb First', 'Hail Mary','Life of an Outlaw' and 'Agaisnt all Odds' blatantly diss his enemies yet in a way unlike his B-Side classic 'Hit'em Up'.  Instead of just cursing and making fun of his enemies he shows his depth of thought by challenging them on a military type of hip hop quoting Sun Tzu on many occasions.  Tupacs big heart is felt on 'Krazy', 'White Manz World and my personal favorite 'Hold Ya Head' leaving the listener to finally understand Pac's thoughts and emotions towards life.  No 2Pac album is complete without his trademark playas club tracks and 'Toss It Up' is just that a playas club anthem!! also 'Just like Daddy' is a more sophisticated ladies track.  Any Hip Hop fan who does not dispise Tupac for revealing how weak and fake the BIG's, Nas's, Jay-Z's and Mob Deeps are of this world will acknowledge that this album is in the top 5 albums of all time along with 'All Eyez on Me' and 'Me Against the World'.  Buy this album NOW!!  Peace.
B000002UR7|5.0|Radiohead is a unique band that has an incredibly talented lead singer.  This albums showcases these qualities to a great extent.<br />It is also the debut of Radiohead.  Even though the big hit from the record is \\"Creep\\", it isn't the best song on the album, just my opinion.  \\"Anyone can play guitar\\" is the best song on this album.  I like all the music on this record. It's a good mix of mellow and rocking out music by one of the most talented bands to come out of the early 90's.<br />You must check out Radiohead live! I got the chance once.  They were masterful!  Amazing band!!!
B0000026J6|4.0|Here, there's none of the sweetness that sent you into diabetic shock on his earlier albums. Here, he's wry, dry, biting.  Lyrics are bizarro brilliant. The music is off-beat and hard to stop listening to. &quot;First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin&quot; is my favorite cut. You know how there's supposed to be anti-matter in the universe?  This is anti-Cohen.  It's odd how strikingly different these songs are from anything else he's ever done. I don't partiuclarly like his other CDs.  This one I love.
B000002UKS|5.0|Foo fighters arose from the ashes of nirvana and their first album contains heavy influences of the whole 'grunge' seen. Colour and the Shape helps to establish foo fighters as a band with more a matured sound. The songs on the album are great and are well written and contains a good mixture of heavier songs like monkey wrench and Hey Jhonny Park to something like See You.
0064409422|3.0|I started to read this book because the cover looked interesting. It is a picture of a faun hloding boxes in the snow with an umberella. This book is about four children named Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy going inside a wardrobe and finding a secret new world. They had adventurous times looking at sights, meeting new friends, and becoming kings and queens of Narnia. They also helped their faun friend defeat the wicked White Witch so their friends who lived in Narnia and Cair Paravel would live in peace. This book was excitng because it was their first trip to a different world.<BR>       The characters in the book are Susan, Edmund, Peter, Lucy, Aslan the lion, the wicked white witch, Mr. Beaver, and Mr. Tumnus. All of them are the four children's friends except the White witch. They all helped destroy the White witch because they were all kind and friendly. That;s is how she got destroyed. Since she makes snow and their loving and caring melted the snow into Spring.<BR>        My favorite part of the story is when Lucy is the first one to discover the new world and she got to meet new things and had a exciting trip. Her brothers and sister don't believe her until they go inside the wardrobe too.
B00003CXXO|5.0|This is an amazing film because it reveals why we, humans, should not play with artificial intelligence. To make robots that look like human beings to the point of being fooled completely by them is a rather easy task. But that robot is nothing but a machine as long as it does not have human feelings and first of all the capacity to love. The second drawback of such robots is that they do not grow or age. If you give the capacity to love to a child robot, he will be able to love but not to grow. He will remain a child forever though his love will grow more and more intense since it will feed on non-material energy. The genial element Steven Spielberg introduces in that story is a competition with a real boy and the subsequent disposing of the robot by the woman he calls his mother. He then attaches himself to fairy tales, to Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy who could change him into a real boy. That turn in the tale transforms the story that could have become over-sentimental into a magical and deeply ethical story. We discover what humanity would do as soon as such human robots existed. It would organize hunts to catch the stray ones, the abandoned ones, those chased by the police or any authority for crimes they had not committed but they had been made guilty of by the real criminals to save their own skins. The presence of these robots would cover up a new wave of crime that could go unpunished. So the human beings could organize some circus games with these robots as gladiators, but not gladiators who would die after a severe and honorable fight, but as sacrificial victims on the altar of the human dignity that is infringed by those robots. Shower them with acid, throw them through fire and through fans, hack them down with saws or all kinds of axes, etc. In front of that horrible fate, our boy and his gigolo of a partner on this trip will manage to escape due to a last breath of humanity in the audience of those games that will liberate them. And off they go to the big city of games, rides, casinos, brothels, music-halls and so many other attractions essentially performed by robots of all types. They are looking for the Blue Fairy. Then their trip will take them to underwater New York, the twin towers proudly dominating a sea of water. There David, our little robot, meets with his creator and escapes to the underwater world where he discovers the Blue Fairy of Coney Island where he is trapped by some accident and survives two thousand years of freezing which will bring the water down of course. That shows how absurd a project of producing robots who can feel and express sentiments is: these robots are bound to suffer at the hands of humans and many humans are bound to become cruel and sadistic, and to suffer in return, when confronted with the extreme demands in love and passion of these robots. But the film goes one step further and makes the story finally luminous. Extra-terrestrials arriving on earth and discovering the lost civilization of the earth completely wasted in the vastly human produced or amplified glaciation. These extra-terrestrials have powers that enable them to read the memory and the most subtle desires of David and to recreate the environment in which he met with maternal and filial love. But his demand to have his mother resurrected raises a question. When one has run one's time, if you revive or resurrect them then they are what they were at the end of their time, and that is dead because they cannot live beyond their time span. Then the story becomes full of sunshine. The young David will keep his desire and his demand, even though it will be entirely artificial and will only last from sunrise to sundown. And there maybe he will be a real boy when he goes to sleep with his mother who will go to sleep for ever. He will, so Steven Spielberg says, finally visit the world where dreams are born. Does it mean he will not wake up? Does it mean he will wake up but the recollection of this day with his mother will be the dream he needs to go on living, and maybe discover new forms of love or new people, even Extra Terrestrials, he could love? We don't know. Steven Spielberg ends his story on a sleeping boy going to dream and a sleeping mother going to eternal inexistence. Why on earth do we want to create robots that can feel sentiments when we have so many human beings around us we could love, which would improve our society and our world?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDill be the dream he needs to go on living, and maybe discover new forms of love or new people, even Extra Terrestrials, he could love?

B0000017CA|5.0|what genre is this? hard to say. few bands have ever been so versatile yet cohesive... they stitch together new orleans sludge, doom metal, grindcore, deathmetal, gothic and 70's stoner rock to an extremely great album. because of it's versatility i will review every song for it's own<br />1. the blue - starts slow and sludgy with a distorted riff, grinds through various tempo changes with great lyrics and cool vocal work from mastermind riggs. 10/10<BR>2. tranquilized - the most accesable song on the disc. mostly clean vox and catchy guitar work - without ever sounding flat 9/10<BR>3. cheap vodka - a short and in-the-face song, full of punky attitude and aggression 9/10<BR>4. fingerpaintings of the insane - incredible track, very hypnotic and downright disturbing. has some excellent distorted guitar which gives it its unique sound. very dark lyrics too 10/10<BR>5. jezebel - brutal. starts with a napalm-death style blastbeat. aggro guitarwork and brutal lyrics. 9/10<BR>6. screams of the butterfly - very melodic track and goth-tinged track. riggs has an incredible voice on here. strangely the violent and graphic lyrics fit nothing to the rather calm song<BR>7. dr. suess is dead - fantastic. starts slow and builds up to a killer chorus underlined through sawing guitar and double bass drums. 10/10<BR>8. dope fiend - cool track, although not quite as excellent as the rest. 8/10<BR>9. toubabo koomi - reminiscent of \\"cheap vodka\\" another punk-infused, fierce-as-hell mosher 9/10<BR>10. god machine - brilliant. the most death metal style track with spooky spoken word parts and brutal, shredding guitarwork and excellent drumming. lyrics are among the best i've ever heard. 10/10<BR>11. the mortician's flame - another outstanding track. very dark and heavy, with an incredibly goth-atmosphere. 10/10<BR>12. what color is death - a moshpit compatible, aggression fueled rocker. great instrumentation and structure. 9/10<BR>13. bones of the baby dolls - very mellow and depressing song, mainly acoustic but still excellent songwriting. 8/10<BR>14. cassie eats cockroaches - starts with a killer riff, brutal with various shifts and breaks. starts with cool samples from \\"a clockwork orange\\" and has menacing drums, making it sounding almost industrial-like. 10/10<br />altogether you got one of the best, yet most underrated metal albums of the 90's... HIGHLY recommended
0790749858|1.0|Michael Jordan has trod upon sacred ground by engaging in this blasphemously horrible movie.  In his seeming quest for the all-mighty dollar (and you thought he had enough!), he out-mongers even himself by participating in this... film.  The worst sin of this all is dragging the likes of Bugs Bunny down with him.  A piece of advice for the wary viewer: skip this film and tune in instead to some classic Looney Toons at home.

Her vocal performances in concert are nothing short of astounding.  If you like the songs on CD, you MUST see her live.  Words can't describe how incredible she is.
0804106304|5.0|This is probably my favorite novel right now. I'm chinese so I can understand the book better than some people. The book has a deep meaning and the stories are very close to real life back in world war 2. Well, it's similar to the stories that my grandma told me. I read this book with my heart and soul and nobody would understand what this book means to me! I highly recommend this book to everyone!
1884822312|5.0|When I first saw this book I knew that I had to have it.  It is the most beautiful chess book that I have ever seen (the worst probably being one of the ones with Lev Alburt and a beautiful model on them).  If nothing else buy this book because it will look really great on your shelf, and will impress your friends!  It is huge, and I really like how the side says CHESS in gold letters on the black background.  This is not the type of book you take with you on an airplane!<br />By besides my shallow opinions of how great the cover is, and judging the book on that alone, the inside is quite good also.  I enjoyed the puzzles a great deal.  If you have a choice between the softback and hardback, definetly pay a little more and get the hardback.  You won't regret it!
0804106304|5.0|I don't know if I write a review for this or not but anyways i loved this book. It's very real and deep. It's true that you won't be able to do anything important until you have read this book.
1558908323|3.0|As a subject, the portray of an underground world below major cities has always been appealing. Combine that idea with some giant killer bugs and you get \\"Mimic\\", Guillermo Del Toro's sci-fi extravaganza. This film makes an interesting approach on the nature of predators and the mystery of the dark corners of human civilization. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to satisfying the hard critical eye.<br />The movie tells a story about an army of genetically-altered insects created to destroy a plague of cockroaches in the sewers of New York. Three years later, the bugs have learned to survive by mimicking their worst enemies: humans. Now an entire colony of these creatures is growing under the Big Apple, and they're getting ready to move up.<br />As you can see, the idea for the plot is very good, and has an interesting edge to it, but in the end, the filmmakers decided to exploit it through simple action sequences, with a lot of \\"Aliens\\" on the back of their minds. Mira Sorvino is very good as the doctor who created the monsters and is now tortured by the idea of her creation being loose on the world. But her character is the only one with at least some depth in this whole story. All the others are just background people, who play basically three roles: \\"partners\\" for our main hero, \\"victims\\" that need to be rescued (children are perfect for this), and \\"meat\\", so we can witness the destructive power of the giant bugs.<br />The real problem with \\"Mimic\\" is that, even though it has a very original idea, the script suddenly decides to play it safe, since it gives you absolutely no surprises. By the end, you know exactly what's going to happen, basically the same thing that happens in \\"Aliens\\": you know that the good guys will find their way through the colony, find the source of all the creatures, and blow it up with the biggest explosion their budget can allow. Fortunately for us, at least it's a big budget (the design for the creatures is award-worthy).<br />The DVD itself is no good, unfortunately. It includes the theatrical trailer, but absolutely no bios or commentaries. Lack of features is a curse among DVD's, and I'll never get tired of saying it.<br />In conclusion, I recommend the movie because of its original idea and some cool special effects, but you're warned in advance that you won't find anything new once the story gets going. How they managed to pull off a sequel is still a mystery to me.D itself is no good, unfortunately. It includes the theatrical trailer, but absolutely no bios or commentaries.

B000065U1N|5.0|I thought this section was for reviewing the movie; maybe I'm confused.  Instead it looks like people are using this section to voice their politic views on war, hostilities, the military, etc.  <br />I hope the people who gave this movie a poor review at least read the book which provides much more background information than the movie.  If you didn't read the book before seeing the movie, I can understand if you had trouble follow the events taking place and their context.  However, I think a few of the reviewers didn't even watch the movie or read the book.  <br />I truely enjoyed the book and the movie.  I can't wait until it is released on DVD!  Yes, I will also purchase the Special Edition version when it is available.
B00005JKCF|2.0|There are a lot of reviews here that speak about how the movie stayed faithful to the comic book. I sadly beg to differ.<BR>Spider man never had webs oozing out from his anatomy, he had to sweat in his private lab to devise a gadget that would sling the web.The movie keeps dropping hints about Peter Parkers phenomenal scientific intellect but there is nothing in the moive that seems to point in that direction.The Green Goblin looks like a robotic contraption unlike the comic book. Also PETER DOES NOT GRADUATE WITH THE REST OF HIS CLASS. <BR>This is in no way a faithful comic book adaptation.<BR>This is a sugar sweet schmucky movie with bad dialogues , bad cgi and mediocre performances catering to the 8 year old bed wetting crowd.<BR>SNAP OUT OF IT.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I had to go see this movie with one of my younger relations.  First let me just say that the cartoon at the begining is outstanding, I have never seen a theater of adults laugh so loud.  <br />Then there was the movie this was basically a unique 250 million dollar PSA telling your children not to be afriad of the dark.  Or rather thats what it seems like on the surface.  I was very surpised to find myself laughing along with the rest of the kids.  <br />The only thing odd about this movie was that I didn't walk away with the same satisfied feeling that I had after Toy Story.  I don't know mabe it was the lenth of the movie or something.
B00005ALP6|4.0|There seems to be quite a bit of controversy about this one, particularly regarding the issue of Hepburn vs. Andrews.  I have admired the work of both these grand ladies for many years, and would rather not become embroiled in that particular argument.  I would, however, like to offer a compliment to the one actor who, in my opinion, stole the show:  the respected English music hall veteran Stanley Holloway.  His spirited portrayal of the imperturbable and totally unscrupulous Alfred P. Doolittle made this film special.  While I have to agree with some of the viewers that the film bogs down quite badly at times, Alfie keeps it interesting.  Mr. Holloway's performance alone is worth the price of admission.

6305784078|4.0|Until recently I had never seen THE ARISTOCATS. Even though the movie is a good movie for families, I have to admit that I wasn't really missing much. The movie is a classical Walt Disney (the man) film. The animation isn't much to look at nowadays, but when the film came out it was top notch. The story is rather simple and the film really doesn't have that memorable music. If you're a cat lover, you will probably love the movie. However, I'm a dog person and was really hoping Edgar would get away with his crime. I mean if I spent my entire life working as a Butler for a rich old lady and was promised to inherit some of her wealth only to find that I wouldn't get anything until the cats were dead, I would be pretty upset, too. A fun, but tame, film.
B0000214F0|5.0|There was no movie before or after that will come close to Caligula. This movie has balls! It went were no other movie has dared to go before..It tells the story of the emperor Caligula with all its depraved details,with an excellent tongue-in-cheek performance by the great and still largely underrated Malcolm Mc Dowell. Caligula was not only a genuine and very dangerous psycho! but a lunatic with a lot of power and a libido to match, and Malcolm Mc Dowell portrays this beautifully. Yet what makes Caligula a one off cinematic occurance is the sheer nerve of producer and Penthouse maestro Bob Guccione, by including hardcore porn in the film, as the legend goes after the mainstream actors and technicians went to bed!!And this combination adds a unique flavor to the film, it shows the decadence and depravity of romans, without being disgusting just maybe shocking and  real: in your face, porn.<BR>Many people have attacked the film as a piece of garbage,and the film became infamous for the wrong reasons, for I believe the filming, acting (Mc Dowell, O'Toole andf Mirren) and direction are above average. Watch Caligula as a unique experience in cinema, and even if you think it is a bad film, it is one of these films that are so bad they're actually good..very good in fact.<BR>but a Warning!!!! the DVD quality is very poor, similar if not worse than the VHS version..yet included is the making of documentary which is as interesting to watch as the film itself!<BR>go on indulge yourself in a bit of roman decadence, in the safety of your own home!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This isn't an album for the chin-stroking intellectual, subtlety isn't a word in Andrews vocabulary it would seem.  Its a return to the fist-pumping anthems of yesteryear, and I couldn't be more pleased.  This is the cure for noodling, alienation, and boredom.  It is headbanging music, it is the enemy for the elitists, its ultra-polished heavy metal with absolutely no apologies for being that way.  Its extraordinarily catchy, I put this on in the car, I get strange looks, but then we all headbang in unison, its wonderful.  So, for 30 minutes of power to cleanse yourself of your loneliness and despair or of a dose of Amnesiac, look no farther.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I have to wonder how this movie would have been treated by the late Stanley Kubrick -- it was to be his next project after EYES WIDE SHUT. Instead, A.I. was approached by the unquestionably talented Steven Spielberg. Unfortunately, the movie plays out like a strange fairy tale dream, including yet another -- and entirely overused -- reference to Pinocchio (recall CE3K?).  (How many times did they need to refer to the &quot;Blue Fairy&quot;?) <br />Overall, A.I. is all a bit too unsatifying and downright bizarre -- you'll know what I mean when you see the final 30 minutes, which will have you scratching your head. I got the feeling that this sequence was almost added as an afterthought. <br />Spielberg's fascination (dare I say obsession?) with the innocence and wonder of childhood is admirable, but only the first hour involving the family comes off as having any depth and warmth ... in fact, you almost forget that you're watching a futuristic sci-fi movie. The remainder of the film is chilly, surreal and somewhat cheesy sci-fi (e.g., the annoying &quot;Flesh Fair&quot; [a monster truck rally for the late 21st century? And we still got rednecks!], the ridiculous &quot;Dr. Know&quot; scene). There's definitely a lot of retread of BLADE RUNNER throughout. None of the side characters are well developed with the exception of Teddy, the mechanical teddy bear! Even Jude Law's &quot;mecha&quot; character seems out of place and almost unnecessary. There's never any real bonding between him and David after escaping the Flesh Fair. After peering into the lives of mecha David's family, we are swept away to Act II where things, quite frankly, take a turn for the worse. The storytelling is cold and distant (perhaps intentionally), and in the end, even the warmth, emotions and sentimentality seem artificial.
B00005MP58|5.0|While in the rental store, I chanced upon this movie.  I was surprised to find that I truely enjoyed it from beginning to end.  So much so, that I purchased this title for my movie library.  I've watched this move over thirty times, and each time I find some facial expression, or comment, that I'd not noticed before.  This movie wonderfully protrays the period, with it's overt and covert suggestions toward love.  I truly enjoy watching Colin Firth.  He protrayed Mr. Darsy like no one else ever has.  This, movie is highly recommended, and ranks within the top 10, as far as love stories go.  A+  for the BBC.

B00005YTFG|3.0|Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor star in a visually stunning retelling of the classic Moulin Rouge tale. Ewan stars as an aspiring playwright that has come to Paris to make a name for himself when a dazzling actress/prostitute (Kidman) catches his eye when he happens to wander into Moulin Rouge, a berlesque house in 19th century France. They have an affair that is not meant to be. While the film is visually attractive and new age, the content is very thin. I know most fanatics of the film would argue that content is not the prime focus of film's intent and is simply a work of art in motion, I do appreciate that, don't get me wrong. I can justify my rating.  For its overall appeal it is lower on a five point scale-a two, but for its artistic value, a five.  Thus the average is three. It is an \\"artsy\\" film, sorry for the label, but there is no other way to describe it. I recomend it to true fans of the story or someone interested in seeing theaterlike productions put to film. Traditional movie viewers, beware.
B000003TAW|3.0|Well first off Weezer arent half-bad. They are about average. Their s/t debut is the only album I own. Anyway the music is definitely derivative of the infinitely superior Pixies (who by the way influenced Nirvana, Radiohead and PJ Harvey among others) The album isnt a masterpiece. It wont leave you emotionally drained. It wont impact you on a variety of different levels. It wont change your world view or expectations of what music should be. But it is an enjoyable listen. My favorite songs off of it are:<br />1-The world has turned and left me here<BR>2-In the garage (any song that mentions Shadowcat cant be that bad)<br />And if you like this check out these superior albums:<BR>Pixies-Bossanova<BR>PJ Harvey- 4-track demos<BR>Radiohead- The Bends<br />Ultimately its a fun little album, that doesnt require much thinking and after too many listens will leave you hungry for something with more substance.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I am pleased with the many positive critics for this album and shocked by the negative. The fact is, that Leonard himself wanted this sound. Sharon Robinson only offered her demos and wanted to add real instruments and real strings. But Leonard insisted on this demo sound. You have to listen to the album several times, first the songs seem to be very similar. Later with a little patience you will be swept away by the beauty of the songs and the words. You don't care about the synthy sound anymore. LC is still a great poet but I am afraid his time as a composer is over. For me it is surprising how Mrs. Robinson found the right melodies for the lyrics. They are absolutely in the tradition and the feeling of Cohens latest CDs. I love all periods in Cohen's work but this new CD is an alltime favourite, I am never tired to listen to it.

B00005ASQ1|4.0|This is an excellent movie addressing overcoming racial issues, pursuing dreams, and the meaning of true friendship.  Jamal Wallace is offered a scholarship to a private college.  He loves to write, but the school does not realize that writing is the main reason he is there.  Basketball is his way to fit in, his acceptance; the school believes he's only there to play ball.  Jamal dares to make his dreams come true.  In this movie he shows his true devotion to friendship, dreams, and his own identity.  William Forrester, a famous author, is one of Jamal's inspirations.  This movie is somewhat different from other movies in that it seems like the real life of someone; it is slow at first, but begins pulling you in as the story builds.  This movie portrays the pressure of being an outstanding student; in Jamal's surroundings it is easier to blend in and be average.  I believe the director did a nice job of teaching lessons in the story line.  Some of these may include: <BR>         Pursue your dreams now, or you may wait too long.<BR>         Learn when it is best to be silent.<BR>         Friendship is one of the best gifts in life.<BR>         Believe in yourself even if others step in the way of<BR>              your dreams.<BR>This movie is inspirational, with unique characters that show how diversity makes life more interesting.  The actors portray their characters well, which aids the nicely flowing story.  Finding Forrester is a very original, imaginative, inspirational and educational movie.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is not a typical war movie - the archetypical characters, sappy superimposed love story, and clear moral absolutes are missing. It is real. It is messy, confusing, noisy, infuriating, dreadful, and awe-inspiring. The men portrayed sometimes act heroically, and sometimes screw up royally, occasionally managing both simultaneously. Despite the rating and knowledge of the violence portrayed, my 12-year-old daughter wanted to see this movie. She came away with a new appreciation for the U.S.Army. <BR>Ridley Scott is simply one of the most talented directors ever, and the only one who could have made this movie. <BR>Since the DVD is not yet available, I can't comment on it, but I'm hoping for some good features on how the filmmaker researched the actual historical events and people involved.

B00000I3JM|5.0|Percolating synths burble about the periphery, loosely held in check by vague beats and other synths that weave smooth, lush sonic tapestries, occasionally punctuated by slinky guttural bass, metallic clangs, and sharp staccato strings. Catchy melodies constructed obliquely out of random synth blips and synth washes, enhanced by bits of minimal guitar. Sometimes the bass is weird and slithery in a way vaguely reminiscent of Mick Karn. In fact, this makes me think of what Japan might have sounded like had they stuck around to make one more album before breaking up. Intelligent, sensitive-Scottish-guy singing ties it all together. This is \\"thinking man's\\" techno pop.  Abstract. Cool. Extremely atmospheric.     Some songs are more developed than others, like \\"Stay,\\" \\"Heatwave\\" (catchy chorus), and \\"Tinseltown.\\" Other songs take a more experimental route, incorporating random, slightly jarring clangs and buzzes, but nothing too over the top. This is, after all, an exercise in subtlety, understatement, and beauty, with a more sophisticated kind of tension lurking just beneath the surface. If you dig that early 80s, artsy, difficult-sensitive-guy stuff, you really need to check this out.
B00001MXWX|5.0|WARNING: Seriously biased opinion ahead.<br />Why?<br />Because I love the entire Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) series, and it would be nearly impossible for them to make a TNG movie that I did not like.<br />That being said, Star Trek: Insurrection is not for people who are not familiar with the TNG crew. This movie is filled with many references to the past which require, at the very least, some knowledge of the history of the characters. Even then, however, to fully enjoy this movie you must have an appreciation for all the characters and their history. Without it, most of the jokes in the movie fall flat.<br />For most TNG fans, this movie will be appreciated for the character development more than for the action. It does follow the pattern of the odd number Star Trek movies (this is the 9th one) not being as good or strong as the even numbered ones, but is still exteremly enjoyable.<br />If you are not a fan, start with the 7th movie (Star Trek: Generations) and work your way up to this movie.

I enjoy quite a few, though I can't say they are the majority of my record collection any more.<br />But, really, folks, there's a lot of bad stuff going on here.  Don't kid yourself about this not being &quot;mainstream&quot; music.  This is music pretty much designed for radio, a record slickly produced so that it might break on to Clear Channel lists everywhere.<br />First, sophomoric lyrics.  I find it hard to believe that these lyrics would ever appeal to anyone over the age of 25.  Lines like &quot;I just wanna be liked / I just wanna be funny,&quot; or &quot;I wanna run through the halls of my high school / I wanna scream at the top of my lungs / I just found out there's no such thing as the real world&quot; are as superficial as they sound.  Moreover, the song structures are aimless - check &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; for some seemingly random transitions between verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.  It really doesn't fit together well.<br />Furthermore, any cuteness the songs might have to redeem them is hidden under layers of production that don't highlight Mayer's talents - his smooth voice and good guitar work.  And there are too many songs on this album.<br />This is some of the poorest singer-songwriter music I've heard.  If you *really* are interested in non-mainstream artists who sing and write creatively and intelligently, there are many to be had: check out Julie Doiron (one of my new favorites), Rose Polenzani, even David Gray or Patty Griffin.  Or, go back to the roots of the folk-rock revival: Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell.  Or, go back to the music that inspired the folk-rock revival: Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Robert Johnson, or Leadbelly.<br />I hope that Mayer improves on his talents, and I hope that, if you really like his music, you'll try different music sometime.
0812550706|5.0|not being a lover of science fiction i didnt know what to make of this book when i first got it 10 years ago.  i love it completely and totally.  Its a terrfic commentary on children, war, and tolerance.  Read in conjunction with the supurb new &quot;enders shadow&quot; (same story told from differen POV) you will fall in love with Orson Scott Card's world
6305537321|5.0|I love this movie! But then I love Audrey Hepburn! (me and several million other people). \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" has one of the best beginnings and endings to a film I have ever seen, and what happens in-between is great too. Seeing it in widescreen on the DVD was a special treat, the picture was very sharp and colorful. Alot of talent went into this film, it has Henry Mancini's music, Blake Edward's direction, it's based on Truman Capote's novel, and has the acting talent's of Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Martin Balsam, John McGiver, Buddy Ebsen, Patricia Neal and Mickey Rooney. I actually like Mickey Rooney's performance, it's done in such a board and farcical way, I don't know how anyone could be offended by it.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|I really liked this movie very much. I recommend it for everyone. The actors were great!! It inspired me and it will inspire u. I am very glad I watched that movie because I was touched by the words and sayings that were said. And also because a author just doesnt inspire, a person can also inspire and author. It was interesting how one person can make a difference in their writing and how an author can change in just a matter of time. He was a very stubborn man and became very heart-felt and would help anyone he could. I really enjoyed this movie and I would watch it again!!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This film perfectly captures the pace of small town life in the Midwest; the old men who spend the last years of their lives sitting around the hardware store or the tavern, people who can make an afternoon's entertainment watching the volunteer fire department burn down an old house for a training exercise, who still say sir and ma'am and who wouldn't presume to make a long distance call on your phone without paying for it. I recognize these people. They aren't fancy pants Hollywood stars made up to look like midwesterners; they're genuine, the neighbors, aunts, and uncles that I grew up with.    The pace could be called slow, but to me it feels serene and peaceful. It's a calming balm after a day of fast-paced west coast life, like a trip back home to remind me of who I am.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice And Men, by John Steinbeck was a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. <br />I reed this book in the 9th grade, and I enjoyed it but now 4 years later I read it again and I understudied it better, maybe because I am more mature, and I understand life better than before.<br />I recommend this book because of how the two men, George and Lenny lock out for each other, and how good friends they are, but also it is a sad book, it is sad because of the way things tern out. This book has the best ending a book can have, the thing that a person will do for a friend.<br />I recommend this book to anyone, especially to people that enjoy books that make you think about things through out the whole book, and I also recommended to people that think that life is beautiful, but it can't be all the time.<br />        By, Victor Meza
0441172717|5.0|this is the best work in the dune series.  I love rereading this book, i loved the dune movie (yes the david lynch one!) and miniseries.  This is a great book if you are looking for a long scifi series
0553573403|4.0|this is a great book, but dont expect a happy ending. this book brings out all the bad things that happen in the world, which we would all rather ignor. martin shows that bad things do happen to good people, and sometimes we cant stp that. put shortly, if u want a happy up-lifting story, look elsewhere.<br />now that thats done with, i loved this book. it was excelent in its own unique way. although i found the format annoyong at times, i liked how u got to see different views with different charaters. the major problem with that of course, is that it took 100 pages just to get to a character i was remotly intrested in.<br />there were also long periods of time when i was soo bored... i was waiting for something intresting happen, and when nothing came i was disapointed.<br />like i said this isnt a happy book; any person with an inch of decency is either forced to live in horrible sercumstances, or dies. it sucks, but thats life. what u gonna do?<br />wether u like this book or not it will not be because of poor writing. martin does an excellent job at manipulating ur emotions and caring for, some, of his characters, and hating others.<br />all and all, a great book, but one that u should only read if u dont mind facing the harsh realities of exsistance. either way i loved it. enjoy
0517548232|4.0|It's been about six months since I last read Hazlitt's forcelfully argued little monster. The ideas in it, though, are never far from my mind. More accurately, every time I think about the current state of the political economy, I get the strong urge to buy it and ship it to a senator. Maybe they'll learn something!<br />Although it's title is misleading (not an economics intro, but a manifesto), Hazlitt's book explains in simple language the flaw in todays macro-economic thinking. Money can not be created when taking from source A only to give to source B. Source B only gains by source A's corresponding loss. Sounds simple, right. Then why are we convinced that tariffs, minimum wage, and the federal reserve (GASP!) are doing anything positive by operating on that theory. When we force the minimum wage up, all we are doing is shifting the burden to the consumer by upping what the employers products cost to make. As soon as the wages go up, so do prices. Once the prices are raised, that whole industrys prices go up (because they can) and everyone pays more INCLUDING the employees you thought you were helping. Hazlitt doesn't stop there, he gracefully applies the theory to a plethora of situations.<br />Although somewaht oversimplified (200+ pages) and certainly biased (free market) This book offers us a good theory, good argument and- suprisingly rare in econ texts- an overall enjoyable read. The only two real problems I see are: 1) As Hazlitts arguments all stem from this anti-distribution theory, the book gets repititious and you'll probably get the drift by page 120, and 2)At certain points, Hazlitt fails to distinguish between 'pecuniary wealth' and 'value wealth.' Wealth in dollars and wealth in utility are two different things. If we shift some money from source A (a dormant bank account) to source B (a compnay building a bridge to allow new commerce) Hazlitt argues that all we've really done is shift a static dollar amount. Of course the bridge when built willbring an escalation in commerce that will likely maximize it's use. While in the end, I think that Hazlitts argument, that money should not be forced into source B's hands by artificial distribution, Hazlitt doesn't pay enough attention to pecuniary v. real value. Still, this book is a great polemic, showing us why distribution tends to have the reverse effect. BUY I...if only so you can puke next time you watch the senate activities on C-SPAN.
B00005JXY3|4.0|This was a great installment in the series .  Though people whoe are not into Martial arts flicks might not appreciate it. The cinematography for the time was beautiful, and the score was wonderfull. <br />The acting was good enough  for this type of movie. Some people wanted the classic american sequel were everything is just a contiuation of the first but the movie mimics real life. Girlfriends come and go  and as Miyagi and daniel get closer  they learn more about each other, what with Certain Asian cultures being  a little withdrawn when it comes to showing emotion it is easily understandable why miyagi didnt mention his past life. <br />But if you go in expecting a ben hur  then you obviously didnt do your research and of course you will be dissapointed.  As a martial artist for over a decade i feel the movie did the best they could in two hours to show what would take years of understanding. <br />It is almost impossible to represent the martial arts on film without being boring or fake  . I  love jet li , jackie chan  ,  yuen wo ping and others but even bruce lee stated that the fighting he did on screen was not what he would do in real life .  <br />I think this movie hits the major aspects of martial arts training. Keeping your values  under pressure, standing up for yourself and continual self improvement  and if its a little cheesy  ..... hey it was the eighties.
B0000668IF|3.0|Moby was obviously under a lot of pressure while making this album and it shows. He is afraid to step away from the formula<BR>which worked so well with \\"Play\\". On \\"18\\" most songs a so simple<BR>that it becomes annoying. Most of the songs lack any interesting<BR>transitions. Sound is basically the same on most of the album: strings, piano and simple vocal hook. This is it. \\"Play\\" was great because it such an eclectic collection of things. \\"18\\" is a essentially a one trick pony. If Moby had a goal in mind of licencing all the tracks from \\"18\\", he will probably do it.<BR>While I was listening to \\"18\\", I was constantly thinking that each track can be used for one sort of commercial or another.<BR>But more often than not music in commercials does not win any awards for creativity. If you want to listen to a true innovative music save yourself 18$ and put Moby's \\"Play\\" into your CD player. It is way beter album.
0743424425|4.0|Another thrilling novel by Stephen king. The Shinning is a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a story about a man named Jack Torrance and his family Wendy and Danny. They just move to this town and Jack got a job at the Overlook Hotel. They have no idea what they have got themselves into.
B000063UR2|5.0|Ok I have already proclaimed this as one of the best films of the 1980's in earlier reviews so instead of repeating that I will review the DVD and it's features.<br />First off the directors cut is simply marvelous. The extra 25 minutes makes this film so much clearer and those who scoffed it the first time I think would enjoy this film much more. Extra dialogue between the characters clears some of the continuity gaps Ridley Scott and his team could not avoid when forced to edit it to 1.5 hours.<br />I have to say I enjoyed the Goldsmith score more with this cut than I did when I saw the original European version. Perhaps because this film is a much better edit whereas the Euro version had some very bad edits. The US version which, while shorter and had a different score, was still smoother than the Euro. I still prefer the Tangerine Dream score as a whole but I appreciate JG's music better this time around.<br />The extras on this DVD are a lot of fun. Especially the hour long documentary made in 2000, before the death of Billy Barty.<BR> They talk to Ridley, Mia Sara, Tim Curry, Alice Playton,Rob Bottin, Robert Picardo(yes that's right the holographic doctor from Voyager was in Legend, but I won't tell you who, watch the documentary!)the writer of Legend and just about everyone else except, not surpirisingly at all, Tom Cruise. I wasn't at all upset about that as I prefer all the other folks in this movie over him anyway.<br />There are a lot of great photos and trailers. They also have the deleted alternate begining sequence, the sound isn't great on this but it is still fun to watch. They have the original audio track of the Fairy Dance sequence with photo stills and storyboard artwork which is interesting and unfortunate that this scene is lost.<br />All in all this was well worth the wait and I am very happy that one of my all time favorites is finally here and in a much improved version!<br />\\"There can be no light without darkness.\\"
B00004XQ83|5.0|Well, what to say about this album.  This is the quintessential bluegrass album of our generation.  I saw the movie, \\"O Brother, Where art thou?\\" and I was immediately hooked to this fabulous soundtrack.  The movie was one of the funniest pictures that I had seen in years, and I believe that I saw it four times in one week.  By the end of that week, I was singing along to every song, even before I was able to purchase the album.  This is fabulous stuff... not just country, not just folk, but real-honest to goodness, bluegrass.  I dance around by myself to this music when I am by myself.  I sing it constantly.  I can honestly say that if there is one soundtrack out there that will stay with me for the rest of my life, it is the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" soundtrack.  <BR>My favorite tracks are the ones featuring Allison Kraus and/or Union Station.  Dan Tyminski does one heck of a job as the lead singer of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow.\\" (Who knew that George Clooney could lip sync that well?)  Allison Krauss is one fabulous singer--showing her talents, and making a convert out of me from my normal classical interests, in \\"Down by the River to Pray\\" and \\"Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby.\\"  Old time hits like \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" and \\"You are My Sunshine\\" are perfect as they are, and should not ever be re-done.  Gillian Welch is great, but doesn't hold me quite as much as Krauss.  The yodeling in \\"In the Jailhouse\\" is great... it will definately put you in a good mood.  The girls that sing \\"In the highways\\" are as flat as can be, but you can excuse it because it's so completely perfect in the context of the film.  \\"O Death\\" and \\"The Lonesome Valley\\" could have been omitted, in my opinion, but they do convey an important part of the story.  All in all, I can recommend this album to everyone... if you listen to it long enough, even the most anti-Country music listener will be converted.  <BR>So, next time you're in the Mississippi area, don't forget your Dapper Dan HairPomade, your copy of the Odyssey (makes the story so much more interesting if you know the background), and most importantly, don't leave this album behind...who knows, maybe you could be the next \\"Soggy Bottom Boy.\\"
0385503954|2.0|I found this book very disappointing considering its place on various bestseller lists.  It takes a very long time to get where it's going and the language does not warrant the wait; neither do the characters.  The &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; may be a fictional fad or may be here to stay but this one was a waste of my time.  And I really disliike books that contort themselves in the last few pages.
B000060P79|5.0|I was blown away by this new band! They sound Great! They're Mighty Good Looking too!  I Love this album and I encourage anyone who likes Punk Rock to buy this album and enjoy it!<BR>       Thanks for showing me this album Jessie!<BR>                 It Rocks and I love It!
0385503954|5.0|Having heard glowing reviews from so many sources before reading the book, I was a bit apprehensive.  So often I wind up being disappointed when things are &quot;built up&quot; and tend to enjoy things more that I expect not to like.  However, despite my high expecations, I was not disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed the novel.<br />As advertised, it is incredibly well written.  It also manages to flawlessly integrate temporally, geographically, and even thematically distinct characters and story lines.  I have not read much of Ian McEwan's earlier works (only Amsterdam, which I enjoyed, but which is not as good as Atonement in my opinion), but after reading this one, I would rank him as one of the few best contemporary authors.  Certainly this is one of the best books I have read in the past few years.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Rock Steady took me a few listens.. I was not sure what I thought at first, but was compelled to keep listening.  This mix of Rock-Ska-Pop-Techno soon took over my car and has now landed on my list of favorites.<BR>There is some of the 80's feel, i.e. Missing Persons -- done better.<BR>Sure it does not sound like the last album, but that is not a bad thing.  No Doubt has pulled off what most bands can't: Exploring new sounds, maintaining their integrity, and staying on top.  Madonna is the expert at this, but I am certain Gwen and crew are a close second.
1558216847|3.0|I want to believe but can't...<br />I first read this book about 25 years ago and have told many people about it.  It impressed me immensely.<br />I recently bought the 1997 version and still found it to be a thrilling story.  But there were questions in my mind that increase as I read these reviews.  (I was especially impressed by those of Rod Szasz - October 25, 2001 and Chris - February 9, 1999).<br />I like the suggestion about Peter Fleming (author of 'News From Tartary') as a source for this book.  My quick search on the Internet shows no record of Ronald Downing other than ghost writing this book.  Does anyone have any more info on Mr. Downing?<br />I have had no adventures as long or harrowing as shown in this book.  But I have hiked in Canadian Rockies, once sailed from Bali to Singapore and I took the train across Siberia in April 2000.  As a well travelled Canadian I know how difficult it is to walk in winter snow.<br />1. My biggest problem is the amazingly fast pace.  Certainly most healthy young military men can walk 4000 miles along a Canadian highway within a year when well-provisioned and well-equipped.  But to do that from Yakutsk to India is just too amazing.  If they had stopped for a few weeks in Mongolia, had learned some local lingo and found a couple of water containers before crossing the desert I might be a believer.  Or perhaps they might have spent time in Tibet learning local ways, getting local clothes and learning about the mountain routes to India.  They did none of this.<br />2. I have visited no place in Asia where there was not plenty of local watching eyes.  A group of fur-clad Russians would certainly be observed and commented upon any time they went near a village.  Other travellers make plain that there was plenty of beauraucracy in Tibet and Western China.  It is hard to believe that one could traverse such a distance in midst of WWII without meeting a single policeman, soldier or suspicious official.<br />3. Prison camp.  Arrived near death in early February 1941.  Within first two weeks they used axes and hand tools to build a group of immense 'eighty yard long' huts complete with bunks and stoves.  Within the next 8 weeks they had hatched plans, befriended Ushakov's wife, saved food, worked in the forest, learned to make \\"160 skis per day\\", organised an escape group and figured out a working escape plan.<br />4. What's with that radio?  Surely it was incredibly complicated.  The Commandant could fly his own plane but could not operate a shortwave receiver?!<br />5. There was a wall map of Siberia in the Commandant's house.  Certainly he could have studied it and sketched a route that avoided the worst of the Gobi and the worst of the Himalayas.<br />6. They miss cigarettes more than food or water.  Other traveller's tales tell us that starving people eat anything that might provide nourishment.  Ignoring the abundant snakes or the locusts for nourishment while starving is amazing.  Also no discussion on the possibility of canabilism?<br />7. I want to believe in Yeti.  But if it does exist it is not the size of Michael Jordan.  If it has survived so long in such adverse conditions it must be some kind of much smaller and much less conspicuous beast.<br />8.  Finally -- and perhaps most important -- is the utter lack of any documentation.  Surely there must be something in Indian / British records.  This group must have made a huge impression when they arrived in the hands of the British army.  It should be easy to find a British service record putting Slavomir in India.  I find it strange that he tells names and details on all his companions that came from behind the 1956 Iron Curtain; but of Mr. Smith he knew neither name, hometown, or any other traceable details.<br />To bad.  It is a great story.  I wish that I could believe.  I will have to re-read some of my other favourite 'true' adventure tales with a discerning ear.
B00005JKYS|5.0|This movie is just simply the best movie I have seen on Vietnam. As a veteran of that campaign I can guarantee all viewers that it accurately depicts all the conditions that we faced. The battle scenes were so realistic it bought back many bad dreams. The acting was also just great. Mel Gibson was never better, and Sam Elliott was just amazing as usual. A genuine 5 star film which will be eagerly added to my DVD collection when released.
B00005JKYS|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS VERY VERY GOOD.

6303369170|5.0|Arizona Dream is a very very beautiful movie. When I saw it first time I was crying from happiness. I finaly saw a movie so pure human so much like the way life sometimes is.<BR>There is not a bit of fakiness. It is the same way very complicated to understand as our own lifes. Because who doesn't see his life like a mystery? Real Sherock Holmes. Isn't it? <BR>    You can realy feel actors believe in what they're playing. Johnny Depp looks like a person not just an actor.<BR>And also completely different than in all his other movies. More sincere or I would say open. Ye I think open is the right word.<BR>And Emir Kusturica I love the way he let his mind just go. Camera makes it so poetic <BR>Staff like this I could write all day. <BR>The movie is about real people without  scouples of society (that's why somebody call the charecters eccentric)<BR> Since I saw this movie, I'm just thinking about vacation in Arizona.<BR>I would highly recommended to people who like to wonder throughout their lives.
B000002ADT|5.0|while my other reviews are a bit longer winded, the following encapsulates everything there is to say about this recording:<BR>KIND OF BLUE IS UNAMBIGUOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MUSICAL RECORDING OF THE 20TH CENTURY. 'nuff said!
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is pure fun.  It is the story of two outlaws, Butch Cassidy and his partner, Sundance.  Butch is kind of wild and is always coming up with schemes to make some quick money.  Sundance is his partner and the quickest draw around.  Together, they are a dynamic and unpredictable pair that are a lot of fun to watch.<br />Before long, Butch and Sundance discover easy money in robbing banks.  After robbing many banks, they become legendary fugitives from the law.  They are wanted by the law in many states and they continue to strike at will, emptying the banks of all of their cash.  Before long, the law begins to catch up with the pair and they are forced to flee to South America to avoid prosecution.<br />In South America, Butch and Sundance regain their old form and continue to rob banks.  They also become famous in South America known as \\"Bandidos Yaknees.\\"  In a moment of luck, the law stumbles upon the pair and a gunfight erupts as Butch and Sundance duck for cover.  While being raked with bullets, Butch and Sundance discuss their options and ultimately go down the same way they came on the scene, with guns blazing.<br />This is a fun movie for the whole family and I would recommend it for any avid movie fan.  It is the product of the old-time Hollywood era, movies are just not made like this anymore.
B000001FDQ|5.0|The first time, I had my hands on this album was 1985, I was in grad 9. The first impression I had back then, something like, \\"How many people are playing guitars here?\\" Due to my ignorance in guitar instruments, I thought that least ten people were playing guitars simultaneously in this album; I thought \\"No one man can do this by himself.\\"<BR>17 years have gone by, this funny memory not only makes me laugh today, but also it has become a part of my life.<BR>Before, I die, if someone to ask me what brings me a happiness in my life, then I will say, \\"my guitar, and few other things(I don't need to specify, because those are not related to this review).\\"<BR>I have never met Yngwie, but I must say,\\"All my gratitude is yours\\". My long journey with guitar embarked with this album. I'm still in that journey. So, if someone to ask me, \\"Is it reminiscence or reality?\\", then I know what the answer is.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|It is so easy in hindsight to vilify Leni Riefenstahl for making one of the most powerful and influential films of all time. After all, there is little doubt she was a genius in her field and the fact that she lent her talents to the Nazi Party to make this great propoganda film frightens us to no end. How could such an artistic genius serve pure evil, we ask. Well, what of the world that applauded \\"Triumph of the Will\\" in 1934? What of the French who gave this movie their highest honors and awards in 1935? And what of all the articles and reviews in England and in this country which tripped over themselves in praise and admiration for this film in 1934 and 1935? If Leni Riefenstahl is guilty of serving evil, so, too, is the rest of the world which paid this film incredible homage when it first appeared.          <BR> <BR>   This is a breath-taking film! The direction, techniques and editing are truly remarkable.That Riefenstahl was way ahead of her time is not in question. The question is whether or not the times have yet to catch up to her genius as a film-maker.<br />    Moral certainty was a rare commodity when it came to National Socialism in the early and mid l930's. Admiration for Hitler was globally more common than we'd care to admit these days. Diplomats and journalists all over the world were praising Germany's economic recovery under Hitler's leadership. At the time when Leni Riefenstahl accepted the commission to film a Nazi rally in Nurenberg, Hitler had yet to expose the evil he would soon unleash upon the world.<br />    I am not an apologist for Riefenstahl. However,she never made another film for the Nazi Party after l934 and for that we should all be thankful. We should be thankful because had this woman chosen to serve the Nazis into the late 1930's and early l940's, those films would have served Hitler as well as any weapon system. If \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is Riefenstahl being non-political, one shudders to think what she would have created on celluloid were she a true believer.<br />    Riefenstahl frightens us with her talent. Her manipulation of the audience makes Hitchcock seem like an amatuer. Her techniques, lighting, editing and camera angles make \\"Citizen Kane\\" just another run-of-the-mill movie. And her ability to seduce the viewer is unparrelled. See \\"Triumph of the Will\\" and get a glimpse of a rare talent and a genius at work. And then be grateful that she stopped making movies when she did.

078322804X|5.0|This is how I remember Chicago before it became a truly world-class city. Today, this movie, on this scale, could never again be made in Chicago. I remember when it was made: the whole city was shut down and people were amazed that Hollywood had come to our town.  This is the last great American film musical, featuring of course, the blues of Chicago which are Delta Blues spiced with twangy guitar riffs. The movie's transformation onto DVD is nothing short of a triumph of technology. The music is now more than ever before an integral part of the movie. Where else can you get Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and countless other soul and blues stars all together in one place? And have the music coming at you like they were all in your living room. Belushi was a comic genius. Clearly out of control, mad. Ackroyd's antics and stage presence seeped and played off of Belushi. He was too bright a star; too fast for his own good. But he left us with this film, a true American Classic.
B000063UR2|3.0|I have been always intrigued by this movie, on one hand it still remains one of the most visually bold fantasy films ever made, the director's cut is about 30 minutes longer than the US theatrical release, there is more character development, not much though. The problem with this movie is one that keeps it from being greatis that it isnt really endearing, the characters are cold and we really don't feel for them. I have always thought that Tom Cruise was misscast as Jack, and I still feel that way, this type of role does not suit him, he doesn't look right in the role. He doesn't ruin the movie in any way but, he offers nothing to it either. I wish that the tone would have been a little lighter and fun, it is a dark movie, which is fine but it would have been nice if the movie would have been more all around fun. Of course Tim Curry as Darkness is the best part of the movie!(though I STILL think that the horns could have been smaller!)In the director's cut, we do not actually see him until the movie's final 40 minutes, earlier we see only his hand and we hear his voice. When he finally appears it has a greater impact than in the US version where we see him right away. So I find that Legend is improved in the director's cut, but even though I admire the film I find it hard to really love it!
B00005YW4H|3.0|After listening to this first offering,for a couple of weeks,from the potentially talented Ms Jones,I am left bemused and ultimately unfulfilled!The talent is there,she addresses jazz,blues and country styles,she sounds ,or attempts to sound like just about ever female vocalist influence she has ever heard.This Cd suffers ultimately from this willingness to mix everything together.<br />She has a husky whisper to a sweet velvet like delivery,at times she attempts the Lucinda Williams,and then to me goes for that Memphis soul that has me thinking Shelby Lynne,from her first offering.Unfortunately,when the listener is getting a fix on her style,it changes.<br />The songs do have a sameness,except for the delightful*Dont Know Why*and the stretch*Come Away With Me*,*Shoot The Moon*,*Turn Me On* and *Lonestar*.Real promise is evident,that belies her age and the fact that this is her first effort.<br />If you want to relax and play this in moments of comtemplation ..and lets be frank,dont we all have those!!!...this is great,but if you want something a little bit more challenging,this is not what you are looking for.<br />The aforementioned songs did show her ability and had a smooth and infectious groove,and her vocals were indeed pleasing.<br />The difficulty here is too many people are trying to compare her to just about everybody from Billie Holiday to Diana Krall..which to be honest is not fair.I liked this CD for just being a pleasant well crafted debut offering from a woman who can sing a little play a little and has the confidence to attempt to sing what she wanted.It is not a treasure,not the future of music..and the voice and the piano playing are nothing  out of the ordinary...but there is something there that would warrant some future consideration.<br />A little less cocktail of styles please,focus on some blues/R&B that reflect that sweet voice..and maybe a hint of that country that is trying to get out.Keep up the good work Ms Jones!!<br />3.5 stars
B00005K3O4|4.0|The first time I saw this movie was many many years back in the 5th grade.  My friends and I were avid horror/sci-fi fans as well as comedy fans, and one weekend \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" was one of our choices to rent.  This movie satisfied every sort of wish and desire that we wanted in a movie: it was sick (blood suckers), comedic (a large man saying to a small klown \\"What are you gonna do?  Knock my block off?\\" and the klown proceeds to do just that), and the cinematography was awful (which only adds to the loveliness of the movie).  If you haven't seen this movie yet, put the Cheez-its down, and go rent it, or better yet, go buy it.  If you've seen it and didn't like it...well, you've got problems.  If you've seen it and love it, come on over, we're all packing under the big tent and we're gonna watch it until DVDs are out-dated.
0805053883|5.0|The art is wonderful. After reading this book a few times we finger painted and cut out the paper when it was dry. We cut out circles and squares and then glued them on paper and told our own story. I love being able to take a book and do activities that jump off of the book pages. My almost three year old son does too.<br />The story is simple and fun. The repetitive nature of this book makes it great for pre readers. With a little bit of practice your child can memorize the book to 'read' it to others. What an ego boost.<br />I like the last page with all the kids acting out the parts of the animals. One day I will make some masks with my son....<br />enjoy.
B00000JCB2|4.0|...<br />This album is worthy because of \\"Nobody Like You\\". I like KoRn and STP a lot, but that's not why I like it. It's a more melodic tune on the album. It's also interesting. It wasn't played bad either. It's probably my favorite Bizkit song of all-time.<br />Other standouts here include the melodic \\"Just Like This\\", which, despite being a bit generic, has the chorus which helps it. \\"Re-Arranged\\" is the second-best song here. It has a good pace, and it works. I also really like \\"No Sex\\", which features Aaron Lewis. Like \\"Rearranged\\", it's got a good pace. It's pretty melodic, also.<br />Aside those four standouts, I'm not so crazy about the rest. \\"Nookie\\" has a good tune, but it's overshadowed by it's dumb lyrics. It would make a good instrumental tune, though. This is probably the best bass tune of the album. \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" I guess is in the mediocre side, though not my cup of tea. Track 9 has has a good background and is also average.<br />If you like Limp Bizkit, I don't see why you wouldn't like this. This is the proof that I'm not a complete hater. I honestly do think that \\"Break Stuff\\" sounds like a joke, but it's not \\"Hot Dog\\"....
0440217563|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the continuing adventures of Claire and Jamie.  They managed to find just as many problems and scrapes to get into as they did in the first two books, and it was always interesting to read about how they'd get themselves out of trouble.  But it could be shorter if not so many pages were devoted to repeated and detailed descriptions of every little thing.  Also, the majority of chapter 61 - the weird fireside voodoo ceremony of the slaves - could have been left out.  It really didn't have much to do with the story and wasn't very interesting.  All in all though, it was a pretty good book.
B0000214F0|1.0|Never before have I seen such bad acting by such great actors in what could have been a great epic.  Malcolm McDowell and Peter O'Toole completely disappointed me in this poorly written and poorly directed screenplay.  In an attempt to portray, in explicit scenes, the decadence of Rome during the rule of Caligula, the producers and directors turned this film into nothing less than a big-budget, ... fiasco.  If you enjoy stupidity at its best in a movie, this is the one for you.
B000066AXE|3.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is about a mathematical genius who suffers from schizophrenia.  The first third or so of the movie, we are given no knowledge of this and we believe the hallucinations he has are true.  The movie spans over his lifetime from college to old age, starting around the 1940's or so.  With a doctoral degree from Princeton, he receives an important job with the government trying to break codes from the Russians to discover where \\"the bomb\\" is.  I kind of felt like he must have after this first third or so of the movie because I wondered what parts of it were real and which were only in his mind.  His wife stands by him despite his disease, which must have taken extraordinary love on her part.  The movie didn't communicate this love very eloquently, like why she loved him so much.  It doesn't explain to us what his ground-breaking theories were or what work it was the he really did, apart from the hallucination that he was breaking codes for his Top Secret mission.  The whole movie is pretty well summed up in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize.  As a mathematician, he explains that his career has taken him to the very ends of logic and he kind of stigmatizes it saying that it was the love of his wife that was most vital to him and his career.
B000002ITK|3.0|I know that TS was generally embarrased by both the quality and the sales performance of their last two albums (\\"Come Out And Play\\" and \\"Love Is For Suckers\\") and therefore chose not to have them represented on this compilation, but there were at least three tracks worthy for inclusion - \\"Leader Of The Pack\\", \\"Be Chrool To Your Scuel\\" and \\"Hot Love\\".  Yeah, \\"Leader Of The Pack\\" is kinda cheesy (watch their \\"Behind The Music\\" episode to see how well that song is regarded by those associated with the band), but wasn't Twisted Sister pretty cheesy to begin with?  And isn't that what we loved about them?  I mean, any of those three songs would've definitely fit better here than the pathetic live tracks at the end of this disc.  Their version of the Stones' \\"It's Only Rock & Roll (But I Like It)\\" may be the worst cover version ever recorded.  <br />As it is, this record pretends that Twisted Sister ceased to exist after 1984, which is sad.  Still, if all you know is \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\", there's some hidden gems here.  \\"The Kids Are Back\\" is my all-time favorite TS song, and \\"Shoot 'Em Down\\", \\"I'll Never Grow Up Now\\", \\"The Price\\", \\"You Can't Stop Rock & Roll\\" and \\"I Am (I'm Me)\\" are all classic as well.
B000002I25|5.0|Already immersed in the disease of alcoholism at the age of 23, Jim Morrison provides us with a catbird's seat of his own self-destruction. The Doors as a band were incredibly unique and gifted, but no one has captured the train wreck as existance that is addiction better than \\"The Lizard King\\". <br />    <br />     The pursuit of danger is captured perfectly on \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"Take It As It Comes.\\" The surreal escapism of drug abuse is explained in \\"The Crystal Ship\\" and  \\"End Of The Night.\\" The final destination of this progressive disease  finishes up the album (\\"The End\\").<br />     To find a artist who honestly performed as a means of exorcisng his own demons, to keep from slitting his throat or jumping out the nearest window, has a certain integrity to it in today's world of corporate rock. The music of the Dors stands on its own merits, but I can't help but believe that, with drug addictions of all kinds on the rise,  its lyrics speak to more people today than they did in 1967. Easily one of the top 5 best rock albums ever produced!
0060392886|1.0|If you can't judge a book by it's cover,then this is the exception. Better title: Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse.Nothing different here from other rock clones, except the year 2002 brings us true raunch.The only surprising thing about this book is how ANYONE from front to back ends up without a fatal STD.Steaing clothes from a homeless chick- real class,dudes. Without a doubt,self hate exudes from the literary authors(The Crud),and every individual,most especially,the women-associated with these narcisstic juvenile delinquents. Licking the flames of hair spray & fire is good practice.There is a fire that will burn forever.....
B00003CX5P|2.0|The most famous phase in a Star Wars movie is &quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot; and its made by Obi-Wan (Ewan McGreggor) and i can't decide if he's talking about the movie itself, or the annoying Jar Jar Binks.<br />  Great DVD, so-so movie.
B00004Z459|5.0|I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IN WORDS. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE SONGS. TO ME HYBRID THEORY HAS A SPECIAL FEELING THAT DRAWS YOU IN TO IT AND WON'T LET GO.
B000002KO3|5.0|One of the most hypnotic albums in rock.  Like Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks,\\" \\"RIL\\" is that timeless classic that didn't sell a bundle, but still remains insanely influential.  Also like \\"Astral Weeks,\\" this album requires MULTIPLE listens to fully grasp all it has to offer.  If you hear it and don't go ga-ga at first, have patience.  Repeated listens to this album, which is STILL ahead of its time, are mandatory.  Your life will certainly be richer for the exeperience!!
B0000024WN|5.0|What struck me about Pearl upon listening to it again recently, is the authenticity of the music. Some reviewer once claimed that rock merely gets stale whereas pop music rots with time. There is nothing stale about Joplin and her band on this all-time classic. After all these years, it remains a magnificent listening experience because of the quality of the songs, the band's tight playing and the impressive emotional range of Joplin's vocals. Unlike on Cheap Thrills, where there was mostly a cosmic battle between her voice and Big Brother's heavy metal onslaught, here the voice is the star. My favorites on an album of classics include the incredible Me and Bobby McGee, the tender A Woman Left Lonely, the nervous Half Moon, the emotional Cry Baby, the buoyant Get It While You Can and the plaintive/humorous Mercedes Benz. Perfect arrangements, brilliant playing and masterly vocalization combine here to create a timeless masterpiece.
B0000256VK|5.0|Along with Van Morrison's &quot;Moondance,&quot; this is the most romantic album in rock.  Part of the hipster groove laid down here is thanks to master drummer Andy Newmark.  When he slips into position on the intro to &quot;More Than This,&quot; the magic begins.  Every song here is filled with romantic longing, from the obvious hits (&quot;Avalon,&quot; &quot;Take A Chance With Me&quot;) to the unknown gems (&quot;True to Life,&quot; &quot;To Turn You On&quot;).  Ferry tried to capture some of this magic on &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; (and succeeded on &quot;Slave to Love&quot;), but in music, the whole is almost always greater than the sum of its parts.  Still sounds fresh 20 years later, so raise your hip quotient and get this beauty.
0140072187|5.0|Back in the late 80's, Robert Mason's \\"Chickenhawk\\" appeared on bookshelves.  Mason's personal story of a helicopter pilot in Vietnam was the first of it's kind  and has since spawned a number of personal helicopter stories, and they all owe the market being opened by Robert Mason.  I was still in high-school when the book out and I wanted very much to fly helicopters for the US Army at the time.  After reading this book I was not sure what to do, I was scared at the thought of being shot down  in battle, but also saw the pride in what the helicopters pilots had done in Vietnam.  This was also the first book I recommended to my father to read, a two tour veteran of Vietnam himself.  I have gone back and reread \\"Chickenhawk\\" at least 4 times over the years and it still holds up so well, and I still feel like someone hit me in the stomach everytime I get to the end and read those last few lines.
B000002GHH|5.0|Like others, I first came to this album after reading so many glowing reviews of it.  For once, the critics were dead on the money.  This album contains some of the most moving ballads you will EVER hear.  &quot;Lipstick Sunset,&quot; with its tear-inducing slide solo by the immortal Ry Cooder, is masterful, while &quot;Tip of My Tongue&quot; is one of the best songs I've ever heard about the end of a relationship (and there are certainly lots of THOSE to choose from!).  Hiatt's recovery from alcoholism provides other high points, such as &quot;Have a Little Faith in Me,&quot; Stood Up&quot; and the transcendent album closer, &quot;Learning How to Love You.&quot;  It's staggering to think how many master songs are on this one album, but that's the buyer's gain.  If there were any justice in this world, this album would have been a smash of infinite proportions.  What has this album sold in 15 years, maybe 200,000?  Don't get me started, just make sure you own this album!
6302000823|5.0|To start with, the story more than chronicles the various rites<BR>of passage a boy goes through en route to adulthood.  The image<BR>of the camera as an omnicient eye is heavily symbolic - it is<BR>the father who died too early for the child to remember, but it<BR>is also the child's guardian angel, the one who eventually moulds <BR>his character, his decisions, and his future.  There are many<BR>different ways of making a film, and many different kinds of<BR>cameras, and the boy learns all about the film industry, not<BR>realizing that his own life is comparable to a film.  He develops <BR>and refines his own way of looking at the world and interpreting<BR>the things in it, at the same time playing a participant's role<BR>in that same world.  We actually learn more about him by looking<BR>through the other end of the lens, so to speak.  At one point in<BR>the film, he does that himself by reviewing old material and<BR>revisiting old shooting locations.  He experiences it as an odd<BR>yet familiar journey into the known, yet unknown, world he left<BR>behind.<br />I would recommend this film not just for film-devotees in<BR>general, but also for those who are not embarrassed when faced<BR>with the opportunity to reminisce about the past, who do not<BR>mind surrendering to a graceful mood of nostalgia, and who do<BR>not flinch from reviewing their past with the objectivity of an<BR>all-seeing, all-revealing camera
B000002LRX|5.0|Absolutely, THE most underrated album of the 90's!  As a follow-up to \\"The Real Thing,\\" it was a commercial disappointment (I don't know why), but an artistic milestone.  It's one of those albums you listen to and then try to get everyone you know to do the same.  Never will you hear so many musical styles coexisting and enhancing each other.  Take the opener \\"Land of Sunshine:\\"  you have a slamming funk track interspersed with Mike Patton's operatic bellowing - and it works!  Each song has some pleasant little surprise just waiting for you (and often many surprises).  \\"RV\\" is certainly the best song ever written about trailer trash (\\"...getting stupider.\\") \\"Midlife Crisis\\" and \\"A Small Victory\\" should have been major hits in a perfect world, and \\"Everything's Ruined\\" is simply mindblowing in its inventiveness.  Every track is aurally fascinating and make for one of the most adventurous listens in music history.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Certainly a \\"must have\\" for Ann Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins fans. A wonderful job of bringing the correspondence format of the book to the screen. I was quite disappointed however to find that 1/3 of the cinematographer's efforts have been electronically clipped off each side of the picture in the DVD version. To add to the insult, the result is called \\"full screen.\\" I certainly wouldn't buy a condensed version of the book and cannot understand why anyone would want an \\"edited for TV version of a great movie.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Genius high school nerd Peter Parker hasn't felt the same, since that genetically engineered spider bit him during a field trip.  He's stronger, faster, more resilient, and he shoots webs out of his wrists, climbing skyscraper walls with the greatest of ease.<br />By the time he's started college, Peter's learned some hard lessons in life.  His family is torn by tragedy, and his fantasy girl-next-door love, Mary Jane Watson, is going out with his best friend Harry Osborn.  Harry's defense contractor father, Norman, is more like a surrogate father to Peter than a genuine father to his own son.  But, unbeknownst to anyone  -  including himself  -  Norman Osborn suffers an even worse tragedy than any Peter has endured...one that will turn him into the scourge of New York City and Peter Parker's arch-nemesis.<br />This fabulous action-adventure film version of the famous Stan Lee Marvel comic book character suffers only from too much underplaying of the title character by Tobey Maguire, and not enough chemistry between him and co-star Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  Maguire is credible and likeable as Peter, he just doesn't have much fire until he's got the Spider-suit on.  The rest of the cast are fine, some even superb  -  for a single example, Cliff Robertson is wonderful in the small but important support role of Peter's Uncle Ben.  The special effects and the pacing are uneven, but overall better than not  -  director Sam Raimi is an experienced hand at this kind of movie, and keeps it moving pretty well.<br />But the highest marks go to Willem Defoe, as the tortured Norman Osborn.  Defoe's Osborn not only gets to chew the scenery as the wicked Green Goblin, but simultaneously (and convincingly) also plays the Goblin's first frightened victim  -  himself.  The mechanical-looking costume and props of the Goblin are really incredible, and fortunately are very well-matched by those of Spider-Man, himself.<br />Not a perfect movie, but a damn good one.  Enjoy.<br />By the way, the novelization of this film is really terrific  -  check it out.

B00005OAIE|1.0|Okay I've been hearing people talk about this guy and his great music, and now I've heard some of it... well, he needs to be vomited upon. Whatever happened to rockin' and rollin'. La-Dee-Da is what this is. He needs a slot on the Lawrence Welk show.
B00005NKCM|5.0|Upstairs Downstairs is an immensely absorbing soap-opera set in the declining decades of the British Empire. The original producers expent much effort on historical detail, regional accents, and such things, and the acting is superb. Really, it's a joy to have these episodes on tap in DVD form. But the Arts and &amp; Entertainment Television Network did very little work past transfering these shows to disk - there are no subtitles or chapter divisions, so you might as well be watching them on VCR.
B000003S09|5.0|what can i say! this is music...Robert Fripp is God among musicians. King Crimson!.i was a yong boy, when i discover this KING of KINGS Band and this album was my first  great listening experience  in rock music, ITCOCK changed my life and interests in music.
B00000K0EA|5.0|I've never met anyone that didn't like a James Bond film.  They may be out there, but so what.  Pierce Brosnan is a good Bond.  He plays the roll as a tough guy.  Megalomaniac publisher wants to take over the world by creating the news instead of just reporting the news.  He even uses the news to try to start a war, but of course, James finds a way to stop him.  The great scene for me was using GPS to take the British Navy off course into Chinese waters, and yet the Navy is sure they are still in international waters.  It's a very good use of technology in a film.  My only complaint about this film is that I wish Teri Hatcher had more time on film.  Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Bonds counterpart.  Good action and great stunts as usual.  Buy this film if you're a Bond collector.
0452282152|5.0|This was the best book I have read in years.  I can't explain why I was so caught up in this story.  I'm certainly not an authority on art, but the author was able to make me feel the soul of the artist.  The understanding between Vermeer and Griet was so solid, so real, so lovely.  Trying to look at this book from 21st century standards is ridiculous (one of the reviewers called her &quot;snotty&quot; because she didn't like the blood on the hands of Pieter the son). Griet was an artist also, Vermeer recognized this.  A perfect book to savor.
B00003CX97|5.0|This is a great, classic film.  The setting is a World War II prison camp somewhere in the jungle.  Hot, sticky, and yucky.  The prisoners are required to build a bridge.  The prisoners do what they can to keep the bridge from being built, until one day, when a British Colonel whose spent too much time in the sun shows up as a prisoner.  He actually designs and builds a great bridge.  It's a good film about the struggle of and against human nature.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Someone please explain to me how it is that in a film which is supposed to take place in 1900 Paris everybody is speaking in English and singing Nirvana songs. Maybe I just don't 'get' it. Or maybe its that I have recently seen Marcel Carne's 1946 'Children of Paradise', and although shot in black and white, 'Moulin Rouge'- with all its color and flair, pales in comparison.
B000065U1N|2.0|When I flicked on my TV during sometime of the summer of 2001, I saw what looked to me as the most worthwhile looking movies of the year; Black Hawk Down. Pending its release, such comments were made as, \\"Much better than Gladiator!\\" \\"The best war movie ever made!\\" and the such. Of course, with reviews like that, who could have not seen it?<BR>Well anyways, my friend and I went to go see it on opening day. We piled ourselves into the theater along with a bunch of other action craving guys and sat down. Throughout the movie, I felt destracted by the allour of my popcorn more than what was up on the screen. I thought it was overly violent, mediocore acting, but, I must say, good action. Action alone cannot save a bad movie, so sadly I must decree that Black Hawk Down recieves two stars.
B00005JKBC|4.0|In my opinion, this is the best movie directed by Tony Scott since &quot;The Hunger&quot;.  And that's great because the projects he made with Jerry Bruckheimer were below average.  &quot;Spy Game&quot; also marks the return of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt after &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, in which Redford directed Pitt.<br />&quot;Spy Game&quot; tells the story of a retiring CIA agent (Redford) who trains a rookie (Pitt) in the art of espionage.  The relation between the two is the strongest point in the movie because, as a teacher myself, I felt attracted to the fact that a mentor cannot turn his back on his proteg&eacute;, no matter what the circumstances are.  All the way from Washington, D.C., Redford has to make plans to rescue Pitt, who is captured and detained in a Chinese prison while trying to rescue a mysterious pacifist woman (&quot;Braveheart&quot;'s Catherine MacCormack). It's a very good story.<br />The extras on this DVD are interesting, especially the fact that you can watch behind-the-scenes facts while watching the film by pressing the ENTER button on your DVD remote control whenever the CIA symbol appears on screen.  The deleted scenes offer nothing new, except one where Redford is seen on a private conversation with MacCormack showing they know each other, some moments before she is seen with Pitt in a bar in Beirut.  So if you want to watch a good espionage movie, this is your ticket.
B000060P79|5.0|I'm not a total hardcore rocker chic but I DO know a good group when I see one!!  This band is totally great and all their songs are really good! If you're a fan of Blink-182 or any other bands like them, then you'll really like Simple Plan...they're not huge yet, but they're definitely on their way!!
B0000640RX|5.0|Ok, so the Rambo trilogy isnt a big brain bustin' adventure. They were not meant to be. Who cares. This box set is the first  DVD collection i've purchased. The box was neat. Metal, with an embossed Stallone being his usual killing machine. The inside was handsome, but i was shocked. Two sided DVD's, what a nuance. Not one, but two sides to avoid getting finger prints and scratches on. I only watch the widescreen versions, so i guess its not a big deal for me, but still, this shouldnt be this way. Dual layer, please. All the bonus features were pretty cool, I guess, and it possessed a surprising moving documentary on Vietnam, although I believe that this was included to be somewhat politically correct. Don't let the box fool you, half the bonus features on the 4th disc are just like extended trailers of the three movies. However, these are my only complaints, rambo looks great on wide screen. This is 80s action at its finest.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I really liked this movie. Lots of times it is labelled as a \\"gay\\" movie, giving lots of people false ideas about what it really is and they don't see it. No, my friend, on the contrary. This is a punk rock musical. Don't expect Tim Curry to molest Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick because it really is NOT \\"in the irreverent tradition of Rocky Horror\\" as the back of the box says. The viewer really grows to love Hedwig from his journey as man, to woman, to rock sensation. It's awesome. <br />Also, a great DVD. New Line is becoming my favorite studio because it is giving great independent movies great DVD treatments, not just the movie with nothing else like a lot of other studios do. It's nice to see a great transfer, deleted scenes, RUNNING AUDIO COMMENTARY, a 90 minute documentary, and Dolby 5.1 AND DTS sound. <br />When all is said and done, it's a brilliant film considering this is Mitchell's first time directing. He gives a great performance and also wrote it. Stephen Trask's music is great, the lyrics are insightful. Rent or buy this movie, it's not the gay movie you've been led to believe it is.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones breathes a little fresh air into a stagnant music scene.  This WAS a pleasant surprise.  <br />She is a singer/pianist with quite an unusual, sweetly raspy voice.  You who whine that an artist's selections all sound alike will find it hard to say that about Come Away with Me.  The tunes range from standards to country to unusual but are always interesting and evocative.<br />...
B000002MZ9|2.0|I have been a Neil Young fan for years. I love the Neil of old but this was [bad]! Teaming up with the band Toe Jam was a mistake. Almost every song here has been done before and better by Young himself. The songs are not a pleasure to listen to, in fact, they are annoying to no end. Where is the originality?
B000059H98|5.0|Tank Girl is fabulous, as long as you go in wanting to see a comedy film full of cheap thrills, killer props, and a super wardrobe. The evil-bad guy with the \\"Water and Power\\" company is a relatively uninteresting villan, which makes the conflict rather one-sided. Lori Petty makes a perfect Tank Girl, a bold and daring heroine, with her mad-stylin' tank that matches her look perfectlly.<br />While the plot isn't entirely original either, it doesn't really matter. The props and outfits, plus entertaining dialouge makes up for it entirely. I also loved how it sticks to its comic-roots and uses comic panels intermitely to add extra flair.<br />This movie rules. period.
0618001905|5.0|This book is one of the most carefully researched popular works on African history. Contrary to what some cursory reviewers have written, Hochshild approached the subject by reference to original primary sources -- letters, diaries, original manuscripts of Belgian officials and numerous others who were at the heart of this shameful period. The list of references at the end of the book lays out the depth of his research. Need I say more in defense of the author -- the Belgian Prime Minister, recently apologized for his country's nefarious role in Congo. Another example of the author's objectivity is how he describes the personality of some anti-Leopold activists such as Williams, pointing out their frailties just as much as Leopold's himself. He also points out the preexisting practices among African tribes which were also reprehensible by modern standards. There is no hidden agenda in this book -- what Leopold did in Congo was ghastly, and this book should not be dismissed as \\"political correctness\\" -- it is the clear and verifiable truth. Specially in this day and age where we feel emboldened to refer to despotic regimes as \\"evil\\", we should feel quite confortable in referring to Leopold's reign of terror as \\"evil.\\" Furthermore, this period was even more ghastly because it was carried out through direct deception of many well-meaning European and American philanthropists, who were given to believe that enterprise was being carried out for humanitarian reasons. Yes, this exposition should not be used as a means for perpetuating tensions between the colonized and the colonizers. We should indeed move on, but reconciliation is only possible when there is an unequivocal acknowledgement of past injustices, which this book provides with adequate objectivity. We must remember that objectivity does not preclude culpability -- with adequate evidence, it is the academic and moral duty of all analysts to acknowledge the culpability of certain players in a conflict. In this case, the burden of blame clearly rests with Leopold's regime, as described through their own words and deeds, and as documented admirably by the author.se, the burden of blame clearly rests with Leopold's regime, as described through their own words and deeds, and as documented admirably by the author.
B00004UEIF|5.0|For trained ears, this 20 bit K2 remastered version sounds significantly better than the conventional less expensive version. But the price difference is more than justified, if you are a devoted Bill Evans fan who wants to get as close as possible to the real performance on stage that magical Sunday afternoon. Nonetheless, I cannot help but listen to this CD with genuine respect and apprecaition to the musicians but also with disdain to the audience at the club. They were so lucky beyond any stretch of imagination to be there but (at least, some of them) kept on chatting with occasional laughter during the performance. This may be an indication that Bill Evans was still taken lightly as a budding musician in those early days of Bill's career. If you want more, Bill's \\"The Complete Riverside Recordings\\" will give you a chance to expose to the entire show in the sequence of each tune as originally played.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|Finding Forrester is a great movie. This movie teaches young adults how to embrace life and take whatever hits you. In Finding Forrester, 16 yr. old Jamal, goes to a private school called Mailor Callow; the best school on the east coast. But before leaving, Jamal and his buddies place a bet. This bet lands Jamal into a friendship with a special person, thats lasts forever. When this movie was made, the director was thinking of how to attract young adults in writing and where it can possibly get them in life. Finding Forrester is a movie made mainly for younger adults going through high school/college. The characters in this movie were very believable, because this movie shows what could actually happen to people all over the world. None of it is really fantasy at all. Every character in this movie did any excellent job. I don't think anyone could have done a better job. The moods and emotions in Finding Forrester are very subtle and calm. At times, the characters get a little emotional or excited, like during the basketball game or when Jamal's special friend reads the writings that Jamal wrote himself. The director also did an excellent job with this movie and also with the cast. He couldn't have chosen anyone better than what he had. I think the major theme of this movie is &quot;live with what you have, it may be the only thing left in your life.&quot; I request this movie for you and i'm sure you will enjoy it!
0694003611|5.0|My daughter clamored for this book when she was little.  She is 3 now and I got her \\"My World\\" for Christmas this past year.  It has also become a favorite.  If you like Margaret Wise Brown's work, you have to get Runaway Bunny!!  Its another favorite in our house!
B000063UR2|5.0|Just as I suspected...Ridley Scott is a director whose work I have always admired. He's a director whose passion for the art of film making and story telling is dominated by his creative spirit and senses. Yet, there was always something restraining or constricting him from going through with what his visionary gut and artistic heart would tell him i.e. Harrison Ford's dead-cold narrative in Bladerunner and of course the U.S. chopped up release of Legend.It's always those who hold the pot of gold that tell the artist what he or she can and cannot do;unless of course the artist is another Lucas or Spielberg ! Then Scott  directed Gladiator giving him the upperhand this time in deciding what to do with his film !<br />I thoroughly enjoyed both versions with both alternate soundtrack scores. The Tangerine Dream version adds a mythical and almost spiritual new-age mystical feel (though the soundtrack by today's standards does sound a little dated due to the synth-new wave pop music of the 80's).The Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music)music video brings back memories of my teen years during the 80's! The video will probably make some viewers giggle remembering the funny styles the early and mid 80's MTV pop stars would wear.Yet, the song Is Your Love Strong Enough is anything but laughable; it's very memorable with it's serious melancholy soft rock sound. However, the Jerry Goldsmith version gives the film a more John Williams or even a Disney epic-like nuance which replaces the new age mysticism with something more organic and robust!<br />The dvd transfer is spectacular without any major characteristics of artificial color saturation or macro blocking mpeg digital artifacts that a lot of releases of older films suffer from. Colors are vibrant yet not bleeding. The dvd version has an overall genuine film quality about it.In addition, it does not look outdated. No one can look at this and say, &quot;Oh yeah, it looks like an 80's fantasy film&quot;.It's visually timeless. The DTS and Dolby (though only in 2.0 stereo)tracks will thrill the aural senses with the rich bass (listen to Darkness like never before)and realistic dispersion of special effects !<br />The acting abilities by  a much younger Cruise, beautuiful Sara, and ego-maniacal Curry are superb and truly feel genuine...Ditto for the actors behind the painstakingly detailed make up effects.<br />Once viewers see the director's full length version it will definitley over shadow the cut up and choppy edited U.S. 90 minute release. <br />After years of waiting for this dvd Ridley Scott has truly given us a legend !
B00005YXZH|4.0|&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is my first experience with Wilco.  After reading all the positive press, I just had to see what all the fuss was about...now I see.<br />The word &quot;honesty&quot; is the first word that comes to mind when recalling this album.  The guys just lay it down, period.  Simple chord structures and innovative yet familiar melodies compliment eachother nicely here.  The songs vary from light, barely-strummed dirges to happy little rocking numbers.  The album is just a nice little change of pace from the norm...dig it.<br />Vocally, Wilco brings to mind Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips...thin, just barely in tune, not trying too hard...very direct.  Musically, I get Radiohead, Gomez, Flaming Lips, maybe even classic Beck.  Sit back and relish the melody.
0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six is about a secret multinational task force set up to combat terrorism around the world. The team's code name is Rainbow (which describes their multinational composition) and their leader is an ex-Navy Seal by the name of John Clark, also known as Rainbow Six.<BR> The book starts by seizing your attention with an exciting plane hijacking, and coincidentally, some of the team members were on board to handle the situation with great professionalism. Just as the team is settling into its new base in London, they get called up to stop a bank robbery in Switzerland. An attempted kidnapping is the next plan they have to foil. And to top things off for the team, they have to face a group of terrorists that have kidnapped a large group of children and are threatening to kill them one at a time unless their demands are met.<BR> Their next assignment will be a challenge so great that most people wouldn't have even thought someone would do such a thing. They must take on a group of people so extreme in their ideologies that... well, you'll just have to read the book yourself to find out what happens. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKEC|5.0|\\"Training Day\\" is a raw, streety flick that packs nearly non-stop action over the course of its two hour length. It also has Denzel Washington playing a villain and he does so very convincingly.<br />Up until this film, most of Washington's roles were as good-guy as Tom Selleck's fare...and Denzel Washington has the good looks and charm to pull off all those good guy roles. Here he's hard edged and viscious as a cop who's crossed over the line.<br />Washington is Alonzo Harris, the training officer to Jake (Ethan Hawke) a rookie entering the Narcotics Unit of the L.A.P.D. Ethan Hawke is excellent as the naive recruit who gets an extremely harsh dose of reality.<br />The story is down and dirty and the characters are not only sharply defined but vividly real as well. The story is as brutal as a train wreck and just as gripping. You just can't help but rubberneck.<br />I saw this in the theater and was glad that Washington got the Oscar for this role. He was excellent in Malcolm X, but that was a character he didn't have to invent. Lee followed Alex Haley's biography in every detail and Washington had reels of archive film of Malcolm X to work off of. Denzel Washington had to invent Alonzo Harris and he did so with a powerful and penetrating realism.<br />Like \\"L.A. Confidential\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction\\" this is a great story that's translated extremely well on film. If you haven't seen it, by all means check it out. If you already have, then you already know it's a keeper.
B000062Y98|3.0|Are we all talking about the same album? Night at the Opera I mean?? OK, it's not bad and it surely has it's moments, but it's definitely not the best thing BG has done so far. Many songs sound as feeble attempts to capture their former majesty but alas, they fail. Gone are the powerful but smoothly flowing songs instead you have some chaotic, weak arrangements, it's a miracle if you can keep your concentration alive. Old BG songs made you dream, this one makes you bored and tired. I hereby declare it as the &quot;Disappointment of the Year&quot;. Let me remind you anyway, we are talking about BG here and 3 or 4 tracks alone are worth your money(especially the last track, maybe the best since &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;) but I was expecting so much more.Let's just hope that this is Mid-Career Crisis.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Leonard Cohen is a master poet. That fact stands out on this CD. His observations are insightful: &quot;do not choose a coward's explanation/that hides behind/the cause and the effect;&quot; &quot;And the dealer wants you thinking/That it's either black or white/Thank G-d it's not that simple/In My Secret Life.&quot; Each song contains pearls of wisdom that stick with you and provide insight to life's struggles. The lyrics, combined with the vocal harmonies, make this album an exquisite one. Unlike a previous reviewer, I find Sharon Robinson's voice a complement to Cohen's; together their voices help make the point that meaning is in the sorrowful and the joy, and our job is to &quot;go to the window, drink it in.&quot; Music for the soul, advice for life.
B00005UEAR|2.0|I will not buy any other DT album unless the &quot;vocalist&quot; leaves the band for good. This LP is a circus show.That's all.If you are determined to listen to it anyway, try to listen to it in karaoke, so that you can avoid the vocals. Good for practising musician. Go get &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; and forget this one.
0385503954|4.0|I have great respect for writers who use words in interesting ways, to paint pictures and tell stories from a unique perspective. Ian McEwan is a master, and I enjoyed Atonement although it did drag a bit. I have also found another writer whose words intrigue me. Were Robert Frost or Claude Monet to employ pen or brush to craft an epic love story, Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin would be the creation. Martin's lyrical prose fuses the drama of The Bridges of Madison County with the emotional weight of The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. McEwan and Martin provide a fine complement, McEwan dealing with heavier material while Martin soars.
B000001FY9|5.0|Once in a while an artist comes along to define his musical genre, but none have done it with so much grace as Bob Marley. His lyrics are full of intelligence and hope, his music joy and triumph; never have songs been so elegantly articulated. I'll spare you any further entreaty, just know that your life will be a mere shadow of what it could be without his music.
B000001TVD|5.0|This slab's way more \\"adelic\\" than it is \\"funk\\", for those of you who hear \\"Flash Light\\" and \\"Tear the Roof Off the Sucker\\" bludgeoned into mediocrity by black radio, then nod confidently when the over-aged pothead in the Phish T at your local Tower asks if you \\"know George Clinton's stuff\\". Especially for its first ten minutes, after which you come home to find that the great ivory museum of established guitar gods in your know-it-all little head has been thoroughly ransacked and spray-bombed a distinctive shade of BROWN. That's the Jimi-licious title track, ten SECONDS of which paints you as a soulless bastard sired from corporate America's unlubricated sodomy of the music industry, who probably worries that keeping a flag on his SUV's antenna is sending hordes of quickie-mart owners to the shrink's couch with an inferiority complex, if you don't feel it in THE MARROW OF YOUR BONES that this is indisputably one of the most harrowing, most point-of-view-transforming, and (yes) most emotional instances of electric guitar ecstasy ever captured on tape. Eddie Hazel, mournful mind misty with maggotrocious memories of his majorly missed mum, takes that guitar and births both the acid-boiled stepchild of Coltrane's \\"My Favorite Things\\" and the blue-eyed son Hendrix never had, all over the studio floor in one long, painful, meandering squirt, slipping on the plasma in the process and just writhing in it. Rolling in it. Stewing in its putrid juices and crying out to his mom floating through the heavens, as it soaks through his clothes and into his skin, penetrating his heart and starting the whole tortuous process all over again. Everything else here's a smoking bowl of fried-funk/guitar-god/racial-and-socio-political/mumbo-jumbo gumbo, to varying degrees of spiciness. But only \\"Back In Our Minds\\" gets routinely dumped down my sink after one spoonful.<br />Maybe this disc SHOULD be kept out of the mainstream, due to the spinal damage it's caused to a generation of pasty-faced college kids, whose vertebrae have literally snapped in their body's confusion between air-guitar and the \\"funky chicken\\". Nevertheless, take the risk, or clip on your tie and go back to your little 6x6 cubicle at work, to send out office-wide memos about someone leaving paper towels on the floor of the men's bathroom. You can still pat yourself on the back for being a real free-thinking individual. Just make sure you avoid all mirrors.
B00005O5CM|4.0|When I first heard of the movie, LEGALLY BLONDE, I suspected a ditzy teen movie with not much of acting, plot, or significance. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got a chance to watch the movie. The beginning starts out silly...the expected takes place when Elle Woods (Witherspoon) and her ditzy high school graduate friends are thinking about boyfriends, makeup, their perfect dresses, etc. However, the movie keeps you watching as you see the changes that come along with Elle and her story. Here is a quick plot summary and a telling of what makes LEGALLY BLONDE &quot;not just another blonde girl flick&quot;.<br />Plot: Elle Woods is the perfect girl. She has pretty much everything a teen girl could desire...great boyfriend, plenty of friends, and beautiful clothes. Then everything takes a turn for the worse...or so she thinks when her boyfriend dumps her during a date. The reason is because &quot;Elle isn't smart enough for him to impress his family when he goes to Harvard&quot;. Elle, devasted, does all she can to head to law school. <br />The plot takes twists, plenty of comedic moments, and the characters take turns for the better...and the worse. Elle begins also to unexpectantly discover the person she really is behind the &quot;Barbie Doll&quot; look. It also holds valuable lessons about acheiveing goals and not letting anything stop you. This movie could be compared to Alicia Silverstone's CLUELESS. While both excellent, funny, not-just-another-teen-movie movies, I'd recommend LEGALLY BLONDE over CLUELESS. In both movies, the characters began as shallow, ditzy teens and later on in the plot became more aware of the world around them.
B000063UR2|4.0|This DVD is a must have for people who likes LOTR and Willow. I honestly think that the Tangerine Dream score was much better because it has better melodies and gave the movie a different feeling. The only thing I'm dissapointed is that the U.S. version didn't come with 5.1 channels. I like the other version as well, but it seems like the Jerry Goldsmith score seem out of place in some scenes. They should've added the cutted scenes to the U.S. version with the Tangerine Dream score.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|I like Iowa, but this is the best disk ever released by slipknot!I would definately reccomend this-it has tons of bonus tracks including a live version of surfacing which is on their video &quot;welcome to my neighborhood&quot;. And it still has the secret track that the regular cd has on it(if you didnt hear it, listen to the live version of surfacing, and let it play until around 8 min. and youll find it). This is definately a must if your a metal fan.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Look, will you all just accept that this is one of the greatest American albums of the last few years and be done with it? Over here we can't get enough of it! <br />There really is no debate here, this is a great album. What more do you want than this? It's short and sweet (no hour long slog here), it has a superb collection of just the great pop tunes around (how many hooks and cool licks can one band cram into a song), it's really well produced (okay, so it sounds like The Velvet Underground a little, so what? Would you rather it sounds like Limp-Alien-Ant-Papa-Staind-Puddle with BIG LOUD guitars and SWEEPING EPIC production on it?) and the band are just damn cool (not a shaved head, tattoo or awful base-ball cap in sight - yeeeeees!).
B00005R2M3|2.0|There are two good songs on this.  The two popular ones of course.  The rest i did not like at all.  If you're only looking for those two get the CD.  If you're looking for that and more dont bother.  I know she can do better, but she decided to only do two good songs and the rest aren't worth the skimpy shirts she wears.
B00004XQ83|3.0|Yes, there's some great music here on this overly hyped, overly publicized album.  But the lead-in song (?), the 4 minute chain gang chant, Po Lazarus, is a waste and five versions (including the instrumentals) of Man of Constant Sorrow is way too much.  This is one of my favorite genres of music, call it roots, Americana, bluegrass, country, string band, whatever - but I would recommend getting the real deal although you might want to use this album as a sampler.  As for some of the artists that appear here, there are outstanding albums by Norman Blake, Gillian Welch, Alison Krauss, John Hartford, etc.  Other seminal artists well worth seeking out are The Delmore Brothers, Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers and The Carter Family.  Or how 'bout some of Woody Guthrie's early recordings with Cisco Houston?
B00000G42T|5.0|While this compilation was a contract obligation for Michael, Sony had the rights to these songs and to release any compilations they wanted to, this is still a worthwhile investment for the George Michael fans. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: THE BEST OF GEORGE MICHAEL spans his career with plenty of material to satisfy the fans. The set is divided by 2 cds, the first being FOR THE HEART (ballads) and the second being FOR THE FEET (uptempos). This is the import version, which features one extra track, the duet with Mary J Blige on \\"As\\", which was not placed on the US version as a punishment from the label for his bathroom escapades in 1998. As well there are two new songs, one on each disc.<br />FOR THE HEART features some of his most heartfelt ballad performances. Notables include \\"Jesus To A Child\\", \\"You Have Been Loved\\", \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\", \\"Careless Whisper\\", \\"Cowboys and Angels\\" and \\"One More Try\\".<br />FOR THE FEET features some of his best uptempo songs, such as \\"I Want Your Sex (Pt II), \\"Star People 97\\", \\"Too Funky\\", \\"Fastlove\\", etc. \\"Outside\\" is a great song, the new one on this disc, the video is among his best. Other highlights here include the duet with Aretha Franklin on \\"I Knew You Were Waiting For Me\\", the duet with Mary J Blige \\"As\\", \\"Hard Day\\", and more.<br />Overall this 29 song collection is a generous offering, and a must have for the fans, to remember some of his best known music. FOR THE HEART is perfect for reflection and relaxing, FOR THE FEET is perfect for getting ready to go out and party. Overall this is essential for the fans.
1587880490|3.0|I am a senior in high school who has just recently chose to read this book as part of a class assignment. To be truthful, I did not take time to actually see what this noble was about, I sort of just got it without knowing what to expect. Therefore, I believe teachers do not get all the credit they earned. This book teaches you those little things that we always leave out, and they are all good things. Morrie the outstanding professor shows how someone should react towards death, and how someone should live while being alive. However, the way that he reacted was amazing and at the same time odd. For one thing, I believe that if I was in my death bed I would make sure a left without any remorse and regrets of my past actions. What he was doing was just letting every day pass by as if nothing was going on. But I do respect that a lot, however, that would not be my choice. Why?  Because I believe that you should cherish every last day as if you are willing to make a huge impression. In addition, I would of also enjoyed the book a little more if the noble talked about more than one main event in both this mens lifes; such as part of there childhood or furthermore. Overall, it was an interesting book and I would highly recommend any one who has questions or doubts about death to read it.
B00005AXEL|5.0|After a hiatus, Stevie Nicks returned in May 2001 with her first new album of new material since 1994's STREET ANGEL. Time well spent I would say. This album is nothing short of amazing folks. The album starts off with a lot of energy, in the catchy title track which will stay in your head with its great chorus. Lyrically the album is very strong and consistent. The album continues with some great songs, &quot;Candlebright&quot;, &quot;Sorcerer&quot;. <BR>&quot;Planets Of the Universe&quot; is a unique song, which is definately a highlight on the album. Stevie works with Sheryl Crow on &quot;It's Only Love&quot; which was written and produced by Sheryl, as was other songs on the album. Sheryl also does her own version of &quot;It's Only Love&quot; on her 2002 disc C'MON C'MON. Other guest artists on this disc include Macy Gray, Natalie Maines and Sarah McLachlan. Other highlights here include &quot;I Miss You&quot;, &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot;, &quot;Every Day&quot; and more, all the songs are just great and she brings this certain aura to each song which is beautiful. Her voice is so full of resonance and emotion. Overall TROUBLE IN SHANGRI LA is one of her most consistent albums, since 1981's BELLADONNA.

0385484518|4.0|I am a senior in high school, and chose to read this book as part of a class assignment. However, it was more like a last minute time choice, since I got it without knowing what it was about or what to expect from it. I believe this book really gives you knowledge in the subject everyone loves to ignore, which is death. Not everyone enjoys or is comfortable talking about it, but there is no way out of it. Because everyone one day will have to go through that experience. Sometimes I think of what would it be like when I am dead or when I am dying; and I hate just the thinking about it. That is why I truly respect Morrie the way he took upon living his last days with so little strength. That is why if life were closing the door one me, I would not just look back and smile. Only a true man or women would do such a thing. Therefore, I did enjoy the book for the most part. However, I must admit there were times when it was difficult to keep on reading it since it did not capture the focus that wants to keep reading. The reason why sometimes it did not do this was because it only really talked about one main point in both these men's lives. And to be truthful at some points that could be kind of boring. Nevertheless, I would recommend it to anyone who really has doubts or questions about death, or at times, like myself, are scared of the fact that they must go through it at some point in there short lives. However, I believe that for many you will have the joy of being introduced to one of the most well respected man in this world; as a teacher, a husband, father, and friend.
B00004WG2X|5.0|This adaptation is true to the Jane Austen wit.  Even without its hollywood frills and thrills, it delivers the visual impression that my imaganation carries from the book.  I've had this video for about ten years and have read the book (at least) twice annually for fifteen years. Why the devotion to this 1980 adaptation?  Well, the book and the video are one in the same for me because Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul ARE Eliza and Darcy.  Not even the great Colin Firth can pull off a better Darcy. I think only a Jane Austen fan will truly understand the value of this version. For the rest of the world...I'm afraid you'll have to settle for A&amp;E's glamourized version.

B00005YW4H|4.0|I listened to Norah Jones first on PBS. Her story is of course interesting: she's the daughter of Ravi Shankar. Her music though is her own, and it is a bit like green wine, sweet and a bit intoxicating, but almost certain to get better with age.
B00005YU1O|3.0|The animation in Waking Life is unique and compelling, and thankfully distracts from the bland &quot;philosophical&quot; meanderings of the dialogue.  The ideas presented here are neither new nor particularly interesting, unless one is in high school, smoking up, or both.  This film takes the concept of lucid dreams and turns it into a mess of pseudo-intellectual drivel, which is a shame considering the apparent talent and potential of the filmmakers.
B00003CY0V|2.0|This is yet another film delving into the world of hacking.  The way that the film was shot was interesting - unusual camera angles, slow motion and effects kept me watching.  The costuming of the characters was terrific.  The storyline, however, lacked.  There were moments the movie was limp and spent too much time on mundane incidents.  The acting was contrived and not believable. Don't pay to see this one.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I gave this movie 1 star only cause that is the minimum, other wise it wouldn't get any stars from me. Mulholland Drive is one of these new generation \\"artsy\\" films that try to confuse you until the last scene of the movie and then reveal everything to pull it all together. Great movies like this inlcude Vanilla Sky and Memento. Unfortunately this movie only confuses you. The only reason why I sat through this 116 minute, poorly acted and poorly written movie was because I spent [money] to rent it. So I was determined to understand this very confusing storyline, but was left unsatisfied when the credits started rolling because I was still dumbfounded. I'm sure if I watched it about 5 times over I would get the plot but that would be torture and I have a life. So I came to Amazon.com to hopefully get the plot. And I thank all of the people who had the dedication to watch this movie 5 times over and explain it. What was also annoying was that there are no scene selections on the DVD. So of couse I was not able to finish the movie in one sitting so when I went back to it I had to sit for 5 minutes fast forwarding through the whole friggin movie. (which is actually more tollerable at 10x speed. and you don't miss out on any storyline). I do not suggest spending any money on this movie unless you really really want a good example of a extremely bad movie.
B00005LQ04|2.0|I agree with the people who said the movie was shot well, and the soundtrack is creepy....the transfer to dvd was very well done. I'm trying to be positive but that's about all the good I can say about this movie. I tried to like it, I really did.....but....no.  Masterpiece?? Try Romero. Maybe I just didn't get it...
B000063UR2|5.0|This is what DVD is all about, or at least what it can do at it's best.  This DVD offers two cuts of the same film, each restored to a luster they haven't enjoyed since they were seen in theaters.  Film-lovers can be very grateful that such ravishing visions have been allowed to re-surface.<br />As most people must know by now, Legend is a film by Ridley Scott that was very stupidly handled by the studio for American release.  It was re-cut to fit alleged audience expectations, and, probably even more damaging to the effect of the film, Jerry Goldsmith's sumptuous score was replaced with one by Tangerine Dream.  This DVD includes both versions of the film, the original version and the cut version that American audiences had to put up with.  The restored version is far superior to the cut version.  There is no question about it.<br />Tim Curry's performance as Darkness is a marvel.  Buried under what looks like 10 tons of makeup, he manages to deliver shadings of meaning and character that many other actors can't deliver with their bare faces.  The art direction is splendid, the cinematography likewise.  There are some touches that I can't say I like.  The bubbles that appear with the Gump, and some of comic relief dialogue come dangerously close to appearing cutesy, in marked contrast with the best parts of the film.  Tom Cruise never really seems comfortable as a fairy tale creature.  Fantasy isn't really his style, and it shows.  <br />But these are quibbles.  All in all, a DVD that is worth every penny.  Snap it up before the studios realize what a deal it is, and take it off the market.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is right up there as one of the best metal of all time. In my opinion it's metallicas best. Taking them in a direction that was first hinted in &quot;Ride The Lightning.&quot; It really makes you wonder that if Cliff Burton wasn't tragically killed, would they have stayed at the same level of work shown on the album and the Sell-outs Black, Load and Re-load would have never happened. This album is without a doubt the best in my collection of Cds. It's also the one that is the most frequently listened to. Every track on this album holds it's own as a song, not requiring on the others to pull it through. My personal favourite is Orion. A 8min instrumental that manages to emmerse me in it at every listen. The whole of this album oozes with genius, from the questioning lyrics of Hetfield, The rapid fast solo work from Hammett (feturing the title track solo, which was considered in the top 40 solos of all time by guitar magazine), The energy-filled relentless drumming of Ulrich to the manic and innovative bass of Burton. Surely he couldn't have gone out on a better note.<BR>Quite simply, the best thing thats every happened for metal full stop.
0553260111|3.0|I recently read Boatswain's Mate by Pat Johnston and found it to be more interesting than The Bourne Identity.  It's faster paced and the characters are more believable.  It's a down to earth Navy story with fewer twists and turns but more action.  Maybe Bourne Identity will work better as a movie.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Ok, is \\"Swordfish\\" an intelligent, suspensful thriller? Nope. Was it ever intended to make the Academy Awards nomination list? Nope. Then what is it?<br /><br />... Yes, it is senseless violence, gratuitous nudity and sex that don't \\"add to the storyline,\\" and paper-thin plotting. If you have sufficient knowledge of computer security, you'll probably grit your teeth at some of the obvious flaws in the cracker aspect of the story. However, this movie is also great action and incredible stunts. And, yes, I think I WILL \\"marvel at director Dominic Sena's biggest money shot--a 360-degree pan as a robbery hostage is blown to bits by a bomb that pelts a surrounding SWAT squad with deadly ball bearings.\\" When I saw the first 10 minutes in the theatre, I simply said, \\"Wow.\\"<br /><br />If you want high-brow \\"artsy\\" movies, go rent \\"Gosford Park\\" (my own personal snore fest for this year's Oscar race). If you want a fun, thrilling little movie that has yummy eye candy--Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry, depending on your preference--pick up \\"Swordfish.\\" Sometimes movies are meant to simply entertain and be fun. \\"Swordfish\\" accomplishes that. You'll want this one on DVD because the sound and picture quality are not even close on the VHS edition. This is a watch-again popcorn-flick that this chick was happy to add to her DVD collection.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I shouldn't really give a review to this CD. But I bought it, and my review is as good as anyone's, right? But put this in perspective. I don't particularly like this genre of music, and yet I give this CD a solid 3. Could I give a album of this genre a 4 or 5? Yes. Well why don't you? Lack of variety/creativity. But this album does have creativity. Yes, in the lyrics, very cleverly thought out. Musically, could be improved. [[FOR EXAMPLE BEN KWELLER'S SHA SHA GETS A 4.5.]] So, you wound up giving this album a 3, Why? SUBSTANCE. Look beyond &quot;No Such Thing&quot;. This CD is much more complex and better put together than any DMB album out there. There are people out there who worship John Mayer, and while he is good, he needs to spice things up a little bit on his next effort, before he becomes the next Dave Matthews, where fans cling on to his music despite lackluster efforts. My opinion, before jumping all over this guy, check out some Ben Folds Five and Ben Kweller, then check this out. Just a few notches below but he does have the potential to do better. Just be a little more creative.
038533558X|2.0|The characters are not believable. None of them. The hero<BR>is so weak one wonders how it is that two 'beautiful' women<BR>fell in love with him. Publishing has become a game of 'Names'<BR>and Hype. If you must read this book, do what I did. Get it<BR>from your local library. Thank me later...
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer's blue album has to be one of the finest debut albums to come out in years. Each of the 10 songs flow very well into eachother, and while the album is short, it does contain many memorable moments. It seems like everyone has their own personal favorite song on this album. That is the thing about this album. Every track stands out. My personal favorite? That would have to be &quot;Holiday&quot;. That is the way I try to live my life, full of adventure. Each song speaks to different individuals. I don't really see how anyone can dislike this album, unless you don't enjoy this genre of music. I highly recommend this album to add to your collection. This is really a feel-good (but not overly feel good like the Green Album) album that will remain timeless in my collection.
B000002MY3|5.0|An inspiring album that is peaceful, enjoyable and at the same time one you would want to dance along with. Jagged Little Pill is still Alanis' best album ever as well as being one of my all time favourite albums! <br />    The hit of the album for quite a few people was the Grammy-award winning single of the year &quot;you outta know&quot;! Well...not exactly my thoughts. My friends and I always loved &quot;ironic&quot; even before the video was released. &quot;Ironic&quot; is a peaceful, fun, alternative musical theme that you would want to play constantly. It's Alanis' biggest &quot;CD single sales&quot; track being certified gold.  If you enjoyed &quot;thank you&quot; you would enjoy this single. It's one of my all-time favourite records (see listmania list). Alanis is a great singer with a fabulous voice and a great writer. If you happen to enjoy this album you should check out &quot;rug under swept&quot; and &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;. But if you're only going to buy one Alanis album, this one should be it. <br />Ironic- The hit of the album for me. This alternative/pop trackis peaceful and very enjoyable.<br />U outta know- A rock bad-tempered constructive single.<br />Hand in my pocket- good voice variations and a good constant background beat. <br />You learn- A sweet catchy beat, second only to &quot;ironic&quot;.<br />Head over feet- Another enjoyable new age type catchy single. <br />Wake up- the album's longest track, a solid sweet alternative rock hit!<br />Different songs in their own way make this album one that would be enjoyable for all Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Celine Dion, Enya, Shania Twain, Christina Aguilera, and U2 fans! If you like this album you should check out some of her other works (mainly &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;hands clean&quot;)!
B00005NW02|4.0|&quot;Chop Suey&quot; was a song intended to be a radio hit. They established themselves as a solid band. The problem with this band, accesibility. People don't realize how vocally talented Serj actually is. The band definately revolves around his vocal in your face style which I like to compare to a boxing match. For example, a boxer looks to size up his opponent, and then attack with a flurry of punches, think of Serj's style as that, a bit overdone and exaggerated in &quot;Chop Suey&quot; but well done throughout the rest of the album. Very solid all around album. Standout tracks for me - &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, but the album is all around good, and worthy of 4 Stars.
B00005JKCF|4.0|i saw this yesterday and have to say its not any like i expected.  the effects are obviously crouching tiger hidden dragons leftovers. the romance was interesting. the acting other than wilem dafoe was excellent. the plot was good.  overall this is quite good but nothing for little ones. 10 and up please. because it is quite scary at points.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is worthy of a 4.5, however, I have no problem giving it a 5-star rating, because this album seperated Incubus from the rest of the competition. How so? Brandon Boyd's voice gets more unique and the group as a whole has no problem with experimentation. These guys are so experienced that they know which formulas work. For example, just check out \\"Aqueous Transmission\\". My personal favorite? \\"Blood on the Ground\\", however, the three songs you hear on the radio are all gems too. \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" is definately geared for the radio audience, yet is so layered that you probably wont mind hearing it a few extra times. \\"Nice to Know You\\", great drums in this song, and the newest single \\"Warning\\" is my personal favorite of the 3, the video still freaks me out a little. Anyway, it's hard to get a 5 star rating out of me, but this album is very deep and if you have the money to spare on a recent CD, I would probably get this one. <br />P.S. I heard they are awesome live, and I get to see them on June 11th :)
B000000993|5.0|If 90's rock had an avatar, it would have been Undertow. Tool's second CD release is such a drastic step up from the drab and generic Opiate that one would be hard pressed to believe they were listening to the same band. Stylish, deep, intricate, thought provoking and very, very angry best sum up this album. Maynard James Keenan, whose voice can bludgeon one to oblivion then sooth the bruises, displays greater range and versatility than any other artist in the known universe (no kidding, listen to this CD, then listen to A Perfect Circle), only to be outdone by himself on the later released Lateralus. Danny Carey's drumming is superb, while Paul and Adam (Bassist and Guitarist) grind out some fabulous chords. On the whole, the album sounds much more like Opiate on Dopamine (har har), than Aenema (With the exception of 4 Degrees, which is a simply spectacular Prog Rock song). A good place to start for people looking to get into Tool, although Aenema might be a better choice. A Masterpiece.
B00004Z459|3.0|I wish I could give this a 3.5, but what can I say, I am a tough reviewer. Chester has a very nice aggresive voice, and this album does have some very high points. What keeps me from giving it an all out 4 is that some songs sound very similar (see &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot;, however, I am confident that this young group will grow as artists, and it is definately worth the purchase. Other highlights include &quot;Runaway&quot; and the first single &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. Again, not to take anything away from these guys but I hear a lot of potential and hopefully as they grow, we'll hear the best from this group.
0930289331|4.0|Batman: Year One is honestly one of the best comics I have ever read.  The script was written beautifully, and the subtle yet extremely fitting art work helps bring this dark story to life.  This is a story of two men, Bruce Wayne and James Gordon, comming to grips with the harsh reality of Gotham City, and working out how they can handle the city's crime.  One of the best aspects of this story, is that it is not an obscure tale of some powerful beings.  These two men are real, they feel pain, they feel anger, and they feel scared... and you feel it right with them.  There are some very memorable scenes in this book, and visions of the Dark Knight that I go back to re-read over and over again.  This book is more than worth the purchase, even for a first time reader.
038533558X|4.0|Lots of twists and turn, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, Coban throws you another curveball.  Definitely a worthwhile read!
0553106635|5.0|Martin's series continues to get better and better, and that's no mean feat given the extremely good quality in his first two installments of the series. It seems everyone these days is writing \\"epic\\" fantasy, presumeably because the stories cannot be contained in one volume and enhance book sales. Martin is almost unique in that, while certainly guilty of assuring continued income by writing a six part series, he actually writes WELL, and has an ENGROSSING story to tell. There are plot twists and circumlocutions galore. <br />In this volume, we get to study the motivations of Ser Jaime, the champion of house Lannister. In what has to be one of the best written examples of turning one's preconceptions onto their head, we find out that Jaime, one of the key villains in Books 1 and 2, despite his incestuous relationship with his sister and an unfortunate tendency to inafanticide, really isnt that bad of a guy...you actually grow to kinda LIKE him. The Red God, the sinister god whose priestess uses necromancy and dark arts to defeat the enemies of the direct heir of the throne, is gradually being revealed as a vengeful god with good intentions, uniting the southern kingdoms against the threat from the North by any means necessary (VERY Old Testament, in fact). Just as we find out that Jaime isnt all bad, we also discover that some of the characters we assumed as being \\"good\\" had their despicable moments, mainly through recollections of the war against the house Targaryen and the atrocities committed by our \\"heroes\\" to ensure that the family line dies out. Just as he takes characters you initially detest and pray for comeuppance and reveals them as actually quite nice guys, he takes characters in whose mouth butter wouldnt melt and reveals them as mean spirited, despicable and thoroughly deserving of a good caning. <br />Another Martin trademark, we say \\"good-bye\\" to several key characters introduced during the first few books. The author invests a tremendous amount ofcharacter development into what become key characters, so much so that you find yourself subconsciosly assuming that these \\"friends\\" will be with you throughout the series. Martin's intent, clearly, is to make you so fond of these characters that, when they do die, most often horribly, you definitely experience an emotional response. To put it mildly, he succeeds in this very well. Im wondering who will die next ... no character is safe. The political intrigue is sufficiently byzantine to keep one enthralled, as well. <br />Finally, the book ends in one of the most heart wrenching examples of betrayal I have read to date, though you get some small measure of revenge, as well as a shock, in the epilogue. The book, while slowly adding more fantasy elements like magic and dragons, makes the fantasy elements tertiary to the story and character development. I am not alone in eagerly awaiting the fourth installment in this truly gripping series.
B000002GYR|5.0|Tom Waits never made another album like this again. Although his voice, lyrics, and instrumentation remained sane for his next album, by the release of Nighthawks At The Diner, his third album, his sweet and melodic balladeer style prevalent on this album had vanished almost completely, and he certainly never sang in this register again. Actually, this is almost the last Tom Waits album I bought: I had all of his later, weirder stuff first. And, the first time I put this CD in, starting it up without really thinking about what it was... I didn't recognize it at first! Tom sings so different. Although this album shows signs that point toward his later wild artistic evolution, there is certainly nothing to suggest the musical and lyrical minefields that he would later plow. Still, had Waits made albums throughout his career that were only mere copies - or logical extensions of this one - he still would've had a rather fine and respectable career. It's so beautiful and melancholic: this is the real &quot;Piano Man&quot; crooning songs of late night loneliness, heartbreak, and melancholy from a late night bar, sitting at a beer-stained, cigarette-adled old piano. It may well be simple and perhaps not very ambitious in scope, but it's just damn near perfect for what it is. This is about the best set of ballads you'll ever hear. Tom's piano playing here is so beautiful, and his voice is sweet. Delicate background vocals and lush strings (including the beautiful closing set title track instrumental) only contribute to the atmosphere. Though undoubtedly stylized, the songs here are just about impeccable. From the classic Ol' 55 to I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You (and very neat and somewhat unique ballad) to the heart-breaking torch song Martha (one of the best I've ever heard), to just - well, the whole album is excellent. Waits never made another album like this one again, and it's worth looking back on this overlooked classic. It is, in many ways, one of his best albums - it's certainly unique among his catalog. Perhaps you might say it is a hidden gem. Many people say that this is his best album - or their favorite - and you can certainly see where they're coming from. Although he would later go on to create much more artistically ambitious works and become one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, the fact remains that Tom Waits released this overlooked masterpiece of a debut album in 1973, and it is worthwhile for all of us to listen, and belongs in everyone's collection. A finer collection of ballads you will not find.
B00004W5UA|4.0|\\"Fight Club\\" is a bit more than you would think by watching the trailers or looking at the packaging.  Think about \\"Memento\\" when you watch this.  The overall message is about freedom, from ideas and material things, and about anarchy.  The story itself will cause you to do a double-take.  <br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give intense performances.  This intensity adds to the graphic nature of the violence in this movie.  As gory as it is, you will still have trouble turning your eyes away from it.  It is a bit disquieting.<br />The movie also has Helena Bonham-Carter and Meatloaf.  Neither one had a part really large enough to get inside the character.<br />I would recommend this movie more for rental than purchase.
0375707972|3.0|I thought this was a great book, once I started reading it I couldn't stop. Its a great example of power and control and how damaging it is for young boys to engage in relationships with older women or vise versa . It was clear that having been involved in this relationship did not allow the boy to move on with his life.
0066620996|5.0|If you want to lead your company to greatness, read this book. If not, don't bother; you won't understand or appreciate it. The book is best read slowly, carefully, and analytically...with highlighter or notepad close at hand. You will find each chapter through-provoking, inspirational, and stimulating. Savvy readers will be motivated to initiate specific actions before even completing the book. <br />&quot;Good to Great&quot; is actually, in the author's mind, a prequel to his best-selling &quot;Built to Last.&quot; It's a research-based report of what it takes to move from being a good company to a great company. His focus is on organizations that have sustained great results for at least 15 years. The selection criteria, explained in the book, were tough. The book examines companies that moved from mediocrity to extraordinary performance, exploring how they did it and what common lessons might be learned. <br />Is this usable information for your company? Collins asserts &quot;Our five-year quest yielded many insights, a number of them surprising and quite contrary to conventional wisdom, but one giant conclusion stands out above the others: We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've uncovered.&quot; <br />The chapters are organized according to what Collins and his researchers learned makes companies great: Good is the Enemy of Great, Level 5 Leadership, First Who, then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, Hedgehog Concept, Culture of Discipline, and Technology Accelerators. The book moves then to explain the flywheel and doom loop concepts that enable the other factors to either enable the company build momentum to high achievement or wind down to a whimper and drop off the radar screen. Closing the book, Collins relates this work to his previous work reported in &quot;Built to Last.&quot; The Frequently Asked Questions epiloguehelps tighten the readers' focus, as do the summaries at the end of each chapter. There are several research appendices for those who wish to look behind the curtain.<br />This is a powerful book with a wealth of messages about how the eleven Great Companies did it. Example follows example, with painfully simple methodology. Amazingly, most executives and managers get in their own way, making it impossible for them to make the leap from good to great. The companies Collins used to compare against his chosen few suffered from that dilemma, and Collins names names to tell the story of exactly what happened-or didn't happen. Expect to be a bit embarrassed by what you have done or not done, but at the same time educated about what you need to do now. <br />You may not agree with everything you read in &quot;Good to Great,&quot; but you'll think. And you'll act. And that makes a book powerful. This is a book you'll recommend to others.
B000002H97|5.0|Ok, most of everybody has probably already heard the songs \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"The Unforgiven\\" or \\"Nothing Else Matters.\\" Why? Because they get some radio-play. They are probably the songs that get most listeners into this band and pretty soon they purchase all the albums and become a metallica fan. That's how i became a metallifan because The Black Album was the first studio album i bought. Now i own all the albums and i would have to say that their best are 'Master of Puppets' and 'Ride the Lightning.' <BR>But the Black Album is a great album with a more melodic side compared to the previous album \\"..And Justice for All.\\" Their songwriting has evolved into a more complex meaning. The rhythm in all the songs are very catchy and well all the solos are strong and powerful because Hammett remains as probably one of the best lead guitarist along with Dimebag Darrell, Kerry King and Marty Friedman.<BR>Here are reviews for the songs:<br />Enter Sandman: One of their best and most popular songs of all. 5/5<br />Sad But True: Great song with great drum beats. its too bad kid rock took the rhythm for this song to make 'American Badass.' <BR>4/5<br />Holier Than Thou: Probably one of the heaviest songs in the album. Otherwise a great song.<BR>4.5/5<BR> <BR>The Unforgiven: A great slow song that talks about the government controlling weaker peoples' lives. <BR>5/5<br />Wherever I May Roam: The intro is really great. This is one of my favorite songs in the album. <BR>5/5<br />Don't Tread on Me: ..\\"Liberty or Death\\" this sounds something like from 'Justice for all'. Better than average song.<BR>3.5/5<br />Through the Never: Another really heavy song. Not as good as Holier Than Thou.<BR>3.5/5<br />Nothing Else Matters: THE SLOWEST SONG metallica has ever done. It is another radio-played song that is dedicated to loved ones.<BR>4.5/5<br />Of Wolf And Man: Great intro and a catchy tune. Lars Ulrich does great with this song. some wolf moans and noises make this song be a perfect song for a Werewolf horror movie.<BR>5/5<br />The God That Failed: Great song with a great bass tune in the beginning. This song is mostly about broken promises.<BR>4.5/5<br />My Friend of Misery: Another of my favorite songs. It is the longest song in the album and has probably the best songwriting.<BR>5/5<br />The Struggle Within: The last and probably the heaviest song in the album along with 'Holier' and 'Through the Never'. AMAZING drumming from Ulrich makes this song a favorite for the heavy-preffered fans.<br />5/5<br />  This album is REALLY GOOD and it's probably the best album to start off from. If you prefer the more heavy-metal style, then 'Master of Puppets' would be the best. But overall, this one and the previous albums are the best.
6304539258|4.0|People who don't like this movie simply don't look at it the right way, and people who adore have got it all out of proportions. In my opinion the (original) star wars trilogy are perfect B-movies. That is, they are not deep, nor thought provoking - they set out to entertain the viewer and they do it marvelously well. The movie itself is simple, which allows Lucas to keep the plot tight, the characters focused,<BR>the suspense high. The dialog is not high class, but the actors make it wonderful because they have great chemistry and a load of self conscious humor, as if they know they're making a B-movie and enjoying every minute of it, which makes the viewer enjoy watching them. Lucas has also thrown in a bit of mysticism (the force), ala matrix, to give the movie a unifying theme. The end result is a very satisfying film - this is what summer blockbusters are supposed to be like, but somehow, today, are sadly not. I think any person wanting to entertain an audience, as opposed to, say, intrigue and make people think, should study this movie closely. This movie is top notch entertainment. This is ALL it is - but I just wish all movies were as entertaining as this one ...
B000000JO3|5.0|For me this was a total revelation. I already was sXe, mainly influenced by the likes of Snapcase and Better Than A 1000. I had heard of these guys but never heard their music. Until then......<br />Damn! How could I not have tried this sooner! It's just brilliant, from beginning to end. Ian McKaye's more recent band Fugazi may not be one of my favorites; this is just perfect. What can I say? I could write a thousand words about this (actually, that's my max...) but I'm short on words. Just listen to it and you'll know what I mean. Try it if you like Better Than A 1000, Dead Kennedys or Youth Of Today. Old School hardcore stuff!
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL is not like any other band.  they are TRUE artists in every sense of the word.  this is most exemplified in LATERALUS- truly one of the greatest albums of all time.  when the dust settles and everyone is dead, this album will be whispering through the wind.  it is an experience that consumes everything in its path. the bass and drumwork is beautifully done, the guitars are hypnotic.  maynard's voice is...well, maynard's voice.  he reaches depths that no one can imitate.  every element TOOL uses blends together so harmoniously it burrows into your mind, nesting until it explodes with such energy like in TICKS&amp;LEECHES and the title track- which is my favorite.  speaking of the title track- i loved the fact it got so much radio play - it's over 9 minutes long, and it just dominated.  a side note- smoke up then listen to it, it takes you someplace else.  anyways, if you appreciate art and great music, BUY THIS ALBUM.  The first time you listen HAS to be from start to finish doing nothing else.
B00004TH6O|5.0|After the way too early end of Kyuss, thank god there were some incarnations. Including QOTSA, as you probably had guessed. Where the first album still carried heavy influences from Kyuss' later work (And the circus leaves town, Sky valley), this album introduces many new styles and blends all those into one new style: Queensrock. Nah, just kidding. At the core this is still stoner rock but it's way beyond that. Every song is completely different from the one before it. And the one next to it. And still every song is as great as the other. Great laidback singing too. Just great!
B000063UR2|3.0|Ahh, what is there to be said. After watching both as soon as I got the DVD from Amazon, I find that I am completely dumbfounded at Scott's choices of cuts in the director's edition. The first half was magic as only true fantasy storytelling could be in every aspect except the music (which I'll get to later). However, after the setting moves to Darkness' keep, it becomes apparent why Scott made the cuts he made in the first place when Legend was first theatrically released. The standoff between Darkness and Lili loses its edge and tension with the director's cut and becomes something akin to dinner conversation with a new date. This is symptomatic of the entire second half, as the director's cut loses the cohesiveness and pacing of the original release with alot of unnecessary and out of place scenes and dialogue. Yes I understand that such scenes were meant to add to each character's development, but I think Scott failed in that regard here. In the first half he was successful, revealing for the first time Jack's ability to speak with animals and such, but in the dramatic second half it just gets in the way and interrupts the drama and action. And Darkness' father has a really annoying voice now too.<br />As for the music, I really was disappointed with Goldsmith's work, which has been superb in other movies. It was not nearly as emotive as the TD score nor as unique and supportive of the scenes. Specifically, the TD score was far superior in the black dress dancing scene a waltzy dance number with a hint of discord and evil whereas the Goldsmith score was a dance, rather light and breezy which of course did not fit at all. And he botched the ending! The original ending was nearly perfect, and he completely deviates from it. But oh well, I have to go to work, hope this helps.
0061020680|5.0|Well, it's kinda hard for me to choose my favorite in the Discworld series since every episode has got its great moments. Still, I'd choose this one. For me, it's the best work mr Pratchett has every delivered. Humoristic of course, and as always a brilliant plot. And interesting characters. They're all elements Pratchett got famous for and well, let me tell you he really deserved it. For those who think LOTR is a bit too heavy this is perfect, since it's much easier to read. And for those who love LOTR (like me), well...this is perfect too!
B00004XONN|4.0|...<br />Anyway, the album...<br />A real grower. The opening song features Thom's voice buzzing like some prog-rocker junkie<BR>feeding on Calvin's Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs. Fading in and out with a deep and resonant<BR>organ, Radiohead appear to be telling us that their own statements are meaningless and drowned<BR>in media. Or something. <BR>The second track plays like a nursery kid stumbling around the building blocks of music. Trying to<BR>say something significant but with no clue as to anything. A small child in a electronically cloying<BR>atmosphere of suburbia. Or something.<BR>The third track is a roaring, riotous, cacophony of fabness. Trumpets wail, things get smashed and<BR>there is an amazingly menacing bass line. Possibly the stand out track. All otherworldly and angry.<BR>Sounds like Derek Jarman doing Clockwork Orange in Blairite Britain with towering holographic<BR>billboards advertising Gap and McDonalds during election atrophy. Or something. <BR>(Repeat until funny, that's what I always say.)<BR>Quickly now. How to Disappear Completely is ethereal and curiously like Shane McGowan on<br />valium, mumbling like a god-head. Floating down the liffey. No it isn't. It's like glaciers floating<BR>down the Thames. The most serene and epic you're going to get on this album. It has a wonderful<BR>building sense and a strong pulse. Or something.<BR>(Skip forward)<BR>Optimistic is a hard driving, Joy Division-ey, scary rocker. Very sharp and scathing. <BR>Idioteque is a fab techno-ish jaunt. Sort of piling forward, driving through the night kinda thing.<BR>One of my fave tracks. <BR>Morning Bell is a little shrill, but features a wonderful backing. Possibly trying a little too hard,<BR>but I'm danged if I'll stop him now.<BR>Motion Picture Soundtrack. Pretty slight but enchanting. Still, mixed feelings about this track.<br />Definitely worth getting then. I wouldn't count it as whiny, either. Radiohead are just providing an<BR>alternative voice. There are a lot of very sly digs in his lyrics at reading too much into 'alienation'<BR>in his stuff. The hysterical cry of \\"Where'd you park the car?\\" as some sort of millennial clarion<BR>call of terror is an amusing high point of sarcasm. Forget the huge blanket of yea and nay-saying.<BR>Cut through the satellite chants and just accept Radiohead for what they are, a quiet band who try<BR>their hardest to write top albums. The current sorry state of Brit indie is not their fault. They did<BR>not create Starsailor. They just want to be loved, y'know?<br />In summary? Rather lovely.
B000002NIW|5.0|For me, ATF is Deftones' finest work to date. While White Pony was very eclectic (beautiful of course, five stars!) and Adrenaline was very hardcore based (once again five stars) this CD has the perfect balance between those. It has very peaceful, gentle songs but, on the other hand, also very angry, aggresive songs. Still, they are all in the same style, and that's where White Pony was different. It contained songs which were very much like the old stuff (like Korea) but it even had triphop (Teenager). Hmm. Sounds like I'm criticzing that CD now, but that's not true. I'm just trying to point it out why I called this one my fav. Anyway, the music is great and also the vocals stand out. The lyrics are great too; sometimes very abstract but that makes it more mysterious and it also contributes to the arty feeling Deftones' music always has had. Also a guest appearance on this album by former Sepultura singer (now Soulfly - I don't like em very much) Max Cavalera on Headup and a hidden track. It's called Damone, by the way. Well, I could only advise you to buy this. It's special and unique. One to love.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I was glad to hear that Francis Ford Coppola had joined into the Hollywood cottage industry of reissuing classic films with new directorial re-editing and added footage. In what can only be described as a psychedelic adventure of the century, the newest version of Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" reverberates the very screen it is being shown on, in this case my new 53 inch Sony projection TV set. It was a joy to spend more time with the ensemble of memorable characters populating this film, from the shockingly violent portrayal by Martin Sheen as the young captain sent as an assassin on a mission to terminate a renegade Colonel's command with \\"extreme prejudice\\", to Robert Duvall's stunning performance as a gung-ho warrior whose comical fascination with surfing along the Mekong Delta numbs him to the carnage swirling around him. He appears to be immune. When men question his taking a ridge to facilitate someone trying to ride the waves, he quips, \\"Charlie can't surf!\\"<br />There is Lawrence Fishburne in one of his first roles, and Frederick Forsythe likewise turning in a key performance. There is, of course, Dennis Hopper, as a burned-out news correspondent turned acid freak turned court fool, and even a very young and taciturn Harrison Ford as a young Colonel's assistant in the opening scenes in Saigon.  Trying to describe Marlon Brando's turn as the psychotic renegade Colonel is difficult, other than to say that it seems inspired, a chilling portrait of a man whose life seemed to suddenly lurch off the highway of life careening recklessly into the volcano lurking within. What we see here are men trying to survive the random madness of war, trying to cope in whatever fashion as they can muster to hold back the hands of fate, knowing all the while that they will likely not succeed.  And so we venture as Sheen and the crew of his patrol boat take a journey up the river into the heart of darkness. This is a ride well worth taking, and an even more unforgettable movie in its new and extended re-edited version. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!ie in its new and extended re-edited version. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
B000001FS3|5.0|Well, I'm kinda new to U2 so if I write stuff whereof you think DUH or 'ya dunno what y're talkin bout', now you know why. Still, I would like to say that this is a very great album. It's very relaxing (at least, that's my opinion) and it's full of great songs, which are also lyrically oustanding. Although the best lyrics stay the ones to God Part II, still this record has also great lyrics. Buy this. <br />BTW, gotta question. Why are only 3 lyrics in the booklet and some white pages? At least, my version has...
038533558X|5.0|After reading &quot;Tell no one&quot; in approximately 2 hours, I was eagerly awaiting Harlan Coben's new work - and again, he does not disappoint!<br />Gone for Good is another amazing thriller which you will not be able to put down. Its a real page turner, with so many twists and plot turns, that it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.<br />I recommend this to every thriller fan out there! You will not regret buying this book!
B000001FI7|5.0|...that Portishead is one of a kind. I truly love their music, but it's a pity that they're so unique that it's almost impossible to find similar bands. Thank god I have found some (Goldfrapp, Mazzy Star, Hooverphonic - the latter being my least favorite) but still Portishead is on top. The music is just great and very soothing. The hiphoppy beats combined with the beautiful melodies and of course the terrific voice of Beth Gibbons make this album a masterpiece in triphop. Get it!
0738206679|5.0|In the networked world it is important to understand connections and how they affect us.  This book takes some of the hottest research in physics, mathematics and sociology [strange bedfellows, eh?] over the last 4 years and makes it very interesting.  Insights into how the internet works, how epidemics spread in human networks, how the info economy works, what's happening in microscopic biological networks and glimpses into business and terrorist organizations.<br />Also, many interesting 'real life' peeks at the scientists doing this cutting edge research. For a scientist, Barabasi is a great story teller!<br />Hard core research distilled to be understood by non-geniuses... worth reading... several times.
B00005MNP8|5.0|BLONDIE kicked around for several years and released a couple of albums without developing more than a very localized New York following, where the band was generally considered a sort of punk-pop fusion--and then in the late 1970s came PARALLEL LINES, which vaulted them to a superstardom seldom seen even in the high profile music world.  And listening to the recording today it is easy to understand why: absolutely everything about the album is perfect.<br />As a whole, PARALLEL LINES manages to walk a fine line between several different musical styles.  Most of the tracks have a bouncy, almost bubble-gum feel: catchy and memorable with driving rhythms.  But the arrangements are anything but bubble-gum: they rely on a mix of synthesizers and traditional drums-bass-guitar in a way that essentially defines the entire \\"new wave\\" sound of the late 1970s.  And the lyrics, often savage, frequently satircal, and always memorable, are edgy and witty and sharp and about as far from pop as one can get.<br />All of that would have been enough to make a hit album--but BLONDIE also had the front singer to end all front singers: Debbie Harry, who mixed tough and sexy and pretty and naughty to tremendous effect--and whose full-throated voice actually contrived to SOUND blonde.  Whether we're talking about the sleek, disco-like \\"Heart of Glass\\" or the punk-edged \\"Just Go Away\\" or the new wave \\"Fade Away and Radiate,\\" the music here suits her unique voice perfectly--and the result is a truly flawless group of recordings that set the standard for the next decade.  Blondie would do several more recordings before the band collapsed, and some of them would be very good--but PARALLEL LINES is IT, a landmark in the pop music lexicon.  This remastered release, which includes a couple of live recordings for good measure, is an essential in any pop music library.  Strongly recommended.
B00000K3G8|5.0|To Hell with Johnathan Demme...<br />Great movie or not, (and it really is great)the music is better.  This is probably the last time the Heads were truly awesome.<br />This album seems to catch a point in time when the Heads were at their most vital and most potent.<br />As &quot;Stones Live at the Max&quot; reaaly catches the Stones at their flame-throwing prime, this album catches the Heads before they became Byrne's back-up band.<br />Not that I don't love the dance/pop stuff that follows...it's that this is really where the CBGB club stuff comes to a head, and really just explodes.<br />This is such a good band...perhaps the best American band ever, and this album truly captures them at the peak of their art.<br />I really miss the Heads.
B000055X3U|5.0|I was impressed by Alternative 4, but I was blown away by Judgement.  Unfortunately however, it took me six months to figure it out.<br />I had gotten the CD months ago, but after first listen I put it back in my case and didn't take it out again for six months.  Then when I got hooked on A Fine Day to Exit, I knew I had to give this album another chance.  And I'm glad I did.<br />I can't decide which one I like better:  Judgement or A Fine Day to Exit.  Either way, they're both fantastic albums.  Judgement is the most depressing of the two (even more so than Alternative 4), while A Fine Day to Exit is more upbeat.  Judgement also has my most favorite Anathema songs of all time on it:  Perisienne Moonlight, Judgement, Emotional Winter, and Don't look too Far.<br />My only complains is that the album drags a little bit towards the end, but it isn't bad enough to distract from it's overall appeal.  If you like music that actually MEANS something, pick this up.  If you like intelligent musicianship, pick this up.
B000000WCA|5.0|Okay, so what? I like the Spice Girls. There is just this strange aura of mystery around them that makes them so charismatic. I wish that I could be as untalented as they are and still make millions of dollars - unfortunately I am not that cool. Their debut LP, Spice, is what started the whole craze off in 1997, when the then 5-some blazed the music scene. This CD has several tracks that truly epitomize what teen pop represents. \\"Wannabe,\\" \\"Say You'll Be There,\\" \\"2 Become 1,\\" and \\"Who Do You Think You Are,\\" are just a few of my favorites. A blend of clever voice-enhancement gadgets and purely synthetic music make this album epitomize what it means to have a good time -some good-fashioned FUN! Indeed, we could all use that bit of wisdom today!
6303282237|5.0|Ths is a GREAT historical epoch , in my opinion , with Heston at his best just as in Ben Hur .
B00005RHGK|5.0|this movie has such an unusual plot and it doesn't flow or end like a typical horror movie.  this makes this film a must have for all horror film fans.
B00005JL3A|5.0|first of all when i saw this movie in theaters it rocked but i would like to say how did final fantasy get all these extra feautures when resident evil was a better movie because i wouldlike to see alternate stuff and a documentary on how they made everything but apart from that i'm still goanna by this because i liked the movie.
B000062TU1|5.0|I cant wait for the next one!<BR>Excellent storyline with a great cast.<BR>Great magical effects.<BR>Wouldn't we all like to of gone to hogwarts!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Most good bands progress (ac/dc exluded ha!).  The Beatles, Tortoise, Wilco, etc... If you have heard Summerteeth (their album before this one) you can tell that Jeff and company are doing something different, this new album is an extension of that. There are these killer songs with lyrics, melodies, and lots of cool sounds, that is a good recipe for pop/rock goodness. Summerteeth is one of my favorite albums of all time and I think Hotel Yankee Foxtrot is catching up.
B00005YXZH|5.0|If you need guideposts, try this: it's recent Radiohead, only with much better-constructed songs. The creativity walks hand in hand with the craftsmanship. I love this one.
B0000668IF|2.0|Up to this point, inspiration and creative energy have hallmarked Moby's efforts, making every listen a new and renewing experience. '18' falls very short of the standard Moby has set for himself in his previous work. The first track is a corny radio edit that fails to sustain interest for any significant period of time. The rest of the album appears to be B-side and editing room floor material from 'Play.' What is most disappointing about this effort is the apparent and utter lack of emotional commitment in the music. Sustaining the intensity typical of previous releases must no doubt be difficult, but I'd rather have gone without a new album for awhile than suffer the immense disappointment I have with this half-hearted (if that) attempt.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This was one of the first DVD's I bought after getting my DVD player. It's wonderful to re-live this piece of my childhood, and also see the little extras that are included.
6300268470|5.0|John Wanye plays John T. Chance a Sheriff who is holding a man in jail for murder. The man's brother is the most powerful rancher in the valley. John T. Chance is assisted by Stumpy (Walter Brennan), Dude (Dean Martin) who has just ended a two year drinking ordeal. Later on when Chance's old friend Pat (Ward Bond) comes to town he brings with him Colorado (Ricky Nelson) who is young, riding guard and is unsure if he wants to join Chance in the fight. Joe (Claude Akins)is the man being held in jail, and time and time again he is nearly released as his brother Nathan (John Russell) pays men to try and get him out. Angie Dickenson who plays Chance's love interest, can never really get him interested, these would prove to be some of John Wayne's most difficult scenes up to that point! The film with it's solid acting and rousing music score by Dimitri Tiomkin proves to be a more than enjoyable film. Howard Hawks with his very steady hand as a director has made a American classic, it's a solid film all around! Also with two catchy songs sung by Dude, Colorado and Stumpy! <BR>Grade:A
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love the beatles im a teenager and my favorite kind of music is oldies. this cd is great a lot of people own it and it has the best songs on it.
B00000K501|5.0|I have been listening to this band since my teenage son introduced me to them about 5 years ago, and have not stopped listening since. I finally bought the video live aus berlin recently and it is AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, EXCEPTIONAL, and every good adjective that there is. THEIR IS NO OTHER BAND LIKE THEM. Now if I can only find some more videos I'll be extremely happy.<BR>Thank you Rammstein.
B000002NZO|5.0|I'm a listener of all kind of music, I was listening King Crimson at 10 years old. I consider part of the progressive rock of the '70 , the modern music that the most closer reach the beauty and the power of the music itself, when it really reaches your emotions and your heart. <BR>Trespass is one of the Genesis's best album, along with Foxtrot, Nursery, Selling and Lamb.<BR>In a way Trespass reaches the highest point of Genesis' pureness, creativity and greatness, there is what I consider one of the best progressive rock and  no prog rock album ever made. Beginning with Looking for someone, outstanding piece, deep meaning, sweet and hurting melodies, <BR> Stopping by Stagnation, which is an amazing song, great melodies, great words, the unique atmosphere that only Genesis and few other can give, Stagnation is a masterpiece, listen at it deeply an you'll agree with me, a poem of music.<BR>The knife is the ultimate porg rock song, wonderful hard melodies, screaming, an absolutely out of the ordinary Steve Hackett's guitar solo, you can listen at this album over and over for an entire life and never get sick of it.<BR>If I would be in a desert island and I would have the choice of having 10 albums to listen for the rest of my days I'd include Trespass with no doubts .<BR>I'm sorry for my English, I'm not a native and therefore not a perfect writer, hope you got the meaning though: Trespass: Music Masterpiece.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and now the movie.  The movie adheres to the book faithfully, and the characters are perfectly cast.  The scenes, costumes, and adventure all add up to great entertainment.  Every scene has so much detail and the director has wonderfully created the fantasy elements.  This is a great family film with good character role models.  Even though the story is about wizards and witches, it definitely does not enter into the demonic or satanistic<BR>realm but rather pure fantasy, like the Wizard of Oz.
B00000K19E|4.0|This DVD was a Christmas present for my husband and I was hesitant to watch it but was incredibly impressed by the effects. I have watched this movie over and over and never get tired of it. It is a dark movie(not for children!) and I would have liked the romance to be a little more developed but is a great movie. Anyone with a DVD player should have this in their collection.
0446677450|4.0|Financial Literacy is a part never taught in schools! The Rich Dad emphasis on Pg.46, his point of view that 'The poor and the middle class work for money - The rich have money work for them' In the opening chapter, Sharon Lechter is challenged by her son when she tells him 'If you don't graduate from college, you won't get good job and if no good job, how would you plan to get rich' The boy argues that he looks for new answers - Bill Gates or Michael Jordan never went to school yet they are Rich! And so it clicks to Sharon and Mike to realize their changing jobs which would never make them scale Richer as they expected. Getting impressed with the Cash flow of Robert, the book finds way into thoughts and actions covering up Lessons :<br />1. The rich don't work for money.<br />2. Why Teach Financial Literacy?<br />3. Mind your own business?<br />4. History of Taxes and power of corporations<br />5. The rich invent money<br />6. Work to learn - Don't work for money<br />The educated Dad's personal financial statement determines the life of someone in the rat race, his expenses seem to always keep up with his income never allowing him to invest whereas the logic to a Rich Dad's financial statement speaks of assets generating more income and re-investing after covering the expenses. Result is the Richer get richer. It's thoughts that concerns 'Taking risks and greed, a common attitude' that scales for higher earnings. The Book is not a Business Lesson but a thoughtfully written wisdom to come out of the 'rat race' and plan to be rich with the changing new waves. Right Book for every parent and all who dream to be Rich!
B00005JKJA|4.0|...I don't think everything is supposed to make sense, which if your a REAL Lynch-er should go without explanation. And what about the humor in the movie? I about exploded when I saw Billy Ray Cyrus laying in bed with Justin Theroux's wife. ... I remind you that Lost Highway at times was little more than Soft-Core Porn ala Cinemax. The reason I likehis movie is that it strips Hollywood of it's glossy veneer, showing that deep, dark,dirty underbelly that pushes it along. This movie will haunt you. I have to say, though, the absence of a chapter list REALLY [smells], but I guess I can deal with it.
B00005JKL8|4.0|...but it's a good stuff-blowing-up distraction for a Friday night. Watching Owen Wilson running, hiding, evading the enemy made me maddeningly tense. Yes, there were some awful lines, [bad] parts of the plot, etc. But I wasn't looking for the meaning of life here, just a good rental.  And I got my $[money] worth. Really, it was worth that just to hear Hackman yell \\"What the...is the problem???\\"  I also loved the landscape: creepy and desolate and more like a character in the movie than just a background.  <BR>One thing that baffled me: during the mass grave scene, there's a flashback (in black and white) of the mass killings, and right in the middle of it there's a tiny 2 or 3-second segment that came directly from the movie \\"The Savior\\" (great movie)when the main female character is about to be murdered.  I scanned all 107 reviews to see if anyone mentioned it, but nobody did. (I know, that's pretty pathetic, but I really wanted to know.)<BR>I would have liked more interaction between the Wilson and Hackman characters, but I was left pretty satisfied overall.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I first read about Norah Jones in an article about up and coming musicians.  If my memory serves, she was noted as the star to watch for.  Finally, after waiting for her album to appear in stores, I grabbed it.  Jazzy, bluesy, country,...whatever- this is a great album by a great singer/pianist.  Even her version of &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; is great.  The only disappointment was seeing that she didn't write most of the songs herself.  I'm sure that will come.  If you're looking for the next Diana Krall, you will be giving Ms. Jones a disservice.  She is an artist in her own right.<BR>Honestly, just look at most of the ratings of this cd.  Most of them are &quot;excellent&quot; while only a few are not.  Listen for yourself and you will not be let down.
0306801515|3.0|At times I was annoyed by Mr Gordon's style - this is the work of a real old-world engineer.  The little anecdotes he scatters through the work where so-and-so told him something, or it was rumoured that professor somebody said this, or 'I have heard it claimed that.....' annoyed me with their hearsay quality and lack of verifiability.<br />But then there are some very interesting discussions that do make the book an interesting introduction to engineering and the structure of things.  I just would have preferred if it read less like an engineer had written it!
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is great for men and women alike. Great plot with several twists and surprises. Wonderful ending.
0385484518|5.0|The first person to recommend this book to me was believe it or not, an old sociology professor of mine.  (If you read the book you may understand the irony).  I picked this book up one night and did not put it down- a few hours later I had read through one of the best books I have ever seen.<br />Tuesdays with Morrie is an awe inspiring novel about a young mans experiences with a dieing professor.  Morrie (the professor) uses his death as giving him the right to talk to everyone about things they would not normally talk about... and to pass on his theories about life to his favorite student.  Morrie slowly teaches Albom about what it means to live, versus what it means to live meaninglessly.  This book brings up many interesting points, some of which may make you think back on your life.  <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is an American classic in my opinion.  Albom writes this with honesty, and that takes braun.  Congratulations to him!

0151008116|5.0|This is the best new novel I have read in years.  It is completely refreshing.  In this novel there isn't a hint of cynicism or pessimism.  It is horrific and frightening, and yet optimistic in the most moving way.  The only part where the sometimes inflated ego that Mr Martel has exhibited in previous books shows through (and I write this with a smile on my face) is when he suggests that the story \\"will make you believe in God.\\"  Don't worry, it will not corrupt you into organized religion, be it Hinduism, Islam or Christianity, nor does it even try.  Yet, perhaps the key to the fascinating affect that this beautiful and horrifying work has is this rare (even unique!) underlying spirituality.  It is a book of symbols, which you at first believe are quite simple, slowly developing (like an avalanche) into complexity.  And yet when the story is over it becomes clear in a shocking instant that, all along, the symbols were even more simple and meaningful (in the most realistic sense) than you could have ever imagined.  I was mesmerized by this book and could not put it down.
B00005YXZH|3.0|It's seems especially hip to like this due to the heavy press it's gotten for not being released by their record comapny....<BR>Still a few good songs though. For my money the first Mermaid Avenue is the best work Wilco has done.
B00005YW4H|5.0|In reading some of the reviews, a lot of people came upon this cd with expectations of what genre Norah Jones would (should) fit. I had no notion what scope of diversity this cd had for me- and I gotta tell you I was FLOORED by the simple elegance of it. Her voice, arrangements and choice of covers impressed my need for torchlit harmonies. It doesn't fit a complete jazz category nor does it fall into folk category neither. But if there was one CD I recommended to those who love jazz and folk, telling them to leave their expectations open, this is it. I just let go of any pretense of what it should be and I have to tell you, it's a beautiful breeze of originality.
020530902X|5.0|I remember when I was 15 I was extremely into writing.  I was a published short stories writer who thought himself to be something extraordinary.  I thought I knew everything I needed to know about writing, plus more.<br />But after reading this book, I was wrong.  Elements of Style is written by one of the greatest of our generation.  Not only does it give punctual guidance, but it also tries to ease you through writers block, and other problems writers face.<br />All of the points it gives are true; guidelines that MUST be followed.  I was a good writer before reading this book, but now I must say I am a GREAT writer.  You can be too!  Just buy this book and you will get a hold of what writing is all about.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Actor Ian Mcdarmid has a somewhat cloud surrounding his character,Senator Palpatine. True viewers(fans)of the Star Wars movies learned a lot more from The Stars Wars Episode I,Phantom Menace. His deceiving intentions will be revealed some in Attack of the Clones,but everything of course will be revealed in Episode III. Amidala,Anakin/Vader,Luke&Leia,The identity of the Emperor(No Georgio did not tell me.)I have even seen the future remakes of the original three movies, all complete with modern technology and of course different actors with a very updated version of \\"Star Wars,The Empire Strikes Back,and The Return of the Jedi\\".I don't yet know of the actors bcause the writers are having a tough time with Episode III. I think that Episode Three might need to come out in more than a one part movie, they (Lucasfilms) may need at least a two part series to release. A good possibility could be Thanksgiving 2003 for Part I of episode III, and Christmas 2003,or New Years 2004 for the release of par two of Episode III. I have a lot more, but just like Episode III there is too much to tell and not nearly as much time as one would like. However if the powers that be, if they choose,I can write parts for them since I have a better understanding than anyone else except G, of course. I do have to say good bye for now and I to shall take a great interest in watching.

B000003BEM|4.0|Beggars Banquet mixes social rebellion themes with the Stones' country and blues sound, and comes through as one of their best studio albums.  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" embodies what the Stones seek to represent, and was significant at the time because it did so more as an apotheosis than as something that could merely be described as quintessential Stones.  Keith Richards' ripping guitar work and Mick's wicked lyrics stand as monuments to the rock and roll spirit.  The rousing \\"Street Fighting Man\\" is another classic, and the rich, sentimental \\"Salt of the Earth\\" is a wonderful working-class gem, more Old English than country in texture, as I see it.  Many of the remaining tracks, overall decent and with a lot of country and blues, are characterized by acoustic guitar overlays, but the best of these is the electric \\"Stray Cat Blues.\\"  Beggars Banquet represents the beginning of a period in the late '60s and early '70s of consistently solid studio album work for the Stones, who made such an important contribution to the popular culture during that time, the best ever for rock music and the counterculture/rebellious spirit.
0385493622|5.0|I know what you are thinking... a book about mathematics and its practitioners is probably as exciting as watching paint dry. But you would be wrong in this assumption. Simon Singh does a masterful job of describing the history of mathematics as an obsession, profession, and scholarly endeavor. Along with the quest by mathematicians to find a proof for the paradoxical equation known as Fermat's Last Theorem, the author gives fantastic information regarding math philosophy and the practical uses of theoretical mathematics (such as decoding messages by the Nazis in WWII).<br />I was so impressed with this book that I am attempting to do everything I can to get people to give it a look.  Lets face it a book about the history of a search for a mathematical proof is not exactly Tom Clancy material.... but I urge everyone to give this book a chance it is EXCELLENT!!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|There is only one song on this album which I find hard to tolerate. (City Love) The rest I could listen to for hours on end. I love his lyrics and his singing, which is, if you are also a die hard DMB fan, noticably different.
B000053VAF|3.0|If you just view the scenes that Metatron, &quot;Herald of the Almighty and the Voice of God&quot;, is in, the story is less murky. Dogma is irreverent (hooray!) and creative, but it would have benefitted from a more ruthless editor. Some of the scenes seem to be pointless digressions to provide a space for some low 7th grade humor. But if you concentrate on scenes with the testy seraphim, Metatron (superbly played by Alan Rickman), the film holds together really well and has a heart.
B000002U82|5.0|stunning-melodic guitar injections, screaming-insane vocals, purely blissful studio trickery, all toped off with these lyrics coming at you as if from some surreal plane of existence.  It rolls on and on with an inexorable flow that mirrors the passage of time which it reflects on.  Why do we live like we do?  Why do we spend time with &quot;friends&quot; we don't really like?  Why don't we follow our dreams?  Why are we marched off to war and why do we go?  Are we placated from our strongest ambitions by religion?  It's all here, if you listen.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World is a wonder of opposites. On one hand, we have little Sophie, and on the other, the wise old Albert (whose last name is still a mystery to me). We also have Sophie and Hilde, of whose identities I am still also confused upon. And overlying all this, is the great contrast between the simple, Little Prince-like story of Sophie and the expansive world of philosophy. <br />The story of Sophie, simple, easy to read and quite charming, manages, through tiny details, to display her wide-eyed wonder pefectly. This story, of how Sophie begins, continues, and eventually ends a history of philosophy, is woven with a much more complicated story of the actual philosophies she learns. The author tells this story nearly as clearly as he does Sophie's, and I find it easy to picture him as a well-loved professor in his homeland of Sweden. His descriptions of such a complicated history are clear enough so that he gets the reader to both understand the philosophies while allowing space to be able to contemplate and discover the many-faceted nature of this science. And, for a beginner in philosophy (as most people are when reading this book), this approach is the best. <br />Although the author overdoes the philosophy at times (the first few chapters can seem like reading a textbook), the descriptions and intrepretations of Kant, Socrates, Darwin, and Sartre are fascinating still. The book is long (just over 500 pages), and reading it in less than 10 sittings will be overwhelming. Also, the reader has to have a genuine interest in discovering new and different interpretations of ideas they may have already pondered and decided upon. The middle of the book is a complete mind boggler and hard to understand and comprehend. Once you do get it, though, Sophie's World becomes even more intriguing and fantastical.
078322608X|5.0|The movie rocks. An indie films on low budget with top actors in non-stereotypical performances that really show their range. The behind-the-scenes footage is top-notch, a student project that kept track of the making of the film from beginning to end, showing us how Gilliam got so stressed and the walls they hit.<br />I can't speak too highly of this film. If you liked Fight Club and you like Time Travel and/or Love Stories and/or Destiny/Twist of Fate stuff and/or Apocalyptic plague stories, BUY IT NOW. <br />...
B00003CXRP|4.0|Cast Away has some flaws, including having a somewhat weaker third act and over-marketing (if you saw the previews, you might already know the entire plot), however the film is lead by Tom Hanks through most of the film, and I think that if you took the entire second act of the film by itself, you have 5 star movie.<br />Tom Hanks plays a fed-ex man who is always obsessed with time, and over the Christmas break he has to leave his girlfriend to go to Asia.  But, on his way there on the plane, it crashes in the ocean and he winds up on a deserted island with hardly any food and inevitably no future.  All he can survive on is his primal instincts, lessons learned either from boy scouts or 2001 (the movie), or on a few fed-ex supplies.  To see Hanks like this on the island, doing things is amazing enough.  There is one scene in particular where he is creating fire that might be one of the best scenes by itself ever.  The way he shows his eyes, the way the camera shows the fire being made, the face, even the look on the face of his inanimate volleyball Wilson, is extraordinary.  Speaking of which, even though the volleyball which is named Wilson (intentionally, but possibly not) never speaks, it and Hanks give one of the best on-screen duo's in years.  The fact that he can communicate with this lifeless yet quirkily funny sport's object and make it entertaining in some ways similar to Jay and Silent Bob, is just one of the film's triumphs.<br />Overall, not only does Tom Hanks give the best performance of the year, he gives his second best performance of his career.  Bravo to him and every scene on the island for making such a compelling presence, even if the film isn't completely it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I first saw Spider-man on it's opening weekend and liked it so much, that last week I caught it for a second time. I also noticed a lot of things in the movie that I hadn't noticed. First, there's a very small part with Stan Lee, Spider-man's creator, in it. Also, since Sam Raimi directed this movie, and we all know and love him for the Evil Dead trilogy, Bruce Campbell, star of that trilogy, has a cameo as the announcer during the wrestling match, and you know anything with Bruce Campbell's name on it is quality. Even though I had seen this movie about a week earlier, I still enjoyed it as much as the first time. I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's just so cool and entertaining. There's definetly more of a human-factor in it than there was in the 90's cartoon, which I had watched a few times (and not enjoyed) in my younger years. Again, I think everyone should check out this movie. It has something for everyone. Oh by the way, just a note to the parents complaining about the \\"graphic violence\\" in this movie, I must remind you, this movie is rated PG-13, which means it is not intended for anyone under 13 to see. So don't bring your 6 year old kid and expect him to have a great time.
B0000640SA|5.0|...I pre-ordered the Limited Edition...Disc 2 allows a chronological option.  As you click through the menus, you'll be told to put a sequence of a woman changing her tire in order.  Put it in reverse order, and you will be treated to Memento played forward sequentially, starting with the credits rolling backwards and ending on the photo of Teddy's shooting.<br />You heard it here folks.  I don't care if you have the original release, buy this one before the first edition with the cool packaging gets snatched up.
630469797X|5.0|George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is, from where I stand, the most ambitious, creative, best horror film ever made; or at least the best horror film in the twentieth century.<br />It holds all the facets for a great character study piece- and it is somewhere inside a perfectly crafted zombie movie in creating a uniqye suspense and excitement alongside the gory and cartoonish carnage.  It also works as a satire, and having such a reach into other genres like that for a budget of this caliber is always a reasurring sign to me that movies like this are still around.<br />There is evidence, a good amount, to support the adulation.  The script itself gets praise in the terms of telling a coherent story.  And the script delivers such effectiveness in showcasing a parallel dimension deadland it could be on the basis of that alone to be one of the most original.<br />Not to say the ideas and themes on characters are the most original.  In Romero's first picture, Night of the Living Dead (Dawn's predecessor in a &quot;dead Trilogy&quot; with the third the mediocre Day of the Dead) displayed many of the key trademarks to be expected- characters getting tenser and a lot of internal combustion not only from getting crazed in a chillingly forboding precense, but as well the cannibalistic-instinct driven corpses.  The first debut of zombies in such a way was a smash in horro cult cultrue (deservedly so) and made Mr. Romero's reputation on sight.<br />The original part, however, comes in the form of transferrance- the key elements from &quot;Night&quot; are brought to an apocalyptic timewarp where muzak is a big chunk of the score.  Making the message of zombies encompassing a shopping mall isn't tough to connect to reality, but with its cleverness there's a place for endless opportunities for so many gags, drama-bits and shock for any writer and director to latch onto.<br />George grasps on to all of them.<br />Acting goes farther than expected, the score outside and sometimes inside the mall from the Goblins (and in the director's cut by Romero himself) is indeed impressive in heightening tension, and so on.  The one complaint here is in the DVD itself.  It has the essentials, the director's cut (superior to the 128 minute version) in widescreen and trailers, but there should've been more for a &quot;Collectors Edition&quot;.  Romero commented on the &quot;Night&quot; special edition DVD and doesn't here, nor are included any of the deleted footage that was shown in the German footage.  The Monroeville commercial spot on the other Dawn DVD isn't here either.<br />But those are feebles for the spoiled at DVD buyer heart; immortal moviemaking and acting all around, Dawn of the Dead is the plum of all plums in the horror world.inside the mall from the Goblins (and in the director's cut by Romero himself) is indeed impressive in heightening tension, and so on.

B00000K19E|2.0|Keanu Reeves plays an ordinary guy who is supposed to be the next savior of humanity.  Sounds corny doesn't it, but his movie actually takes itself very seriously.  'The Matrix' goes around preaching Eastern philosophy like it was its own original idea.  This was one of the worst lines; 'Maybe its not the spoon that is bending but your mind!!'  Whoa, such profound dialogue.  Too bad it was thought up 3000 years ago!!  Later on in the film a woman falls in love with Keanu because it was said she would fall in love with the CHOSEN ONE.  There are plenty of action sequences that go on forever; the worst is when the robots, who are supposed to be flawless, can't shoot the weak human beings.  Then at the end of the film there is some Rage Against The Machine music, just so the teenagers won't fall a sleep.
0385486804|5.0|I've read this book multiple times, and keep getting drawn back to it for reasons I can't quite explain. The book, an account of a young man by the name of Christopher McCandless taking numerous extended trips of self-discovery, which culminate into an early, unexpected death that leaves his friends and family bewildered and confused. The author, Jon Krakauer, gives vivid and meticulous details into the life of Chris and the many people that he touched on his plethora of trips. The book could be seen as a travel book of some sorts, or a book about the naivety of youth and the complex of indestructability that encompasses many of us--I say us for I am relatively young: 26. <br />Chris came from an affluent family, and a solid upbringing; he was well-educated and liked by most people who came in contact with him. But, as one of his few friends in the book states, \\"Chris was born into the wrong century.\\" Chris held Ideals that many people could not live by; and because of this fact, he had a problem with society in general. Chris graduates from college and promptly gives $25,000 to a charity, and embarks on a journey that will lead him to touch many, and confuse and hurt his parents. I encourage all to read this book numerous times, and try to judge Chris with an open-mind. He undoubtedly did some ignorant things, but in all he was in touch with a side of himself that few in our current society ever get a chance; most of us are so caught in the daily grind of life that simple things get lost in the shuffle: nature and beauty for examples. This book changed me for the better, and will no doubt change many more if they allow themselves to read with an open-mind.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best film behind Blood Simple, Fargo, Raising Arizona, and The Man Who Wasn't There.  The Coen Brothers have a pretty good film here, recommendable to say the least.  It is a good-natured odyssey inspired by the one by Homer, about 3 convicts (George Clooney looking like Clarke Gable, John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson) who escape the chain gang in 1930's south to go look for hidden treasure, even if there are distractions along the way.  Those include becoming blue-grass singers, John Goodman as the Cyclops and a trip of singing sirens on a river.  About the 4th best film in the ring of Coen bros. Films with some enjoyable, mesmerizing and ironic moments.  Definitely fun.
B00005JKCF|3.0|I went with my 4 year old grandson to see this movie. I realized it had a PG-13 rating but that isn't unusual in the more popular movies and he had seen movies rated at this level before. This movie was so havily marketed to young children, I thought it would be ok. I wish there had been a stronger warning as to the graphic violence at the end of the movie. It was hard to enjoy because my grandson was so upset. Television movies have a rating sytem that specifies the reason for the rating, perhaps it would be appropriate for movies to do the same.
0790731231|5.0|Martin Scorsese created his definitive masterpiece with this film.  GoodFellas has everything and anything I could for in a motion picture, and it is done so well with such enthusiasm, excellence and thought that it boggles the mind.  While it might be on a subject that might not be appealing to everyone, it is certainty worth viewing (I would even put it over the Godfather).<br />The film is about a kid in Brooklyn named Henry Hill, who grows up in the Mafia world not on the inside, but as an outsider looking in, who gets so intrigued by the way they act, the way they get away with anything, everything.  That leads Hill in becoming a bus boy, and then working his way up in the world.  How Scorsese deals with this material (brought from Nicholas Pillegi's novel which he co-scripted with the director) is different from other directors.  He handles it that the man knows the risks, but he doesn't care.  Just as long he can be different, not like other average people.<br />But this couldn't sustain the film alone.  It is elevated from exceptional acting by the whole cast: Ray Liotta in a fine breakthrough as the main character as a adult in his rise, and his eventual fall; Robert De Niro in a somewhat overrated yet good role as Jimmy Conway, one of 2 mentors of Hill with a bad attitude yet with charm; Joe Pesci, absolutely breathtaking with one of the most memorable scenes ever at the table telling his joke and being totally insane while still having the courtesy to have fun doing it (Pesci won the only Oscar for the film in America); Lorraine Bracco in also a great breakthrough as Henry's understanding yet angry wife (probably this is what got her noticed to co-star on the HBO show The Sopranos); and Paul Sorvino as the head mafia chieftain Paulie.<br />Acting helps this film immensely, and of course it is just one part of the film's greatness.  The photography is also awesome, with shots going into the copa cabana being fantastically mesmerizing and simple one's like the shot at the dinner table being simple; it is just another part of it.<br />Martin Scorsese has been able to top them all now.  With a story that is unconventional (much like life, for which it's based on), great acting, directing, writing, photography and jokes, this is a movie that was not seen like this before 1990, it astounded audiences (and still does), and nothing like it will ever some around again.the shot at the dinner table being simple; it is just another part of it.<br />Martin Scorsese has been able to top them all now.

B000002952|4.0|The listener could scarcely ask for a better Spanish language album.  Gloria's voice has a tendency to sound stifled on her heavily produced English records, but here her voice is set free through her natural and emotional Spanish.  The result is a passionate, warm record that dares you not to dance.  This is a fun introduction to Cuban music and very nice to listen to with friends.  Viva Cubita!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a shining castle. Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year. If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast..........<br />Disney's Beauty and The Beast is one of the best classics that Disney released in the 90's. It is the only animated movie in history to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. It tells the story of Belle, the most beautiful girl in town, dreaming of something more. Belle loves her father, more than anything else in the world. When he gets in trouble, Belle goes to save him and trades her freedom to the Beast in exchange for her father's release, and in here starts the romantic relationship between Belle and The Beast. But Gaston, who has been thinking of marrying Belle has other plans for her...<br />It's wonderful to hear that Disney is releasing Beauty and the Beast as their second movie from their platinum edition series. The Dvd features countless hours of Bonus features, as that of the previously released \\" Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs \\" , including 3 Enchanted Versions Of Film, Special Edition, Original Theatrical Edition, Work In Progress Edition, Audio Commentary, Sing-Along Track, Character Galleries, The Broadway Musical, Trailers & TV Spots and much much more!!! The movie itself contains a never-before-seen musical sequence, which is worth buying for!<br />All in all, this dvd will be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and if you dont have it, you're missing something.

038533558X|5.0|this is one great read!  Why? 1) Riveting. Really scary. 2) Plot just keeps twisting and turning. 3) Different. 4) Believable. 5) Cared about the outcome. Liked young Will a lot, and truly felt for his family.  <br />There are about ten mystery and suspense writers whose books I snatch up as soon as they're published, and Harlan Coben is now one of them.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|U-571 is a great American film that is taken too seriously.  Many people over look it because of the &quot;historical errors&quot; in it.  Nobody seems to be able to look past the factuality of it.  The way I viewed this film is without caring or taken too deep into thought of the historical background on the film.  <br />Everything was terrific about U-571, except for the pacing in the beginning.  The first half of the movie set it all up, but it took too long at times getting to the action.  Sure, the plot was important, but I just feel it dragged a bit at times.<br />The acting was fantastic.  Everyone in it did a great job.  I thought McConaughey had the best performance of his career.  Jonathan Mostow had a fantastic effort with the directing.  <br />And what can you say about the special effects?  They were awesome.  Everything looked very realistic.<br />U-571 is a great addition to the war genre. 5 Stars
0140186409|4.0|Between 1936 and 1938, Steinbeck wrote a series of newspaper articles for the San Francisco News and the Monterey Trader about the horrendous plight of the migrant workers in California, many of whom arrived from Oklahoma, Texas, and beyond, seeking work during the \\"Dust Bowl migration\\" of the 1930s. (Earlier, he had written and published a novel \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" about labor unrest among those same migrant workers.) The fruit of Steinbeck`s years mingling with these workers and investigating their conditions, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful and sympathetic fictional portrayal of one family's horrific odyssey across America in search of work after losing ownership of their farm.<br />There is certainly more than one way to read this novel: as an incendiary historical document that galvanized the country (Eleanor Roosevelt and various politicians took up the cause of the migrant workers, while conservative-leaning groups and towns banned--or burned--the book); as an epic about human perseverance, survival, and dignity (reflected symbolically in the much-maligned \\"turtle chapter\\"); as a political manifesto unflinching in its condemnation of the insensitivities of corporate capitalism (for which Steinbeck was accused of Communist sympathies). Readers who find the novel unrelentingly depressing or unrealistic in its portrayal of the Joad family's fate should understand that the Joads were actually quite lucky. (Very few migrant families, for example, were fortunate enough to live in government camps.)<br />The first hundred pages or so proceed rather slowly, in part because Steinbeck alternates the chapters about the Joad family with prosaic interludes describing the difficulties facing the migrant workers in general. But the pace of the novel accelerates (and the interludes become shorter), as various members of the Joad family experience frustration, sickness, brief periods of success, and death--never letting go of their dream of settling down somewhere and living in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable. (The two children are, well, just like children). The ending, which must have been scandalously shocking in the 1930s, is still electrifying; it forcefully shows the desperate lengths the poor were willing to go to help each other when most of America didn't care about their plight.<br />This is my second time reading the novel, and--although I again found it gripping and moving--I was not as impressed as the first time I read it two decades ago. (I was much more idealistic then, I suppose.) One of the novel's greatest weaknesses is that Steinbeck overstates the evil machinations of the \\"bad guys\\" and the good-natured intentions of the \\"good guys.\\" All the police and the bankers and the landowners are thoroughly malevolent; all the displaced migrant workers and the sharecroppers are faultless (or their shortcomings are unsophisticated, understandable, or well-meaning). As a result, the novel reads in a few places like agitprop rather than fiction.<br />Of course, that was Steinbeck's intent: he wanted to wake up the country. Yet, as a work of art, this style doesn't date well. Nevertheless, only a cynic or a monopolist could be unmoved by the story of the Joad family. It is truly a classic proletarian novel.ving in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable.

B000065VA1|5.0|SO is the Peters most commercially successful album to date.<br />Many of us think of Sledgehammer and Big Time with their incredibly creative videos and danceable beats and hilarious lyrics. While I love thoses songs a lot, this album offers more than just those two songs alone.<br />Where those two songs are very upbeat and funky the rest of So is dark, eerie and very atmospheric.<br />Red Rain the opening track is absolutely one of the most radiant tracks Gabriel has ever produced. The title track is absolutely perfect. If there was a video I think it should have been a scene of him walking on the city sidewalk when it's pouring rain and give the picture a red tint like red plastic wrapping placed over the eyes and at the ending of the song the red clouds break up and the sun comes out. Red Rain is an incredibly moving song, so moving it's almost like a one song soundtrack because of how lonely, and intense it is. I don't think Peter will ever top this song. It's that good. I love the way the keyboards sound.<br />The other song to point out is 'In Your Eyes'. I,ve heard how fans were upset that it wasn't included on the 1990 Shaking The Tree collection. I kind of wished it was included on that album but I at the same time think it wasn't a bad idea to leave it off so that this album could stay in print. The chanting at the ending is Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour. I at first thought it was a Native American chant but learned it was African. In fact when I listen to the song and the chanting towards the fadeout ending I definately have to say that it was a signal of Passion that would follow this album.<br />Don't Give Up is ambient/soul music with a truly meaningful message. I love the lyrics. They tell a story of someone who feels lost, hopeless, and all alone. The line \\"I am a man whose dreams have all deserted\\" touched me like no other lyrics in my life. I for one have gone through situations like this especially in high school. I wanted to be popular but my difference from many peers made me feel alone. This song has been a great song to enjoy. Few songs like this have such meaning like this one.<br />The last one I want to point is the sensual Mercy Street. It's an absolutely beautiful moody song. I believe that it was a tribute to the late Anne Sexton. The meellow, dark yet joyous melody makes this one of the most intriguing songs in Peters catalog.<br />There two mysterious songs at the ending called We Do What We're Told and This Is The Picture.<br />WDWWT is absolutely spooky with a disturbing guitar riff and strange breezy voice effects. The song then builds up with the sound of a chorus in the distance giving the song a feel of a parade of ghosts marching along a deserted suburban street on a foggy night.<br />This Is The Picture is an odd track that features a guest appearance by vocalist Lori Anderson. While I enjoy this song I have to admit that it doesn't rank on par with the rest of the album.<br />I do enjoy remastered editions of most album. Tears for Fears first three albums were re-released remastered and featured awesome bonus tracks.<br />Unfortunately I have to complain about how they re-issued this album. There are no bonus tracks and plus In Your Eyes was moved to the end of the album. The song was perfect placed at the middle of the album. No idea why they put at the endingPutting the chilling We Do What We're Told in it's new position diminishes the power of that powerful track. The same thing with This Is The Picture. The original lineup of the album tracks was perfect with In Your Eyes in the middle. I'm sure that Peter wanted So to end on a brighter more upbeat note wnd while I respect his opinion I must honestly say the So was absolutely perfect the way it was with In Your Eyes in the middle and the WDWWT & TITP at the ending. I actually thought that This Is The Picture ended So on a relatively upbeat note. I like the feel of the song with it making me think while I'm in the dark there is some light up ahead. So should have been left with it's original track lineup. I'm in the task of getting all of Peter Gabriels albums remastered but I refuse to replace my older copy of So. I like the album ending on a relatively dark note.<br />Another thing is that I find the digipak covering inferior to the jewel case version of the remastered catalog. I'm glad the digipak is limited because I truly believe the re-issuing could have been so much better if the limited edition had bonus material like B-Sides, remixes or demos. I like wtdk got the limited edition as a graduation gift and the covering hinges fell apart within a month.<br />A marvelous, provocitive album that was so badly handled in it's re-issue, So is absolutely one of the most artistically well crafted albums I have ever owned. It's so good I bet in 2086, 100 years after it's release it will still be available. I will be 104 in November of that year if I live long enough and I will still enjoy SO. This is one of those albums that will stand the test of time. Even the follow-up 1992s US will last a long time even though it doesn't quite rank as high.there is some light up ahead.

B00003CY0U|1.0|John Travolta's a kind of terrorist/illusionist/self-appointed \\"freedom fighter\\" who enlists the help of Hugh Jackman, not really reformed master hacker-criminal who'll try one last gambit (involving electronic bank theft) especially if it means a better life for his daughter who lives with his irresponsible ex-wife...and, I guess, it means that stolen money can be stashed away in secret cofers for future espionage.<BR>Judging by the grandiosity of Travolta's tricks and illusions (near the end he's able to engineer a bus air-lift with a fake double of himself) it's amazing that he's not rich enough to fund his own schemes.<BR>Halle Berry's role is highly predictable as the extremely sexy partner-in-crime who seduces Jackman into agreement. But she's not all s-e-x, she can outGOLF him! She's a *multi-talented* psychopath! We are supposed to admire this character!<BR>We are provided with two endings on the videocassette. The alternate is appalling - we are supposed to be impressed when Travolta and Berry ride off into the sunset, not the winners and nor the losers. What wild adventure is next for these happy travelers who leave mass destruction and chaos behind?
B00005JKEC|5.0|Denzel Washington has rarely been better than he is here. While many viewers and critics seem genuinely shocked at his transformation into an absolute monster, I kept thinking: didn't anyone else see the first half of &quot;Malcolm X&quot;? A decade ago, Washington bared his fangs to fine, frightening effect, in the first hour or so, of Spike Lee's epic, and while he later made the transition to good guy(and still paid with his life) the fury, violence, attitude and animalistic behavior was still there early on. &quot;Training Day&quot; is a brilliant, simple but effective film about the underbelly of law-enforcement and one young cop's refusal to comprimise his values, even at gunpoint. Ethan Hawke is terrific as Jake Hoyt and injects just the right amount of innocence, disbelief and decency into what could have been a one-note character, his Oscar nod was well deserved. Denzel won for a reason! He is having the time of his life being a bad**s in this film and it shows, this is scenery chewing of the highest order! His Alonzo Harris is the best crooked cop I've ever seen and Washington delivers every line as with lip-smacking relish, you simply can't take your eyes off of him.<br />&quot;Training Day&quot; is first rate urban entertainment that gets better with every viewing. Don't miss it.
B00005N9CV|3.0|This is a solid album of really great, popular numbers.  Diana can certainly be thanked for bringing jazz vocalists back in the spotlight.  She is a very competent musician and singer.  While she is not my favorite, she has certainly done a great service to the genre by bringing it to the commercial forefront.
B0000033OT|5.0|Anything by the late Donny Hathaway is highly reccomended, and this 1970 LP is among his best. The title track is a timeless, funky tune and starts things off in fine fashion. &quot;Thank You Master (For My Soul)&quot; is straight gospel but without the annoying histrionics that mar most spiritual-tinged music. This album is a fine example of Hathaway's restless, eclectic spirit as no 2 songs sound the same, but they all cohere into a very strong and moving whole. A Brilliant LP, by a brilliant and sorely missed musical genius.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I had never heard of this band from Calabasas.  I picked up the disc on a whim and was absolutely floored.  Tracks like &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; are phenomenal on every level.  It is rare to hear an album that is so well crafted, especially from such a young group of musicians.  I look forward to the next release with anticipation.  This is truly impressive.
0618001905|5.0|Hey... yes, I know he was not the nicest king around but he had good tactics.. He didn't know what was happening in the Congo... partly because he did not set foot there! I think this book is great reading to understand what happened in the Congo.. We do not know  everything about Belgium so, this is a good book to read.. too bad there are not that many books on that country here in the states. I love Belgium! :) Beautiful country.... but back to this book, if you want to learn about the Belgian Congo, then read this, it is written properly!

080013558X|5.0|I saw the play and I used to like the play better and was disappointed like others about certain songs being excluded but after watching this movie again after a few years I find myself actually liking the movie a little bit more than the play. The play was great but I just enjoy the movie more I think because Aileen Quinn's Annie is so full of spunk and I find her to be the definitive Annie and she was perfectly cast as Annie the tough little cookie with a heart of gold! I remember seeing the play and liking it and loving the songs but the movie just appeals to me more, I would rate this movie 5 stars and the play 4 1/2 stars but that's just my opinion.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I was introduced to Rammstein through Du Hast and later the Live in Berlin Video, which was visually incredible. Mutter is much better musically and has great pace. Ride the roller coaster from Links 2 3 4 to Sonne to Ich Will and Feuer Frei, slow down and ride slowly to the top with Mutter, then coast down again wildly with the brilliant Spieluhr, all the way to the sweet conclusion of Nebel. Try doing your fitness routine with this one!!!
B00004T9UF|2.0|Let's get one thing straight: I am not an Eminem hater.<br /> His rhyming skills are top-notch, his production professional.<br /> But his vocal delivery and lyrical depth I find to be lacking [and I am the target audience, by the way; I'm 16]. ....<BR> ....<br /> In fact, the rather common subject of anger and helplessness (felt by one) does not lend itself well to a full-length disc. ..., or...perhaps simply a keen awareness of who's buying the record and what they want to hear.<br /> The most accomplished track on this album is indeed \\"Stan\\", a haunting tale of a relationship gone awry and the perils of celebrity culture. It works so well, balanced with a sampling of Dido's \\"Thank You\\", and it is a minor classic.<br /> But the rest leaves something to be desired. There's Top 40 pap, like \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", which, while it has a wonderful hook, goes nowhere lyrically or musically. Eminem's nasal voice simply sounds loud and belligerent......and that's it.<br /> It's interesting to note that Eminem's album really serves no purpose: if you express anger as an artist, it helps to be constructive with it. Eminem offers no alternative to pessimism, no hope for change.<br /> But I'm not trying to preach. If you feel you'll be able to relate to his anger (and, I must admit, listening to this album when you're depressed does relieve stress), or if Eminem's music speaks to you, then this will prove an excellent buy.
080013558X|5.0|...It seems like so many people are saying that the 1999 Disney version was so much better than this one, which I don't understand. Yes, the 1999 film was very good, but this older version is so much better (in my opinion). .... In that respect, they did a great job with this movie. <br />Aileen Quinn IS Annie; she becomes the character both inside and out. When you watch her in this movie, it's pretty hard to imagine anyone else who could have done better. She's spunky, sweet, caring, and feisty--that's who Annie is, and that's what Aileen Quinn brought to the character. The singing was outstanding too--this is a great movie for children as well as adults....I've been watching it for as long as I can remember and I still love it. It's a classic! .......it's one of the best \\"Annie\\" versions out there, if not the best.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is a great family movie because it's cute and exciting. Pixar did a great job not only with this one but also with both Toy Story's- 1&2. I really enjoyed it and am excited for it when it comes out on movie. Enjoy!!
0451160916|5.0|King has written several fine novels, but The Shining is really his masterpiece.<br />Jack Torrance is the quintessential screw-up.  He just can't seem to get anything in his life on track  -  ever since he broke his infant son's arm, while on one of his many alcoholic benders.  Jack can't hold a job, what with the booze and his unmanageable temper.  And with all these problems, Jack can't concentrate sufficiently to write the play he's wanted to write for years.<br />Colorado's historic Overlook Hotel gives him just the chance he needs to redeem himself.  The hotel needs a caretaker through the winter months.  Jack could use the privacy for his writing, his wife Wendy looks forward to the cozy surroundings, and his son Danny has more than enough room to play in.  Neither Jack nor his family are concerned about the rumors that the Overlook is haunted  -  or that the former caretaker, Mr. Grady, went mad and bashed his wife and children to death with a roque mallet.<br />No, they're not concerned  -  but they should be.  Because little Danny has an unusual psychic power, a special \\"shine\\" to him.  The kind of power that could manifest the Overlook's many violently-demised ghosts back into the world, to wreak even more mayhem than they did when they were alive, if they could just kill Danny so they could use it.  But with someone as emotionally unstable as Jack spending the winter with them, the disturbed spirits have hands to make that job just a little bit easier...<br />The only flaw with this great novel is an occasional tendency to go over-the-top, but King does that far less here than in most of his other books, and not sufficiently for it to become a nuisance.  His writing is in peak form, and these are among the best and most realistic characters he's ever written.  The plot and the suspense never flag, building relentlessly.<br />There are fewer than a handful of great ghost stories written in this century, but this is one of them.  If you've never read a King book in your life, but want to see what all the hoopla is about him, this is the one you want to read.  Don't miss it.  And don't assume it's at all like the Stanley Kubrick movie, because they're worlds apart.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This is a wonderfull adventure for children and grown-ups; I don't think I would like to have missed it -- it's one of those historic moments in film history where you can feel a rush -- like when you saw Ben Hur for the first time.<BR>  In a way I was looking for fault's, because a picture so much praised, HAD to have some bad moments, right? Wrong! There's no such thing. It's perfect from start to end.<BR>  Wonderfully directed by Chris Colombus and with the best of the best british actors it just keeps on rolling. The phrase &quot;Never a dull moment&quot; takes on a whole new meaning -- and the magnificent J.K. Rawling's creation -- is stunning and -- beatifull? Yes, beatifull.<BR>  It's a wonderfull fairy tale. And I should know. I'm from Denmark, like H.C. Andersen :)
B00005YXZH|2.0|I greatly anticipated the release of this album. I totally fell in love with Summerteeth. It seemed Jeff Tweedy was on the top of his game. But with this outing, it seems Tweedy has forsaken listenabilty in favor of distorted guitar feedback,white noise, and studio loops, etc... I feel it was overdone, and it took away from what could have been there best album yet.

B00003CX5P|1.0|I must say I'm no Star wars die-hard fan. I like the old trilogy, it reminds me of my childhood and I think they are good examples of good entertainment films.<BR>However, I think 'The Phantom menace' is a horrible film. I just think Lucas should have left the legendary trilogy as it was, but since he decided to make new episodes, at least he could have done it better.<BR>The phantom menace is very bad, in my opinion: the actor's interpretations is simply absent (how can an actor transmit credible expressions talking to a blue screen, talking to no-one?), the so worshipped effects are nothing to me: many people love computer effects, but I just think they're too obvious. When I see the old films, ok the effects are old-fashioned today but I believe what i see: now, I only see computer images: they're so obvious, I feel I'm seeing a cartoon and not real images. The evil character has the personality of an egg. There's the most upsetting and hateful character ever made, a guy with elephant-ears and simply unlistenable voice. And there's a race scene which gets more and more boring. and... is there a story?<BR>In conclusion, my opinion is that this film is almost ridiculous. I have already seen Episode II and it's quite better, though I still think some of the horrible aspects of I are still present in II.
B00005JKJA|3.0|David Lynch can't tell a straight story, if you pardon the pun.  I don't mind time-bending storylines (&quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Memento&quot;) but they have to have an underlying, live plot, as opposed to images, mood and style.  And the film was too long and too self-involved.  What do I mean by self-involved?  I'm tired of books about authors (&quot;Wonderboys&quot;), plays about stage performers (&quot;Noises Off&quot;), songs about musicians (&quot;Faithfully&quot;) and most of all, films about actors.  Quit getting off on yourselves for once.  Why three stars?  Because Lynch is Lynch.  Who else could give you characters like the Cowboy and the Incompetent Hitman?  Even I recognize genius.
0399103422|5.0|Certainly just as wonderful as the movie, The Godfather is a true classic that you haven't lived until you've read, up there with Grapes of Wrath, Harry Potter, etc. It mixes dark and violent themes that show beautifully the cruel and sad world of the Mafia. Mario Puzo shows with skill the horror of this organized crime and makes you understand the truth of this underground terror. A classic just like the movie.
6301777387|3.0|I don't know how it happened, but somehow I never saw this film, nor did I ever see any of the television episodes which were based on it.  Of course, I had heard of MASH though and was looking forward to this video of the original 1969 screenplay. I expected to enjoy it completely.  WRONG!<br />Directed by Robert Altman, the screenplay was written by Ring Lardner Jr., adapted from the novel by Richard Hooker. It takes place in a medical facility during the Korean War and shows doctors working with war victims, saving lives daily in a primitive operating room. It's a comedy though, and everything is exaggerated, from the extraordinary amount of blood in the operating room scenes to the practical jokes these doctors play. They are often covered in blood and some of the scenes are not for the squeamish as they wisecrack and flirt and oppose military authority throughout, drinking and drugging and romping with the bimbo nurses.  It's all is supposed to be great fun.<br />Donald Sutherland plays Hawkeye and Elliott Gould plays trapper.  They are both surgeons who use every bit of their spare time partying.  Robert Duvall is also a surgeon but he sprouts dogmatic religious philosophy and blames others for his mistakes. Early on, he's eliminated after a practical joke that makes him and the head nurse, played by Sally Kellerman, the laughing stock of the company.  In one of the overlapping stories, the men cure a potential suicide victim who questions his manhood by letting a nurse use her body to cure him of his delusion.  And then there's a football game in which the MASH team wins by cheating.<br />I know this is all supposed to really be about the stupidity of the Vietnam War.  It's supposed to make us sympathize and identify with the hard-working doctors who have to put up with petty military rules.  It's supposed to be funny.  I even cracked a smile or two.  But I didn't laugh when they humiliated a nurse by exposing her nakedness while taking a shower.  I didn't laugh when the decision to commit suicide seemed an all-right solution for someone who thought he was gay.  I didn't laugh when the MASH team won the football game because they used hypodermic needles on the opposing team.  Instead, I raised an eyebrow and wondered about the mindset of people in 1969 -- when it was funny to see women as mindless, gay people has having to be cured, and drugs the answer to every question.  I, myself, would have thought it was funny then.  I don't now.<br />I can't really give MASH a bad recommendation.  After all, it was a classic in its time.  The acting was excellent, the timing of the jokes perfect.  And it certainly captured the absurdity of war.  It's an interesting historical study of America then.  And it's worth seeing for that alone.  But then was then.  And now is now.  I just can't help it if it's 2002.ugh when the decision to commit suicide seemed an all-right solution for someone who thought he was gay.

B000063V8S|5.0|Fourth season is a strong contender for best season of the entire series. Perhaps what is most admirable about this season is that it is probably the most consistent of them all; while there are many excellent episodes, there are very few which scrape the bottom of the barrel.<br />While I've noticed that some people have individually summarized the entire season I have neither the time nor inclination to do anything that in-depth. Instead I will pick out some of the highlights and briefly mention them.<br />Season three ended with what many Trekkers would consider to be the best episode of all time (of any of the five series').The Best of Both Worlds was a monolithic episode that exemplified everything that was good about the series. There was strong acting galore (Stewart and Frakes both turn in great performances), wonderful special effects, and a great villain (the Borg). Indeed, The Best of Both Worlds was a cliffhanger in the true sense of the word; it created a genuine sense of urgency within virtually any viewer. There is one particular scene that always stands out for me: The Enterprise has earned a brief reprieve from the relentless Borg by hding in a nebula. Picard, like a forlorn Captain takes what seems like a final tour of the ship before resuming the hopeless battle. He goes to ten forward, the ship's bar and quitly dispenses one of the most brilliant bits of writing Star Trek has ever seen (\\"will this be the end of our civilation?... Turn the page\\").<br />Although they could have easily ruined the second part, thankfully they didn't. Part 2, season 4's opener is almost as good as the first and features some equally brillaint moments (sailing through the debris field at Wolf 359, the \\"Data; SLEEP\\" first contact). A brilliant conclsuion to the best two parter in TV history.<br />The season rolls along swiftly and along has many great moments along the way. \\"Brothers\\" is undoubtedly a highpoint for Brent Spiner's acting career as he juggles the roles ofthe quiet Data, the evil Lore, and the enigmatic creator of the two Dr Sung.<BR>\\"The Wounded\\" features a nice cameo by Shawshank's Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) as a distraught Captain who goes renegade. \\"Clues\\" is a cleverly staged mystery that never seems to feel tired (no matter how many times I see it on TNN). \\"The Mind's Eye\\" has Levar Burton's best performance of the season, an assassination plot, and Picard swearing in Klingon all wrapped nicely into fifty-some minutes. \\"Reunion\\" is both touching and thrilling as it cleverly introduces the Klingon civil war angle that the series frequently alludes to over the following three years.<BR>Then there's the wonderful \\"Nth Degree\\" that inverts the role of Brocolli (Barclay), the bed-wetter, into a man of great intelligence, only for him to take the crew on a trip to the center of the galaxy.<br />Perhpas best of all is \\"The Drumhead.\\" I hated this episode when I was growing up because it seemed to be completely lacking in everything that the show tried to explore (funny aliens, good space battles). However, after repeated viewings, this episode shows itself to be a true gem as it brilliantly explores the notion of McCarthyism in a seemingly Utopian world. <BR>There are some brilliant speeches by Picard and a wonderful cameo by the woman playing Nora Satti (forget her name). \\"I've brought down bigger men than you Picard!\\" - Does TV acting get any better. <br />I see this episode and realize this is why none of the later Trek series's ever worked as well; they simply did not have either the acting or the writing. Voyager could only dream of having scenes this good.<br />Of course there are other winners, \\"The First Duty\\" being a notable one.<br />There are the some bad moments as to be expected. At this point I think every fan was hoping that Lwaxanna would die in a shuttle accident, and if not \\"Half a Life\\" certainly did them in.<BR>\\"First Contact\\" is mediocre and makes me laugh to think that it is Frasier's icy cold Lilith who wants Riker. Still, who cares?<br />Brilliant
630310696X|5.0|This 1993 film was the first major Hollywood movie with big name stars to deal with the topic of AIDS.  As of now, with the exception of some independent films as well as some programs on television, it is the only one I know of.  I don't know how it did at the box office but it did win a lot of awards and recognition, especially for Tom Hanks, who won an Academy Award for best actor.<br />Cast in the role of a lawyer in a prestigious Philadelphia law firm who is fired because he has AIDS, Hanks really took on the role wholeheartedly.  He must have dieted to starvation because his weight loss is quite noticeable and with the aid of good makeup, we see his physical appearance change before our eyes.  Denzel Washington is cast as a lawyer too, but he works independently, taking on small cases of personal injury, even advertising his services on television.  He's happily married with a wife and small baby and hates homosexuals.  However, in spite of his feelings, he takes on Hanks' case, never completely giving up his negative feelings towards gays, but yet understanding his client's very human feelings about wanting to live.<br />Joanne Woodward is cast as Hanks' mother and, even though her role is small, there are some very moving moments between them. Jason Robards is the partner in the law firm who expresses disgust at the fact that Hanks had the nerve to bring AIDS right into their office.  Mary Steenburgen is the attorney for the law firm and she does an excellent job of very clearly bringing out some of the legal issues.  And Antonio Bandaras is cast as Hanks' partner who has the unpleasant tasks of helping Hanks with his treatments.  The whole cast does an excellent job.  Every person seemed absolutely real under Jonathan Demme's very capable direction.<br />Mostly the film involved itself with the legal issues and this kept it from being maudlin.  However, there was no way it could help bringing out the very human story behind the courtroom drama.  It's a story that had to be told to the world.  And \\"Philadelphia\\" does an excellent job of doing just that.  Recommended.y that had to be told to the world.  And \\"Philadelphia\\" does an excellent job of doing just that.  Recommended.
B000063V8T|5.0|At this point in the series the show had been running smoothly for several years and had built up a serious following. Thus, the result is a season with consistently solid writing, the usual high standard of acting and some wonderfully innovative special effects pices (no longer does the viewer sit there cursing tyhe series for not having a bigger budget like seasons 1 and 2).<BR>Arguably fifth season was the apex of the series, where everything was running smoothly and week after week the show was churning out classics. Whie I personally don't believe this is the best year (I prefer season 3,4 and 6), fifth season has many episodes which rank in any Trekkers top twenty (sadly I have one).<br />Redemption II opens things with a relative bang and thankfully puts to an end the lengthy Klingon civil war saga. Warf's family name is cleared and he rejoins the crew of the Enterprise (I think everyone knew this would happen anyway).<br />Darmok, the season's second episode is undoubtedly one of the show's best moments. Patrick Stewart turns in a virtuso performance alongside Paul Winfield (remember him in Terminator?). Some of the season's other high points are, Cause and Effect in which the Enterprise gets caught in a time loop only to find Frasier at the other end, The Game, a Wesley Crusher comeback special, I Borg, an exploration in humanity with a lone Borg, and The Next Phase, arguably Geordi's best episode to himself (Booby Trap is up there). <br />Then we have the peabody winning 'The Inner Light' which is certainly one of the show's most touching and well written episodes.<br />Unfortunately there are a few episodes that suffer from the old \\"Shakka when the walls fell syndrome\\" ... The Masterpiece Society is as banal as any episode and Violation is another clunker but these are only minor bumps int he road.<br />A fine effort of a season with an intelligent and savvy cliffhanger.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Director Sam Raimi has done a superb job in bringing a beloved comic book character to life in \\"Spider-Man.\\" In the film Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, a New York City high school senior. An unpopular nerd, Peter is bitten by a mutant spider and soon develops spider-like super powers: the ability to climb up walls, shoot webs from his wrists, etc. Adopting the superhero identity of Spider-Man, Peter ultimately must battle a deranged criminal known as the Green Goblin.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" succeeds on many levels. First of all, Maguire is superb in the pivotal title role. He is a vulnerable and likeable hero for whom the audience can really cheer. The rest of the cast is right up to Maguire's high standards. Kirsten Dunst, as the girl loved by Peter, has a sweet, tender chemistry with Maguire; the romance is believable and well balanced with the other story elements.<br />The special effects and action sequences really sent chills up my back. But the effects never overwhelm the film; they are always in the service of story and character development. The well-paced script has plenty of excitement and just the right amount of witty humor (the first appearance of Spider-Man in costume is a particular gem of a sequence). Maguire brings a real sense of wonder and joy to his scenes as Peter discovers and explores his new abilities.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" is very much this character's origin story. In a symbolic sense, this is a coming-of-age story about the passage from boyhood to young manhood; it is about forming bonds of love and friendship, about relating to one's family, and about developing a personal core of ethics and values. Thus, the story is not just a thrilling popcorn flick, but is resonant on other levels. \\"Spider-Man\\" is one summer blockbuster that both satisfies and leaves you hungry for a sequel.

B00003CXB2|5.0|The old expression that the book is always better than the movie is oh! so true!  The less you know about T. E. Lawrence, the more enjoyable this movie is.  Unfortunately, I have recently been reading both about Lawrence (both biographies about him as well as his own masterpiece, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM).  There is always controversy regarding the extent to which the accuracy of the presentation of a historical figure should impact one's assessment of a work of art.  Unfortunately, I did find myself enjoying this film vastly less on a reviewing of it after actually knowing something about the subject matter.<br />Even after having looked somewhat into Lawrence's life, there are many things to laud in the movie.  It is unquestionably one of the most beautiful films ever made, with inconceivably gorgeous cinematography, one of the great musical scores in movie history, and one magnificently epic vista after another.  In no movie is the desert as beautiful and as alluring as in this one (just as Lawrence's own SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM is the great paean to the desert, excepting only Charles Doughty's great classic TRAVELS IN DESERTA ARABIA, which Lawrence took as his literary model).  And while there are some unfortunate casting decisions (at this point in history, one is always disappointed to see non-Arabs playing major Arab roles), Peter O'Toole dominates the screen in every shot in which he appears, with the most piercing blue eyes one can remember.  He is perhaps a tad too good-looking.  One is reminded of Noel Coward's quip to O'Toole, \\"If you'd been any prettier, it would have been Florence of Arabia.\\"<br />But if you have read about Lawrence or read Lawrence's own book, certain things will disappoint on a reviewing.  First, one is disappointed by the presentation of Lawrence himself.  Although Peter O'Toole is unbelievably charismatic as Lawrence, he is on physical grounds terribly unqualified for the role.  One of the central factors in Lawrence's life was his height:  he was so short he had enormous difficulty getting into the military, only managing it after several high level friends pulled strings for him.  Great care was taken to disguise Lawrence's height, but the guess is that he was between 5'3 and 5'6, and probably towards the shorter figure.  O'Toole is a long, lean 6'3.  Despite some rough physical resemblance, O'Toole's height seriously hurts his ability to portray Lawrence accurately.<br />I was also somewhat disappointed, upon reviewing, that the gigantic complexity of Lawrence's personality was not better reflected onscreen.  This is probably inevitable.  Lawrence was easily one of the most complex personalities of the 20th century.  Even after having read a pair of biographies, I feel that I know next to nothing about him.  His feelings about the Arabs, his attitudes towards the conflict he was involved in, his goals for himself in the Arab peninsula after the conflict, his masochistic asexuality (he deplored being physically touched by any human being, male or female, yet took delight in his ability to absorb enormous physical brutality, sometimes asking people to beat him with their fists in later life), and, perhaps most of all, his strange relationship to his own fame.  After the Arab conflict, he retreated first into the RAF and then into the Army as anonymous private under a fictitious name (in the army becoming Private T. E. Shaw, the \\"Shaw\\" homage to his friend Charlotte Shaw, wife of George Bernard).<br />The movie also contains many historical inaccuracies, but this is more forgivable in that Lawrence's own book contains perhaps even more inaccuracies.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it contains many embellishments and exaggerations.<br />Still, this is a great movie.  If you don't know much about Lawrence, see the movie before learning more about him.  You'll love the movie a great deal more if you do.height:  he was so short he had enormous difficulty getting into the military, only managing it after several high level friends pulled strings for him.  Great care was taken to disguise Lawrence's height, but the guess is that he was between 5'3 and 5'6, and probably towards the shorter figure.  O'Toole is a long, lean 6'3.  Despite some rough physical resemblance, O'Toole's height seriously hurts his ability to portray Lawrence accurately.  <br />I was also somewhat disappointed, upon reviewing, that the gigantic complexity of Lawrence's personality was not better reflected onscreen.  This is probably inevitable.  Lawrence was easily one of the most complex personalities of the 20th century.

B000063Y8F|5.0|Wow! I just used my Rosle garlic press for the first time today. I cant believe how easily the unpeeled garlic went right through the holes. One good squeeze was all it took, the garlic almost squirted out. All that was left inside the press were the skins. This is a beautiful piece of engineering, made of heavy duty stainless steel. It seems to be a very durable kitchen tool. A breeze to wash, the garlic rinsed off easily under running water.<BR> <br />This item is a little expensive but I feel like it was worth the price. After fighting with inferior presses for many years, I finally found a great one. I like the Rosle garlic press so much I just ordered three more, one for each of my children.
B0000668IF|5.0|Maybe MOBY is a rocket scientist after all...we ARE all made of stars.  Fact is all the elements in our bodies originated in stars (fusion you know).  But to the music...<br />It's a great album, give it a little time and you'll be playing it over and over again.  I love Play, and this one is a bit more laid back (at least at first).  I'm starting to think I even like this one more as I listen to it!  Buy the CD, decide for yourself.....
B00004W5UA|5.0|Fight Club, in the famous lines, First rule of Fight Club : No one speaks about fight club!!<BR>This film i thought would be an action film as the name suggests so. But that couldn't be further from the truth. This film on a visual and 2 dimensial face is entertaining and moves on quickly enough so that you don't get bored.<BR>On a deeper level it has mesages about soical and economic life in america. <BR>this is a thoroughly entertaining film, especially when you watch it with your girlfriend!!!
B0000668IF|2.0|I can't believe the same man who made \\"Everything Is Wrong\\" and \\"Play\\" could release an album this bad. Even though \\"Play\\" crossed Moby over to the MTV mainstream with tracks like \\"Southside\\", it was still original and a great album. This album is not original or great. The tracks are short, uninspired, pop disasters that should never have been tagged to Moby's previously clean slate. The tracks are very similar. Do you remember on \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\" where the initial vocal sample had that kind of live, sampled feel to it? Moby tried to replicate that sound over this full album. Even though that sounds very appealing at first, let me assure you it is not. The sequence almost every track runs on is <BR>vox sample -> drum beat -> synth -> modifies vocal sample/new sample -> lead out<BR>great, huh? \\"Bodyrock\\" was one thing, but I cannot stand \\"Jam For The Ladies\\". While \\"vocal songs\\" worked on \\"Play\\", they fail miserably on this album (\\"Rafters\\", \\"Extreme Ways\\", etc.) yeah, so this is not up to Moby standards. If you are a newbie to Moby, go with \\"Play\\" or \\"Everything Is Wrong\\".
B00004VVNC|5.0|Legend of the Falls in a movie about how a family deals with a devasting tragedy. <br />The movie starts off with Samuel (the youngest brother) coming back home with his finacee, Susannah. Susannah gets used Samuel's family, and his home life. Samuel's brothers, Alfred and Tristian, are captivated by Susannah's beauty and her spirit. <br />Samuel wants to help the cause of the war. He wants to fight, and so to protect him, Tristian and Alfred fight in the war, too. One day while action is going on, Alfred is injured, and Samuel goes off alone thinking that he can take the enemy alone. What happens is tragic: Samuel is attack by a poisionus gas, and he cannot see. Tristian is own his way, and before he can rescue Samuel, the enemy shoots Samuel. Tristian kills the enemy that has shot Samuel, and Samuel dies right in his arms. ]<br />From there, Tristian, Alfred, Susannah, and Tristian, Alfred, and Samuel's father lives changed forever after the death of Samuel. Trisitan is never the same because he feels responsible for Samuel's death. He feels like he didn't get there on time to save his life, or he wasn't watching out for him like he should. Susannah is lost and confused, and she moves on to Tristian seeing him as the next best thing to Samuel or even more. When Tristian leaves for the second time because he still have problems cooping with what happened to Samuel, she marries Alfred who is love with Susannah, but she is not in love with him. <br />A family that goes through hardships, that is broken by the bonds of losing the ones that they love, their spirit will  be tested fully to see if the bonds are tight as they should be, Legend of the Falls, is a play one words. Legends do have falls, but when people fall they get back up and try again which make them much stronger.
B000002U82|5.0|I had this album upon release and played the vinyl until it wore out. Any serious music collector who does not own a copy is not a collector. Turned my dad into a fan. Check out the interviews filmed during Live at Pompeii to hear the original takes and studio tracks from this groundbreaking album and band.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United Stateds of America was suddemnly and deliberatly attacked by the empire of Japan...FDR. After watching this movie i feel so patriotic and rejuvennated with american pride. The spectacular screenplay based on the novel by the astouding author Randall Wallace was a wonderfully written epic tale of love, war, and betrayel. The special effects are precise and the realizism is extremely accurate. The costumes were a fabulous replication of the 1940s clothing. The movie was filled memorable characters. Every single line in the movie is perfectly placed. \\"That's no navy issued uniform\\" -Gooze. \\"Every night as I look into the sunset, I draw the last ounce of heat from its long day, and send it from my heart to yours\\"-Evelyne.<BR>But the best part of all: there are two incredibly gorgeous tall dark handsome guys! Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck are hott!!
B000002WFF|4.0|That's The Way It Is represents one of Elvis' best albums from the 1970's. It is a mixture of live recordings and studio mixes. But it should not be confused with the original soundtrack from the documentary of the same name that is different. Elvis sings every song with feeling and really puts his heart into the music. It is a good record (CD) throughout. And while I would not put it in the top 5 of his greatest albums, it would certainly be in his top 10 - a record that is well worth owning and listening to. <br /> Where Elvis really sores on this album is on the live tracks. \\"Patch It Up\\" written by the late, great, Eddie Rabbit is an up tempo pop song that Elvis sings to the hilt and the band plays hard. His version of \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\\" is probably the best remake of the Righteous Brothers classic that I have ever heard. It's different in sound than the masterful original but like that version, it is very soulful. Elvis gets inside the song and jokes in this live version, \\"Baby, Baby I'd get down on my knees to you, If this suit wasn't too tight.\\" He was slender at the time and his good humor serves for comic relief, amidst the seriousness of a man looking for a second chance with his woman. <br /> The other outstanding performance on this album is \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\". To equal the original classic, once voted the greatest song of the 1970's, is no easy task. But in this version Elvis does just that. Masterfully reflecting the eloquent lyrics, he sings them with both drama and panache. His voice soars, the back-up singers voices soar and Elvis leaves his listeners wasted. It's light opera, it's pop, it's musical theater all rolled up into one and it represents one of Elvis' best and most powerful ballads from the 1970's. It's no coincidence that this song was a staple in his live concerts throughout that decade. <br /> Coming close to this brilliant performance is \\"I've Lost You\\". This is a beautifully written piece of adult contemporarypop describing a marriage where love and chemistry have disappeared and a child is involved. The lyrics are sad and the orchestration is thoughtful. Yet Elvis performs it with such exhuberance; he almost sounds happy. Perhaps it was  the joy of singing to a live audience coming through. (The studio version of this song better reflects the lyrics.) Whatever the reasons for Elvis' jubilation on the track, it represents one of those little paradoxes that he was famous for with those who knew him best. Nevertheless, it's still a  gem of a song.<BR> <BR> If you're a guy and you buy this album, invite your girlfriend over to listen to it. By the time it finishes she just might like you even more than she did before.  If you're a lady and you buy this album; when you're done listening to it, you'll probably wish you had dated Elvis.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I really wanted to like this film, but as happens in about half of his films, David Lynch gets too frustrating/confusing for me.<br />On the plus side, the entire film features great cinematography, and the first half of the film builds a storyline that keeps my interest.<br />Sadly, the second half of the film self-destructs in a ball of confusion that makes the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey seem clear in comparison.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I've read all the reviews listed here and have to say that if you like fluff semi-jazz rock pablum, this is the album for you.  Wake up people there are some fantastic groups and guitarists/singers/songwriters out there that would just blow John Mayer off the stage.  To answer the next question, yes I do posess a quality bootleg of John in concert. It is just a re-do of his album, very little jamming and attempts to expand the songs in a live setting.  To even compare him to the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughn, Dave Matthews, Seal etc. is insulting to these artists.   Want to hear some great guitarists?  check out Derek Trucks, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Warren Haynes, Jimmy Herring, Paul Barrere of Little Feat, Stevie Ray and then if you want to hear some great jazz listen to John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter to name a few.   Once you appreciate the genius these artists posess you will realize this is jazz rock lite 101.  I have listened to this album numerous times trying very hard to like it and all I can say is the kid has some basic talent that I hope he will work hard to develop and then maybe we will hear an album of a mature artist who doesn't write songs that all sound the same with basically inane self-centered lyrics and that he makes an effort to use his talent to grow and expand his musical horizons.<BR>As a last note, what the hell does being cute or good looking have to do with the music?  Please shed the brain washing that MTV has apparently afflicted you with and realize the physical appearance of an artist has absolutely NOTHING to do with that artist's musical talent.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I have all 4 enigmas, and i would have to say this is the best one.  Its the most futuristic.  The one thing I like most about it is that Its difficult to become tired of it.  I dont think of any other way that it could have been better.  There are many tracks, and all the songs are long.  Gravity of Love is probably the best followed by t.n.t for the brain.  I would give this cd 6 out of 5 stars, but I cant.  So buy it, dont burn it, the quality is great, and its worth every penny...

0452282152|5.0|I LOVED this book! I finished it in three days and I?m a slow reader. I was surprised that a novel set during the 1660s in Holland could hold any interest for me, but I couldn?t put it down.<br />What I like most is how the story exemplifies the modus operandi of a true artist: His greatest passion is his art, which can be difficult for regular people to fully comprehend. For that artistic passion to be more important than anything else, can be heartbreaking for a young girl such as Griet. Maybe it?s because I?m an artist myself, went to art school, have been surrounded by artists for so many years, that I could appreciate this novel, because so much of it is true when applied to real life. However, I think anyone will fall in love with this book.<br />I also loved the way Chevalier described the way Vermeer saw the world, what set his vision apart from the people around him. The way he taught his vision to Griet was beautiful. It was wonderful to see how Griet slowly understood the complexities in the colors of our world?she seemed perceptive beyond her years, or just one of the few people in town who could understand, and Vermeer saw this in her from the beginning.<br />Of course the love triangle in the novel was terrific. All the drama within the Vermeer family, their patrons and friends, and the local butcher?s son, was completely irresistible! However, it wasn?t like a soap opera by any means. Every character was complicated, everyone had their assets and flaws, which made this story all the more emotional. I was just sucked in!<br />There were so many aspects to this story, so many interesting issues going on: Such as Cornelia, one of the Vermeer children who was determined to bring Griet to shame. The unwavering love that Pietre the son had for Griet, Maria Thins who masterminded the business, and of course, Griet?s own transformation from an innocent child to a young woman, with all the confusion, frustration, discoveries and heartbreaks that came with it. Simply written, but filled with forshadowing and symbolic acts, this book, to me, is a work of art to be remembered.Simply written, but filled with forshadowing and symbolic acts, this book, to me, is a work of art to be remembered.
B000002MTU|5.0|When I heard Eric plays Hoochie Coochie Man I was hooked - there is nothing to discuss this CD is must to any Blue lover and Eric Clapton fan - who's not right? :) SO stop wasting your money on Garbage and get this amazing collection of blue songs performed by Eric Clapton from Musicians like Robert Johnson and others.
B00005JKCF|5.0|A day after this movie was released I was in line to buy a ticket.  I am usually not fond of superhero movies or comic books but this movie made me think twice about that opinion.  What a great movie!  The plot, even halfway through the movie, as still twisting and winding its way to a great ending climax while still supplying me with the required action that I need to keep me at the edge of my seat.  The acting was also not just tolerable but pretty professional.  So overall I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see an instant classic!!
B00005NKK8|5.0|This CD is definitely one of the best mixes and soundtracks of the sixties. This is a great CD so you can just let it play. It's a wonderful road trip CD.
B00006690F|5.0|Back by popular demand!...This controversy guy is back to show how the world really works.  His awesome quick response lyrics on any given topic is remarkable.  This album makes his other albums look bad.  Number one single is \\"Without Me\\"...the song shows the true sense of Eminem and that in reality he is not a bad person.  This Album is Number One...a must own!  I don't know what to say its just awesome!...GO OUT AND BUY IT!!

B00005JKCF|4.0|First of all - I like Sam Raimi very much. Hes a guy who knows directing since Evil Dead 1. He also knows - and we all can be lucky for that - how to deliver a great SpiderMan movie to the comic book fans and to those who are new to this charakter. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Willem dafoe are a marvelous and best fitting cast in the SpiderMan movie. The first time I saw the movie I was fascinated by the actors. Willem Dafoe seemed to have extended his experience from playing in \\"Shadow Of The Vampire\\" in a charismatic and physical way. Tobey Maguire will become the next big actor because he really can play and is the one actor for the role of Peter Parker. And same is with Kirsten Dunst. Loving her acting talent since \\"Interview with..\\" she really blew me away as M.J. Watson.<BR>Great special fx, storyline well adapted and improved, fast pacing and great Raimi cameos. Bruce Campbell as Ring Announcer, Ted Raimi as Reporter (theres also a great J.J. Jameson in the movie by the way) and Spidey-creator Stan Lee saves the day for a little girl under the attack of the Green Goblin. Only one thing robbed some of the illusion a couple (!!!) of times. I counted three appearences of the set microphone in the movie, others say four. WHY ??? There are Computers that can erase these mistakes. But go ahead, see SpiderMan and hope the sequel is in the works already. Feel fine with the end of the movie and wish for Sam Raimi to direct all of the sequels. And cut out those mics on the DVD ! Directors Cut please !
B00005NW02|3.0|I am (or at least was) a huge system of a down fan, but Toxicity is a defenite creative setback. The songs on this album are way too safe. Just look at the singles that have been released, chop suey!, toxicity and now aerials...all these track are the softest commercially sounding tracks on the album. The album shows little inovation and adding daron (the guitar player) as a backup vocalist on more songs was a bad idea concidering the guy cannot sing at all on this album. Gone are the mysterious sounding, innovative system of a down and they have been replaced a poor sounding parody of themselves.<BR>Pick this album up if you let Music channels and radio dictate what music you listen to. Sad....
0780622553|5.0|The movie DARK CITY not only has a good story, it also has style and is very artful. You may say that theres a weak plot but what plot isnt weak at the end ?<BR>Trust a movie fanatic with sense of taste and purchase this DVD. Even Roger Ebert has commented  the whole movie on the disc.
0451457994|4.0|This book is good. I know- bad start, but it's the truth. It's a darn good book. The way it's written- you can almost call it beautiful, just like the movie. It answers a few questions, so don't think you're gonna open this book, read it, and close it and go &quot;Oh Lord- I know the entire movie!&quot;. But- it does help (to me it did) to watch the movie, read the book once (or twice), and then watch the movie again. Usually I read the book, then watch the movie a few weeks after. And it helps, they interact in a way- that both answer questions. <BR>Okay, basically, if you don't know the book- I'll try my best to explain, there's most likely a review that's much better. But, in the beginning of time, back when the apes where on the planet, way way back then, this giant slab of mysterious rock came, and sorta evolved the apes into humans, it took millions of years, but that's what it did. Now, it's the year 2001, and a mysterious magnetic field is coming from the moon (granted, this book was written in the 1960s- so he thinks we'll be living on the moon in huge towns and be flying to the moon and Mars for a little weekend getaway and stuff like that, so, it's sorta dated- but not that bad), so they dig down, to find (surprise) the same &quot;rock&quot; that the ape monkeys found millions of years before. And then- in the middle of the book, you're thrown to the end of our solar system, where you are in a state of the art ship, and two guys and a computer (sounds like a bad sitcom), and about 4 other crew members sleeping make there way to Jupiter, and well, I know it doesn't make sense, but in the end it does make sense. And, I relly can't tell you the ending, because I really don't know the ending well enough to explain it. It's confusing, and it's mindbending...but it's good. I really suggest reading it. I really do, I'm on my 4th time reading it. And I always find something new.
0767840968|4.0|Another good, although very dark, edgy and bleak, Jeff bridges movie.<br />Bridges plays a poli-sci prof who is actually teaching a course in international terrorism, when he begins to discover evidence that his neighbor, whom he initially befriends and seems quite normal (played by Tim Robbins), isn't who he says he is, and might even be a terrorist himself.<br />Bridges becomes obsessed with finding out who Robbins really is, and the evidence Bridges uncovers seems to point to his being a terrorist who is planning an attack on a building somewhere in Washington DC. The evidence is very circumstantial, however, and at first we might be inclined to conclude Bridges is just too sensitive and paranoid about the subject. He discusses the evidence with his girlfriend and another friend who is an agent at the FBI, and they don't find Bridges' evidence as convincing, and in fact both of them think he's just being overly paranoid, and needs to get over it.<br />Bridges won't give up, however, and finally, in the last quarter of the movie, it becomes obvious that Robbins really is a bad guy and is definitely plotting something. Bridges sets out to stop him but in an ironic twist of fate, Robbins swaps cars with him and Bridges, unaware of the fact that Robbins has put the bomb in the trunk of Bridges' car, drives to the FBI building to warn everybody and thus becomes the unwitting accomplice in the tragedy. The bomb blows up, killing Bridges and hundreds of people in the building.<br />Another dark side to the movie is how Bridges gets blamed for the disaster in the press, where he is portrayed as an unstable, dangerous, obsessed wacko, rather than as a concerned teacher who was just trying to warn everybody.<br />Overall a good, although as I said, very dark, bleak, edgy and ultimately probably depressing film. The good guy dies, he fails to prevent the tragedy, and both his wife (who is killed in an earlier botched FBI raid) and his girlfriend are also dead. If there is a movie out there that epitomizes our current fears about urban terrorism, this is it.a movie out there that epitomizes our current fears about urban terrorism, this is it.
B00005K9LM|5.0|This is Priest doing what they do best during the time they were at their best at doing it. This is the most perfect heavy metal album ever made. I got this after it was first released &amp; have worn out several cassette &amp; vinyl versions. The songwriting &amp; performance are killer throughout. This reissue version sounds even better. The bonus track Turn On Your Light is a great Priest ballad, but sounds out of place in this context. The live version of Heavy Duty/DOTF is good as well, but doesn't surpass the original. This album is unappologetic metal in its' purest form. This is all leather &amp; studs!
0792841344|5.0|A great cult classic movie.  I saw this as a kid and it took me years to find it on VHS and later DVD.  The additional scenes are much to talk about, but just to have the movie in a DVD format is worth the price.
0738206679|5.0|The author was able to convey a difficult subject into laymen's terms. Every body must know what is in the book about the network, because, we are all members of it. It is a politically neutral book. The author does not express any of his own views when he examines social issues. It is rather a math book than a self-help book. The discussed topics are the latest development in the field of mathematics, but you do not have to be a Mathematician to read or understand it. You can even use the knowledge that you acquire from LINKED to understand the latest car ads too. When have finished reading you will feel that you could have been the author, because it is all inside of you or every one but you never were able to put it on paper.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Just flat out bad, bad bad.  I've been waiting for the next set of movies since 1983 and boy did this fall on its' face.  Growing up with the original three movies I always hoped that GL would finish up the story-but this outing failed horribly.  If you want it, wait for the dvd boxed set that will eventually be released after the EP III is released.  Bad....bad....bad.....
B00005NB8K|4.0|I might be the perfect audience for this movie.  I like the Doors music, but I haven't read any of the books about them.  I'm hot and cold on the excesses of Oliver Stone's film style, but it seemed to work in this case.  I don't know what is truth and what is fiction, but the style of the film blended into the music made for an entertaining experience.  In many ways the movie opened up their lesser-known songs to my enjoyment and the performances in the film are excellent.  Being somewhat tired of Meg Ryan's Romantic Comedy per year output, it was nice seeing what might happen to such a sweet girl in the throes of the 60s, Rock music and the decadent scene.  You also have to wonder why Val Kilmer wasn't nominated for an Oscar after his great performance.  What's interesting about hippie movies is that film makers inevitably identify with this period and have to contain themselves not to romanticize it, but I still come away glad that I wasn't a part of it.  <br />As for the Special Edition DVD, Oliver Stone provides insightful commentary about the making of the film and the meeting of Jim's and Pam's parents.  He points out and explains the symbolism of the Shaman and death and all of the things that seem in your face on first viewing.  I have always thought that Stone is a top-notch filmmaker mired in his own fascination with the 60s.  But you have to give the guy credit for movies like this.  No one anywhere could have made a big budget movie about The Doors except for Oliver Stone.
0446677450|3.0|This is an okay book. I had a hard time reading this one. Normally, I can read a book in a matter of hours, but it took me a week to get into this book. I kept putting it down, which is unusual for me. For those looking for good financial advice, I recommend buying, \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" It's a very short but very good life changing book. Buy this one if you like a challenge.
1587990717|2.0|The endless ego-centric platitudes in this book raise its overall noise-to-signal ratio to the point where the reader wastes too much time in getting its basic message:  that life and the financial markets are ruled by randomness and that our brains are not equipped to properly assess probabilistic situations and avoid making wrong decisions.  The book provides precious little practical advice on how to cope with financial randomness, other perhaps than reading The Economist instead of the daily financial press: essentially Odysseus' way of waxing his ears in order not to to fall prey to the sirens' songs     I would recommend Peter Bernstein's \\"Against the Gods\\" instead as a means to learn considerably more about the role of chance in the markets.
6305841861|5.0|This movie will always be a classic. Sure there are plot holes, a little bit of cheesy acting and special effects, and a whole lot of gore, but that's what makes this movie great. In order to truely appreciate Evil Dead 2, you have to take the movie for what it is, a cheesy, low-budget horror movie that isn't supposed to make sense or be thought-provoking. If anything, it's thought revoking, and that's a good thing.<br />The \\"hero\\" of the film, Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) isn't a burly super hero type. He's just an average guy put in a really screwed up situation. Less than ten minutes into the film, he kills his first zombie with a shovel. Most of the movie centers on him fighting the undead on his own. 3/4 of the film has Ash alone in the cabin either fighting a zombie or fighting himself (a very funny scene in the kitchen). Later on, some minor characters show up to progress the story and provide fresh corpses for the evil to infect, but that's where it gets interesting.<br />The commentary is excellent. Normally, I ignore the commentary on DVD's because most of it sounds like \\"Well, we shot this at nine in the morning and I still had a hangover from the night before, but at least I was getting paid 3 million per scene.\\" Evil Dead 2's commentary is far different. It sounds more like Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it ends up being just as good as the movie itself.<br />In short, if you want to see a dorky guy with a chainsaw decapitate zombies and blow them away with a shotgun, get this movie!
B000002JOH|4.0|For me, and probably for many others, \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" was a gateway album, one of the albums that got me into metal a couple years ago.  Pantera were able to combine a high level of accessibility with a full-on metal onslaught that brought together old-school thrash and Southern-style Sabbathesque sludge.  Dimebag Darrell may not be the best guitarist ever, but he does come up with some creative, memorable and catchy riffs; the riff from \\"Walk\\" has been periodically getting stuck in my head for about the past year.  The blazingly fast \\"...Hostile\\", featuring some extremely vitriolic vocals from Anselmo, is another highlight, along with the agressively anthemic \\"A New Level\\" and \\"Mouth for War.\\"  Lyrically, the album is stronger than many of its ilk, with diatribes directed at phonies, posers, and other lowlifes.  On the down side, the too-slow \\"No Good\\" is rather weak, and the ballad \\"Hollow\\" is pretty wretched.  Still, if you want to hear some metal with good, solid riffs, angry vocals and lyrics, and a strong songwriting (for the most part), VDOP is worth picking up.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jone's &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; has achieved such a high level of musical talent that I must recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates mellow tunes performed by masters. <br />Norah's music is a unique blend of folk and jazz with a slight echo of old school country blues. I haven't heard anything like this CD before. Norah's vocals flow like warm honey over each subtle melody and the imagery she uses to tell each story paints lasting pictures. With one release of a note, she can lift up the entire room and bring it softly back down again. I find myself wanting to hold onto each note and never letting go.<br />Picture walking along the wooden planks of any seaside town boardwalk, with someone you want to spend the rest of your life with and you can imagine this album. It is alive and visceral and will easily sweep you away into a blissful moment, if not afternoon.
B00005JL3A|5.0|This movie was the best movie I've seen since Final Fantasy: Spirits Within (also really good)!! ... But I had the chance to meet the director of Resident Evil and he didn't come up with the idea of making the movie, the creators of the games did. If people say this is a really bad movie then how come it got 3stars???? Sure it has bad CGI animation in it but nontheless it's really good, good story line, awesome make-up for the zombies. The movie is about a deadly virus called the T-VIRUS created by the Umbrella Corporation. Designed to combat ageing the virus has a side effect, reanimating dead cells. The virus was released into the HIVE the research lab deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City. A team of marines has 3 hours to contain the virus before it begins to infect the WHOLE HUMAN RACE. The movie consists of loads of CGI animation, zombies, the Licker, and the infamous crows from the games. I wonder what happends to Alice after leaves Raccoon City hospital???? By the way the movie was going to be called GROUND ZERO:RESIDENT EVIL but because of Sept.11 the title was changed to just plain RESIDENT EVIL. The sequel is due out in 2-3 years!!!!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Certainly the best picture of 2001. The cast is great and the story is one of the most originals Ive seen. But if Leonard cant remember anything later of the incident, why he knows his illness? That makes the story impossible. The DVD is very poor, specially in the spanish version.
B00005V1Z5|5.0|Zoolander is going to go down in history as a cult-classic. You'll either love or you'll hate. The comedy is foolish and stupid like Wayne's World, yet you can't help but fall on the floor laughing. Directed and starring Ben Stiller, an actor and director who is bound to bloom over the next 5 years, this movie has shown the diverse nature of Stiller. Ususually cast in awkward, tongue-twisted men who always set fire to the screen, Zoolander (a nim-witted, gorgeous fashion model) gets hyponitized to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Zoolander pokes fun at the fashion industry, models, and government conspiracy theories. Don't take the movie seriously, and don't expect mature comedy. This movie allows you to laugh at the simple things. Stiller's father, Jerry Stiller, plays the head of Balls Models, the man behind the conspiracies. Stiller's mother and sister are also cast in smaller roles. I suggest buying the DVD, the extra features are even funnier than the movie.
630503723X|3.0|In this sequel to Emmanuelle Silvia Kristel returns to the role she made her famous.<br />The sex scenes are good enough to forget the first one but the storyline is so dumb that makes me feel sick.<br />At least is much better than the sequels that go after.
B0000640SA|1.0|I love this movie,its one of the best.I am sick and tired of these greedy people pumping out limited editions of films that have already been given this status.When memento was released on dvd I purchased it right away.My point is wait until you get all the special features you can put on the dvd,THEN sell it.I love special features but ill be damned if im going to buy this thing twice.
0679735259|5.0|I have studied literature my entire life and I can honestly say that this IS one of the finest accounts of war (any war) ever written. I will not drop down a level by defending the book to those who simply don't like Herr's writing style. It does take a while to absorb the work and if you just can't get into it, perhaps you should go pick up some Stephen Ambrose.<BR>This is not Ambrose, however. This is more bordering on a blend of history and journalism (&quot;New Journalism&quot; for the schooled) and it is an amazing, hearwrenching account.<br />For those of you willing to give it a chance, there is a method to the madness, a reason he writes the way he does. It is unapolegtic and unrelenting. Those of you who read it all the way through are smart enough to figure it out.
B00005N915|5.0|Angel Heart never quite got the critical acclaim it deserved. Long before Mickey Rourke was reduced to doing Iglesias music videos, he actually had something of an acting career. In this, perhaps his best work, although not his best known, he plays an amnesiac private investigator sent on the trail of a 1940s crooner/singer named Johnny Favorite. While some of the plot twists are pretty evident to modern viewers (some later films have used similar twists to further their own plots), they were quite novel at the time of the film. The eerie film-noire atmosphere gives everything a sinister, seductive feel, and, while you can pretty much ascertain the identity of the PI's patron (Cypher), the identity of the elusive crooner remains a shocker at the end. Also, if you are a jazz fan, the eerie jazz of Trevor Jones provides a suitably melancholic atmosphere to the film. Lisa Bonet, the Cosby show's wild-child, performs admirably as a voodoo priestess who is also the daughter of Favorite, and the eventual lover of the PI. Rourke is great, as he was in those days, reflecting more emotional range than he was allowed in more notable films in which he participated, namely 9 1/2 Weeks and Wild Orchid. De Niro oozes diabolical smugness and a certain sinister quality that you just cannot quite put your finger on (yeah, if you READ the name of the guy, you know what he is...but those seeing the movie didn't have that luxury until the end credits ... MUCH better in this role than Pacino), and this is one of my favorite roles for him. The film works in a little bit of everything darkly occult, from benevolent, poor but soulful black-folks in voodoo cults, to rich and powerful white-folks with their secret devil worship to keep them rich and powerful. Set against the mysterious bayou backdrop of New Orleans, which only serves to enhance the spooky atmosphere, this film is a classic for anyone who is a fan of film noir.
1573222038|5.0|Sarah Waters takes her readers on an engrossing journey set in 19th century London.  A tale of love and betrayal written for the heart who has known both.  Romantic, dark, brutal and triumphant...a joy to read.
0790729385|5.0|The Exorcist set the standard for terror when it was released in 1973. While quickly superceded by movies focused on special effects and gore, this film still challenges one's conceptions of good truimphant over evil. The debate which raged after publication of Blatty's book gained even greater force following the movie: Does good triumph in the end, or did the Devil win? I, for one, am fully in the latter camp, and cannot fathom how one could conceivably think the former (Baal, after all, does reveal to the priest that he will leave when the priest has \\"joined us\\", and not before, and that the demon's mission is to kill Father Marrin, both objectives which he accomplishes elegantly in the end...where is good's vicory?). <br />Regardless of perspective, the movie still continues to provoke feelings of discomfort and terror, not the least since it is an \\"innocent\\" which is possessed in the first place. One initially starts off feeling empathy for Blair's character, then, when she begins tossing folks out of windows with their heads on backwards and entertaining herself with a crucifix, you emotionally abandon her mother to resolve the issue alone, the monstrosity of what is occurring too much to handle. <br />It is, perhaps, the emotional response to what one is witnessing, the villification of what is an innocent in all respects, and one's acceptance of that innocent and helpless child as evil incarnate to all but, perhaps, Marrin, who is ultimately destroyed by \\"her\\", that makes the film so horrifying. The helplessness and impotence of the faith of both priests to exorcise evil, in the end, makes one question the power of faith in the light (darkness) of evil. Truly one of the first films to ever bring the concept of complete despair to modern horror. A definite must see...
B000007T1M|4.0|The music that your parents hate, the music that has so much political substance and messages - just like their new one, but almost more so here. So, I picked up this album after &quot;Toxicity&quot; so I am kind of new to the band. Just listen to &quot;War&quot; Serj's explosive delivery to his lyrics really carry a lot of these tunes. No other band can do a songs like these. Other noteworthy songs &quot;Sugar&quot;, and &quot;Spiders&quot; which features Serj without the explosive ranting, where you can see just how talented this band actually is. They do what they want, and they don't let steriotypes of what music should sound like bother them. A sign of a great band.

There always seem to be an ora of strange darkness surrounding them and it broods over to there powerful griping music. The song \\"mutter\\" is like a mind numbing death metal opera. The lyric are all in german but they seem to boost the song, give it and even more intriging texture. rammstien is an awsome experince one that can be heard with your ears but be felt by your heart.

0684830515|5.0|About the fifth time I read this book, I realized there was sometime special about the title.  Let me explain the title. And in the explanation, I will give you the key to understanding this book.<br />The title is from Ecclesiastes, the words of the Preacher, in the King James version of the Old Testament.<br />&quot;One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth forever.<br />&quot;The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.&quot;<br />Jake cannot fulfill his destiny of fathering the next generation. The war took that away from him.  His destiny is personified in the woman of his dreams. Four simple words speak loudly of his desire: &quot;And there was Brett.&quot;<br />He sends her away with her different lovers and then meets her when she comes back to him. She goes away. She comes back. They cannot stay away from each other. That is the whole story.<br />Jakes buries himself in work. He works hard. Much of the book is about his work. And about his meals. Hemingway likes to write about food and drink. He describes all the food they eat. You can taste it. And about sleep. The people are always going to sleep.<br />What marvelous focus.<br />The Preacher said:<br />&quot;There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour, This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.&quot;<br />Jake does exactly that. But he cannot reproduce. He can never father children. He can never live with a woman.<br />The Preacher said:<br />&quot;Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the day's of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.&quot;<br />The key to understanding what this book is all about is in the Book Of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament.<br />Hemingway's novel is a very religious work of art. Too few critics and scholars note that. They are foused on other themes.<br />To really understand The Sun Also Rises, read the words of the Preacher before you read the book and after you read the book.<br />To those of you who have never read Ecclesiastes, prepare yourself for a major shock of recognition. You will know what I mean when you came across thos very familiar words you will recognize at once.<br />Those words make this novel more profound that you can ever imagine.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I just bought this CD, after seeing John Mayer on television.  This album is amazing -- an incredible combination of pop, R&B and just great guitar work.  The lyrics are sweet, but not precious.  Contrary to some of the insipid reviews this album has gotten on Amazon, there is nothing bland here.  On the contrary, this is beautiful, soulful music.  Enjoy.
B00005Y228|5.0|What a comeback for Kylie!!  I am very impressed by this album!!  The songs have a kind of Ero-Pop sound, combined with American Pop--which I really like!  I mean talk about wantin' to &quot;Bust a Move!&quot;  My favorite songs from this album are Fever, Can't Get You Out of My Head, Fever, &amp; Give It to Me.  I seriously think that Kylie will be topping the charts with a good number of her songs for quite some time!  <BR>Not to mention that her photo on the cover of the album looks like Amy Reynolds!<br />*Truly Outrageous!
0671027379|5.0|I must get Dan Brown's other two books because this one had great characters, an unusual plot, enough death-defying twists and turns to satisfy the most avid adventure reader, AND an ending that completely fooled me.

044651652X|4.0|What is it in a story that takes it to the New York Times Best Seller List for three years or 156 weeks?  When I read this book, that was what I wanted to know.  I look at the book on the shelf and think, &quot;What was there that I just did not get?&quot;<br />The love story set in the 1960s is about Robert Kincaid, a renowned photographer, and a Francesca Johnson, a farm wife.  The story is based on her diaries and the personal effects he had sent to her after he died.<br />She is secluded and alone much of the time.  When Robert comes to photograph the bridges, her family is away at the state fair.  They are, like Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers who will only remain in each other's hearts and minds for all of their life, though they only shared four days.  Her diaries indicate that for about thirty years Francesca maintained the emotional contact she committed to Kincaid by seeing his photography in National Geography, news clippings, and reading the articles written about him.<br />It is easy to be in love for four days.  Anyone can.  New love is exciting, romance is thrilling, and a new lover's touch is magical.  Yes, it will last forever -- if you do not have to wake up to reality.  It was simple to see this aspect of the enchantment about their story.  Francesca wrote of the agony that she felt when choosing whether to go with Kincaid or stay with her family, her children.  This was the crux of her story; stay with her husband and children, or run off with a stranger.<br />I could never understand that, my child is first.  Today the book is on my daughter's shelf, and she knows more about the emotions that drove Kincaid and Francesca than I ever will.  I am too practical; but she tells me I have never loved as they did -- and she just might be right because I still wonder why this book sold millions.  Suspend disbelief and enjoy the romantic interlude.<br />Perhaps I should have seen the movie (I am a Clint Eastwood fan). For me the book was worth three stars, but the millions of people who loved this book and movie cannot all be wrong, so it must be a five.  I guess I will give it a four.<br />Victoria Tarranithree stars, but the millions of people who loved this book and movie cannot all be wrong, so it must be a five.

0385503954|2.0|I'm not sorrry I plowed through this book, but I sure wouldn't give it a great review. &quot;Atonement&quot; is so crammed with (yes, beautiful) details that I found it claustrophobic and too dense. I wasn't crazy about the way McEwen leapt through time either, didn't register with me as true, not even true, certainly far from the best fiction. I don't recommend buying this. If you must see what all the fuss is about, go to a library. <br />What the fuss is about is his natural talent, obvious hard work and character development. I know that sounds like more than enough but for me it was decidedly less than enough. 2 stars only

B00006690G|4.0|This album contains the usual celebrity bashing, battle rapping, anger filled style songs... but it also contains a different side of Eminem.  There are emotional songs, music / political songs, and Em even experiments by using different production methods for songs (more instrument filled tracks)... <br />This could be an Eminem album either loved or hated by Eminem's long-time fans... some fans may be turned off by these songs because they sound less hiphop orientated, but for fans who are not afraid to hear something different this could be the perfect album for you...  On an MTV2 interview Eminem stated that guitars are not used alot in hiphop and on this album he takes advantage of the instrument, and a good number of the tracks on this contain some guitar playing....  AND HE DID A GOOD JOB!!!  It helped give the instruments more life and made them more tolerable to listen to as Em flowed over them...<br />Lyrically Eminem's flow has improved VERY WELL and he still contains that emotion behind the words, but it seems his vocab has gotten simpler... but then again as long as he proves his point, big words don't' matter....<br />Eminem addresses musical / political issues on \\"White America\\" where he talks about how racism in music benefited him.  He talks about his downfall relationship with his mother on \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\".  On \\"Sing For The Moment\\" Eminem talks about how musical influence on children may be nightmares for parents because they refuse to accept it.  \\"Superman\\" is how Eminem brags he is the super-man that's SINGLE and brags about his lovelife.  \\"Hailie's Song\\" is an ode to his daughter where he actually SINGS, which may have mixed reviews for some fans, but I enjoyed it...<br />Along with his 'serious' songs Eminem also has the playful / battle tracks.  \\"Without Me\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Drips\\", \\"When The Music Stops\\", and a VERY VERY HOT TRACK \\"Say What You Say\\" where Dre and Em talk about how they handle their opponents...<br />But some songsdo fail to capture me such as \\"Soldier\\", \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", and even \\"'Till I Collapse\\" (the drumline is IRRITATING in it and hurt the track alot)... <br />Overall it's definitely a good album by Eminem... It may satisfy some, but it may turn off others... It matters how open people are to different material...  There's still plenty shiners on here.... Only reason it doesn't get a 5-star rating is because it seems that in areas it could've been better, but its above average all over....<br />If u like Eminem, check out Chino XL...  Chino, the King of Punchlines, was hiphop's first celebrity basher and he may have influenced Eminem to diss everyone too...  give Chino his well deserved props and pick up \\"I Told You So\\" and \\"Here To Save You All\\"...<br />I'm Out... Mind Power!!!
B000002KKK|5.0|Of all of ZZ Top's albums, this one is the best example of their talent, with excellent production, creative and inspired musicianship and song choice. On Deguello, ZZ Top finds an excellent balance between their R&B/blues musicality, creativity, sense of humor and rock and roll drive. Dust my Broom is ZZ's excellent version of an Elmore James standard, with fantastic slide guitar by Billy G. A euphamistic blues lyrical style that has roots as far back as Robert Johnson is evident on songs like Hi Fi Mama and A Fool For Your Stockings. Gibbons, Hill and Beard acted as their own (barely) passable horn section on this album, though obviously it was done for the fun of it. I Thank You is ZZ's take on a classic R&B hit, to which they add their own style of lyrical innuendo. Manic Mechanic is early evidence of the wierd black humor that would show itself again on Heaven, Hell, or Houston from El Loco and rear its head completely on later releases like Rhythmeen. Throughout, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard play rock solid rhythm, to which Billy Gibbons adds some of his best guitar work, with slinky slide, lowdown and oh-so-smooth rhythm and lead guitar, and lots of tonal variation.
0385503954|4.0|Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" succeeds on many levels but, in the end, comes up short as a wholly satisfying tale.  Whether primarily seen as an unfolding mystery, a sweeping family saga, a novel of manners, or a psychological study - each focus is fuzzed by the piecemeal intrusion of the others.  As a result, the full 351 pages never really become more than the sum of its distinct parts.  This overall reaction is probably due to great expectations not being met because there are many good things here to appreciate and savor.  While I would certainly recommend that friends take it out of the library, I do not think it needs to be added to one's personal collection, a cumulative hobby I've long advocated.<br />Told in three parts (with a necessary epilogue,) the tale revolves around 13-year-old Briony's breathlessly melodramatic lie about the \\"rape\\" of a cousin.  The longish first part takes us through a single day in 1935 which culminates in the faux crime.  The plot result is the imprisonment of her sister Cecelia's beau Robbie.  Part Two then fast-forwards five years hence to the British humiliation at Dunkirk which we see through the disjointed perspective of Robbie's battle fatigue.  Part Three shows us Briony's passage to nursing school in London and her eventually seeking atonement for her pernicious fabrication years before.  The epilogue is barely satisfactory in answering further questions that have been raised in passing.<br />As I say, maybe borrow a copy sometime but don't plan on this being a \\"must read\\" for this season at the beach.
6300273016|4.0|Biographers Danny Sugerman and Jerry Hopkins (No One Here Gets Out Alive) along with the Doors remaining members provide snippets regarding their dark, possessed, mystical lyricist, Jim Morrison. Excerpts from songs feature two in its entirety, \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"Touch Me\\".<br /><br />Members reveal how difficult he was to live with: traveling to airports, tours, etc. He was always living on the edge, possessed with a vision of madness and fire and the road to self-destruction. Morrison was an intellectual poet but they didn't know who would come out, the erudite scholar or Kamakazee; or would it be Jekyll or Hyde.<br /><br />If you don't quite know what this sexually charismatic wildman is like, you will get the picture here. It would have been great to include more of the entire performances....Rizzo
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have to admit that I am usually unimpressed with a film that is made from a book. In this case.....I was PLEASANTLY surprised. To make a long story short....... I read the books because some children that I tutor were huge Harry Potter fans. I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I bought and read them also. They were great! I couldn't imagine how a filmmaker could bring this to the screen and still stay true to the book. I was very happy to see that Chris Columbus did just that! Of course there are very small subtle differences that really aren't important for the story and also save time to concentrate on the BIGGER story. The special effects, story line and characters make for a great movie. I have now watched my dvd at least 7 times and enjoyed it each time!(The dvd came out earlier in Europe) I now cannot wait until November for the Chamber of Secrets film. I recommend this film to anyone who loved the book, or anyone wanting 2 1/2 hours of pure fun!
B00003CXI1|4.0|Dark, lengthy and full of whispers, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" makes for a curious kids film. But wannabe wizards and other fans of the century's first boxoffice phenomenon will find the DVD transfigures theatrical drawbacks into delights. While some multiplexes were incapable of delivering \\"Potter's\\" visual subtleties, the wand wavers at Warner conjure up a two-disc DVD set in which magical images replace most of the murk. Flesh tones that threatened to wash out hold their detail nicely, even by candlelight. Down-in-the-dungeon scenes exhibit an artful but still clammy blend of pale blues and blacks. The outdoors quiddich match scores with a handsome 3-D illusion. Royal reds, golds and Augusta greens saturate the screen throughout. Whites still seem unnatural at times. The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX audio (in English and Spanish) brings out the many muted lines of dialogue, allowing listeners to catch all of Headmaster Dumbledore's admonitions. (There is no DTS option.) The children's voices are clear; John Williams' signature score enjoys a sweeping soundstage. Rear effects seem like they could do a lot more - especially in the frenzied quiddich game. But there are snitches of inspired surround in the air. The games are OK, some are frustratingly simple but addictive.
B00003CXI1|5.0|After writing my review, I went back and read reviews from other ''critics''. A few of them said that the film was boring because it was too true to the book! What is that for an excuse? When a film is made from a book, it should be exactly like the book! Why make it(the film) if you are going to use another title and story? I always look forward to seeing the adaptation of the book brought to life. I have a great imagination and always want to see how others imagine it also. I think Chris Columbus did a fantastic job on the film. He also made the right decision to stay true to the books. I don't want to see The Chamber of Secrets if the characters are different, if the protaganists are different or if the story lines are different. If I want a new story and characters from Harry Potter..... I will wait for the next story from Miss Rowling. I really feel if you are a fan of the books, you will miss out if you don't have this film in your collection.........
B00005NWM3|5.0|I just borrowed this CD from a friend of mine. I had hared the singles that nickelback has released from the album how you remind me an too bad. I thought that the album would be along the lines of those songs which are good of course. HOwever, upon listening ot the entire album, you get to see a lot of other songs that are a little heavier or give an aded perspective to nickelback like the song never again which is something I initially wouldn't have thought that nickelback would have written considering how heavy it is and with the fact that it tackles the issue of domestic violence. The album features other heavy songs like woke up this morning and where do I hide. They are also some softer songs that are good like hangnail. Good times gone is another good song on the album. <br />Overall, I'd say that Silver Side up is strong album that helps you to appreciate the band better.
B00006690F|5.0|...That's all i gotta say (in a good way). Eminem is back and better than ever. He is crazy on this album. He lyricly kills everyone who has givin' him ish his whole life and these last past 2 years. I mean he goes from Kim to Elton John to his mom to even Chandra Levy who is dead. C'mon you gotta have a lot of balls to do that! Eminem attempts to sing on the song titled \\"Hailie's Song\\" and I think his attempt is sucessful. His CD is off the hook. gotta give him nothin' but love for his music and for all the stuff he's been through. I actually got this full cd from the internet and i love it. BUT i also bought the Special Limited Edition with the DVD (that you can't download) before i had the CD, but i'm still gonna stay with the order 'cause this album is the hottest i heard and i want Eminem to make money. Plus i think there is gonna be a bonus track on the cd named \\"Stimulant\\" (but i'm not guaranteeing it). So i mean c'mon buy the album so Eminem makes a lot of money so he can make a new cd really soon and not make us fans wait 2 years (but it's well worth the wait). Don't mess with the bootleggers. PS. Check Out Royce Da 5'9\\"'s new CD comin' in Sept. []Deace! 1! I'm Out!!
B0000508U6|5.0|This is truly a brilliant pop/rock record. The guitar melodies are intelligently written and delivered with skill. The vocals are intriguing and compelling. The lyrics are not overly heavy but not completely meaningless-just right for a pop record. The hooks are great, too; you'll find yourself singing along sooner than you want to. Over a year after its release, this CD still regularly finds its way into my car's CD player, rebirthing itself every few months or so. &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a rare achievement, an inescapable recording that seems it will never get old.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love this album, Shakira can really connect with an audience through her music.  My favorite track is Fool.  Shakira has  range of emotions, party songs roamantic songs and great dance songs.  Every song on this album deserves 5 stars.

B0000069NM|5.0|My first introduction to Scofield was his most recent album &quot;Uberjam&quot;.  After grooving to that album for a few weeks, I decided this was a guy I needed to better represent in my Jazz collection.  So, I did a bit o' research.  <BR> Now I've loved Medeski Martin and Wood for a long time - they are by far the best Acid Jazz/Funk/Groove trio I've ever listened too, and I own a number of their albums, and they seldom leave my CD player.  So when I discovered they were running backup to Scofield's funky guitar licks and rips, on John's album &quot;A Go Go&quot;, I was immediately interested.<BR>  Now I'm not one to get too picky, but the album should be titled, &quot;John Scofield and MMW - A Go Go&quot;, because it can't be denied that these two separate musical entities are perfectly complementing each other.  I never would have believed that adding a guitar, even one of equal trip-potential, would have so benefited the stylings of MMW.  And to his credit, Scofield does a marvellous job of leading the sound.  This is a perfect harmony of styles and improvisations - the sound that this foursome jams out is incredible.  If you are a fan of the acid jazz/funk style, or of Scofield, or of MMW - then buy this CD.  It's the best grouping of talent, and the best result of said grouping, that I've ever heard.  This is a seamless fusion of a rare and perfectly matched musical union.
B000003489|4.0|This is one of Coltrane's classic albums - Giant Steps is up there with \\"A Love Supreme\\", \\"Blue Train\\", and \\"Favorite Things\\". The songs are short and catchy. This version of the album has several alternate takes, and it serves to double the length. Excellent disc
B00003CXZ4|5.0|First, a word of warning, if you decide to buy this film, make sure that you're in the right frame of mind to sit down and watch it. Clear a two hour space in your schedule to watch it, and then add an extra hour or so while you flick back through the film and attempt to come to terms with what you've just witnessed. It really does help to have the brain cells firing on all cylinders for this film!<br />Memento is one of the most original and intelligent (not to mention funny and profound) films of the last decade. Possibly ever.<br />The story revolves around the character of Leonard Shelby, (played wonderfully by Guy Pearce), a man who has no short-term memory. Since an attack in which his wife was brutally raped and murdered (Leonard's last memory is of this in fact), and in which he recieved a damaging blow to the back of his head, he has been totally unable to make new memories. Something of a problem when Leonard is utterly consumed by the desire for revenge.<br />In order to place the viewer in a similar state to the protagonist, the film has a unique structure, beginning at the end of the movie chronologically, and working its way backwards through time in small (10 - 20 min) segments. Viewing the film, you find yourself in the same position as Leonard, desperately seeking the truth about what has happened to him, and willing him on in his strange investigation.<br />There is also a wonderful kind of twist at the (actual) end of the film, which completely changes your views on what has transpired and no matter how good you are at guessing the ending of films, this one is going to catch you out. How Christopher Nolan managed to cultivate such an intriguing and intricate story as this is astonishing.<br />The performances of the three main leads are superb. Guy Pearce plays Shelby with the perfect amount of bewilderment, ironic humour, and pathos. It is essential to the way the story works that we feel empathy for his character and his situation, and Pearce manages this brilliantly.<br />Carrie-Ann Moss puts in a great performance as Natalie, one of the two main characters whom Leonard comes into contact with. She manages to remain ambivalent all the way through the film, and one is never sure whether to trust her or not.<br />Joe Pantoliano puts in a scene-stealing performance as 'Teddy', the friend that Shelby can never quite trust. Pantoliano's performance, (like The Matrix co-star Carrie-Ann Moss'), is ambivalent throughout, but he manages to remain wonderfully charismatic. He keeps us guessing about what it is that he knows about Leonard and his past all the way through the movie.<br />The movie in itself would be worth the purchase of the DVD, but the inclusion of an original story by Jonathan Nolan (the directors brother), an interview with Christopher Nolan, the entire shooting script (complete with notes and scrawls written over by various parties involved in the film), as well as a hidden feature by which you can watch the film re-edited in chronological order, it really is an essential purchase.<br />I can't recommend this film highly enough, particularly to those who enjoy thrillers, or giving their brain a good work out during a film.<br />How this film missed out in the Oscars is beyond me. Brilliant stuff.
0385503954|3.0|This is a very well-written, indeed it's a beautifully written, book. The language used just keeps you flowing along through the<BR>                     story, which is absorbing in its own right. The book presents a tale of misplaced knowledge, of conclusions reached without sufficient<BR>                     information, and of accusations made which profoundly change the lives of everyone involved. We see guilt, sorrow, venality, heroism,<BR>                     in fact, almost every emotion runs through this book except the one most needed: forgiveness. The author is to be commended for the<BR>                     way in which he presents the events unfolding around the main characters, and the sterling use which he makes of our language, turning<BR>                     the commonplace into something almost profound. You will not be disappointed if you read this work. I predict a literary prize in its<BR>                     future.
B00006690G|5.0|The Album is very very good, and very different than the two that precede it. Its alot darker and down to earth. But the lyrics are world class, and the beats...the best song I reckon on the album is \\"Till I Collapse\\" its like the \\"Criminal\\" of this album....Well I cant say anymore..just buy the album, if you dont like it...I think you should seriously re-consider your tastes in music. Amazing!
B00000G3AZ|3.0|What a shame that the DVD format is so abused by this release.  I played my old VHS version after I viewed the DVD version and the color blance and saturation was far superior on the VHS version.  The DVD version's images are wanting in sharpness and detail, exhibiting a soft focus throughout; however, the trailers found within the special features on the DVD displayed the sharp focus and rich colors you would expect from a quality DVD. This DVD version should be found in the $[money] budget video shelf.
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaimon has interested me since I first bumped into him as co-author (with Terry Pratchett) of Good Omens.  I awaited this novel with a great deal of anticipation.<br />It was nothing at all that I expected and a great deal more.  Rich with cultural references, mythology, symbol, and signifiers, the novel doesn't just hold your attention.  It grabs you by the frontal lobes and shouts PAY ATTENTION!  Do. If you blink you'll miss something vital.<br />His prose is like a blending of Sherman Alexie and Terry Pratchett with a dash of Douglas Adams, but make no mistakes: Gaimon is anything but an imitator.  What many authors waste 200 pages on he snaps into being with a turn of phrase or a seemingly casual reference.<br />I loved the landmine references to various mythologies.  The characters are rich, well developed, and different.  His understanding of America and Americans was a delightful surprise.  READ IT!
B000002BUY|5.0|Incubus first came into my life through the radio, hearing \\"Drive\\" from their Make Yourself CD. Soon after that, I bought it. Naturally, I loved it, so I had to get the others. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. gave me quite an unexpected shock! The whole CD is one energy burst after another, almost like a drug. And the diversity between each track is extraordinary - only a band like Incubus can pull something like this off and make it sound good. A true mind trip from start to finish, this CD is a must for everyone... who can handle the energy. Here are my opinions on each song:<br />1. Redefine (4.5/10) - A perfect opener for the CD! Wild and experimental from the beginning, the trippy lyrics and beat will have you rocking out of your chair.<br />2. Vitamin (4.5/10) - A great unique song, like a bomb ready to explode. The quieter beginning is a trap for the hard beats and lyrics to follow - and indeed, the trap works like a charm.  <br />3. New Skin (5/5) - My personal favorite track on the CD. Brandon's drumming is fantastic, and his smart way of disguising society as a scab in his lyrics makes the song perfect. Rock on! <br />4. Idiot Box (4/5) - The first song I loved on this CD! Clever lyrics, clever beats, clever meanings - an Incubus classic.<br />5. Glass (4/5) - One of their odder songs on the CD, \\"Glass\\" is a great addition that turns up the electricity. With its catchy lyrics and beats, this song nearly reaches a 4.5, but not quite. <br />6. Magic Medicine (2.5) - A bunch of DJ mixing - not too bad, but it never really caught my attention. The beginning is funny, though: \\"On this page, we see a little girl giggling at a hippopotamus... I wonder why?\\"<br />7. A Certain Shade of Green (5/5) - A definite Incubus classic! This one ties with \\"New Skin\\" on my favorite list. You'll find yourself unconsciously humming the chorus, or even singing out the catchy lyrics. A smart, clever, and entertaining song.<br />8. Favorite Things (4/5) - This one really lives up to the rest of the tracks, with its hard guitar and awesome lyrics. Not exactly the best on the CD, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. still would never be complete without it!<br />9. Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song) (4/5) - Really cool beginning. The rest of the song is pretty cool too, but a little repetitive. Brandon sings it really well though - relaxing, mmm. The perfect sing-along song.<br />10. Nebula (4.5/5) - Why do I love this song so much? Definitely the weirdest on the CD, next to \\"Calgone\\". Unique rhythms and lyrics, and a quite catchy chorus. Can't stop listening... can't stop listening... can't stop...<br />11. Deep Inside (?/5) - Haven't heard it all the way through. Sorry, can't rate it.<br />12. Calgone (4.5/5) - Wheeee! Like \\"Vitamin,\\" it has a beginning that traps you for the wild, intense, and somewhat rebellious lyrics and chorus. It goes from slow, to wild, to slower, and back to wild. Also, like \\"Nebula,\\" it's very addicting - for me, at least.<br />Hope that gives you a taste of S.C.I.E.N.C.E.! I recommend it to all Incubus fans, or to anyone who wants to try something new. Have fun rockin' out in your living room! Cheers.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Shortly after Sara meets Jonathan, she tells him that serendipity, one of her favorite words, means &quot;a fortunate accident.&quot; That two people who feel themselves &quot;click&quot; in a special way together can walk away from one another without having more to hold onto of the other's identity than a glove, is definitely an UNfortunate accident. Sara believes in letting fate decide what will happen between the two. And while the &quot;signs&quot; and &quot;clues&quot; that fate throws their way when they spend all those years apart are fairly believable and quite enjoyable to watch, what happens is predictible. Even so, it doesn't stop you from impatiently awaiting the grand finale when not fate, but love - will prevail.
B00002DEMV|5.0|Speed metal meets Opera....amazing...Tarja's voice is beautiful...this entire album is gorgeous...and this is not [WEEK] music either...it's quite heavy! \\"Devil & the Deep Dark Ocean\\" is what got me hooked to these Finlandish masters of Gothic powermetal. Beautiful and unforgetful! Any music fan will love it!
0446677450|3.0|I read the book and left with the impression that I had read one chapter, over and over again. The principles Kiyosaki advocates are mostly good (one exception, I'll describe below), but he offers little or no real substance--no how-to, no details. He also tends to brag about his conquests a bit too much; makes me want to hear equal time for his failures (never mentioned).<BR>The principle that I disagree with is to place properties into a corporation and then take your money out as &quot;expenses&quot;. The problem is that the IRS is fully aware of this &quot;trick&quot; and nobody in his right mind would do such a thing and invoke the wrath of the &quot;Revenooers&quot;. I also read &quot;Income for Life from Real Estate&quot; at about the same time and found it to be much more useful, not just a sales pitch for the author and his products. I would be interested in knowing what other readers who have read both books have to say.
B00005RFVL|5.0|this album is great! i haven't stopped listening to it since i bought it. robbie just proved again he can excell at whatever he takes on. i hope he does another album like this one. so my only question is when will we see robbie as a leading man on the big screen?
B00006690F|2.0|This album has 1, maybe 2 good songs and that's it.  \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Till I Collapse,\\" and that is only because Nate Dogg does the chorus.  I like Marshall Mathers better that this one.  Eminem is beginning to be like all other rappers....start out hot and fade off, with the only reason people buying their CDs is the hope that it'll be like the 1st album, Snoop Dogg being the main example.  I recommend listening to it before buying it, and the DVD wouldn't make me buy this any more than just the CD.
B00005QDW1|3.0|...Rock Steady isn't No Doubt's best CD, but it really annoys me how people think they are now just another mainstrem pop/hip hop band. The truth is that they really are still and always will be a ROCK band, OKAY!!! I even slightly \\"lost faith\\" in them after Rock Steady was released, but that was until I saw them in concert. They were awesome. It wasn't like any cheesey dance routines like you may think now, but they really rocked out. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't judge No Doubt from this one CD, but look into their older stuff like The Beacon Street Collection and their first CD and go to a No Doubt concert. Believe me, they aren't mainstream \\"sellouts\\", they are a real, talented ROCK band.
B00006690F|5.0|It looks as if he's got a hit.  I ran to 2 stores this morning to get the CD.  When I popped it in my car, every song bumped in my system to my enjoyment.  This CD blows everything of his material away with the exception of the Slim Shady EP, the underground CD before his LP.  Song's like White America, Cleaning out My Closet, and Soldier send you on a crazy ride.  He's back.  And he's back with a vengeance.  Cop this CD!! You can catch him singing on Hailiey's Song for the first few bars and here him bash Ms. Cheney!! <--- One of my fav's.  But all and all, he deliever's with everything you've wanted to hear with a more \\"Rock\\" beat tone than a \\"Hip Hop\\" one.  But still the best of this year.
B00005V6OD|4.0|I have been a fan of John Williams' music since the first Star Wars film. For that movie, Williams composed a theme for each character in the same way that Prokofiev did with his musical story, Peter and the Wolf.<br />This has been done again for the Harry Potter film, with a theme for Harry, a theme for his owl, Hedwig, a Hogwarts school song, a Nimbus 2000 theme, a theme for the Quidditch match and a very dodgy corny theme for Voldemort, which goes Vol - de -mort, Vol- de- mort: not Williams' most inspiring creations.<br />Williams has created unusual harmonies and melodies to reflect the mystical subject matter very effectively. For instance, there is something [intentionally] weird about the Hogwarts School Song, and the Christmas Music is a little like the music you hear during the festive season, but also slightly odd. These quirks are what makes the music in the film special. I don't think you will find many people whistling the tunes, though!<br />The bonus CD has trailers in English, French, German, Italian, Korean and Thai. It is great fun to watch the same trailer in all the different languages.<br />You will find the audio CD a bit repetitive, because the Hedwig theme is repeated over and over, without much variation. But the music is enjoyable, nonetheless.
B000066744|5.0|This movie is one of the biggest suprises, turned it on not expecting much as I had never heard of it. It is wonderful from start to end, full of emotion and wonderful acting. The story keeps you interested all the way through. This will go down as one of my all time favourite movies.
B000001GXL|5.0|This is a wonderful CD, at an excellent price. The interpretation of the First Piano Concerto does allow Beethoven to be Beethoven, as another reviewer has remarked. Some performances of this concerto sound dismissive, but this one is evocative and sensitive.<br />I love the Third, Fourth and Fifth Concertos. The Third was my introduction to Beethoven Piano Concertos through listening and following the score in Year Ten Music classes. It is a remarkable work, with some similarities to the Fifth Symphony in the way Beethoven exhaustively develops the opening theme of the first movement.<br />Highly recommended recording.
B000065U1N|1.0|This Movie is terrible...I paid good money to see it in the theater..and I'm telling you people who read this dont waste your money buying this crap...it not even worth your time. It shows how bad the US Army screws up and it shows how our tax money is spent on stupid fighting in a country we have no business being in. Please dont waste your money on this.

1573226521|5.0|How do you rate a good book? By the number of big words used? The promises of saving the world or change your life?  <br />The Beach is neither.  Yet it achieve every spec of a good book in a down-to-earth and pleasant way.  The pleasantness comes through the way in which Garland portrays his characters and story.  He kept things light.  He didn't use big words.  He didn't describe 10 pages on a vase.  The story sailed along.  Every now and then, Garland inserts nuances of philosphy (expressed through the plain language of that of a regular young person). While you may just be absorbed in the fantasy-like story that Garland in painting, out of nowhere a web of conflicting thoughts confront you.  Suddenly you realize that the story is not about a paradise beach, but about the human conditions.  It is about the evolution of evil.  It is about where evil stems from (good).  It is about how something so naive and fun can suddenly be betrayed into paradise-lost.  <br />Without giving away the essense of the story, my suggestion for those who might be reading the book for the first time is to closely monitor the progression of the story in reference to the rise of Nazism, or rather any extremisms.  Garland ingeniusly presented the process in which human desires manifest, going overboard and becoming evil.  The most incredible part is that he seemed to have done it so effortlessly, so \\"unintellectually\\" ... ultimately most effectively.<br />The Beach falls into the same category of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, or George Orwell's 1984 (see my reviews on those books as well).  Yet what distinguishes The Beach is the way in which Garland presented his ideas. And he is anything but conventional. <br />The book is worthy of reading over and over both for its intellectual and entertainment value.  Just as a footnote, please do not in any way think the Hollywood movie version portrayed the essence of Garland's thoughts at all.  The movie had good visuals, but for the thoughts, read the book.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.
B000063S6Z|4.0|\\"18\\" picks up where the multi platinum \\"Play\\" left off and goes to the next level successfully. The album contains mostly new age, modern gospel, and alternative pop tunes. This is Moby's mellowest effort to date. Fans of the new age sound will love this one. \\"Sleep Alone\\" features a softer Moby vocal and could easily place him on the adult contemporary charts alongside the likes of Enya. \\"Jam For The Ladies\\" is the albums only hip hop entry with guest vocalists MC Lyte and the superhot Angie Stone. As with past Moby albums this one features an array of guest vocalists; Azure Ray is certain to please Enya afficianados.<BR>The album's muscle comes from the three modern gospel tracks, two featuring the Shining Light Gospel Choir, and \\"The Rafters\\" with vocalists Shauna & Lorraine Phillips.<BR>Though the true highlights are alt-pop tracks \\"Extreme Ways\\" and \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\" both feature Moby's lead vocals and each could easily follow his recent hit \\"South Side\\" to the top of the charts. The only complaint I have about this album is that there aren't more songs like these two featuring Moby's vocals. I would really like to here an entire album of alt-pop tunes sung by Moby.
0440219078|1.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is a very opinionated book. Different people will think different things about the book and I think there are too many choices to make at the end of the story. In The Giver, a child named Jonas is getting his new 'assignment' for his life and he just happens to get the 'Receiver of Memory'. He then must receive memories of things that other people in the community do not know.<br />In the Giver, Lowry tried to make some sort of Utopia (Perfect World) and wanted to show that this would probably never happen and that this world might be perfect but there are still some flaws in it. The author also tries to show that our world also has flaws. I think the author tried to go too far into the future because it might be a long time until we invent or do things [are bad] as: people come and take your dishes at night, when you get hurt or have pain, they bring a pill to you and the pain just goes away.<br />I believe this book should not be intended for children or young adults, I think it should be for people 14 years and up. This book should not have been made for everyone because it shows a kid that committing suicide will get you out of a problem or a bad situation. This book haunts me in my sleep and I am 12, I'm not scared of hardly anything but this book scared me. Just think about it, would you want your child to be reading a book where a 12 year old washes and cleans and elderly person? Would you want your child to be reading a book where somebody injects a baby in the head with some sort of liquid? Would you want your child to be reading a book where a boy dreams of bathing a girl in his sleep? If I could, I would ban this book in any library or store. Because of these reasons, I give The Giver one out of five stars.
B00005QIPH|1.0|This is one of the most appropriately titled CDs in recent years. After reading so many glowing reviews of this disc and being buried in the media onslaught declaring The Strokes the next great rock n roll band, I was expecting something darned impressive when I slapped this on. What I got was warmed over Stooges, Velvet Underground and Television, played with precision and absolutely no heart. This isn't a rock band--it's a cruise ship act, suitable for cabarets and weddings. These boys should be playing VU covers for happy seniors. The only thing less impressive and more transparently calculated than this disc is The Strokes' stage presence. Man, they must love watching themselves on video--&quot;Did you see that? I have Iggy's old hair and I look so CUTE!&quot;
B00005Y228|5.0|I have not yet bought this CD. However, I just watched her &quot;Showgirl&quot; live concert from Sydney, Australia. Simply, terrific entertainment. Since I have never heard of her before, I presume she does not tour North America. But she should. Check your cable tv and see if this concert is scheduled. You will not be disappointed.
0553106635|5.0|So far, all three books have been excellent, but there are a few things I'd like to point out. They are frequently infuriating as so many pages lie between character threads. I sometimes forgot what was happening to a character by the time the story revolved to them again, sometimes well over 100 pages later, and had to go back for a quick refresher.<br />The stories are also quite sad, as you 'watch' well-developed and well-loved central characters get killed off in brutal fashion. What happens to the survivors is sometimes nearly as bad, so keep this in mind. If you want an upbeat story, look elsewhere. Also, be warned that this is definitely not fantasy along the lines of Jenifer Roberson or R.A. Salvatore. I'll have to wait a few years before I let my son read this series as some of the content is just too mature with adult language, sex, and violence (including rape).<br />Like a lot of good things, this series is a mixed bag because while it is very well-written and quite compelling, it is so dark that I almost regret having started it. But that's only because my favorite characters are now either dead or might be better off dead.
B00006690F|5.0|It seems far too easy to assume Marshall Mathers's success has come exponential up to the point of his career in which the greatest selling rap album of all time, 'The Marshall Mathers LP' was released, but it has. Since then Eminem along with his homeboys D12 released 'Devils Night' a collaborative joint effort that was more of a joke than anything quite serious. Recently, Em's first single and a rather empty song 'Without Me' hit radio waves giving everybody the same nonsense humor that many have come to know and love, but 'The Eminem Show' is exactly the opposite of 'Without Me' as Em takes off the mask and talks one-on-one with his fans through songs like 'Cleanin Out My Closet' which deals with the hardships Slim has endured with his mother to 'Sing For The Moment' a remix cover of Aerosmith's 'Dream On'. I first had doubted the deliverance of 'The Eminem Show', but after one listen it's evident that Mr. Slim Shady has topped the pinnacle of hip-hop with his unique blend of story-telling, humor and emotional rhymes. And he still doesn't give a [heck].
B00000IQMT|5.0|Great relaxing music. Sorry not a long review I'm tired. Just want to say that this is a must-have for any fan of the movies and also for people who like classical orchestral music. Get it! Good night...<br />PS: Maybe I'll edit this later if possible.
B00006690F|5.0|From Slim Shady LP to Marshal Mathers LP to The Eminem Show, this CD is clearly the best. The beats are on the slower side, but they are still very good and the lyrics are some of the best ever. In this album he is really talking about his life, and as long as you dont mind some disses on America you'll probably love this album too. <br />Buy this baby fast so you can get the limited edition DVD with it. It wont last long, only the first 2 million presses come with it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I had heard most of YHF on the internet.  They came through New Orleans on tour at the end of last year, with no release date for the album in sight.  Then the story breaks, the one everyone has heard by now and is understandably sick of.  God bless Nonesuch, I am thinking, and on April 23 I go and buy it.  Over the following weeks, I listen to it in my car on hours-long trips for work.  I listen to it alone in the living room.  I listen to it with friends in the living room.  On headphones in bed.  On headphones outside.  In the car.  Inside the house.  Drunk.  Sober.  Sleepy.  Wired.  Whatever.  When Sunday arrived I was thoroughly transfixed.  Tweedy and friends have created the logical successor to Being There and Summerteeth.  The atmosphere is apparent, and the hooks and melodies are there but blurred and submerged, making the album that much more addictive when one has taken the time to truly listen.<br />Anyone who buys this album, spins it once, and puts it on the shelf until the next bout of insomnia hits is missing the point and missing out.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot took time and takes time.  Do yourself a favor and listen CLOSELY.  And then listen again.  And again.  Maybe I'm crazy, but you'll see...
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is, in a word , spectacular.<BR>Not only does it triumph in it's perfect synthesis of heavy, beat-ladden pre('Glam) and proto-punk genres but does so with an almost scientific precision and utilization of premier studio technology.  Irresistable, Exurberant, relentlessly climactic, this album is almost too good to be true.<BR>OK. Enough already.  Picture Sham 69, the Ramones, Sweet, the Bay City Rollers and early Black Flag collaborating with Butch Vig and Phil Spector. Throw in a patina of ELO with the craft-consciousness of ABBA(and Chin-Chapman for good measure),a heaping tablespoon of Crystal, multi-layered Les Pauls and beats that can only be called \\"concussive\\" ...and Let 'er ROCK.<BR>And it works.  Effortlessly with a tongue-in-cheek reverance for the glam and punk vernacular it appropriates. Not to mention that the songs are infinitely gorged with hooks and wonderfully calculated pop craftmanship. \\"OY\\" meets the Twenty First Century.<BR>I dare say the only collection of music that really counts after the self- immolation and ultimate de-construction of Rock and Roll rendered the 'classical'trend obsolete(ie; SexPistols,Roxy Music,Ramones, Beasties etc).<BR>Also the songs are quite catchy. The Real Stuff.
0446310786|5.0|I had an aunt that took care of the children of her brothers and sisters (meaning my cousins, my brothers and I).  As a 8 year old child she had us watch the movie with Gregory Peck, it is in b/w.<br />When I was in the 9th grade (a freshman), this book was a requirement, but I knew it already from years before.  And I got an A where this book was concerned.  It's a true classic with life lessons to learn and remember.<br />Well my aunt died in January 2002 and I found the book and kept it as a momento (among other things) and I still remember watching the movie after all these years.  My aunt influenced all of us kids more than she knew.<br />Set in the small Southern town in Alabama, during the Depression, this book follows three years in the life of Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman.  Though her story explores big themes, Ms. Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up.<br />Ms. Lee takes awhile getting to the point of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from Dracula and coming up with ideas in how to get a glimpse of the boogyman down the street, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well in other things.  By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, To Kill a Mockingbird is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often by child and adults alike.
B00005JKED|4.0|&quot;Training Day&quot; rambles at times, and is quite bleak.  I can understand why it never took off at the box office.  Also, Washington is playing against type, portraying a really repulsive character with great gusto. Denzel received a well-deserved Oscar for his lurid and gritty performance. Ethan Hawke is terrific, too, as the rookie on Washington's beat.  Hawke makes a smooth transformation from eager puppy to disillusioned partner to horrified veteran that is both disturbing and convincing.  The claustrophobic atmosphere is intensified by the uneasy, yet hypnotic rapport between Washington and Hawke.  That said, &quot;Training Day&quot; is an interesting and totally absorbing film - but dark, dismal, and creepy.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I absolutely adore both the book and movie versions of this story, and Disc 1 of this boxed-set is 100% as good as it should be: it's an absolutely lavish transfer of the film, with rich vivid color, crisp picture, and excellent sound. Indeed, I think I had a better viewing experience with the DVD than in the really rather nice theater I saw the film in.<br />That said, Disc 2 was a MAJOR disappointment. Much of the content is just rehashed material from the film itself, and the interface is supremely irritating. Indeed, while first looking at it with two friends who are also great fans of the books and film, mere minutes of being assaulted by this lousy interface had everyone complaining loudly. There is no actual menu, and no direct way to access any of the supplementary material. To get to anything, you have to navigate through a series of screens relating to the story, and since nothing is labeled as to what it actually contains, you have to poke around endlessly to find anything interesting.<br />Also, there isn't a lot of interesting supplementary content for an adult audience. Most of it is geared toward children. While this is a children's story, it actually has more adult fans, and the content should have much better accounted for all ages.<br />Finally, the packaging of the set is horrible, flimsy cardboard. I would expect the outer box to last two seconds flat in the hands of children... and I don't expect it to last a terribly long time in the hands of adults.<br />In conclusion, this is a superb movie superbly transferred to DVD, packaged in a really lousy boxed set that I think you'll be very disappointed with if you want anything at all more than the movie itself.
1577311760|1.0|The concept that &quot;we live in the now&quot; is something I believe in.  The delivery of the audio would have put me to sleep if I continued to listen past CD #1 and I wasn't driving.  I do not recommend this book to anyone interested in getting motivated for personal growth.
B00005OAIE|5.0|In Room for Squares, John Mayer shows off his remarkable talent for guitar playing and songwriting. His songs are very down to Earth and understandable. His voice also shines on these tracks, often changing octaves and hitting interesting harmonies with his guitar. What a great CD this new artist has created, and I know many people would agree this guy has a lot of potential.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Brilliant movies make you question.  And this is a brilliant movie.  The reason this movie is great is obviously the acting, special effects, story, and of course, the two masterminds behind this project.  What make this movie brilliant, though, are the questions raised and finally answered as the long epic ends.  There are many of these in this movie and most have been reflected here.  However, I feel one important quandary has been left untouched.  The question:  Can the creator, whose creation was made to love the creator, love the creation?  This may raise some eyebrows, as this can be analogous of God as creator and humans as the creation.  If you do not want to read, as some may perceive as blasphemous, please refrain from reading any further, this is only my opinion.  My words will be judged when it is my time.  I just feel I need to say something, to get this off my chest.<br />The answer to this question is answered throughout the movie but really reaches finality when the epilogue ends, even though some may say an unnecessary epilogue.  My conclusion is that the answer is straightforward in the movie and tells us: No, the creator may be fooled into loving its creation for a while but in the end, the creator will not truly love its creation.  The creator will always be reminded that the creation is artificial.  You are to recognize throughout the movie that this is a robot but in some instances you may be fooled by its looks or its love.  Some people, notably film critic Roger Ebert, did not buy into these facades; this may be a flaw in the movie for some but shouldn't be the reason why not to recommend the film, it seems naive to do so...
6305165912|5.0|There is no way a list of top alltime comedies should leave off &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.  It more than Jeff Bridges and John Goodman in top form.  There are dozens of characters making significant contributions.  It all forms a complex collage that may not fit together 100%, but still creates great entertainment and plenty of laughs.  Furthermore, the comedy has a way of staying fresh in repeated watchings.  The DVD is a great investment as you'll be able to watch it again and again when your mood gets down and you require a comedic &quot;pick-me up&quot;.

B00005AQGH|5.0|2pac is the realest rapper. His talent just shows that. The Notorious B.I.G. can't compare to Pac's rap skills. He was the General in rap. If he was alive, rappers like Ja Rule, Jay Z and such rappers would not succeed.  Many people say the original Makaveli cd was greatly produced, but the digitally remastered is even produced better. just look at the title,\\"The 7 Day Theory\\", that tells you that this is tight.  Bomb First is the intro to this. This is the best intro ever. In this track you can understand that Pac was not trying to murder his enemies, but rather murder them lyrically. Hail Mary is one of favorite Pac songs. A tight beat, but odd and crazy lyrics, Pac raps with one of his sader voices. The next track is like a sequel to How Do You Want It. Toss it up features K Ci and Jo Jo. To Live & Die in L.A. could also be a sequel to California Love, without Dr.Dre though. Blashphemy is a tight song, but it is very mysterious, it is related to biblical things. Life of an Outlaw features the great Outlawz. They consist of Makaveli(R.I.P), Edi Amin, Young Noble, Kastro, Napoleon, Hussein Fatal, Kadafi(R.I.P), Storm, Mussolini, Khomeni. A love song filled with thug passion, Just Like Daddy is a Pac Tradition. Krazy is a deep song, showing his talent as a lyric writer. White Man'z World is a very deep song, talking about many political and struggling issues. This next song is amazing, one of his best tracks. Me and my Girlfriend, Pac raps about his girlfriend, but not in human form, just listen to it. Another on of those deep tracks, Hold Ya Head, Pac raps it ot the fullest, but sad though. A great diss songs, Against All Odds, a tight song, it has some weird meanings. The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory is the tight rap album. It has tight beats, lyrically amazing. All twelve tracks are classics. A true rap masterpiece. Rest in piece to the realest that ever breathed. Check out the Outlawz too. Buy 2pac albums. Eternally Pac will always breath in his heaven.
B00003CXGG|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie. It's east meets west in modern times. An ex-cop (Jet Li) escaped prison in China to find out who killed his brother in the U.S. He then meets the daughter of the suspected killer (Aaliyah) and then sparks fly. All hell breaks loose as romance developes between the two from opposite sides. There is action galore and lots of laughs. This movie shows of the many skills of Jet Li as a martial artist as well as an actor.
B00005JKBC|4.0|a very well done storyline, combined with great actors and action sequences.....there's nothing else to ask for...seriously, not one of the BEST flicks to hit DVD in 2002 but surely will do....Redford is brilliant....and of course, the the Pitt-meister plays his usual cocky, arrogant-self once again, except this time...he plays the GOOD guy instead of the BAD and awesome directing of course (tony scott)....and if you're still not convinced to go check it out....maybe the usual &quot;dvd special features and extras&quot; bribary routine will convince ya....and take it from me....this dve collector's edition is packed with em! cuz if the movie doesn't satisfy you, then go BEYOND it.....i would've given the flick a solid 5 stars but there were no HOTTIES in it (female hotties) that is, lol
0380789035|2.0|The basic flaw of this book was that the inherent disinterest that the protaganist, Shadow, has in the events happening around him gives the reader the impression that this aren't really amazing events and sho<br />There's a plethora of fascinating characters in this book, but there's no glue that binds the whole story together because the main character doesn't give a damn about anything. I was more interested in when the clunker was going to fall through the ice than anything else.  If the protaganist doesn't find interest in anything else in the book, why should I?
B000002MY3|5.0|16 million copies sold and I STILL think think the numbers do justice to this album. Everybody who listens to music should have this CD as part of their collection. Alanis has a simply mindblowing voice that exudes so much emotion, so much sincerity. Jagged Little Pill that will please everyone - from radio friendly material like \\"Head Over Feet,\\" \\"Hand In My Pocket,\\" and the timeless \\"Ironic,\\" to edgier, unadulterated rock, \\"Not the Doctor,\\" and \\"All I Really Want.\\" My personal favorites are \\"You Learn\\" and \\"Mary Jane.\\" I hope people who sidetrack rock music won't get disillusioned by this album for its hard, real sound - Trust me, you'll enjoy ...
B00005RYL9|4.0|Just got a chance to see &quot;The Immortal Edition&quot;.  To say that this is a better transfer than the initial DVD release is an incredible understatement.  Unlike the first DVD (where the MPEG artifacts had MPEG artifacts), this is a nice, clean anamorphic transfer that looks quite good on my 120&quot; screen.<br />The main menu is peculiar and has a somewhat irritating a/v segue between the top-level menus and the sub-menus, but it's usable.<br />My principal gripe with this disc is the &quot;director's cut&quot; edit.  In some ways, this edit improves the original US release by providing additional back story for some of the characters.  However, this cut also adds some other footage which, in my opinion, detracts heavily from the mysterious nature of the beginning of the movie.  They've also &quot;touched up&quot; some of the effects work in a couple of the battle scenes in a way that didn't add much.<br />The 5.1 remix (DD and DTS) also adds some gratuitous sound effects which I find distracting and actually (in the climactic sequence) detrimental to the movie.<br />So, in sum, this disc is a mixed bag.  I have ordered it after viewing a rental copy because the quality if the transfer is the best so far.  However, I wish I could have this transfer quality with the original edit (plus the WW-II sequence) and a true-to-the-original 5.1 mix.
B00006690F|5.0|eminem is backand better than ever. he still has the tightest flow in the game and is bangin out beats.i don't even know where to begin on saying how good this cd is but it definitely tops all his others
1878424319|5.0|This book changed my life in so many ways.  It is simple and straightforward and can help free the reader from his or her notions of Self simply by explaining them rationally.<br />Why do we feel badly about ourselves?  Can we improve, even after so many years of formation?  Why do we let others hurt us with their words and deeds?  Is there a way to not feel hurt when they do?  Is there a way to love others the way we are meant to, and to be selfless, ultimately?<br />The answer is:  Yes.<br />You do not have to be spiritual to learn from this book, just interested in knowledge.  The world is a hard place in which to live, and those we encounter can have everything to do with the hardness and the pain. Buy this book and learn how to navigate the stormy waters...and emerge unscathed and whole.<br />Peace.
B00005UEAR|4.0|I hate people who think of themselves as music critics....<BR>What is the problem with you guys... just let the music flow! It's not what you had expected... but it's their music.<BR>Some people said: &quot;no guitar solos&quot;.... what about misunderstood, the great debate or goodnight kiss's amazing solos?<BR>Other's said: &quot;Portnoy is losing it&quot; what?! his drumming is overwhelming throughout the entire CD.<br />It's probably not their best cd... but don't tear it down with critisism.<br />I agree with some people that said that the mixing is not good..., I don't like it either. But the sound is there.<BR>I agree with people that said that there should be some shorter tracks.... absolutely.<br />But if you listen to this CD and are not amazed buy the music wizardy they show, and the musicianship.... you know nothing about music.<br />It is an extraordinary album, period.
B00005QIPH|5.0|...I first saw the Strokes on Conan and they played a smoking Modern Age.  One of the guitarists was the spitting image of Jimmy Page as he went off into a blinding guitar solo.  Then there is the people who \\"don't get\\" Julian Casablancas garbled singing voice.  Well, Robert Plant didn't have the prettiest singing voice ever but look where it got him.  Okay, so you're tired of hearing Last Nite, but that's no reason to ignore all the other great songs on the album.  Hard to Explain has more melody than any other song written in the past 7 years can shake a tree at.  Modern Age never gets boring and Take It Or Leave It follows suit with a great vocal performance.  Someday is another great song, I can only find two songs on this CD that do not stand out and shout look at me!  Others complain that the songs all sound the same.  Like written in Rolling Stone, The Strokes are more about rhythm than anything else.  It dosen't shock me that people don't like this album with the state of music the way it is...

B00006690G|5.0|Before i start there is one key point about this album.  This is the most insightful album on the contreversal rapper 2 date.  He delievers his usual rapid flow that leaves u wondering where one bar ends and the next starts on all of the songs.  when i got this album i put it in my cd player and i still havent taken it out after 5 days all of the songs are amazing my favourites are \\"White America\\" \\"Business\\" \\"Cleaning ou my closet\\" actually i cant fault any of the tracks i love em all a highlight is em singing on \\"Hailies Song\\" where he sings and only on the last verse goes back 2 rappin.  So for any Hip Hop head or fan of Rap this is THE best album of this year so BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you'll thank me 4 it
B00006690F|3.0|...THERE'S NO MOUNTAIN I CAN'T CLIMB...THERE'S NO TOWER TOO HIGH...NO PLANE THAT I CAN'T LEARN HOW TO FLY...That is what Eminem is all about: Poking fun at the WTC tradegy and coming across as looking like what he has always been: the premier white rapper in America. From the blistering beats in \\"Business\\" (with Dr. Dre) to the sincere caring for his daughter in \\"Halie's Song\\", Eminem is angrier than ever before. Yet one can't help but feel the album isn't on the same level as The Marshall Mathers LP. Purists might argue not even on the same level as The Slim Shady LP. Most of the songs are serious and intense instead of the relaxed and whimsical performances we are used to.Will Eminem realize how great he can truly be if he'll just leave the trash talking alone and be himself. This is not going to be easy. It is by far the reason people are buying his music...LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS...I DON'T GOT NO TIME TO PLAY AROUND, WHAT IS THIS?...MUST BE A CIRCUS IN TOWN, SHUT THIS STUFF DOWN...

B00003CXI1|1.0|I loved the books.  I loved the movie.  My kid was rivited to the seat during the entire thing.  Then we tried to find the Never-Before-Seen footage that's supposed to be part of the package.  Let me warn you - thus far I've been unable to find any trace of the Never-Before-Seen footage on either of the DVD's in the set.  It's just not there.  There's no menu item pointing to it, and there's no indication of that content being on CD2 either.  If your hopes are up on seeing that extra footage, this DVD is not for you.  My son is very disappointed.  This disc contains no movie previews for other features and strangely enough, it lacks the FBI copyright message as well.  If you like to collect movies and want to add Harry to your collection, I'd advise waiting until WB updates the disk menus and includes the features they've left out.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem really gets into his personal life moe than ever in this album.  His full emotion is let out.  He talks about being sued by his former girlfriend Kim and his mother.  He also talks about other artists also.  The best songs are Say Goodye to Hollywood, Cleanin Out My Closet, Business, Superman, Haile's Song (a really really cool slow ballad, sort of backstreet boy like, and he sings in  it in the whole song!!!), Square Dance, My Dad's Gone Crazy...basically every song is good!  and the DVD rules
B00005NWZ2|3.0|My friend bought this version and the drop-out on Mambo Son stinks.......it sets the tone for disapointment.  The lack of lyrics bites too.  I bought the Japanese import for 25 bucks and this thing rocks.  It includes a picture disk with album style slip case.  The slip case, per the original album, has the lyrics on the back and includes a album sleeve just like an album.  Plus thier is another booklet with seperate lyrics as well.  It also includes a fold up mini poster of the original artwork from inside the lp with Marc in his chair.  Another booklet has Tony's pictures and notes on the album.  The sound quality is on par with todays digital recordings, which is excellent.  The Japanese sure know thier way around recording equipment.
B00000J6AG|3.0|This Moby CD is pretty good.  I bought the CD and thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of spins.  Over time, I realized that the CD is just good (versus pretty good).  I will not discount the fact that this CD brought electronic music to the commercial forefront (which is good, I guess).  I just thought there was a bit more hype on the CD than substance.
B000002PH1|5.0|I am more a fan of heavy metal and pop metal of the 80's.But,in 1988 when i heard the song &quot;heaven is a place on earth&quot; I was instanly introduced to a different gerene of music,and you know what,I LIKED IT!! this song has that catchy hair metal riff to it,so i started thinking this song would have been even bigger if it had been sung by a male pop metal group such as bon jovi or warant.If it had been,it would probably had been one of the greatest hair band songs ever written.The song stiil to this day sounds great and it doesn't get old.There are a bunchof good songs on this album but this one in particular is in a world of its own.

B00004SCX6|4.0|As queen of the pop princesses, Britney's singles keep piling up towards one heck of a sassy Immaculate Collection down the road.  With that in mind, her albums have to be considered in the light of those irresistible tunes and not the low-grade filler.  \\"Oops! . . .  I Did It Again\\" doesn't even have a ballad worthy of \\"Sometimes\\", which itself isn't up to the dreamy slow tunes of Madonna or the Spice Girls.  But what this record does have, far in excess of her debut, is a stellar handful of slamming pop tunes, delving further into the wicked aesthetic of \\"Baby One More Time\\" and the radio edit of \\"Crazy.\\"  The title track's merciless production goes beyond the frontiers of pop's most shameless excess, with beats aggressive enough to wake the dead (or perhaps animate a chestful of Barbie dolls) along with those sugary hooks that play up Britney's innocent/invincible persona with more wit (and less nastiness) than that memorable first ever single.  \\"Stronger\\" was one of what will doubtless be many songs to get billed as Britney's \\"Vogue\\" (i.e. breakthrough into some kind of higher artistic integrity); but integrity is the last thing her music needs-- \\"Stronger\\" is the \\"Express Yourself\\" of the Spears canon, a song even more blissfully swaggering with disco abandon than anything that has come before (or since).  And can we  forget \\"Lucky\\", the most transcendent kitsch the radio has ever offered?  Most of the rest of the album is filler, comparitively speaking, but it's stronger filler than before, and the glorious \\"One Kiss from You\\" is a melting slurpie of a puppy love anthem, batting eyelashes at you from across the floor of some rollerdisco dreamland.  Forgive her the \\"Dear Diary\\" doldrums, and hail our pop queen.  Vive la Britney!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|This is my favorite album and Tool is my favorite band. The music found on this masterpiece is different thatn anything else out there. If you're looking for some music that is more than just power chords, three minute songs, and lyrics that have no meaning then this is the right album for you(Don't get me wrong, I like metal too but I would choose this over it any day). I heard some [fool] call this nu-metal which it is not(he lumped it in with [bad] bands like slipknot and system of a down). I view Tool as a band who's music can't be categorized and If you can really appreciate the greatness of Tool's music then you probably will too. If you have a short attention span the don't buy this album because there are some pretty long songs on here. I love them but you might not if you think five minutes is long(which I asure you there are songs on here twice that long). Overall all the songs are great and the album is great.
0440539811|5.0|People love to point out, and attack, this book's muddled ideology, its ever-shifting style, its countless digressions, its violent swings between adolescent fantasies and serious philosophy, etc, etc, ad infinitum.  To these people, I can only say, \\"Duh.\\"  This book, like most things RAW has worked on, is A TEST.  It runs the gamut from Occultism to Solipsism to Libertarianism to Objectivism, and most of the things in between.  Through it all, the narrative refuses to attach itself to one specific outlook.  Why, you ask?    Well, the book has a surprise ending, that comes a couple months after you read the last page.  I didn't want to ruin it for you, but here goes: ...  Every twenty pages or so, Shea and Wilson try to win you over to a new belief system, only to tear it down a few pages later.  If any of it makes you a true believer, then you weren't paying attention.  Thinking for yourself has nothing to do with seeing fnords, finding erotic undertones in Catholic imagery, or getting yourself a Libertarian woman.  It certainly has nothing to do with accepting the existence of a massive global conspiracy.  Thinking for yourself is just that- maintaining a healthy skepticism, but keeping an open mind at the same time.  You can decide what you want believe, but you must also remember that you will never have the complete picture.    Sure, this novel (trilogy) provides a taste of hallucinogenic mind-expansion on its most superficial level.  But dig a little deeper and you'll find much more, not in the words of Shea and Wilson, but within (and possibly without) your own mind.  The biggest mistake you can make is to assume that 'Illuminatus' is the end of your journey, when it is probably just the first step.  This book is a tool for just that, the starter pistol that sets you on your own search (which, sadly, will probably not involve dolphins).    'Illuminatus' lays out a seemingly infinite number of red herrings for your perusal.  It is your job, as a good little reader, to find them all (hint: there's nothing that isn't one).    This is the obligatory 5th paragraph.  Superstition may not be useful, but it's fun.
B00000613T|5.0|I very much enjoy what conductor Pierre Boulez brings to any Mahler party.  I feel that his penchant for technical precision reigns in Mahler's slightly schizophrenic, stream of consciousness wanderings with grace and showmanship.  The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is tops on this recording.  The strings wash over the first movement like the first signs of autumn.  When the brass finally interrupt at the 3 minute mark you are hooked.  The woodwinds in the 2nd movement Landler are rich and glowing.  The Rondo-Burleske movement is a wonderful tossed salad of brass, stings and woodwinds percolating and churning.  The final Adagio is lush but not overly sentimental in its aching beauty.  Boulez takes a symphony full of dissonances and instead directs your attention toward the lyrical.  If the recording has one fault at all, its Deutsche Grammophon's lack of pick up in the bass register.  But the sound from Chicago is so rich that you will not be bothered by this at all.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem has gotten a lot more personal, and has stepped up his already perfected skills to a new level.  Sing for the Moment tells the entire world what music means to a true music fan.  All the beats are off the hook.  The lyrics are different from any other LP he has done, but they are by far the best.  The beats are kickin and he definately gets his point across.  This is the best rap album I have ever owned.  It's for rap fans as well as general people who can appreciate an excellent lyracist and has an appreciation for music
B00005JKJA|4.0|....Hmm, I watched it once in forward, then once in reverse, and it's pretty ... clear :)  If you want the short version, here it is - but see the movie, it's full of many great details! <br />The movie is a dream that the blonde has, after putting a contract out on her girlfriend.  Bada-bing!  I would say more, but Mulholland Drive is just too good to ruin with more detail.  Discovery is most of the fun.  Methinks though Joe Six will need this much help to discover the rest of the treasures.

B00005JKED|4.0|\\"Training Day\\" was one of the more emotionally charged dramas I've seen in awhile. David Ayer's writing coupled with Antoine Fuqua's direction were very strong along with the two important pieces of the puzzle, Oscar-winning Denzel Washington and Oscar-nominated Ethan Hawke. Washington's performance was incredible. This guy can be the most likeable of protaganists and then be the antagonist you just love to hate. Washington is the villain in this movie, and he is one mean character. Hawke is making a name for himself, being able to hold lead roles and here complimenting a truly great actor.<br />Washington plays Detective Alonzo Harris, a veteran cop who knows the streets - and literally lives by them and their rules. He is a corrupt cop with both ties nationally and inner-city gangs. Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a LAPD rookie who wants to become detective. Hoyt finds out with his first meeting with Harris that it will not be a usual first day. It will be a training day to remember. Hoyt and Harris' peronalities conflict greatly; Harris' believes in street justice while Hoyt is on the side of street protocol where suspects must be read their rights and give statements. That is not the life Harris lives anymore. The duo meets the Wisemen - three other corrupt cops high on the ladder, as well as stage a break in, which is actually murder. The movie spans the entire day, which in itself is tragic, terrifying, and confusing to Hoyt.<br />Washington delivers one of the best performances in his career, well worth the Oscar. His character runs through emotions like colors of the rainbow, one time being receptive and proud, while next being punishing and unrelenting. Hawke also impresses as the \\"good cop\\" having no idea how life is on the streets. His performance was also worthy of his Academy award nomination. \\"Training Day\\" is a true drama, with suspense, action, and heated dialogue. It's ironic, though, because most of Washington's lines were ad-libbed. The only drawback of this movie was that it was too emotional. That's all the movie fed on for the entire feature - raw emotion. You can only have so much of that before you hit overload. That time comes when Hoyt begins to hunt Harris near the end. By then, it's just too much.<br />\\"Training Day\\" is a great film and was a surprise. Denzel certainly steals the show. Hawke also is great showing us how most of us would react to such a reality check that Hoyt gets. This is a very strong movie that solidified Washington as a truly great actor and is helping Hawke up the ladder to success.
0767836286|4.0|I've rented this on VHS before September 11th and watched it alone. I was horrified and thrilled. Now I bought it on DVD and watched it after \\"the event\\" with my girlfriend. The impact of it was significantly lower (which is to be expected) after I saw Twin Towers crumble into dust.<br />Many, many movies dealt with terrorism, but none with such courage and, I dare myself say it, vision. <br />Those who characherize this movie as evil, bad and malignant are the same people who can't believe the pedofilia occures among thier priests and that Church was hiding it or that goverment, politicians and big company execs care about the people, the animals or the Earth itself. Those people are repeatedly going to be hit in the face with whatever life throws their way.<br />This movie is serious piece of work. It's not just a movie, but a movie with a message to America and americans to stop living in the state of mind that they are above the rest of the world.<br />Plot in a sentence or two: a recently widowed college professor holding classes on terrorism gets new neighbour he starts suspecting he's the anti-goverment terrorist. But is it just his paranoia over his dead wife or you know what...<br />The premise is intriguing and the performances are good, but not great. Some pathetic acting is evident and some characters could've been developed better. Tension is built slowly and gradually, stopping here and there to (successfully) take you off track.<br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent movie with great finale, far better than  the most of today's Hollywood brainless junk.<br />The DVD itself is rather good (with alternate endings and commentary), but the sound is rather weak - it looks like it was lip-synched afterwards in the studio without real care. High tones are somewhat metallic and deep bass in non-existant. That's the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars.<br />Rent it first, and if you like it - buy it.<br />Favourite line: \\"She got in the way...\\"
B000006XSD|2.0|This would be the last Alice Cooper album that Bob Ezrin would poduce before returning on Da Da in 1983. When you are familiar with the previous Alice-Ezrin collaborations such as Love it to Death, Killer, Billion Dollar Babies and Welcome to my Nightmare you will be surprised that Bob Ezrin actually produced this album. It's probably the worst Alice Cooper album ever.<br />Actually the album opens up pretty well with \\"It's Hot Tonight\\" which has a very catchy guitar riff. It's a good song and one of the best here. \\"Lace and Whiskey\\" is another fun song about Alice and his alcohol addictions. Actually this is the story of some Maurice Escargot, a detective character Alice portrayed on the album. Road Rats is another fast song which is not too bad but still very far away from the stellar Alice Cooper group efforts.<br />Damned if You Do is a stupid song and it's where everything on this album starts going wrong. Disco is much more evident than rock n roll here and that is something you totally wouldn't expect from Alice Cooper. You and Me was a smash top ten hit in the US and ended up bein covered by Frank Sinatra, but when compared to other Alice ballads like the earlier \\"I never Cry\\" or the later \\"Might as Well be on Mars\\" and \\"Every Woman Has a Name\\" this one is still not up there with them.<br />The next four tracks are so bad that I doubt I have ever listened to them in full in over a year. It's 50s rock. The lyrics to I Never Wrote Those Songs might not be so bad but the music here is not good at all. Ubangi Stomp is an elvis-like song and No More Love at Your Convenience is disco at its worst. Alice himself says it's the only song he's semi-ashamed of recording. The closer is decent when compared to the rest. <br />That said there are only 4 songs actually worth listening to here, which are \\"It's Hot Tonight\\", \\"Lace and Whiskey\\", \\"You and Me\\" and \\"My God\\". Luckilly no other Alice Cooper effort is half as bad as this.
0876855575|5.0|I guess it all stands to this with Bukowski, can you find humor associated with drinking? And do you mind something funny mixed with something tragic? If you can, then this author will please you. <BR> He never battled with drinking, he loved it. He wrote some beautiful poetry and entertaining autobiographical novels. The novels based on his life go from birth to end as follows, HAM ON RYE, FACTOTUM, POST OFFICE, WOMEN, HOLLYWOOD. This book is from his birth until the age around 21. <BR> I would not recommend this book to my mother, because she finds alcoholism a disease and very tragic. I also do sometimes find it tragic, but at times find it funny to follow the exploites of a gifted drunken bum. I have read most of his books many times.
0446608955|5.0|A friend of mine got me into reading Nicholas Spark's books about a year ago and I found myself a little embarrassed taking them to classes with me to read in between lectures, as they are mostly geared towards women, but I still enjoy them.<br />I found this one to be my favorite so far (Compared to the Notebook and Message in a Bottle).  It is a different touch for Sparks as he usually writes about adults.  I will not review what the book was about, as I'm sure there have been plenty of reviews you can check out that have, but I will say the book was absolutely wonderful.  Yes, it is very cheesy and cliche-ish, but, it reminds me of a saying, \\"Kill them with kindness\\" and that's what this book does.  It is so straight forward and cliche-ish, that you can't help but like it and have it touch your emotions.<br />From a guy that doesn't read much at all, I rarely recommend things, but, this is one I can feel comfortable recommending for anyone...<br />Ps...as with most things...do check the book out before the movie, even though the movie is nicely done as well.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Ok, so that title of one of the world's best movies ever sounds hokey.  I do not care.  I grew up with the music of the 60's and 70's, and this movie makes me feel like I am there again.  I have watched it over and over...both versions, and even watched the entire movie witht eh directors comments running.  I am not tired of it and think that five or ten years from now I will enjoy it every bit as much as I do now.  This movie gets my highest recomendation, buy it and enjoy!!!!!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I had honestly never heard of this film when I saw it earlier this year for a film class in college.  We watched the film in our &quot;technical issues&quot; part of the class, and after seeing the film you will see why.  The cuts from scenes and other cinematography will either interest you further in the movie, or turn you away.  Yes, sometimes the &quot;cuts&quot; as you will see, can get a little disturbing and annoying, but, they begin to wear on you and become part of the movie.<br />I recommend this movie for that reason, to see the chance the film makers took on what could have broken the movie.<br />However, this film, as a lot of people have pointed out, is not for the weak hearted.  At the end you will find yourself, speechless and with a feeling of, most likely sickness.  Because of this reason, I recommend seeing it.  I read one review in which stated, the point of all movies should be to leave you speechless at the end.  I strongly disagree, but this is still a movie that should be seen, as long as you can handle the material.<br />However, just for pure taste perhaps the end sequence of Jennifer's character at the party could have been taken out, I understand why they put it in, but, if you are showing it for a class or with teens, perhaps you want to check out the edited version.
B00000DG1R|2.0|All of Duran Duran's greatest songs on one disc? Great idea. Too bad it's impossible to accomplish with an 80-minute time limit. In this attempt to do it, several of the band's best works were left off, including &quot;Careless Memories,&quot; &quot;Too Much Information,&quot; and the brilliant &quot;The Chauffer.&quot; Several of the tracks are also edited versions of the originals, and poor edits at that. There are several import collections that represent Duran Duran's work much better than this. Hopefully a 2-cd set or a multi-CD box set will eventually be available here in the US.
B00002IJ48|5.0|In the start there is about 10 minutes of footage before the band became famous, and between the videos there are clips of the band being silly and having fun.  If you are a fan of the band, I would definetly invest in this video.  You wont be sorry.

B00003CX5P|3.0|Well  -  it's not as bad as Return of the Jedi, but then what is?<br />George Lucas completely reinvented Star Wars for a new generation, starting with this glorified kids' movie.  And that is its greatest flaw:  it's made for kids.  And, pretty much, for kids alone.  The original series was made for adults, but inclusive of kids  -  this new series is made for kids, and not of great interest to adults.<br />In the movie's favor, the effects are incomparably good, as is only to be expected.  The action is fast and furious, the pod race and the concluding robot battle especially.  The light sabre duel with Darth Maul, and his phenomenal acrobatics throughout, are almost worth the price of admission alone.<br />But the film is dreadfully short of substance, even for a Star Wars entry.  The characters are mere sketches, not fully developed individuals.  When Obi-Wan met his demise at the hands of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars in 1977, the audience gasped.  When one of the Jedi Knights is similarly dispatched in The Phantom Menace, there is less any kind of emotional impact than the mere passing thought, \\"Well, I guess he zigged, when he shoulda zagged.\\"  The spectacle is still present  -  indeed, vastly improved  -  but the heart and soul of the series just isn't there.  Worst of all, the Jedi Knights themselves, who seemed so glamorous and exciting twenty years ago, in this installment (and in the following Attack of the Clones) come off more as a self-important organization consisting of pompous superiors and obsequious underlings.<br />If you're looking for something for junior at Christmas, look no further.  If you're planning on watching it with him, however, look for something else.
0061007137|4.0|One of the better works by Jeffrey Archer - I'm not terribly keen on the political themes that recur in some of his books, but \\"A Matter of Honour\\" is a thoroughbred thriller about a high-stakes game between international espionnage organisations. <br />The year is 1966, and the Soviet Union stands to deal the United States a humiliating defeat. A long-forgotten codicil to the treaty by which the United States bought Alaska from Russia would allow the Soviet Union a single opportunity to recover the territory - by purchasing it back for 100 times the purchase price, or 720 million dollars, after 99 years. President Andrew Johnson could never have forseen the difficulty in which he would one day place President Lyndon Johnson - who's not at all willing to become the first American leader to preside over a reduction in the size of his nation's territory<br />There's only one problem: the Soviets have lost their copy of the treaty. It's hidden an ancient Russian icon, itself locked in a Swiss safety deposit box. That icon, in turn, has just been mysteriously bequeathed to Adam Scott following the death of his father. As Adam moves to clear up questions surrounding his father's life, the Soviets dispatch Alex Romanov to retrieve the icon. Romanov is himself a very complex and dangerous character, a man whose loyalty to the regime he serves will be undermined by the very memory that he IS a Romanov. This book never slows down, and you'll never forget the scene when the safety deposit box is opened for the last time.
0679735259|5.0|More about the mind than war - Herr's Dispatches is for the unconventional. If you're looking for an epic tome, look elsewhere; Dispatches is for those with just enough cross-wiring to be able to drop into its disjointed self. An introspective yet open rock and roll account of the Rock 'n' Roll generation at war, it left me breathless at the end. At the top of my favorites list.
0688170528|5.0|Five friends and myself have read this book together and we all agree that's it's incredible! I read the entire thing in one day. It was impossible to put down.

I definitely recommend this book to everybody, especially teenagers such as myself. I plan on reading more from this author.

0790751089|4.0|I viewed Hollywood's adaptation of Robert James Waller's \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" last evening. I had seen the film initially some years ago and regarded it as much ado about nothing for the most part at that time.<br />But I was struck in this new viewing more than before by the universality of Francesca Johnson's dilemma. Perhaps maturation and recent life experiences have generated a heightened understanding and awareness on my part.<BR> <BR>Robert Kinkaid possessed a few of the qualities that have both inspired and dogged me during my middle years.<BR> <BR>He was a rootless writer and photographer, as well as a keen and cynical observer of the human condition. Kinkaid had been far and done much. He had seen and experienced multiple facets of life and love and possessed limitless anecdotal knowledge of the world. He offered much to Francesca in terms of sensitivity, understanding, appreciation of beauty and companionship that she would never find on an Iowa farm.<br />But Kinkaid lacked Middle America's major indicators of success and worthiness--roots sunk deeply in one geographic location, a home and real estate, and most importantly, a traditional Cleaver family mind set.<br />Francesca reluctantly opted for the Cleaver family syndrome, choosing security and safety over fascination, inspiration and love. She lived out her years with a boring Iowa pig farmer, remaining a lonely and empty woman with nothing but tattered memories of her brief encounter with Kinkaid.<br />Had I been writing the screenplay, I would have had her fling open that truck door and dash through the rain storm to head west with Robert Kinkaid.<BR> <BR>For better or worse, that's the impulsive sort of decision that has governed my life more often than not.<br />But such actions and those who take them do not comfort the psyche of Middle America's puritanical heartland.<br />Though they know better from their own experiences and those of others, the majority of Americans--middle classprotestant ones especially--prefer to keep their heads safely in the sand about life and the human condition, pretending still in a little house on the prairie dream world that probably never was--one that most certainly doesn't exist now.<BR> <BR>All is well in this delusional world of make believe--one that's filled with Little League games, soccer moms, church suppers and PTO meetings. Marriage and family are still the rocks of civilization and the ostriches are \\"saved\\" and bound for Heaven. Their president, George W. Bush, is a worthy man with a commission from their God to root out homosexuality, abortion and Islam.<BR> <BR>In my opinion, such as they dwell in the outer limits of utter darkness, living and dying without a clue about the past, the present, or the future. They're not living--they're merely existing in a state of perpetual denial, awaiting the flat line and the rude awakening that will likely follow.<br />Thoreau wrote, \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is termed resignation is confirmed desperation.\\"<br />Francesca Johnson completed her life journey in this condition of quiet desperation. I think that's a damned shame. I wanted more for her. I wanted her to go with Robert Kinkaid and seek a few years of happiness and joy while they each had the time and opportunity.<br />D. ...
0671027344|5.0|This has been the most \\"real\\" book I have ever read. I am 18, and when I read this book, it took me back a few years to when I was 15 and 16 and going through the same things Charlie was. Smoking pot, drinking, smoking, loving... everything your typical, rebellious teenager does. The way the book is written out, in letter form was also very brilliant on Stephen's part. What a wonderful way to catch a reader's attention! After reading the book, in which I read in only one day at school, I downloaded the song \\"Asleep\\" by The Smith's, and I totally understood the way Charlie related to the song. It is now one of my favorites. When I have children, this will definately be a book I will share with them.

0451196716|5.0|I began reading The Long Walk understanding the plot from friends recommending it. After reading a hundred pages I wondered if I could finish it.  Stephen King writes so vividly you feel as if you were a contestant. Your feet hurt and you become tired and hoping most not to get a ticket.  Once kids begin getting thier tickets I was horrified.  Then King allows you to become acquanited with the lead characters and you cheer &quot;Maines Own&quot;. Every step you are with them. I have read almost all of Stephen Kings works and I loved this one.  It is on my top ten list.  Another excellent book by the king of horror.

B00004TJK2|1.0|I sat down to watch a what i thought was going to be a fascinating and enjoyable film. It turned out to be an over long disappointment which doesn't seem to go anywhere in particular and soon becomes boring. I have now resigned this film to the trash can. If you are thinking of buying this film because of Jean Reno's fine acting and humour, in films such as LEON and GODZILLA. Then don't bother. Jean Reno is a favorite actor of mine but this film was a complete waste of time and talent.
B00004XONN|5.0|Don't let the &quot;reviews&quot; in the spotlight section throw you off- this album will go down as one of the most influential cds of the decade.  For the brainless pop-oriented masses (many whom have reviewed this album on this very site), KID A shatters rock forever.  <br />Everyone saw this coming after OK COMPUTER, one of the best albums of the '90's.  KID A shatters the boundries of rock and blends it with experimental electronica and mind-bending lyrics.  It may take you a few listens (it took me three) before you recognize the brilliance and innovation of this album, but it will hit you if you open your mind and have some patience.  <br />This album will open doors to all branches of music and Radiohead's follow-up AMNESIAC is another fantastic glimpse into the future of rock.  You may want to start with OK COMPUTER, and work your way up to KID A.  Just don't miss it.  But as it's legend grows over the next decade, I don't think you can.
B00005U18E|5.0|Last year, in my class at women's college where I teach, I quoted the name of this film, as one of the best I saw of that year; yes, I talked about this delightful romantic comedy \\"Briget Jones's Diary.\\"  The reaction from students, all twenty-something females, was, as it turned out, pretty loud, a sort of approving \\"ohhhh.\\"  They thought, probably, I, thirty-something MALE teacher, would not be seeing this film.  <br />Guys, (and this case, meaning males only) I say, \\"Don't think that the film is made for only \\"girls.\\"  That the film is based on Helen Fielding's bestselling books is nothing but its origin, and the film adaptation is more than what you expect, that is, more than just a descriptions of daily life of female office workers.  Not interested?  OK, you may ignore my advice, but I guess it's not a bad idea for any of us to get the inside view of vulnerable sides of those females working next to you, or walking on streets of London with their confident strides, apparently strong and independent.  And that is especially when delectable Renee Zellweger is Briget, heavy-smoking thirty-something, with no boyfriend, but with her own honest views on works, sex, and life.<br />One day Briget Jones meets her love, or thinks she meets one, in Daniel, her boss in the publishing company she is working at.  It started with an e-mail message from him, which was  tinged with slightly sexually harrassing comment on her skirt, but, hell, who cares! when Daniel is played by typically English handsome beau Hugh Grant.  Oh, but she should have known better.<br />Then, enters grim Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who doesn't seem to know how to smile, who had once encountered Briget at the awful curry party (where he showed up in an eqaully awful sweater).  Behind his off-putting attitudes, however, it comes out later, there is something warm and human, but it takes time for her to learn that, and for true love to triumph.<br />As practically every British people know, the name of \\"Darcy\\" is inspired by Jane Austen novel \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" and in acclaimed BBC TV adaptaion of that novel, Colin Firth played the namesake Darcy, an epitome of British gentleman, grossly misunderstood by the heroine.  As this BBC production was written by Andrew Davies, who also credited as one of the co-writers of \\"Briget,\\" it is inevitable for us to compare those two works, and there are at several points intentional allusions to this classic book in the film.  Perhaps Firth himself may loath to be typecast, but he is no doubt suitable for the role.  So is Hugh Grant, who plays this irresponsible twit Daniel, but, actually, he played the similar character (who repeats a favorite phrase \\"the thing is\\") in \\"An Awfully Big Adventure\\" (1995) alongside with Alan Rickman.  Check out if interested.<br />But the real treasure of the film is, as you know, Renee Zellweger, whose presence, literal and metaphorical, dominates the world of Briget Jones.  She is the one you can always relate to, male or female, and whatever she thinks or does would reveal those secret things deep in the hearts of those \\"girls\\" at your office, with lovely Renee always making you laugh and care for her, and if you're really working like her, most of all, look at your own life.  If you're a kind of person who wants to throw things at TV while watching \\"Ally McBeal\\" or \\"Sex and the City,\\" don't worry.  Briget's down-to-earth character would never make you.<br />And another joy is spotting some of the celebrities; two famous writers appear at a party scene, and look for Honor Blackman, \\"Bond-girl\\" in \\"Goldfinger,\\" and the first partner of John Steed in still popular 60s British cult TV series \\"Avengers.\\"
1590710037|2.0|the best thing about this book is the hardback binding with its cool sparkly cover.  the contents are pithy, but mundane.  there are no new observations on making art. his insistent personification of fear and making is sad.  there are much better book about overcoming resistence and making art.  but if you like pretty sparkly things, you'll love the cover.
B0000026J6|5.0|The singalong melodies of \\"Manhattan\\", \\"Aint No Cure\\" and \\"Everybody Knows\\" contrast well with Cohen's trademark preoccupation with romantic despair and judeo-christian imagery as in: \\"It's written in the scriptures, it's written there in blood ...\\" or \\"everybody's got this broken feeling/Like their father or their dog just died.\\" John Bilezikjian's oud adds a special dimension to \\"Everybody Knows.\\" The elegant \\"Take This Waltz\\" is a lilting song that brings the Vienna of Federico G. Lorca to life in a series of vivid images underpinned by a fervent longing for the beloved. The brilliant arrangement is enhanced by Raffi Hakopian's violin and the voice of Jennifer Warnes. The wistful \\"I Can't Forget\\" has been covered by The Pixies, while \\"Tower of Song\\" has been interpreted by artists as diverse as Marianne Faithfull, Robert Forster and Nick Cave and lent its title to the 1995 tribute album [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen]]. I'm not crazy about either the experimental \\"Jazz Police\\" or the title track, but I am evidently wrong since \\"I'm Your Man\\" has been covered by Elton John and Bill Pritchard.
B000002NJS|5.0|I've heard some of Madonna's other work (including &quot;Music&quot; which I also have) and this is her best work...ever.  The title track is just peppy enough so that it gives the Madonna signature song to the album.  The other songs that are just plain good are: Drowned World, Skin, Sky fits Heaven, To Have not to hold and Swim.  <br />Now there are a couple of &quot;experimental&quot; songs on the album such as: Candy Perfume Girl, Shanti/Ashtangi, Nothing Really Matters and Mer Girl - but they are not so weird or overpowering that they ruin the album.  Quite to the contrary, I think they add to the album greatly. <br />For the final BEST two songs of the album are: Power of Goodbye and Frozen.  Power showcases her impeccable way of mixing her voice with the electronica and it works perfectly.  Now, Frozen has to be my favorite Madonna song period.  It is just that great.  They lyrics are simple but they speak scores.  The backround music is moody and enhances the feeling of the song.  <br />Ray of Light is her best work to date.

630575067X|3.0|Okay, I won't argue with anyone who says that this is a mediocre installment in the STAR WARS cycle. Yes, I agree with those who would love to see Jar Jar Binks fried in a nuclear reactor. But after pondering this movie long and hard and weighing it in comparison to the other \\"episodes,\\" I have to come to the conclusion that it's a slightly paler version of the very first STAR WARS movie released long, long ago in two-and-a-half decades far, far away. Meaning that, IMHO, had \\"The Phantom Menace\\" been released in 1977 and \\"A New Hope\\" come out in 1999, the chances are pretty good that we'd be saying the latter film was the stinker while the former was the new, exciting film masterpiece of sort-of science fiction. What's the common denominator? George Lucas wrote and directed both these installments.<br />Look, you can love the STAR WARS mythos all you want and only a grinch would say that George Lucas doesn't have a vivid imagination. What he also has is a tin ear for scripted dialogue, an inability to craft an engaging narrative and a love of style that crushes substance. There's a reason why \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"The Return Of The Jedi\\" work as well as they do. Irwin Kirschner, Richard Marquand, Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan were able to give flesh and blood to Lucas' cosmos and MAKE YOU CARE ABOUT IT. After getting past the \\"golly gee\\" aspects of the \\"A New Hope\\" that so wowed us all in 1977, only an apologist would be unable to admit that the dialogue was flat and corny beyond belief and that the only reason the acting wasn't equally as bad is that Sir Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and Peter Cushing wouldn't allow it to be. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher improved phenomenally once Kirschner and Marquand were at the helm; in the first movie, they were as one-dimensional as Jason Lloyd and Natalie Portman are in this one. All by way of saying that, his baby or not, George Lucas should've stuck with laying out the concept and let others do the heavy lifting on this movie. He ain't got what it takes as either a writer or a director, at least not as a director of ACTORS (He's pretty good with animated creations, I must confess).<br />That said, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is an entertaining if not extraordinary two-plus hours. The high-tech hijinx certainly is where Lucas feels most at home and those parts of the film (such as the race on Tatooine) are exciting to watch. But, see, so was the battle at the location of the Death Star in the first film. Lucas does all that stuff just great; it's with directing people that he screws up. Maybe he should tag-direct with another director, say, an Anthony Minghella or a Sam Mendes. Then maybe this leg of the STAR WARS cycle would have some of the heft of the previous one. The present set-up doesn't work.<br />Finally, it's telling that the last film Lucas did that concentrated on people---and WORKED!---was \\"American Graffitti,\\" almost thirty years old. It had a small budget, was shot in about a month-and-a-half and still does a brisk business. Think about it, George.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbuster stars Bill Muary and Dan Aykoyd and is funny.  The ghostbusters hunt ghosts in the great city of New York.  Simply, the best of the two movies.<br />  How can you not like this comedy?<br /> One of my favorite lines is  \\"Is this a trick question?\\"
B0000025DR|4.0|This is a solid effort for Jeff Lynne, not his best work, But worth owning if you are even a mild ELO fan.  Although \\"A New World Record\\" was probably one of the best albums produced by this band, this one has several good songs like \\"fire on High\\" and \\"the evil woman\\" which makes it worth adding to your collection
0446678430|5.0|If you are on a quest for financial literacy, this is a must buy foundation book for your treasure chest. This is  Robert Kiyosaki at his finest. Skip the drivel from the ignorant naysayers who carp about the author's writing skills. They are  right, it's not scholarly. Thank goodness! I'm a member of MENSA but personally, I prefer it like it is - readable.<br />In Retire Young, Retire Rich, Kiyosaki is hitting his stride. This book is smoother and more advanced than his past books. So much so, that I strongly recommend that you read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and Cashflow Quadrant first. I found it so thought provoking that it was hard to read more than a few pages at a time without going &quot;Ah-Ha!&quot; and mentally zooming off to ideas on how I could apply it, right now, today.<br />In 1980, I graduated at the top of my class and I've spent over twenty years developing my financial knowledge base. But I can tell you, I've learned more from Kiyosaki about the fundamentals of financial literacy than from any other single influence. I heartily recommend that you read this book.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I watched the concert in a TV broadcast and I'm waiting for the European version of the DVD to be shipped right to my place. <br />I have to say I'm an unstoppable and more than enthusiast fan of Britney's, but not only because she is a great performer/entertainer, she can dance amazingly, she's really beautiful; I'm also deeply convinced all her songs are truly outstanding and she's got an incredible voice: if you don't believe me, listen to such tracks as \\"Born To Make You Happy\\", \\"Where Are You Now?\\" or, in the Japanese version of \\"Britney\\", \\"Before The Goodbye\\": with her voice she can do things that never stop giving me goose bumps!!!! <br />Well, I don't know whether she lip-syncked or not during part of the concert, but I know SHE SURE CAN SING!!!! And I think she generally doesn't lip-syncs in concerts: Mariah Carey was at one of the dates of the tour and said HER VOICE CAN KEEP A GREAT COMPOSURE AND SHE DOESN'T LIP-SYNC AT ALL!!!! Believe good ol' Mariah!!! <br />And for those who say it is just a show, not a concert, I think THIS IS what all concerts should be: otherwise, what is the difference between listening to the singer performing her songs live and listening to the CD at home, beyond being close to the artist in the first case? <br />Britney is THE ONE AND ONLY QUEEN OF MUSIC and she will enjoy more and more success now and in the years, decades, centuries, ... to come, because that's what she deserves for her incredible contribution to music and her presence on earth!!!
B00005JKCF|4.0|Spiderman to me was just a good movie.<BR>For One Thing, I could not see what the Critics saw in this movie. I mean I could  have just sat at home and watched the 1970s Batman Show and get the same rush. This movie was supposed to have more action than \\"Star Wars Episode II.\\" But all it really was, was about a guy that gets bitten by a super-spider and turns into Spiderman who is suddenly caught in a struggle between the Green Goblin the whole entire movie. Maybe I'm wrong about this movie, but for now my Rating for this Movie is:<BR>8.2 out of 10
B00005Y228|5.0|I love the upbeat songs on Fever (especially 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head.)  They are fun to dance and sing along to, and she has a great voice.  It's one of my favorite albums, and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B000001FS3|5.0|There is very little one can say about this album. It did so much, inspired so many, touched so many more. It was, and remains, a masterpiece--contrary to popular belief, it truly is U2's greatest work. That makes it the greatest album in history.<br />That's right. There is no other way to comprehend this album in words. It will uplift you, fill your soul. It will rock, and it will captivate. It will give you an adrenaline rush, and it will bring tears to your eyes--all in the space of a few seconds. It must be heard:<BR> <BR>The spiraling synthesizers leading off the lightning-speed finger-picking of &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name,&quot; <br />The political fury of &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky,&quot; <br />The anthemic sound of &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; <br />The raw emotion of &quot;With Or Without You,&quot;<br />The serene beauty of &quot;One Tree Hill,&quot;<br />The inspiring chorus of &quot;Red Hill Mining Town,&quot;<br />And so much more, undiscovered...<br />No other masterpiece will touch this, not Aenima, or Demanufacture, or Master Of Puppets, or Burn My Eyes, or Appetite For Destruction, or Paranoid, or Led Zeppelin IV, or Synchronicity, or Arise, or Reign In Blood, or Siamese Dream, or Dark Side Of The Moon, or the White Album. Nothing. <br />I present U2's The Joshua Tree.
B000000OU6|1.0|The coolist thing about this cd is that sinister cartoon snake on the cover.I can listen to ain't life grand,ssp's second release over and over again,that one I would give ten stars,this one I can't get through once.two different singers two different bands,get ain't life grand.
0425173739|5.0|I had never read an Agatha Christie book when I picked this up, and to tell you the truth, I honestly was positive I would be bored out of my mind. So on a rainy Saturday afternoon, I sat down to read it, and get my book report over with.<BR>WOWI sat in that chair for 2 straight hours, reading it from begiinning to end, and being captivated the whole way. This is an excellant mystery, with all kinds of surprises weaved in. I'm not going to tell you a single thing, because your going to have to read it for yourself to honestly appreciate this novel.<BR>So in Conclusion,<BR>READ IT!
B000007OY0|5.0|My preceding review critic (the viewer from the truth) not only missed the mark, he (she)_ failed to hit the board at all. Stephen Kings masterpiece transended to the film version a terrific cast which fielded a great uplifting story. Andy Dufrane ( Tim Robbins )  was the by most standards a middle class sucess story until his life was turned upsidedown by a cruel twist of fate. The twist is that the redemption so much sought after by the viewer turns out to be something other than Andy's freedom. The story actually chronicles the transformation of life time inmate &quot;Red&quot; played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. The political line within the corrections facility plays out in true to the audience and enables the viewer to keep cheering for the underdog, no matter what the senerios. The story is fantastic and solidified with well chosen actors. It's a movie with an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; flavour and it delivers the true meaning of HOPE. A true 5 star feature worth seeing more than once. At least 30 times for me.
B000002JSJ|4.0|I hate to say it since its such a cliche now, but anything after Physical Graffiti would not seem like LZ's best work.  Presence is actually a much stronger album than it is perceived to be, even since it was recorded quickly and Robert Plant's vocals are weaker than any other album.  Obviously, this is not their best, but it certainly beats In Through the Out Door.<BR>A lot of the songs here bleed into each other, they all for the most sound like the same song.  But some of LZ's best songs are scattered on Presence, ignored because they were placed here, rather than Physical Graffiti or Zoso.  Achilles Last Stand, the opening track, rivals Stairway as their best epic song.  The drums in here are better than Bonzo ever demonstrated before or after.  And the closing track, Tea for One, was their best blues-like song, which doesn't get dull though it pushes ten minutes in length.<BR>The rest of the album is decent, but, as I hate to say again, another cliche, ITS STILL ZEPPELIN.  Much better than other music now.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Orson Welles' masterpiece, Citizen Kane, has been named as the #1 Motion Picture in history a countless number of times, including by the American Film Institute. It takes a damn good movie for such a feat, but is all the hype worth it? In my opinion, YES. This is without a doubt the greatest movie I've ever seen, and likely ever will see. Everything from the development of the story, to the direction, and incredible visual effects, all of which revolutionized film-making as we know it today, is flawless and it never lets the viewer go until the final scene. Boring? Maybe, if you're strictly into high action-filled movies. My son, who is 15, saw this movie, and couldn't understand why it was so important. I have been studying film for many years, and that's what made the difference. Before you watch it, I recommend you see or read about how unique this movie really is before you watch it, so you can understand the tiniest of nuances. Some may find it boring, and it's black-and-white palette doesn't make it seem so tempting, but believe me, if you have ANY interest in film at all, this movie is DEFINITELY a MUST-BUY. This is cinema's finest achievement ever, and the greatest masterful epic in film history. Period.
B00006690F|5.0|I have to give props to eminem on this one. The Eminem Show is denfinately more emotional than we have ever seen Eminem before. Compared to past albums, the Slim Shady LP was a sort of \\"kiddy yet artistically developed\\" album; the Marshall Mathers LP was very \\"in your face\\"............but this one really gets deep into Eminem's head. Listen to tracks like \\"Hailies Song,\\" which is dedicated to his daughter where he releases the emotion and love that he holds for his daughter. But, there's also the hard-hitting, verbally attacking Eminem ont he album no doubt. Listen to tracks like \\"Till I Collapse\\" (which features Nate Dogg on the chorus), or \\"Soldier\\", where we witness Eminem at stages of fine lyricism. Personally, I believe that this and the Marshall Mathers LP tie for the spot for Eminem's best album...........but this is the side of Eminem that we've never seen before...............doesn't that count for something?
B00006690F|5.0|I found all the songs on a music downloading program. When I heard them I couldn't believe it. After his last cd I started to get sick of Eminem when he came out with D12 and everything but now he's back! This cd is his best yet. The lyrics are better and the background music is awesome. He isn't as mad anymore either. His lyrics aren't as offensive but they are more meaningful now and everything about this cd is better. The best songs are, Superman, Soldier and Hailies Song. If you liked his last albums you'll love this. And if you didn't you'll probably love it anyway.
B000060P79|5.0|Yesterday I went to a Simple Plan concert in Portland, OR and they are amazing live!  It was a festival-type concert, so they only played a few songs.  As soon as they were done, I went over to the CD booth and bought No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls.  I got it signed by them and they were really nice too.  I was excited to go home and listen to the CD, and it's one of my new favorites.  I like to consider this a mix of Green Day and Good Charlotte.  All of the songs on this are excellent.  As a teenager, I can really relate to a lot of this stuff, and it's really not too pop-ish.  If you are a punk fan, you should definatley pick this one up.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Well like i said i liked this movie a whole lot, maybe thats because i'm younger. anyhow i loved it, so should anyone else that is a \\"TRUE\\" resident evil fan. Even though  the movie is a little different from the games that doesnt effect how great it was! Well dont take it from me you...see it! I gave this movie 5 stars for a reason. Enjoy! I did!
B000063UR2|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid, but when I tried to watch it as an adult, their was one nagging aspect I couldn't get into: that god-awful Tangerine Dream soundtrack. I know, there are some of you out there that liked the old score, but I didn't. I thought it was out of place and dated the movie more than it deserved to be. Fortunately, Ridley Scott thought the same thing. <br />Legend, the Ultimate Edition, includes a re-scored, re-edited directors cut with commentary track of the movie, and for those old purists who can listen to the TD score without burning their own eyes out, the set includes the original theater edition. All this for a lot less than your average new release.<br />The story is simple enough. Your average Grimm Fairie Tale: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy fights cool looking demon to save girl. There's probably a lot more Jungian subtext going on beneath the surface than your average viewer is willing to explore, but when a movie looks this good, there isn't much need to go too far beneath the surface. I'm still amazed at how incredible this movie still looks after all these years. Tim Curry's Prince of Darkness is still one of the most incredible looking villains to date. The sets are flawless and vibrant and there's enough eye-candy to compete with any modern CG spectacle.<BR>The remastered sound including the original, classical score is very impressive. Instead of my ears bleeding from banal, synthesized 80's cheese, they were treated to a kind DTS experience. Darkness' voice is the booming, elemental force that it should be.<br />Unfortunately, most people still won't like this movie. It's always been a bit of a cult classic, and I think it will need more than a restored score to appeal to a broader audience. Most people will never be able to get past the faerie tale surreality that makes this movie interesting for those of us who can. If you've never seen the movie before, or watched it in the past and thought it was dated, I encourage youto try the Director's cut. Unlike Scott's cut of Blade Runner, this is a temendous improvement over the original.
0553573403|5.0|I liked this book. It was a good book. Everything about it was good...
0790729652|4.0|This is an excellent film. I keep reading that the first two Batman movies(Batman and Batman Returns)were dark and evil...my god this is BATMAN the superhero that lives in a cave not the Carebears that live among the rainbows and clouds etc. Real Batman fans see and appreciate what I'm trying to say here. All in all, I highly recommend this to your VHS/DVD collection, it is truly a work of art. Michael Keaton gives an outstanding portrayal of the dark knight, Tim Burton did a great job. Now for the rest of the films after the first two...well they just blow...Joel Schumacher really [messed] them up...real bad. I hope you enjoy this film..I did
B00005JKCF|5.0|This film delivered!!!!!!! It was not overly done and left us wanting more web slinging. I can't wait til the next one. If they keep this quality up I can see 4 movies made before Tobey  retires the title. Hopefully they will keep Joel Schumacker away from it as we saw what he did to the terrific BATMAN franchise. Way to go Spidey!!!!!
B00005JKED|3.0|The group of friends with whom I saw this film all rated this film much lower than I did. I am giving this movie three stars for one and only one reason: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are spectacular. Unfortunately, that is about the only positive thing I can say about this move. If not for their work, I would probably be giving this one star. Denzel Washington turns in one of his best performances ever, but unfortunately the character he plays is a dreadfully unattractive one. He is an amoralistic, out-of-control thug. Hawke holds his own with Denzel, and manages a more likable character. But watching this film was an intensely unpleasant experience. My friends and I watched it merely to see why Denzel won his Best Actor Oscar. We agreed he deserved it, but even near the very beginning we kept asking, \\"Is this thing going to get any better?\\"<br />The day after I saw this film, I tried watching bits of two other Denzel Washington films I had previously seen and enjoyed. One was THE PELICAN BRIEF and the other COURAGE UNDER FIRE. I was quite surprised to find that I was responding very negatively to seeing Denzel on screen. I realized that this was testimony to his incredibly convincing job as a total slime ball in TRAINING DAY. I plan soon on doing a Denzel film festival, watching two or three of his best films, just so I can get back to liking the guy again.<br />So I don't know whether to recommend this to others or not. I guess I'll say, it is worth seeing for two great performances, but don't expect to have a good time.  In talking to others about this film, most people seem to have a similar response:  Denzel and Ethan are great, but the film as a whole is just too depressing.
B00006690G|5.0|Wow! This album is by far tha best shady album. He really shows off his flow on songs like, \\"Soldier\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"White America\\", and pretty much all the other tracks. He even shows his singing talents on tracks like, \\"Hallie's song\\". Em's and Dre's disputes with Jumaine Dupri are talked about on \\"Say what you say\\" featuring DR.Dre. Obie Trice makes a guest appearence as well on \\"Drips\\" I think he is gonna be one of the best if not the best new mc's when his album comes out. D-12 makes an appearence too on \\"When the Music Stops\\". The BEST songs on here are \\"Superman\\" and \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" Where Em describes why he raps about his mom. Ken Kaniff makes an appearence on the outro too.                        <br />                      HOLLA!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|&quot;Love and Theft&quot; has simply some of the greatest music ever recorded.  The fact that it was done by the greatest artist in history is no suprise.  Bob Dylan is at his peak and every thing he does is pure gold.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's difficult to write a review for Tool's latest album, Lateralus.  It is the kind of art that is so complex, so beautiful, that it can only be discribed by single words and phrases.  Here's a few:<BR>Hypnotic<BR>Trance-Inducing<BR>Surreal<BR>Unfathomable<br />In short, this is quite simply one of the greatest musical achievements of our time.  As I have described it to others, it is \\"Subtle Hard Rock,\\" which seems to be an oxymoron... until you listen to the album.  It is True Rock, with the beautiful, hypnotic qualities of Trance.<br />Nothing can fully describe Lateralis.  You need to buy the CD, put it in a CD player, put headphones on, and close your eyes.  Nothing can prepare you for the nirvana that is Lateralis.
B00003CX5P|1.0|These new star wars movies are an embarasement to Lucas.  Nothing but lipservice to the first trilogy.  A disgrace with no merit of their own.
B00006690F|5.0|This cd is off the hook. The best song is TILL i Collapse feat nate dogg. This is a must buy cd. The dvd is also good. It has sum concert stuff.
B00005JKJA|4.0|This is my first Lynch film. I'm used to most &quot;odd&quot; films as my dad had raised me on them in the early '80s. As I finished this film, I sat back in confused aghast. On the one hand there's some top-notch acting, fresh faces in Laura Elena Harring and Naomi Watts, a beautifully stirring Spanish-language rendition of Patsy Cline''s &quot;Crying&quot;, and a peculiar little man in a ten gallon hat who calls himself the Cowboy. Very non-threatening, really. Well, on the other hand is the entire second half of the film. I would've lambasted this horrible confusion like a Spanish inquisitor had not I read the review of the viewer from Fort Worth. Ah, now I get it. If it was Dave's intention to confuse, and not to make a lick of sense, he did a sensational job. But if it was, in fact, his intention for people to observe this and think it an obvious mess while goading inquisitive minds to dissect this misunderstood monster to reveal to themselves the bare essentials to the story, then he is a master.
B00006690F|5.0|if there were more stars, i would give more out. this album blew me away. if you eminem's first two albums were good, wait till you hear this one. those look weak in comparison to this album. rolling stone hit the nail on the head with this one. this album is the best rap-rock album in history. hands down the best of the year. and so far there has been a lot of great albums. 2002 is the return of music. with black rebel motorcycle club, the strokes, doves, oasis, eminem, so on and so on, the coporate [junk] that we have been hearing will start to get erased. it starts with this phenominal album. do yourself a favor and pick this bad boy up.
0767836286|1.0|This is one of the worst movie I ever watched. I rented the disc, and feel lucky that I never buy this movie.<BR>Jeff Bridges is so-so, Tim Robbins looks more like a serial rapist rather than terrorist. Joan Cussack in suspense movies? You've gotta be joking!<BR>One star is one too many. Trust me. Do NOT buy this movie. Save your money and time.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I never was into the comics and spiderman with all those characters so I really didn't want to see it, but everyone said it was good and it was getting amazing reviews, I had nothing to lose except $[money], I came out of the theatre in disbelief and instantly I was attached, I wanted to know more about a sequal. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen, it is not all action with no storyline, I was suprised that there was even a storyline and it was a very good one, having Kirsten Dunst in the movie also was a big plus, can't wait until it comes out on DVD and the sequal!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is another one of those movies that I never saw in the theatre for whatever reason, and now that I've seen the DVD, I wish I had.  \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is straight-up eye candy.  It's an exquisite edifice built up around a \\"story\\" so totally inane and shallow that even the characters in the story remark on the fact in between cartwheels and costume changes.  But that's ok.  As it exists, it's really nothing more than a paean to 20th century pop culture - but a damned spectacular paean.  It's literally eye-popping.  Anybody who wants to complain that it doesn't accurately depict \\"Paris 1900\\" is willfully missing the point.  If the anachronism of \\"Like a Virgin\\" 85 years before its time is just too much for you to process, I suggest you go rent \\"You've Got Mail\\" or whatever and relive the late 90's exactly as they really were for practically everybody, and leave me alone.  \\"Moulin Rouge\\" relies on a gimmick, or, to be nice, a \\"convention;\\" namely, that of expressing the emotions of the characters and the development of the plot through pop songs, so that what you really have is a musical with immediately familiar lyrics and emotional associations built in.  It's tantamount to hip-hop's often unlikely sampling of pop music for its own creative ends.  Some say it's cheap and easy and reflects the superficiality and indolence of our consumer culture; others say it's the next evolutionary step in creativity.  I say it's just another form, but a potentially brilliant one.  It's collage.  And in \\"Moulin Rouge\\" it's beautifully done, although definitely an instance of style over substance.  The plot might make you gag, but your eyes won't get bored.  Nicole Kidman is always nice to look at, and she gets the hard-core glam treatment here in her Barbie-the-circus-performer getups.  Ewan MacGregor is all toothy cuteness and naive charisma like always.  They can both really sing too; MacGregor in particular sounds like he should've released an album in the 80's.  John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Latrec is amusing in an irritating sort of way with his tweety-bird speech impediment and artificially diminished stature.  I don't know who that is playing the Count but he is the smarmiest, most rat-looking...I have ever seen.  Good casting.  If you want to be visually blown away by a film, see \\"Moulin Rouge.\\"  The DVD(s) are packed with better extras than most.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Yah, I've only played the game oh...once? But I'm tired of people saying how bad the movie was.<BR>There have only been a few horror movies that gave me the absolute nightmare thrill that I enjoy, that being Residant Evil and the mini series of Stephen King's 'The Shining'. Only these two have given me nightmares after watching them, and that propels me to see them, again, and again. Now why people are giving such bad reveiws of the movie I don't know, it is impossible to adapt a move completly! With Harry Potter and LOtR being an exception, and those movies went to three hours, there's a difference there people!<BR>RE was an exceptionally good adaption throwing in the game and a few movie touches, you have to keep it slightly different to be believable!
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|I was sceptical about this one. I've heard it was musical, musical,and thats all. I was very wrong. True, Bjork's latest, the soundtrack to Dancer In The Dark, is a musical; but you have to remember its still Bjork. On &quot;Cvalda&quot;,the industrial sounds of a factory are pulled off in only a way Bjork can. Combining skittery, experimental pieces with sweeping classic musical, this doesn't feel too unfamiliar. The woman has been reinventing her styles for years. It feels like a comfortable shoe (or a swan dress!!) Some may be turned off by SelmaSongs, but if youre a real Bjork head, you'll find some of her signature music sprinkled here and there. The big standout here, of course, is &quot;I've Seen It All&quot; with Tom Yorke. The emotion is here, the goofiness is here, and of the seven songs, &quot;107 Steps&quot; is probably my least favorite. I don't like listening to someone count. Isnt that what Sesame Street is for? Anyhow, SelmaSongs is worth a spin. Casual fans:start with Debut and follow the catalog in order. You'll know why.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It is ridiculous for anybody to say this is not a great album. Even with the hype John Mayer is one you can count on that is going to be around for a long time. And, if you have not seen his live show, get out of that chair and go, you will not be disapponited. The cd is amazing, he is amazing. Do not listen to anyone that says otherwise. Go and buy this if you have not already NOW!!
B000005QKJ|5.0|I originally saw this movie upon it's release. It sticks in my memory not only because I don't often go to see a film in a movie theatre, aside from \\"art houses\\", but because it was one of the also few times I can recall ever experiencing a collective audience reaction, of shared awe, to a film. It remains one of the scariest, intelligent, hold-onto-your-seat horror/sci-fi films of all time. There had not been, and there has not been since, a creature to instill such terror onto an audience, as the one in this movie. To this day, as then, you can only say \\"How'd they do that??!!\\" But, for a movie to be truly terrifying, to the point that the audience is \\"involved\\", well..special effects alone can't do it. The players have to convey a total believability to an unbelievable situation. In this film, they succeed completely in scaring the living [daylights] out of you. Sigourney Weaver is incredible as Ripley, in this sequel which is far superior to any in the series. Her \\"Rambo\\" like, but still feminine turn in this role was as unique then, as now, for female roles, and is totally convincing. The supporting cast are all equally believable, Paul Reiser especially so as the definitive corporate slime-ball. Aside from Weavers \\"Ripley\\", I found the character of Vasquez, the super-butch she-commando who out-testosterones the men and monsters, to be one of the most memorable characters in this film, or any of it's kind, and her performance gives Weaver a run for her money. This film is just a non-stop, roller coaster ride of un-relenting terror. The unique, eerie music scored for this film only increases the sense of foreboding which never let's up. There are many memorable scenes, the climactic to- the- death battle between Ripley and the \\"Queen\\" alien, as Ripley defends the life of the orphaned little girl, being one of the most memorable, and, for my vote, the most awe-inspiring in motion picture history. This is a film that will impress even non- sci-fi/horror fans, with its' intelligence, story, and, oft-imitated but never even closely duplicated effects. All together, they make one of the most memorable movie experiences, that transcends its' \\"genre\\", and is ,simply , one of the best movies of the last 20 years. You knew then it was an immediate classic, and it has remained so. Feel like scaring the life out of yourself? Turn off the lights, pop in this film, and, as the then unknown Bill Paxtons character \\"Hudson\\" says, \\"We're on an express elevator to Hell !!\\"its' intelligence, story, and, oft-imitated but never even closely duplicated effects.

0345451325|5.0|This book was the best book I have read in my entire life. The game(halo on xbox) is also the best game on a game system I have ever played. The book was so clear and intense that I read it twice.Even if you did not play halo on xbox yet, read the book, I garentee you, you will read it twice.
B000063CPL|5.0|..but I'm not going to sit around and nitpickingly compare it to Live After Death. this album is great, and the sound quality is also great. The song selection could be a bit different from the REST of the BNW Tour, though, i think, since this was a MASSIVE rock festival. I  think it should've had songs like PowerSlave and some earlier stuff on there they dont do live anymore, like Caught Somewhere In Time, or Rime Of the Ancient Mariner. But all in all, this is really good. I'd reccomend it. Also--The \\"A Day in The Life of\\" video is great--i got a kick out if it.
B000063DFN|5.0|This to me, is Iron Maiden's BEST album ever, hands down. Better than Number, better than Piece, better than Somewhere in Time. Firstly, it's got a bunch of great songs. i like them all, but i wore myself out on Flash Of the Blade, before i even got the CD, cause of the mp3 (Not saying you can wear out easily,i just listened to it too damn much!) The only track that's not truely 'great' is Flash of the Blade. But it's still good. My all time favorite maiden track is on here as well, no not Ancient Mariner, but the title track its self -- Power Slave. This song has everything. I COULD reccomend the CD just for the title track, but that'd be not fair to Aces High, 2 Minutes To Midnight, Losfer Words and Ancient Mariner.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana shaped an entire generation of music. They helped rock become more &quot;out there&quot; than it was. Even though Kurt Cobain hated this cd, because a lot of people just liked it cause it was popular, this is a masterpiece. The opening track &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; fills your room with energy and amazing guitar rythms. Every single song on this cd is Spectacular and i havent once skipped one song to get to another. Even the secret song &quot;Endless Nameless&quot; is good.
B000003TAB|4.0|This cd is a great cd,The Opening 3 songs &quot;Dive&quot; &quot;Sliver&quot; and &quot;Stain&quot; are great songs, but songs like New Wave polly do not sound as good. <br />Best Song: Aneurysm
B000003TAR|5.0|This cd is simply a masterpiece, Following the release of Nevermind and Incesticide, Kurt Cobain was fed up with the fans who just liked Nirvana for Nevermind and because it was popular. This cd is quite different from others, The first track &quot;Serve The Servents&quot; contains lyrics such as &quot;Teenage Angst has paid off well; Now im bored again&quot; as a payback to those hollow fans. The lone, in my opinion, let down on this cd is Radio Friendly Unit Shifter. <br />The best songs on this cd are: Serve The Servents, Dumb, Milk It
B000059TPN|5.0|THE ROCK is one of the best movies ever made. Starring Sean Connery (who makes this movie funny and great) and of course nichlas cage(who is another supurb actor) this movie will keep you from breathin util the ending. not only does the moive kick sooo much ..., but the special collecter adition of this dvd makes it vastly better. plus, at a price you can't beat. im not high, im not a guy who works at amazon, im a rock lover and you will be too. JUST BUY THE ... MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I also loved the books and the movie but just like someone else said, the film is the real highlight of the DVD. All the special features are aimed to kids except an interview of 15 minutes with Chris Columbus and others. I'm writing this review to give a fast way to find the deleted scenes but you must have the SEARCH function on your DVD player. Go to track 80(80/84) of the second DVD with the SEARCH function. Then, select the 5 th bottle and the stone. That way, you can see the deleted scenes without playing the whole game each time. There is only 6 minutes of deleted scenes on the DVD. Not 10 minutes like I read on the HP website. The deleted scenes are interesting but hardly essential and you can find them as well on the video.
B00006690F|5.0|The cd is amazing. Almost no bad songs except for Square Dance. I think it can be the best cd of 2002. Great record. Best song is My dads gone crazy (#19). Overall very satisfying.
B00006690F|5.0|I was some of the fortunate one's to get an advance copy.  I spent the next few days listening to this album.  Once again Eminem has done it again.  He gets you ready with \\"White America\\" where he talks about Tipper Gore, President Bush and wife Laura, Congess, and Dick Cheany's wife.  And he keeps you on the edge of your seat until \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" in which he has his daughter (Hailie Jade) on the track.  Tracks like \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" (in which he talks about his mother, his wife, and his father), \\"Sing For The Moment\\" (A sample of Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\"), \\"Without Me\\" (which he spits the venom on  Chris Kirkpatrick of 'NSync, Moby, and Limp Bizkit), and \\"Hailie's Song\\" (in which he actually sings) have you wondering what's next.  With guest spots by D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Hailie Jade, and Obie Trice.  This is an album that parents will hate and the children will want.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Way back in February 2002, my wife, our son, and I made an unusual evening foray to the town nearest our home having a theater in it.  The theater was one of those multiplexes (yes, Maine does have `em!!) with 14 theaters in the same building.  After driving the 32 miles to the theater complex, we found ourselves faced with a veritable treasure trove of excellent choices... among them \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" \\"John Q,\\"  \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  We opted for \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" mainly because it looked like the movie that would be the most interesting to all three of us, and because we've always enjoyed movies directed by Ron Howard.<br /><br />\\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" winner of the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar at the most recent Academy Awards, is perhaps one of the finest movies we've seen in quite some time!  Starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer, this movie held all of us spellbound for its entire two-plus hour running time.  \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" features a superb cast, an outstanding story line (based on actual persons and events) and a wonderful script.<br /><br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" tells the story of John Forbes Nash, a brilliant mathematician whose  pioneering work on game theory ultimately won for him the Nobel Prize in Economics, but whose \\"beautiful mind...\\" brilliant as it was... was tortured by the most debilitating form mental illness imaginable: paranoid schizophrenia.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is superb!  Russell Crowe is magnificent as the tortured genius John Nash.  From quiet, nervous, socially inept scholar, to intense code-breaker, to delusional mental patient, Crowe keeps viewers constantly on the edge of their seats with his completely believable interpretation of the mind of  a schizophrenic.  It is, in my view, Crowe's best performance ever... and there have been a lot of good ones!<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is excellent as Alicia Nash.  Appearing next to Crowe must have been rather daunting for her.  She not only held her own next to the man who is rapidly becoming one of  Hollywood's truly great actors; she illuminated her scenes with her own considerable talent.  In Connelly's capable hands, her character shows tenderness, compassion, and a strength of character that must have been the hallmark of the real person she so capably portrays.<br /><br />Ed Harris brings his usual superlative skills as a character actor to the role of the shadowy William Parcher, the man who recruits Nash into the world of Cold War code-breaking.<br /><br />After the acting, the most impressive feature of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is the technique director Ron Howard uses to portray the phantasmic state of John Nash's mind.  I don't want to offer too many details here, for to do so would be to provide a major \\"spoiler\\" for those who haven't seen the movie yet.  Suffice it to say, the technique is surprising and very effective.  Viewers may occasionally feel themselves a bit unsure of where the story is going (as I did), but rest assured... everything is made clear by the end of the film.<br /><br />Before we watched \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" I had seen a television interview with director Ron Howard in which he talked about the making of the film.  In this interview, Howard stated that he had decided, as much as possible, to shoot in chronological order... in other words, the earliest scenes were shot first, the latest scenes last.  According to Howard, this is a technique hardly ever used by directors; he attributes much of the movie's best qualities to shooting in sequential order.<br /><br />I tend to agree with Howard's assessment of his own work.  The movie has a decidedly ensemble-like feel to it despite a relatively large cast.  Everyone is so good in their part, and every scene flows so seamlessly into the one that follows that it seemed to us, throughout the film's two-plus hour running time, like we were witnesses to an actual unfolding drama.  Iseriously doubt that \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" would have been as intensely dramatic or as effective a vehicle for such a highly complex, intelligently told story.<br /><br />If you haven't guessed by now, my wife, our son, and I are unanimous in our verdict on \\"A Beautiful Mind:\\" this film is a \\"must see.\\".  If you've seen it already, watch it again!!seriously doubt that \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" would have been as intensely dramatic or as effective a vehicle for such a highly complex, intelligently told story.<br /><br />If you haven't guessed by now, my wife, our son, and I are unanimous in our verdict on \\"A Beautiful Mind:\\" this film is a \\"must see.\\".  If you've seen it already, watch it again!!
B00006690F|4.0|The damage:<BR>Square Dance has a beat out of this world very original<BR>Cleaning out my closet is nice and reminescent<BR>SuperMan has a nice slow beat and chorus- I rewinded this several times <BR>Say what you say is tight and good lyrics<BR>My Dad's gone crazy is original, nice beat- is this his son in the chorus?<BR>Hailies song has him singing and is hittin<BR>all other songs are ok. don't care too much for 'drips'(too filty)
B000063UR2|5.0|I have been waiting to see THIS version of this film for 16 years! The original US release was a travesty. With the Goldsmith score removed and plot development excised, one was left with a beautiful failure. This &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version enables the viewer to relax into the story and see real characters develop and explore their history. This movie was made long vefore Tom Cruise developed his smile or scowl style of acting (?) and this longer edit shows that the guy used to be able to be natural on-screen. I now have this movie on two laser discs (US full screen and Japanese edit full screen) and it's been quite a long wait - but worth it. This is a definite must!
B000007R13|4.0|fantastic music, but why is so much of it coming from behind me?  I hate to fall into the trap of reviewing the mix rather than the music, but i assume we all give this music 99 stars. I'm getting used to the mix, but I still wonder why Dickey, and Duane are playing from behind my couch, instead of to the left and right of my tv.
B00006690F|5.0|...This album is unlike his other two major releases, The beats are new and groundbreaking and his lyrical deliverly is very well devolped. He is flowing better than ever, and his lyrics are amazing.He's taking the \\"been there,done that\\" stance on this record, which is great. My favorite tracks on the album are \\"I'm a Soldier\\",\\"What you Say w/ Dr.Dre\\" (produced by Timbaland),\\"I'm sorry Mama\\",The singing song, etc..This isn't just a good album, it's a ... classic. Buy it now!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|In the summer of 1988, at the age of 14, I bought this album on LP. At the time Guns N Roses was the hottest band of America and in the same summer you always heard \\"Sweet child o mine\\" on the radio here in Sweden. I liked \\"Sweet child o mine\\" really much when it appeard on the radio and that is why I bought this album. And from the moment I first heard it till now, I have been a big fan of Guns N Roses, I tell ya! <br />The entire album is a masterpiece! All the 12 songs is just heavy rock n roll and nothing else. The music on it is just straight, and I like that kind of records. \\"Appetite for destruction\\" was and is a hard rock classic! Later the band also released \\"G N R Lies\\" and \\"Use your illusion I\\" and \\"II\\", also masterpieces, but in my opinion \\"Appetite for destruction\\" is the one!<br />Buy it! It rocks and so does the price of it here on Amazon.com!<br />A hard rock fan.
015626224X|5.0|Like most of us, I read Orwell in high school (\\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\") and remained largely unaware that hed written anything that didnt involve either talking Trotskyite animals or a terrifyingly functional dystopia.  A friend of mine gave me Down and Out in Paris and London a month ago, and I was unable to put it down until I was done.  In what is basically the chronicle of a couple of months of self-induced misery, Orwell explodes a lot of myths surrounding poverty and the spirit-breaking labor that is, for many, the only exit from it.<br />We know the gist of the book: Orwell sets up shop amongst the common people, first washing dishes in various Paris restaurants and then tramping around London and environs.  Proceeding via introductions and anecdotes--some hilariously funny, others downright heart-rending--Down and Out in Paris and London offers a detailed tour of a side of life that most of us will only ever read about.  From the painstaking descriptions of exactly what kind of muck is to be found on the floor of a restaurants kitchen in 1920s and 1930s Paris (you dont want to know, but he tells you) to elaborations on how to skirt begging laws in London and the dangers associated with such living, Orwell makes his points, one after the other.  To his credit, though, there is little dogmatic moralizing; when, at the end of the book, he tells you what hes learned, he doesnt seem to feel the need to shove down the readers throat what is clearly stuck in his own.  The feeling is strong, though, that youd have to be blind, crazy or both, not to reach the same conclusions.<br />The greatest strength of Down and Out, though, is the manner in which Orwell never attempts to pass himself off as one of the people he is pretending to be.  The English band Pulp has a song about rich kids slumming with the common people, but the song points out that, if the going ever really got tough, the rich kids can always call Daddy and have him bail them out.  Orwell has to realize that he is in that same privileged situation; his tramping in London, for example, is simply to kill time until he can take up a legitimate position, and, along the way, he is able to borrow money several times from a friend in order to make ends meet.  This distance that he subtly maintains between himself and those who have little choice in their fate only adds punch to the lessons he learns, and Orwells probably privileged reader (at least privileged enough to spend money on books) is permitted to learn alongside him.<br />There are picky complaints that could be lodged here--the untranslated French passages, for example, which will leave at a loss those without high school French--but, overall, Down and Out in Paris and London is a great read, one of those few books that manages to be both entertaining and properly disturbing.  It has all the wit and scoop of later efforts like Bourdains recent best-seller, Kitchen Confidential, or Ehrenreichs Nickel and Dimed, but Down and Out, after bigger game than Bourdain and less unforgivably preachy than Ehrenreich, manages to dig deeper under your skin and stay there longer.  And that, as Orwell concludes, is a beginning.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem, once again, amazes in his new album, The Eminem Show. In this album, Eminem truely shows that he has \\"matured\\" and has become an even better rapper. The songs on the ambum are very catchy with good meanings behind them in the lyrics. In the song titled \\"Hailie's Song\\", we see a new side of Eminem. It shows the love he has for his daughters and shows how peoples bad remarks affect him. The best songs in the album are: Without Me, Hailie's Song, White America, When The Music Stops, Cleanin Out My Closet, Superman, and Sing For The Moment. This CD also features the interesting and funny skits, including the infamous Steve Berman. Overall, a really good CD.
0140149295|5.0|I feel anyone who reads this book will be as unbelieveably moved as I was.  I have one wish, just to have a chance to speak with Rubin.  Enjoy the book, and God Bless.
0684800713|2.0|The Sun Also Rises is an okay book. At some points it was very interesting and at other times somewhat boring. The book also had its points where it was a little difficult to understand. If I had the choice to read the book again I doubt I would unless I was forced to. Even though the book wasn't terrible its not something that I would just pick up and read in my spare time.<BR>The book had its good points. The book had a lot to do with stuff that is going on today. That is one reason that I continued reading the book. If it wasn't for the many problems in the book I doubt I would have finished it. I also think it had I little too much going on because it reminded me of a soap opera.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna never invented electronica, but you can always rely on her keen instincts and good tastes to successfully bring something underground into the mainstream.  First with Prodigy back in 1997, then with this album in 1998.  As mainstream as she is, much of her tastes for 20 years have always been in the underground and she has enough clout to sell it and make it her own.  This risky move turned out to be one of her most critically acclaimed and commercial albums of her career.<br />Collaborating with British producer William Orbit and Patrick Leonard for co-songwriting, Madonna creates her moodiest and most haunting album since &quot;Erotica&quot;.  Often the trip taken down this album is very melancholy but spiritual, sometimes to the point of self-indulgence and pretentiousness (but that's why we love her).  The songs &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot; are the only times when she becomes as carefree as she did in her song structure like she was back in the 80s.  Nonetheless it's an excellent dance-pop album that is deep-rooted in ambient electronica and rock.<br />Her songwriting and singing continues to improve with age, as you listen to the opening track &quot;Drowned World&quot;, where she realizes her fame isn't as important to her anymore.  &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; is Madonna on an acid trip while freestyling her lyrics.  Her voice sounds incredibly sweet and vulnerable when she sings the melody to the haunting love ballad, &quot;Frozen&quot;, brilliantly accompanied with strings and synth beats.  She even dares to recite an Indian Sanskrit chant on her record (&quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot;) and incorporate techno elements that would impress Talvin Singh (and it sounds pretty good).  After a smalzty, but sweet ballad dedicated to her daughter in &quot;Little Star&quot;, the album ends with one of her most spookiest songs about her dead mother in &quot;Mer-Girl&quot;.  <br />This is the album that made me rediscover Madonna and truly appreciate her artistry.  I loved the album enough to check out her back catalogue, only to discover that it didn't take ROL to discover that she's a great artist.  She's a music critic's darling now but if you put aside her past publicity stunts, she's been thinking on a higher plane since &quot;Live To Tell&quot; back in '86.  It's only now that she's getting her long overdue praise from her critics.  On that note I also recommend &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.
B00006690F|3.0|I bought this cd hoping it would add something to Emimen's previous recordings. While the tracks offer a new sound and a different lyrical flow the overall pace is boring and few of the songs are memorable.  Marshall rips those who are suing him and takes the usual and predicitable shots at the FCC and other branches of government.  It is by far not his best album, but is still better then most of [junk] thats out there (it has been a pathetic couple of years for the hip hop genre).  Its a must have for Emimen fans but if you are new to his stuff I'd pick up his first two CDs
B000005AYM|5.0|I remember back in 97' when &quot;On and On&quot; and &quot;Tyrone&quot; were burning up the charts, and I got this album immediately.  5 years later and I still give &quot;Baduizm&quot; many spins.  Erykah Badu and D'Angelo started the revival of the soul movement, that continues to florish today.  &quot;Baduizm&quot; goes on my list as one of my all-time favorites.<br />The woman is a gifted singer with an incredibly distinctive voice.  Few artists can successfully &quot;act out a song when singing live on stage.  And even fewer, like Erykah, can act out a song while in the confines of a studio.  She's Ella, Etta, and Billie Holliday reborn.  <br />As a songwriter she loves to show off her playful and funny side in many of her songs.  Just listen to her Afro (Freestyle Skit) and the jazzy &quot;Certainly&quot;, the song about a suitor trying to slip his love interest &quot;a mickey&quot;.  She never leaves her spiritual beliefs behind when she gets all beatnik in songs like &quot;On and On&quot; and &quot;Rimshot&quot;, and the romantic quasi-reincarnation ballad &quot;Next Lifetime&quot;.<br />And for all you hippie and yuppie types who love hanging out at your favorite upscale coffee house (admit it, you do), I suggest this is the kind of mood music you should relax to next time you go.  For me, my relaxation track is &quot;Certainly&quot;....perhaps one of the most brilliant songs I've ever heard, it's an incredibly hypnotic song.<br />The only downside of this album is that is doesn't contain the hilarious single &quot;Tyrone&quot;.  But you can get it on her &quot;Erykah Badu Live&quot; album which was released shortly after, and it's worth the penny when you hear the woman sing live and interact with her audience.
B000022TSH|5.0|If you want to see Jack at his best get this DVD.  Even if you are not a fan of the detective genre it is still a great film.  If you are detective fan you won't find a better movie even if it had been written and directed by Raymond Chandler himself.
0060934913|4.0|Don't waste another moment reading this review, just go buy this book! <br />From the first page to the last I was fascinated by every element of this story. It had a behind the scenes kind of naked truth that reminded me of \\"I'm with the Band\\".  And Anthony Bourdain could have just as easily pulled of the role of rock star as he can of chef.  His story has all the right elements:<BR>-Young boy discovers his passion (food)<BR>-Stumbles through his early career<BR>-Gets messed up on drugs<BR>-Ends up in a successful restaurant <BR>-Writes a tell-all book and gets his mug all over the tube<br />Not only do the elements line up, the attitude lines up.  Bourdain is witty, sarcastic and about as cuddly as a cactus, but it works for him, and the man can tell a story. I'll go on any journey he wants to take me on(culinary or otherwise). <br />If Anthny Bourdain has groupies, tell me where to sign up!
B00006690F|5.0|This album is great, Eminem has this thing that every album of his is better than the last and everyone he comes out with is good, the best track is Till I Collapse w/ Nate Dogg, another good one is Sing For The Moment, the skits are funny too, and there is a little rock for those who like Aerosmith and Queen, this album is still full of contoversy and cursing, but he seems more optimsic. This album is a must for all Eminem fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Welcome to David Lynch's universe where one has to be suspicious of even the most ordinary things.  'Mulholland Drive' is basically two stories; one involving a frustrated filmmaker and the other involving two women living in the same house.  One of the women was involved in a car accident, but can't remember her name nor where she came from.  The other woman just came to Hollywood searching for stardom.  The filmmaker is frustrated because the big shots of the studio want another woman for the role.  Alongside with that are smaller stories that will make some sense later on... I hope.<br />The story is told very unconvetionally and the second half of the film is a flasback.  Be warned though, the flashback is even more confusing than the first half.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie actually revolves around a very twisted murder plot.  The two murderers are the two least likely people one could imagine on this Earth.  I think I'm giving too much away now.  That is my best explaination of it.  Parts of it are boorish and parts of it are so bizzare, it is hard not to pay attention.  Once again though, I think Lynch is carefully ripping off Alfred Hitchcock.  Since Alfred has been imitated constantly, Lynch is careful not to be too much like him.  Only die-hard film buffs will notice the similarities in his stories and Hitchcock's.  Sorry David, you aren't that original.  ...
B00006690F|5.0|this is by far the best cd of eminem as far as talent goes. so far i have listened to the cd around 5 or 6 times in a row and i havent been annoyed by any of the songs. i'm listening to it right now. its a really down to earth CD. Em talks about all sorts of subject including Kim and Debbie (his mother). there is nothing more to say other than this is my favorite CD i've ever purchased and it will continue to be my fav for quite a while. BUY IT!
6300216543|4.0|Al Pacino is a short man, but one won't recognize that because he gives such awesome performances.  In 'Serpico' Al shows us he just doesn't do gangster roles.  Based on a true story, 'Serpico' is about an honest cop who is caught in a dishonest police department.  The beginning sequences are dreamy and happy, but soon it becomes much darker.  Soon Serpico realizes being honest is more dangerous then being corrupt.  The entire department is against him and there are physical attacks on him.  It goes to the point where he loses his girlfriend.  That was good though because the girlfriend was a bad actress.  That was one of two main flaws of the movie.  Some of the acting was bad and the screenplay was weak.  Oh well, one can't expect brilliancy at every turn.<br />The other star of the film is the director, Sidney Lumet, who is one of the most underrated directors I know of.  Lumet films are always set in New York and always involve tough characters.  Although he uses limited ideas and settings, his films are always good.  They never become tiresome and one knows they have spent their time well watching them.  'Serpico' is no exception.

6304510861|3.0|David Lynch's 'Lost Highway', overall, doesn't make any sense but still isn't bad.  Be warned, this film does not have your standard kind of plot.  It is about an musician, Bill Pullman, who is suspicious of her wife's behavior.  He thinks she is sleeping with someone else.  Both seem psychologically depressed because they talk very softly and rarely smile.  Some strange incidents occurr and next thing you know, Bill Pullman is in jail for killing his wife.  Another bizzare incident occurrs in jail and Bill is transformed in a younger man.  What that you say?  Yes, you read that correctly.  The warden realizes Bill Pullman doesn't exist anymore so he releases the younger car machanic.<br />But, the warden has two guys spy on him after he is released.  The young guy goes through a bizarre sexual journey involving his girlfriend and Bill Pullman's wife.  Wait a minute, I thought she was killed?  Well, she was and wasn't.  His wife in the second half of the film has blond hair, but in the first half she had brown hair.  So in some ways, she is still alive.. I think.  Is is just me, or is 'Lost Highway' subliminally ripping off 'Vertigo'?  Remember how Kim Novak had blond hair in the first half and brown in the second half.  Who do you think you're fooling David Lynch?<br />Even though it doesn't make much sense, 'Lost Highway' has some really steamy sex scenes.  The color and lighting is perfect, bringing and erotic feel.  Lynch used two sexy ladies with nice breasts for our viewing pleasure.  Some may think they are exploitative, but they were done so well, I enjoyed every second of it.  Bill Pullman's wife deserves two stars alone, if you catch my drift. :)
B0000009UX|5.0|See below for effusive praise. Suffice it to say that Elvis Costello is not my favorite artist by any means, yet this is unquestionably one of my three favorite albums of all-time, and easily my favorite album of the 1980s.
0792838084|2.0|David Lynch is a very unconventional storyteller and filmmaker. There is nothing wrong with that, but one must at least make sense of the story.  In 'Blue Velvet', Lynch explores the sexual underworld of a clean-cut suburban town. A young man finds some suspicious things happening in an apartment complex. What he finds out is quite distrubing; Dennis Hopper has a fetish for blue velvet and performes some bizzare sex acts. It was interesting, but the story is ruined by Hopper using the f-word for every other word. The young man falls in love with the victim of Hopper's sex acts. Other than that the story is not very interesting. The characters are more like robots and once again there are scenes that are obviously stolen from Alfred Hitchcock, specifically 'Vertigo'.

B000002JS6|5.0|Without a doubt, AC/DC's opus, \\"Back In Black\\", is the all-time best hard rock disk. It boasts a full montage of classic heavy-hitters, with each and every song on this album being a rocket ride straight to rock and roll hell, and in this case it's a trip you won't want to forget. \\"All Night Long\\", \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\", \\"Givin' The Dog A Bone\\", and the title track is pure let-it-all-hang-out metal madness from these legends of rock and roll.

The music blends well with the overall movie itself, is intense and powerful, and follows itself throughout, each song more incredible and inspiring then the last.<BR>If you haven't seen the movie you really must do so, and even if you haven't or don't intend to, this soundtrack really is a great one to add to your collection, I REALLY don't think ANYONE will be disappointed with it! ^_^
0064407667|2.0|I picked this book up to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out.  I was rather disappointed.  It seems the story line and development are crafted to fit childrens reading but the vocabulary and patience required to read this book to the end is tartgeted at adults.  I'm sure there could be a good balance but this author does not acheive it.  I was bored with this book.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan's album is awesome!  My favorite songs are &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; (track #1) with Mark Hoppus doing back-ups, and Addicted (track #7).  I recently saw these guys in concert and they are amazing.  I met Pierre as well.  Not only can they make a great punk rock album, but they put on a great punk rock show plus they are great guys and seem to really care about their fans.  This album is a must for any punker's (or anyone else's) CD collection!
B0000668IF|4.0|Okay, once and for all, this is not a re-hash of Moby's excellent album Play.  To say that simply because he samples gospel music on this album he is recreating the sound of Play is silly.  Working from that logic one should say that the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" is a poor recording because the bandmembers use guitars like they did for all past recordings.  The samples utilized by Moby on 18 or very different from those used on Play and should be seen as one of his multiplicity of instruments rather than musical cliches or laziness.<br />That rant aside, 18 stands as a subtle, beautiful album.  Rougher  and more ethereal than Play, closer at times to \\"Everything is Wrong,\\" 18 plays like a painful love letter to the world.  Politically conscious as usual, Moby infuses each of his songs with a somberness and a painful-to-the-touch sensitivity that is startlingly evocative.  Furthering this feeling is the much-appreciated presence of Moby singing on several of the tracks with his gorgeous, mournful voice.<br />The only downside to this album is the Jam for the Ladies with MC Lyte and Erykah Badu.  In and of itself it's a fun, funky, sure-fire dancehall hit but in the middle of 18 it feels awkward and out of place, startlingly upbeat in the mellow moonscape of other songs that comprise the album but that should not deter anyone from purchasing this album.<br />Intriguing and insightful it begs repeat listening from start to end (a beautiful feature of Moby's music is the unity of each album. . stopping in the middle leaves a sense that something is missing. . .the next song) 18 stands as a testiment to Moby's ability as a musician and poet as well as to the the idea that electronic music is far from dead.
B0000640SA|3.0|The extras aren't hard to find. They take some noodling but aren't very complicated to get at, if you pay attention. But still, they seem chintzy. The director's commentary is okay. I always like the &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; extras, but this one is just mediocre. The photos of props and posters is boring. The fabled backward version is not what you think it is; and it's not very interesting. For two discs, I wanted better stuff. For example, the IFC interview on the single-disc version, deleted scenes, perhaps an interview with the director's brother about how he thought his short story translated to the big screen, and maybe even a documentary on the very real illness suffered by Guy Pearce's character. No need to upgrade to this version if you've already got the single-disc. Love the movie, though.
B00003CXN3|4.0|This is a movie about the debatably successful war on drugs.  It is made up of four story lines, presented like movie serials, which Steven Soderbergh does a great job in weaving together by the end of the film.  As a result, the viewer sees how a police officer in Tijuana is linked to a young, female drug-user in suburban America.<br />This film questions the war by pointing out that it is never-ending and is pervasive.  The best line is where the drug czar, played my Michael Douglas, asks \\"How do we wage war against our families?\\"  The movie is not saying that the war is completely futile, but it says that we should rethink our strategy.<br />I would highly recommend seeing this film.
B00006690F|5.0|I couldnt wait for this CD to come out. His last one wasnt as good, but this CD is his best. if you like eminem, this is a perfect CD to get. it is another great CD from him, and never gets boring. it is just him, just like his first 2 CD's. it has 20 songs so you wont get bored of it quickly. they are all great songs, abviously. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes eminem, or liked his last CD's.
B00006690F|5.0|I bought his cd on sunday (when it came out) and its like the best by eminem. the best songs (in my opinion are) \\"cleaning out my closet\\", \\"superman\\" , \\"without me\\", \\"halie's song\\" and \\"my dad's gone crazy\\" . most of the Cd is about his Daughter (who sings on \\"my dad's gone crazy\\". This Cd shows off a more personal Em, plus it doesnt have as many insults as his previous CDs.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Many people especially critics have criticised this album and said it is overhyped but I disagree with this. It is a departure from Dire Straits earlier work in that it is more atmospheric and varied but this is not a disappointment at all, nearly every song is great except for Walk of Life (which I personally dislike). The most famous song of the album is Money For Nothing which is probably the heaviest song DS have done. The most beautiful song on the album and my personal favourite DS song ever is Brothers In Arms which has such emotional guitar playing from Mark Knopfler who is a master of his craft. This is an essential album for a music lovers collection.
B0000668IF|2.0|I was waiting for this new release for a long time. So much hype, so much exciting. But when I finally got it it was a big disappointment. I understand Moby has to make remixes, and I do understand that every DJ has his own style. But in this case you don't hear anything new or different from what you heard on his old albums. Just recycling of old tricks.<BR>Save your money, wait for the next album.
0385503954|1.0|If you suffer from insomnia, this is a great drug-free way to go into snooze mode. I just cannot fathom the great reviews, the lofty place on the best-seller lists, and the swooning praise of readers. Everyone in my book club just hated it, we all gave up at at various points in the book and chose something else to read. The lies and imaginings of a spoiled brat are described as some sort of grand \\"crime.\\" Give me a break. This was truly one of the worst books I have ever read.
1590710037|5.0|One thing is certain:  Steven Pressfield was compelled by whatever source provides him inspiration for his craft to write this book.  This is not a labor of love; it is a labor of compulsion.  The book is also certain to draw extreme reviews:  some will love it; others won't.  Middle ground is unlikely.  The book manifests itself:  I don't think Steven Pressfield cares if he sells one copy, nor does he care whether we like it or not.  He only knows that this was a book he had to write.  I'm glad he did.<br />The War of Art is a real-world extension of Bagger Vance, the Jonathan Livingston Seagull of the `90's.  Pressfield's presentation draws comparison to many statements that have floated around in my head over the years.  JLS said \\"You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self here and now.\\"  In the second edition of the Star War series (in the late `70's?) Yoda tells Luke Skywalker, \\"There is no try.\\"  Either do it or don't do it.  The War of Art makes a strong case for both of these concepts.<br />I was a fighter pilot for nearly 10 years, edited and published a newspaper for two, and entered the battlefield of corporate America two decades ago.  As I concluded Pressfield's book, I was overwhelmed with the bittersweet feeling that I truly wished I had read this book when I was 20, not 52.  Only having read one or two randomly selected pages when I got the book, I emailed by 20-year-old son in New Hampshire and made it \\"mandatory reading.\\"  He called me within 48 hours, and I couldn't fail to see the impression The War of Art had made on him.  \\"Dad,\\" he said, \\"For the first time in my life, I can see all the time I've wasted ....\\"  The impact was as real as it was profound.<br />I read once that \\"the only thing in the middle of the road is yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\"  Pressfield powerfully demands that the reader has to make affirmative choices to accomplish any calling in life; there is no middle of the road.  He deftly explains why so few people reach their own God-given and inspired potential and offers his path for reaching that potential.<br />Even at 52-years-old, I will change my life having read this book.  I sense my son will too.  There are concepts that I cannot nor would I fully commit to.  Nonetheless, Pressfield has professed an approach to life, be it art or otherwise, that will work.  Whether you love this book or hate it, I guarantee it will make you think, and it will alter your approach to life, the path you've taken and the pace of your journey.reach their own God-given and inspired potential and offers his path for reaching that potential.<br />Even at 52-years-old, I will change my life having read this book.

It is everything u would expect from the detroit rapper.guests on the album include, Nate Dogg, Dr.Dre, D12, and his daughter, Hailie Jade.it has 20 tracks on it, which makes it worth the money, another bonus is the dvd disc included.it has a preview of his new movie,\\"8 Mile\\", an episode from the Slim Shady Show DVD, his new dvd on his european tour and a few extra live songs at the Fuji Rock Festival 2001 and tramps nightclub in new york.Two words for ya', B     U     Y     I     T     !     !     !
038533558X|5.0|I absolutely, positively could NOT put this book down!!  I could not leave these characters dangling in midair while I concerned myself with sleep!!  From page 1 until the last page I was hooked--turning pages as fast as possible and growling at anyone who thought to interrupt me!<br />Coben has done it again with the characters--Will, Squares, Sheila, the Ghost--each with his/her own personality quirks and unique voice.  I love the fact that the father/son relationship is just as strong in this book as it is in his Bolitar series.  That draws me closer to the main character and I was most definitely drawn to Will.<br />The plot twists are extraordinary--one almost needs a map to keep up!!  But just almost.  Coben leads the reader through the maze of twists and turns like the master story teller he is.<br />Now to get some sleep......
B00004XQ83|5.0|I have to say, I am not a big bluegrass, country music fan, but I know good music when I hear it. This CD was pure, unadulturated talent, it was music that no matter where your background lies, would cause you stamp your feet and hum the melody. From its haunting tunes of \\"Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby\\" to its hip slappin, toe tappin tunes of \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" this soundtrack deserves 5 stars. It is rare to find a soundtrack, or for that matter any CD that can be played in its entirety and keep one entertained, and this soundtrack did just that. I would reccomend this to the Jay-Z fans, and the Charlotte Churchill fans also. <BR>~Kudos~
B00000IQW0|5.0|I loved it and I would like to see more DVD material on the Galactica.  It can have such a great comeback as another feature film.  Imagine what they can do with it nowadays.  Crazy idea of mine, but how about some real terminator like Cyclons?  These Cyclons wouldn't be the slow, dumbwitted ones we've seen in the past, but fast, sleek killing machines who are bad enough without laser guns and rifles.  The Salvation Army could have taken out the original Cyclons.  Hind-sight now, not scary or threating at all, Commander Cain was right, what the heck were they  running from?
B00006690G|4.0|It was quite obvious that he'd beat the iron while it was hot, and that is what he's doing, waiting a bare year between his last album and this one. It's a good effort, even though I think his successes \\"Stan\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" have got him going commercial. Maybe some hard-core fans won't like this record like the other two. I think this album shows us an Eminem who is less depressed that the first album, less aggressive that the second one and who has mellowed a bit, showing us a softer side to himself like in the song \\"Halies song\\". Highlights include the single \\"Without me\\", even though I think that songs \\"White America\\"(featuring very smart lyrics)\\"Square dance\\" and \\"Say goodby hollywood\\" are the best.\\"Cleaning out my curtains\\"also gives us some typical Shadyish autobiographical lyrics. All in all this is a must-have for any Eminem fan, even though I still prefer \\"Slim Shady\\" over the last two albums.Some of the lyrics prove once again that this guy isn't just an over-the-top punk trying to look cool saying a lot of swear words, some of the things he says actually make you THINK(and that's a first, considering modern day music culture). And about the swear words, as he himself says in \\"White America\\", he ain't the first rapper to be saying those words, he's just the most famous ne.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I love this album!.Best Yet I think.Even though a lot of the<BR>songs sound odd to me it is a good CD to buy.My favorite song<BR>on this album is &quot;Hella Good&quot;.My mom says that they don't say<BR>Hella they say Hell,but obvesely she hasn't seen or heard TLR.<BR>Hella is a slang terme from something though I can't remember.<BR>Anouther get song is &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.At first I hated the song.<BR>I didn't knw who it was by until one day some person on the<BR>radio said it was No Doubt.Then I decided to listen to it.It<BR>was a wierd but odd but cool song.Even though I have never <BR>heard of Bounty Killer before.You should get this album cause<BR>it's great and remember to always feel a Hella Good.
6305546789|5.0|\\"Halloween\\" is the first genuinely scary horror film I had<br />the displeasure of seeing as a 10 year old boy.  I still<br />have nightmares to this day of Michael Myers' simple, plain white<br />mask that was a stroke of genius on Carpenter's part.  it's<br />an image that has become synonymous with terror!  With groundbreaking camera work, fresh actors, and goreless killings, this was a new blueprint for horror films.  Following in the footsteps of Hitchcock's \\"Psycho,\\" Carpenter created an extraordinary environment as dark and merciless as Michael Myers<br />himself.  This is a film to be felt and experienced. \\"Halloween\\"<br />may end as you view the final credits, but Myers lingers just<br />outside your window for years to come.
B00005OM4N|4.0|When I first got this CD(which was a long time ago in Feb.,but I've been to lazy to write about it)I was really happy.I thought it would be the best of my CD's,but after I wasn't so thrilled about it.This CD has some nastey and odd songs to it.After seeing \\"I'm a slave for you\\" I felt an unpleasant feeling.Having to be LICKED during the video was not right.I also notice that she said \\"you try to WRAPE me\\" in song \\"Let me be\\".I also didn't like the fact that she is just about to show something on the front.And if you look through out the little booklet thing she strikes so gross poses.Don't get me wrong or anything she is a great singer and a lot of her songs on this CD are good.Plus her previous CD's are good,but she kindof went through a change that she shouldn't have gome through.But if you haven't noticed it's also happened to Pink.But all this is just my opionon and you don't have to listen to it.In away I wish you would.
B00005JLEX|5.0|If I could have one wish in the whole world it would to have all of Seinfeld´s 9 seasons on DVD. Why has it taken so long to at least release one season considering all the other shows that have and aren´t half as good as Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer? Who ever is in charge of deciding to release the shows on DVD, for the sake of all the Seinfeld fans around the world.....PLEASE DO IT!!!!
B0000004V2|5.0|When the music scene starts becoming stale and boring, along comes an artiste to wipe out the old and herald the new. The Stone Roses were such artistes, arriving at a time when the mainstream was dominated by washed up 80s bands. While I'm a fan of Duran Duran et al, by the late 80s they were crap. Acid house culture was still underground. Along come the Stone Roses, who fused 80s dance sensibilites with 60s pop melodies while still creating something utterly contemporary (for it's time anyway). <br />Starting steadily with I Wanna Be Adored, with it's assured bassline hinting away at a full dance track which comes right at the end, the funked up 10 minute magnum opus Fool's Gold, the Roses' eponymous debut is a classic through and through. Along the way are attacks against the system (Scarborough Fair re-write Elizabeth My Dear, I Am The Resurrection) and what appear to be odes to Ecstasy (pretty much everything else).<br />Ian Brown delivers his lyrics confidently and with poise, John Squire's guitar give the music a certain uplifting power, and the rhythm section...Reni is undoubtedly one of the best drummers in history, and combined with Mani's above average playing create one of the best rhythm sections of all time. On tracks like She Bangs The Drums the hooks blend in effortlessly with the rhythms, creating sounds that one never dreams possible. I've heard the original acoustic version of She Bangs The Drums and it's amazing to hear it's progression. Other standouts for me are Fool's Gold (or Fools Gold as it's printed on my CD), Ressurection, Made of Stone, Elephant Stone, Waterfall...heck the whole CD's great.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Ok. I know theres many anti britney ppl out there. and theres also many brit fans~ Well I'd say Im just a music lover and have nothing against the girl but this cd looses some of the old Brit style. I loved \\"Baby One More Time..\\" and \\"Oops.. I Did it Again\\" but there were a few songs I didnt like on her new album.<br />Some of my favorites are Overprotected, Lonely, Not a Girl; Not Yet a Woman, and Cinderella. None of the songs were awful but I like to hear her sing and in some of the songs theres too many sound effects to even make out her voice.<br />I hope her next album focuses more on her vocals than her vocals being tuned out by sound efefcts. Sometimes her voice sounds abnormal due to the effects and I thought that was a drawnack.<br />But other than that Brit has a pretty good album out and I love listening to some of the songs~ I just wish she would get back some of her old musical style~
B00006690F|5.0|He's back again as he says this is his best album so far.And his production skills are very good and he also gets help from Dr.Dre who drops three great beats for Eminem.\\"Buisness\\" is a song to look out for great beat and Eminem saying that he's back.To be honest every song on this album is very good if not excellent even \\"Haile's song\\" were he's actually singing and then for the final verse he goes back rapping.This album is he's most personnal record and I think that's when he's at his best.Cleaning out my closet is his ongoing problem with his mother and some of the lyrics are rougher than on the last record.  \\"Till I collapse\\" feat Nate Dogg is off the hook banging beat and Nate Dogg brings it again as usual.The song were he has his daugther is very good and a great hook were she's answering to him.Every song is brilliant. You've got to get this album.

0140186409|3.0|This book was one I read over summer because of the length of it.  Its a revealing story that depicts true poverty and the struggle for survival.  Steinback does an extraordinary job on giving us a glimpse of what life would be like if jobs and food was limited. It was shocking to see what people were willing to accept for a hard day's work.  Families were broken up , children were starved  and put to work, it was really demoralizing.  This book was basically the struggles of a family in the 1930's to make it to the West where &quot;work was plentiful&quot; , but later discover that things are not how they pictured them.  It was a great book but it was a little lengthy.
006016848X|4.0|Having read this book from cover to cover, I found myself picking it up and reading sections again every now and then.  Every time I read a new section, it was like opening my eyes to my own relationships.  John Gray, thank you for this groundbreaking, easy to read, down to earth guide to all our relationships.<br />Even if you have a strong relationship, there are practical ways and suggestions to improve communication, and simply just make life better.  Highly recommended.
B00006690F|5.0|Em has finally grown up...but thats not always a good thing. Last year's album \\"The Marshall Mather's LP\\" was great not only because of its beats, but its out-of-control lyrical content. This one doesn't have the same shock value, but it is better in way of lyrics. Eminem sets many things straight with his new album. He doesn't actually go after anyone in the new record but instead defends himself. He returns blows to Moby, Chris Kirkpatric, his mom, his ex-wife, and more notably, the Bush administration and the Cheney family. Eminem has proven to stand up and take aim at the current state of the U.S and the drafting process. You can really tell how much Eminem has grown since his first record. I think in some ways this surpasses his last effort, but also in some ways falls short. I don't think this will rile up as much controversy as last time, but will gain Eminem respect from the critics. Overall this is an album you can't miss. Oh, and the DVD is a real nice touch.
0385484518|4.0|This book somewhat resembles a diary. A young man visits his old dying teacher, and learns more about life than he bargains for. It is one of those books, that can be a catalyst for a life-changing experience for a reader.  At the very least it can wake you from the doldrums of life and encourage you to take a long hard look at yourself, and examine where you are personally heading along lifes treadmill.<br />With 191 pages, and the lines well spaced out, it is easy to get into and doesn't take very long to read. Highly recommended.
B00005JKJA|5.0|i didnt know what to expect of this film when i first saw it. i had heard reviews that trashed it and those that praised it. when i saw it though, i was entranced. this is a masterpiece of filmwork. <br />i think that the point of mulholland drive is to critize hollywood. if you notice Naomi Watt's character throughout the film, goes from a beautiful angelic innocent woman fresh from one of the most wholesome lands, Ontario Canada, to someone torn down to utter dispair. the phantasmagoric filmwork is superb and adds powerful tension to the plot. the twists may be hard to understand, but they fit in the story quite well. after all, what is an actor or an actress? who are they really?
0452282152|3.0|Tracey Chevalier's idea to write a story about the famous painting 'Girl with a Pearl Earring', by Johannes Vermeer, is very intriguing and unique.  Griet, the main character, was  often frustrating with her withdrawn  manner and lack of confidence in herself. This itself is probably a reflection of her status in society in 17th century Europe.  I found it disappointing that the painter himself was not really brought into the story as well as he could have been.  We only  were given an indepth look into Griet's character, and the story was seen soley from her perspective.  The plot was luke warm around the relationship of Griet (his maid) and the painter, but we discover that Griet has an artistic ability, that adds light to an otherwise monotonous plot.  I was drawn to reading this book by the idea behind it. It is a good, light read, and one which I recommend .
0451450523|5.0|In the genre of fantasy, there are few books that can be considered \\"classics,\\" as it's very difficult to create a classic and universally-loved story set within a fantasy world. Members of this elite club include \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by J.R.R. Tolkein, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Caroll, and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" by C.S. Lewis. Peter S. Beagle also joins this membership with his classic \\"The Last Unicorn\\", a beautfully crafted and utterly wonderful story.<br />The story deals with a unicorn who discovers she is the last of her kind. She sets out to find her missing race, but ends up with more than she bargains for. With the help of a bumbling magician and a maid, she must face an evil king who uses a mysterious creature for a purpose not even she could imagine.<br />The story is perhaps one of the most beautifully crafted stories in all of fantasy. It is far from being an epic - it's more of a short story that happens to be long - but it still makes for a captivating read. And the story doesn't always take itself seriously; there's a kind of wry humor that might be found in a Disney-like cartoon. However, \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is far from a Disney-esque book. There is a subtle yet undeniable dark tone in the story, and the characters have real personalities and character development, with flaws and irregularities. In the span of a relatively short novel, Beagle's world is realized with such amazing beauty and skill it's difficult not to be engrossed in his simple yet elegant prose.<br />Although it's most likely out of print by now, I seriously reccommend finding this book. If \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the Bible of fantasy, then \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is the equivalent of a book written by Max Lucado. It's suitable for all ages, and it beats the movie by a long shot. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel satisfied. \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is one of fantasy's unquestionable classics.
B00006690F|5.0|The hype surrounding this album has been huge. So huge in fact that the release date for the album was pushed forward a week due to the album being bootlegged so badly on the net....it's truly worth it. The bonus DVD is good too, basically there just to promote eminems new movie, and his various DVD's he got out or that are coming out. <br />Now to the cd, if you liked his previous work, then I reakon you will like this. There's only like two songs that I dont really like on the album, but those can still be listened to. Some of Em's strongest songs are on this cd, including White America, Cleanin Out My Closet, Sing For The Moment, and Hailie's Song. Some of Em's strongest and most thought-provoking raps are also featured on this album. Em's daughther even does guest vocals on My Dad's Gone Crazy. The cd features 20 tracks, with 5 being skits and intro/outro's. That leaves 15 songs, 13 of which I really enjoy, alot more than his previous albums. Be wary though, this album does take a different direction to his previous work, with Em's songs not poking so much fun at others, but more focusing on his life, ex-wife, daughther, friends, foes and anything else thats crosses Marshall's mind. <br />If there was anything that I'd have to say is wrong with this album, it's that it's Eminem. If you didn't like him before you probably won't like him now. And also the fact that there is far too few guest vocalists. Don't get me wrong, Eminem is a great rapper and lyracist, but sometimes it sounds good to have another rapper or pair of vocals break a track up a bit. Mind you most of the songs have a guest vocalist or a sample for the chorus.<br />Anyway, buy this album if you like Em. If you don't then buy it anyway, you might be surprised. This is his best and strongest album to date. Expect to hear alot of the songs off this cd on the radio, as all the ones I like a very catchy.
B00006690F|2.0|Eminem grew up in a trailer with his Mother who he hates and clawed his way up the rap scene even though he's white.  We get it OKAY?  No need to give us a history lesson on each album.<br />My biggest problem with the songs on this album is that the \\"music\\" is little more than a few loops tossed together.  Take away his rap voice-over and there isn't much there.<br />This is more like a humor album, since Eminem whines about the price of fame and how it's ruined his life; so he puts out another album that's probaly going to sell several million copies?
B00006690F|5.0|He is innovative in his tracks. All tracks are original and no hooks or beats are repeated. In no way, along the entire cd, did I get bored, tired of the beat, or wanted to skip to a different track. 19 full quality tracks. Dre said that, \\"he worked very hard on this cd.\\" This cd does not even talk about drugs. His main stream point was his life. I believe - and many agree with me - that this cd is better than his first cd. If you were dissappointed in D12 (like I did), you won't with this cd. I promise you (and I don't like buying alot of cd's or wasting my money). I thought that his first cd was very creative and that coming up with new, innovative, and story filled tunes will be rare, but his new cd is filled with real, down-to-earth stories about him, the media, his mom, and his daughter, and is filled with addicting melodies that flows with his melodies. In the 2nd track, he tells a story about how he is labelled 'white rapper'. In track 19, last track, his hook is done by his daughter, rapping about how he could be crazy. This track is cute, funny, and addicting. And throughout the cd, from the first track to the 19th, my head cannot stop bouncing.<br />I enjoy this cd because he is very down to earth in his songs throughout his cd. He mixes comedy and real life very well. His life story is on the cd. After listening to it, you will learn about his mom, his ex-wife, his daughter, his experience with the media, racism, bad publicity, and etc..<br />If you thought Nas cd was an excellent Cd, or if you thought that Eminem's first cd was excellent,.. you have to listen to this Cd...
B00004UEDQ|5.0|ok im a 17 year old guy who loves chick flicks so what. this was a awesome movie. at the beggining you see sandras charector getting drunk at her sisters wedding. she ruins the wedding cake. goes to get a new one and crashes into someones porch alas she is sent to rehab. steve busciemi is in it too as the main counsellor.  this was fun. my favorite charector was the german guy in the rehab.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie was exellent.  I warn viewers though, only watch this if you're in the mood to think, because you'll be doing plenty of that by the time the movie is over.<br />At first I doubted this movie, but after a while it occurred to me that if David Lynch (writer and director), even though I have no idea who he is, put his name on the cover, then he must be proud of something in the movie.  And, being as I work at a video store and get to watch videos for free, I watched it.<br />The movie does a very good job at avoiding stereotypical scenes (i.e. cat jumps up and scares someone scene or the \\"phew that was close\\" then something bad happens scene).<br />One of the outstanding aspects of this movie is the sound.  Music always matches what is going on.  Also, maybe this is a personal preference, but I love the use of dead silence to make things scarrier.  There were many wonderful moments in the movie where the only thing you can hear is the DVD player running.<br />Acting: C -=- 76 out of 100 points<BR>Story: B+ -=- 87 out of 100 points<BR>Sound: A+ -=- 100 out of 100 points<BR>(BONUS) Avoiding Stereotypical Scenes   +10 points<BR>(BONUS) Lesbianism   +10 points<BR>(BONUS) Smart-alleck Nerdy Character   +10 points<BR>-------------<BR>Overall 97.6% (293 out of 300 points)
B00003CXTG|3.0|but not better than black hawk down. definetly not as much action. this stars ben afleck , josh hartnett, kate beckinsale , alec baldwin, and william fichtner. its overlong. i want the directors cut though. 4 discs rated r for more action but 1 hourlonger. this movie has the subplot of titanic. sappy romance.
B000001DQI|5.0|In my opinion, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road it's the best of Rock and Roll albums.A lot of people say Beatles Sgt Peepers it's was the best Rock album and i did't believe because in Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Elton John explore genres like blues and converted in rock and roll songs.In &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot;, Elton play a beatiful piano in a great instrumental song.&quot;Bennie and The Jets&quot; was a massive hit, a rollicking rocker, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; it's a super-song and inspirate Elton to make a tribute to Princess Diana in 1997. The rebeld song &quot;Saturday Night Alright for Fighting&quot;was a tribute to American(and English) rock and roll.&quot;Harmony&quot; is wonderful &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; it's a great country-rock song.If you love Elton John or rock and roll, buy more quicly this album
B00000G3I2|5.0|i loved this movie. i had heard alot about this movie from my mother who loves it so one day last summer i decided to watch it. i loved it too. great soundtrack including alot of 60s and 70s music. great acting particuarally glenn close. great story. just a perfect movie.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This Chili Peppers best album song-wise and singing-wise.  John Frusciante hasn't gotten back in guitar-playing shape on this one, but it's still a must-have album.
B00005ASOC|5.0|An EXTRODINARY film<br />Gus Van Sant...is the complete artist.
630438551X|5.0|I totally recommend this video! It's one of the best film's i have ever seen. The cast is well chosen, the music is hip and the story is so sad, but even funny at times. It's a must see movie!!!
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem is an incredible rapper and with his latest album, The Eminem Show, he proves it. With songs that contain the illest beats you've ever heard to him actually singing in Hailie's Song. Em proves time and time again that the color of his skin is just a facade to what he really is about, and that is rap. He is one of the truest rappers out there and from his lyrics you can tell what he's going through. Eminem prove to us that he can sing, and his incredible lyrics combined with Dre's hot tracks just bring us another album to praise.
B00005YU1O|1.0|The Waking Life team has undercut George Lucas's business model. Mr. Lucas spends several hundred million dollars creating a world so compelling that people flock to it despite an an incoherent plot, superficial characters, and sophomoric dialog. <br />J. C. Shakespeare et al. create their world on a much more modest budget. The method is tape some random writers/professors/sages/street poets -- some stoned crazy, some just naturally bizarre, all spouting some nonsense -- with a hand held camcorder, digitize the footage into a Macintosh, and have animators paint over each frame in colorful and artistic ways. If the sage gesticulates at lot, the hands are exaggerated, if he flashes his eyes, the eyes and so on.<br />Like Lucas, the result is merely eye candy. Although the target audiences are very different, the acid test for both is to ask, \\"What would be left if the visual pyrotechnics were removed?\\" In both cases, very little. If you want to see a great movie about dreams, try Kurosawa's \\"Dreams\\". An episodic movie that that honestly captures the dream state cinematographically....
B00005AR3G|1.0|Its incredible to see such a mistake.  I want to think of it as a mistake and not of a lack of interest in history.  All the story happens in the Andes and all the names are Quechua (pacha) or peruvian cities (cuzco).  But there are several parts of the movie that they mix the peruvian history with the mexican history.  You can also hear mexican music and mexican accent in the way they talk.  As a peruvian I felt very disappointed when I saw this movie.  We latin-american countries are not all the same. Peru is  very different from Mexico and they have to respect the history of each country.
0790729652|5.0|I don't understand complaints that this movie is &quot;too dark&quot; - Batman is one of the darkest, if not THE darkest, mainstream superheroes around. Burton realized Gotham City brilliantly; the towering buildings and absolute lack of sun (it's always either night, cloudy, or inside) emphasizes how hopeless and crime-riddled the city is, and how much it needs Batman.<br />Michael Keaton seems like an unusual pick for the role of the brooding Bruce Wayne, but he plays the offhand-but-guarded role very well. Instead of coming off as as uncool good guy-type like Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, he lets a bit of an edge reveal itself in every scene, especially in the &quot;Let's get nuts&quot; scene. Kim Basinger is, well, &quot;charming&quot; in the role of Vicki Vale. Her small gestures and the way she plays off her co-actors is subtle and results in the Batman franchise's only worthwhile female lead. But the show really gets stolen by Jack Nicholson, who is brilliant as The Joker; his performance is practically effortless as he says, &quot;Where does he get those wonderful toys.&quot;<br />Batman is a movie dark enough to do the comic honour, but it's not exactly a think piece, so it's a perfect movie to watch with some friends. Yay Batman!
B00006690F|5.0|From the time his first major Lp dropped Eminem has been able to live up to the hype. With His new album and more eyes on him than before, due to the huge success of \\"The Mathers Lp\\" He needed a homerun. He Got it. From the first track \\"White America\\" when he unleashes on anyone that has questioned anything he's said, done or been rumored about, and it doesn't slow from there. The quick discarding of Canibus on \\"Square Dance\\" and JD on \\"Say What You Say\\" not to mention the Obvious lyrical jabs on \\"Without Me\\" say it's still better to have Slim with you than against you. But it's the production thats the real treat on this album, Eminem handling the majority of the beats, makes him an artists, artist, proving that is mic skills are best matched by his style of beat, that only his twisted mind could think up.Heads knew it was possible when he showed new style on \\"Renegades w/Jay-Z\\" but it appears that Eminem is posed to have his named mentioned with Big,Jay,Nas,and Pac, and at this rate may make the top of a very tight list.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Though Akira falls into the trappings of most anime (some far off crazy plot point that is never explained but is supposed to have a &quot;deep&quot; meaning) it doesnt take itself sooooo seriously that it turns into awful mush. Akira handles the mysterious parts of the story in a way that you feel you've gotten enough to understand the goings on, unlike that horrible princess mononoke which some people have the audacity to say is better than Akira. This film is classic because it takes the best of japanese animation without making it too confusing and warped to understand.
B00001NFCY|5.0|HUMAN CLAY is CREED's sophomore effort, and it picks up where PRISON left off. The album is full a heavy guitar riffs and Scoots Strapps vocals. The band doesnt mess with the formula that made their first album a success.  ARE YOU READY? and WHAT IF ask us the questions that we probably deal with on a daily basis, these 2 songs kick off the album and they are rocking tunes. BEAUTIFUL is the next song and it rocks as it deals with the shallowness of beautiful people. WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN is the song from this album that really blew up and unless you are deaf everybody has heard it atleast once. Scott wrote the song right after he found out he was going to be a father and it is quite a beautiful song. SAY I is another song that has strong melodies along with heavy riffs . HIGHER was the first single from the album and it deals with trying to reach for that better place to live you life at. The thing I like best about this album is the sometimes eiree sound that many of the songs start off with then the just kick into high gear. I would also say that you give WRONG WAY, FACELESS MAN and WASH AWAY THOSE YEARS a good listen to, I dont think you will be disappointed.
B00003CXBK|1.0|The only reason people like this movie is for the visuals. The story itself is confusing, stupid, and all around not very good. The main character messes up things time and again and you slowly lose any sympathy you originally had for him. Add to that the fact that no one learns anything in the end of the film, the evil humans are still evil, the dumb kid is still just as dumb. One of my friends recommended this too me so me and 2 other people sat for 2 hours trying to like it. When we told my friend we all hated it she said \\"But wasnt it pretty\\" and truth be told thats the only reason anyone would like this film. If you wanna see something pretty then watch crouching tiger or something, at least that had a plot.
0451191153|1.0|I could have justified giving this book two stars, or even three. It is, after all, well and cleverly written. It is seductive, easy to get caught up into the plot and hard to resist caring about the characters, even when your head tells you that you REALLY don't even marginally like any of them. Also, there are parts of Rand's \\"philosophy\\" that are undeniably true, and need to be heard in the modern world. But she's made it clear that she prefers honest hatred to indifference, so I'll do her that much courtesy.<br />The biggest problem with this book is the \\"romantic interest\\", a term which I use advisedly. The main character is supposed to be Rand's concept of the ideal man; one must therefore assume that the female lead must be the ideal woman for such a man (after all, if he's ideal, he wouldn't fall for just anybody, right?) and their relationship must also be ideal.<br />That relationship begins with him raping her. No, this is not an exaggeration, it isn't date rape, it's actual, honest-to goodness, no mistake or confusion rape. But that's okay, because it's only what she secretly wanted from him, and certainly what she had coming; she was, after all, a snotty rich woman who'd treated him with a lack of respect just because he was (so far as she knew) a common laborer.<br />Does anybody else out there see a problem with this concept? How about the fact that she spent the rest of the book trying to convince herself that she deserved him, because his treatment of her earned her worship?<br />There are other problems with the philosophy expressed in this book, as if there's actually any need for MORE reasons. But this one is sufficient in itself to make the book utterly worthless, in spite of the validity of SOME of its message. Those parts of the message can be found in other books that do not have the baggage that this one carries. I recommend \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" by Ken Kesey.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is the only Pink Floyd CD I have, but it is one of my favorite albums.  I don't know what all this whining about the whole thing being one continous track is about, you were all expecting too much.  I'm not real big on their early music but I still listen to it, sometimes.  The best songs on here are probably from The Wall and The Dark Side of the Moon.  Comfortably Numb, Hey You, and The Wall Pt. 2 are my favorites.  I do wish; however, that The Wall Part 1 was on here to complete the three part song.  The only disapointment I have in the album is the absence of Have A Cigar.  I caught on to this song through the Foo Fighters remake and love it.  Overall I recomend this album to anyone who has the money to buy it.  Pink Floyd is the second or third best British band ever but who come compete with the Beatles or Rolling Stones.  In my opinoin at least, they're the best.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This two and a half hour long fantasy adventure was not only able to get kids to come and sit through it once, but draw them back several more times. The folks at Warner Brothers realised that kids saw it in theaters until they were sick of it. Also, many people purchased or downloaded a bootlegged copy of the film. To get the same results on video that the film had in theaters, Warner Bros. has added several deleted scenes to the film. Also, there is an added disc with more deleted scenes, plus many other special features including a virtual tour of Hogwarts and the making of the film.<br />Harry Potter is eleven years old and lives withe his mean aunt and uncle, and their little son Dudley. Harry has always been told that his parents died in a car accident and that the lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead was from the accident. But on his birthaday, he discovers that he is a wizard and that his parents were murdered by the evil Lord Voldermort. When Voldermort tried to kill Harry, the spell backfired leaving Harry with the scar and reducing Voldermort to almost nothing. Harry is sent to Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards, where he meats Ron and Hermoine, his two best friends, and descovers that the Sorcerer's Stone, wich has the power to bring Lord Voldermort back to full powere, is being kept in the school. Harry also learns that a teacher in the school is helping the Evil Lord get to the stone. Harry must get to the stone before all is lost. <br />The acting was great. Danial Radclieff is perfect as Harry Potter. John Willams does the score. His other works include The \\"Star Wars\\" saga and \\"E.T.\\" Adults and children will love Harry Potter. And there is no devil worship in it for those of you who don't know what you are talking about trying to bann the movies and books wich are about an innocent little child who lives in a magical world. You will love \\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\\", the first of seven movies to be made by Warner Bros.
B000005RTG|3.0|When this came out I did not really like this at all.In all fairness I did not relly give it the chance it deserved.Now<BR> 26 years later I found it second hand and picked it up.(good<BR>move).I was listening a bit to Deep Purple again and it has really grown on me.I think at the time I wanted Blackmore,Gillan and Glover back in the band and therefore disliked it before giving it much of a chance.Now, dont you make the same mistake.
B00006690F|5.0|This Album was originally supposed to be released in June, but Eminem pushed the date up because of internet trading and Bootlegging.<br />I thought this album would [stink], but there are alot of good tracks, including a song with Haley, and Say What U Say, a song letting J.D know how Dre and Eminem feel. The Bonus DVD is awesome, there is the video of \\"I just don't give a..\\" and a cartoon \\"The Slimshank Redemption\\".
6300267997|3.0|It seems to me as though most of the reviewers are anti-Barbra rather than against this movie. I've read reviews that criticize the wardrobe, the songs.... sorry to point this out, but the clothing and hairstyles WERE in style when the movie was made. As another review pointed out, this was the era of Carly Simon, James Taylor, etc., so to say that Esther's songs wouldn't have been accepted by a &quot;stoned-out&quot; crowd is not necessarily true. <br />It's completely camp, but still fun to watch. I wish Kristofferson would've done a better job singing, but I thought he was effective portraying a man out of control. Like Esther, I was repelled by his actions but felt I could like the person. In that respect, he's spot-on. The film has decidedly too many close-ups of Barbra, which can be annoying, but I recommend it to anyone who wants a little cheese with their wine.
B00000273P|5.0|\\"From Langley Park To Memphis\\" is a masterpiece of lyrical literacy it is difficult for me to imagine anyone surpassing. However, McAloon in his heyday (1985-1990) was so skilled at writing lyrics that thrill me with their literacy that he attempted to outdo himself yet again.<BR>Though the opener \\"Looking For Atlantis\\" is a slight misstep with its self-indulgent lyric, the music and playing are more impressive even than on \\"From Langley Park to Memphis.\\" The next four songs are delicate pop, except for the dense funk of \\"Carnival 2000\\", a brilliant track highlighted by powerful horns and percussion. \\"Machine Gun Ibiza\\" is the most accessbile song on the whole album, but contains yet another wonderfully literate chorus in \\"Well you've earned the right to hang out with/Machine Gun Ibiza - Voodoo up rollmo' down/Machine Gun Ibiza/Hanging' ten with the hurrican sound.<BR>The next four songs relate to the life of Jesse James and Elvis Presley, and are highlighted by the brilliant \\"Moondog\\" with its wonderful piano line. The next group of songs include the beautiful ditty \\"All Boys Believe Anything\\" and \\"The Ice Maiden\\", a tribute to ABBA [I'm not a fan myself] that shows McAloon at his most literate. \\"Paris Smith\\" is a dream of a bad marriage for McAloon's vocal partner Wendy Smith, a theme continued in the next song \\"The Wedding March\\", their sparsest song ever.<BR>The next three songs represent a plea for mercy from God and include the beautiful \\"One Of The Broken\\" with its semi-spoken vocal, and \\"Michael\\" (a reference to the archangel) on which McAloon's vocal sounds quite like Tori Amos (before Amos' time!), but manages to pull it off with some brilliant lines like \\"Ambition took me speed of light/To God's exclusion zone\\". \\"Mercy\\" is another short and beautiful ballad, and these tracks show him distancing himself from the fascinations with witches and idolatry he showed on previous albums.<BR>The record then takes a sharp turn with the hard-rocking but wonderfully tuneful, even beautiful \\"Scarlet Nights\\", with Neil Conti's most powerful drumming since \\"The Golden Calf\\", and Wendy Smith making more prominent vocal contributions than on previous albums. The final track \\"Doo Wop In Harlem\\" continues the themes outlined in \\"From Langley Park To Memphis\\"' \\"Hey Manhattan\\", but is an extremely slow piano-driven ballad.<BR>On the whole, this is a more diverse set than the two previous masterpieces, and is probably not the best introduction to a band whose best music is essential for any music fan. However, no flaws can really be found with \\"Jordan: The Comeback\\" - it further solidifies McAloon's wonderful songwriting skills.
0385505833|3.0|Skipping Christmas was a nice little story that I thought was just a little too cute.  It was predictable and is written from the point of view that everyone except \\"the nice jewish couple down the street\\" is a Christian who simply must get into the Christmas Spirit.

B00006690F|4.0|Eminem has manged to produce yet another album that is full of great tracks that stays true to his roots.  The Eminem Show, is bound to offend some people, as his previous albums have, but then if you dont like it you dont have to listen.  Without Me is the first single release and its shows you what you can expect from this album.  A must have for any fan
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Having suddenly remembered that Shannon Elizabeth is in this movie, I decided to watch it for a second time.  I enjoyed it much more this time than I did originally.  Surely, it is incredibly stupid and rather tasteless, but there are several laughs for every grimace.  I imagine that this movie would be much funnier in a movie theater with a bunch of other people around you, but it's still a hoot when viewed solo.  Anna Farris plays her leading role well; I love her Drew Barrymore-ish mannerisms.  Carmen Electra's cameo gets the movie off and going at an appropriately funny, spoofish level, and the Wayans are as funny as ever. I love Shannon Elizabeth, but her final scene did seem a little over the top even for this kind of silly film.  For me personally, the scenes featuring the permanently doped up Shawn Wayans character are the funniest in the film, especially when the killer joins his bong party.<br />I enjoy trying to figure out just what is being spoofed when.  If you know nothing about the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer movies, you almost certainly will find this film inane, but the fact is that all kinds of things are spoofed.  A horror fan such as myself can even spot some rather obscure references to such flops as Thinner.  If I live to be 100, I will still find the whole Whaaaazup gimmick hysterical.  I noticed a lot more little nuances on this second viewing, such as the names of the beers in the refrigerator, so I think the people who enjoy this movie can have some fun watching it more than once.  A lot of people will simply not like this movie; if you don't enjoy horror or juvenile humor, then you shouldn't buy it (unless you have to have it simply because Shannon Elizabeth is in it).  I dare anybody not to laugh at some point in the movie, but you probably need to have a somewhat twisted sense of humor and a natural affinity for horror in order to really enjoy yourself.  If you think you won't like Scary Movie, then you're probably right..
0679437223|5.0|Heller's style is very similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, and being a huge Vonnegut fan, I really enjoyed Catch-22.  The structure of the story was very interesting too - each chapter was about a different character, such that instead of getting a whole story, you get glimpses of the story from many different perspectives, which I think helped develop the characters very well.<BR>The Everyman's Library edition is a very good looking book.  And not as bulky as usual hard covers.
B00005R23S|5.0|Some day someone will make the perfect rock concert DVD. Until then, this one will be the benchmark. Just short of perfect, it's got all the magic and energy of a live concert, but with better views of Bruce and the Band.<br />Fifty-two years old, thirty-something years of performances behind him, Bruce Springsteen remains transcendant. Reunited with the E Street Band, he shows in song after song why he is the very best: there is nothing held back, there is nothing artificial and there's nothing between you and what he feels and believes. All those years down the road and he still believes passionately that rock and roll can save us and redeem us.<br />The DVD has two disks. The first is the HBO broadcast, and also includes &quot;New York City Serenade,&quot; largely a worshipful interview by Bob Costas. The second DVD has eleven additional songs, a few of them superior to much on the first DVD.<br />Let me recommend especially &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams,&quot; Bruce's answer to the spiritual &quot;This Train Is Bound for Glory,&quot; and a lot more. Bruce's train, I promise, you, is a lot more inclusive. If &quot;41 Shots&quot; doesn't move you, if 'Layna's plea to her son doesn't give you goose bumps, then you must be dead. And if hearing the members of the E Street Band sing the promises of &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; to each other doesn't give you hope for the next album, well, go break out your Lawrence Welk records and stop bothering rock fans.<br />With each album, with each concert, Bruce Springsteen reaffirms his belief that rock and roll can save your soul. Buy this DVD. See for yourself.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem has done it again. Not all artists are able to make one, let alone, two good cd's in a row. Eminem did, with Marshall Mathers. Now, yesterday, he released the Eminem Show. The CD has, for a good surprise, and his first time, the lyrics, printed in the cd booklet. The Eminem Show is Marshall at his darker side. Eminem blasts several people, from President Bush, to Moby. Even Elvis doesn't go unnoticed. ofcourse, that's the fun of having a new Eminem Cd, is to see who, and how many people get slammed. He delves into his relationship with his mom, ouch, and Kim, and his daughter, and Dr. Dre. One of the highlights of the album is a song called Square Dance. It's a very poignant view point of America, and of Eminem's feelings<br />about his own life. Of course, the all the songs have his rhymes, and his rapping. I didn't notice any song that's, well, catchy like \\"I Am\\". But, why does a song need to be catchy?<br />Maybe that's not how Eminem is feeling right now.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you haven't seen Shrek, run out and do so right this minute. I'll wait.<br />Ok, you've seen it now? Good. Didn't you enjoy yourself? What was your favorite part? I don't know that I can actually pinpoint a favorite moment in the movie. I think the reason I like this movie so much (aside from the gorgeous animation) is how irreverently &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt; it is. This movie pokes fun at nearly every fairy tale held sacred by our society, and does so with unabashed glee.<br />Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a big, surly, anti-social, unfriendly ogre. Oh yeah, and he's green. Shrek would like nothing better than to live in peace in his swamp shack, but finds that his routine is shattered by an influx of displaced fairy tale characters, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a small, grey, outgoing, talkative, well... donkey. Shrek sets off to find the source of the sudden flood of fairy folk into his realm accompanied (much to his dismay) by Donkey.<br />As part of a bargain with Lord Farquaad of Duloc (John Lithgow), Shrek is tasked with rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the obligatory dragon. Unable to shake his donkey companion, Shrek heads off to fulfill his half of the bargain. All sorts of merriment ensues, and romance and surprises are at every turn.<br />The phrase &quot;for kids of all ages&quot; may be old and trite, but it describes this movie to a T. There's plenty of overt humor and pratfall silliness (not to mention bright, colorful animation) to fill any youth with glee, but the movie also has much to offer the adult viewer. Subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to other fairy tails, the aforementioned gorgeous animation, and humor abound.
B00006690F|5.0|After the much hyped return of Eminem to the big time stage \\"The Eminem Show\\" seems to have lived up to all it's odds. Eminem's lyrics on this record are some of the most profound lyrics I have ever heard. He throws in a little bit of humor on tracks like \\"Business\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" and then throws in a few serious songs like \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\". My personal favorite is \\"Hailies Song\\". On this track Eminem reveals all of his musical talents by singing, rapping, talking, and humming.It was going to take a great cd to match \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" and I think Eminem did a pretty good job.
B000005QH3|5.0|I saw Vanishing Point for the first time at a drive-in back in 1977. I've seen the movie many times since. I was even fortunate enough to be given the soundtrack to the movie. Overtly, the movie doesn't appear to have much of a plot (just another car chase movie). It may have something to do with the amount of editing that was done. I read somewhere that a significant desert scene was cut from the original. To truely appreciate this movie, the viewer must assume the persona of Kowalski, which by loose definition is having nothing else in life to lose. What sets this movie apart is Kowalski's attitude. He knows that he is in a &quot;no-win&quot;, &quot;no-way-out&quot; situation. But rather than meekly surrendering to defeat, Kowalski decides that freedom is worth paying the ultimate price.
B000003C4K|5.0|For those of you who follow my writing, you know that King Diamond is one of my all time favorites. Megadeth has some great records, and I also like Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning.\\" I'm finding more and more that the greatest material never quite makes it to the masses. The market has been sadly cornered by the Back Street Boys and girly bands. Metallica gave up what made them Metallica to stay on top. I only found about this group by accident. I CAN NOT believe the power of this record. I can't honestly call it another \\"Conspiracy\\" (King Diamond) But I can honestly say that Exodus is actually better than Metallica. The best way to describe this phenomenal record by EXODUS is an interesting cross between Metallica's \\"Kill Em All\\" and Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells, But Who's Buying?\\" The guitar playing is really heavy and intense with good attention to composition. I can't quite say they match King Diamond (another grossly underrated artist). But if you like hair bands, there is really nothing to complain about on this record. The record starts with a lot of power, and maintains it straight through to the finish. Not one song is wasted space. (Try comparing EXODUS to other groups who make 1 or 2 hits and then have to find a way to fill the record up!) Some might complain that the vocals are rough, raw, and not so focused. But that's part of the charm of this kind of music. (Lots of screaming, and not always making out everything being said.) There are some super advocates for EXODUS who feel they defined the era of heavy metal. And even though I am new to them, I honestly feel these people have a very strong argument. Metallica may very well be more popular, but if you ask me, this is the better group. Keep in mind, hard work and effort does not always lead to popularity. King Diamond puts much more work and effort into his records than the popular groups today, and to boot, King Diamond's guitarist Andy La Roque has to be the most grossly underrated guitarist in the industry. My advice boils down to this. If you are a fan of heavy metal and hair bands, this record is an ABSOLUTE GOTTA HAVE.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|i've always loved fiona's work, and this cd reallllly shows her talent. a nice variety of songs...my favorite being &quot;i know&quot;, and i listen to this baby all the time.
B000001DVD|5.0|def leppard is probably my favorite band of all time, and i think HighNdry is the album that pretty much defines the band, the album has killer riffs and awesome singing.  Don't get me rong i like hysteria and pyromania but highNdry simply kicks more [rear] then all the others.  I don't know if it was pete willis's distinctive guitar playing that made the album so great or if it was just the band themselves.  Let it go is the opening track on the album and has a killer chorus and guitar solo.  I myself always like listening to HighNdry(saturday night) to get me going in the morning.  If your a true metal head I suggest you by this album.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you haven't seen Shrek, run out and do so right this minute. I'll wait. <br />Ok, you've seen it now? Good. Didn't you enjoy yourself? What was your favorite part? I don't know that I can actually pinpoint a favorite moment in the movie. I think the reason I like this movie so much (aside from the gorgeous animation) is how irreverently fun it is. This movie pokes fun at nearly every fairy tale held sacred by our society, and does so with unabashed glee.<br />Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a big, surly, anti-social, unfriendly ogre. Oh yeah, and he's green. Shrek would like nothing better than to live in peace in his swamp shack, but finds that his routine is shattered by an influx of displaced fairy tale characters, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a small, grey, outgoing, talkative, well... donkey. Shrek sets off to find the source of the sudden flood of fairy folk into his realm accompanied (much to his dismay) by Donkey. <br />As part of a bargain with Lord Farquaad of Duloc (John Lithgow), Shrek is tasked with rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the obligatory dragon. Unable to shake his donkey companion, Shrek heads off to fulfill his half of the bargain. All sorts of merriment ensues, and romance and surprises are at every turn. <br />The phrase &quot;for kids of all ages&quot; may be old and trite, but it describes this movie to a T. There's plenty of overt humor and pratfall silliness (not to mention bright, colorful animation) to fill any youth with glee, but the movie also has much to offer the adult viewer. Subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to other fairy tails, the aforementioned gorgeous animation, and humor abound.
B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie Smalls a.k.a. Christopher Wallace left a special mark in the hip-hop community and all other rappers look up to him for incepration and love. That's what makes Biggie a true idol to kids of all ages. His lyrics truly describe the heart of the #1 Big Poppa and they truly describe him and his struggles back in the day. Now to the album, Biggie drove this hard to the core and put his heart into it. The best song im my opinion is &quot;Big Poppa.&quot; Every song on this album is great but this shows where Big really shines to the fullest. Enjoy! Biggie 4 ever!
B00003CY6M|3.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed the film and the excellent performances and would have given it a 5* rating, the DVD package is completely misleading. It lists a number of bonus features  that are not available on the disk (at least the one I have). There is no director's comments available for the deleted scenes; there is no &quot;On Set&quot; feature; no director's notes and no storyboards. <br />I do not understand why the packaging lists these features and then they are unavailable. One of the reasons I got the DVD was for these non-existant features. A real disappointemnt!
B00005JHAB|5.0|Matthew's performance has made me look up other films he has been in.  What a sexy man!!  He plays well with Jennifer Lopez and this movie has continued my respect for her.  This movie just makes me feel soft and fuzzy every time I watch it!  What a difference to see a movie that has the first kiss at the very end! Shades of movies long gone by!! The soundtrack truly helped and Bridgette Wilson was just fantastic!  I totally love this movie-though I really can't explain exactly why.  Everything just seems to gel together and put a constant smile on my face!
