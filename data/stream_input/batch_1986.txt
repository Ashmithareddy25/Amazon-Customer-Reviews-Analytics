B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I liked the previous installments in this trilogy better. Nothing wrong with this one, I just didn't think it was as strong.
0307586901|3.0|If you read Martha Stewart's magazine you will know what to expect from this book. Lot's of fun and easy crafts for the holiday's.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! What an amazing book.  I loved every bit of it.  I did not expect some if the things that happened to happen.....<br />I recommend fir everyone to read this book.

The scenery is interesting and my favorite thing is you can &#34;catch&#34; free spins which you use at the slot machiene to win all sorts of stuff. Buy it because its the best FREE game ever!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle app, for it's simplicity, and user friendlyness. And the free book downloads that Amazon offers are abundant. I never tire of using it, and I have installed it on all my tablets and PC's A must have for tablet enthusiasts'.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Such a good book. Really makes you think about money and how to invest and not fall into the typical middle class trap.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Once installed, it still required too much. It came across to me as a NARK program, that wanted to be able to constantly monitor what you were watching. I hate NARK's
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it. Just began reading this one.  Enjoying it as much as the first book. Hard to put down.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|We have 3 Kindle Fires in our house and have a one of these cases for each!! I love it.  I origionally purchased this case over a year ago for my Kindle.  I use it contsantly! My kids have tried without success to break it.  it is light and durable! My Daughter loves the color and my 6 year old boy has dropped his Kindle in this case several times and it has not scratched, chipped, cracked or dammaged the Kindle in any way!!! I would buy this again and I recommend this case to anyone!!!
B00APUQT7I|1.0|I'm really sorry. We loved the first one but each subsequent one keeps getting cheesier and cheesier. And, sad to say, less entertaining. Maybe we are just getting older and older.
B009DZDJU6|4.0|I still loved it though but I do prefer the book :) It was more violent that I thought and the characters in the movie capture what is portrayed in the book..except Henry..he's way more of a playboy in the movie...but a cute one :)
B009VB7QQA|3.0|Wasn't as good as I expected but still a good movie. I didn't feel as if I wasted money. However I wouldn't rent it again.

B008ALAHA4|5.0|I used to have a Macbook Pro 13 Late 2011 with the old adapter, i gave that one to my girlfriend, and when i go to her place i don't need to use my charger, only the adapter so that's great.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Get it now awesome but though if notch is looking at this then make diamonds easyer to find. and make us able to do worldwide servers and not LAN WORLD
B006LSZECO|1.0|I started this book after reading many of the reviews.  In the reviews there was nowhere where it said that the book is filled with the \\"F\\" word.  No one in real life talks with that much swearing, especially a woman.  I was very turned off by the book.  I didn't even end of finishing it because it was so degrading to read.  I don't mind swearing in books, but this was going overboard.  Why can't people write a book without the use of all the profanity.  Don't think I'll read one of her books again if that is the way she writes.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very sweet book. Fun and easy read. I enjoyed it a lot and now I'm looking forward to the movie!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Very good movie. Anyone who watched Firefly would enjoy Serenity. It cleared up several things left hanging when the Firefly ended too soon.
B008KE3960|5.0|Gameplay can be a little tough if you have a small screen but it is great for eight inch plus tablets.
B004ZNAXX2|3.0|The 2 Wall albums are classic albums, \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" a great document of the live shows, and the box set is packaged nicely, love the passes.<br /><br />The 2 \\"Works in Progress\\" are a fascinating listen, but I think it would've been better if they had done it song by song with some sort of commentary. To me, it's not something people are going to listen to a lot, and when I heard the \\"Experience\\" version, felt that covered what people would want to hear. Definitely some changes in lyrics happened from the demos to the end result. For the hardcore fans want it all, they should get \\"Immersion\\".<br /><br />The DVD, I was hoping for the full length concert film, even the circulated bootleg footage would be fine, but all we get is a couple of minutes from the unreleased concert film. Real disappointing, at least put \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and the fan favorites on there! We get the \\"Another Brick in the Wall II\\" promo, which is expected.<br /><br />My problem with the documentary is that they've told the same story elsewhere, and there's always the same thing missing - the making of \\"The Wall\\" album itself. We didn't need a making of the film when we already have that!! We don't have a \\"making of the album\\" documentary, like we do with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\". We need one.<br /><br />Other than the unreleased concert film, what really would've been the icing on the cake was the Jim Ladd interview Roger did in 1980. Track by track, explaining each song, and because it was audio only, would've had plenty of room to include on the DVD. Ladd had also interviewed Roger last year, and maybe there would've been some things to add from that 'revisit' to The Wall.<br /><br />And as other people have mentioned, even if they didn't do a 5.1 mix, why didn't we get the 24 bit, 96 KHz mix on the DVD??<br /><br />To me, \\"Experience\\" gives you everything you need and get your money's worth. That's my recommendation, unless you can find this one heavilydiscounted and got a gift card for Xmas.<br /><br />I would also recommend getting Gerald's \\"Making of Pink Floyd The Wall\\" book.
B009VB97EY|4.0|It was cool. I may become a stripper now. It was a lot of fun to watch. I liked the dance moves.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really great book.  The ending was a little disappointing.<br />I guess I'm one that likes to see the bad guy get what they deserve.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was a horrible movie. I kept falling a sleep on it. Do not waste your money on watching this one.
B004Y042N8|4.0|This game has many levels to play through. the levels do seem to getboring after playing for more then 10 minutes though.
B001F8VRLM|5.0|I love this season. It is very funny and I will get Season 2. I have no complaints. 5 stars all day!
0307895475|5.0|This was an awsome game and it was more then I could ask for. It came in on time and was in good shape
140053271X|5.0|At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite. I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book. I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function, but learned otherwise after it's purchase. All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.<br /><br />Sharp resolution, useful utilities, convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen. Lightweight, durable and well designed. Essay to download free books (I suggest Project Gutenberg). For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.<br /><br />I suggest that you purchase additional memory. Barnes and Noble only allocates 1/4 of a GIG out of 2GIG for your personal library from non Barnes and Noble books. One gig for software to run the Nook and 3/4 for books purchased from Barnes. The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG. I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.
B000KRAP4O|5.0|Good quality. Very good item. I am satisfied. But absent the bag for it. I bought it for my friend.
0140120416|5.0|It's been loads of help. Especially when I'm teaching myself and trying to learn. Love the way they have it spread out and seperated in the parts.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish the books lasted longer, I couldn't put them down. When I finished the 1st book, there was long pause btw  books 1 and 2. Book 1 I owned in paperback, I couldn't find book 2 and wasn't going to skip a book, being the reason for the break btw books. I still want to purchase the books, so I can have the trilogy on my shelf. I wish there were more books to read but not sure how the story would go since it's over.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Great Movie, very well acted, the song were amazing, the backdrop and custumes are outstanding, I saw it 6 times
B0094BB4TW|5.0|helps make it easier to stay in touch instead of just on the phone or the desk top computer. Great app
B004W4N55C|5.0|This app is amazing for when it comes to learning how to play guitar. I can check out my favorite songs and learn how to play them as well as beginner chords.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it. it is great and helps with alot of creative ideas. used it for son's batman birthday party ideas
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is almost too good. It has taken up more time than i want to admit. Careful when you think about downloading this since it is extremely addicting.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well worth the time and money, any military wannabe will enjoy.<br />No matter what branch you are from you will enjoy, SSG, 11B
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I thoughly enjoyed this book. The  way the action was interwoven introducing the various characters made for very easy reading. I recommend this book to all Tom Clancy fans.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this was by far the show of the season thus far. the acting is so good. the costumes are  fantastic!i will watch it again and again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a great reading this book...it sure was my company for two days something to read for fun truly
0307887448|4.0|This is a fun and very easy read for those who like 1980's video games and pop culture. It's not deep and wasn't meant to be. This is a roller coaster ride through 80's nostalgia in the form of a video game in book form. Ready Player One is a world where everyone is plugged into the video game OASIS. When the creater of OASIS dies he leaves his massive fortune to whomever can solve and win his last game within the virtual game. This pits our hero Parzival and his friends against an evil corporation to see who will complete the quest first. Along the way there are many 1980's references dropped. Some work well within the story and some are just thrown out because that's what this book is about: a love of 1980's video game a pop trivia. Ready Player One is entertaining enough but not a \\"year's 10 best\\" book for me. I recommend this to old-school video game fanatics first and 80's pop culture lover's second.
B000SEI230|5.0|This is such a great book! So much better then the movie! It brought tears to my eyes!this is definitely a book you will not want to put down/end
1597801585|3.0|After reading all the reviews I wanted to like this more than I did. The general idea was interesting: a world where genetically engineered food (and people) are both a blessing and a curse. The setting is Thailand in the future where the Thai's are the elite and everyone else (Chinese, Japanese, and Americans) are all lower class people. The genetically engineered windups are lower than dogs. The book roughly follows four different characters through to the conclusion of the book. I would have preferred to see much more of the title character but she only gets (not even) one-quarter of the air-time. The book is very description oriented and was more than I needed as it slowed the pacing down too much. Since I learned very little about the windup girl I felt disappointed as that was my main interest in the story. This was ok but I won't be seeking out any of the author's other books. I give it mild recommendation if you are intersted in ecology-themed stories.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the best game ever. At first I thought the game will be hard but when you play it for a while you will get higher score. Right now I'm in the millions zone and I am happy to be on the leader board. Good game!!
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|The first three chapters are very solid and backed up with copious data.  However, Chapter 4 seems to be a bit of a whistle in the dark.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I am an &#34;older&#34; lady and kind of challenged as far as &#34;games&#34; are concerned, but I will get it figured out.  I didn't see any directions, so will try it again sometime.
B002UEW31I|5.0|I loved this movie.  Although I was disappointed at the the way it ended I enjoyed it and would recommend it to my friends.
B0029XFNA8|2.0|Disc was advertised as being colorized but played only in black and white. Opening menu had a red banner but that was the only color in the entire disc. I tried everything I knew to do but finally gave up.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This is a Must see Movie for anyone who love a Risk taker, who risk it all for a feet that only Happen every 20 or 30 years in Thoroughbred Racing, In My Opinion the First Lady of Thoroughbred  Racing was given the greatest  Race Horse that ever Lived.. Those of You who has Never heard of Big Red , you must see this movie and if you don't cry then You better check yourself and see if you are Human...
B001LX50I2|5.0|Love Anthony Hopkings! This is one of top movies of his and always enjoy watching Red Dragon! Would tell anyone who enjoys Anthony Hopkins to go and watch this movie. Red Dragon is great!!!
B004Y042N8|4.0|I like apps like this one that are a good brain teaser. So far, it's ran well and it's been enjoying to use.
B001IWV030|5.0|One of my old time sit back and relax with Peter Falk! Love Peter Falk in most of his movies and more so as Detective Columbo.<br />I would highly recommend it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent read, and better than what I expected, considering how overdone the time travel theme is, and usually so full of holes the stories come out looking like Swiss cheese.  I agree with other readers that King had gotten a bit sloppy with his endings of late, but I sincerely believe that the King we knew and loved from  It and The Stand is back in full force. Spectacular. Please keep it coming, Steve-O!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You won't be disappointed . . . unlike most serial dramas, this one is fast paced and although there is certainly a continuing thread throughout the series, most specific stories are resolved in individual episodes.  Love it!
B004Y042N8|5.0|I thought it was really fun. You could think of it as a stress helper. It is great for kids to play too! They will think it is really fun.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Good book with honest direction from a veteran writer. Engaging with clarity. Found it to be an encouraging and  enjoyable read.
0765325950|5.0|*** NO SPOILERS UNTIL ALERT ***    This book is the best of the three that were co-written by Jordan and Sanderson and is one of the best of the series. It is lively, enjoyable, well written and provides a good payoff for the series, which given its enormous size absolutely required a good payoff.  A Memory of Light does have some flaws, but those flaws were already written into the series before this book was written.  During the series Jordan opened (and failed to close) too many plot points that were not necessary to the finale of the series.  Many characters that were primary focuses early on hung around in open plot points but did not have a real role in the Last Battle.  This caused a flurry of minor plot line closes that felt artificial and anticlimactic in comparison to the larger and better crafted events of the story.  That said, I enjoyed the book immensely and am very glad the series came to a satisfying close.    *** SPOILERS ALERT FROM HERE DOWN ***    WHAT WORKED    -->  Lots of action that is very well crafted.  The events themselves are exciting, and the writing style conveys that excitement effectively    -->  Constant shifts between characters, locations and events give the battle an epic and chaotic feel that fits the story perfectly    -->  Main characters died in meaningful ways (e.g., Egwene's sacrifice).  It is always tempting for an author (and readers) to become too attached to favorite characters to allow them to die, but in the Last Battle of an age of the world, this would have been very unrealistic    --> The plans made by the Shadow were truly worthy of evil genius.  The attacks were multifaceted, subtle and well thought out    --> Matt's role and character were fantastic and serve as a great counterpoint to some of the heavier drama of the book    --> Lanfear's final gambit to win for the shadow was a master stroke.  It was both surprising and very fitting at the same time.    WHAT DID NOT WORK    -->  The biggest flaw of A Memory ofLight is more a product of the series than a fault of the book itself.  Fundamentally, the biggest problem is that there are a tremendous number of unnecessary plot lines that need to be resolved.  Jordan was always much better at opening plot lines than closing them, and that flaw showed clearly in this book.  A good example of this is the death of Padin Fain.  Padin Fain had been hanging around for no reason for a good part of the series.  He serves no purpose in the Last Battle other than as a dangling detail.  His death could have been an epic part of an earlier novel.  Instead he dies in an abrupt couple of pages that seem more like a footnote than an event.  Another example is Moghedien being conveniently made a damane at the end of the story.  Clearly this was meant as a just deserts ending for her, but it felt trumped up and too convenient.  This was something that would have had much more impact if it occurred earlier in the series rather than wedged in between much bigger and better crafted events    -->  The recurring theme of needing to grow up and let go of insecurities has been over exploited in the series and really should have been absent this far into the story.  After thirteen books of enormous events and character development, I really did not need to read about Perrin finally letting go of his reservations and being the man and wolf he was meant to be.  I for one thought he learned this a while ago.  Some of Rand's musings also felt more like rehashing old material than something he would think during the finale of the story    THE BOTTOM LINE    When reading a series of this size, you want a good payoff at the end.  This book delivers a good payoff and is a very engaging read.  Was the series really worth all of the reading?  It was for me.  In the end Jordan created a world that felt real and relatable with very memorable characters.  I have enjoyed the Wheel of Time Series and wish it a fond farewell.elt real and relatable with very memorable characters.  I have enjoyed the Wheel of Time Series and wish it a fond farewell.

B00125WAWS|5.0|This is set back in a shameful time. It is a fine movie about overcoming ignorance and bigotry using courage and challenging the human spirit to achieve greatness in a world that does not fully acknowledge you. Kudos to the Great Debaters.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|every time I thought the game was over, it turned into a new quest with new games to figure out. lots of fun! worked great on my kindle fire hd.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Many people who I know that have read this book tell me they do not like this book because they don't understand it. Don't let these reviews turn you away from this book. It is a work of art, and only the most intuellectual readers can really appreciate it. I highly recomend reading TFIOS.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very entertaining. The beginning to middle kept me hooked. I was slightly disappointed with the conclusion. That's why I gave it 4 of 5 stars.
0375413405|5.0|went above and beyond my expectations. i know julia is an amazing woman and chef and this book definitely what i was looking for.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I personally like this game. I love the fact that over time you can own a lot more land. You get to manage your own city and buildings. It also helps you out if you ever get stuck.
B000059T00|5.0|One of the most incredible albums (Cds) ever made by such great artist ever combined in history.  Was a missing part of the ultimate collection.

B0012GMZ5E|5.0|This is a great cd and for got how good it was till having it back again. Also since being remastered brought back a lot of sound quality's lost from original Lps in early day.  1 of the best from Johnny Winter ever made...Enjoy.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|Eh, okay so ad-free means external to Angry Birds ads because there are plenty of ads on this app but, all are for the various Angry Bird platforms.  Love the game and my kids love it too.
1402712367|1.0|Printed In China.....Not quality books...  The books seems ok for a child.  Some of the facts do change in the shorter version of the classics in these Classic Starts series. There are too many to list. Hopefully, it won't confuse a child when they read the original book.  I wish Amazon would put in the description of the book that it is printed in China.  Then we can choose if we would like to buy that book or one made in USA or another country.  We won't be buying anymore of these Classic Starts series.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|4 different dragon levels and each one has a lot of games within.  Did the red dragon games and then redid them to beat my own personal scores to attain 3 stars for each.

B001GJ2ZCA|5.0|got it for my boyfriend for his birthday.  He loves this band. And having it play in a vinyl record sounded more aunthentic
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|So beautiful. I have seen this movie many times before however I had no idea there was a COMPLETE VERSION of the film. This version is the best, and only that should be viewed. So many gaps are filled in, and you walk away experiencing a whole new final fantasy. Highly recomended for those who have not seen this movie before, it answers more questions you may have. Especially if you have not played the games.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like the challenge but would like to have access to more coins. It would better if they regenerated more quickley.

B004Y042N8|3.0|For the mathy description, you are trying to find an Eulerian path through the graph. The problem is, there is a really simple algorithm to guide you to the solution: look for a point that has an odd number of lines coming out of it and start there. No odds means start where-ever. Over half the early puzzles have a pair of &quot;odd&quot; points, so they get pretty trivial.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Crouch has woven a tale that makes you say, &#34;what the....?&#34;. the story is refreshing in that it is not the run-of-the-mill and, at least for me, totally unpredictable. my only gripe is that i couldn't put it down and finished the read way too fast-now i'm &#34;bookless' while knowing it's a hard act to follow.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what claims to offer on the Amazon App Store. very helpful to know how much processing time you have left.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|My 3 star review is not for the movies them self, but the quality of the package when i received it. The shipping box was in perfect condition, but the bluray box was damaged, pretty bad, which means that it was damaged before it was packaged and shipped.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me in suspense the entire time. I enjoyed the plot and I really enjoyed the ending because I never saw it coming. I would definitely recommend this book to many people who love suspense and a real good story behind it all.
B0042K6G6Q|5.0|If you're bored with shows like True Blood, this might be for you. The characters are interesting, the longer season gives more character development and the mix of teen angst, humor and seriousness is just right.<br /><br />No commercials = great bonus and Nina Dobrev is a much more effective entertainer than the heroine of that popular movie franchise (that is finally over).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it the characters work great answer they have good  deals it is just so awesome you have to play it
0446580848|2.0|I am not sure how or why this re-tread ever got published. It follows the same format as The Lion: Crazy CIA dude, radical extremist and an angry cop. Major let down with a predictable format. It's only redeeming quality was the detailed look into life in Yemen and its tragic history. Why would DeMille write a book about the revenge of the U.S.S. Cole years after it happened?  Answer: money and writers block.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was a great joy to read and by the end brings on real feeling and passion. The book is scary, funny and of course peculiar

B008COD5OO|4.0|A great movie about a kid that gets in way over his head by hosting a party he can't control. Besides just having hot girls, drugs, alcohol and the party everyone wishes they had been to when they were in High School, this movie does make some genuine points about friendship and coming of age.
B000Q79HTC|5.0|Great movie, highly recommend it. Lots of action and the quality is great. First movie in the series, looking forward to watching the rest.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Book was a slow read the first few chapters, but picked up and was good fir the rest of the book. I really like the Harry Bosch novels.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I love this movie because of the effects and the dynamics on screen of the colors, characters, and atmosphere!  Great!
B0064W65SO|4.0|This Frank Miller's Batman background becomes a much nicer reading because of the parallel with Nolan's trilogy. I highly recommend it!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This movie is great, and I love that, in order to include all the important details from the book, they decided to make two movies for the 7th book!
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Wile I do like this watch, I am not a big fan of the strap.  I would have paid a little more to have the strap lined with leather.  Overall very good quality watch though.  The strap can and will be replaced.  The watch keeps good time.  It is now in my rotation of watches I wear.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love the cast, the story lines - plural, and the way that all they all intertwine!  A classic Christmas movie!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I think I really wasted my money on this one and I LOVE Tina Fey. I started this back in November and I'm still not done it. It's not as funny as I was told and it's a very difficult read!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought this book was interesting because of the view of a medical doctor who know the working of the brain. What happened to him is different than some other peoples' experiences and I am interested in trying to blend them together in thought to see what it brings me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I wish I had a Christen to come home to every night! One messed up guy but this book brings it all together....keep reading
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  And guess what?  ...  The 3D looks AWESOME!  Who cares if it's post...it still looks great!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was realy against this whole series when it first came out, but boy was I hooked. Book 2 was a bit slower then 1 and 3, but it brought the story together. I can't believe I liked this triology....I was Never a fan of harlequin romance gal, but then again this is what i referred to as &#34;parent porn.&#34;
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!!!!  Don't waste your time seeing it in 2D.  You MUST see it in 3D!  It will BLOW your mind!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very good book. Slow read but I would definatly recommend. Not an adventure story but a story of courage, survival and the human ability to adapt.
B005IZLPME|5.0|I've seen this movie in both 2D and in 3D, and let me tell you something....  I think that EVERYONE should experience this movie in 3D.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|picked to access ouside wifi servers in public places without asking attendent.<br />doesn't work - password shown is gibberus no good
B001EN71HC|5.0|This is amazing!  The first two movies are among some of the funniest movies EVER!  But I can watch all of these and never get tired of them.  Yeah baby, yeah!
B008XJM6NY|4.0|Nice Box, well made, nice stick too!! Uno looks like between Ninrod and Dookie, old school Green Day.  Can't wait for listen Dos and Tre!
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|What can I say about this movie?  Have you seen the first Hangover movie?  If so, then you've already seen this movie.  But....it's still fun to watch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Honestly I hate romance novels but this one keeps you going. The ending keeps you wondering and I cannot wait to read the next!
0800141806|4.0|Very helpful to replace my old VHS tape that was a pain to use in class.  Good price point for a second hand DVD
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game , helps you pass a few free moments. Great for the kids too. Nice to have s clean game.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this is easily the best game on amazon marketplace as of this moment.<br />the puzzles are fun and just the right amount of difficulty to make you try them more than once the difficulty curve also progresses in a perfect sync with the game so almost no one will feel like the game is impossible.<br />also the flavor and humor are top notch.<br /><br />Atte:<br />the fan sign painter
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Very thought provoking like all of Picoult's books. This was the first book<br />of Jodi's rhat I read and now I am hooked on her!
B0099116AY|5.0|It was funny and well acted.  Even funnier when you are a couple the same age as the characters. I would recommend it to anyone
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|I saw the PBS show with Tony singing these duets with modern artists...well, the magic is on this CD as well....it's obvious that Tony Bennett is a living legend and these young singers are wowed by singing with a GIANT....LOVE it every time I listen!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I don't believe for a minute that Yoko or Macca need any more money. Ringo perhaps, as well as George as he lost a lot of money backing awful British films and giving millions away to the hare krishnas. Capitol/EMI, the recording corporation that cheated The Beatles of tens of millions of profits from their music, decided to bring out the tapes for yet one more wring around the old and rusty tape deck from the 1940s. What is particularly appalling is that with the BILLIONS of dollars The Beatles brought in to EMI, they were TOO CHEAP to buy them a 16 or 24 track recorder, and albums such as Sgt Pepper had to be recorded on 4 tracks. If The Beatles have any money today it was thanks to the combined efforts of Allen Klein, and their individual talents that kept on making records long after anyone else's well of inspiration had run dry. If there is any justice out there in the Cosmos, \\"Love Me Do\\" and songs from that period are now in the Public Domain (at least in Europe), so soon anyone in the world should be able to put out Beatle compilations on their own label. In another 6 or 7 years, SGT Pepper's and Abbey Road will be eligible to be on Publci domain. Crapitol/EMI has only a few more years to squeeze the profits from die hard beatles fans. \\"1\\" is the result of a republican capitalist pig opression of the workers.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie was very inspiring. As Michael Oher said &#34;he was going to make it even if he work at a gas station&#34; Amen
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is amazing and I love it so much it is inspirational and I hope I get to read more
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Wife loves her new kindle and the cover is just what she wanted to keep her new kindle safe. She loves the turn off feature when you close the case.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book series is amazing. I can't put it down and I can't stop telling all the women i know about it. It is definitely a must read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing story that captured my heart throughout the whole book.<br />And the price was good too. :o)
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|The biggest shame is that this movie flopped thereby robbing us of repeated visits to Mega City One. Simply put this is the best action film since The Raid and an essential purchase for any fan of action films.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|An entertaining book worth the time.  Again, Grisham weaves some legal insights into an enjoyable story.  A quick read typical of the author.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I needed some games that the entire family would enjoy that would get them OFF their phones..........well I still saw the tops of their heads this holiday as they were intent on these puzzles.  GET ALL OF THEM!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love little I spy games like this one has, and there is a slew of small quests daily. I think it can hold my interest a bit better than some games similar in design.
B005LAII8A|1.0|Gave this a one star. Bought it because Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were in it. The Acting is ok, but the story line lacks depth and is often times boring.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Anything written by DeMille is going to be great, and he proves it once again !!<br />I recommend it highly.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of the best shows (if not, the best), on TV today.  I think of the entire cast of characters as family because they work sooo well together.  The story lines are never boring, each character has his or hers own little quirks (which absolutely works) for each of them.  Exceptional and personable actors!! Cudos to superb writers, directors, producers and everyone involved in the production of this entertaining show.  Please, keep up the stupendus work!!
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Loved the movie. And it well be a long time hit. Like Frosty The Snow Man, Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Super fun. I got a rainbow dragon and I'm happy about that. It's fun for all ages and no adult supervision is needed:)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book takes you on such a journey. You will laugh the characters, cry (BAWL) with them, and find hope with them. It is so well written; I never felt like anything dragged on or was left unresolved. Colleen Hoover has taken a very heavy and serious subject matter and explored it with emotion and depth. This book stayed with me long after I finished.
B009K0P10K|5.0|One of the best shows on television!  I am addicted!!  The writting is unbelievable and each season gets better and better!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really kept my interest. Couldn't wait to get back to it whenever I had to stop. Well worth the money.
B00479SVBU|1.0|I started out loving this thing. Very convenient. Plus it has the best sound quaility out of any of these devices I've used. Unfortunately its a poorly made piece of junk. I've had it 5 months and its almost useless. I'll give it another month and I bet it quits altogether.<br /><br />NOTE: It doesn't play the songs in order. It seems to play them in the order they were copied onto whatever source is used.<br /><br />Here is my experience with this device:<br />The first week I got a black line on the screen. A month later the remote stopped working. Then it fell apart when pulling it out of the cigarette lighter (No I was not rough with it). I was able to get it back together, but this is when I really noticed it was put together poorly. Another month goes by and now you can't touch it while its on or it causes it to cut off and go static, then reloads the source. As of a few days ago, it no longer picks up on the song you were on when you turn the car on. Instead it goes back to the first folder on the source causing you to skip to the desired folder.<br /><br />So, to summarise, DON'T BOTHER!
1451688091|5.0|I thought it easy to read,while giving so much historical information..The author adds lots of personal history,as well.I would suggest reading the book,then see the movie..
B0001GNJQ0|1.0|I guess I was susposed to know that the dvd I was ordering from the United States would only play in the UK.  Took a long time to get the dvd and when I got it, it would not play in my dvd player.  Came to find out that it was a code 2 (UK) and I needed a code 1 to play in the (US).  They offered to take it back and would refund the cost of the dvd but not the shipping.  Well, it cost more to ship it back than I paid for the dvd, plus the shipping I already paid for once already.  Needless to say I have a dvd that I can't play.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Wonderful book, took me about 3 days to finish. WICKED kind of reminds me of Aperture Laboratories and Black Mesa.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|First time read of this author. Very well written book! I think anyone who owns a dog must read this!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Not a real good showing of Kings talent, far fetched and silly.I was really expecting more than a Grimms Fairy tale on Crack. I am one of Stephen Kings Biggest fans, I have almost every book hes written.
0517053616|5.0|What can you really say... other than perfect! Honestly this was quality printed works and its holding up through both of my children's high school
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book held my attention, I just couldnt put it down, its really not a usual King writting, so exact in the whole premise of the theory of time travel and what its effects could be, especially on such an infamous Day that not many will forget.<br />My kings library does not have this book.,but luckily I got a Kindle for Xmas.
0142403873|5.0|My kids love this book as much as they love the dvd.  The rhymes are great, the illustrations are great and the story is wonderful. Big hit with my three year old and 21-month-old.
B006MPK9SU|5.0|An amazing book which keeps me at the edge of my seat. A great book which had me guessing all the way through
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I was never able to download this game on my kindle. Hence, I never got to enjoy it. HELP! Please. I would love to play it.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I bought this combo pack because I wanted easy access to one of the special features available with the release of this film:  The documentary on all the Batmobiles ever made.  By \\"easy access\\" I mean \\"on the DVD, which I can play in my desktop or laptop computers without having to power up my home theater.  So, imagine my dismay when I discovered that the DVD that comes in this combo pack only had one extra on it:  A \\"history of Bruce Wayne\\" short that consists of people like Christopher Nolan talking about the character while a slide show of images from the films plays on screen.  That's it.<br /><br />I am giving this product a negative review for a variation on the concept of \\"false advertising\\".  Why sell a combo pack in which the DVD contains much less material than the Blu-ray.... and not label the product as being so constructed?<br /><br />Amazon's product description should have pointed this out up front.<br /><br />There maybe be a review or two that mention this discrepancy, but I should not have to look through reviews to learn what's on the DVD vs what's on the Blu-ray in the same combo pack product.<br /><br />Shame on the people who designed this product!
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Puts you right in her mind.  I can't imagine what people lived through then.  Gives you an unbelievable picture of what life was like.  This book includes pieces the original did not.  Worth the read!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|After reading the reviews I purchased the Pro version and have used it for a month on my Kindle Fire HD.  This is a really useful app with no bugs or useless frills.  I especially like the charge graphing function that enables me to extrapolate when charging will be complete, and to learn how quickly various uses of the tablet consume energy.  Highly recommended!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am a long time lover Gresham and this book was no exception to his talented writing.<br />I love suspense and it had plenty
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Any dog lover out there knows what it is like to lose a pet, but to mix that theme with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein makes this a fun movie with plenty of surprises.<br /><br />Fantastic art and clever animated scenes makes this movie one of my animated favorites.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Was captured by this series and cannot wait for more! Love the world and how much she captures each person
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Twice now I have lost access to the app. The first post Jelly Bean Upgrade when there was a probkem with the amazon app and tge second on an 8.5 hour flight with no internet access. Very frustrating<br />and i have a deep concern for all Amazon Purchased apps. One big server/network issue and i cannot use apps that i may depend on. In this case i had the defaukt calender, but other apps are more unique. Amazon rethink your system ir at least build in a period of time for those who maybe without internet access or when your app does not work well with a new version of the OS.
B008OW1S3O|4.0|I first heard Tessellate on the radio and loved the beat.  I was pleased to see that Amazon was selling the cd reasonably priced.  I popped it in the gameroom cd player for my husband to hear.  It took him a couple times through but Alt-J is his new favorite.
B00846REIS|3.0|I enjoyed this book. Having read 50 Shades, I found the plot line very similar and repetitious so it got a little old. That being said, I think the hot and heavy scenes were more interesting than 50 Shades. Overall, it was a nice, light read. I would recommend it.
B00596WEVI|5.0|Good purchase
B0094BB4TW|4.0|its a fantastic app but it crashes often. also the messaging part is good but actual messenger is so much better
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these ear phones for years for short and long distant  running. The sound is good and although not waterproof they are ideal for me because  they fit around the top of my head and the ear pieces stay firmly in my ears.  These ear phones are very inexpensive thus I treat them as an expendable item and normaly order more than 1 earphone at a time. I have had the current set for over 6 months without replacing. Obviously if it is raining or extremely humid I do not wear them
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love the whole entire trilogy but have to say this was in my favorite!! Its a definite one to read!
B006MOW98E|3.0|Let it Snow is one of those books that are complied by three authors into one single story. Though they all get their own sections. Meaning, three mini stories within the same situation that's suppose to all tie in together. Whew, that sounds tough! But these three authors did a wonderful job of weaving it all together! That's for sure. It all starts when a train breaks down in a small town a little ways away from a place called Waffle House. From there, all sorts of crazy things and feelings and adventures ensue!<br /><br />The first story up is The Jubilee Express by Maureen Johnson (yes they get titles too, awesome right?) and it's about a girl named Jubilee whos parents are thrown in jail for some really really silly. Because of this she's sent to spend Christmas with her grandma in Florida. Away from home and away from her long term boyfriend. On the train, she lends her phone to a boy named Jeb who's trying to contact his is/was girlfriend and though this may be a little insignificant at the time, I assure you, it isn't. She meets Stuart who has a really sincere heart and invites her to stay with him while the train is being fixed and who has a really really creepy mom. I mean, I thought this was going to be some Hansel and Gretel s*** and his mom was going to fatten Jubilee up and eat her for dinner. Then I thought Maureen wouldn't do that in a Christmas novel.... would she?! So yes, the whole time I was expecting it. Because you never know what Maureen has up her sleeve! Anyway, Stuart opens her eyes to her current romance situation and I was right there with him! Jubilee deserved a bit more than what she got!<br /><br />The second story A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle by John Green was cute. But that situation that these three friends (Tobin, JP and Angie aka Duke) was a little frustrating. One of their friends work at the Waffle House and demanded they come by (while it's snow storming out) to hang with him and make out with cheerleaders (where do guys get these ideas from?) so they go and Duke really isn't into the idea of it all (and I agree) but goes anyway since they promised her hash browns (I'd go too for some hash browns...). But on the way there, and trust me, it's a long way... things between Tobin and Duke start to revel itself. I don't see how Tobin could be so blind, but then again when you're friends with someone for that long... I guess it's not that hard.<br /><br />The last story The Patron Saint of Pigs by Lauren Myracle is going back to Jeb but based on his is/was girlfriend Addie. They were together for awhile and Jeb wasn't who Addie wanted him to be (very PDA and gift giving and all that other you-have-to-show-the-world-you-love-me stuff) so they had some sort of miscommunication and Jeb needed some time to think or something... I don't really remember it all lol but Addie was getting really worried about how people kept saying, \\"it's not all about you\\" basically telling her she's self absorbed and selfish without actually saying it. But in the little snippet that we saw her in... well she was pretty self absorbed and only cared about her own problems and had a big thing for letting people down. Also, the way she treated Jeb because he wasn't how he wanted her to be was crap! Total crap! And this is where the story wraps up.<br /><br />If I had to pick a favorite I would say it would be the first one. Maureen's quirky sense of humor really shows in Jubilee and I read through it giggling really fast. Overall, this is a really entertaining book to get you in the holiday spirit!<br /><br />Also, I remember Maureen talking about this when I met her and Stephanie Perkins for a signing in Oakland late last year and how they were writing it and they kept throwing weird things in it like the cheerleaders and blizzards and pigs to make it harder on the next writer lol.m?) so they go and Duke really isn't into the idea of it all (and I agree) but goes anyway since they promised her hash browns (I'd go too for some hash browns...).

B0018QQQK8|5.0|such a great book, Nicholas Sparks never lets you down... only unfortunate thing is the movie doesn't do it for me.. book was so much better!!
B0042J6VUS|2.0|If you use an iPhone 4S, I'm sure it'll fall apart sooner or later. It's fine because I just put a case on my phone and it fits really snugly, but the spring broke even though I was really careful and I put the raw phone with nothing on it. Buy it if you're very low on budget.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a must have.  I use this to easily stay aware of news and read interesting artcles.  The magazine format and navigation are top notch.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|This movie had many funny parts but we also found it sad. After recently losing our dog it hit a nerve and was hard to watch being reminded of our loss. Overall it was pretty good but for those who are sensitive (or children who have recently lost a pet) I would say pass.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Very interesting read. You can indeed control your thoughts and behavior by following the guideline in this book, but you do have to work at it to get results.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The best Grisham book I have read in quite a while.  I found myself thinking about some of the surprises in the book for many days after I had finished it.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I loved Morning Glory.  Was this movie bouncy and overly enthusiastic?  Absolutly!  It also explored the depths of Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford. It does bring up ruminations for those of us over 50.  There were so many issues exposed here, questions answered about what is really important, as well as inspiration for us older folks who are totally dedicated to exploring their passions in ilfe!  Lighthearted and very meaningful ... a must watch!
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I just felt the entire book was dark and depressing.  Of course, I hated the ending.  Now I can no longer look forward to the next Harry Hole book.
0810988232|5.0|Great inspirational cards by Wendy Froud. I wanted to purchase something special for my daughter. I had it delivered as a surprise to her address and she not only was surprised but loves the cards and use them as a guidance when things get a little unbalanced in her life.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I really love this movie<br />the most important reason is that I come from Belgium and in Belgium they don't have this blu ray version with the extras<br /><br />So thank you very much Amazon !!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|If your going to buy movies off amazon.com, buy them directly from Amazon because they deliver on time sometimes before the expected date. Besides there are so many scams on amazon.com that it's hard to know who to trust. I've been ripped off a couple of times when I bought things for just a dollar then never received the package.<br /><br />I already have the DVD version, but I really wanted the Joker edition. Honestly, this Blu-ray disc didn't disappoint me; and it won't let you down either.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|My son is a Lego fanatic, and also loves minecraft, so I was very excited to order this item. I was very disapointed when I saw it, I know it is a mini set, but really $150.00 ?!! My son had it built within a half hour, the design was just too simple, no challenge at all. I hope it will be a collector's item one day, and be able to sell it for at least $150.00
B004J4WNL2|4.0|An easy read and explans a lot about why I think and act like I do. It is hard to pretend when you have to play nice.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Not a genious literal read but pretty entertaining nontheless.  Now reading &#34;50 shades darker&#34; and next in the trilogy after that.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Not only does the movie highlight some funny scenes but it is an 80's film lover memorial collection with the references and songs.  Who wouldn't love a film that features reminders of what made John Hughes movies great.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son loves the original and new version. So I believe that kids and friends should have the same time with both versions and have a special place in their lives and enjoy the fun and laughter of both versions and have the same time with both versions of the game. So have fun and enjoy the game.
B008133MDK|5.0|Okay, the first season was awesome and a great way to update a classic but this gets better and more amazing with each episodes and ends with a Watson moment that is well I don't want to give it away.  But, it will stick with you.  I love the relationship between these two men and some of the new characters.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Some awesome stuff in hero's of Olympus and the lost hero<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one of the hero's of Olympus series.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Some fathers and daughters are great and others take work.  Some share so many things like their passions in common but struggle to get there and this film is great.  It expressing the love, the struggle, the heart and challenges of families.  Worth the rental.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I did not see this film in the theater. But after renting the blu-ray, I have to say I really enjoyed this visual stunner of a film. Maybe this first Aliens prequel installment is more teaser than anything but as a sci-fi buff, I liked the &#34;old school&#34; SF feel of this film. Get in a space ship, travel to a mysterious planet and chase a dream and then find out the reality is so much more than you thought. Cast and effects were fantastic. I recently purchased a 3D TV and this movie was one of the first 3D films that I purchased to test my new setup. SImply AMAZING in 3D. Looking forward to the sequel whenever Ridley Scott decides to do it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|what am i going to do while i wait for the next book.  and please stop killing my favorite characters. going to be very lonely without the starks in my dreams at night
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Okay, at 84% I felt I might give this one star. I was so tired of the fighting and mens' war that I wanted to throw the book. There are females in the book but most are arm candy or worse. There is one evil woman and then possibly three good females but they exist in this macho world and are mostly boring because of it. Arya and Dany are my favorites.<br /><br />At best I can only give this book three stars and it only got there because I liked the ending. Otherwise, with it costing more than four regular books because I had to buy the Audible version, it was costly even when I was able to find another version to read on my Kindle. The idea that they don't even have text-to-speech ought to get them sued for not making it available to the handicapped! And if I had that heavy tree book I would throw it at whoever thought I shouldn't be able to loan it to whomever I choose!<br /><br />But the writing is good and the story kept my interest, most of the time. I do like that the story is told through different characters to keep it from being stale. But even if I could give all the stars I would only give four or four and a half. It is just too testosterone driven.<br /><br />Oh, I guess I should add a bit for the narrator. He was good, although I did feel like one other reviewers I read somewhere: I felt I was hearing leprechauns and pirates a lot of the time. But that was okay as it did vary the voices for the characters. Otherwise it might have been very boring.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|i haven't enjoyed reading a series as much since the lord of the rings trilogy years ago. the only thing is it is going to be killer waiting for the last 2 books to be published.  If you are watching the series on tv, the books aren't as pornographic as the mini series.  I miss the characters already
0765325950|5.0|I find it laughable that the extremely verbose \\"reviews\\" posted here were mostly done in the 48 hours after the release of the book.  Only skimmers could possibly read this book and write long-winded reviews in that short timeframe.  And why would anyone who has read (and devoted many years) to reading the 13 novels of this story care?  Why would anyone read reviews here in order to make a decision on whether or not they would read the conclusion of this epic story?  I loved it, and I am quite certain anyone who is a fan of the story will love it too.  In a word of Thom Merrilin, \\"exquisite.\\"
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great story with a new twist. It kept us on the edge of our seats. Can't wait for the episode, although now we must wait for the new episodes on tv. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|She's perfect for my daughter to carry in her back pack or have a fun little partner in bed.  My daughter goes to private school, so the plaid works great too!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|But it's a little grusome and not everyone can handle blood and guts like me!  A fantastic show, though!!! So addicting!!!
B00APUQH0W|1.0|It may be ok for others to hear Clint Eastwood use the Lord's name in vain, but it wasn't ok with us (only 10 minutes or so into the movie.) Why do they 'bleep' use of words such as s..t to describe human excrement, but think nothing of using the Lord's name in vain. We may not be in the mainstream, but this movie should have been rated R. Sure spoiled it for us, wish we could get our money back.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Couldn't stop watching, and I loved that the episodes don't always end with cliff hangers, just the end of the most crazy thing they're in the middle of!
0765325950|5.0|I have been reading and rereading this series for years.  Hard to believe that the end has finally supposedly come.  Best fantasy series behind Tolkien in my opinion.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This is one of the best Disney movies! It is destined to be a classic! The movie has a great story and take on the story of Rapunzel and the songs are perfect as well.
0553582453|5.0|I enjoy good fantasy, and Robin Hobb writes good fantasy.  I have enjoyed this series and the others as well.  I would say the Live Ship series is the weakest.
B006YC74E8|3.0|Great for basic cropping and editing. To add an image to an existing photo does not work. Very basic program!
B003AVMURM|5.0|I can's say enough about Brio train systems. Quality craftsmanship like this is hard to find and our 4 year old grandson loves to build with them. Great problem solving toy.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I love the concept and this app is very easy to use, but the photos come out very grainy. I use when I really want a photo of something and don't have my real camera with me.
B003AVMUR2|5.0|Quality craftsmanship is hard to find. the hard wood will hold up to lots of use and the versatile flip side allows it to connect in either direction. Our 4 yr. old grandson is problem solving as he builds.

B0025VLEM0|5.0|This is a funny movie!  My husband and I love to laugh, and this parody is great!  We like Simon Pegg, and watch his movies often!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this first at 12 and it has been one of my favourite books ever since. Jonas lives with his parents and sister in a society where everything is strictly ordered. It's safe and everyone knows what to do and how to act in any thinkable situation. The society runs like clockwork. Jonas is turning 12 soon. For the children, every year is marked with a Ceremony. At the Ceremony the transition is marked with new clothes, a bike, new duties etc. for each age group. The Twelves are given their assignment - their job for the rest of their adult life.<br /><br />Jonas' Assignment is a shock to him and to the Community. But he soon learns to cope with it - and with a dangerous new world of feelings, memories, lost freedoms and the consequences of brutal equality. The story follows him through most of his twelfth year, where Jonas' thoughts of his home drastically changes. He grows up fast - and then has to make a choice for himself and for the Community.
B007N31Z06|5.0|This has been one of our favorite movies for years!  We were so glad it came out on Blu-ray and love having it on two discs so we can watch it in different rooms.
0300169787|5.0|The cover of the book is enough to say WOW! Photo's are eye catching and great to look at. I bought this book for my sister in law and now I'm ordering one for myself!
B005LAIH9K|2.0|My husband and I love the first three movies and we own them all on DVD and Blu-ray.  We were disappointed that this last one was not nearly as good, and we were sorry that we bought it.  They could've done without the babysitter part of the story line: it was too predictable and carried on for too long.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I use Avast on my notenook/ laptop  and found it to be effective and reliable so I was glad to see that I could install it on my HD Fire.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|My husband and I love the quickness of this movie, it moves along and keeps us interested.  And the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is great!  We agree this movie was well written and well acted. :)
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This was a great book until the ending. The ending was horrible..it ruined the whole book for me. Very disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Looking forward to the next season. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The case is very nice, but the rotate feature a little hard to use. Its very tight. Maybe as I use it it may become easier to rotate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I love how they have daily challenges and you get a certain amount of coins that raises every day!!

B006LSZECO|4.0|It started out a bit slow and confused me.Once I got through a few chapters I got really into it.Only half through it but am looking forward to finishing it as it is all drama now and great reading.
1451696191|5.0|I saw the movie and fell in love and was dying to read the book, and it didn't disappoint - neither did the fast shipping and delivery and quality!! brand new!!!!!
B007REV4YI|3.0|I have to agree with the comment that Dalton may have been the most underrated Bond ever. Much darker and closer to Flemming's agent. Casino Royale was interesting and Craig was brilliant but the two obvious flaws, (The steering wheel on the wrong side of the car and that Bond played Baccarat, not poker) were obvious and laughable. When comparing Craig, Connery, Lazenby and Dalton, it's hard to pick the best. (Moore and Brosnon were just silly). Craig, Dalton and Connery are obviously the best actors of the bunch but in Skyfall, Craig does his best with an incredibly hard to believe script. I especially am sorry they had to kill off Judi Dench. She brought a whole new flavor to the series.<br /><br />Despite the incredible poor reviews of \\"Quantum of Solace\\" I have to say it holds up to multiple viewings better than Skyfall.<br /><br />Speaking for many Bond fans, we can only hope that next time Craig gets a more believable script.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Couldn't make it through the entire film. Charlize is gorgeous. Some of the cinematography was beautiful and enchanting. Charachters weren't built. Kirsten was horrendous and flat. Would NOT recommend.
B008WOULPK|3.0|I love me some Grace Coddington, but this book could have used a better ghost writer to draw out more of what makes Grace so unusual and interesting. Even so, if you enjoy fashion, it's a fun glimpse behind the scenes at Vogue.

0765325950|5.0|I per-ordered my book and received it on the day it came out.  A Memory of Light had me sitting on the edge of my chair the entire time.  This book had me crying, cheering, saying oh no! and feeling sad, all at the same time.  It took me 4 days to finished this book because I have children but any spare moments I had, I continued reading.  I finally finished at 2 a.m. in the morning and it was so worth it. My heart broke when I lost people I truly cared about and loved but others took up the banners of the fallen and keep going.  The story was so gripping that I felt like I was there on the field of battle. It was the perfect ending to an amazing story!!! Thank you Robert Jordan (for creating a wonderful story) and to Brandon Sanderson (for helping to end a beautiful series). A Memory Of Light inspired me to start the series again from the first book!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game isn't as bad as everyone wants to say. it's. a fun way to pass the time. gladbi downloaded it

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good solid app that makes me feel like I am using the real thing.  Easy to read buttons and good touch control.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|No complaints. All parts came accordingly... would recommend purchasing. Came with bullets and the bullet holders. Good product over all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There were subtle hints at twists, but they weren't always what was expected.  Pleasantly surprised and couldn't wait to read the next page.

0307730697|4.0|Fearless is a biography that enables us to get to know a caliber of person that some of us may never encounter in our actual lives. Adam Brown not only became a Navy Seal but he also was able to succeed after falling into a drug as addictive as crack.<br /><br />Brown dying in battle is sad but it reflects his character. He didn't only go into battles that guaranteed him success. Brown died testing his talent to the limit. Ultimately, going out during the midst of a fight is how the real heroes make an exit. People like Adam aren't the type of people to end up in nursing homes telling stories of their past.<br /><br />A book as good as this makes you not want to move onto the next book in your queue. I feel as if I have to make some sort of impact with what I've learned from this story before I can move on. I recommend the book because it'll likely produce a similar effect for many readers.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Minecraft is one of his favorite games.....he loves the creative aspect of it. And one of his favorite toys is Legos. We were both thrilled when Lego started offering this set. We plan to buy several so he can continue to build and expand his world.

B000N2HBSO|1.0|It did not download to my Kindle. So I never got to read it. I will not try again and probably will scrap the Kindle.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|awesome!!!! I love it and its a fun timewaster! it is so cute and fun for all ages;, but I would watch little kids because they might spend money on credits without you knowing.... other than that pretty cool!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This movie was much better than I expected, great ensemble cast and the music was awesome! Definitely considering purchasing the soundtrack.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book! It just draws you in and you just can't put it down. I can't wait to start on the next one!!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This is a very good book, but very long.  It's a very interesting perspective on history, but it seemed to never end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book...read it in 1 day, then ordered the next one, read that in 2 days, then now I'm on the 3rd one. If you want sexy, romantic, confusing, ups and downs book reading...this was so fun to read.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|This is a very fun game as long as you don't play against my sister... she wins everytime!  It's a perfect addition to my kindle fire when I need a break from my book.
0307744434|1.0|I read \\"The Night Circus\\" onboard a cruise ship when the weather was too harsh to put into port.  I wanted to throw myself overboard after having invested in this black/white/silver (and a minimum of red) nightmare.  Ringling Brothers' Circus has nothing to worry about, nor does any incarnation of Cirque du Soleil.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My mom introduced me to this game and now I can't get enough of it!  I could play for hours if I didn't limit myself!

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great introduction to an exciting new character. I look forward to reading more of his books. Hopefully the first of many.
B00ADYYY50|1.0|Just because you come off as a stoner doesent make you a good rapper or even original. Pothead rappers, thats SOOO NEW.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|several friends recommended this for my kindle and phone and computer. They all link smoothly.<br />the suggested readings work well.  I just followed fasting study, and it worked well with reminders and goodnotes and suggested passages to read.nnotes are easy yo write and share. it's nice you can get many versions, even in French and other languages. The biggest drawback is they don't offer any commentaries or Bible dictionaries or original languages, or parallel comparison; you must find other programs or apps for that. if you need that use my sowrd or olive tree, otherwise youversion is good. PTL!
B008602KQI|4.0|Ordered early for a Christmas gift for my grandson....it arrived on time, and Christmas was a success. Always good to order early.

B000PGHVC4|5.0|The book Rebecca is a classic and needs no review. This review is for the used book company, Book Hounds, that sold this first edition volume of Rebecca. The company, Book Hounds, a seller of used books through Amazon, even wrapped the book for giving as a gift without being asked. The book came on time, in exactly its described condition. I completely recommend this seller for hardbound, collector type book buying through your Amazon account.

B00A0HQ9GM|4.0|Amazing vocal range with haunting melodies turned me on to this CD.  Some of the hip hop overtones can get annoying, especially the constant sampling of a guy screaming.  Sometimes it doesn't fit the song.  I find her live acoustic type shows more genuine.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm so glad I decided to read this book before watching the  movie ! Completely satisfied with it . Best book
145162607X|3.0|I was unable to get into this book emotionally. The young Anne in the first part of the book is annoyingly self-centered and vapid, and doesn't really improve as she ages.  I also thought there would be an early backstory for her and Richard, but there seems to be no close connection. Prior to their marriage Anne just sees him as a means to escape from her sister and George.  Anne's main goal throughout the book appears to be fulfilling her father's wish that she (or her sister) becomes Queen, regardless of which prince or House they use to get there.  Only a couple of chapters at the end of the book deal with her illness, which until the very end she is sure was brought on by Elizabeth Woodville's witchcraft. I felt no sense of loss with Anne's death; more a sense of relief. The book ends there, so I suppose another book will have to deal with Richard's death at Bosworth Field. One part of the book that I did find interesting was regarding George of Clarence, and that his supposed death in a butt of wine was of his choosing to mock Queen Elizabeth. For those who are Ricardians, you won't find anything new here. If you are interested in a more emotional (and much better) treatment of Richard III, you can't beat Sharon Kay Penman's \\"The Sunne in Splendour.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Reminiscent of the old carnival/fair game. Very enjoyable and easy to play.  I can leave my Kindle Fire plugged in and keep the app on to reload my coins, just need to check back every several minutes :)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Such a relevant book and so practical with great examples of how other people have learned. We've already recommended it to other people, and are relating it to our kids. I can't recommend it highly enough!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like the challenge of hidden object games and this is one of the best ..... there seems to be no end in sight and the objects change frequently so you do &quot;learn&quot; where to find them!
0765325950|4.0|A good ending to a very long series.  I wish the whole Padan Fain story line had been fleshed out more though and I wish that the very end could have been a little different.  At least with how his wives would carry on.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A lot of Clancy's readers really like the \\"Jack Ryan\\" series of novels with their vivid characters such as John Clark, \\"Ding\\" Dominguez, and of course Jack Ryan Sr. and Jr.  So we were disappointed when several books of this \\"series\\" (term loosely applied) were bloated and not that interesting or plausible.  The first novel that Clancy co-authored with Greaney, \\"Locked On\\" was pretty good, but imperfect in a number of ways that \\"Threat Vector\\" seems to correct. This novel, \\"Threat Vector\\" approaches Clancy's very best novels -- I will go out on a limb and say that Mark Greaney seems to be serving as something that Clancy desperately needed -- an editor.  This novel is fairly tightly written, not bloated, and has an excellent storyline that hold the reader's interest throughout.  Just like the early \\"Tom Clancy\\" novels of old, e.g. Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Patriot Games, and others.  This one reads similarly and is in fact a ripping read in its own right.  Others have said that Mr. Greaney did the bulk of the writing (don't ask me if this is true), but if this is so he has successfully preserved much or most of the best parts of Clancy's writing -- the skillful integration of high technology into a suspenseful plot involving geopolitics and conflict.<br /><br />The theme of this novel is a low-intensity conflict between the US and an aggressive Communist China.  The story is plausible and disturbing, and gives a fascinating and insightful look at cyber-warfare and America's vulnerability to attacks of this kind.  As the authors say, America has never been good at preparing for new forms of warfare, and she is likely very vulnerable to an aggressive cyber-assault from China or others.  The authors carry off the story with elan and alacrity, managing to acquaint the reader with some of the intricacies of cyber-warfare without crossing the line and becoming bogged down.  Further, in this novel the characterizations are very good and one wonders what will happen as between Jack Ryan Jr. and Melanie Kraft (no spoilers here.)<br /><br />\\"Threat Vector\\" ends on a satisfactory note but nevertheless leaves an opening for a follow-on novel that I hope we will see.  Recommended.  RJB.happen as between Jack Ryan Jr. and Melanie Kraft (no spoilers here.)<br /><br />\\"Threat Vector\\" ends on a satisfactory note but nevertheless leaves an opening for a follow-on novel that I hope we will see.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|So  the first few chapters have me curious enough to keep reading.  Good character and story development so far but only on chapter three, so a full review is not yet possible.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Very good movie. They managed to pull it off again, just as entertaining as #1 & 2. Not too keen on current movie &#34;music videos&#34; just replaying a bunch of scenes out of the movie. But I guess everyone is cutting corners these days to save a buck.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|So nice of someone gave Batman a happy ending. Special effects were great. Still don't understand why Blu-ray movies have to have all the other media discs included so they can justify charging more.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|This was the most reasonable price I have found on Amazon. It was to expensive on other websites. I really like this case. It really is a good case especially if you drop your phones alot like I do. The case protects your phone from damage and I love it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am stingy with my stars. 1-star = couldn't finish it and am still holding my nose (as in \\"Warning! Warning! Will Smith); 2 stars = read it if you are marooned on an island and are running out of reading material ; 3 stars = worth your time and money, but not to rave about; 4-stars = well worth your time and money, and clearly recommended; 5-stars = a book that should not be bypassed for the price and highly recommended. Frankly, it don't go out of my way to review, doing it maybe 20% of the time.<br />I think this is about the 3rd 5-star rating from me. Other reviews tell enough about the story, and I too am generally not impressed by your typical 'log book' tale. This is the exception! It has a tale told by a competent, with humor and humility. It holds your attention and smacks of being really possible if not likely. Read it!
B008BM9L72|3.0|Books are readable but only ok.  Skipped a lot as story line was weak.  Did not live up to all the hype.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|My Mom needed a nice gift for my Dad and didn't have time to get out to the store to buy it, so she asked if I could order it on Amazon.  Not only did we get a great buy, but a great value in product.  My Dad loves Harry Potter and we all enjoyed watching it with him!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The disc was perfect, the case was perfect, and it arrived just before Christmas.  Good service and good product equals one happy customer.  Thanks!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Was the to put down. I didn't want it to end
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This is a book that every manager should read.  Most of the philosphy of this book I embrace.  The support data is very compelling and easily used as a tool not only in the corporate world but in everyday life!
B000BNX4MC|3.0|Classic movie, typical teenagers. Bought this for my bf, he loves it. It fun, cliches now. what more can i say.
0142421375|5.0|I read this book some time ago, at the time not realizing it was written for a very young audience. I purchased this book for my grandson (age 12) to encourage him to read as he talks at times of wanting to become an attorney. Theodore Boone is the son of parent attorneys who sets up his &#34;office&#34; in a supply closet of his parents' legal firm, and approaches tangled lega problems of his young peers (gratis, of course). It's fun to read.
6305609721|4.0|I believe the dvd skipped a few times. Enjoyed the movie, the acting was a little funny, dated. Fun, light hearted action movie.
B0083QK14I|5.0|The Theodore Boon series hopefully will get young people to abandon their electronic games in pursuit of the pleasure of reading.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Didn't enjoy nearly as much as the first one.  Biggest problem, however, was that pages were missing from the ebook version.  The first pages of each chapter were just not there. Very annoying.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Rule number one for me:  I don't watch movies more than once...  Simply cannot do it...  Until Pitch Perfect!  Watched it 13 times!!!  Loved it!  This soundtrack is greeeeeeeat!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The kindle version of this app stinks. I was looking forward to playing it because it has a bigger screen than my iPod Touch, and I cold therefore make better drawings, which is absolutely true. BUT a lot of the features are gone on this version. It doesn't allow you to use bombs to buy words worth more coins, and if you're playing with someone who has that feature and they use their bombs for more coins, they are lost for not only you, but the person who bought them! Very annoying! And I discovered that it also doesn't allow for &#34;badges.&#34; All the badge points that I worked for all disappeared the minute I booted up this app. GONE. All of them. I have to start over again. What a pain. I had to delete this app and quit using it.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this for my step grand daughter, who loves &#34;One Direction&#34;. She recieved another one also, but she says it is a great CD.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works just the way it's supposed to. Takes a little getting used to because it's not exactly like my iPod or the Web page, but it's great.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I`m an old lady Kid Rock fan! lol I pre-ordered this before it`s release. I was so excited to recieve it! I love it as much as I have loved his last 2 CDs. I bought another one for my sewing room and one for each of my 3 sons. I have a decal on the back of my SUV that says &#34;Got Kid Rock?&#34; I get comments on it all the time, it`s a stark contrast to my &#34;Quilter Grandma&#34; license plate holder!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app! Tells me how long I can use any part of my kindle fire he so I don't have to wonder if it will die in the middle of a movie, book or shopping for hours on Amazon.  Takes the guess work out of battery life. Thank you!
B006QPX6IG|5.0|This movie is one of the best from a historical perspective.  I loved Jeff Daniels. Could have done better with the beards.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Save your money - they live unhappily ever after.<br /><br />I don' t believe the ending - one of these psychos is going to kill the other.  Why didn't the author go ahead and wrap it up for us?  No way they are going to live together until they are 90 years old.<br /><br />Won't waste any more money on this author.
B0053KWDES|5.0|This is my first portable headphone amp, so I don't have much to go on... However, this little unit delivered on every promise made by audio blog reviewers and the manufacturer.  In that respect, I'm more than pleased... The potentiometer is top-notch and the brushed silver sections are very durable.  The black plastic, on the other hand, is a little thin... and too smooth for my liking.  At $60, I won't be happy if this thing slips out of my hand and hits the ground... the battery hatch will most certainly crack open if such a thing were to happen.  A higher quality plastic with some texture would help boost the overall build quality to a full-blown 5 star rating.  In terms of sound, there are plenty of options... between 2 voltage settings, 2 gain settings, and 3 EQ settings, you have a lot more opportunity to tune the sound than I had initially expected.  This amp boosted some pretty humble cans to a whole new level.  I will be recommending it to friends.  PS - I'm still waiting for the iPod dock connector cable (L9) to arrive... I'm hoping that removing the onboard iPod amp from the equation will help improve the performance even more.
B000MQPKVG|5.0|I enjoy collecting old and excellent movies.  This movie is captivating and is more like reading a novel than watching a movie.  The score is beautiful; the cinematography is beautiful; the plot is intriguing; the acting is excellent.  No grand explosions, no CG, no car chases, no edge of your seat suspense but the story line keeps you entertained.  This is a rare movie that I will rewatch many times in the future.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I am a child at heart and I loved this movie..I am amazed by the animation, nice story line, and the ending made me cry......
0765325950|1.0|I haven't read one good word in this book. Of course its because of the choice of the publisher to not make it available to those of us that are not filling our shelves and landfills with dead trees.<br />I was ready to plop down my money to buy this, but the publisher decided not to release it in a modern form until far in the future. Now I guess Ill go to the library. I'm not protesting the Author, just those who are screwing up his legacy.
B000002GYN|4.0|This first albumn offered up by the Eagles, is sadly almost disregarded by some critics and the Eagles themselves.  However I grew to really like the Eagles with this music and even if they don't want to play Witchy Woman, I still like it and it may be why we didn't forget them altogether for their first attempt at the country rock they were playing at the time.  Of course Take it Easy kept them on the air waves through the lean years and Peaceful Easy Feeling also made us not forget where they came from.  I rate this music as high as any they have produced and will listen to it first when I go to their name in my record file.  This is the Eagles.  Good music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing book. I could not put it down. Takes you from one emotion to another so powerfully. Great characters and story line. Tragic events from the past, and an intense attraction...it just makes you loose yourself in their story.  I loved it.
B007KCG7MQ|3.0|I have and have purchased almost all of Joe Walsh's music from 1972 on and some before.  James Gang music and his contribution to the Eagles music has been pretty good.  I like this new CD albumn and my wife likes anything he does, so I will rate this as 3 stars.  I may come back and rate it higher in the future, as I readily have music grow on me and I sometimes like it more with time. There are a few really good cuts on this CD and overall it is worth listening to.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Enjoyable book, great action does not take long to get started and action lasts the entire book. Enjoyable novel to read.
B008M87GJK|5.0|it is an app for kindle. I use it to view news. it is an app for kindle. I use it to view news.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|wish it would have been longer, but it was a good game over all. and well worth the 2.99 I paid for it.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|I saw Pitch Perfect in theaters and knew I was going to purchase it when released on DVD. Side splitting comedy at every corner mixed with the talent of a Capella. Loved it!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|George was my favorite Beatle so I had to have this and I just love watching the footage of him. Great stories too. Sad though, his life was over too soon. This is for the die hard Beatle/Harrison fan.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Sent this DVD set to my parents in India, they love it. The show itself is a well written and beautifully made show depicting the ups and downs of early 20th Century UK aristocratic society.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|My band covers a song off their first album and I have come to love these guys. Great Southern Rock if you like your rock from the south. Don't know too much about the band though some friends have seen in them in concert and loved them. If you like Tucker, Skynyrd and the like, you'll like em'.
0307895475|5.0|Exactly what was expected and what was ordered.  Just what I wanted.  package was received quickly and package  efficiently. Thanks
B0063GORYU|4.0|I was playing this game on my base computer, so i was thrilled to find the app for my Kindle.  It takes away a lot of boredom when I have appointments, and busrides.  I switch back and forth between the game and my reading.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Good song picks and such a clear voice. Some songs are beautiful with susan and the orchestra. Very relaxing indeed.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am able to keep informed of family and friends.  I enjoy it immensely.  Photos are always such a great way to stay in touch, and Facebook enables all of us to share photos.
0525952926|5.0|This is one of my favorites - can't wait to read the 3rd book in the Century Trilogy. If you like Follett you will LOVE this book!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Could not put this book down ,  funny at times , me and my wife loved it . Don't miss out read it now !
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|Bought this for my young cousin - he is 6 and a big Angry Birds fan. He was not really able to figure out how to use it, though he really wanted to. Just another toy that will end up in a land fill...
B0026KZ412|5.0|Tom at his best and Renee are great together not too chick Flicky ! Just a lot of fun good for a Sunday afternoon movie
B008220C38|5.0|To say that this is a fresh adaptation is an understatement. It's not about shortcuts or whether it's loyal to the text; this is about a film that took a lot of guts to make. Shakespeare wrote: \\"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players...\\" Joe Wright explores this concept wonderfully within this film. It requires a serious amount of imagination. The world that has been created for this film doesn't hand you everything, you have to make some of it up on your own. Furthermore it definitely serves to show how fake everyone in the high social classes was at the time. The world is full of rich detail and, at the same time, you feel the imprisonment of the social norms people had to follow. The costumes are drop dead gorgeous and the score really sets the tone for the whole film. Keira Knightley did a credible job as Anna, displaying complexity and portraying a complete downward spiral. I believed her. However, I definitely think this isn't a movie for everyone considering it's creative concept for story telling.
B0016MZFXS|5.0|my son collects star wars and this is the cutest thing ever  the time on the ceiling is fun and his sounds for the alarm are great reminders of the movie
B007N0REX6|5.0|My husband saw a concert of Slash and Miles Kennedy on TV that he DVR'd and just kept watching over and over so I bought this CD for him as a Christmas gift.  He loves it.  It's good old fashioned butt kicking rock & roll!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great resource!  What I like about it is you can pick a plan of study - through the Bible in one-year; Joyce Meyers thought for the day and many other plans,and you can also set up reminders that will be sent to your email. I have downloaded it to my Kendal and to my iPhone.  You can take it with you wherever you go!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am 9 years old and minecraft is my favorite game.  It has my favorite objects and it is AWESOME!  You can build awesome stuff and go adventuring.  I can join with my brothers and we build houses together.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom did it again I was entranced in yet another masterpiece. Suggested read. He truly is an amazing writer.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|Troll Hunter presents a different perspective on the horror genre which I found to be both refreshing and very entertaining.  The performances (Swedish dialogue with English subtitles) were very convincing and the method was reminiscent of something like Jeff Corwin Experience or Ghosthunter.  Personally I thought the FX (i.e. CG trolls) was surprisingly good, in fact better than what I'm used to seeing in a lot of domestic horror.  What really hooked me was the creativity regarding the mythology (e.g. their aversion to devout Christians etc.) which fascinated me coupled with an element of suspense as more information about these legendary creatures was revealed and all within the Jaws-esque adventure/horror setting.<br /><br />Regarding the originality of this film I think V. A. Musetto of the New York Post nailed it when he said; \\"You'll want to catch this clever movie before Hollywood ruins everything with a dumb remake.\\"  :o)
B004QX07G4|3.0|It was kind of dumb.  Just a  bunch of rambling about nothing.  I almost quit reading it more than once.  On air she is funny when she talks as she does but it isn't as funny in writing.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|Came in the original packaging from Stanley, tightly cased in plastic.  When my son opened it one of the tripod legs was already broken.  I thought Stanley was a good name but this was very disappointing.
0714843377|1.0|This book was recommended to me, but I did not find it very useful. Extremely short (read it through in less than 1 hour) and quite old fashioned (yes, I know it's not new) I didn't read a single thing I didn't already know. I was a little disappointed as I had planned to relax and read during christmas and get inspired for the start of a new division of my company. Well, if you have no experience at all this book could be useful, the advice you get is all perfectly correct and true, and as I said, easy and short to read, if thats your worry!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book ended up being a no so guilty pleasure.  I could not stop reading it, wanting to find out what happens next.  While it was intense, it still made you think, and did a good job of exploring social and individual psychology, making the characters of the silo more real for me.  High art, maybe not, but nail biting, yes.  Worth a read for sci-fi or fiction fans.<br />Just do the omnibus.  You won't want to wait between installments.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|This album really set me in the mood for Christmas...it's full of traditional carols that I remember from my childhood and sung by Annie Lennox is just the cherry on the icing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just as fun as any other version I've ever played.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as well.  Can't beat free.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book!!! Can't wait for walking disaster!! Travis and Abby are beyond the best characters ever made! OMG!!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|any Doctor Who fan will enjoy the fifth season of the showbecause Matt smith bring new life to the Doctor.

B002C4YYEU|4.0|A good movie for when you are snowed in or a rainy day!  It's different.  For the price, you can't go wrong!  :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The best book I've ever read. Ever.  I couldn't put  it down, I loved this book from start to finish . I told everyone about it.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Not sure why I rented this in the first place, but this movie is horrible. The story just lacks everywhere and is just plain ridiculous.
1609611543|4.0|I want to have more time to spend with this book. Very informational. I am taking classes and don't have much time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Superb book - Clancy's story telling/writing style continues to be remarkable. All in all it was a fun read and kept my interest from the first page to the last. I highly recommend this book.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This cover works well and looks good.  It provides excellent protection for Kindle Fire.  The purple color fits my style.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It really comes down to Grisham's style for story telling - either you like it or you don't. My situation is the latter - I read the whole book and by comparison, if you like Clancy (as I do) you may not enjoy this book (which I didn't).
B000AADYRQ|1.0|I've heard of Death Cab for Cutie for years, had no preconceived idea of what to expect when I obtained a free (or maybe it was 99cents - I don't remember) download of Plans off Amazon, and went into it in more of a mellow mood these days, having just listened to and appreciated very much Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper.<br /><br />Having listened to the album and giving it a fair chance, I can unhestitatingly state that if Plans reflects accurately and broadly upon this band's abilities, style and overall musical quality, the only interesting thing about this alt-indie pop band is their rather affectation-laden name.<br /><br />Plans is the sort of album that one could have playing in the background repeatedly for hours and when asked about it, one readily could anticipate a response &#34;Oh, did you have music playing?  I didn't even notice.&#34;  It features songs that seem most distinguished by their lack of features and distinction.  The problem I had with this album's music is that it is essentially 100% rhythm, featuring no lead guitar, nor even lead bass or keyboard lines.  Piano takes more of a forefront than any other instrument, but the songs are crafted with the apparent intention of excessive politeness such that no instrument imposes on any other or dares to express itself in any outspoken fashion remotely representing a powerful line, solo, riff, etc....<br /><br />This brings up the second problem, namely, the lack of much of a tune or melody on any of these songs that might actually feature and take advantage of any of the distinctive characteristics of any of the band's instruments.  There is absolutely no passage of music on this entire album that features a hook - none of it reaches out and grabs the listener and says &#34;This is catchy&#34; or &#34;This is an interesting progression of notes or chords.&#34;  Drawing an analogy to jewelry-making, the songwriting on this album would be the equivalent of necklace after necklace that features small,round, nearly identical sized beads in several varying shades of gray or charcoal.  For instance, on What Sarah Said, we have a very simple, repetitive playing of piano scales - 1-2, 2-3, 2-3, 1-2 - Lah LAH, LAH Lah over and over for 6 plus minutes. The drumming is routine, simple, and uninteresting. Instead of much of a tune or melody, we have what another reviewer excitedly described as: &#34;changes in volume level caused by instruments entering and exiting.&#34; The bulk of the other songs are the same, with the only relief from the pablum being something approaching a guitar crescendo on the end of &#34;Someday You Will Be Loved.&#34; The monotony of these songs is almost akin to a 4-minute version of a bad radio ad jingle, possessing something that resembles and grasps at, but does not actually achieve, a tune.<br /><br />The third problem I had with the album is that it features singing that complements the instruments, rather high-pitched, but soft, understated, male vocals that were not inharmonious, but lacked any pretense of passion, excitement, or enthusiasm. After finishing the album, I wanted to grab the singer by the collar, shake him, and yell, &#34;Damn it man!  Express something!&#34;  Singing is by far the least important part of music for me, but it should at least convey something, not this dull, pleasant, near-sotto voce droning.<br /><br />Before writing this review, I read several others here, including one that suggested that this is perhaps the rock album of the year for the year in which it was released.  I was astonished.  Plans is not any sort of a rock album. The best you could say of it is that it is vaguely pleasant-sounding alt-pop. To claim that it is &#34;quite possibly the best rock album of 2005&#34; would be analogous to saying that Paris Hilton is &#34;quite possibly the most talented entertainer of our time.&#34; Rock is a broad genre, but needs to incorporate either energy or an edge to the music. Plans has neither. Rock is not broad enough to encompass understated, excessively politely sung lyrics accompanying nothing more than a rhythm section, with chorus sections distinguished not by being a focal point of the song, but by being repeated several times. Plans is effete. Rock is not effete.<br /><br />Actually, rock has become effete and nearly extinct. That we have people that call this watered-down, dully pleasant sounding stuff not just &#34;rock&#34; but claim it is a best rock album of the year or others claiming that El Camino by the minimally talented duo Black Keys was the rock album of the year half a decade later (at least that mediocre collection of pop-oriented songs featured some lead instruments), demonstrates to me that rock as a genre of music is effectively dead. The days of creating albums to obtain the reaction: &#34;Wow, that was powerful!&#34; or &#34;That rocked!&#34; is over and we now have albums that seeming were created to obtain the response &#34;I can envision that this may cause some listeners to develop a semi-spiritual but semi-detached rapport with the lyrical and instrumental meanderings on this collection.&#34;<br /><br />I mentioned at the beginning that I had been listening to Michelle Branch lately and although she might most commonly be referred to as a &#34;singer-songwriter&#34; - a label most usually applied to too-frequently-bland pop-folk rock singers - I really like her music.  While my tastes wander all over the place from blues to rock to a bit of jazz and classical, I do have an appreciation for almost any sort of music that has an edge, that leaves an emotional impression and even on softer songs on Hotel Paper than Are You Happy Now (which might be the best rock song since the turn of the millenium), she nonetheless has crafted pleasing-sounding tunes and conveys emotion with her voice - the songs mean something to her and she does what a good singer should do, uses her voice to make the songs mean something to listeners as well.  In contrast, Plans would be effective music to have playing in a mental health facility for overly emotional individuals.<br /><br />Although Plans predates the modern generation of 18-to-20-somethings by several years, it seems to me to be the anthem for a prominent portion of that generation, the sort of person who is uninterested in cars or even in obtaining a driver's license, preferring to live in the city away from the bothers of the outdoors or nature, and preferring to maintain contact with others by texting, Twittering and Facebooking, rather than by telephone, or - eeeh gads! face-to-face interaction with other human beings.  It seems to be music for people who feel little and do less, what one would listen to while blogging about blogs that blog about other blogs.  Weak stuff.<br /><br />===========<br /><br />I am sure this review will draw the ire of many DCFC fans.  Instead of just hitting that &#34;Not Helpful&#34; button, please take the time to write a comment that provides details and examples of exactly why you feel that this review is not accurate.  Don't just call me juvenile names - articulate a convincing opposing argument.  Seriously, point to particular portions of songs that you feel actually distinguish themselves contrary to how I have described this album and if you're right (I don't think anyone will be, but maybe I missed something on a song or two), I'll candidly admit it and publish a correction.  Thank you.<br /><br />EDIT 6/15:  OK, two and a half years after I wrote this review, 9 people rated it and 8 of them rated it Not Helpful and not a single person could be bothered to leave a comment.  This wasn't a &#34;It sux dewd!&#34; trolling review, it was a detailed, very specific review that backed up each one of its criticisms with details, with specifics, with examples.  Come on, you hipster-poseurs, you pseudo-intellectual artiste-with-an-&#34;e&#34; wannabes, post a comment.  A real comment that addresses substantively the points I made, that provides a logical, cogent reason or argument that shows how anything I said is not completely fair, accurate and reasonable.  If you can't do that, then maybe be enough of an adult to admit that perhaps I am right and this review does not deserve a Not Helpful rating.  Prove that you have some appreciation for and understanding of quality music, rather than just rabid loyalty to a band based more on its pseudo-alt-trendy name than on the actual music it produces.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Warner Brother has once again done an excellent job of adapting one of DC's greatest tales of the Batman. On top of the great work on the film there is over an hour of extras well worth watching.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|What kind of world will we leave to our sons?, that is the question. Thanks to Naomi Klein, we understand better how the world wags. Although she does not bring  good news. I wonder if there are any hope of change. We need it.
0439023483|4.0|I originally bought these books for my son but ended up reading them as well.  Easy read and entertaining.  Don't expect LOTR's quality and you won't be disappointed.  Surpirse, the book is better than the movie.  Bet you never heard that before.
1603427244|5.0|My copy is spiral bound which makes it is easy to keep to page where you are trying to follow their instructions.  Strong and weak points for each type are included.  Well organized.  Would recommend to anyone, especially knit project designers.
1569242739|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a niece that loves to bake and loves to be challenged.  She loved it and started using it straight-away.  I've only had a few cupcakes from the book but they were all very good.  Again, this is not a low-cal healthy food despite its veganism.  Still when one wants to indulge this is a good place to start.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fifty Shades Freed is a great ending to the trilogy.  I hope the author writes another trilogy.  I'll buy it!  Fifty Shades Freed:  Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I'm no fan of war and don't partcularly enjoy watching war movies for blood and guts.  I like the human action involved in these things, though. This series did a fantastic job of bringing a world war down to singular people and how devastating war is on people, marriages, families, and communities.  As one would expect the language is a bit salty.
B009VB97EY|2.0|My wife convinced me to watch this movie because of good critic reviews. That was a mistake. The story is boring and almost non-existent. The acting is mediocre at best and the writing is atrocious. Avoid at all costs! My wife did not like it either.
B005LAIISU|3.0|Did not like it as well as the other ice age movie but it was ok. Enjoyable for kids more so than adults. All in all it is worth watching and a good, clean fun type of movie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was much better than my wife and I expected. We definitely recommend it! It is a must see movie!

B0081SPK0I|3.0|Installed on Galaxy Note 10.1, strangly there's pretty good control of the car, but eventually there's so much traffic or the screen scrolls so fast- you will lose. This game is missing something, can't quite put my finger on it (no pun intended). Galaxy SII phone screen size and smaller phones not playable easily because of the road moving too fast.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The book The Bone Bed continues the great Patricia Cornwell style..she deeps you on the edge of your seat reading much longer that you had planned...Love it..Gret Book
B00884GR0W|2.0|This looks like it would be really good for people who have too much time on their hands looking for a better game than solitair. I need five-minute distractions and then back to work. That's not even enough time to figure out how to play this game. Maybe after I retire in 30 years, if this one is still around I'll revisite. Good and stable on my Galaxy SII and Note 10.1, just no memory allocation for an app I won't use.
B000NOK06W|3.0|This is a three CD set and most of the music sounds redundant. I would have been just as pleased with one CD. I will never listen to most parts of this collection because I would fall asleep.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Yes it's a scanned book, but well done and the story itself keeps me entertained every time- like an old I Love Lucy show, it may be black and white, but the acting is always supreme.
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|I loved this. I usually hate musicals but this was great. Tom Cruise is completely believable and Julianne Hough can actually act. Surprising.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|This game is really entertaining but has some bugs in it. Once they get them squared away it should be fun. Until then just hang in there.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I use this with a laptop to navigate on the great lakes. It works extremely well, picks up the satellites fast, and is very responsive. I am very happy with this product.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|I saw this on the plane from Amsterdam to Seattle in October 2012.  Why is it not out on DVD yet?  I'm anxious for it to come out so my family can see it.  Funny, touching, realistic and just makes you feel good.  Excellent movie!
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse writes the most incredible music. Most bands can come up with 2 or 3 songs that are good and a bunch of filler. Muse albums are almost classics from start to finish. In fairness the 2nd Law took longer to get into then say The Resistance. But spend the time it is worth it. Supposedly this band are not big fans of Radiohead. I beg to differ as my favourite song on this CD, Explorers bares a resemblance to Radioheads \\"No Surprises\\". And they have another thing in common with Radiohead. They seem incapable of putting out a bad album. I should note I am giving this a 5 star rating as compared to most albums. Compared to most MUSE albums it's only worth 4 stars.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Having seen the Luc Besson original movie, it's Americanized Brigette Fonda remake and the Peta Wilson TV series, I think this show is the best variation on the Nikita legend.<br /><br />Maggie Q is so sexy as well as dangerous as Nikita, a drug addict pulled from death row by a shadowy government arm called Division to be an assassin in their organization.Shane West is cast as a great Michael, a fellow Division agent tasked with stopping Nikita at all cost even though the two shared an intimate history, Aaron Stanford  stars as Birkoff, Division resident computer hacker and Lyndsy Fonseca does a great job as Alex, a new recruit placed in Division by Nikita to help her bring Division down from the inside. Melinda Clarke has never been sexier than her role as the diabolical Amanda, Division's second in command and Xander Berkeley as the equally evil Percy heads Division and rounds out this great ensemble.<br /><br />Unlike the other Nikita variants, this one explores how long Division's reach is as Nikita rushes to shut down all of Percy's side operations as well as Alex on the inside feeding her intel.<br /><br />This show also focuses on Alex's training and how she gets along with her fellow recruits as she learns friendships don't last in Division.<br /><br />Another plot twist I like is Nikita having knowledge of Percy's Black boxes containing information on every black op job Division did for it's government and the names of the people in the government who sanctioned the missions and the \\"Guardians\\" protecting them.<br /><br />So it's safe to say more ground has been covered in this first season alone of Nikita than the five years La Femme Nikita was on the air.<br /><br />The storyline is amazing. The cinematography is unbelievable and the scripting and direction are so cool. If you have not seen this show, you really should try it and what better place to start than here.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app!  Surfing Pinterest on here is almost as seamless as doing it on your PC.  It is much better than the using it on your cell phone.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Christian Bale as Batman on three blue rays.  With all that what else needs to be said?  Great movie buy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It had a nice story line and then I was surprised with a twist..<br />Don&#34;t wanna give it away :)
B005LAII80|5.0|Ask yourself this, do you like the first RoboCop film?<br /><br /> If you answered yes then this is the movie for you, but if you answered no then this picture is one that you should avoid. It really is that simple.<br /><br /> I don`t know what the nay-sayers are thinking. Did they expect to see a film as deep and character driven as Gone With the Wind or a story as fleshed out and diverse as Citizen Kane?<br /><br /> What you see is what you get and Dredd advertised itself as just that; an action movie that delivers tons of action that will keep you entertained for the duration of its running time.<br /><br /> It`s a film that is meant for Judge Dredd fans in terms of story (As it remained true to a story you would find in the comic book), and thrill seeking audiences in terms of action; nothing else.<br /><br /> The actors do a fine job with their characters and are more than competant in their acting skills keeping whats unfolding on the screen flowing smoothly and tense (Someone in the reviews section said that the acting was some of the worst that they`d seen, but the cast weren`t a bunch of actors overacting or giving the performance of a lifetime that will nab them an Oscar; they acted believably in the roles they were assigned and carried their performances perfectly. Nothing more, nothing less).<br /><br /> The direction is both artful in terms of the fast paced scenes that transpire and also in terms of the beauty that is shown through the slow motion footage (The saying Poetry in Motion comes to mind for the latter).<br /><br /> The CGI/Special Effects are amazing in the graphic violence they portray and the beauty they convey when the Slo-Mo drug is being used (There are many more mentions that I could go into throughout the movie but the examples would turn into a laundry list so I`ll leave it to your viewing experience to see for yourself).<br /><br /> My only gripe with Dredd is the soundtrack but thats only because I`m not a Techno fan so the fault lies with me and not the movie; but other than that thats it.<br /><br /> Here`s what Dredd has going against it (Or so I`m assuming), its a picture made for the fans of the comic book and not for the general audience of theater goers. Those out there that aren`t fans and have no concept or interest in the comic wont get it but for those who are fans of the comic and have been waiting for an honest depiction of Judge Dredd will.<br /><br /> I think the film will win some fans over from the Action genre audience, and from some of the positive reviews that I`ve read Dredd has; but for those who came to see something more than just an Action movie they will be disappointed in what Dredd has to offer because it only has to present what it always advertised; Action and Adventure; and sometimes thats enough.lies with me and not the movie; but other than that thats it.<br /><br /> Here`s what Dredd has going against it (Or so I`m assuming), its a picture made for the fans of the comic book and not for the general audience of theater goers.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The thing that I love the most about this cable is it's extension! It is Long and comfortable to use Kindle while plugged in!
8866130915|4.0|Love these little planners. Electronic / online / synced calendars just don't work for my brain. This little book goes in my pocket with me wherever I go. There is the perfect amount of entry space for each day, and a nice empty page for various to-do lists for the entire week.<br /><br />By the time the year is up, this book is pretty hashed but still holding together (I did add some black tape to a tear in the back folder). The elastic that holds it shut loses some of its tension after a while. When that happens, I just tie a little knot in the elastic to shorten it, and we're back in business. I expect to use this book for years to come.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was excellent.  It wasn't slow in the beginning like some other good books that eventually get better.  It was good from beginning to end.  The characters were perfectly described and I imagined what they looked like as I read the book.  I didn't expect the surprise in the end; but that was a good twist in the story.  I truly enjoyed it and wished I could lend it out to someone I know but I can't just yet.  I absolutely recommend reading this book.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read them all and still own most of them.  However this one which I waiited for a long time to read proved to be quite a disappointment.  Too boring and some things just drag on and on as if the author has no idea where he is going with the storyline.  I learned a lot about a Ford product for which I no anyone else would have an interest.  When I read the book I wasn't in the markey for a car and still am not.  I really believe this was out in a hurry just for the money or to please a publisher.  If this is an example of future fiction from mr. Child then he has lost me as a fan and I have been a big one, always recommending his books to friends and family but I cannot suggest to anyone that they read this one.  What a disappointment and a real shame that his talent has dipped this low.  I read the entire book in one and one half days and if I could re-create the past I would go play golf instead.  What a waste of time.  In the same vein I was already disappointed that Mr. Child \\"sold out\\" to Tom Cruise on the movie rights for One Shot and probably others.  I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan and he certainly does not depict the Jack Reacher character that Mr. Child has created and most of us had fallen in love with for the first and last several books before his lame excuses in the last two.  Write less often and write better or call it quits sir.  You lost some fans on this one.
1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot was doggedly persevering in covering this story and our family is grateful to her for bringing Henrietta's life to awareness.
1423136802|5.0|My 10 year old son asked for this set for Christmas. He was reading the first book in the series before school let out for the holidays.  When I received this shipment he asked if he could have the second book before I wrapped the box so I gave it to him.  He began reading the 3rd book on Christmas day.  He has finished reading all the books in the series as of today.  He loved it!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Refreshing to see my son watch something and smile. Easy to order and enjoy on his kindle. He picked it out.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I only recently learned about this movie and decided to buy it.  One word: BRILLIANT!!!!!!  Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner played phenomenal roles in this.  Should have received more press when it was out!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I deleted it from my tablet it did work at all on it...i couldn't see anything so i just unistalled it.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Awesome movie, I loved iron man. Every one out there should watch this movie, because it is so very awesome.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was good but definitely not the best. I can see the level of creativity dropping just a little bit each book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I am a sucker for a man in tattoos who loves a woman unconditionally, which is basically my husband. I also believe that opposites attract. Abby and Travis are perfect for each other and the chemistry was out of this world. I love a happy ending and this one definitely made me happy. I have already recommended this book to all of my friends. Please read if you get a chance!
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Empowered me to search for my own path of truth about our human existence.  Both science and spirituality are conduits that connect us with the unity of all the universe.  Some of my favorite lines that I still bring to memory when I feel alone:<br /><br />&#34;In all our years of searching, the only thing that makes the loneliness bearable...is each other.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;This is one step.  In time you'll take another.  Small steps, Ellie, small steps.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I was given a vision of the universe that tells us undeniably how tiny and insignificant and how rare and precious we are.  A vision that tells us we belong to something greater than ourselves...that none of us are alone. I wish for one moment we could all feel that awe and humility and hope.&#34;<br /><br />Thank you Carl Sagan, for teaching us the mechanics and meaning of the universe.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Awesome movie, but like I said, extremely dark and very, and I mean *very*, sad. Only watch this if you are prepared to see some lives get completely destroyed. Excellent movie and great acting. The soundtrack by Clint Mansell is truly amazing and fits the movie perfectly.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|This movie always makes me smile and I love so many other movies directed by Richard Curtis too. Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary are two of my favs! I would definitely recommend this movie!
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|was so looking forward to this cd and was sorely disappointed.  with the wealth of songs out there i just think they could have made far better choices.
B008YI91HS|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid and decided to check it out to see if it still held up in the effects department. It did!! This movie still rocks!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed this read very much!  Definitely some violence, but not too gruesome.  Good storyline, and really liked the characters of Katniss and Peeta.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Read all the stories, can't find much better entertainment anywhere.  Hopefully he will write more stories about the different families.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in recent memory and one of my favorite Stephen King books of all time.  King's unique take on time travel and the butterfly effect enthralled me from the beginning, and he kept me hooked with brilliant plot and character development.  If you're interested in time-travel, Stephen King, great storytelling, or all of the above, read this book!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|After seeing season one on TV I had to read all the stories, these books are unbelieveably  good.  Can't wait for season 3 to show up on TV.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I gave this as a gift to my sister-in-law because she loves Michael Buble...She was so happy to receive it.  She has been wanting a CD of his for years.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I have seen all the Rebus shows on PBS and I am so happy that I can read his latest story so quickly, it is a great book.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|James Taylor's beautiful voice has created a wonderful holiday CD.  Every song was enjoyable to listen to and you want to play it all the time.  I now have two copies.  One for my car and one for the house.  It was great to listen to the CD whereever I went.<br />Thanks, James!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This kind of dragged in places, didn't stop me reading the book though. Wish it had ended with more information of what happened to all the characters.  Especially Tyrion....he is my favourite.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love this show!!  Got this season for a great price!! So excited to now own it so I can watch it whenever I want!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a good app! I would recomend this to my friends to get for their phone kindle or whatever device they own.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I purchased this app hoping it would have more features than the free app I had downloaded. Unfortunately I should have just stuck with the free app. This app has less features and functionality.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is easy to access and fun to surf.  However, you have to be quick because it changes from minute to minute.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It gives a peek into the life of a Navy Seal and shows me that the life you have should be enjoyed and that these men truely stand up for what they believe in. An Insperation.<br />Really enjoying this genre.
B001974DG0|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  Suspenseful, touching, very intense with some light and humorous moments.  I could visualize every detail.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Quick fast paced, to the point, prose is crisply written and very fact based almost underwhelming.  It would have been great if it had been combined with the CIA effort in tracking bin laden.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was awesome... very descriptive...  better than Fifty Shades of Grey...  I hope it works out for Gideon and Eva...
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Johnny Depp was wonderful as always at depicting a flamboyant character.  You actually fall in love with Barnabas Collins.  Great soundtrack as well.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|My husband loves it. Thank you so much. This really helped make his (and our) Christmas a truly fantastic one.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|tons of fun to watch. just as good as guy ritchis other movies snatch and lockstock and two smoking barrels.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Great series. Can't praise the writing and acting enough. Wildly dark and entertaining. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good thrill.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|My husband and I watched this on a 'date night' & thought it was a very nice, funny laid back comedy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love the Kindle app and use it across all of my devices. I read for pleasure, for work and for my Master's degree. Having the majority of my textbooks available on kindle is awesome. I love being able to highlight and make notes and then come back to them later in list form when I'm writing papers or reports instead of leafing through the pages of a book to find \\"that quote.\\" The ONLY thing I would love to see is the ability to highlight in different colours. Colour coding is an important part of how I study and having that ability on the Kindle app would make it just about perfect in my eyes! Thanks for a great product!
B00008GKEG|5.0|g r e a t  e v e r y t h i n g!<br /><br />Thanks a  l o t!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Excellent music and lyrics.  It should be marketed much better because it is an unknown work of art. Very enjoyable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an amazingly touching story that will have you rooting for the characters the whole way through. It is touching and will pull at your heartstrings.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|gget this app i got it an hour ago and im still on it. its addicting and great for kids  im 11
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As someone who has followed along with the development of Gene Kim's work with the IT Process Institute I can say with 100 percent certainty that this book is a logical extension of that.<br /><br />Some times we need a story to relate our everyday experiences against. This is a well chosen vehicle for the true goal of the book; helping us improve on the often failed IT/Security/Business relationship. Every organization exists in a continuum whose objective (speaking for private industry) is simple-- to make money. Yet a simple glance at statistics and studies will show us that most companies fail this objective on multiple levels; they don't execute their strategic objectives.  More over they also fail to build logical processes within their IT to ensure that alignment.<br /><br />If you've ever wished there were a textbook to help you align IT and the business, to lower your risk levels through quality implementations of key technology then this book is a great place to start.<br /><br />It may seem odd that this is executed as a fictional story but this serves as a perfect vehicle to convey in very pointed ways the result of a lot of real world research. The road to operational excellence, compliance and higher levels of security in IT isn't easy and this story accurately, albeit sometimes simplistically, showcases that fact. But more importantly it also gives us the tools and mental preparation to make a decision.<br /><br />The choice is simple; you can continue in blissful ignorance and the comfort of business as usual. Or you can embrace the beginning of a more meaningful, competitive organization that embraces process driven excellence.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|This  book was one of the most boring of its genre that I've ever read.  1/3 of the way through the book I fast forwarded to the end because I didn't care to waste my time.<br /><br />Not only was it boring, but the grammar mistakes and mis-spellings made it very frustrating to read.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift.  the recipient was very excited to receive it.  (your word requirements for these reviews is ridiculous)!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've heard this is a great series from others, and I agree. I love the characters (acting is excellent) and the story continues to intrigue me!
B002N9MK8G|5.0|Loved all the music from start to finish.  Sinatra at the Sands.  Brings back so many memories.  Enough is Enough!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Tries to copy bits and pieces of other science fiction movies and create a film noir thriller at the same time.  A good cast isn't given a chance to develop their characers and the movie frequently falls into derivative monotony.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I used this on an old refreshable braille unit. I didn't think it would work, but it did!<br /><br />I was working under Windows 7 and using Window Eyes 7.5.
B002VX0A40|5.0|Purchased this for my granddaughter because she was born in the year of the dragon.  It's cute and she loves it!
B009GYSQV6|5.0|What Crystal Castles is to me (personally)  is truth in music.  absolutely everything this band puts out is exactly the way I imagine it should go.  To me the first album was the &#34;last good times with failure and rage&#34;, the second album was &#34;an attempt to stay alive while kicking and screaming and clawing at life&#34;, this third album feels like &#34;death and acceptance&#34;..  I don't say any of this with a sense of claiming to know what the band was actually thinking, but it is what and how it felt to me.  It is beautiful and gut wrenching at the same time.  The rasps in Alice's voice are at their softest and most surreal.  The music is haunting and melodic as always.  My only gripe about this perfect album is that most people who expect Crystal Castles I still might be turned off if they skim through the album and miss a truly poetic and BEAUTIFUL album.  Everybody who tries to listen to this album, I ask that you listen to every song and all the way through.  You will thank yourself for it and wait painstakingly for more.
0307352145|1.0|Author loses all credibility by blowing big kisses to her idols, BJ Clinton, al-Gorezeera, and Ibama. Who wants to be preached to about the wonders of these three introverts? If she has this bad of judgment when it comes to politicians, how can we trust her to be unbiased on other matters?
B003F3NDOE|5.0|And all good things must come to an end.  The fourth and final season of Ugly Betty tracks Betty and her world and tries it's best to find a reasonable send off point (NOT CLOSURE) for all characters involved.  BRAVO to the main actors (especially Mark Indelicato, Becki Newton, Michael Urie, Vanessa Williams and the super awesome America Ferrera) for giving us some great character acting and real good and sad times.  I will miss this show.  here's the rundown of the fourth and final season.<br /><br />essentially: (BEWARE OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br />-Hilda finds happiness, as the show decided, where and with whom she fits with. (closure)<br />-Ignacio comes to terms with the idea of his girls growing up and finds some sort of love, (we don't get much)<br />-Amanda finds what she's been looking for, or rather it finds her, (we don't get much)<br />-Marc becomes what he wants to be and finally get's credit from everybody who never noticed (closure)<br />-Justin has probably the BIGGEST (duhh) revelation, but it could have sent out more of an impact for the viewers or fans to see him understand himself and be a message for tolerance and acceptance. (agonizing closure but a great story within a story)<br />-Wilhelmina sort of gets what she wants and, SURPRISE, it doesn't come by her schemes or plans after all (closure)<br />-Claire finally finds peace with her family (closure)<br />-Daniel finally realizes what's important and who really matters and takes a huge leap (agonizing closure)<br />-Betty finally takes a next step and a new chapter seems to start and although her love life seems in shambles as always a new possibility presents itself in the end (agonizing closure)<br /><br />Unanswered questions and what we don't get to see or will ever know is:<br />-What about Christina's husband Stewart?<br />-How do Wilhelmina and Claire find a medium given their final circumstances?<br />-Does Ignacio ever get to be with his long distance love?<br />-What happens to Conner?<br />-Does Tyler ever go about tackling his father?<br />-Does Wilhelmina ever find peace with her family (daughter, father, sister)?<br />-Does Alexis and Daniel Jr ever become a family and or return?<br /><br />And of course there is that ending.... I won't spoil that one, BUT OHHHHHHH, to not know what happens is both elegant, fair but a painstaking end to a knockout series.  BRAVO again.?<br />-Does Tyler ever go about tackling his father?<br />-Does Wilhelmina ever find peace with her family (daughter, father, sister)?<br />-Does Alexis and Daniel Jr ever become a family and or return?<br /><br />And of course there is that ending....

B008UTV6S8|5.0|The  combination of  CD and DVD  shows a complete visual and audio experience.I personally prefer the CD version for its sound as the DVD disdracts.
B000LJ9ZWE|5.0|I remembered this movie from my teen years and how it truly scared the pants off of me. It's a classic that still is awesome..
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I wasn't disappointed at all. It was similar to the original, but enough different that there were plenty of surprises.
B004NELBPC|1.0|This app is just awful.  When I open the app the main headline is old news and I have to refresh immediately.  Then the other news items can be 2 weeks old or more.  HuffPo was the go to news app for me for the 2008 election season.  Now I read it through the web, if at all.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the books and the shows, so of course I'm going to love the Blu-ray/DVD combo.
1433502445|5.0|yep. it's the bible. plus lots of other really cool helpful stuff. lots of maps and commentaries and i don't know what else to say.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It's really damning with faint praise to say of this work, \\"It's worth more than 99 cents.\\"  A price of only a buck plants this novel into a swamp of low expectations, which it handily rises above.<br /><br />I appreciated the protagonist's sense of humor, drive to survive, and creativity in solving each new problem.  Entertaining, and surprisingly suspenseful given the \\"dear diary\\" format of his monologues.
B005LAII1C|1.0|not very good...slept thru it  The movie Ted was a dissapointment  it is rare that I buy a movie and it will be a long time till I buy another

B002U3CCKQ|5.0|Fantastic. I have read all three of Gillian Flynn's Novels.  Her first two are definately her best!  Highly recommended reading.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Everything about it is perfect, the quality, the looks, the sound. It spells perfection.<br />Not to mention it looks like the vinyl release, I thought that was pretty cool.<br />This is for all time Smiths fans, even if you don't listen to them as much, get this!<br />I love it so much, it came in today and the albums I've heard are just ugh, so great.
0765325950|1.0|Question: Why a delayed ebook release for A Memory of Light?<br /><br /> Answer from Brandon Sanderson:<br /><br /> This is not my decision or Tor's decision, but Harriet's. She is uncomfortable with ebooks. Specifically, she worries about ebooks cutting into the hardcover sales. It isn't about money for her, as the monetary difference between the two is negligible here. It is about a worry that her husband's legacy will be undermined if sales are split between ebooks and hardcovers, preventing the last book of the Wheel of Time from hitting number one on either list. (Many of the bestseller lists are still handling ebooks in somewhat awkward ways.)<br /><br /> As the last books have all hit number one, she doesn't want to risk one of these not hitting number one, and therefore ending the series on a down note. (Even though each Wheel of Time book has sold more than its predecessor, including the ones I have worked on.) I personally feel her worries are unfounded, and have explained that to her, but it is not my choice and I respect her reasoning for the decision. She is just trying to safeguard Robert Jordan's legacy, and feels this is a very important way she needs to do so. After talking about the issue, we were able to move the ebook up from the originally planned one-year delay to instead come out this spring.

B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I would not recommend this game. It is a disappointment. You start to play and get so addicted then it shuts down and will not even open. I do not understand why gameloft cannot fix this because it seems that other players are having this problem as well. If these issues are resolved I would highly recommend this cute game!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|My daughter does not like this but my niece kind of likes it.  She says it is too hard to play

B003YL4LYI|4.0|So I finally got through this book! I've been reading it forever! And by that I don't mean to say that I didn't like it or that it was hard to get through, because it wasn't. Or at least, not any harder than any other of Martin's books. It's just a situation where I wasn't in a hurry because this was book 5 and book 6 isn't expected out for a long time (2015 according to Goodreads.com). So I would read a few chapters, then not pick it up for a few weeks. I read several other books, finishing them first while ADWD was on the back burner. It came and went, but I decided that I finally needed to finish it.<br /><br />As for the book, I won't talk much about the plot because, as I said before, this is book 5 and I don't want to do too many spoilers for earlier books. If I do any I'll warn you first.<br /><br />I've said it before and I'll say it again: I LOVE this story! The characters and settings and conflicts are masterfully done and once you get into the story, you just can't put it down. That said, Martin's writing style can be a big difficult to get into. You have to get used to the way he writes. His style isn't bad or amateur. It's just kind of heavy.  Then again, if you make it all the way to book 5, I suppose you would've made your peace with the writing hundreds of pages ago.<br /><br />While book 4 focused a lot on the less mainstream story lines, Book 5 goes back to the more central conflicts and characters we've come to love. Many people have criticized this book for its meandering and...I can kind of see their point. I do wish Martin would move the story along a bit more quickly rather than going into detail about characters, cities, and cultures that have nothing to do with the main characters. Yet, being a writer, by the time I got to the end, I could see how he was shaping the story and where he was going all along. He just could have gotten there sooner.<br /><br />I've also heard criticism about the title because this sounds like it will feature a lot of dragon action, but, according to others, they barely spread their wings. I don't agree with this criticism. Though it's true that the dragons aren't the central element in the plot, I do think they were what this installment was always working up to. Near the end Barriston Selmy gives the title it's meaning. He says, Not all men are meant to dance with dragons.  Notice that the \\"dance\\" of the title is singular, not plural. *minor spoiler* The character that does the \\"dance\\" dies in the process. I promise this is not a major spoiler because it was not a major character, but still, when you think of it that way, the Dance with Dragons in this book ended in death. So the point of the title is that the story points toward the cliff hanger end, which is full of death and ruin.<br /><br />One could argue that there are other dragon dances of course, literal in the case of Daenarys and the death pits and figurative for Jon Snow. All threads end in disaster (fitting for a novel which isn't the final one) and while the novel stalled a bit in the middle, the end left me desperately wanting book 6.<br /><br />There was also a very touching chapter near the end with Daenarys looking back over her recent choices and conversing with an imagined someone that she regrets having sent away. I found it very touching as it strayed into literary fiction and had a sweet, melancholy feel. Possibly my favorite part of this book.<br /><br />Overall, if you're into Martin's series, this is simply a continuation of the story. It may not be the most exciting installment (nothing has equaled Book 3 yet) but it's important to read this to get to the next part. Martin has set up some exciting things for book 6 and--like all the other epic fantasy suckers--I will be pre-ordering it when it becomes available.

159413586X|5.0|purchased the 3rd book of the triology.  Just did not realize that this was large print.  Luckily my kid does not really care, it will probably be better for him anyway with school reports
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I use this on my Android tablet. I've run one scan of the tablet, and it found nothing, which is about right, since I didn't think that there were any viruses present, anyway. I feel better having it on hand.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|After reading the first three books of the series, feast was a bit of a let down. The point of view characters' stories did not really connect to each other. There was no mention of the wall or dany, which was disappointing. I did enjoy arts and Brown's story lines. Jamie's story felt incomplete.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|An absolutely fulfilling read! I was utterly captivated from start to finish. Two Graves is one I did I did not want to end.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I like all versions of this movie and I own 2 including this one.  We live in times where giving has become for a lot of us out of recieving and not from the heart and for some giving is not a thing to do at all.  Great classic and I love it.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Fans of ABC's &#34;Castle&#34; will enjoy reading the story & visualizing the actors' performances. Fun twist: the author acknowledges his friends at 12th Precinct (Kate, Javier, etc) and his family (Martha & Alexis) but also thanks Nathan, Stana, and all the other actors who play the roles. Kinda messes with your head!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I was looking for a brainless action movie full of explosions and bullets, and this movie was perfect. It almost reminded me of a plot to a video game, This is the better Dredd Film

B009UNGYHG|5.0|I purchased this as a companion to the Plantronics Voyager and I love it. The headset fits snugly in the device and it easily fits into my shirt pocket.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I did not give it 5 star rating because there were no lyrics written for the amazing album.  I recommended it to all who have loved and lost!  Adele is so wonderful!.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|The Fountinhead has always been my favorite Ayn Rand book. THE treatise on individualism, I read it when I was working in a factory where you were expected to be a cog in the great machine no matter the sacrifice. It reawakened my personal individualism and I quit the job. The movie is just as great, especially considering the cinematic technology of the time. This is a must have for all of the &#34;don't-tread-on-me&#34; people out there.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spend hours and hours and never tire. Always a great game. Can be so frustrating and then all of a sudden you hit the jackpot.
B003QF8E4A|5.0|Gripping story with a surprise ending! This movie had me sitting on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I was given an advance copy of this book to review -- thanks guys. I'm glad I had the opportunity!<br /><br />I always enjoy a good story, and the authors tell a fascinating tale here of things that can go wrong with IT in companies today. It starts off as kind of a worst case scenario, with our hapless hero stuck with cleaning up a massive IT disaster. It's an easy read that many IT professionals will identify with, and occasionally cringe about when they recognize their own situations far too closely.<br /><br />And apart from simply being a fun read, you'll end up learning some worthwhile lessons about -- well, how to clean up massive IT disasters.<br /><br />Great work, guys!<br /><br />Certainly a worthwhile read for anyone in IT today. Highly recommended.
0553801473|2.0|I have for a long time been invested in the ASOIAF series by GRRM. I starting reading the series shortly after the publication of ASOS and I re-read all the books again in preparation for the publication of ADWD, having pre-ordered the book on Amazon.<br /><br />Reading the previous books so closely before reading ADWD, has just highlighted to me the drop in quality through the latter two books. There are some chapters in ADWD that held my interest but for the most part the story just drags and after about 600 pages I put down the book. I have since tried several times to return to the story, but each time the lack of any real plot development has caused me to put it aside and pick up something more interesting to read.<br /><br />As one of the many fans that eagerly awaited ADWD, I am very disappointed in what GRRM has delivered. I think that the poor quality of ADWD, is in part due to the myriad projects that GRRM is involved with (see his online blog). The ASOIAF books are not his primary interest any more. The proportion of his time allocated to actually writing these books has diminished substantially and hence the length of time between books is increasing on an exponential scale. I expect that the HBO series will have completed filming the events in ADWD long before The Winds of Winter ever gets published. Then it will be for the HBO script writers to try and tie all the lose ends together and salvage the series.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book made me feel a peace and comfort I was longing for after experiencing the death of my parents (within 36 days of each other). After several vivid dreams of my mom, with whom I had a contentious relationship, I feel the need to let go and trust that God forgives. Only love survives. The message Dr Alexander so bravely shares is profoundly needed. THANK YOU Dr.Alexander. I am a believer.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought I would hate this series because of the &#34;games&#34; idea. But it did become very thought provoking and I read all three books in a few days!
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Good idea and maybe some will like it. I did not. Reason when I sit  and watch a movie I just want to be entertained I do not want to try and figure out who is who, what is what. If your going to do a time travel film you better do it right this was far from being done right. (Example Back to the Future Excellent series) The action at times was going so fast dont know what the heck is going on, a choppy movie, a poor sound mix! If you set your sound so you can hear them speak and a explosion goes off you it is way to loud I was having to constant adjust volume for dialoge and then diff volume for action. Shame on the post sound mixers!! Poor locations like it was shot in a back ally, overall just thought it was kinda dumb.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Linda here and not Carlisle. I was sick and looking for something to read. Some friends had read the series and talked about how great it was but I balked at the mere idea of the Games. But I thought I would give it a go. I realized what that the whole thing was in the future and about the possibilities of what evil gov'ts can do. Thought provoking and I read all three books in  just a few days.

B005VPRETE|5.0|This was so cool when I saw it listed. Granddaughter loved it. Very pleased with the product but a bit expensive as all legos are
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Very diverse, easily plays media files and easy to use. Easy to install, and works well with the Kindle Fire
B005VPRDAY|4.0|I find Legos a great item overall but a bit expensive She loved it and that's what counts. Will buy more.
B0086700CM|2.0|This is not the kind of game I usually play, and I'm still trying to figure out mechanics of control to make it farther than thr fourth hurdle.  The Fire may not be the best platform for this - sometimes when I feel I have clearly made the motion to turn, he jumps off the path to his death.  Path seems to be continually changing randomly, so there is no anticipation what may be ahead.  It your finger is not fast enough this may become frustrating and boring real fast.  The major thing I don't like is they expect you to pay real money to get more things to play the game with - and no return on the money you spent.  Even if I become proficient, this real money hitch is enough to keep it at no more than three stars...
B000W9179M|5.0|This journey has touched me in a more profound way and in such depth of my being.  I have too been caught between the dark and light, but could never quite explain or understand it.  I thank all who made this journey possible and especially Paulo and Chris for opening up their personal and private experiences.<br /><br />Gary
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I won a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; at my office party, so didn't mind paying for a case.  This was the least expensive, but looked to be the best value of those offered.  I am glad I made this choice - it fits perfectly, folds easily, holds my Fire where I want it, provides protection for my device, and looks great.  Wish you had other color choices in stock, but maybe around Christmas they all sold out.  I like the red anyway.  Nice sturdy all vinyl construction all vinyl and easy to clean, feels like it will survive for a long time.

B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I had expected to be able to use this in a similar fashion as a journal, but the text boxes don't really seem to be useful in that manner.  It's rather difficult to type in the text box, even more difficult to try to edit or correct anything, and even MORE difficult to save anything and find it again in any form that is usable.  Even for free, I deleted it not only from the carousel, but also from the device AND the cloud.  Not worth the (free) price IMHO...
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I love zombies, so I bought this thinking it would be a great zombie book. Wrong. It is sooooooo boring. Jusdt a compilation of stories from people who survived the zombie apocalypse but they are a collection of small stories that just plod along and never get exciting in any way. I feelt like I am reading a high schoolers term paper. I put the book down halfway through.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great graphics, changeable cars, huge variety of games, and good rules and &#34;how-to&#34; instructions.  My ponly cvomplaint is there is no way to cheat when the one card you really need is in the middle of the three and you lose - agsain.  But the gsames play as they should, it works portrait or landscape as you prefer, you can change the cards or games easilt and quickly, and almost all the games have statistical records (resettable) to keep trak of your win/loss stats.  This is a real keeper!
B007SPN5MA|5.0|Happened to hear glen Hansard on parenthood.  I've listened to his cd over and over since receiving it. Very mellow and sets the mood.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Not exactly the musical - this is a LONG story, but as a classic so well written it is all very enjoyble.  Be prepared to read for a long time before you get to the Revolution, and remember the musical and movie are BASED on the book - the book was NOT written from the stage or movie.  Relax and enjoy the read - you will be glad you did.
B005HSL626|4.0|My daughter told me she likes the game.  It is kind of fun to watch her enjoy this game so i will agree with her.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I have so much fun playing Angry Birds, have three games on my PC and two 0n my Kindle Fire.  This is the toughest of all of them, so even though it may take you longer to succeed in doing away with all the pigs, it's worth it for the satisfaction of finally saying &#34;So there, PIGS!&#34;  Get this game and PRACTICE!  It's a fun way to waste some time...
B00571F26Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book. My brother thought I should read it. The documentation is thorough and I've decided to cut back on wheat products and follow some of the diet plan he gives in the last chapters.<br />If more studies verify his findings, this will shake up the basis of the &#34;Heart-Healthy&#34; diet and also shake up the agricultural industry as we know it.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Or maybe it was the game and lack of instructions.  I never got the hang of this, messed around for 30- 45 minutes trying to figure it out.  Quit, and deleted...
B007SGM084|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read in a long time. It is so good I read it a second and third time.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This was kind of cute - for about 72 seconds.  I tried it six times, six different age guesses ranging from 23 to 48.  My wife did same, same kind of results,  Deleted, don't intend to restore.  Pass this, even if it is free.  It never came even almost close to my real age and got boring real fast.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|very cute story, I just wish it was longer but it had a good story line that kept you interested.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I ran down the battery on my daughter's phone, found three versions for my PC, and now have two games on my Fire.  They are all great fun, almost addictive, a great time-waster - but still great fun especially for a free game that last for hours and hours and days... I have even gone back on some levels trying to get three stars on every game.  Don't miss this one!!
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|\\"Fade\\" is the thirteenth album since 1986 for \\"Yo La Tengo.\\"  \\"Fade\\" is not a departure but a welcome addition of eclectic, frolicking, and heart warming/breaking songs from Yo La Tengo.  I am continually amazed that through all the years they have kept such a high level of mastery.  They don't seem to be losing creativity or fervor, as each album adds something new, exciting, and different to their repertoire.  Yet, the music maintains all the familiar elements that we've come to love from YLT.<br /><br />This album is filled with meditative, catchy and hum inducing songs.  Part of what made me fall in love with YLT is their ability to make music that defies characterization.  My favorite album from them is \\"I am not afraid of you and I will beat your ass.\\"  To me that album had all of what I love about YLT.  The previous albums like \\"I can hear..\\" and \\"And then nothing...\\" all seem to have more thematic musical elements as through lines.  \\"I am not afraid...\\" did the same but was able to take the band to places they hadn't been before, with added strings and instrumentation, while expanding their singing style somewhat.  \\"Fade\\" falls closer to the styles of their earlier albums with a couple exceptions, including the closing track, \\"Before We Run,\\" which is one of the highlights of the album.  It utilizes horns, synths, and nice textured drum lines.  The song really builds through its six minute span, and it entrances you in a way that only YLT can do.  I wish there were more songs like this on the album.  Some other highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Well You Better,\\" a somewhat up-beat song asking the listener to \\"make up your mind before it's too late.\\"  The song has a great catchy organ that plays along with the drums and the ska-like guitar playing from Ira.  It's one of the easiest songs to remember on the album because of the phrasing and call and response between Ira and the organ.  Love this song...!<br /><br />\\"Stupid Things,\\" an upbeat yet meditative eclectic song about the \\"stupid things\\" that make up being in a long term relationship.  It's joyful and sad at the same time.  My favorite lyrics on the album, and the song engulfs you as you listen to it.  Like many YLT songs the songs builds throughout without the listener realizing it.<br /><br />\\"I'll be Around,\\" a great song with a droning bass line, pulsating drum machine, and soothing vocals from Ira.  It's about this point in the album that you start to realize what the theme of the album is.  It's about getting older in a relationship and two people working together as a unit.  This song is a beautiful testament to that.<br /><br />\\"Cornelia and Jane,\\" sung by Georgia plays like a letter back to her husband who sings the previous track, \\"I'll be around.\\"  It has a similar pulsating beat, but it is more feminine in its delivery, which is more delicate and features horns, and a reverberating guitar.  The song slows down towards the end, as Georgia speaks of failed communication.  Her voice is displayed beautifully here.<br /><br />Overall this is a beautiful album.  All the other songs besides those mentioned above provide a cohesive, transcendental experience.  This is the kind of music you can put on and get lost in.  I guarantee listening to it will make your day better!tic song about the \\"stupid things\\" that make up being in a long term relationship.  It's joyful and sad at the same time.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game! Its a mix of solving puzzles and a hidden objects game. I couldn't put it down.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game for the entire family.  Easy to learn interface. Excellent way to challenge the brain for all ages. Highly recommended!
B0085A9HXS|3.0|This was filmed in Indonesia. It was dubbed in English by well-spoken men with perfect voices. I use subtitles, but I wanted to hear the native language. The dubbing was excellent most of the time. It had lots and lots of killing and gore. I'll give it three stars for that.
B004Y042N8|3.0|The game is a good waste of time and provides some great challenges. One thing I do not like is the lack of an exit option. To close the game you use your back button only. I will uninstall until this is an option.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Tina' s my girl. I love all her tv writing but this book, while funny, wasn't as funny as I'd hoped. Good for a plane ride if you're not expecting a Pulitzer.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I love this cd! Great band. I highly recommend this cd to any people who enjoy a bit of rock with a female lead.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|This album is excellent BUT where on earth are the other songs!? If I only wanted the \\"highlights\\" I would purchase the songs individually. If it hadn't been given to me as a gift I would definitely wait for the entire musical to be released.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|He wanted to download this to my kindle - well he did and it cost $6.99 and then he could not play it.....it takes up to much space on the kindle to play it.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|“The 100-Year-Old Man…” was an interesting story, but I found it to be a little slow.  If you enjoyed &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; you'll likely appreciate the style of this book, the main character &#34;stumbles&#34; into historical events and persons much like Forrest Gump did.
B0031ES8P6|3.0|I'm not unhappy with this product, but it was quite a bit smaller than I expected. I should have been more prepared by the size and the fact that it is a beanie baby. It's still very cute, and my niece loved it. I just wish it would have been a bit bigger.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is about Jake, a man who has an opportunity to go back in time and change the past. He decides that he is going to try to stop the Kennedy assassination, as he thinks this event was the cause of some pretty negative things that have happened. He finds out as much as he can about Lee Oswald and watches the family, assimilating himself into the time as much as possible while trying to stand out as little as possible. But one thing he learns is that changing the past does not always guarantee you'll get the future you want.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, I knew I wanted to read it. Being in my 20s, I was not even alive when JFK was assassinated, let alone aware of the repercussions this event could have. I have heard time and again about what a great president he was, so this book really intrigued me. The characters and the storyline immediately pulled me in, and I did not want to put this book down. Jake's experiences through the past and the time and effort he puts into his main goal are extensive and interesting, and there was never a dull moment for the reader. I found myself wishing I could have experienced life in this time period, just to be a part of something as great as what Jake was having an opportunity to be a part of.<br /><br />Overall, FANTASTIC read! I'm sure Stephen King fans will devour this one, but even if you aren't a regular reader, I would recommend this book. It is such a great story and the characters are fantastic!
B009CG955Y|4.0|Good kids movie, though I see the political agenda behind the show. While I agree with the message its not that simple.
0446547646|5.0|I just love Nicholas Sparks and this book is right up there in the ratings as all his other books.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Son loves it and makes him think of different ways to accomplish tasks! Good Fun for whole family. Good for rainy days
1455523550|5.0|Yet another amazing book by Nicholas Sparks. I would recommend this book to my friends and coworkers. Hopefully the movie will be good as well.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was actually interesting for the first 4 chapters.  After that it was like reading a shampoo bottle....wash, rinse, repeat.  Same scenarios, wording, etc.  Did not even consider reading the second book.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Very simply and easy to read and understand. You just have to sit and read, and you will be happy.
B001CN2WXM|4.0|Simply put, great movie, if you love this time period, you will love it, good action, great acting , great cast, ( im not the biggest russel crow fan, perfect part), my son watched with me on cable, love it , this copy was for him...
B009NX4PVU|5.0|Strong performances from Tom Hanks(an AIDS victim) and Denzel Washington(a homophobic African-American).<br /><br />This is an older movie, from the early days of the HIV epidemic, when the virus was largely confined to drug users and gay men, full-blown AIDS was a swift death sentence, ignorance/fear about causation abounded in the worldwide consciousness, and victim-blaming was openly rampant. Denzel Washington never goes over the top with the irony of his portrayal of a bigoted Black man, and Hanks is suberb as always as the dying Andrew.<br /><br />This movie is all about the importance of compassion---never, ever losing it; in that, Philadelphia is just as timely today as when it was filmed. Without our compassion for each other, we might as well have no souls.
B00068TJM6|5.0|Does it all - just as expected - love this watch - manual somewhat helpful in figuring out features but not written by an english major
B009EAALEW|5.0|Can not go wrong with Chris Isaac music. He is the best my wife loves him and thought this was a great album.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I watched the movie before I read the book, but the book, of course, was even more amazing than the movie. Fantastic book.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I enjoyed the writing style, the plot is good and the twists are excellent.  The different sections are probably more effective read like episodes of a series as opposed to a novel for the collective lacks cohesion.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Just the kind of thing that I love to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. My guilty pleasure. A delightfully familiar story given a fresh twist.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I first read looking for Alaska after my boyfriend (who NEVER reads) recommended it. I loved it!! A year later I heard about The Fault in Our Stars, and I'm glad to say that John green has wrote two of the best books I have ever read. I'm not an emotional person but in the two books I've read by him I cried like a baby both times. The stories feel real and are very easy to get into. And after the first few pages you are addicted!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The animation was impressive.  The movie is a great story about family, feminism, and being who you are.  It is definitely worth the watch.
B008JFUTT0|4.0|Thirty years removed from the distribution of his last record, a small group of dedicated fans seek the truth behind the mysterious singer-songwriter known as Rodriguez. Though his career was little more than a hiccup on his native American turf, it resonated with the oppressed majority in South Africa. There he's become a legendary figure; the myth of Rodriguez is larger than life, complete with multiple urban legends which debate the nature of his untimely demise. Wonderfully produced, with gorgeous transitions and an artist's sense of composition, the material and its resolution left me underwhelmed. No matter how many times the narrators try to compare Rodriguez to the heavyweights of his era - Dylan, the Stones, Elvis - I just can't hear what they're hearing, and that makes the magnitude of his story harder to appreciate. It's an entertaining yarn, with a good twist or two up its sleeve, but too often I felt like it was belaboring a point in lieu of additional substance. Light viewing with a penetrating warmth and a catchy soundtrack.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Challenging and fun for all ages.  We introduced it to adult family members after opening gifts at Christmas.  It was easy to learn the basics, but strategy evolved with experience.  It was a fun filled afternoon!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The tension of finding all 8 pages before he gets you....gets ur heart goin. And even more so when he finds you. Playing this in the dark alone at night....thats almost too much. Even playing around others in daytime gets u to jump out of ur skin. No other app can scare you like this one. Maybe this might be the only app that has been able to do it. Worth the $$$ for the one of a kind experience that will have you talking about it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Hard time getting into the story, but hang in there and keep reading... Its worth it! If you like this read the book about Jacee Dugard, Excellent book also!
B00AY9RV90|5.0|These songs were recorded during the same time Waiting for the Sirens Call was recorded. They were intended to be included on the next album, but the band broke up. These are all really great songs, and they show just how talented New Order is.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was an amazing book to read. Can't wait to start the second book...interested to see what will happen next.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Saw this at the theater with my son and rented it a couple years later. Enjoyed it both times.  Worth renting for sure!
B0085A9J18|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in theatres and I absolutely loved this movie recommend if you love guns, knives, and martial arts it is a definate buy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a must read, this book will have you turning pages until your done reading it. Your always going to want to know<br />What happens next. This is one of the best books I've read soo far, it's heartbreaking and full of passion. I definitely recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this book because it kept you guessing who was on which side.  The third should be interesting. Looking forward to reading it.
B000FCJZ4K|3.0|It is good but not updated with todays technology. Some of his advice is usefull but very common sense that just helps as a good reminder. I would say it is an ok book, but not missing anything special.
B00164GDD2|4.0|We love this movie it is so funny. Great vaule and shipping was fast.  Its a must have for your collection. Family movie night for older kids.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I mean the computer version is amazing!!!!!  but mine alwase freezes up and glitches to much. but this version rarely freezes and glitches and I can play online and not have a single glitch; or even a cliche!!!<br />this game is the second best.
B004KKXMSI|4.0|Great movie set for the whole family.  Get your popcorn and have a fun movie night.  My son loved this for Christmas but we all enjoyed it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved how it played out... not the best one though! Still loved it! Very easy to read! Cheap... and you will get your money out of it!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|these book is also actually a nice book because from my own  view i saw it to be a nice book and it is really nice and i love these book also as the rest
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my Brother.  He loved it and told me that this a a classic gangster series that still is good today.  A great movie with an all star cast.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|i love these book and it is actually a nice book and it is good also for entertaining when inuse
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Sigourney Weaver does a fantastic job in all 3 of the movies.  A tale of Aliens and the Humans fighting them.  A classic Sci-Fi Horror series that is still good to this day.
B0083Z614S|5.0|these book is a nice book and it is good to rate it now and it is not actually bad if you don't rate it but i am just trying to determine that it is good you rate it
B003IHUI0O|5.0|This movie was great; has depth to it, drama, surprise, romance, great acting, good story. This is one of those movies you can see more than once, and each time you see it you see different thigs you missed the first time around, that's a great movie.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|i love these bookbecause it is educational and it teaches alot and also good for small kids and it can help in a child's vocabulary that's a child rating from age 10 to whatever extend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love Love Loved it...hate for it to end...so im reading it slowly...Hope they do release a movie of it or a 3 part mini series..Was a wonderful story..Hope it has a great ending..OOH LALA...Fifty Shades of Gray book 3
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very nice game for all ages! It is very fun and a great wayto learn how to own businesses and such.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow. For a girl who hates reading I could not put the book down. The first couple chapters were boring compared to the rest of the book. I tried putting the book down so I could sleep but would read one more chapter. I suggest this book. To anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game...play it on my phone also...have my husband playing and some family members to....very fun game...one of the better games
B005HSG3U6|3.0|The case is good but the stand isn't very sturdy.  It is ok if you're placing the Kindle on a table and not touching it but any other time and the stand isn't strong enough to hold the Kindle up.
B00631VJLE|4.0|This item arrived timely and did meet the item description. My daughter liked their Karmacode cd better, their cover of Losing my Religion here is good though.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like creepy and weird then go no further, we have a winner!  I was a fan of season 1 but season 2 in now my favorite.
0307352145|5.0|This book has been a conversation starter for so many events.  Helps break an intervert out of her shell.  Or all the rational I needed to enjoy the party from my wallflower post.
1582701709|1.0|I told the doctor my family didn't need any fancy flu shots, because we all know THE SECRET.  For three years in a row, somebody in my family has gotten the flu.  At first I thought somebody wasn't doing it right, so I made them all to read it again.  Then this year we ALL got sick.  Also, I thought this book could help me save money on smoke alarms, but THE SECRET didn't stop that electrical fire.  Is there any way it can get us out of this shelter?
043902353X|5.0|Fast read.  Aimed at young readers but worth checking out if you're an adult.  Good to know what your children are reading and has a social message.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like to have music playing when I wake up.  The music will only play for about 10 minutes, so I setup multiple alarms so I can play what I want.  I set each alarm for 4 minutes so I can hear many songs, as it doesn't seem to play my playlists.  It works well for me.
0439023548|5.0|Fast read.  Aimed at young readers but worth checking out if you're an adult.  Good to know what your children are reading and has a social message.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is a great case to protect my Kindle.  Before having this case I was always worried that my Kindle would accidentally get scratched or dented. Now there are no more worries. Happy Kindle Happy Me!
0439023521|5.0|Fast read.  Aimed at young readers but worth checking out if you're an adult.  Good to know what your children are reading and has a social message.
B004EF6632|5.0|Thank god for Amazon Instant Video!  This is a fantastic British drama from BBC.  It reminded me a lot of Masterpiece Theatre's Jane Eyre that came out a few years back.  The acting is stupendous and the characters grab onto your heartstrings and never let go!  Give this mini-series a go.  You won't be disappointed.
1400069289|5.0|I haven't read it yet. But it's on the Best Sellers List.  Next book in our Book Club Line up.
B000NA28I4|4.0|I had not read the books, so the movie was watched on its on merit. I would actually rate the movie 4 1/2 stars.  I found the movie to be very enjoyable. I thought it was very well done.  It seemed to me the movie was a little short, but I did enjoy it and look forward to seeing it again. Now I will go read the books.
0307591549|5.0|People could see the difference on my face when I was reading this book.  Just reading it made me happier.
B00328R21C|4.0|There is almost nothing more iconic in the Star Wars world than Luke's land speeder. I was glad i found this and could introduce my kids to the &#34;older&#34; movies.  Like all Lego products it is well made - i just wish Legos coul dbe more affordable compared to other building kits. Easy to put together. My 8 year old daughter did it in about 1 hour.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked the book and I would recommend it just don't expect any surprises in the plot.  The characters are likable.  You find yourself cheering for Lou yet knowing that things will all play out just as they do.
B000059TEQ|5.0|My kids had never heard of this movie so I purchased it for them to see. We all love it and it is a movie you can watch over and over.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Not the worst movie we've seen.  Not the best either....Not planning to watch this again, not good enough, very eh...
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I started listening to Celtic Women last year and have fallen in love with all of their music. Great listening.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this for my grandson he loved it.  Dr. Seuss movies are classics and are always great to watch.  Good movie.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|This is good music and lots of fun to have for any collection and is as new as when this music first came out.  On this Cd it is in very good condition and the quality is good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|His book is wonderful shows that anything can turn out alright and I thank you for that. I love it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a fantastic family movie.  It has something for everyone.  I highly recommend it. My kids, teenager, and wife and I enjoyed this film.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing spider...moves quickly.  Don't like the popup ads but I can deal. Now is the time for all
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Good story. Likeable & realistic characters. It is the \\"Grease\\" of 2012. Loved it & so did my kids. Great subtle (& not so subtle) adult humor.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Again, I enjoy this game.  It's quick and enjoyable.  Good commercial habit. You'll have to be satisfied with what I wrote
B0096BIENY|5.0|It is a wonderful CD, one of their best.  The new songs are great and the collection from all of their albums wonderful.
B003R50F00|5.0|I know.  This is a book that you will either love or hate. No middle road it seems.  I love this.  The imagery, the language and the ease of the read.  I have been surprised that people do not like this but that is what makes the human race interesting.  Marcus has written for an age group and this book possibly is for that age group, so call e adolescent ... I do not care.  The people I know who have read it are from 23 to 67...they all love it.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much my husband developed &#34;book envy&#34; and had to pick it up when I finished. It really brings presidents to life, from Truman's shell shocked ascention to a clearer sense of the working styles and interactions of our more recent chief executives. Their relationships and their respect for the office provide a nuanced, deeper look at a vital branch of our democracy and lifts it from the partisan ugliness we're enduring today. The writing style is crisp and very readable. I'm not an avid reader of history, but this book has fueled a growing interest and left me feeling better informed.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't care for this twisted tale but I had to see it through to the messed up ending. These characters actually depress you...every single one of them! From the main characters to the police officers and parents. They are all so colorless for one reason or another. The premiss of the storyline is exceptional so it's a shame that it couldn't have been used for more lovable (or at least believable) players. I'd love to read a tale that is woven from this fabric about people that you can care about...love them or hate them but not the indifference that this author invokes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At the end of this book the author says he reads these reviews. That being said....<br /><br />To the author,<br /><br />I really liked your book. Thank you for writing it.<br /><br />To anyone else,<br /><br />I'm adding my name to the pile. I figure the more people that do this, the more people that read this book. I think that's a good thing.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Michael
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual, Stephen King spins a good tale that gets you thinking. I really enjoyed this one- I'm not one to read all his books, but glad I did this one!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follet's Century trilogy has provided two wonderful books, drawing the reader through five different points of view of the first and second World Wars -- and beyond. We live history and enjoy the journey. I recommend this to everyone, especially those, like me, who were not particularly interested in history in school. Both books are long, but they're definitely worth it!
B00A50PE6K|4.0|One Christmas song from the show was not on the CD & that made it a little disappointing.  The song was &#34;Oh Holy Night&#34; sung by Lea Michele.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Best book I ever read.....this being the third time that I have read it. Find something new and insightful every time.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I have only used this app for a couple of days and so far I really like it!  It functions well and has many nice features such as options for repeated items (annual events like birthdays and anniv.) Likewise there are nice reminder options.  There are icons for different events which makes it easy to spot a birthday at a glance.<br /><br />I would like to see the option for different calendar views however that is not critical.<br /><br />The task and memo's portion is nice and items with start and end dates tie back nicely to the calendar.<br /><br />Overall nice app!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love dragonvale!!! Have the app on my iPhone and now on my kindle.  Can't wait to get started on it!!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I ordered shortly before Christmas and I was able to get it before Christmas so I could wrap it as a gift. Also at a great price, really glad I purchased this item.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got it for my grandson. We both love to play it so now all my grandkids all have it ane play all together.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Interesting , but unrealistic,  plot that never really got to a point where I couldn't put it down. No real surprizes.  Hard to connect with  main characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We all try for weeks to get this one for my grandson  and for some reason we could not get it .but grandma  was the winner  I got it a he loves it

B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I haven't played Backgammon for yrs ... was so excited about this download ...well worth the 99cents ... I couldn't be more pleased with an app.
B005LAII80|5.0|I must say I'm impressed with this movie, having enjoyed the comic books for years. With Karl Urban as Dredd his physique and acting matched what I remember from the comics perfectly.  I'm just bummed that they don't see doing a sequel anytime soon.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Free app can't complain about it ... not exactly what I really want but to change up game playing every now & again it will do for now
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is a really good show. I thought it was going to be another highschool drama show but its more than that, keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Probably gonna have to delete and download again .. can't access this app ... using same pw & all but will not let me log in from my phone or from the kindle .. wonder if this is FB way of getting me to sign up for their phone (android) app they offer on the site ... tried to log in so many times when I first downloaded it, it locked me out of my FB acct for the day ... I appreciate the protection but what the heck???
B004WKI204|5.0|Tina Fey's book is more than just a memoir of her life - it's smart, it's funny, it's feminist and full of fantastic tongue in cheek advice. Her writing style is brilliant and hilarious, I spent a lot of time giggling on the bus to it... I would highly recommend it :)
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app is really relaxing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I can't do anything else on my kindle while listening to the app. I would love to read a book and listen to the wonderful melodies. I still love this app, but I think they should be able to fix the problem.
B004MPR80E|5.0|This book is FANTASTIC - Mukherjee's writing style is poetic and lyrical even as he describes scientific facts, this book is thrilling and eye opening, and appealing to everyone, from lay person to medical graduate - the way that cancer has shaped our own social history as human beings is mind opening, and provides great insight into the  complicated disease.

B008BU70HW|5.0|Outstanding review of the British life of the wealthy and their service staff.  A great journey through the world of  Downton Abbey.
0689835604|5.0|My 12 month old loves books that has flaps that he can open and close and this book does not disappoint. In addition to the thrill of the flaps, the book also helps to teach baby parts of the body - hands, eyes, mouth, feet, etc. We read this book multiple times a day, so I'd say it's a hit!
B002BJGYTY|2.0|Bought as a christmas present.  Found out couple weeks after christmas the preson opened and started watching episodes and a disc was missing.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Excellent book to read - interesting, compelling and just a fun read ! Have not read one of his books that i didn't like yet.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This one is about as close to the real thing as you can get. The only problem I have with this one is you cant get enough bingo cards to play for a long period of time or play for an extended period of time. WE NEED MORE &#34;B&#34; CARDS or a way to get them over a small period of time
1455519006|5.0|A great read that's typical Baldacci. Super character development, keeps you on the edge of your seat, hard to put down!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Cool period piece done very well with terrific acting and a great structure to this thriller of a story. Entertaining.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It does what it's supposed to do, allows you to search for, purchase, and download mp3 music. Once you download a song on the cloud player it goes straight to your device, which is good because you dont have to go to the cloud player to play the song.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Really enjoyed this dramatic story that combines themes of love, drugs, crimes. family, morality and cultural influences. Wonderful cast of actors puts this near the top of classic drug movies.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I loved this book. It tells that Justin Bieber I  just an ordinary kid and loves what he does and that's truly special :)
B0045A8KY4|4.0|I love this movie.  It was a Chritsmas gift for a friend.  She and I are very satisfied with it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Anyone who loves Zeppelin NEEDS this.  Unless you were fortunate to have been at this show, this is the next best thing.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was awesome!! It had me on the edge of my seat. Rick Riordan is a talented writer and I can't wait for the next book.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I write this review for the game as it performs on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, running android jelly bean 4.1.1<br /><br />This is probably not the PvZ you've come to know and love, it plays more like an (extremely) lazy port.  First, it's been gutted in terms of content.  It's pretty much just the main storyline when it comes to game-play.  The games does not include any of the mini-games that unlock after completing the story.  While that's still a lot of content, it's not the full product people might come to expect.  Second, the graphics look pretty terrible for such a simple game.  Some sprites look vibrant and crisp (like the regular old peashooter), while others look horribly pixelated and blurred (the background, the zombies).  There are no graphics options to customize (i.e., aspect ratio, quality), and it will basically stretch to fill your screen.  This will more than likely leave you with distorted proportions, on top of already poor quality visuals.<br /><br />Bottom line, 3 stars because it will probably fill your PvZ cravings in a pinch.  For $2.99 though, the quality and content falls short.  You would have to be pretty bored to make it worth the price of admission.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|High praise for this app.  I use it for my default  alarms, and for daily time reminders. It's HIGHLY configurable, set the amount of snooze (or none), the the length of ring, anything you can think of is in the app. Great work Angle Labs!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I believe from the preview of this show would be different, was ok just not what I expected. I do recommend
0316212377|1.0|This is the least of the Culture novels, in which a space habitat based civilization of the far future survives its \\"post scarcity\\" existence by meddling in the affairs of everyone else in the galaxy.<br /><br />If you have never read a Culture novel, do not start with this one. Look at publication dates and start with one of the early ones. Banks was struggling to become established and had things to say. This book has nothing to say and no new ideas to explore.<br /><br />Yes, it's that annoying. I tried in vain to find any message in all the plotting of this book. Will religious purity lead a civilization to a rapture? Nope, the Gzilt are less pious than we are. Will success and maturity of institutions and personal achievement lead to a technological singularity in which our material world is no longer necessary or interesting? Nope, the Gzilt use the same technique as Dorothy in the wizard of Oz to get to their final destination. Is sublimation a huge scam in which civilizations are eaten by clever predators? I only wish there was so good a payoff after grinding through this book. Will the Culture finally get its ass kicked by a technological equal that isn't interested in being meddled with? We should be so lucky...<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Against a Dark Background\\", which also was about nothing but that explored a new and bizarrely detailed world. This book was a waste of time.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Good narrative on SEAL training and operations. However, this is one of several books that do the same. The actual operation to get Osama is a small part.
B00A6RVRXG|5.0|January of this year, a new Guided By Voices and a new Yo La Tengo.  HOORAY!  It's like 1995 all over again!
B00002N9ER|5.0|These mounting brackets allow you to lift your flashlight off of the mat, to hold itself high, to have a purpose again. These brackets are the &#34;Mickey&#34; Goldmill to your MagLight's Rocky Balboa.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started doing Jillian's workouts because I really don't enjoy the gym, I prefer doing my own workouts at home and on my time. I started doing this DVD last week, I'm still on Level 1. This DVD is tough but you can do it! The interval training is a proven method that I love - you don't get bored and you have to push yourself through. The DVD is split up into three Levels - 1,2 and 3. Each level contains three circuits and each circuit contains 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and a 1 minute of abs. The goal is to go through the workout that is a full 20 minutes WITHOUT stopping. I just now have gotten down to only taking two 5 seconds breaks and I\\"m super out of shape, so it really does help. I purchased 3 other Jillian DVDS after I got hers. I love them. You will see results if you do the exercises seriously, push yourself and keep up with it. I feel amazing, have so much more energy and my plan in the summer will be to start doing CrossFit training thanks to Jillian!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the beginning to the very end, the author grabs your attention and lets you feel all of the excitement, danger, and suspense of the Hunger Games!  You, too, will become entangled in the story of life, death, and young love.  Must read!  Can't wait to read the next addition of The Hunger<br />Games!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I think they did a very nice job updating this movie (updating a futuristic movie?  you know what I mean).  It was well done and I like the updates to the female hero and villain.  Well done and well worth a watch!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|24 hours is sometimes not enough to watch a movie, especially for us with lives busy enough that we shop online on sites like Amazon! I missed the last 10 minutes of this movie because my rent time expired! :-(<br /><br />The movie itself was great!
B006JP11HQ|5.0|This guy is the best. He really has a handle on the idea of limited government. I'm afraid he would be amazed at how far we have fallen into socialism since he passed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book, couldn't put it down! I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. It's a sweet love story with a heart wrenching back story!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is by far the best mahjong for kfire! I have been playing it for months and I am just now starting to get a bit bored of it. Worth the price.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|keep it on my kindle for my grandkids to play-and of course I do enjoy it too when they are'nt around
B00ARAO1LC|2.0|I thought this was a strange movie.  I Thought it would be better since Matthew McConaughey is in it, but I was wrong.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Just love the game enjoy it have for many years and always want to be able to play it in my spare time
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|I just love this cd; although I do not usually buy music by Mariah Carey, this was an exceptional buy for me.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter wanted this book for Christmas and it was one of the Flash Deals during the holiday season.  I got it for only $1.99.  A great deal and a great book!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I am not too tech savvy and this was easy to use and fun to play around with - would definitely recommend.
B00006I53S|3.0|I've used mine for several months now and it is a good/excellent and usefull addition to my bag. I go along with all of the good others have said about it with the exception of it being a good 'Walk About' lense. There are only 2 real drawbacks to this piece.<br /><br />First, like all other Canon lenses, the aperture specification numbers don't seem to be as advertised. The low aperture (largest @ 3.5) should probably be up a half stop to 4.0. This, you can live with and get adjusted to. It shouldn't be a deciding factor for you. Canon DSLR's are programed to work well with these aperature specs.<br /><br />Second is 'Lense Creep'. No matter how you carry this (on camera), whether neck strap, holster, or in hand, the telescoping barrel will extend out quickly, and without notice. That is until you bump it into something you thought you would not hit, or put the camera to your eye and have to reset (re-frame) the shot.<br /><br />You can live with 'Lense Creep', but to me, that's why it's not a 'Walk About' lense for me.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I searched and searched for a good quality case that was also purple.  This one sure does fit the bill.  It's very well constructed, the clips fit my Kindle Fire and don't block the speakers, the texture and feel of the outside is very nice and the color is beautiful.  You can prop it up horizontally but not vertically, which is OK with me since I only use it vertically to read and I like to hold it like a book.  I would highly recommend this case to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this at home & on my KF HD tablet. Works great. I love that you can set each reading plan you choose to send you a daily email of your reading plan for that day if you like. I also love that you can go to the reader, click play, and it becomes an audio book & reads it to you. Lots of reading plans & devotionals to choose from. Great app!
0811876373|5.0|This is the best cake pop book out there.  And it should be, since Angie is the one that came up with the original cake pop idea.  LOVE IT and would recommend to anyone that is interested in learning how to make pops.
0671449028|5.0|Grandson loves the book!  All the animals make him smile. Sandra Boynton's books are wonderful.  All the kids at school love them....
B000MRAAJM|5.0|These are so great to sit down and watch with the kids. They get to see all kinds of things and they really do get mesmerized by all the different creatures and locations.<br /><br />2 things:<br /><br />These are the ones narrated by Richard Attenborough, not the ones narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Not a big deal, but if you dont like or have a hard time deciphering English accents, be aware.<br /><br />Also, the voice seems a little buried in the audio track. To get the volume of the voice to be able to hear what hes saying, it makes all the other sounds quite loud.
0307463745|5.0|REWORK is a fantastic book. As an entrepreneur some of the book's unconventional thinking confirmed what I had already settled on through my own experience (experience seeing the failure of some common business thought, that is) and put it into clear verbiage for me to hang my hat on. Some other points encouraged my suspicions or cast light on truths that I just wasn't allowing myself to see or grasp. And, then, many other points enlightened me to new concepts and principles. Therefore, I believe this is a great read, and not just for people like me, but perhaps more so for people that are just getting started down the road of entrepreneurship. Finally, I found the small-bites approach to the content layout refreshing. As a busy person it's often impractical to try to fit in chapters of books that take 20 minutes to read. With REWORK I was able to read an entire chapter and grab a great concept for the day in about 5 minutes.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was a really good movie. I didnt expect it to be as good as it was. Im typically pretty skeptical about anything thats this hyped up. It deserved every bit of it. A really great ending to this era of the franchise.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Cute for my 2 year old granddaughter, she is mimicking her mother. Needs better looking characters. I would recommend this game.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I had seen this movie more than a few times, but always in standard definition. Watching this on BluRay made me realize just how good things can look.<br /><br />The movie itself is a truly great one. Even if youre not a big fan of action movies, you should really watch this movie with an open mind and see just how much crazy stuff they can do and make look so great.
B008RZF2I0|2.0|There aren't any memorable songs on this album. The lyrics have taken a step back and the songwriting is not what it was when Roy Khan headed the band. The best song on the album is Sacrimony, reminding me of an actual Kamelot song but it falls apart half way through. The rest are not really worth mentioning. Tommy Karevik is a good singer but not a great song writer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me so interested and wanting to keep reading. I had such a hard time putting the book down. Awesome read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Written in a different, interesting style.  This is one of the best mystery suspense novels I have read.  A battle of wits in an impossible situation.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|When I started Delirium I almost quiet reading it because it just didn't capture my interest. But the more I read the better it got and I didn't want to stop reading. Now I can't wait to read the second book.<br />Lauren Oliver is a fantastic author. I look forward to reading more of her books.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I have been waiting for this cd, when I received it I was very happy,since this is one of my favorite groups.  The songs are amazing and I will order from this company again.  They were very good at taking care of the problem that I had within days.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books. Would highly recommend you read all of Fifty Shades books. Great reading for anyone who enjoys good books.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After reading all the reviews I honestly expected more. I think it's ok, it's entertaining.<br />The first 6 chapters almost convinced me the book was written by a 12 year old. If you commit to read this book, I suggest you make it through the first 6 chapters.
B007T99ENE|3.0|McEwan is a very smart writer. He knows lots of things. Sometimes he balances these things he knows about with characters and situations so that the whole thing is great reading, like my favourite, The Child in Time. Other times, he lets his information take over, like in Solar, and in this one. Characters not particularly likeable or interesting, situations not particularly interesting. I could see what was coming for this girl, who took everything for granted and didn't think, from way back in the book, and I didn't really care when it all went to hell.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Beautiful settings, costumes and good old fashioned soap opera.  Great to pop in an episode on these cold winter nights when there is nothing to watch on TV .  Now the trick is to parcel them out and make them last!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is really cool and enjoyable for anyone who likes a good arcade game once and a while. This is definatly a game Id reccomend to a lot of peple. GET THIS APP TODAY!!!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie takes me back! I love this movie, it's fun, sexy and focused!!! I highly recommend this movie if you love rock and roll!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game to pass the time. some games are dumb but others you don't want to stop playing.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This is an amazing movie. A must see especially should be viewed by people who are closed minded and don't understand the importance of learning about things before judging them!!!! A must see!!!!
B0082GQ5HG|4.0|Nice version of animation. Some parts of the movie were geared toward an older age group but 5 year old really liked it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Wasnt sure what to expect but this game is totally worth  the money. You wont be dissapointed! Try it now!
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Good movie in the Ice Age series. Kids really enjoyed it. Pirates are a great addition to a good cast!
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I was very disappointed with this album.  From now on, I will not order any cd's unless first hearing them.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Well Thought out and fun to see! Certainly a nice new addition to the list of Christmas movies to see each year!
1466311649|3.0|The print in the book is VERY light and is hard to read and draw from but it worked for my class.
B00701897I|4.0|Nice movie, for older children and adults. Can't wait to see it in this movie in 3d. Just need a 3d TV now...
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Always liked him - since Hackers. He plays an emotionally stunted Sherlock perfectly and the plots are very interesting. Character development is a bit slow but it raises the audience's curiosity into his past. Not crazy about Lucy Lu - never smiles and is a bit too cold.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Without doubt best film 2012. After suffering through Argo, The Master, Les Miz etc, this film rises like the Sun to eclipse the late year nothing's. Treat yourself and your family to this great film. You' 'll be happy you did.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|An astonishing book, extraordinary writing and what an innovative plot! I could not put this down. And don't see the move before you read it.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I can finally listen to a radio station that I haven't been able to in years. Shins like my regular radio.
1609611543|4.0|The author is a talented writer and the narrator of the audio version made the book enjoyable to listen to.  I laughed aloud a few times.  I advise reading the book, researching the science and trying the diet.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Kind of technical in some respects, but very well written and interesting.  I would recommend this book for your reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun.  I like all the twists and turns of these adventures. I am a senior citizen and this is a great mind game to enhance my mind skills.  Love it
B002BI6SMI|4.0|A really good movie with a heart-tugging theme - a kidnapped child.  Too bad for the kidnappers the father is ex-special services with &#34;special skills&#34;.  This &#34;romp of revenge&#34; loses credibility when the bad-guys are felled by single karate chops and the father miraculously escapes machine gun fire, but the theme of relentless pursuit to retrieve your stolen child certainly resonates with this father of a teen. Looking forward to seeing Taken 2.  Neeson is perfect for this role!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this alarm is very helpful. it's great when I need to have an alarm set but am unable to use my phone alarm bc I am grounded haha! I love it!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I'm into forcing my 9 year old to watch movies from my youth. She enjoyed this one, but not as much as Little Shop of Horrors.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband and I play with it everyday. It is relaxing and helps talk your mind off your problems.  My 9 year old daughter love to play it, I think it is great that she like it, it works her brain. I would recommend to all ages
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Interesting movie.  It was well done.  You do get the impression at the end of the movie that nothing has really changed.  No great victory has been won, that - in fact - for Judge Dredd, this was just one more day, and no matter how exceptional it may see to us, it is a very ordinary day for him.  I think it is a very, very dark future portrayed, but it reminds me of the following passage from Patrick Devlin:<br /><br />\\"What is the relationship between crime and sin, between the Church and the Law?  I have spoken of the criminal law as dealing with the minimum standards of human conduct and the moral law as dealing with the maximum.  The instrument of the criminal law is punishment, those of the moral law are teaching, training, exhortation.  If the whole dead weight of sin were ever to be allowed to fall upon the law, it could not take the strain.  If at any point there is a lack of clear and convincing moral teaching, the administration of the law suffers.\\"<br /><br />This movie, while extreme, illustrates the  consequences of allowing the \\"whole dead weight of sin\\" to fall upon the law ... and the law alone.  It is a cautionary tale.
B00000I41J|4.0|I note that a couple of reviewers are unhappy with the sound of this CD transfer.  It didn't sound too bad to me, considering its age, but I take the point about some shrillness, especially in the trumpet high parts.  I think too that the timing is short measure for a CD, but I got it cheap, so I can't complain!  Otherwise, I loved it.  I got because I had been listening to a lot of the Grateful Dead and had come to the conclusion that it it is in some ways a jazz band.  So hell, I said, I'll try the real thing (my main interest is classical and opera).  I'm glad I tried it it -- this disc goes mellow beautifully, and it swings, though not too hard, appropriately.  Adderley's sax is a wonderful soulful sound, and Davis plays inventively and appealingly.  Hank Jones isn't featured as much as I might like, but he's a lucid and witty pianist.  The bass and drums are rock solid.  The whole thing is just a delight.  So why only four stars?  Mainly for the short measure.  This should have been combined with another recital.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|The Beanie Baby was perfect, but it was almost a week late arriving from the date we were promised. So it was a late Christmas present. I was not impressed with that.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I STARTED THIS GAME TWICE AND TWICE IT STOPPED AFTER ONLY PLAYING A LITTLE WHILE.  WHEN I WENT TO START THE SAVED GAME IT GOES BACK TO THE APP GAME ICON.  NOT WORTH 2.99.<br /><br />cnahrstadt@att.net
B005URRCUY|5.0|I find it hard to find modern music that I actually enjoy but The Black Keys are definitely an exception.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved it! It was so nice being 're -acquainted with the characters from Fall of the Giants,and watching their families grow. I can't wait for Book Three!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As always Rick Riordan did a wonderful job!The action and adventure was great!The only thing I disliked was how Piper thought of Percy. It made me forget about how strong,confident, and heroic Percy is and was. I was trying regain a sort of respect for Percy throughout the book and fully did that when he chose to be with Annabeth. Other than that I LOVED this book!!
0618871713|5.0|I am not a big fan of graphic novels as a rule. However, \\"Fun Home\\" totally blew me away and made a big time fan of the genre, possibly forever! This is an amazing book. Not only are the illustrations incredible, but the story that is told is so powerful and so tragic. Alison Bechdel is a brave writer. She puts it all there and shows her family for what it was (in her experience). The disappointments, the anger, the humor and, ultimate, the inability/unwillingness to connect. It's all here. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B0000029DD|5.0|What can anyone say -- simply a must have CD for anyone's collection.  I stumbled across this CD many, many years back and have never stopped listening to it since.  I'm sure I've played it a zillion times on my various mp3 players.  It's much better to listen to it as a whole work rather than the individual songs, so I usually play the full CD.  What a talent and what a tragedy.  How I wish I had seen him perform live.<br /><br />\\"Liliac Wine\\" is incredibly beautiful.  Many wonderful songs -- \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" -- \\"Grace\\" -- \\"So Real\\" and the best version of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" ever recorded.  I love his simple, straight forward guitar style, too.  Lots of nuanced touches to his playing that you notice more and more as you listen over time.  What a heartfelt performer he was.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor -- don't miss this -- it's a treasure.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This little manual for publishing Kindle ebooks is a great primer. Don't know what I'd have done without it. Too bad it's no longer available.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The basic plotline takes you one way but twists throughout the movie keep your attention. Good movie, plus Gordon-Levitt wasn't too bad to look at either

1449410243|5.0|My boyfriend bought this book for a friend and as he read it, he wished he wasn't gifting it. Noticing that he wanted the book for himself I ordered him a copy. When the book arrived I got halfway done when I had to run an errand. My little brother saw it and began to read it. He's 10 and he was also amused and entertained by the book. The book got passed around and everyone who read it absolutely loved it! Its a funny book and so is the poster that comes with it. I will eventualy gift the book once my parents return it. Its perfect for those with a sense of humor and anyone with a pet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a must read...dont pass it up. READ IT NOW!! I cant tell you how much this book moved me. It was fantastic.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|You just can't go wrong with any of the Ice Age movies. Very funny and heartwarming stories always. I always just love Scrat and his trials in getting his nut.

B004Y042N8|2.0|For what it is, the interface is good and the graphics are fine.  I slogged through 150 to see if there was any material increase in difficulty; there was not.  Hats off to anyone compulsive enough to complete all 1250.<br /><br />Generally, the puzzle' s concept seems lacking. The app's implementation seems about the best one could do with this concept.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|Does what it suppose to do, as clearing RAM, view running tasks etc., has handy and good looking interface. Love ES products.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|I bought the video, and received it within the same week. I bought it used.  However, it's well worth it.  The movie was very good.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Recommend this book to anyone who can deal with a 3book trilogy. Fabulous writing style and interesting characters. Bring on book 3!
B000003N7F|5.0|1. The recording:<br /><br />It is not enough to say this is a classic. It needs to be experienced.  This album will take you to another place, like meditation.<br /><br />Praise God for the one-, two- and three-star reviews, because at least these listeners opted to give this a try, even if they didn't fully experience it.  You don't need technical knowledge or expertise to appreciate this album.  Just sit down in a darkened room away from distractions, shut the door, close your eyes and listen.<br /><br />2. The vinyl:<br /><br />Get this record, and get it now!  With all of the flimsy, scratchy, substandard vinyl being churned out these days, the quality of this one is quite impressive.  This is a nice, sturdy vinyl that feels like it could have been picked up back in 1964.  The sound quality is warm and natural, perfect for this glowing album.  It's the way it was meant to be heard.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|yet again... another fabulous book by Murakami!<br />Shame there is not a forth installement - now i must make up my own ending :)
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought the G-155 GAEMS PGE along with the PS3 last month, and I must say, I've been having a blast! Not only does the G-155 provide sturdy protection for my PS3, but it enables me to play games without recourse to TV. And not to mention, the G-155 allows you to bring your game console everywhere without needing to worry about whether your destination would have a TV, etc. That, and games look beautiful on the screen (which has limited viewing angles, but that's not too much of a problem, as long as you sit directly in front of it).<br /><br />I do have a concern, though: will the GAEMS fit in a plane's overhead luggage compartment? I've read somewhere that it is possible to bring the PGE into a plane, but I want to make sure because I intend to bring it with me to college soon.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story line was excellent and addicting. I didn't wanna put it down and can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|I got this based on the fact I really like the show Life the man was in before which got canceled. This is just straight pornography 30 min in the first episode and that was too much for me I should have stopped after his wife was in the bed with his best friend but after I skipped past that I thought it would get better 2 sex scenes and at least 3 f words in 30 min something no one's mind needs to see. Not just not for families not for adults either. I realize I should have done more checking before I got this movie and that was my fault. This is just a word of warning to anyone else out there that is concerned about what they let in their mind.
0553386794|4.0|This is the first fantasy work i have reading quite a while (due to 4+ years of University). Loving the many plotlines, and the realism shown by a thousand shades of gray- there are no clear \\"good guys, bad guys\\"- just many who cleave more or less closely to what they say and believe their values are, much like real life. I love how it is told thru multiple characters view points as well, and this DEFinitely heightens the suspense factor!<br /><br />All that being said, i must recommend the series \\"Book of the New Sun\\" by Gene Wolfe (4 parts) for those who may not be familiar with it already. Not only the best SF/fantasy i have ever read (and i read a LOT when i was younger, particularly!)- far better than Tolkien- but some of the best Literature i have read, period; it really makes you think deeply about life's biggest questions. I have read Ursula K. LeGuin yet but have had her very highly recommended by many friends.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I'm not a knife expert, but I get a better edge on a camping/hunting knife with sandpaper attached to a drill or dremmel than with this. The diamond sharpener file does work well for the serated edges on the back of a hunting knife, or a tree saw knife, but wore out my hands while sharpening. The value of this sharpener is probably out in the field when you don't have power tools and you need to resharpen something.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Like other successful Clancy projects he grips you early and you can't let go.  Laced with scenarios that have face validity in todays world, the reader has to stop  and think about whether they are reading a fictional book or a newspaper story.  An enjoyable read with our favorite characters.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I've never read the Harry potter series so I had nothing really to go with her writing style. My boyfriend kept harping on me to read Harry potter but I refused because I've already seen the movies. So, naturally I'm pretty excited to read this book once I downloaded it. However, the first couple of pages I felt like she kept jumping around too much. I understand the background information needs to be made, but after reading the first 50 pages of the book, i put it down. I've had enough. This book just couldn't hold my attention. Maybe I will give this book another try here in a month or so, but right now....I have no desire.
B00866JL96|5.0|Who knew Zac could act? This is a great story about love, sacrifice, and lost. Beautifully told and tenderly acted. I loved this story!!! FIVE STARS!

B009JBZH54|4.0|This trilogy collection was made for money making only. It is literally the movies, special features for 2 & 3, and a little booklet with photos and quotes and little stuff. It was made and put out before Christmas to get some easy money. Another set is coming out in 2013 that will be the \\"collector's edition.\\" More will be put into it, like better cover, better set that the DVD's/Blu rays come in, and I believe even more features and discs than just the movies. This will hold you over if you just want the movies, but wait until the REAL collection comes out!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! Best book I've read in awhile! It was weird and inventive enough to keep me hanging on!!
B005LAII80|1.0|This is a all on one disk and not a 3 disk set as it would lead you to think. I buy sets because the DVDs get used everywhere and by everyone including grand kids and I would not pay this for one disk it does not make sense.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A good read for those who have doubts.  As one of those people, the experience of a doctor who was not particularly religious resonated with me.

0470474874|3.0|The book gives a great overview of the basics.  I have not completely read all the content of the book.  I was looking for some advanced tips which is why the book scored 3 stars with me.  If you no nothing about Excel 2010 it is a great book for getting you up to speed on this program.<br /><br />The book was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What a wonderful, well-done  series. I can't wait to see season 3! I would recommend it to anyone. Good show!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Dredd was a very good movie considering its budget and size. What Dredd does well is its balance of the characters and the action. The chemistry of Dredd and Anderson was top notch; with Anderson being the perfect counter balance to Dredd stern personality. As the movie progressed, the development of Anderson felt appropriate considering the events that embedded her. Although the story line was as basic, that was all the movie needed. Being the first movie(and a character I've never heard of) it did a great job of introducing the environment and characters as a first movie should. The action in the movie stolel the show. The slow motion effects were all appropriate and done at the right times. Seeing a bullet entering a bad guy in slow motion was gruesome but awesome. The only shortcomings of the movie was they should have invested more time developing Mama. At times Mama felt more like an obstacle than a villain. When Mama did get screen time, she was cold and demeaning. Dredd does a lot of great things that a introductory movie should do and would love to see a franchise made from this.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|In the begining the movie was very funny but after a while it became boring and draged out to long.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I gave this game 4 stars because it's a good time passing game. It's easy to play. The graphics are good. The settings and stats are a nice feature too.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to take a mind break from time to time.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO TONY SING FOR OVER SIXTY YEARS AND SO NATURALLY I HAD TO HAVE THIS DVD. HE HAS A NICE ASSORTMENT OF ARTISTS PERFORMING WITH HIM AND I THINK IT ONLY SHOWS HOW GOOD HE CAN STILL BE AND AT HIS AGE, THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING. IF YOU ENJOY TONY SINGING, YOU WILL LIKE THIS DVD AS WELL. THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF AMY WINEHOUSES LAST PERFORMANCES.
B002BNKQDK|5.0|This gorgeous piece  is absolutely accurate like appears in Watchmen movie.<br /><br />Is made in robust material.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied for this purchase.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a story about an astronaut stranded on Mars and how he survives until he can be rescued. The  author must be in the space industry. His character gets stranded on Mars. He must find way way to survive until he gets rescued.  The story's main character is so well developed you believe you are actually there with him. His technical knowledge on what it is like to be that astronaut is crucial to his survival. If you are looking for a book that is so unlike all others, then this is for you. You are left guessing to the very end if he will make it ! I would have given this book ten stars if Amazon allowed it.
0671449028|4.0|Cute book. Pictures are colorful. My 17 month old son enjoys it. It's a good size for little toddler hands.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I've never really been a \\"reader\\" until I started using my Kindle app. I've also never been one to read a harlequin type book. I read this is just a few days, very easy read that keeps you wanting more. I was drawn in & just kept turning pages. I would recommend this book to others.
B009MO5960|1.0|I only bought it for the collection. I swear Paul W.S. Anderson must've wrote the story and screenplay on a roll of toilet paper because this movie ain't good for nothing but wiping my butt with. No story. No dialogue. No sense. No excuse for this lazy piece of crap. We as fans deserve better and Mr. Anderson name the sequel one of only two name. Resident Evil: Redemtion or Resident Evil: The Apology.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Always a fan of historical fiction and Ken Follett, I was not disappointed with this book.  Love the way he interwove the lives of families in different parts of Europe, as well as the USA, making the story so much more meaningful.  Looking forward to the rest of the Trilogy.
B009AOFNU4|5.0|This is amazing.  I pair it with my Sony S tablet, Emulators, Bluetooth Jambox and now I have a portable SNES gaming machine.  It may seem small of a controller, but my large hands appreciated the perfect positioning of all the buttons.  It's portable, holds a charge forever, pairs easily to my tablet and the best part?  My girlfriend is hooked playing Dr. Mario using this controller ONLY.  she gets to bunch her tiny hands all over it, and Im able to play Ghouls n Ghost with ease.<br /><br />Nothing beats this controller since it fits in my pocket, and any small pockets in my laptop bag.<br /><br />Pricey, but I got it as a gift and would recommend it to anyone who was serious about portable gaming.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Very interesting book.  I kept thinking there could be a happy ending, but of course, there wasn't.  I'm not sure how I felt about her &#34;blaming&#34; 13 people for her suicide, but it was interesting nonetheless.  Some of it was a stretch and at times I was confused because there were SO many names involved.  Overall, I enjoyed it (if you can enjoy a book on this topic)  It was a unique idea and definitely had a unique perspective.
B000000XB9|5.0|i love this CD on this on this some of the songs are. lodi, proud mary, susie Q and many more wonderful songs.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  It kept me guessing the whole time!  I really enjoyed how it switched perspectives.  The ending was peculiar.  I got myself out of bed at 11:45 (I couldn't put it down!) to &#34;Google&#34; what the ending meant.  It doesn't seem that many people enjoyed the ending and I'm still not totally clear as to what is really meant.  Maybe that was the point of it, though.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|My daughter loves this cd, which I purchased as a gift for her.  It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  If you like Phillip Phillips, you'll enjoy this cd which is very much HIS music.
B008Y67LEK|4.0|FINALLY this book was available for Kindle!  I have been looking for a copy of this book for a very long time (locally).  It was incredibly interesting and after finishing it found myself &#34;Googling&#34; for more information about her life.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I consumed this book in one weekend.  that is my marker for a great book, one that I crave to read when away from it, perching my kindle on the window sill while doing dishes, etc.
B001F12J0C|5.0|My family enjoyed watching all three of these thrillers.  I have seen bits and pieces over the last few years, but to sit and watch each one till the end was very exciting.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I've read the others in the Cousins' War series and loved them! This one sounded repetitive at times but was still a good read
B00441GYZQ|5.0|Harrison Ford has always been my favorite actor.  Like Sean Connery, the older he gets, the more handsome he becomes.  I love all his movies and had not seen this one in a long time.  It was almost like watching for the first time.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a genre that has been done many times. From Caprica to Snowcrash to countless movies and books. But Ernest Cline created such a rich, detailed world. Such a good protagonist. Such a good story.<br /><br />+1

B00A80SHFM|5.0|The most moving music of the century.  This musical brought me to a place in my life that I haven't been in a very long time!  And when the DVD comes out, I will add it to my library.
0385474547|2.0|Good
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I had this downloaded for all of about 1 hour, before I removed it. It was terrible. It didnt load the news feed well, and if you opened anything and went back it would start you back at the top again, and when pushing things like photos or profiles it would only acknowledge your choice by the top of the page, so mostly I opened a LOT of cover photos... repeatedly. I found that its much easier to just view it in the browser

B005F9CPG8|5.0|My grandson who is 11 has absolutely Loved the Beatles for quite awhile now.  So for Christmas I purchased this for him and he loved it.
B00ANT6OK8|4.0|If this were a James Bond movie, it would be the best one ever! Gritty, realistic, non-cartoon violent, with the absolute worst villain in the world, one to make Goldfinger and Dr. No and all the other would-be world-rulers in the Bond canon seem tame by comparison.  Tragically, however, this is not a Bond movie - and the events depicted are cold, hard fact, not fictional fantasy. ZERO DARK THIRTY reveals the world of espionage and covert operations and international intrigue in a brutal, realistic light - and offers up a gripping vision of just how dangerous and cut-throat and intense and tense that world actually is...and how Bondian cartoon heroics and impossible physical feats are truly silly in the long run and quite unneeded in creating edge-of-the-seat excitement such as that to be found herein.  However, a Bond film once had the upper hand as far as cinema verite goes in the depiction of torture. The torture and enhanced interrogation scenes depicted in this film are lightweight compared to the B-Busting of Bond in CASINO ROYALE. Ouch! I, myself, almost couldn't get out of my seat after watching that! Anyway, the scenes of water-boarding, some stress positions and a dog collar in ZERO DARK THIRTY are causing a firestorm of outrage.  Yet post 9/11 necessitated the extreme.  If just one plot could have been foiled due to information received via coercive actions, then more power to the thumbscrews.  Sometimes...one simply has to fight fire with fire. Hindsight is always 20/20 and outrage afterwards is always easy.  And the jury is still truly out as to just what was learned or not learned via those enhanced interrogations.  There are two or more sides to every story.<br /><br />Spoilers!  As a movie, ZERO DARK THIRTY's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. So then, the Good: One scene of a bombing at a Marriott Hotel caused a collective jump in the audience and succeeded all too well in simulating what such an actual experience might be like.  (I read in a book recently about the terror attack on a nightclub in Bali - and how some young woman that a guy was just talking to was, after the fireball, found by the same guy sliced in two at the waist.  When I read that one savage fact alone - one out of thousands upon thousands - I wept and I knew in my heart and in my gut why enhanced interrogation was an option still on the table.)  Another scene wherein our agents were set-up for a suicide bombing was equally powerful. Tearfully so. And the depiction of the raid on the Abbottabad compound was absolutely brilliant.  Someone elsewhere said that it was so realistic that we could have been watching the real deal.<br /><br />Weaknesses?  The Bad?  The constant character of Maya (who is, I understand, an amalgam of several such women) began to seem a bit too fictional after awhile.  I perfectly understand the dramatic reasons for having her tie things together, but all-in-all she made one appearance too many for my money.  After all, other key characters came and went throughout the course of the long film, why not Maya as well?  Her being the female \\"Bond\\" character in this film somewhat hindered the realistic propulsive movement of the historicity of the piece. The story didn't really need one single person to thread it all together for us. And as some others have noted, Maya is not developed enough as a character to be that continual thread. There is also power in numbers - and I think that \\"Maya\\" would have worked better dramatically if \\"she\\" were a group instead of an individual. Another weakness was an overemphasis on the tracking of the courier without having a more balanced depiction of the time and energy that went into the planning of the actual raid.<br /><br />And the Ugly?  That any of this ever happened.  That we live in a world unhinged, a world where hatred and intolerance can so maddeningly blind so many into never being able to see our common humanity, never seeing that Life is far better than Death and that Loveis, ultimately, all we truly need.is, ultimately, all we truly need.
B002JVWRAY|4.0|the family enjoys this show.  It is not a favorite one, but we are sci-fi nuts<br />arounf here and we wanted to make sure we did not miss any episodes
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Installed a mini ITX board, DVD drive and four hard disks. There is l a lot of room for expansion and the tool-less drive bays make it a breeze to pre-fit components.<br />Will hold six 3.5&#34;drives and two 2.5 inch drives as well as three 5.25&#34; drives. The large fans have external switches to control fan speed.  With three 3.5&#34; disks and one 2.5&#34; disk this case runs very cool and extremely quiet.<br />Highly recommended!
B0017K8X5Q|5.0|Most cases have mounts for either 92mm or 120mm fans, however there are certain cases (pun intended) that need to cool a set of hard drives with little to no room to do so. This product is a great addition to those specific applications where a 12mm thick fan would help provide air flow.
0525478817|5.0|I love this book. It was very interesting and enjoyable. I highly recommend this to anyone that is in for a good read.

B009IF7V2S|4.0|This one is a classic for me. Great cast and a fun story make it a go-to when your just looking for something to watch.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|at first seemed easy & boring, as the levels increase it gets very addicting. only downside is touch screen causing pipes to cross when you arent supposed to, but thats me, not the game
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I'm a definite Pixar fan. This one is pretty good though not on the same level of The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. The characters are great and the animation is the best in the business as usual. The story didn't quite grab me as some of the other Disney/Pixar films have.
B00005BKZJ|3.0|This film is snail slow but interesting. Watching misfits find connection with other misfits kept me going. CCH Pounder is the spark of attitude needed to keep you awake.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|I really enjoy animated movies. I also enjoy Tim Burton's style. His movies though are starting to feel like each one is the same story with different characters. Don't get me wrong the movie was okay and the animation was fantastic and I certainly enjoy the Halloweenesque genre but this one left me wanting more.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is such a great app.  I am always wondering the name or title of a song & this tells you very quickly!

B0067TQQI8|4.0|I purchased this several weeks ago to provide juice for my iPhone 4s when I'm backpacking.  I was looking for a reasonably priced, lightweight, durable unit that would provide me with three to four complete recharges.  While I haven't had a chance yet to take it into the backcountry, so far it appears to be exactly what I was looking for.  I have had the Anker through two complete charge and recharge cycles and it looks like it will in fact be able to provide me with three to four complete recharges.  With the phone on using the 2A port it can take my phone from completely dead to 100% charged in a little over two hours.  Charging the Anker from completely dead using a wall outlet takes approximately six to seven hours.  I would have given this unit 5 Stars, but I think the verdict is still out on how durable it will be, since I haven't yet taken it into the backcountry.  Also, when it arrived the silver housing on top of the unit where the charging ports sit was not quite flush.  It appeared as if it had either not been completely snapped together during assembly or it had been handled roughly when it was shipped.  But, it snapped right back together and I haven't had a problem with it since, which leads me to what really sold me on this unit.  From reading the reviews of the people who did have problems, and there weren't many, the seller seemed to offer outstanding service.  Couple that with an 18 month warranty and I was sold.

0062127241|5.0|As a life long Who fan I was glad when I saw that Pete Townshend wrote his autobiography and even more glad to see that he read it for the audio version.<br /><br />I listened to the audio over the last several weeks and found it excellent in explaining what Townshend was going through when writing his music and plays/movies. I did think he should have said more about his bandmates - ie. he brings up a serious issue Daltry was having and then drops it altogether, then later brings up financial problems Entwhistle was having and again, drops them without update.<br /><br />Okay, but it was Townsend's autobiography so he did stay on topic. I found him profoundly honest - sharing more than I would expect, and very insightful. He was kind to everyone he worked with so he didn't use this to dish on people. He was even perhaps too kind to his wife - whom he stayed with way too long imo. She wasn't happy with him being a rock star although she married him while he was a rock star. She was miserable from practically the beginning and tells him she doesn't love him.  He finally cheats with anyone who so much as likes him, goes on drugs, drinks and doesn't want to go home - which he feels guilty about. Then after decades he divorces her and finds happiness. This seems to be what frees him.<br /><br />It was a good, interesting listen. The marriage part was painful.  I think the only thing this is missing is more on his band mates, they must have played a bigger part in his life. Roger Daltry is practically omitted altogether. We get no insight into their relationship. The most we hear about is Keith Moon and then it's a small amount.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|This tale deals with a boy in 1950s India who finds God in many forms and is then persuaded by his father during a violent incident with a Bengal Tiger that God does not quite exist as suspected. Years pass and then when he loses his entire family aboard a sea vessel and that he's stranded on a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger that he once again \\"sees\\" God in many forms.<br /><br />What follows is up to your opinion. Some would call it a spiritual journey and others would name it a massive hallucination to deal with the loss of his family and the horrors he faces. The beauty of this film is that either interpretation is correct. Too often these types of films pick one solid belief and then fight for it at the expense of other interpretations.<br /><br />Yes, that nasty chef was Gerard Depardieu.<br /><br />If you want something different yet engaging this is worth the price of admission but be warned it drags a bit in the middle hence my not so perfect grade for STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING.<br /><br />Pay attention to the very ending or you're going to miss a very important point or two about the entire film.<br /><br />Based on a best-selling novel by Yann Martel this picture had a budget of $120M and as of this writing has made over $451M in the theaters.<br /><br />The Golden Globes awarded this film Best Score and nominated it for Best Picture and Best Director and Best Motion Picture --- Drama. The Academy Awards (who have yet to issue their awards as of this writing) nominated it for, well, almost everything: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound Editing, Production Design, Sound Mixing, Visual Effects, Original Score and Original Song.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; THEMES/FOCUSES: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013 (at the movies).

B001AQO3QA|4.0|I only saw a couple of the Alien movies and so it was good to re-see them all. The extra disk (one I have no idea what it was for) but the other extra disk was excellant as the directors and actors talked for over an hour and a half about EACH of the movies. It did drone on but was very interesting to hear about all the problems with management, technology ect. that they encountered when making these movies. I came away with the impression that I felt I could really understand why Hollywood actors/actresses are anti-business after seeing some of the BS that they have to put up with in making a movie. Course, this is their side of the story.

When I saw the Zoom, I thought this would be perfect, and it is!  We can actually play with two players without having to back all the way up to our couch.  Such a difference.
B006G2124E|5.0|love the movie, but book was better! Still a great purchase and will recommend reading the book before watching the movie
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a really good book. The plot was great. It made it where I can't wait to see the movie. Also I think everyone should read this book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I am very glad I got this game, the music is just amazing, the theme is intriguing and I just love it! It can get challenging, but it is still pretty fun, plus, it would be boring without at least a little challenge!

B005K17RU0|5.0|I am liking this app. Fast, clear, COLORFUL screens of info. and maps. I can check on the weather in multiple pre-saved locations (other cities, states,  and countries) with a few taps of my screen. I am using it throughout the day. Weather changes, alerts, and areas of precipitation, and so much more. Thanks.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It gives you a challenge yet hooks you in so that you just keep on playing.
1608871517|5.0|Its presentation, the quality of its print and the paper,  and the photographs make it a nice book. The text presents interesting facets of Michael Jackson personality that add to his understanding as an artist. I would recommend the book to someone who is curious to know who Michael Jackson was.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|To someone who isn't a follower of the Alien movies, this is a pretty good film on its own.<br /><br />Since I've followed the alien's since they were introduced to me by Ridley Scott in 1979, I was looinking at this film with a more skeptical and critical eye.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into details or write a lengthy review.I just want to say that the movie didn't exactly pick up where are the other ones left off and the movie also left a lot of questions unanswered.<br /><br />That said, I guess we have more movies to look forward to from Ridley Scott in  the Alien series
B001CEE1YE|5.0|I'm not necessarily an action movie fan, but I do like Keanu Reeves.  He's one of those actors who have longevity and should be<br />around for a long time.  I had a hard time following some of the story - I felt lost in many areas, but overall, it was a good story.  I<br />found that I did have to think about this movie more than I like to.  When I have to do that it takes away from the pure enjoyment<br />of a movie which is what I really want, but it has Keanu Reeves in it and that's what is necessary.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|The characters had depth.  As you read it feels like you really come to know them.  However, the ending is anticlimactic.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Even as an adult I have really enjoyed this movie since it came out.  Bought it for my kids, but who cares?  Love the story, the<br />voices of the characters and the beautiful colors.  AND you don't have to think about it - just watch and get a kick out of it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved this book!  I can't wait for the next book in the trilogy! It was so exciting that I couldn't put it down.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Unless you need seriousness to your stories, this is a great series to get caught up in.  I love all the characters and I love the<br />relationship between Arthur and Merlin.  It has humor and a serious side.  The development of the characters has progressed<br />over the seasons and they are more likeable now than ever.  I don't like to think of this series ending after the 5th one, but I<br />will purchase that DVD when it is available and will then enjoy them all over and over again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Although this book kept me page turning, I didn't like the ending. I went from hating Nick, one of the main characters, to hating Amy, the other main character. Then when I realized that she was crazy, I just wanted her to get locked up, especially when she murdered her old boyfriend. I didn't like how Amy cornered Nick into staying with her. This book reminded me of a typical Lifetime movie.
B008133DO8|5.0|This show became the reason i loved amazon prime. I love this show, as having been to london a few times and love it for all its history and charm, i just love this new update to a classic. its soooo well done. the first episode of season two is brilliant and kept me guessing and i loved it! loved it!
0062124293|1.0|Read this with my book club - a group of strong, independent, intelligent women - and we all hated it. All of us. While we all consider ourselves to be feminists - even strident feminists as Ms. Moran asks us to be - we found that this book really went to the sort of extremes that gives the term \\"feminist\\" a bad name in many circles. Encouraging women to taste their own menstral blood? Really? Disgusting and downright absurd is all I have to say about this trash.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a great read. Quirky and made me want to have their life. Read it!!! Now. Go! Yes.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great read and make one want to finish the series.  Action packed book that goes along with the series great.  A must read.

0547258305|4.0|Graceling is a young adult fantasy novel set in a world of seven kingdoms in which some are born with \\"Graces\\" --an extraordinary, innate skill of one sort or another. The protagonist, Katsa,seems to be Graced with the gift of killing. The plot is well-summarized in other reviews, so I'll skip that.<br /><br />While Katsa and her friend, Po, travel across most of the seven kingdoms in this story, the real journey is Katsa's growth from lonely, mistrustful tool of another's bidding into one who comprehends the nature of her gift and of love--not simply romantic love, but familial and even a quasi-maternal love as well. Cashore has created an amazing world with easily-believed characters. Katsa's motivations are clearly communicated throughout and her personal growth feels organic.  I was impressed that Cashore kept me deeply involved in the story even as Katsa's battles reached Matrix-movie levels of incredible .<br /><br />This story also works on another level for young adult readers (or those who haven't managed to block out those years). Alienation, loneliness, a feeling of being either special (on a good day) or downright freakish (on most other days) are feelings that I very much remember from my own adolescence. Katsa's resentful awareness of the bitter unfairness of the distribution of power and determination to undermine Randa's petty cruelty (and to later overthrow the true villain's deeper, more chilling evil) are all themes that resonate strongly with my memories of being a much younger girl awakening to the fact that Life! Isn't! Fair! (Cue door slam and bitter, angst-flavored tears.)<br /><br />As a parent, I would happily hand Graceling to either of my daughters when they're at the appropriate age to read it. There is some (not overly explicit) sexual activity as well as inferences--some more subtle than others--that women and children weaker than Katsa (so...all of them) face the risk of abuse. There is also a lot of violence (which probably should have been clear from the fact that the title character has the gift of killing.) As such, I wouldn't want my 8 year old to read it, but I'd be happy to recommend it when she's a bit older and more prepared to comprehend and process these topics.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie makes me so happy. My teenage sons love it, too! And they didn't want to like it. But they laughed a lot!
0765325950|2.0|I wanted this book to be good so bad. After reading it, I was somewhat content to have an ending of any sort, but the more I contemplate it the more I realize just how much of a mess this last book was. I'll try to express my main criticisms with the story in the following review. This review will be absent of spoilers, which does limit my ability to fully express my critiques.<br /><br />My biggest issue with Sanderson's writing is dialog. All of the conversations come off as very canned and lack substance. It's as if every character has the exact same thought process and reasoning. I've heard it said that all of Sanderson's characters are White Ajah and that is an accurate summation of how the dialog is treated. In The Gathering Storm and Towers of Midnight we saw this same approach, as there are several conversations that are done in a very logical fashion where one character presents some basic argument for their point and the other characters eat it up. This comes off as very false to me as characters will often abandon long held convictions after a few minutes of conversation. There's no depth or emotion, it's just a gloss over that allows the writer to advance the story. It's through this approach with the dialog that several characters lose their voice. Mat continues to be written poorly by Sanderson, as his humor is often forced through ridiculous dialog that is out of character for him. Mat used to be my favorite character and in the Sanderson books he has been morphed into a cartoon version of himself. Due to several characters losing what I perceive to be their true voices, their fate in this book lost conviction with me. I felt nothing for several pivotal characters as they faced extraordinary circumstances or even death.<br /><br />Another major issue I have with Memory of Light is the battle mechanics. The battles and tactics don't make any sense and several details are skipped entirely. The most prevalent example of this occurs early in the books when one of the armies of the Light draws a trolloc army to charge them with the goal of leading them 250 miles towards another army waiting in ambush. This is completely inconsistent with the abilities of trolloc armies in the past. There is no way that a human army could stay in front of a trolloc army and act as a harrying force for 250 miles. They would be overrun. Even ignoring this issue, the writer does not touch on this transition at all. The armies are in one place on one page and then 250 miles away a few pages later. The ridiculousness of this tactic is amplified as they end up kiting this trolloc army halfway across the continent for a reason that still remains unknown to me. Another issue with the battles is the complete change in the power of channelers. In previous books, Rand and a few channelers were able to destroy armies of Shadowspawn in mere minutes. In Memory of Light, tens of thousands of trollocs are able to overwhelm the forces of the Light for days on end. It's very confusing why they don't engage their channelers more. We see no use of large circles by the armies of the Light and the deployment of channelers is confused in ineffective.<br /><br />The story as a whole taken at an outline view is excellent. I enjoyed the conclusion and how it was handled. However, it's the details that make this book a frustrating read. It lacks substance, effective dialog, and well thought-out battle plans to fully engage the reader. Most of the book is comprised of individual 2-3 page point of views that don't provide enough substance to gain their appropriate weight. This might have been done to expand the number of characters touched upon or perhaps increase the sense of chaos, but I did not enjoy this writing style. The ending epilogue is quite rushed as well. I would have preferred more fleshed out ends to the main character threads over hundreds of pages of confusion battle details. All in all, I'm happy to see an end of the series and know the conclusion. It's absolutely tragic that Robert Jordan couldn't finish the series. Any fan of the series that has set out on the path of reading the Wheel of Time owes it to themselves to read this last book. However, I can't say that it's a well-written novel...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read, well written, incredible story.  A must read for those who want to know more about the mission to capture Bin Laden

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really good read.  A little bit OMG at times but it was entertaining!!  Read all three books and would read another if she writes anymore.
B004UID2LC|5.0|That is how this thing works. Quickly and accurately every time. I have never had a problem downloading. Fully satisfied.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really good read.  A little bit OMG at times but it was entertaining!!  Read all three books and would read another if she writes anymore.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Fantasy plot line that blends medieval setting with politics and good versus evil. Good acting. It has an interesting story line with no major twists (as yet). If you like intrigue you will like this. Would be 'R' or ‘X’ rated if it were a movie. Contains sex and violence. Series is not done yet. Season three is now being created. Books were good too.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|It was a great read, and great to see Rebus back in the driving seat of his old Saab. Rankin's love for the old character is easy to see, the story flows well and comfortably, even when he meets the 'new kid on the block', Malcolm Fox, it's obvious which character Rankin prefers.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for Rebus fans, try not to read it too fast, savour the sights and sounds of Rebus's Edinburgh, maybe it's his last drive around the block?
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always, a wonderful story about love. Sparks can make you fall in love with the characters very easily. It also feels like a true story, that it could happen just this way.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The Racketeer was better than I expected. Recent Grisham books have been missing the magic of the originals, but The Racketeer is closer to the old style. There are plenty of twists and turns, and the ending is a mystery right up until the last chapter.<br /><br />If there is any shortcoming then maybe the story is a bit far fetched, or a stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />But it's a good read, a page turner that will keep you entertained.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What a great way to tie all three books together.  If you haven't read the first two books, this one will be a bit confusing.

B000FBFN1U|3.0|I am just starting to catch up with the stories again.  Perhaps I had too long a layoff between books but I have been grateful for the demise of some of the key characters only because I am losing track of the stories while trying to keep up with the characters.<br /><br />I also believe I have to find a handy reference for the terms and titles.<br /><br />I think that all three of the series which I have read so far are worth a re-read (and may require it), but I also believe they are not as worthy of being reread as say &#34;One Hundred Years of Solitude&#34; which is a single volume.<br /><br />I suppose it isn't fair to compare jrr.Martin to G.G.Marquez is it.
0937381888|5.0|I love this book! Very helpful and easy to understand. I bought this book a few years ago and loan des to a friend. I bought it again for him on Christmas so that I could get mine back with my notes in it.  Now that I have been brewing for a few years I use it as more of a reference.

B008M36EEI|1.0|One star is too much. The only feeling that all those good actors could transmit was the embarrassment of being involved in that movie . I hope that they donated their earnings to charity...in that case I give 5 stars. The only good part was the ending, because it happened.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|starting to be too much of same thing but the plot still hold my attention.  I have a hard time believing there is another book after this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good series.  This one to me, was very sad. I look forward to the next two movies.  Now to find another good book to read.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|this was a funny book but got boring in parts. I bought it because I like Tina but I think she is much better actress than writer.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|More than a story of magic,it is also a story of love. I enjoyed the idea of magic and the love story was a gift.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Read the book, but the movie was great. Changed the story to fit the medium but it worked very well. Tim Burton added his signature flare.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Harder to read than the first two. I LOVED the story but got tired of the insane amount if background that was given about minor char... it slowed down the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A good story with a bit of twist but at times I found the love scenes a bit too lovey ,dovey.Still I enjoyed the book and would recommend it
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album is just some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. It's magical, lyrical and just plain beautiful. I highly recommend this album/artist to everyone.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Say what you will about Roman Polanski, its probably all true. But he understood MacBeth -- the play whose title none dare speak while in production --  understood how dark and subversive a play it is down at its core, and understood how to present the play to a modern audience while retaining its original setting.<br /><br />Produced following Rosemary's Baby and the death of his spouse Sharon Tate in the Tate-La Bianca murders, the film loses none of its impact since its release. Elements from these two events informed the stark atmosphere of this version. What made Rosemary's Baby such a spine-tingling thriller was Polanski's ability at transforming seemingly ordinary events or people into pure evil. Here, rather than presenting the play in stilted, theatric, posturing, Polanski translates the dialogue as it would have occurred in an ordinary setting. There are plenty of supernatural elements to this version. These elements are brilliantly presented as the result of MacBeth's natural ambition, not supernatural at all.  The close proximity to the Tate-La Bianca murders certainly contributed to the graphic depictions of killings and violence which permeates the film. Some reviewers have taken issue with these portions of the film. However, life in Mediaeval Scotland was indeed \\"brutish, nasty and short,\\" as well depicted in his version.<br /><br />Watch Polanski's version of MacBeth and you'll never look at this play the same again.

When I got it, the case had a little bit of flaws and the movie was scratched a little, but it didn't effect me from watching the movie all the way through without it skipping. I would recommend the company I bought this movie from!

B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I *love* Tina Fey, but I didn't love this book. Some good sections (about her dad) but in general, rather jumpy. Didn't learn as much as I expected. The Sarah Palin sections were great, and I loved reading about her climbing her way up through her first job and through comedy. Overall, I was disappointed.

0307950654|2.0|P.D. James's Jane Austen pastiche, Death Comes To Pemberley, doesn't succeed, either as a 19th century novel of manners or as a mystery. The best I can say for it is: nice try.<br />The man on trial for his life is Wickham, a scoundrel Austen fans already know and dislike from Pride And Prejudice. If anything, we'd like Wickham to be either murdered or hanged, freeing his wife to marry someone more solid and likable, and freeing Darcy and Bingley of an unwanted obligation. Compounding this error, instead of writing from the suspect's viewpoint, James writes from Darcy's. We're not interested in Darcy! His character was fully developed (writers would say, completed its arc) in Pride And Prejudice. How much more interesting this book would have been, had the murdered man been Wickham and the man on trial Alveston (Georgiana's suitor)--and the teller either Alveston or Georgiana! Then we'd have had characters that could be fully fleshed out, people we could really root for.<br />I would have thought James would scorn to use a deus ex machina: a family of Darcy servants living near the murder scene. James' great mystery novels give you all the information you need up front and don't need 11th-hour confessions and suchlike. The solution develops almost inevitably out of the criminal's personality. Here, the writing often TELLS the reader, instead of showing him. This book would be much better if we could HEAR the conversations we are only told ABOUT later, once the trial is over (and we are no longer interested anyway). And why have Darcy retell the story of his error-filled courtship, when we've read it all before?<br />Grammatical errors and solecisms throughout, while of lesser concern, are nonetheless jarring. Austen would never have used expressions like, \\"to fill you in.\\" All in all, this book compares very poorly with James' other books. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else wrote it.<br />For mystery fans who were disappointed by this book, I'd like to recommend Dorothy Sayers' The Nine Tailors or Agatha Christie's Sleeping Murder.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie, however my 4 year old niece was less interested. I loved all of the characters & the animation was great also.

0553386697|5.0|This book will help the parents of the children I work with SO MUCH!! The book was in very good shape.
B00AH8U3UC|1.0|The first two seasons were the best. This season was full of grown men acting like 20 something year olds parading around town with young beautiful women. All the while their one liners are getting old and tired. The one actress who seemed like the only grown up on this season was Karen. The  story lines were weak silly and just plain boring at times. Stop while you're ahead and end this series so the fans will remember the good episodes.
B003QOCTOM|1.0|Took about 10 seconds into the pilot to see that this television program was going to use a million plot holes and the usual glossy girl formulas to \\"hook\\" people into watching. A waste of $1.99. I am stunned that so many reviewed this and thought it good, much less great.
0307742997|5.0|A snowman will never be the same again.  I loved this book because it kept me riveted and never have I ever \\"gasped\\" out loud while reading a book until this one!  I'm going to find other books by this author!
0385344228|5.0|Very well written. Good plot line. Good character development and dialogue. A modern day story unfortunately. Suprise ending. Looking forward to reading more Landay.
B0000004F9|1.0|If this repackage is the \\"Big Beat\\" reissue, it is a ripoff and it will ruin our listening experience of two milestones in modern music. For one thing, volume 1 and 2 were carelessly packed on the same CD, a debatable choice, but let's say not dramatic. Where it hurts is the passage from one track to the other, where audible ticks and music discontinuity kills the original music flow.<br /><br />This is particularity annoying on volume 2. Theoretically there are 20 titles or so on the album, but when it came out, we listened to side one and then side two has a whole, not even noticing the passage from one song to the other. But this re-edition artificially reminds you that the track has changed, certainly not the way this masterpiece was intended.<br /><br />I simply threw this re-edition in the garbage and ordered the single re-editions, hoping I'll get better quality.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|couldn't wait for g5 to come out with a new game!  interesting storyline. they should really rework the &quot;free teaser&quot; routine and just sell the game outright at a cheaper price. so many people I know just play the demo then wont spend the $ to get full game....
B008HK3XKO|2.0|The item had a bad smell when it arrived - so much so that I did not want to have it around my new born.  After a couple of weeks it still smells but not so strong.  The case does not realiably turn the kindle on or off when it is openned or closed.  The case will not always stay proped up as in the picture especially if you use the touch screen.  Wish I had paid $20 more to get the leather official Kindle case that my sister got - much better and worth the money.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|First, I love the actors Bruce Willis and Mark Wahlberg.  The genre of this movie is what drew me to it...held my attention right to the end.  Oh, and what an ending...intriguing!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is an absolutely 5 star film and soundtrack!!  After all these years of being unknown, it's time for Sixto Rodriguez to be recognized.  His music and story are unbelievable!!  Start spreading the news about \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" and Sixto.....

B009GXHOW4|5.0|PocketInvEditor is perfect for building huge castles and city's on Minecraft Pocket Edition. It is also great for changing a spawn point, seeing what's in a chest, and adding items from a huge list into your inventory. Plus you can add extra or infinite hearts to your character. I personally love it, because it dose what it says, and you don't have to uninstall minecraft!

B009ERK1T0|5.0|I don't know if Koi No Yokan is better than Diamond Eyes, but it sure is close - and as far as I'm concerned, they're both perfect albums, and the two best in the history of this band.  Deftones have always been a creative band, but in the last two records they've upped the creativity and paired it with an ability to flawlessly execute all their ideas and ambitions.  Abe's drumming is better than ever.  Chino's singing, while always the best thing about this band, has reached new heights as he reaches out of his comfort zone and pursues some stranger and more alluring melodies.  Frank Delgado's soundscapes continue to improve each record - this is his best LP by far, in my opinion.  Koi No Yokan features the best bass lines in Deftones history, easily - check out Sergio Vega's positively nasty work on \\"Gauze\\" (so sorry Chi, one love).  But by far the thing that has made the last two records so perfect is the riffs.  Deftones never had great riffs in my opinion (their biggest flaw), but now they're all over the place.  Steph Carpenter's monster eight string tone absolutely crushes when he rips into some of the beautifully heavy riffs on this record.  For god's sake, \\"Rosemary\\" sounds like an Electric Wizard song played through Fredrik Thordendal's pedals with Chino singing over top of it.  I was speechless when I first heard it.  I didn't think Deftones had this kind of doom metal track in them.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan is, in my opinion, easily Deftones most innovative, visionary record.  I'm hearing a heavy, doomy Pixies in parts of \\"Romantic Dreams\\" that lets me know, finally, these guys have found a way to mix their metal and indie rock influences into an impossibly heavy, daringly unique and impenetrable brew, in that it's hard to pick out which parts are \\"metal\\" and which parts are Chino's post punk shoegazing.  Elsewhere, there's post rock atmosphere creeping around every corner, no doubt the work of Chino and Mr. Delgado, making this the most foreboding, eerieDeftones album yet.  And I'm finally hearing whispers of bands like Jawbox and Fugazi that Chino's been citing as an influence for years - the squiggly, dissonant guitar leads in \\"Graphic Nature\\" scream Washington, DC 1993.  Hey, there ARE leads on this Deftones record, something I can't say has been a huge part of their sound.  It's so refreshing to hear this amazing band grow, after all the success they've achieved.  They are still pushing themselves, which bodes well for the future.<br /><br />I'll close with saying that I listen to the song \\"Tempest\\" about 5 times a day.  It just be might be the best Deftones song yet.  Astonishingly good heavy metal, showing an absolute mastery of the quiet/loud, push pull dynamic, with an absolute ear worm of a chorus hook.  Without a doubt, the moment when the main riff first comes in is the best 5 seconds of music I've heard in years - goosebumps every time.  Outstanding song, outstanding record.  A +.

B006H5120E|5.0|Bought this one when it was on sale.  Got a hell of a deal on it.  I don't have a 3D system so I don't care about any of that.  The Blu-ray is phenomenal.  The delivery of this disc to my home was expedient.  Many thanks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was an easy read with an unexpected twist at the end!  I love Nicholas Sparks and would highly recomend this book.
